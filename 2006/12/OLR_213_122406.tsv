14000	16000	Tonight, December 24th, 2006
16000	19000	Some new channels make their debut on the Wii
19000	22000	A California lawmaker targets spyware and games
22000	25000	And is Katamari about to roll over Xbox Live Arcade?
25000	28000	Orange Lounge Radio
55000	59000	The plague has returned, but not nearly as bad. I'm prepared for it this time around.
86000	88000	Dark Sakura
88000	90000	How was your gaming week?
90000	92000	I did! I did do that!
120000	123000	Super Pac-Man
150000	153000	It's too damn hard to play
181000	186000	I'd like to mention, just real quick, the story that I'm talking about, which I'll get into a little bit later
186000	188000	I reported back on October 29th
188000	191000	Just to give you an idea of how behind the times they are
191000	193000	He's stewing over there
193000	195000	I smell an angst bunny
195000	197000	Alright
197000	199000	We'll have to do the F-Fuse a little early this week
199000	201000	Well, we're probably getting rid of one of our pinballs
201000	203000	Oh, I'm sorry. Which one?
203000	206000	Thinking about possibly the Guns N' Roses trying to get in Indiana Jones
206000	209000	Are you that mad at Axl Rose for canceling the little Sacramento thing?
209000	211000	No, I don't care
211000	213000	Axl Rose is an ass
213000	215000	I don't care
215000	218000	But, um, Dan's been wanting an indie for a while
218000	220000	And that's pretty cool
220000	222000	When are you gonna get Pinbot?
222000	224000	I want one! Actually, we want Jackbot
224000	227000	I don't, you know, your fancy schmancy bootlegs or whatever
227000	229000	It's not a bootleg
229000	233000	Jackbot is the modern pinball version
233000	235000	Whatever, whatever
235000	237000	It's got the same tracks as Pinbot
237000	241000	And has the bonus segment from Bride of Pinbot
241000	243000	Alright, whatever
243000	245000	So it's really cool. However, we do have friends who have a Pinbot
245000	247000	So I can just go over there and play it anytime I want
247000	249000	But does it do the thing where it goes, I am Pinbot?
249000	250000	Yes
250000	251000	Okay, good
251000	252000	It is a fully functional Pinbot
252000	254000	And that game is fucking hard
254000	257000	On the NES it was pretty hard, too
257000	260000	Because on the NES it had the little aliens that would try to eat your ball
260000	263000	But the actual pinball machine is just difficult
263000	264000	I see
264000	266000	But I have a special place in my heart for Pinbot
266000	267000	Alright
267000	270000	Anything else you've played this week?
270000	272000	Besides playing with fire?
272000	276000	I did play with fire because I lit candles on the winter solstice
276000	280000	They need to make fire the game
280000	283000	Well, there's putting out fire the game
283000	285000	The brave firefighters
285000	286000	Okay, alright
286000	288000	That's a year-end award I'd like to see
288000	290000	Best use of fire in a game
290000	291000	I did
291000	293000	Well, there's also Burning Rangers back in the day
293000	294000	I played another game though
294000	295000	What's that?
295000	297000	I played that marine harpoon Sega game
297000	299000	Because I was at Walmart and I was bored
299000	303000	So I played the harpoon game
303000	304000	And how was that?
304000	305000	Sucks
305000	306000	Alright
306000	308000	You spend the first time you play it and after that it's like
308000	310000	This screen has burning
310000	311000	Fix
311000	313000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
313000	315000	How was my gaming week?
315000	316000	Okay
316000	318000	I played a lot of crappy games, unfortunately
318000	322000	I played Cars on the Wii and it sucked ass
322000	323000	I bought it for Nellie
323000	326000	She said she could try it and then she agreed it did suck ass
326000	330000	Then I kind of went back on what I said about Ubisoft
330000	332000	And I went and bought another Ubisoft game
332000	338000	And this only further proves that their games suck
338000	341000	Because I went and bought Monster 4x4 World Circuit
341000	344000	Despite the reviews, I said
344000	348000	Oh, they're just probably complaining because the graphics look like GameCube graphics
348000	352000	And it's not like we've been able to trust any major gaming press review recently anyway
352000	353000	Exactly
353000	356000	So, you know, I thought, hey, you know, what the hell
356000	359000	It sounds like it could be like Excite Truck
359000	360000	It's four players
360000	362000	That could be fun
362000	363000	No, it's not
363000	365000	It's a horrible game
365000	367000	Very awful
367000	368000	First off, the graphics suck
368000	370000	The controls suck
370000	372000	The game is boring
372000	373000	The music sucks
373000	376000	Every aspect about this game blows ass
376000	378000	And if I rented this game
378000	380000	I would immediately take it back
380000	383000	And say, what the hell is this piece of shit that you gave me
383000	386000	Because this is obviously not a real game
386000	387000	I've done that with a game before
387000	388000	But what game?
388000	393000	It was the WWF at the time, Thunder game
393000	394000	On Playstation
394000	397000	It was so bad that Dan and I took it back to Blockbuster
397000	398000	And had them trade it out
398000	404000	I seriously, I would urge anyone not to even consider this as an alternative to Excite Truck
404000	405000	This is not even close
405000	406000	I mean
406000	408000	Well most people don't like Excite Truck either
408000	411000	So they're just like, you know what, no racing on the Wii for me
411000	412000	Well
412000	414000	Are you going to pick up Need for Speed Carbon?
414000	415000	Give it one more shot?
415000	417000	No, I'm not picking up Need for Speed Carbon
417000	420000	Need for Speed Carbon, I know what kind of a game it is
420000	421000	And so I know it would be pretty decent
421000	424000	It's just not the same type of a game as Excite Truck
424000	425000	But
425000	427000	Monster 4x4 World Circuit, it's slow
427000	432000	But it comes with the Elite Steering Wheel peripheral
432000	434000	Oh yeah, the Elite Steering Wheel peripheral
434000	436000	That's a piece of shit
436000	439000	I brought it into the studio today, okay, you know
439000	443000	I brought it to have Christopher try it out so he can give a review on the next show
443000	444000	But it is awful
444000	446000	It is a really bad game
446000	449000	And I'm sorry, but they just
449000	451000	So they had six or seven launch games
451000	453000	Yeah, but they all sucked
453000	456000	Ubisoft, you're just trying to capitalize on the lack of titles
456000	457000	You know, being out there
457000	459000	And hoping people will get to buy this stuff
459000	462000	And you know what, I'm sure a lot of people bought this stuff
462000	463000	And
463000	466000	I don't know, maybe their kids liked it and stuff, but
466000	468000	It's just, it's an awful game
468000	471000	And once you play, you know, like Excite Truck or something like that
471000	473000	Or Need for Speed Carbon, you're just like, wow
473000	475000	What the hell is this shit
475000	476000	So
476000	479000	I urge you, do not buy this game
479000	481000	Because you'll only be disappointed
481000	484000	Do you think Ubisoft might be able to redeem themselves
484000	486000	With some of the later games that are coming out in 2007?
486000	489000	With, you know, 360, they've got some pretty big titles planned, right?
489000	493000	Well, 360, they've got Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter
493000	496000	Which looks okay, but it looks exactly the same as
496000	498000	Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 1
498000	501000	So, you know, Warfighter 2, great
501000	503000	I mean, seriously, I
503000	507000	I challenge you to look at the screenshots and be able to tell the two games apart
507000	508000	You can't
508000	510000	They look exactly the same, so
510000	512000	I don't know
512000	515000	But then again, people like stuff that's the same, so
515000	516000	It should be fine
516000	518000	And Rainbow Six Vegas, I heard, is pretty good
518000	519000	It's not my type of game
519000	520000	But
520000	523000	I've seen some of the stuff that they're coming out for the Wii
523000	525000	For, you know, say, and
525000	528000	It's not anything new, let me put it that way
528000	530000	It's just ports of old shit
530000	531000	That they're tacking the controls on
531000	534000	And they really need to come out and create some new games
534000	536000	And I'm not talking about Red Steel 2
536000	539000	I'm talking about a brand new game
539000	541000	Does Reggie need to come lay the smackdown?
541000	542000	I think so
542000	543000	I think
543000	545000	I think they're just looking at numbers, you know
545000	547000	And Red Steel sold really well
547000	548000	It's just
548000	550000	It wasn't that good of a game
550000	552000	You know, people were looking for another GoldenEye
552000	554000	And it was not GoldenEye
554000	556000	Alright, was that it?
556000	557000	That's it
557000	560000	Alright, My Gaming Week, nothing really new to report for you guys
560000	561000	I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff
561000	563000	I've been playing every extend extra
563000	565000	A little bit of Luminous 2 as well
565000	567000	Still playing Burnout on Xbox
567000	569000	And I'm getting very frustrated at how bad I suck at Burnout
569000	571000	Because, like, you know, the achievements
571000	574000	You, for one of them you have to get, like, all
574000	576000	Basically, the majority of the achievements are
576000	578000	You get all perfect ratings
578000	580000	In every difficulty level
580000	583000	Right? Well, I'm one star shy
583000	586000	In the very first basic difficulty level
586000	589000	There's one freaking race I cannot get a gold medal in
589000	591000	And therefore I'm not able to get a perfect
591000	594000	And it's frustrating the hell out of me how badly I suck at Burnout
594000	596000	So, I cry a lot
596000	598000	But it does give me an opportunity to use custom soundtracks
598000	600000	And, like, listen to, you know
600000	604000	Like, what's kind of funny is usually I'll put in the soundtrack to Wangen
604000	606000	And Midnight Maximum Tune
606000	608000	And I'll play Burnout to that
608000	610000	And it's kind of fun
610000	612000	So, yay for custom soundtracks
612000	614000	And, you know, I've been watching extra for play a lot of Excite Truck
614000	616000	By the way, I'd like to point out
616000	618000	He just finally got, just like as of a few moments ago
618000	620000	Got the very last trophy
620000	622000	The Super Duper Rings trophy
622000	624000	And says that nothing else happens
624000	626000	You just get all the trophies, that's it
626000	628000	But he's been using the SD card that Jamie got him for
628000	630000	Christmas to do all the custom soundtracks
630000	632000	He needs to get all the challenge modes finished
632000	634000	And I think that unlocks one other thing
634000	636000	That's minor
636000	638000	He's done every single possible thing he can do in race mode
638000	640000	I mean, I don't know anybody, besides Nelly
640000	642000	That's probably as obsessed with this game as X for his
642000	644000	Most people wrote off Excite Truck as kind of cheap
644000	646000	Compared to Xbox 360 racers
646000	648000	You've been playing it at my house
648000	650000	I have it at Dan House
650000	652000	Interesting, it's so interesting because
652000	654000	This game kind of got a lot of critical
654000	656000	Heat against it, but
656000	658000	It's really caught on with a lot of folks
658000	660000	That I've shown it to
660000	662000	They dig that, whereas
662000	664000	They don't get burnout
664000	666000	Burnout's too intimidating for them
666000	668000	Whereas me, I kind of prefer burnout, personally
668000	670000	To Excite Truck
670000	672000	I like Excite Truck
672000	674000	Yeah, I like Excite Truck
674000	676000	I think EA should take
676000	678000	Burnout and make Burnout off-road
678000	680000	And kind of compete with Excite Truck
680000	682000	Because it's kind of got the same
682000	684000	Formula, almost
684000	686000	The way that you score points and stuff
686000	688000	For doing drifts
688000	690000	Lack of online support being the biggest
690000	692000	Well, that's just, I know
692000	694000	It's lame, that really is lame
694000	696000	Lack of four player racing, stupid
696000	698000	I mean, come on
698000	700000	I really don't understand
700000	702000	Nintendo and just saying, oh you know
702000	704000	All these other consoles have been online
704000	706000	For the last two generations
706000	708000	No, we're just not gonna
708000	710000	We just don't feel it right now
710000	712000	No, you're stupid
712000	714000	You're stupid, stupid, stupid
714000	716000	But you can't help but wonder if Excite Truck
716000	718000	Is doing so well with the casual audience
718000	720000	How well, I mean
720000	722000	At least from our perspective, I don't know about you guys
722000	724000	Out there, but all of our friends
724000	726000	Who are only borderline into gaming
726000	728000	Are loving Excite Truck
728000	730000	And I can't help but wonder how Mario Kart's gonna do
730000	732000	Because you know that's inevitable
732000	734000	That we'll get a Mario Kart on the Wii eventually
734000	736000	Probably not until 2008
736000	738000	I hope it won't suck as bad as Double Dash
738000	740000	Because Double Dash blew ass
740000	742000	But the DS one was pretty rad
742000	744000	And that's the most recent one, really
744000	746000	Mario Kart 64
746000	748000	That's why it rocked
748000	750000	But the thing is though
750000	752000	It better have online play
752000	754000	Because if it doesn't
754000	756000	That's a huge mistake
756000	758000	And I think that they really should
758000	760000	Patch Excite Truck
760000	762000	So that it does have online play
762000	764000	Because that's major
764000	766000	Well they're not gonna patch it
766000	768000	That's just gonna be a feature in Excite Truck 2
768000	770000	Fine, then it better come out quick
770000	772000	Because I want another game
772000	774000	That if they did something sort of like
774000	776000	You know what Excite Truck reminds me of suddenly?
776000	778000	Is Cruis'n World
778000	780000	Sort of
780000	782000	I guess I can see that a little bit
782000	784000	Yeah, I can see that a little bit
784000	786000	If they had the multiplayer be
786000	788000	Sort of like how, what was that game?
788000	790000	Oh god, I can't remember
790000	792000	It's 2099
792000	794000	One of the racing games
794000	796000	It had the dial-in thing to where you could
796000	798000	You know what Excite Truck reminds me of?
798000	800000	You mean
800000	802000	Rush 2049
802000	804000	Yes, thank you
804000	806000	You know what Excite Truck reminds me of?
806000	808000	A woman
808000	810000	How?
810000	812000	Driving
812000	814000	Woman driver of the game
814000	816000	No, I don't drive like that
816000	818000	Yes you do
818000	820000	No I don't!
820000	822000	I drive very well, thank you
822000	824000	You know you reward yourself with stars
824000	826000	For the air you get in your vehicle
826000	828000	Whenever you go over
828000	830000	Hey, I've been driving since I was 16
830000	832000	And I got my first speeding ticket
832000	834000	So bite my ass in a non-literal way
834000	836000	So bite my ass in a non-literal way
836000	838000	Anyway
838000	840000	Anything else on Excite Truck?
840000	842000	Oh, it was still my gaming week
842000	844000	Eh, who cares
844000	846000	DS Final Fantasy III
846000	848000	Which I'm loving more and more
848000	850000	Even though it's kind of hard
850000	852000	And I finally got the 4 star difficulty in Elite Beat Agents
852000	854000	God, I love that game
854000	856000	I really do
856000	858000	Thank you again for the year
858000	860000	I'll tell you that much
860000	862000	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick
862000	864000	Before we get into the news
864000	866000	Next week's show is also going to be pre-taped
866000	868000	We're pre-taped tonight, we're not live as we mentioned previously
868000	870000	But those of you guys on our audio RSS
870000	872000	Also known as podcasting
872000	874000	Have a chance to download the program
874000	876000	And so hello folks
876000	878000	Next week is going to be the same deal
878000	880000	However, next week is going to be a special show
880000	882000	Since we're anticipating there's not going to be a lot of news
882000	884000	Due to the holiday season
884000	886000	It's sort of a year-end special
886000	888000	And we're inviting a lot of our friends
888000	890000	As in other podcasters
890000	892000	Other shows on OLR
892000	894000	Guests that we've had previously on the program
894000	896000	And people in the industry
896000	898000	We're inviting a whole ton of them to come on
898000	900000	For little mini interviews
900000	902000	We're going to play a little game
902000	904000	And I'll give you more details next week
904000	906000	We're going to play a little game that will help everybody give an input
906000	908000	On what the best stuff was in 2006
908000	910000	And what we're going to look forward to in 2007
910000	912000	So by the way
912000	914000	If you are another podcaster
914000	916000	An industry type or something
916000	918000	And you want to be on the program next week
918000	920000	Drop me a line ASAP
920000	922000	rob at orangeoltrader.com
922000	924000	I'm the one scheduling all that stuff
924000	926000	So we definitely want to have you guys on
926000	928000	Also we want to mention
928000	930000	dig.com just recently added podcasting
930000	932000	To their listing
932000	934000	And we want to thank you guys who've dug us
934000	936000	Considering we haven't really mentioned it on the show
936000	938000	Or on the front page of the site
938000	940000	We did give it a shout out on the forums
940000	942000	They've been helping out with that effort as well
942000	944000	We've gotten 60 something digs
944000	946000	On the podcast, that's pretty cool
946000	948000	So if you feel like going and supporting that a little more
948000	950000	That would be awesome because it all helps to spread the word
950000	952000	Which as you know
952000	954000	Independent radio has to rely on
954000	956000	To get the news out there
956000	958000	Because we don't have no magazine that gives us free
958000	960000	Two, three page spreads in to promote our product
960000	962000	So you have to go on there
962000	964000	And vote
964000	966000	And isn't it interesting
966000	968000	That even that being said
968000	970000	Because they're so out there
970000	972000	And so pushed
972000	974000	They end up getting dug the most too
974000	976000	Well they do have employees that can go and dig
976000	978000	I suppose that's true too
978000	980000	Anywho, let's get into some gaming news
980000	982000	Starting with Loki
982000	984000	And of course this week
984000	986000	We had two updates to it
986000	988000	The forecast channel
988000	990000	And the internet channel being added
990000	992000	The forecast channel is, well, weather
992000	994000	And it was pretty simplistic
994000	996000	But fun to play around with
996000	998000	I think we all spun the globe a lot
998000	1000000	Because I was bored
1000000	1002000	I think we all spun the globe
1002000	1004000	That's what you do with globes
1004000	1006000	When I was in school and I'd find a globe
1006000	1008000	I'd spin it
1008000	1010000	We would try to find the funniest city name
1010000	1012000	Is what we used to do with the globe
1012000	1014000	I would take stickers
1014000	1016000	And paste them all over the globe
1016000	1018000	I was very disappointed though
1018000	1020000	No five day forecast for Antarctica
1020000	1022000	How am I supposed to know what the weather is going to be like
1022000	1024000	For the rest of the week
1024000	1026000	The forecast for Antarctica
1026000	1028000	COLD MOTHERFUCKER
1028000	1030000	Watch out for penguins
1030000	1032000	Anyways
1032000	1034000	So those have been the launch
1034000	1036000	The of course internet channel is free
1036000	1038000	Until June 2007
1038000	1040000	Or June 30, 2007
1040000	1042000	Which it'll be pay afterwards
1042000	1044000	Five bucks afterwards
1044000	1046000	Right now I guess they're considering it a beta
1046000	1048000	Why is it not done
1048000	1050000	Damn you Opera
1050000	1052000	I mean come on, finish the fucking thing
1052000	1054000	Whatever
1054000	1056000	So they're working the kinks out
1056000	1058000	It'll be updated I'm assuming for free
1058000	1060000	Everyone's assuming, oh we're all going to have to pay for it
1060000	1062000	In July or whatever
1062000	1064000	I don't think so
1064000	1066000	I think they're just going to update it
1066000	1068000	And so look forward to that
1068000	1070000	And then of course I think in January
1070000	1072000	We're going to be getting the news channel
1072000	1076000	Which hopefully will have a way to sign up for different RSS feeds and stuff
1076000	1080000	Because I don't really give a shit about the world news
1080000	1082000	Whatever
1082000	1086000	Yeah they're really trying to turn the Wii into the front page of Yahoo
1086000	1090000	Well what do you think though about the browser channel
1090000	1092000	I think it's pretty good
1092000	1094000	I'm glad it does support Flash
1094000	1096000	Because you'll see a lot more from OLR Wii.com
1096000	1100000	I've got some good plans for that
1100000	1102000	Hurry hurry
1102000	1106000	And what's good though is it's definitely a lot easier to browse than say the PSP browser
1106000	1108000	That's for sure
1108000	1110000	I don't know how long it will be before we actually
1110000	1112000	It's actually kind of weird
1112000	1114000	It's a little bit easier to browse than the PS3 browser too
1114000	1118000	Because apparently their text entry sucks too
1118000	1122000	But I'm wondering how long it will be before we see a 360 browser
1122000	1124000	Because they got to jump on the bandwagon
1124000	1126000	I don't know
1126000	1128000	It's pretty cool
1128000	1130000	I know that the Wiicade stuff doesn't work too well
1130000	1132000	Everyone was hoping that site would be good
1132000	1134000	But they have to downgrade all their games for Flash 7
1134000	1136000	It was okay
1136000	1138000	They're pretty fun
1138000	1140000	That's pretty much all I have
1140000	1142000	It's a good start
1142000	1144000	Did you check out any YouTube
1144000	1146000	Because I went to YouTube
1146000	1148000	Not bad
1148000	1150000	It's pretty cool that YouTube will work on the Wii browser
1150000	1152000	The only problem is that you've got that navigation bar
1152000	1154000	That does not go away
1154000	1156000	That sits there on the bottom fifth of the screen
1156000	1158000	So when you make YouTube full screen
1158000	1160000	Your video is still only in a tiny little box
1160000	1162000	Well it's not a tiny box
1162000	1164000	But when you're looking at a big widescreen TV
1164000	1166000	It doesn't take up a big portion of it
1166000	1168000	So I kind of wish there was a way to make that stuff bigger
1168000	1170000	Because YouTube is a pretty awesome site
1170000	1172000	To be looking at on the Wii
1172000	1174000	You can get everybody in the living room
1174000	1176000	And what I did is I created my own personal page
1176000	1178000	Finally on YouTube
1178000	1180000	And I started bookmarking videos I really like
1180000	1182000	Like the banana muffin
1182000	1184000	That our listeners are going to have no idea what I'm talking about
1184000	1186000	But you can bookmark these videos
1186000	1188000	And play them for people
1188000	1190000	So that's cool
1190000	1192000	I like the Wii browser as well
1192000	1194000	I'm looking forward to whatever you are able to come up with
1194000	1196000	For OLRWII.com
1196000	1198000	Because OLRPSP.com
1198000	1200000	That site is still getting
1200000	1202000	Even though we haven't really done a lot of maintenance
1202000	1204000	It's still getting talked about
1204000	1206000	And it looks great on the PSP
1206000	1208000	You did a really good job with that
1208000	1210000	So hats off to you
1210000	1212000	Looking forward to seeing what you can do with the Wii
1212000	1214000	Really?
1214000	1216000	I can't help it
1216000	1218000	Yes we're looking forward to seeing what Matt can do with his Wii
1218000	1220000	Let me talk
1220000	1222000	Also about some other Wii news
1222000	1224000	A lot of folks are talking about Virtual Console
1224000	1226000	And I thought it was quite humorous
1226000	1228000	That people thought Nintendo was going to throw them
1228000	1230000	A free game at Christmas
1230000	1232000	Well I don't know
1232000	1234000	I heard rumors that Sony is doing something similar
1234000	1236000	But I guess
1236000	1238000	Folks thought Nintendo was going to throw them
1238000	1240000	Super Mario Brothers, one of their biggest games
1240000	1242000	As a free game
1242000	1244000	Considering how many times we've had to buy
1244000	1246000	Super Mario Brothers
1246000	1248000	Like the Game Boy one they had
1248000	1250000	And the Super Nintendo one they had
1250000	1252000	And all that crap
1252000	1254000	You'd think they could give us it for free
1254000	1256000	But no, it's coming out for 500 Wii points
1256000	1258000	On Christmas Day
1258000	1260000	But also coming out, ToeJam and Earl
1260000	1262000	R-Type for the TurboGrafx-16
1262000	1264000	And
1264000	1266000	Super Castlevania
1266000	1268000	Which should be pretty awesome
1268000	1270000	Street Fighter 2 as well
1270000	1272000	Even though I don't really plan on checking that one out
1272000	1274000	Yeah you like R-Type?
1274000	1276000	Urban Champion
1276000	1278000	I think it was Baseball
1278000	1280000	By the way, Urban Champion kind of sucks
1280000	1282000	Like
1282000	1284000	I know a lot of people think it might be cool
1284000	1286000	Because they haven't really heard of it
1286000	1288000	But keep in mind this game was made like
1288000	1290000	Before Double Dragon
1290000	1292000	Before a lot of that other stuff
1292000	1294000	Urban Champion kind of sucks
1294000	1296000	It's not going to be worth the 500 points I'm sorry to say
1296000	1298000	We need Bad Dudes
1298000	1300000	New Year's Day is kind of weak
1300000	1302000	But Christmas Day is very strong in releases
1302000	1304000	Are you a bad enough dude to save the president?
1304000	1306000	No it sucked on the NES
1306000	1308000	It totally sucked
1308000	1310000	Compared to the arcade
1310000	1312000	Did they make Bad Dudes on Genesis?
1312000	1314000	I can't remember
1314000	1316000	I thought they made it on another system besides just the Nintendo
1316000	1318000	Oh well
1318000	1320000	So you have those releases
1320000	1322000	To look forward to on Christmas
1324000	1326000	Well speaking of releases
1326000	1328000	Well
1328000	1330000	There are some
1330000	1332000	Next week in the UK
1332000	1334000	And by some I mean three
1334000	1336000	Of course on the 25th we have Wii Sports
1336000	1338000	Duh
1338000	1340000	On the 29th we've got
1340000	1342000	What the hell retailer is going to be open on the 25th in the UK
1342000	1344000	To sell Wii Sports
1344000	1346000	Or whatever whatever
1346000	1348000	I'm like yeah
1348000	1350000	And then also two PSP releases
1350000	1352000	Free Running
1352000	1354000	And Lego Star Wars 2
1354000	1356000	The original trilogy
1356000	1358000	On the 29th
1358000	1360000	Makes sense though that it's a slow week in the UK
1360000	1362000	It's going to be pretty slow over here too
1362000	1364000	Right Loki?
1364000	1366000	Yeah it's extremely slow
1366000	1368000	I want to say there's actually nothing coming out
1368000	1370000	I'm pretty confident in that
1370000	1372000	And if anything it was just
1372000	1374000	A crappy ass DS game
1374000	1376000	And I really mean crappy like
1376000	1378000	Board game collection type crappy
1378000	1380000	Anyway so but we do have some
1380000	1382000	Exclusive release dates for you
1382000	1384000	And I'd like to touch on something I was talking about earlier
1384000	1386000	In the show about how websites are carrying
1386000	1388000	Exclusive stories that certain games
1388000	1390000	Are coming out and that they have the first
1390000	1392000	News on it
1392000	1394000	There's actually a news art
1394000	1396000	News piece that's being run by GoNintendo.com
1396000	1398000	Which is actually originally covered on
1398000	1400000	Codenamerevolution.com
1400000	1402000	Talking about High School Musical being in
1402000	1404000	Development for the Wii
1404000	1406000	In case you forgot we did mention
1406000	1408000	That back in episode 206
1408000	1410000	Way back in the month of
1410000	1412000	October and
1412000	1414000	Gave you a release date of that as well
1414000	1416000	And in case you
1416000	1418000	Haven't heard of that I believe it's
1418000	1420000	Coming out in May
1420000	1422000	But who cares it's High School Musical the game
1422000	1424000	I put this right up there with like happy feet
1424000	1426000	Exactly it's a
1426000	1428000	It's a crappy game
1428000	1430000	Can't you guys just kiss and make up it's really not worth fighting over
1430000	1432000	No it's worth fighting over
1432000	1434000	Everything is worth fighting
1434000	1436000	No but seriously so
1436000	1438000	That's coming out and you know
1438000	1440000	Great we did have a few other things
1440000	1442000	And these were actually some of these were mentioned
1442000	1444000	During the week you know I had them posted in our show
1444000	1446000	World but you know during the week more news
1446000	1448000	Came out and we had you know some dates
1448000	1450000	Being released of course like Prince of Persia
1450000	1452000	Rival Swords for the Wii
1452000	1454000	Being announced by Ubisoft and
1454000	1456000	That's coming out March 14th
1456000	1458000	What they didn't mention
1458000	1460000	Though is that Driver
1460000	1462000	Parallel Lines will also be coming out on
1462000	1464000	The Wii and the PSP
1464000	1466000	That is also the same day on March
1466000	1468000	14th and a week
1468000	1470000	Prior they're going to be releasing their
1470000	1472000	Game for the new Ninja Turtles
1472000	1474000	Movie and that's coming out on
1474000	1476000	Playstation 2, GameCube, 360
1476000	1478000	The Wii, the DS and the Game Boy Advance
1478000	1480000	And that's coming out
1480000	1482000	On the 7th
1482000	1484000	Also from Ubisoft we've got
1484000	1486000	A sequel to their really crappy Game Boy
1486000	1488000	Advance game Dogs, Dogs 2
1488000	1490000	Which is coming out on the
1490000	1492000	7th of March as well
1492000	1494000	They have a music game coming out at the end of
1494000	1496000	February called Guitar Hit
1496000	1498000	For the PSP, no word on what that is
1498000	1500000	But it's probably some music and rhythm game
1500000	1502000	Probably is ripping off on
1502000	1504000	I've never seen a guitar rhythm game before
1504000	1506000	This is a completely new concept for me
1506000	1508000	It's on the PSP
1508000	1510000	So I'm not sure how well that's going to work
1510000	1512000	That's coming out on
1512000	1514000	February 28th
1514000	1516000	Splinter Cell Double Agent finally making its way
1516000	1518000	To the Playstation 3 as they announced earlier this week
1518000	1520000	That's going to be March 14th
1520000	1522000	Atari has
1522000	1524000	Two Dragon Ball Z games coming out
1524000	1526000	Dragon Ball Z Shin Budokai and other
1526000	1528000	For PSP
1528000	1530000	And other Shin Budokai games
1530000	1532000	And that's coming out March 14th
1532000	1534000	And then Dragon Ball Z
1534000	1536000	Haru Kannaru
1536000	1538000	It's a very long name
1538000	1540000	Haru Kannaru
1540000	1542000	Densetsu
1542000	1544000	Legendary
1544000	1546000	For the DS
1546000	1548000	And that's a mouthful right there
1548000	1550000	That's coming out on the 21st of March
1550000	1552000	And then
1552000	1554000	You're going to love this
1554000	1556000	Elder Scrolls Oblivion for the Playstation 3
1556000	1558000	Delayed yet again
1558000	1560000	To the end of February
1560000	1562000	Coming out now February 27th
1562000	1564000	What the hell
1564000	1566000	G, where have I heard this Oblivion getting delayed
1566000	1568000	For the new console thing before
1568000	1570000	Where have I heard this before?
1570000	1572000	2006 maybe?
1572000	1574000	Yeah, seriously
1574000	1576000	So it's being delayed yet again
1576000	1578000	I don't know why they don't have it done yet
1578000	1580000	But whatever
1580000	1582000	Alright
1582000	1584000	Well thanks for the exclusive look at some of the US news
1584000	1586000	And so nobody else has mentioned that whole Oblivion
1586000	1588000	Getting delayed thing, huh?
1588000	1590000	No, no, but I'm sure a few months
1590000	1592000	From now they'll mention, oh by the way it's been
1592000	1594000	Delayed, we have the exclusive news on it
1594000	1596000	Because everyone seems to ignore
1596000	1598000	Us
1598000	1600000	We're not a real legitimate site
1600000	1602000	Because we love game in our title
1602000	1604000	Coming out in Japan
1604000	1606000	Also kind of slim pickins in Japan
1606000	1608000	This week, but you do get the Japanese
1608000	1610000	Version of Prey on the 360
1610000	1612000	This week on December 28th
1612000	1614000	Also on the Playstation 3
1614000	1616000	You're going to get Formula 1 Championship
1616000	1618000	Edition coming out there
1618000	1620000	Coming to the Nintendo Wii
1620000	1622000	You get, not a lot, you get a new memory
1622000	1624000	Card there
1624000	1626000	Coming to the Playstation 2 you get Formula 1
1626000	1628000	2006
1628000	1630000	Yunimishi and Himihibi
1630000	1632000	Princess Days
1632000	1634000	Does that sound like a title you're interested in playing?
1634000	1636000	Sounds kind of cute
1636000	1638000	Coming for the Nintendo DS
1638000	1640000	We have just a bunch of accessories
1640000	1642000	Some pens, some covers
1642000	1644000	And an Animal Crossing mascot
1644000	1646000	Strap and a carrying bag
1646000	1648000	For Animal Crossing
1648000	1650000	Sounds like it might be kind of fun
1650000	1652000	You do get Dragon Quest Monsters though on the DS
1652000	1654000	Dragon Quest games are always
1654000	1656000	Pretty big deals over there in Japan
1656000	1658000	Even though it's a spin-off game still
1658000	1660000	Going to be pretty big
1660000	1662000	And that's really all I have
1662000	1664000	Not a whole lot, it's a slow week over there too
1664000	1666000	And as I was going to say, the High School Musical game
1666000	1668000	I said May, because I was just completely pulling it out
1668000	1670000	Of my head, but I looked back in the showroom for
1670000	1672000	Episode 206
1672000	1674000	And apparently it was July 11th
1674000	1676000	May was Pirates of the Caribbean 3
1676000	1678000	Let it go, Jesus
1678000	1680000	Okay, I gotta get my information correct
1680000	1682000	Okay, just in case
1682000	1684000	Fair enough, fair enough
1684000	1686000	Anyways
1686000	1688000	Now that we're moving on from our angst aren't we?
1688000	1690000	I think so, yeah
1690000	1692000	Well there is talk of
1692000	1694000	DS and Wii
1694000	1696000	connectivity coming around
1696000	1698000	They're basically comparing it
1698000	1700000	To how it was with
1700000	1704000	The GameCube and Game Boy Advance
1704000	1706000	But they're saying that they're hoping that it's
1706000	1708000	Going to be a lot better
1708000	1710000	Whereas with the Xbox 360
1710000	1712000	Connects to your PC for
1712000	1714000	Streaming video and media
1714000	1716000	They're talking about more improving gameplay
1716000	1718000	And offering new experiences
1718000	1720000	The best news about this is that I won't have to
1720000	1722000	Buy some fucking cable to do it
1722000	1724000	Like you had to do on the GameCube, remember?
1724000	1726000	To connect to your Advance or whatever
1726000	1728000	But then it didn't work with the Advance SP
1728000	1729000	Nope, it didn't
1729000	1731000	It was so annoying, so annoying
1731000	1733000	Damn you Nintendo, I'm still mad at you over that
1733000	1735000	That's why I still held onto my GBA
1735000	1737000	Because I have to tell you what I want to see
1737000	1739000	Come out again
1739000	1741000	Is the Pac-Man Plus
1741000	1743000	Or Pac-Man Versus
1743000	1745000	Oh, Pac-Man Versus, yeah that would actually be a really
1745000	1747000	Fun download title for the Wii, wouldn't it?
1747000	1749000	I actually
1749000	1751000	We still randomly play
1751000	1753000	That game because it's so much
1753000	1755000	Fantastic, I mean it was such a fun idea
1755000	1757000	Well also I think about, you know, they should really give
1757000	1759000	Four Swords another chance, because I think a lot of
1759000	1761000	People didn't get into Four Swords on the GameCube
1761000	1763000	Because of the fact you had to have all these people
1763000	1765000	Had to have an Advance and all these people had to have the
1765000	1767000	Cables, and it wasn't usually hard to find people
1767000	1769000	With an Advance, but it was hard to find people with the
1769000	1771000	Cables to play the game with
1771000	1773000	Same thing with Crystal Chronicles
1773000	1775000	I think we actually had to have two or three sets of cables
1775000	1777000	At my house just because of that
1777000	1779000	Yeah, but you're, you know, you're a nerd
1779000	1781000	Well I mean, it was just that we ended up
1781000	1783000	Dan worked at Gamestop at the time
1783000	1785000	Found him cheap, we'd just hold on to him
1785000	1787000	But it was really
1787000	1789000	I think in that respect though
1789000	1791000	It's, hey we make it require this
1791000	1793000	We can sell more stuff
1793000	1795000	So, I don't know
1795000	1797000	I'm really, really hoping that we get
1797000	1799000	Not just
1799000	1801000	You know, like the one or two ones
1801000	1803000	That were out before, but get a whole series
1803000	1805000	Of games that interact
1805000	1807000	Between the Wii and the DS
1807000	1809000	I could really go for that
1809000	1811000	Is this how they could do that, Loki?
1811000	1813000	How they could get more games to interact
1813000	1815000	With both systems
1815000	1817000	Well, probably just
1817000	1819000	They'll probably start adding it on
1819000	1821000	Kind of like they did with the Game Boy Advance
1821000	1823000	Stuff, you know, where like, remember Metroid Prime
1823000	1825000	Where you could download the original Metroid
1825000	1827000	To it and stuff like that
1827000	1829000	They'll probably start with gimmicky
1829000	1831000	Stuff like that, hopefully maybe the new
1831000	1833000	Animal Crossing will allow you to download some games
1833000	1835000	Dream on!
1835000	1837000	Actually, I have an idea
1837000	1839000	They should do
1839000	1841000	Be able to turn your Wii into a demo station
1841000	1843000	Yeah, that's been a long time
1843000	1845000	Rumor, yeah, I remember
1845000	1847000	Nobody's ever seen if that's really going to happen
1847000	1849000	But yeah, the rumor was you'd be able to download
1849000	1851000	DS demos through your Wii
1851000	1853000	Just like you're supposed to be able to do PSP demos through the PS3
1853000	1855000	But if an Animal Crossing were to come out on Wii
1855000	1857000	That means that we'd probably get the island
1857000	1859000	Back, that should be fun
1859000	1861000	I think everybody's waiting for Animal Crossing
1861000	1863000	On the Wii, I don't know, I'm a little skeptical this time
1863000	1865000	Because I was so excited about Animal Crossing
1865000	1867000	On the DS
1867000	1869000	I was so excited about it and then played it for like two weeks
1869000	1871000	And then I was done
1871000	1873000	I think you should have a Mii game
1873000	1875000	You know, you make your Wii on your
1875000	1877000	Your Mii on your Wii and download your Mii
1877000	1879000	To the DS with a little thing as like sub games
1879000	1881000	I guess anything is possible
1881000	1883000	Anything's possible
1883000	1885000	I don't know
1885000	1887000	But one thing that they're probably not going to have
1887000	1889000	In Animal Crossing is the
1889000	1891000	Wiimote throwing game
1891000	1893000	Because they've been getting a lot of heat
1893000	1895000	On the whole Wiimote strap thing
1895000	1897000	In fact, of course, as I predicted last week
1897000	1899000	Immediately the next day
1899000	1901000	Class action lawsuit
1901000	1903000	Filed for the stupid Wii strap things
1903000	1905000	And of course
1905000	1907000	He's so humble, isn't he?
1907000	1909000	Hey, I mean, I'm not taking credit for that
1909000	1911000	Because anybody could have guessed that
1911000	1913000	That's just stupid
1913000	1915000	I mean, of course it was coming
1915000	1917000	Because people were looking to profit from all this stuff
1917000	1919000	So, some company, Greenwelling LLP
1919000	1921000	Filed a national
1921000	1923000	Class action lawsuit
1923000	1925000	On behalf of the owners
1925000	1927000	Of Nintendo Wii, thank you them
1927000	1929000	Because, you know, all these
1929000	1931000	Wii owners are in dire need
1931000	1933000	Of some money
1933000	1935000	No, you know what? You don't represent me
1935000	1937000	I am a Nintendo Wii owner since launch day
1937000	1939000	And you don't represent me
1939000	1941000	Let that be known on this program
1941000	1943000	Anyway, you need to say
1943000	1945000	I represent Wii owners except
1945000	1947000	Rob from Orange Lawns Radio
1947000	1949000	And me
1949000	1951000	You should just say you represent stupid people
1951000	1953000	They said that basically
1953000	1955000	The class action lawsuit
1955000	1957000	Rose as a result of the defective nature
1957000	1959000	Of the Wii remotes
1959000	1961000	Basically saying that the wrist straps
1961000	1963000	Were not, you know
1963000	1965000	Strong enough to withstand
1965000	1967000	The use of the player
1967000	1969000	And that Nintendo
1969000	1971000	Did not include enough
1971000	1973000	Instruction on how to use
1973000	1975000	The Wii remote properly
1975000	1977000	What? Oh my god
1977000	1979000	That's a Wii remote up their butt
1979000	1981000	That's a retard, I'm sorry
1981000	1983000	No, no, that's insulting to retarded people
1983000	1985000	That's just an idiot
1985000	1987000	I'm sorry, I can't deal with that
1987000	1989000	And that it's basically
1989000	1991000	You know
1991000	1993000	What they're saying though
1993000	1995000	And they're looking to do is
1995000	1997000	The class action lawsuit is going to
1997000	1999000	Basically correct
1999000	2001000	They want to correct the defect in the Wii remote
2001000	2003000	And provide a refund to the purchase
2003000	2005000	Or replace the defective Wii remotes
2005000	2007000	And
2007000	2009000	You know
2009000	2011000	I think they're trying to also claim damages
2011000	2013000	For stuff that people have done
2013000	2015000	I can't help but think though
2015000	2017000	That they've sent out emails
2017000	2019000	There's a stupid indicator in the front of
2019000	2021000	All the games
2021000	2023000	It's built into the games for god's sake
2023000	2025000	Built into the consoles on every single game
2025000	2027000	Says the Wii strap thing
2027000	2029000	They've offered this free replacement program
2029000	2031000	If you want to replace your Wii straps
2031000	2033000	They'll do it for free
2033000	2035000	I told you in the instruction mails
2035000	2037000	Do not swing wildly
2037000	2039000	And you don't need to swing wildly
2039000	2041000	And the commercials don't show them swinging wildly
2041000	2043000	Granted they show them diving across the couch
2043000	2045000	But that's not swinging wildly
2045000	2047000	That's just acting like an idiot
2047000	2049000	Well I think the best comparison
2049000	2051000	I heard about that though
2051000	2053000	Is that like you know in a commercial
2053000	2055000	For a new car
2055000	2057000	They show them driving in the wilderness
2057000	2059000	Doing all these stunts
2059000	2061000	And they always have that little thing
2061000	2063000	You know that you don't do that with a regular car
2063000	2065000	You just know that
2065000	2067000	Common sense tells you that
2067000	2069000	Common sense tells you
2069000	2071000	If you dive across the couch
2071000	2073000	You're likely to break the couch or a lamp
2073000	2075000	Or your wiimote
2075000	2077000	But that's the risk you take
2077000	2079000	It had warnings
2079000	2081000	They made the warnings abundant
2081000	2083000	Three words
2083000	2085000	Idiot
2085000	2087000	Well this comes down to Nintendo
2087000	2089000	Of course this is without merit
2089000	2091000	We're going to see what we just said
2091000	2093000	About the Wii
2093000	2095000	That they've given way more than enough
2095000	2097000	Precautions and stuff
2097000	2099000	And people are stupid
2099000	2101000	It's just like you know
2101000	2103000	You don't see lawsuits out there for people
2103000	2105000	Throwing baseball bats and hitting somebody with them
2105000	2107000	And them suing the baseball bat company
2107000	2109000	Because they're stupid and let go of the bat
2109000	2111000	They know they're not supposed to do that
2111000	2113000	Well just like you know you're not supposed to swing
2113000	2115000	The remote like a 90 mile an hour fastball
2115000	2117000	And just because your hands became slippery
2117000	2119000	Well you know if I had a knife
2119000	2121000	And my hands were slippery and I accidentally
2121000	2123000	Stabbed someone with the knife
2123000	2125000	It's my old damn fault not the knife company
2125000	2127000	Because they made their knives sharp
2127000	2129000	It's just
2129000	2131000	It's really dumb and I hope to god
2131000	2133000	That they have somebody out there
2133000	2135000	That sees this case and throws it out of court
2135000	2137000	You know but
2137000	2139000	Did they say this might go to jury trial
2139000	2141000	Or that's what they want? Is they want a jury trial out of this?
2141000	2143000	Well they were
2143000	2145000	I think the lawsuit was
2145000	2147000	On the Xbox 360 where they were seeking
2147000	2149000	Five million dollars for
2149000	2151000	They haven't really said a number
2151000	2153000	That they're looking to get yet
2153000	2155000	But I mean from what we've seen so far
2155000	2157000	The Wii straps breaking has been
2157000	2159000	Relatively rare
2159000	2161000	I mean it's happened
2161000	2163000	But you know people post it on the internet
2163000	2165000	And so it seems like a bigger problem than it actually is
2165000	2167000	And a lot of these
2167000	2169000	We found out as of last week
2169000	2171000	That are faked
2171000	2173000	So I mean
2173000	2175000	I just see this as just them trying to prop it up
2175000	2177000	Let's take the fakers to court
2177000	2179000	Nintendo ought to sue all the fakers
2179000	2181000	That would be funny
2181000	2183000	Well that does make sense
2183000	2185000	Technically it's perjury
2185000	2187000	There you go
2187000	2189000	I say if Nintendo loses money on this
2189000	2191000	They take those fakers to court
2191000	2193000	That would be funny
2193000	2195000	Defamation
2195000	2197000	Defamation suit
2197000	2199000	I think that would be funny
2199000	2201000	Now real quickly I want to say though
2201000	2203000	Did you hear about like that trillion dollar lawsuit
2203000	2205000	That the RIAA
2205000	2207000	Filed against that Russian MP3
2207000	2209000	Company that was selling all of
2209000	2211000	MP3.com or whatever that site is
2211000	2213000	Did you hear about that?
2213000	2215000	It's like one of the biggest lawsuits ever
2215000	2217000	Trillions of dollars
2217000	2219000	Like 1.6 trillion dollar lawsuit or something like that
2219000	2221000	There was another study I read
2221000	2223000	I don't even remember exactly what it was
2223000	2225000	But it was something that they were saying
2225000	2227000	That these claims, the damages that are being caused
2227000	2229000	By the downloads are a lot
2229000	2231000	That these companies are seeking for
2231000	2233000	And that
2233000	2235000	Really the
2235000	2237000	People downloading these MP3's are not really
2237000	2239000	Causing that much damage to them
2239000	2241000	All this news about lawsuits
2241000	2243000	I don't know about you guys but news about stupid
2243000	2245000	Lawsuits makes me very angry
2245000	2247000	Does it make you angry?
2247000	2249000	Everything makes me angry
2249000	2251000	You know what happens when we get angry?
2251000	2259000	Music
2259000	2261000	The F you's of the week time
2261000	2263000	DarkSakura what's pissing you off this week
2263000	2265000	F you to mucus
2265000	2267000	And the extreme amounts of it that live in my lungs
2267000	2269000	And make me sick every morning
2269000	2271000	I hate bronchitis
2271000	2273000	I hate it
2273000	2275000	I hate it
2275000	2279000	I hate it
2279000	2281000	Remember Kefka? Oh, forget it.
2281000	2283000	Yes. Yes, I remember.
2283000	2293000	But, um, I'd also like to just offer an F.U. to a tower video for not having any Dr. Who DVDs before they, uh, went on business.
2294000	2295000	Loki?
2295000	2299000	I'm pissed off at the lack of Wii games that are out there that- good Wii games.
2299000	2308000	Because, you know, I'm really s- I'm kinda searching for some more stuff to play, and I bought a lot of stuff, and I have to say about, you know, 60% of it's been crap.
2308000	2314000	And it's just- it's not because, you know, I picked a crappy game, it's just-
2314000	2318000	Haven't you played damn near every launch title now, except, like, Happy Feet and Avatar?
2318000	2325000	Well, I haven't played, like, any of the, you know, Happy Feet, Avatar, SpongeBob, you know, that stuff that's ports off of old games like Ant Bully and stuff.
2325000	2331000	But I've played, you know, quite a bit of everything, and it's- a lot of it's really crappy, and I'm-
2331000	2349000	I'm starting to get a little afraid that, you know, maybe this launch for the Wii wasn't as good as everyone's saying it was, because a lot of the games are really shitty, whereas, you know, even like the 360 launch, a lot of the games, you know, I didn't like, like Perfect Dark Zero was pretty shitty, I thought, but it was a lot better than this stuff.
2349000	2358000	But, I mean, look, to be fair, the games that were good on Wii were really good, like, you know, Zelda, and I thought Excite Truck was pretty damn good, especially for a launch title.
2358000	2362000	Trauma Center, fucking amazing, especially if you haven't played the DS one.
2362000	2369000	Here's the thing it's coming down to, is because Excite Truck is really good, it's like, yeah, that's awesome, I want to find another game like this.
2369000	2374000	Oh wait, there isn't anything like this, and next month there's only going to be one game.
2374000	2375000	Elibits wasn't bad.
2375000	2377000	Oh, I like Elibits.
2377000	2378000	WarioWare's going to be pretty good.
2378000	2396000	WarioWare's going to be really fun, but afterwards, what was there coming out afterwards, in February we've got like two games coming out, it's a big drought, despite what Reggie may say, there will be no drought in games or whatever, there is a drought in games, and it's like three games coming out in the next two months.
2396000	2398000	I'm sorry, they need more than this.
2398000	2402000	Don't you expect that there's going to be a drought in January, February, for every system?
2402000	2404000	What do the other systems have coming?
2404000	2420000	The other systems, 360's got Lost Planet, which is a pretty large title, well, Battle Stations Midway, which is shit, and Fusion Frenzy, and then Playstation 3 doesn't have shit coming out for it, but Playstation 3 doesn't have shit coming out for it at launch either.
2420000	2431000	And then Playstation 2, I mean, January, granted, is a slow month, but February does have a lot of stuff coming out for other systems, a lot of big titles, and the Wii's just kind of being skipped.
2431000	2433000	Alright.
2433000	2458000	My FUs of the week, I don't really have a lot, so FU2 cookies for being so tempting and straying me from my diet this holiday season, because I've gotten so many yummy cookies, like, you know, Loki and Nellie made me some for Christmas that were very good, no offense, I mean, the cookies were great, it's just too tempting, and then some of my students at work made me cookies, and, oh gosh, it's too much, too much to handle.
2458000	2475000	Let's get back into some news, and it's funny that you brought this up, but, you know, it was talked about this week, the whole delays for Wii games, there was some news going on that Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime could possibly be delayed all the way to Christmas,
2475000	2491000	but then, of course, Reggie Fils-Aime discussed with Newsweek, not that long ago, he made a promise Nintendo would not have the launch problems they have with usual consoles, quote, Metroid Prime 3, which is a from-the-ground-up creation of Metroid for the Wii system, will come out in early 2007.
2491000	2506000	This gives us fantastic momentum coming off the launch, and will certainly be an example of how there will be no new game drought for this system. Another from-the-ground-up Wii game that we are strategically timing to launch to make sure we are continuing driving momentum through 2007 is Super Mario Galaxy.
2506000	2525000	You know, and they really are doing a good job keeping games coming out, Nintendo is, you know, because they've got WarioWare for January, Wii Play for February, Mario Party 8 for March, I mean, and that's already, you know, the first quarter of the year, and they've got a game coming out every month.
2525000	2527000	Can't say the same for other companies, though, because...
2527000	2531000	So it's the third parties that have to pick it up, but is it still kind of new, maybe?
2531000	2537000	Maybe, well, and third parties have their development cycles, you know, March you're going to see a ton of games come out.
2537000	2541000	And remember how Nintendo wasn't letting a lot of them online at first?
2541000	2542000	That's stupid.
2542000	2543000	That could be part of it, too.
2543000	2557000	Nintendo needs to fucking get a clue, online's where it is now, and you know what, people were really excited about the online for the DS, and I thought, okay, because they saw that, let's take that as an example as, get this fucking console online.
2557000	2563000	This Mii Channel, you know, exchanging Miis and exchanging messages shit is, it's old.
2563000	2568000	It's old already, and we need, you know, some more online games.
2568000	2570000	It needs some actual good support for the online.
2570000	2580000	I also want to mention that it was previously said by Reggie as well that virtual console games may pick up the slack a little bit between the big, big support of the first parties,
2580000	2591000	that that's when they'll release some of the big stuff people want on virtual console, such as, I'm sure, Kid Icarus, Metroid at some point, you know, Super Mario World on Super Nintendo.
2591000	2595000	Those types of games will be strategically planned for when there's a drought of big Wii games.
2595000	2597000	Great, you know what you need to do with those virtual console games?
2597000	2601000	You need to put them online, like they do with Xbox Live Arcade games.
2601000	2603000	Put them so that you can play multiplayer online.
2603000	2610000	Maybe not exactly as how they're doing it because the Xbox Live Arcade games have had a little bit of problems with some of the online components of them,
2610000	2615000	but multiplayer online with Mario Kart, I mean, that's going to be awesome.
2615000	2619000	Of course, they probably wouldn't want to compete with their new Mario Kart whenever the fuck that's coming out, but...
2619000	2627000	Evie, you could really add a lot of oomph to some of these old crap titles, like baseball, tennis, Mario Brothers.
2627000	2628000	Well, I shouldn't say it's crap.
2628000	2630000	I mean, they all contributed to history, but now...
2630000	2631000	League of Pores at least.
2631000	2639000	Yeah, you could really add a lot of oomph to these games and really justify the $5 price with these little enhancements, I think.
2639000	2642000	It's not asking that much, I mean, I don't know.
2642000	2649000	Well, you know, I'm sure there's a huge technical aspect when it comes to lag and all that stuff, but, you know, whatever.
2649000	2654000	Well, excuse me for a moment while my voice fills me.
2654000	2661000	There are a few rumors floating about, and one that I know a lot of people would really, really like to see.
2661000	2673000	There are talks actually from EGM on the January issue stating that Katamari Damacy would be coming out on the Wii and Xbox Live Arcade.
2673000	2678000	I'm sort of not sure how it would work, you know, on the Wii, if you'd do it like Monkey Ball.
2678000	2679000	Probably like Monkey Ball.
2679000	2686000	Yeah, but Xbox Live, though, it would definitely, it's a good idea, I think, for Xbox Live.
2686000	2689000	I'm worried about the size limitation on Xbox Live, though, with 50 megs.
2689000	2691000	Well, I guess the graphics ain't all that.
2691000	2692000	What's that?
2692000	2693000	I don't know, okay.
2693000	2699000	I loaded my copy onto my HD loader, and it wasn't that big.
2699000	2701000	I'd have to check it again, but it wasn't.
2701000	2707000	Well, I'm hearing the rumors that they're going to up the live limit because the new memory card's coming out, the 256 megs.
2707000	2715000	I think the 50 meg limit's stupid anyways, and to be honest, so you can't download a live arcade game to your memory card.
2715000	2717000	Boo-fucking-who?
2717000	2719000	Who cares? Get a goddamn hard drive.
2719000	2720000	Or don't use that part of it.
2720000	2724000	Just use your fucking memory card for saves, and that is it.
2724000	2726000	We don't even do that. We just use a hard drive.
2726000	2731000	Yeah, the only thing I use memory cards for, downloading content from kiosks, and I don't even do that anymore.
2731000	2733000	Didn't we heart Katamari have a two-player mode?
2733000	2734000	It did, didn't it?
2734000	2736000	Yeah, so could you imagine having that on Xbox?
2736000	2738000	Well, the original one did too.
2738000	2739000	The original one did too.
2739000	2740000	That's right.
2740000	2744000	It was kind of a... I like co-op mode better for Katamari.
2744000	2753000	It wasn't like, you know, it's no Halo, Gears of War-style multiplayer that keeps people coming back, but it's a nice addition.
2753000	2756000	You know, makes it a little something special.
2756000	2758000	That would be kind of fun on Xbox Live.
2758000	2759000	I would love to see, you know...
2759000	2762000	I'd much rather play Katamari Damacy co-op than Gears of War, I'm sorry.
2762000	2768000	I'd love to see the Wii version have your Miis as, like, the little, you know, characters running around in the levels and stuff.
2768000	2769000	That'd be funny.
2769000	2770000	Oh, getting to roll over your friends?
2770000	2771000	Yeah.
2771000	2772000	That'd be fun.
2772000	2773000	Dude, that would be really cool.
2773000	2775000	Or they should do, like, as a...
2775000	2777000	Are the massive people in your Mii parade?
2777000	2778000	Yeah.
2778000	2785000	Or they should do, like, a convert a Mii, an existing Mii into a little prince cousin.
2785000	2786000	Little prince face? Maybe.
2786000	2788000	That'd be fun.
2788000	2794000	I think that would be good. They have a lot of things that they can do with that, and hopefully they'll actually use all that.
2794000	2796000	And of course, Loki will be all about the achievements.
2796000	2798000	Fuck that shit.
2798000	2800000	Yes, it will be all about the achievements.
2800000	2802000	No, but anyways.
2802000	2814000	Speaking of the 360, the 360 owner's got a pretty cool surprise recently, as Microsoft has upped their warranty from 90 days to one whole year.
2814000	2822000	So if your console happens to be broken, or if it was broken, you're going to be getting a refund for your broken console.
2822000	2824000	So that is pretty awesome.
2824000	2831000	And definitely, you know, at least they're supporting their hardware with the issues that they may have for it.
2831000	2833000	So, go Microsoft.
2833000	2834000	Hooray for them.
2834000	2839000	Alright, hooray for this, too, because obviously I'm a big fan of Luminous, as you guys know.
2839000	2844000	And there's a song in Luminous 2 that is just awesome, and it's a song called Heavenly Star.
2844000	2856000	Let me play a little bit of a clip of this song.
2856000	2862000	Well, this song, of course, is in Luminous 2 on the PSP, and it was just released for download on iTunes this week.
2862000	2866000	So you can check that out by the Genki Rockets, a song that's called Heavenly Star.
2866000	2875000	Well, this song, of course, since Mizuguchi had a part to do with this song, I believe he co-wrote it, it's going to be also making its way to Xbox Live Arcade.
2875000	2880000	It's going to be in the Heavenly Star pack that's supposed to come out in January 2007.
2880000	2885000	Now, we were also supposed to be getting the Artist pack in January of 2007, so we'll see what happens with that.
2885000	2889000	Now, Q Entertainment hasn't said what the price for the Heavenly Star pack is going to be,
2889000	2896000	but I would think that, you know, I would think that it would only cost, like, a dollar or something cheap.
2896000	2900000	If it's just the one skin, I don't know if they're going to do remixes or what,
2900000	2905000	but I would think it would be a nice thing to give away for free if it's just going to be one skin, right?
2905000	2906000	And it's such a great song.
2906000	2908000	I hear it's going to be about a buck to download.
2908000	2909000	That's not bad.
2909000	2914000	I guess that's not bad, considering that's what the song costs to download, and it is a great song, and it's fun to play, too.
2914000	2916000	So, we'll see what happens with that.
2916000	2921000	I really like this song, ever since the video was posted back in the day.
2921000	2922000	Yeah, it's a good song.
2922000	2927000	It's fun to play Luminous 2, but, you know, again, you don't want to rely on one song to push your game,
2927000	2932000	so, you know, I would hope that they supplement this with some other, you know, artist skins that come out.
2932000	2938000	Because, surprisingly, some of those songs in Luminous 2 weren't bad to play to, and even, I have to admit,
2938000	2940000	even, like, Hall of Batgirl is kind of funny.
2940000	2945000	I mean, just to have that playing in Luminous, I know we all hate Gwen Stefani, but, you know, it's kind of fun.
2945000	2950000	And, you know, the Black Eyed Peas pump it song, and Missy Elliott lose control.
2950000	2952000	That's a great one to play Luminous 2.
2952000	2953000	I'm sorry.
2953000	2954000	They got some fun.
2954000	2955000	They had some pretty fun choices.
2955000	2957000	For the benefit of our listeners, I'm staring blankly at Rob.
2957000	2958000	Whatever.
2958000	2959000	Then go to the next story.
2959000	2961000	Because I don't listen to any of that.
2961000	2962000	Go to the next story.
2962000	2967000	Well, you know how we were saying that Metal Gear, not just we, I mean, a bunch of people were saying
2967000	2969000	Metal Gear Solid 4 was going to be multi-platform?
2969000	2971000	It was a rumor last week.
2971000	2972000	Yeah, it was a rumor.
2972000	2980000	Well, an inside source at Konami is not really that reliable.
2980000	2987000	It's been, they've come out saying that it's going to be definitely exclusive for PS3.
2987000	2992000	At this time is the key word, or words, I should say.
2992000	2994000	So they let themselves in and out?
2994000	2995000	It's at this time.
2995000	2998000	It's just like they said, you know, what was it?
2998000	3006000	Well, one I pointed out when they brought their version of the story that Splinter Cell was coming out on the PS3 as well.
3006000	3011000	And they said, oh, we had no plans of this coming out on the PlayStation 3 at this time.
3011000	3015000	And then next week they announced, oh, it's coming out on the PlayStation 3.
3015000	3016000	Oh, no, it wasn't that.
3016000	3019000	It was Virtual Fighter V.
3019000	3020000	That's what it was.
3020000	3024000	They were doing an interview for that, and that was a PlayStation 3 exclusive.
3024000	3026000	And then this week, you know, 360.
3026000	3028000	I'm going to say something uncharacteristic for me.
3028000	3032000	I don't really think any other system can do the game justice but PS3.
3032000	3034000	Interesting. What makes you say that?
3034000	3036000	Playing Resistance Fall of Man.
3036000	3040000	You don't think they could do it on 360? What is it?
3040000	3042000	They could do it, but it would not do it justice.
3042000	3049000	With everything that I've seen that they want to do with Metal Gear Solid 4, they're going to need the extra processing power.
3049000	3051000	They're really going to need it.
3051000	3057000	Because I've played a bunch of stuff on Xbox 360, and it all comes out really pretty.
3057000	3064000	But I honestly, just doing comparisons for several of the games, I think the PS3 is going to be the better platform for the game anyway.
3064000	3067000	I guarantee you this will be out on the 360.
3067000	3071000	Not day and date, but it will be out on the 360.
3071000	3073000	I'm going to have it on PS3. It doesn't matter.
3073000	3075000	Interesting.
3075000	3079000	I never really got into Metal Gear past the old NES ones.
3079000	3082000	I don't know. I somehow missed that boat, and I know I'm weird for missing it.
3082000	3084000	Rob, do you believe that love can bloom on a battlefield?
3084000	3085000	Shut up.
3085000	3088000	They basically, it's all about money. That's what it is.
3088000	3094000	If the PlayStation 3 has 200,000 units out there, or say, okay, by the end of...
3094000	3097000	What if the PS3 suddenly takes off between this and Final Fantasy 13?
3097000	3103000	That's exactly it. If the PlayStation 3 takes off between now and whenever, then yeah.
3103000	3105000	Then it probably will be exclusive to PlayStation 3.
3105000	3112000	But, right now, since the 360 has a jump on them by millions of units, it's coming out on the 360.
3112000	3118000	They would be dumb to just say, oh, you know, we don't like money, so we're just not going to make it for the 360.
3118000	3125000	It can be made on the 360 as all these other PlayStation 3 games, and it will be made on the 360.
3125000	3132000	Just because they're exclusive right now, Sony does pay them for exclusive rights to some of these games.
3132000	3135000	And so, after a certain amount of time.
3135000	3141000	But the Xbox 360 does not have 6-axis.
3141000	3147000	Yeah, and the PlayStation 3 doesn't have rumble.
3147000	3149000	Such flimsy controllers.
3149000	3154000	Anyways, so, you know, great.
3154000	3162000	And speaking of the PlayStation 3, Sony's actually in talks with Amazon for their movie download service.
3162000	3168000	And, you know, because PlayStation 3, they're starting to kind of get into the more downloads and everything.
3168000	3172000	And I've got to admit, they do have some pretty good stuff on their network service right now,
3172000	3176000	as far as the equivalents to live arcade games.
3176000	3181000	Especially, they're getting that Gran Turismo HD demo, which is not bad for free.
3181000	3183000	I've got to admit, that's pretty cool.
3183000	3188000	And, you know, now they're talking about going the same way as the 360 and offering movie downloads.
3188000	3193000	Which, this isn't a big surprise, you know, because it's Sony and they want it to be this media center type thing.
3193000	3199000	So, of course, they're talking with Amazon because they have their digital download service as well.
3199000	3203000	And probably, you know, going to hook up with them on that.
3203000	3205000	But I see this probably happening.
3205000	3209000	Especially with the PSP, I think they have their download service as well.
3209000	3212000	So, what does this mean for UMDs?
3212000	3214000	This doesn't mean anything for UMDs.
3214000	3217000	It means that people are going to be downloading videos to the PlayStation 3.
3217000	3220000	UMDs, you know, are going to be like UMDs.
3220000	3223000	Meaning they're going to be out there, but they're not going to sell.
3223000	3227000	Is this to compete with 360's new little marketplace movie thingy?
3227000	3228000	Definitely.
3228000	3230000	Which I still don't like, because they don't have enough HD movies.
3230000	3233000	They have like five, literally. I count five or six HD movies, that's it.
3233000	3236000	It's literally, it's going to be to compete with that.
3236000	3239000	And it's also going to be to compete with iTunes.
3239000	3241000	That's exactly what it's for.
3241000	3242000	Alright.
3242000	3245000	Well, something else to be competitive in the movie world.
3245000	3250000	Ken Kutaragi has spoken with Impress, that's a magazine over in Japan,
3250000	3253000	about an AV-centric PlayStation 3.
3253000	3256000	This would have the cell processor powering,
3256000	3259000	and would, quote, be a standard AV component-sized box
3259000	3263000	with a more powerful power supply unit, anti-shake insulator,
3263000	3265000	and twice the main memory.
3265000	3269000	And then it also goes on to talk about dual HDMI output for this high-end system.
3269000	3272000	Now, this is kind of similar to the PSX,
3272000	3275000	which was a version of the PlayStation 2,
3275000	3277000	but it was just very expensive.
3277000	3279000	I guess you could kind of compare it to, you know,
3279000	3282000	like the Panasonic Q was like an AV machine,
3282000	3283000	but it also played GameCube games.
3283000	3287000	So it's not necessarily that he's talking about replacing the PlayStation 3 already.
3287000	3290000	But to me, it does seem a little early to be talking about this.
3290000	3291000	To me.
3291000	3293000	And it's also the dual-
3293000	3295000	It's like, make your PlayStation 3s.
3295000	3298000	Well, the dual HDMI out, that was originally what they were talking about.
3298000	3299000	I remember that.
3299000	3300000	For the original PlayStation 3.
3300000	3301000	Yeah.
3301000	3303000	Then, you know, apparently that was a little crazy,
3303000	3305000	and also the same with-
3305000	3308000	Well, actually, I remember the dual HDMI out for the PlayStation 3
3308000	3310000	was for multiple monitors.
3310000	3312000	Remember, they said that if you had two HDTVs,
3312000	3314000	who would have this?
3314000	3317000	Sitting next to each other, you could extend your, you know,
3317000	3320000	desktop to be on both of them for-
3320000	3322000	I don't know what reason you would need that,
3322000	3325000	and who the hell would have two giant 50-inch, you know,
3325000	3327000	HDTVs next to each other?
3327000	3328000	Whatever.
3328000	3330000	But that was one of the things that they were talking about.
3330000	3333000	And now the price tag on this, I think what they were saying, $2,500?
3333000	3335000	Who the fuck's gonna pay that?
3335000	3336000	I mean, seriously.
3336000	3339000	The $600 is too expensive to sell PlayStation 3s.
3339000	3341000	Who the hell's gonna pay $2,500 for this?
3341000	3344000	Because, I mean, just because it has DVR and stuff,
3344000	3348000	you can build your own, you know, DVR system, high-end,
3348000	3352000	and buy a PlayStation 3 and still do it cheaper than this.
3352000	3354000	It's just stupid.
3354000	3357000	And the other thing, too, they're saying normal component size.
3357000	3361000	Well, that PlayStation 3 is not small by any means.
3361000	3364000	It is already normal component size, if not larger.
3364000	3369000	I mean, so what's the size of this power brick thing gonna be?
3369000	3372000	I mean, is it gonna be the size of, like, a TV or something?
3372000	3375000	I mean, seriously, what are they talking about for this stuff?
3375000	3377000	I think this is still a ways out, whatever it is.
3377000	3380000	I think they need to shut him up, is what they need to do,
3380000	3384000	because he is just spouting off retardedness as time goes on.
3384000	3388000	He really, he doesn't have a grip on reality.
3388000	3391000	All right, well, we issued a challenge to our listeners last week.
3391000	3394000	If you think the Sony spokespeople have no clue what they're doing
3394000	3397000	in the marketing department, create your own Sony ad.
3397000	3400000	And we invited folks to leave us a voicemail on our Skype line,
3400000	3405000	1-877-GAME-OLR, with their best Sony advertisement.
3405000	3407000	And we're proud to say we have a winner.
3407000	3409000	First off, we want to thank everybody that called in
3409000	3410000	and took the time to enter the contest.
3410000	3413000	It sounds like some people really, like, rode out, you know,
3413000	3417000	creative things to say, and you gave us a lot of laughs.
3417000	3419000	So thanks to all you guys for entering.
3419000	3421000	We want to play for you guys now, the winner.
3423000	3427000	Hi, I'm Sony's new spokesperson, Paradox Vincent.
3427000	3430000	Now, look, the PS3 has been getting a lot of rap,
3430000	3434000	but I think that it's really just on this communication, you know?
3434000	3438000	You gamer people just don't understand the way the business works.
3438000	3441000	So I'm here to clear some things up.
3441000	3444000	The biggest complaint we've heard is the price.
3444000	3448000	Too cheap, I know, but there's nothing we can do about that now.
3448000	3451000	Secondly, some people say it freezes.
3451000	3455000	We're putting freezing technology in so that people can really get a feel
3455000	3460000	for the true next generation look and feel on your 1080i television.
3460000	3465000	To really feel like you're driving that car and you're shooting that alien.
3465000	3468000	Or how you're in that giant robot.
3468000	3470000	We want you to feel like you're a ninja or whatever,
3470000	3473000	stabbing the giant enemy crab.
3473000	3474000	We get it, you know?
3474000	3478000	We understand that some people might not have HDTV.
3478000	3484000	In fact, a great number of people don't have HDTV,
3484000	3487000	especially not 1080i HDTV.
3487000	3488000	Well, we don't care.
3488000	3489000	Leave us alone.
3489000	3493000	I'm not hearing you, la la, la la la la la.
3493000	3496000	La la, you're stupid.
3496000	3500000	All in all, it's the perfect gaming console, I know.
3500000	3505000	The Wii's a pedophile and the Xbox 360 takes pictures of you while you're sleeping.
3505000	3511000	Would you pay $600 for a pedophile or a pervert or a terrorist?
3511000	3512000	I wouldn't.
3512000	3514000	Make the right move.
3514000	3517000	Make the Sony move.
3517000	3521000	Congratulations to Paradox Vincent for winning our little contest there.
3521000	3527000	I think my favorite part of that is you wouldn't pay $600 to a pedophile or a terrorist.
3527000	3530000	My favorite was la la la la la la.
3530000	3531000	So good job, Paradox Vincent.
3531000	3534000	We're going to send you some random things from our OLR prize pool.
3534000	3537000	I know we have a DDR Extreme 2 bundle.
3537000	3538000	Yes, that's Extreme 2.
3538000	3542000	That's last year's game, but hey, those DDR pads are not easy to come by.
3542000	3545000	So you get a bundle there and some other stuff as well.
3545000	3547000	I think there's a DS game we have to give away too.
3547000	3550000	Don't we have a copy of Tao or something that's got to get given away at some point?
3550000	3551000	I don't know.
3551000	3552000	You'll see.
3552000	3554000	You'll find out what you get when you get it.
3554000	3555000	All right.
3555000	3557000	What a great contest.
3557000	3559000	You get to win something.
3559000	3561000	A thing, a random.
3561000	3563000	Think of it as Santa Claus coming to your house.
3563000	3564000	Something's better than nothing.
3564000	3566000	Something random from Orange Lounge Radio.
3566000	3567000	We'll be in touch.
3567000	3569000	You win stuff here.
3569000	3571000	More contests to come.
3571000	3574000	We'll probably do something next week, so stay tuned to Orange Lounge Radio.
3574000	3577000	Well, I have some news, and this makes me happy.
3577000	3579000	Remember Loco Roco?
3579000	3580000	Why, yes, I do.
3580000	3582000	Is getting a sequel.
3582000	3584000	That's kind of a given.
3584000	3588000	You mean one of the only PSP games people talked about a lot this year?
3588000	3589000	Getting a sequel?
3589000	3590000	No way!
3590000	3594000	Well, it was announced by Phil Harrison to MTV News.
3594000	3599000	Now, this makes me think, though, that quite possibly, I don't know,
3599000	3602000	given that Loco Roco sort of flopped in Japan,
3602000	3606000	I'm wondering if they're going to have a more limited release there than they will here.
3606000	3607000	I can just hear that.
3607000	3608000	I can see the interview now.
3608000	3610000	Yeah, we're doing a sequel to Loco Roco.
3610000	3613000	I don't like any of those Mexican games.
3613000	3615000	What?
3615000	3618000	Because Loco, you know, Loco Roco.
3618000	3620000	Loco Roco is great.
3620000	3622000	Anyways, whatever.
3622000	3625000	I rolled my eyes, too, when she said they went on MTV to announce the sequel,
3625000	3627000	but I don't get where you're going with this.
3627000	3628000	This also looks very...
3628000	3629000	MTV's stupid.
3629000	3633000	This picture looks like...
3633000	3634000	A penis?
3634000	3636000	Yeah, it does a little bit.
3636000	3638000	Jamie sees a penis in everything.
3638000	3640000	I do not.
3640000	3643000	I bet you wish you were in Second Life this week.
3643000	3644000	I know we didn't get around to that story,
3644000	3647000	but there was some chick that was being interviewed in Second Life,
3647000	3653000	and all these penises flew by on the screen like people threw dicks at her.
3653000	3655000	And I was thinking, Jamie should see this.
3655000	3657000	I actually tried downloading Second Life,
3657000	3661000	and this is what, again, it was my fandom that inspired me.
3661000	3664000	Someone freaking made a TARDIS on Second Life.
3664000	3665000	You nerd.
3665000	3669000	Well, it's not fully extra-dimensional like the actual one,
3669000	3672000	but they had it all laid out, and they had the current one,
3672000	3675000	and then they had the Tom Baker era one in the different rooms and stuff.
3675000	3676000	I thought that was cool.
3676000	3680000	And then I played Second Life for like five minutes,
3680000	3683000	and then I was like, this game sucks.
3683000	3686000	Anyways...
3686000	3688000	Yeah, Second Life, I don't get it.
3688000	3691000	But anyways...
3691000	3692000	New Kingdom Hearts?
3692000	3694000	Speaking of Jamie fandom...
3694000	3697000	Yay!
3697000	3700000	Yeah, I'm sure this is news to everybody.
3700000	3704000	They're making another Kingdom Hearts game that's a shocker.
3704000	3707000	Shocker! Why?
3707000	3709000	Why would they do something like this?
3709000	3711000	It's not like the last game sold millions or anything.
3711000	3713000	So yeah, they're making a new Kingdom Hearts game,
3713000	3715000	Kingdom Hearts 3,
3715000	3719000	and of course this was sort of announced on the trailer
3719000	3726000	that they had for Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix during their Jump Festa show in Tokyo.
3726000	3727000	Yay!
3727000	3730000	And basically saying that a new project was in the works.
3730000	3734000	So, Kingdom Hearts 3, something brand new to the series.
3734000	3737000	Well, something Kingdom Hearts-ish is coming.
3737000	3739000	Yay!
3739000	3741000	Yay, they better have space paranoid in it.
3741000	3746000	And I'm here to announce something else that Square's going to be doing.
3746000	3748000	I know this is going to be a shock to everyone.
3748000	3752000	After Final Fantasy XIII, there will be a Final Fantasy XIV.
3752000	3753000	Oh my god!
3753000	3755000	It's coming soon.
3755000	3756000	Oh my god.
3756000	3760000	Eloki breaks the world exclusive on Final Fantasy XIV.
3760000	3761000	Amazing.
3761000	3764000	I speculate there will be five versions of it.
3764000	3767000	I am actually thinking, let me think,
3767000	3774000	there will be another Final Fantasy game re-released on some handheld in the near future.
3774000	3777000	There will be some type of re-release of some game from Square.
3777000	3781000	And there's going to be another Final Fantasy VII side story.
3781000	3784000	After Super Mario Galaxy, there will be another Mario game.
3784000	3785000	Amazing.
3785000	3786000	And there will be another Zelda game.
3786000	3788000	Well, we actually already know about the Zelda game.
3788000	3791000	But there will be a Metroid IV in some capacity.
3791000	3793000	There will be another Metroid game as well.
3793000	3797000	And then they will also re-release a remade version of the old Metroid.
3797000	3799000	And despite what the rumors say,
3799000	3802000	if you think they're not going to make a Halo 4 or some type of Halo story,
3802000	3803000	you're kidding yourself.
3803000	3808000	All right, anyway, speaking of games that are going to be kind of expensive,
3808000	3810000	as all those games are going to be,
3810000	3813000	there was an interesting story run by Forbes this week
3813000	3816000	that breaks down the price of a $60 video game.
3816000	3819000	Of course, a lot of people are bitching and moaning because games are $60 now.
3819000	3820000	I don't know if you've heard.
3820000	3823000	But games are kind of expensive in this day and age.
3823000	3825000	And this is where your money goes.
3825000	3829000	$27 goes towards the making of the game.
3829000	3832000	$15 goes towards art and graphics.
3832000	3836000	$12 goes towards gameplay mechanics.
3836000	3839000	Now, $12 goes to the retail markup,
3839000	3842000	meaning that the store you actually buy it from gets $12
3842000	3845000	because it usually costs them about $48.
3845000	3849000	And there's a console owner fee of $7.
3849000	3852000	And the retail and publishing parties involved
3852000	3855000	only really get about $1 for every game sold.
3855000	3858000	They might be able to push it to $3 a game
3858000	3863000	if they sell advertising in the manual or do some of that in-game advertising stuff
3863000	3866000	or what have you.
3866000	3868000	Interesting.
3868000	3870000	That's where your money goes, if you ever wondered.
3870000	3871000	That's economics for you.
3871000	3875000	Well, if you ever wonder where your emails go when you send them to Mailbag
3875000	3877000	at orangeloungeradio.com,
3877000	3880000	they go to the bowels of hell known as Jamie's House,
3880000	3883000	where she opens them up and reads them
3883000	3886000	and finds some of her favorites to read for you all on air.
3886000	3888000	So do you have some mail for us this week, DarkSakura?
3888000	3895000	Yes.
3895000	3897000	Damn you people, only five this week.
3897000	3898000	What's up with that?
3898000	3900000	I expect better of our listeners.
3900000	3903000	I heard there was a holiday or something going on.
3903000	3905000	So?
3905000	3906000	It doesn't take long to type.
3906000	3909000	I type 90 words a minute.
3909000	3912000	I have a letter typed up in, you know, three minutes.
3912000	3913000	Anyway.
3913000	3916000	Nah, but we got some pretty good emails.
3916000	3920000	The first one comes from, I guess it's pronounced Igor.
3920000	3924000	This is Igor, regular listener from Florianopolis, Brazil.
3924000	3925000	That's cool.
3925000	3928000	I've been listening to you for quite some time
3928000	3930000	and I consider it a very good podcast.
3930000	3932000	Top five on my iTunes every week.
3932000	3936000	By the way, I believe that you should be experiencing some problems in iTunes.
3936000	3938000	Stupid thing popped up.
3938000	3940000	Sorry, I had my DVD pop up.
3940000	3943000	But I closed my case while it was reading so it covered email.
3943000	3945000	Anyway.
3945000	3946000	Okay.
3946000	3949000	It's not the first time this happened at least twice in the last month
3949000	3952000	because I downloaded part A and it's only eight minutes long.
3952000	3954000	Does anyone also have this issue?
3954000	3955000	Keep doing a great job.
3955000	3956000	Hope to see you guys down here in South America.
3956000	3958000	Sincerely, Igor.
3958000	3961000	I don't use iTunes, so I don't know.
3961000	3962000	I do.
3962000	3965000	I always check to make sure the podcast works okay on iTunes
3965000	3967000	and I've never been able to duplicate the issue.
3967000	3970000	But you're not the first person I've heard to complain about it.
3970000	3972000	Unfortunately, there's not a lot we can do on our end.
3972000	3976000	I'm not sure what iTunes is doing to cause it or if it's a server thing.
3976000	3978000	I think iTunes, if the download moves too slow,
3978000	3981000	and considering how much we get hammered when a new show goes out
3981000	3985000	because we're distributed on the X...
3985000	3986000	God, now I can't remember.
3986000	3987000	Xbox Live?
3987000	3988000	No, not Xbox Live.
3988000	3989000	The XB stream.
3989000	3990000	Thank you.
3990000	3992000	We're on that and that hits us every 15 minutes,
3992000	3995000	so a lot of people hit our show right when it comes out
3995000	3998000	and I think it might be causing the server to move a little bit slowly.
3998000	4000000	There are other subscription services you can use.
4000000	4003000	Yeah, there are other subscriptions you can use to get on the feed
4003000	4006000	or you can go to the feed directly
4006000	4009000	and just go to where it says download our podcast on the main site.
4009000	4013000	You can actually pull the MP3s directly from our page.
4013000	4017000	And there's also, you know, you can use Yahoo podcasts,
4017000	4019000	although they've fallen behind on the listing,
4019000	4021000	so I don't know how much I support that one right now.
4021000	4026000	And Dig, but they mirror the show on their site or something kind of funny,
4026000	4028000	so if you're not going to use iTunes,
4028000	4032000	I would suggest maybe like Pod Nova or the, what is that thing called?
4032000	4033000	Juice?
4033000	4036000	Or something like that that would pull down the MP3s as well
4036000	4038000	or go directly to the feed and save it from there.
4038000	4040000	When I get them, I go to the feed.
4040000	4042000	So I can tell you it's reliable.
4042000	4046000	Well, we have another one coming from Gorilla,
4046000	4048000	which is cool because I'm the fan.
4048000	4051000	Well, no, I see Gorilla and I instantly think Gorillas.
4051000	4053000	Hey, kids, long-time listener and fan of the show.
4053000	4055000	Just wanted to comment on some things said on past shows
4055000	4058000	in regards to eBaying Wii or PS3.
4058000	4061000	It's sort of a long one.
4061000	4064000	So forgive me if I paraphrase a little bit.
4064000	4067000	I personally have no problem with someone selling their bought and owned device.
4067000	4070000	If I own a PS3 for two minutes or two years,
4070000	4072000	I own it and have a right to put it up on eBay,
4072000	4074000	sell it to my coworker or anyone else.
4074000	4075000	If someone thinks this is wrong,
4075000	4077000	then they should have been in line in front of me and got one,
4077000	4079000	and they could have done whatever they want with it.
4079000	4080000	It's not my business.
4080000	4086000	In my own defense, I did get a PS3 and I did wait in line for a Wii, so yeah.
4086000	4089000	I don't believe people should be getting anything the easy way.
4089000	4092000	I think everyone should work hard for what they have.
4092000	4094000	Or the game companies should make enough of it.
4094000	4096000	Yeah, there's that too.
4096000	4102000	I fully blame Sony and Greed for the state of that.
4102000	4105000	Excuse me.
4105000	4106000	This is going to be an email.
4106000	4109000	I'm going to post on our forums, because it is long.
4109000	4111000	But I'm going to read the last paragraph,
4111000	4115000	because it sort of mirrors a little bit how I feel about it.
4115000	4118000	I'm sure you will edit this if you read it on the show,
4118000	4120000	but the bottom line is this is my opinion.
4120000	4122000	If you own something, no matter how long,
4122000	4124000	especially if you put the time and effort to wait in line
4124000	4129000	with a bunch of people who you would never want to stand next to otherwise,
4129000	4132000	it is your right to self-smash, burn, throw out a window, or keep for years
4132000	4135000	before selling it back to GameStop anyway.
4135000	4140000	If people don't like it, then tell them when they see an auction for $3,000
4140000	4144000	on an already overpriced $600 device, don't bid.
4144000	4145000	I do agree with that.
4145000	4148000	Hold on, I thought you were staunchly against reselling these consoles on eBay.
4148000	4149000	No, no, no.
4149000	4152000	I'm going to say this very specifically.
4152000	4158000	I am against buying them out for the specific purpose of selling them.
4158000	4163000	For those people who bought 10 PS3s at 10 different stores in Japan
4163000	4168000	just for the purpose of selling them online, I have a problem with that.
4168000	4173000	I don't have a problem with someone, you know, and I did think about it.
4173000	4176000	I will admit when I can change my opinion about things
4176000	4178000	after putting lots of thought into it.
4178000	4180000	Say that this is your college tuition.
4180000	4183000	I don't have a problem with that.
4183000	4187000	I mean, if you take it home and say you, I actually don't have a problem
4187000	4191000	if you take it home, play this, if you know this is shit, and put it on eBay,
4191000	4194000	I don't have a problem with that at all.
4194000	4198000	Now, the one problem I have though with using it to make a profit for, say,
4198000	4202000	your bills or for your mortgage is that it's gambling.
4202000	4206000	I'm not a gambling person.
4206000	4209000	Even though, yeah, just about everyone who sold one on eBay
4209000	4211000	has gotten a lot of money for it, you never know if you're going to get,
4211000	4215000	you know, a bum deal on it or if it's not going to go through
4215000	4217000	and you've wasted $600.
4217000	4219000	I love me the slot machines once in a while.
4219000	4222000	I like to gamble, but yet I won't do this.
4222000	4226000	And it's, you know, I'm not so, you know, I guess if people are,
4226000	4230000	if eBay is going to let them do it, then, you know, they have the right to do it
4230000	4232000	as much as I may not like it or I may not want to do it myself.
4232000	4236000	But I do blame the buyer almost more than the seller.
4236000	4238000	I blame the buyer for making that demand.
4238000	4240000	Well, that's exactly the point.
4240000	4244000	It's all those people who are not willing to put any effort into anything.
4244000	4246000	See, okay.
4246000	4247000	It's stupidity.
4247000	4251000	If you're putting the effort into it and buying it, yeah, okay, you can sell it.
4251000	4255000	I still don't think it's right, but it is your right to do so.
4255000	4256000	I agree with that.
4256000	4259000	I don't think it's right for, again, those people who were basically
4259000	4263000	getting the edge on the market by buying 100 PS3s and selling them on eBay.
4263000	4264000	That's, yeah, that's much.
4264000	4265000	That's sick.
4265000	4266000	That's abuse.
4266000	4267000	That's sick.
4267000	4271000	But I think that, yeah, all those people, though, who are paying the money for them on eBay,
4271000	4272000	gouge them.
4272000	4274000	Make them pay.
4274000	4278000	You know, because they didn't stand in line and put any damn effort into it.
4278000	4281000	You know, those people deserve to get ripped off.
4281000	4285000	And if it's disposable income, then you know what?
4285000	4289000	They need to take those people away from, you know, their disposable income
4289000	4291000	and make them go work hard for something.
4291000	4296000	You know, I have a problem with that.
4296000	4301000	I think that people should actually have to work hard for what they have
4301000	4304000	instead of just having it handed to them on a platter.
4304000	4307000	Although I don't mind when anybody hands me anything on a platter,
4307000	4310000	but I also work hard for everything else I have.
4310000	4313000	It's a different story if you just get everything you want.
4313000	4315000	If you work hard, you should be able to get something.
4315000	4320000	But anyway, thanks and love the show for keeping up all the good work and reviews.
4320000	4322000	I did buy an Xbox 360 and am keeping it.
4322000	4324000	Oh, you're cool.
4324000	4326000	It's from Gorilla.
4326000	4328000	Post your game and tag on the forums.
4328000	4329000	Join the OL Army.
4329000	4330000	Email from Chicago.
4330000	4336000	Once in a while you should have a retro game segment and feature a past system
4336000	4340000	such as the 3DO game system, which I loved and still own.
4340000	4342000	Okay, you're entitled to that.
4342000	4343000	I was way ahead of you.
4343000	4345000	Yeah, you're allowed to love it if you really want to love that system.
4345000	4347000	Before PS1 came out and killed it.
4347000	4353000	You know, actually, you must have ESPN, I mean, ESP,
4353000	4356000	because look for something like that to be coming out next year.
4356000	4357000	All right.
4357000	4358000	There's more.
4358000	4359000	Right.
4359000	4362000	More emails from mailbag at orangeontrader.com.
4362000	4364000	I'm going to have Learn Giants by the time I'm done with this segment.
4364000	4365000	That's all right.
4365000	4367000	Hey, guys and girls, yes, Jamie, I wouldn't forget your angsty self.
4367000	4368000	Oh, thank you.
4368000	4373000	It's Nim, and yeah, it's been going good down here in Texas, I suppose.
4373000	4377000	The stars at night shine big and bright.
4377000	4378000	Ow.
4378000	4380000	I can't clap with the microphone in my hand.
4380000	4382000	Sorry, can't help it.
4382000	4383000	Pee-wee.
4383000	4385000	Just recently I had an idea for a game.
4385000	4388000	Now, don't you start spouting off, I smell a kamami lawsuit.
4388000	4390000	Konami will sue.
4390000	4391000	Hey.
4391000	4394000	But I was thinking of making a step mania type game for the arcade.
4394000	4397000	I have ideas and such, but right now nothing has been done,
4397000	4400000	and I'm trying to get the word out.
4400000	4403000	So you can say I love your show, and I know everybody else should.
4403000	4405000	Maybe I can find some help with this.
4405000	4409000	I'm not going to read out the email yet.
4409000	4411000	Enough of my shameless self-promoting or whatever.
4411000	4412000	Hold on.
4412000	4413000	If it's going to change subjects,
4413000	4415000	I want to talk about the step mania thing for just a minute.
4415000	4416000	Isn't that just in the groove?
4416000	4418000	I imagine this person must have some type of separate idea
4418000	4420000	that differentiates it from in the groove,
4420000	4422000	but it wasn't in the groove, just step mania in your case?
4422000	4423000	Yeah.
4423000	4426000	And, Loki, you actually had a step mania cabinet
4426000	4428000	that you helped build for a local arcade.
4428000	4429000	Tell us briefly, in a minute or so,
4429000	4431000	what was your experience with that?
4431000	4432000	It was a pain in the ass.
4432000	4433000	Why, what happened?
4433000	4436000	Just the computer...
4436000	4441000	Normal computers don't like normal arcade cabinet environments.
4441000	4443000	In other words, they get too damn hot.
4443000	4447000	At the time, I didn't have the right tools
4447000	4451000	to basically put an image on that type of a screen
4451000	4455000	because the arcade screens run at what they call CGA,
4455000	4458000	which is a very low resolution screen.
4458000	4463000	But, it looks nice in the arcade because it's a really old screen.
4463000	4465000	But, it's a pain in the ass.
4465000	4466000	Let me put it that way.
4466000	4469000	But now, within the grooves, arcade stuff,
4469000	4471000	since they just run a PC anyways,
4471000	4476000	you can actually buy a lot of this stuff from third party manufacturers
4476000	4480000	and be able to create your own step mania cabinet really easy now.
4480000	4483000	And, in fact, they actually built step mania builds
4483000	4485000	meant for arcade cabinets.
4485000	4488000	So, if you build a cool enough computer,
4488000	4489000	and it's also hard, too,
4489000	4491000	because you have to get the computer to turn on
4491000	4493000	with the actual cabinet stuff.
4493000	4495000	But, if you can rig that all up,
4495000	4498000	then, yeah, it's pretty easy to do once you've got the setup.
4498000	4500000	Alright.
4500000	4502000	To continue with the email.
4502000	4503000	Let me get to my main point.
4503000	4505000	I recently picked up a Nintendo DS
4505000	4507000	and was hoping to pick up a copy of Final Fantasy III for it
4507000	4509000	at the closest GameStop.
4509000	4512000	Now, well, I have a good reason to get all angsty about the franchise now,
4512000	4515000	seeing as how they didn't even have a copy in.
4515000	4517000	Before this, they sold me a defective 2DX game.
4517000	4520000	Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.
4520000	4521000	That sounds like me.
4521000	4524000	So, yeah, that's all I really have to say.
4524000	4528000	Still waiting to get a 360, or are we me being the poor bastard I am.
4528000	4530000	Um, you know what?
4530000	4532000	I suggest, um, I don't really think it's the GameStop
4532000	4535000	because they have the stock that they have at the time.
4535000	4536000	Use your phone.
4536000	4538000	Give them a call.
4538000	4541000	You know, I live close to three GameStops.
4541000	4544000	If I had been told by a GameStop rep previously,
4544000	4547000	I'm too busy to look, come down here.
4547000	4550000	And that's when I decided I wasn't going to support that particular store anymore.
4550000	4553000	I realized that was that store and not the chain as a whole,
4553000	4556000	but that's when I realized I wasn't ever going to go down there ever.
4556000	4559000	Then again, usually all I have to do is say, hey, this is Dan's wife.
4559000	4563000	Well, you know, I don't get on the phone and go,
4563000	4566000	I have a podcast on the internet, so you damn well better help me,
4566000	4567000	or I'm going to talk shit about you.
4567000	4569000	No, I just call like anyone else does, you know?
4569000	4571000	Well, I mean, usually what I do is I call,
4571000	4573000	and then if it's one of the managers I've met before,
4573000	4576000	then I'll say, hey, yeah, it's me.
4576000	4581000	But honestly, though, really, I've found a few people who are willing to look
4581000	4586000	and say, hey, I'm going to be coming by if you have this.
4586000	4589000	I'm going to be giving you money if you have this.
4589000	4592000	But I've been in a GameStop when it's busy,
4592000	4595000	and when they say they don't have time to look,
4595000	4597000	it means they don't have time to look.
4597000	4601000	That is the fault of not having enough employees to handle the issues then.
4601000	4602000	I'm sorry.
4602000	4605000	And having been sort of on the inside of it,
4605000	4607000	that is the fault of GameStop corporate.
4607000	4608000	Then there you go.
4608000	4610000	They do not want to give the hours they need to man the stores.
4610000	4613000	Well, it's hurting your business, folks.
4613000	4615000	I'm not going back to that store.
4615000	4616000	It's not the manager's fault.
4616000	4618000	I teach customer service for a living.
4618000	4620000	I get offended when people do that kind of stuff.
4620000	4622000	Well, I was in customer service for a while too,
4622000	4624000	and I know what I expect of myself.
4624000	4626000	Well, you know, what if they're too busy at that one time?
4626000	4629000	Then obviously they're too busy to ring me up at the register.
4629000	4632000	Can I put you on hold, you know,
4632000	4635000	and they could have one employee that's not necessarily working the register
4635000	4638000	because not everyone ever has to be working the register at the time.
4638000	4639000	They have one employee to check on that.
4639000	4642000	You know, can I put you on hold, you know, and...
4642000	4643000	They are supposed to put you on hold.
4643000	4644000	No.
4644000	4646000	And they are supposed to have you on hold as long as you're on hold.
4646000	4647000	I walked right over to the next...
4647000	4648000	You know what?
4648000	4650000	Instead, I walked right over to the next store Best Buy,
4650000	4652000	picked up my game, left, in and out, very easy,
4652000	4654000	and that's where I bought all my games for a little while.
4654000	4656000	Well, you know, and it's not really, I think,
4656000	4660000	so much the fault of the store managers
4660000	4662000	because having talked to a number of them,
4662000	4663000	they're all like, we need more hours.
4663000	4664000	We need more hours.
4664000	4665000	We need more hours.
4665000	4667000	And it's corporate that's not giving it to them, so blame them.
4667000	4670000	No, I don't know whose fault it is, but it sucks.
4670000	4671000	End of story.
4671000	4673000	Last one comes from Nekky.
4673000	4675000	I guess that's how it's pronounced.
4675000	4677000	Downloaded for the first time off iTunes
4677000	4679000	and it's great, nice community feel to it.
4679000	4682000	I'm from the UK, so can't do any of the live forums, et cetera.
4682000	4685000	Like to hear a few more stories about the UK.
4685000	4687000	I do our best.
4687000	4689000	I look when I can.
4689000	4691000	WePlay is already out in the UK.
4691000	4693000	In the last podcast, you said it wasn't out,
4693000	4695000	but maybe that's only in the US.
4695000	4697000	We probably were talking about the US
4697000	4699000	because we're not getting it until February,
4699000	4702000	and I know we had a big story on the delay of WePlay last week.
4702000	4705000	Whereas you guys, I think you are just now getting Wii Sports,
4705000	4707000	whereas we had it as a pack-in with our system,
4707000	4709000	so it was kind of interesting.
4709000	4711000	Anyway, looking forward to the next podcast.
4711000	4714000	Till next time, Nekky.
4714000	4719000	I'm really actually, I do try to look for UK specific stuff,
4719000	4722000	more like Europe in general.
4722000	4727000	I mean, honestly, I myself have a lot of love for the UK,
4727000	4729000	and I want to make sure that our folks are covered.
4729000	4731000	Keep in mind, a big part of it is, too,
4731000	4735000	is that a lot of stuff, and I don't mean to offend or worry,
4735000	4738000	but a lot of stuff comes up in Japan in the US first,
4738000	4740000	and then the UK just kind of gets it later.
4740000	4743000	Not to say that there aren't specific things in the UK, obviously,
4743000	4745000	and Jamie tries to stay on top of those,
4745000	4747000	but just kind of the nature of the business is,
4747000	4750000	most of the business is done in Tokyo and in the Bay Area.
4750000	4754000	So we try to keep tabs on release dates and things of that nature,
4754000	4756000	because we heart our international listeners,
4756000	4759000	but keep in mind, usually when games are under development and things,
4759000	4762000	it is kind of over on this side.
4762000	4764000	But then again, they do get some games that we don't get,
4764000	4765000	like mostly football.
4765000	4767000	Once in a while, once in a while.
4767000	4769000	Some of the games of that nature.
4769000	4772000	I try to keep my eyes open for specific ones.
4772000	4773000	So think of it this way.
4773000	4775000	Hey, at least if we're getting the games first,
4775000	4776000	we can tell you which ones suck,
4776000	4778000	and then that way you don't even have to blink an eye
4778000	4779000	when they come out over there.
4779000	4780000	Exactly.
4780000	4781000	For what little it's worth,
4781000	4784000	because we can't force the companies to change their schedule or whatever.
4784000	4786000	By the way, I think we had a slightly increased listenership this week,
4786000	4788000	because iTunes had us,
4788000	4791000	they have video games as their featured category and podcast this week,
4791000	4792000	and we're one of them that's in the little box.
4792000	4793000	So that's kind of cool.
4793000	4797000	So thank you iTunes.
4797000	4798000	Is that it for voicemails?
4798000	4799000	That would be it.
4799000	4800000	Alrighty.
4800000	4802000	You mean emails?
4802000	4803000	Oh yeah, emails, sorry.
4803000	4805000	Give them my voice.
4805000	4809000	1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to leave us a voicemail,
4809000	4813000	because we're not unable to be live until January of 2007.
4813000	4816000	I want voicemail from some of our overseas listeners now.
4816000	4817000	That's true.
4817000	4819000	This listener could call our voicemail any time.
4819000	4822000	Now don't use the 800, but you can go through Skype.
4822000	4823000	Oh yeah, sorry, that's right.
4823000	4825000	International folks don't want to use it, unless you're Canadian.
4825000	4826000	Unless you're Canadian.
4826000	4827000	You can use the 800.
4827000	4829000	But download Skype.
4829000	4832000	You can actually just send us the message through the Skype line.
4832000	4834000	It's a voiceover IP.
4834000	4836000	It costs your internet connection.
4836000	4837000	That's it.
4837000	4838000	That's it.
4838000	4841000	So go to orangesonusradio.com and click on Interact With Us for more information.
4841000	4842000	It's all free.
4842000	4843000	All free?
4843000	4844000	Yes, please.
4844000	4845000	Excellent.
4845000	4847000	Well, getting back into some news here.
4847000	4852000	One thing that we talk about, especially in games and stuff, is all these ads.
4852000	4857000	And a big thing when we were doing the Battlefield 2142 stuff
4857000	4862000	was that their advertisements had a little kind of a spyware feel to it
4862000	4867000	because they were picking up your IP and where you're located and that kind of thing
4867000	4869000	so they could target ads towards you.
4869000	4872000	Not a huge deal to some people, but a big deal to others.
4872000	4876000	Well, apparently it's a big deal to some Californian lawmakers.
4876000	4884000	California Assemblywoman Lori Saldana is going to be working on introducing a bill
4884000	4888000	into state legislation that would halt companies like EA
4888000	4891000	from including spyware technology in games.
4891000	4899000	And they found certain methods used by these companies as particularly vile, as she puts it,
4899000	4905000	and definitely something that I'd like to see passed because I'm not sure.
4905000	4907000	I don't think it's on our show roll.
4907000	4910000	We were talking about advertising in games and somehow it's not very effective.
4910000	4916000	And so gathering information from these companies and EA is really bad on this,
4916000	4920000	especially with where you have to sign up and have your credit card information and stuff like that.
4920000	4921000	It's not good.
4921000	4925000	What I'm interested in is, she seems to get it.
4925000	4926000	Yeah.
4926000	4928000	Who is she? How did she figure out about it?
4928000	4930000	I mean, is she a gamer?
4930000	4934000	No, it's just, I don't know, she just seems to get it.
4934000	4939000	Because one thing we felt like we haven't had much of in the political world
4939000	4942000	is some type of pro-gaming champion.
4942000	4944000	I don't mean like a professional gamer,
4944000	4948000	but I mean like somebody who supports the video games and the gaming community.
4948000	4950000	We've certainly had a lot of anti.
4950000	4955000	I think she's kind of interested in, it's mainly privacy experts.
4955000	4958000	I see, so she's more of like an EFF type champion.
4958000	4962000	Yeah, and I think this just kind of relates a little bit to stuff like that.
4962000	4967000	And basically she's saying that it doesn't advertise it on the outside of the packaging
4967000	4968000	and it contains the stuff.
4968000	4971000	It's like you bought it and then, oh, by the way,
4971000	4977000	we forgot to mention that installing this will actually send us some private data.
4977000	4980000	And you need to do this in order to play the game.
4980000	4984000	I would just like to see someone who gets gaming in Congress, that's all.
4984000	4986000	Jamie, run for Congress.
4986000	4990000	Okay, pay my way.
4990000	4993000	Vote for Jamie, Kay, thanks.
4993000	4995000	Yeah, vote for Jamie, or die.
4995000	4999000	All right, anyway, well that should be interesting to see what happens with that.
4999000	5001000	I think that's kind of cool.
5001000	5004000	I think it's something that should, I think the companies should know.
5004000	5008000	They're going to be looked at if they're going to use these type of tactics, so I support it.
5008000	5012000	I'm curious to see what the specifics of the bill will be.
5012000	5017000	Since this is our holiday episode, this last official story we have for you guys
5017000	5022000	has to do with Bethesda and their big, big, big game Oblivion.
5022000	5027000	They are giving away for Christmas a brand new expansion pack for Oblivion.
5027000	5030000	Well, it's not new, but it's...
5030000	5032000	I was going to say, it's a Christmas theme pack or whatever.
5032000	5034000	No, it's not a theme pack either.
5034000	5037000	It's one of the older expansions. They dropped the price to free.
5037000	5040000	Oh, I thought it was a new one.
5040000	5042000	Oh, all right, well, whatever.
5042000	5046000	Maroon's Razor, which I guess used to cost money, it's now being offered for free.
5046000	5049000	Well, that sucks to everyone who bought it before.
5049000	5052000	Never mind, these guys are grinches for doing that to those people.
5052000	5055000	Unfortunately, I have not played any of the Oblivion expansions.
5055000	5058000	I apologize for my mistake.
5058000	5060000	You know what expansion pack I'm going to be downloading?
5060000	5063000	What? The Saints Row Ho-Ho-Ho pack.
5063000	5066000	Ho-Ho-Ho, does it come with Ho-Ho-Hos?
5066000	5068000	It comes with Christmas themed stuff.
5068000	5070000	You know, I'm sorry, we missed this in our story.
5070000	5072000	I don't remember this being mentioned unless I just forgot.
5072000	5076000	Gran Turismo HD is coming for free as well from Sony.
5076000	5078000	So, tis the season.
5078000	5082000	So, I guess Nintendo is the Grinch after all, not putting out anything for you.
5082000	5084000	Well, they did have the internet channel, so maybe not.
5084000	5089000	They did give you that and the forecast channel coming up the news channel too.
5089000	5091000	But the internet channel, you know, is free.
5091000	5094000	So, I guess we all got a little something for Christmas.
5094000	5097000	Now, here's something I got to mention though, and I'm not sure if you noticed.
5097000	5099000	Wii Connect 24, what the fuck does it actually do?
5099000	5102000	Because it sure as hell doesn't update my system.
5102000	5105000	It sure as hell doesn't download this new stuff automatically.
5105000	5106000	What the fuck?
5106000	5109000	I think it's one of those wait and see things with later games.
5109000	5112000	I think it's the type of thing where, you know, Animal Crossing,
5112000	5115000	people will visit your village when you're not there, type of thing.
5115000	5119000	Like, I mean, seriously, because, you know,
5119000	5122000	it was supposed to be downloading the updates automatically so I wouldn't have to.
5122000	5124000	Like, so, poof, the internet channel should be there,
5124000	5127000	or the forecast channel should be there instead of having to,
5127000	5130000	oh, by the way, the forecast channel is there, hit update, you know.
5130000	5132000	No, it should be automatic.
5132000	5134000	Well, at least you get that message.
5134000	5136000	That's, I don't know, you have the message, right?
5136000	5140000	Nintendo sent you a little email that said the forecast channel is now available, right?
5140000	5144000	Yeah, great, good for them, but it's not, you know, this Wii Connect 24.
5144000	5147000	It's always connected to the internet.
5147000	5151000	No, it's always connected, but it's not doing anything.
5151000	5153000	All right.
5153000	5157000	Well, we have another segment here before we close out the show,
5157000	5161000	and that would be Dark Sakura, who likes to surf the internet up and down and left and right
5161000	5165000	and all that be-a-select-start kind of stuff.
5165000	5169000	She finds a website that she must share with all of you guys,
5169000	5172000	and it's called Dark Sakura's Website of the Week.
5172000	5177000	And we have happy music.
5177000	5180000	So this week's website better be happy.
5180000	5181000	I didn't do crap to find it.
5181000	5182000	You told me about it.
5182000	5183000	Oh, goody, you used my pick.
5183000	5185000	I made a suggestion, and it got picked.
5185000	5187000	I'm so excited.
5187000	5191000	Wekitty.com, W-I-I-K-I-T-T-Y dot com.
5191000	5193000	This site is crack.
5193000	5196000	It has a gallery of cats and Wiis, and it's so cute.
5196000	5198000	You can see the kitty.
5198000	5200000	So it's like stuff on my cat but with Wii controllers?
5200000	5201000	Yeah.
5201000	5202000	This is awesome.
5202000	5203000	This is fantastic.
5203000	5204000	I need to do one with Shermie.
5204000	5209000	And on top of that, they actually say Happy Catter Day, which makes me think of 4chan.
5209000	5212000	So, yeah, this is cute and those are kitties.
5212000	5215000	I'm going to submit Shermie on Wekitty.
5215000	5219000	I'm going to go look at Wekitty on my Wii and bookmark it as a favorite.
5219000	5223000	I actually have Shermie snuggling up to an Xbox 360 controller.
5223000	5224000	There you go.
5224000	5227000	Well, you should make 360kitty.com.
5227000	5229000	No, I'm not going to pay for domain.
5229000	5230000	They're cheap.
5230000	5231000	Loki, you can do it.
5231000	5232000	I can do it.
5232000	5237000	You should put like ps3kitty.com and have a PS3 crushing the cat because it's so heavy.
5237000	5243000	No, I got it catbox360 and have like, do like litter boxes up like an Xbox.
5243000	5245000	That would be rad.
5245000	5250000	I did notice that Wekitty did use the opportunity to give a big fat plug for the people who
5250000	5252000	made it their own personal little game review site.
5252000	5256000	So, you know, we could use 360kitty or whatever as a big plug.
5256000	5257000	I don't know.
5257000	5258000	I want to jump on the bandwagon.
5258000	5260000	How about the Xbox puppy?
5260000	5262000	Where's the love for the puppies?
5262000	5266000	Puppies are stinky and they require too much attention.
5266000	5270000	I would admit that I'm a cat person over a dog person, but I do think puppies do deserve
5270000	5271000	a little bit of love.
5271000	5275000	How about dsgerbils.com?
5275000	5277000	Lovehamster.com.
5277000	5280000	There you go.
5280000	5282000	With a P.
5282000	5286000	When you say love hamster, start thinking of that corn cob vibrator and thinking that
5286000	5290000	they should do like a hamster vibrator.
5290000	5293000	No.
5293000	5295000	Last minute stories, anyone?
5295000	5299000	Yes.
5299000	5301000	Are UK listeners want UK news?
5301000	5303000	I got some.
5303000	5304000	Pro Evolution Soccer 6.
5304000	5306000	What's Cheerio then?
5306000	5307000	Hey.
5307000	5308000	You know what?
5308000	5309000	I hate all the ads on this.
5309000	5310000	Okay.
5310000	5315000	Pro Evolution Soccer 6 is now a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace.
5315000	5319000	It's the rival of FIFA 07.
5319000	5326000	It's only available for Xbox Gold, but it will be available to Silver on the 29th.
5326000	5330000	It's a 1.31 gigabyte game.
5330000	5332000	Tell us what's on it because we don't know.
5332000	5334000	I'm not a football girl.
5334000	5339000	Isn't this the same one we saw an early build of at the Panami BBQ?
5339000	5340000	Yes.
5340000	5341000	Pro Evolution.
5341000	5344000	It looked pretty hot for soccer.
5344000	5346000	Not that I'm necessarily.
5346000	5347000	Okay.
5347000	5350000	I have to say I do love football a little bit.
5350000	5353000	You're a rugby girl.
5353000	5354000	No.
5354000	5359000	When I say football, I mean soccer because American football is shit.
5359000	5360000	Pure and simple.
5360000	5361000	Sorry.
5361000	5362000	It is.
5362000	5363000	It's crap.
5363000	5365000	It's a crap sport and it's just crap.
5365000	5370000	More people will probably watch football if they had cheerleaders like American football.
5370000	5374000	It seems to be the most popular sport in this nation.
5374000	5377000	Yeah, and the rest of the world says, screw you, that's stupid.
5377000	5379000	We like real football.
5379000	5381000	It gives me excuse to watch men in shorts.
5381000	5382000	I like basketball.
5382000	5383000	Yeah, but you know what?
5383000	5389000	The rest of the world may be all about this metric system, but hey, we're too good for that.
5389000	5393000	It's all about fucking base 12 systems.
5393000	5394000	Hell yeah.
5394000	5395000	You mean the imperial system?
5395000	5396000	Yeah.
5396000	5404000	Well, doesn't it sound much nicer to hear that it's 40 degrees Fahrenheit outside?
5404000	5408000	It doesn't sound so bad as negative two.
5408000	5410000	Anyway, forget it.
5410000	5411000	Never mind.
5411000	5414000	Well, there's another one as well.
5414000	5420000	For the record, I agree the metric system is better just to get that on record.
5420000	5424000	Nintendo has stated that the reports that came out of France saying that Wii Sports
5424000	5430000	was already in development is, quote, a rumor and speculation.
5430000	5432000	But pretty good speculation of that, honestly.
5432000	5438000	Well, NGC France reported that there was one that might include swimming, basketball, a
5438000	5440000	few other sports.
5440000	5445000	The quote, though, coming from Nintendo is really pleased with the reaction to Wii Sports.
5445000	5451000	From people completely new to gaming to the hardcore fans, everywhere has taken to it
5451000	5452000	straight away.
5452000	5458000	That's a quote from one of the Nintendo UK spokespeople, and they're actually speculating
5458000	5460000	it might be the most popular game.
5460000	5461000	Interesting.
5461000	5463000	The love for Wii soccer.
5463000	5465000	Dude, that would be cool.
5465000	5466000	Would you kick your controller around that?
5466000	5467000	I know.
5467000	5468000	How would you do that?
5468000	5473000	You put your controller in the ball mode.
5473000	5476000	Well, it detects directions.
5476000	5477000	That's a great idea.
5477000	5481000	Then people can kick the ball around the house because the Wiis aren't breaking enough
5481000	5483000	things around the house as it is.
5483000	5485000	Kick a ball through the window.
5485000	5486000	Real smart, Jamie.
5486000	5488000	A winner is you.
5488000	5489000	Was I serious?
5489000	5490000	No.
5490000	5491000	Partially.
5491000	5492000	No.
5492000	5494000	Do you need to come out with the Wii Battle Axe?
5494000	5498000	Dude, could you bet a golden axe on the Wii?
5498000	5501000	No, I want, what was that, Time Killers or whatever that game was.
5501000	5503000	Remember back in the day when Mortal Kombat was big?
5503000	5505000	You had that game, what was it?
5505000	5510000	You had two buttons for arm and two for legs and one for head, and that was the game.
5510000	5511000	What was that?
5511000	5512000	It was like Time Killers or something like that?
5512000	5513000	I don't remember.
5513000	5514000	Oh my god, that game was awesome.
5514000	5519000	I mean, it was kind of stupid in the gameplay value, but getting to chop people's arms and
5519000	5525000	legs off and then they still have to fight with no arms or legs was really funny.
5525000	5526000	Clay Fighter, man?
5526000	5527000	Your arm's off.
5527000	5529000	Alright, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?
5529000	5530000	Of course I do.
5530000	5536160	So, the story came out, apparently there's a way modifying your own DVD firmware in your
5536160	5539800	own CD-ROM drive or DVD-ROM drive on your PC.
5539800	5546160	You're able to rip Wii discs, so now the pirates have won yet another battle.
5546160	5550040	It's only a matter of time before we see pirated games, you can run on the Wii.
5550040	5553520	Until Nintendo says, oh, you want that news channel?
5553520	5556280	That's what they'll use Wii Connect 24 with the updates.
5556280	5559800	They'll just silently push out the updates that'll patch that kind of shit.
5559800	5562720	Well, they haven't done it yet.
5562720	5563720	We'll see.
5563720	5566600	And who says I have to connect it to the internet while I'm playing these games?
5566600	5572040	And to be honest, if they can burn them the exact same way as the discs are burnt now,
5572040	5573040	they'll never know.
5573040	5574040	We'll see.
5574040	5575040	We'll see.
5575040	5581620	Anyways, that being said, let's see here, also, it's kind of funny, you know how if
5581620	5587000	you register three games with Nintendo that you get a free three month trial to Nintendo
5587000	5588000	Power?
5588000	5592340	Well, apparently the folks at gonintendo.com found out that the Wii internet channel counts
5592340	5597920	as a game and now they get a free subscription.
5597920	5598920	That's kind of funny.
5598920	5599920	Does it really?
5599920	5602600	I mean, I have my subscription a lot of the time, but I actually have all my Nintendo
5602600	5605840	products registered on Nintendo and it's a lot now because of those stinking virtual
5605840	5606840	console games.
5606840	5610640	I have the virtual console tied to my Nintendo account and you get credit for all those games
5610640	5611640	you download.
5611640	5614760	I really wish here in the US they did some type of reward systems like they did in the
5614760	5617300	other countries.
5617300	5622520	If you're using the Wii browser and find that you really want tabbed browsing in the Wii,
5622520	5623520	well fear not.
5623520	5626960	The website has actually figured out a way to do that.
5626960	5638080	If you want to browse tabbed websites, you can check out team-dsx.net slash ds slash
5638080	5644440	basic dot php and apparently this was used for the Opera browser on the DS, but can also
5644440	5649520	be used for the Wii Opera browser to add tabbed browsing functionality.
5649520	5654360	I don't want tabbed browsing so much as I want support for my USB keyboard.
5654360	5657560	That would be nice.
5657560	5664820	And of course, since there was the free Gran Turismo HD demo being put out there, it actually
5664820	5672080	ended up leaking a little bit early on the Playstation 3 network and crashed it because
5672080	5676720	it was more than it can handle, which is kind of fun.
5676720	5683280	We mentioned that Bethesda is putting out the free Oblivion expansion, or I should say
5683280	5690400	dropping the price on it, but more companies are actually putting out new content as well.
5690400	5696260	Test Drive Unlimited being one of those, you can now download a 1971 Dodge Challenger RT
5696260	5700240	in the game for free and that's available in all regions.
5700240	5706800	Also going along with that, the Test Drive Racers Guild download set, which is 350 Microsoft
5706800	5720600	points, includes the Ferrari 612 and the McLaren F1 GT, Dodge Viper SRT10 coupe, and many more.
5720600	5722040	So that's kind of cool.
5722040	5730960	They've also got a free Forza Motorsports Showdown trailer, which is available on both
5730960	5734960	Canada and US Xbox Live.
5734960	5741960	And then also three different Command & Conquer Tiberian Wars themes as well can be downloaded
5741960	5747040	for 150 points each, and actually they do have a trailer as well for that, which is
5747040	5748680	of course free.
5748680	5756120	And finally, Transformers, the movie trailer leaked out this week and was pretty awesome
5756120	5757120	on Yahoo.
5757120	5763600	I'm kind of surprised it wasn't that bad, and keep in mind I'm not as attached to Transformers.
5763600	5782960	You haven't seen the Transformers movie trailer?
5782960	5787840	Speaking of the trailer, apparently there was some interesting stuff shown during the
5787840	5792240	trailer between the 37 second and 39 second mark on there.
5792240	5799160	There's a frame that shows Sector 7 Org at the top and Takara-83 at the bottom.
5799160	5806880	And apparently that, if you go to sector7.org and enter in Takara-83, it starts an ARG.
5806880	5812080	So brand new alternate reality game tied in with the Transformers thing, a new viral campaign.
5812080	5816660	And then when you solve it, you get forwarded to All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com.
5816660	5817660	Isn't that amazing?
5817660	5818660	Yeah, that'd be funny.
5818660	5824000	No, but it's a brand new start, so definitely worth checking out, I guess.
5824000	5825000	Alrighty.
5825000	5833360	Oh, and I'd like to also mention, just to kind of start the show the way I started it,
5833360	5838320	1UP is reporting Earth Defense Force 2017 is coming to the US, and I do believe I mentioned
5838320	5841160	that on an earlier podcast.
5841160	5842160	So humble.
5842160	5843600	The great and humble Loki.
5843600	5846160	Alright, that's it.
5846160	5849600	It's only a one-part show tonight, because the holiday and the pre-tape and everything.
5849600	5853040	So this is the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
5853040	5854040	And I'll start tonight.
5854040	5859720	My final thought is January 22nd and heroes returning to TV.
5859720	5860960	I can't wait.
5860960	5863580	It's too long.
5863580	5866760	At least I have some Kiefer Sutherland to hold me over.
5866760	5868760	Let me know when my man is on that show so I can come watch it.
5868760	5870800	He's supposed to be on the first episode.
5870800	5872200	So what is that?
5872200	5874640	January 22nd, so you better watch the first 11 before that.
5874640	5875640	What night is that?
5875640	5876640	It's Sunday.
5876640	5877640	F school.
5877640	5878640	Damn you.
5878640	5880520	Well, that's...
5880520	5882760	And on the 8th day the Lord gave us TiVo.
5882760	5888880	Yeah, and also just to mention, the volume is going to be on sort of moderate hiatus.
5888880	5889880	More info on the website.
5889880	5890880	Yeah.
5890880	5891880	Alright.
5891880	5892880	I didn't mean to...
5892880	5893880	No, that's alright.
5893880	5894880	Your final thought, then Dark Sakura.
5894880	5897280	Um, I need new lungs.
5897280	5899280	And reject false icons.
5899280	5900280	Loki?
5900280	5904400	Um, my final thought is, I'm not buying more Ubisoft games.
5904400	5908080	Thanks, I want to get somebody from that company on the show so bad.
5908080	5910080	I want a one-on-one with Loki.
5910080	5914640	Alright, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent radio.
5914640	5915680	We really appreciate it.
5915680	5918520	You guys keep it alive and keep us going here.
5918520	5920660	We can't wait to head into 2007.
5920660	5921800	We got one more show for you guys.
5921800	5924160	It's going to be a wacky show next week.
5924160	5927800	Also, next week or the week after one of those shows, we're going to be celebrating our second
5927800	5932400	year, or I should say, moving into our third year of podcasting.
5932400	5935560	If you can believe it, we've been doing podcasting for a while now.
5935560	5940160	And of course, on the 29th, Club OLR will be debuting on Friday.
5940160	5941160	Thank you for reminding me.
5941160	5942160	7pm.
5942160	5943160	More news on the site to come.
5943160	5944160	Yes.
5944160	5945160	You need to post in your forum more information.
5945160	5946160	I'm sorry.
5946160	5947160	Loki.
5947160	5948160	Slacking, humble Loki.
5948160	5949160	Alright.
5949160	5950160	Thank you guys so much.
5950160	5951160	Have a great week.
