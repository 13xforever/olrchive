13891	24990	Tonight, December 24th, 2006, some new channels make their debut on the Wii, a California lawmaker targets spyware in games, and is Katamari about to roll over Xbox Live Arcade?
32847	37329	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37349	42231	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42651	48894	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49354	49695	Yo.
50015	51155	How you doing, Miss Thing?
51435	51916	Hackin'.
52336	53376	Yeah, a little sick today?
53396	58378	A little of that and trying to play with my IP on my computer so I can fool the BBC.
58739	59059	I see.
59519	61840	Did Santa bring you the flu, the plague?
62372	64613	The plague has returned, but not nearly as bad.
64673	66094	I'm prepared for it this time around.
66354	66954	That's good to hear.
67715	70496	Say hello as well to the always prepared Techmaster, Loki!
70757	71037	Hello.
71337	72117	How you doing, Loki?
72758	74278	I was doing okay.
74338	75219	You were doing okay?
75239	75719	What happened?
77940	78761	I'll mention it later.
78781	79081	It's just...
79400	86103	It's more of the same crap, you know, where people are reporting exclusive stories that I have reported weeks ago type thing.
86303	90344	Now, I told you, go post this in the forum in your little thread there.
90445	90725	I did.
90885	93766	I did do that stuff.
93846	94226	No, no, no.
94246	97828	I'm saying post the person who's saying that they have the exclusive story.
97928	101449	Post that there and, you know, the listeners can see for themselves there.
102990	105030	Orange Lounge Radio is one of the best kept secrets on the internet.
105831	106071	Anyway.
106818	107698	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
125765	127247	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
140971	146555	Ah, that's... You know, as much crap as I give mobile phone games on this program, I actually really enjoyed the Luminous one.
146595	147616	It wasn't bad for mobile.
147816	149597	I'm not going to reinstall Super Pac-Man.
149738	150778	It's just not worth it.
151018	152259	It's too damn hard to play.
152520	153080	It's not the same.
153100	162226	Well, it's not really... It's a good emulation of it, but it's just difficult with a... You need one of the bigger phones to do it, and I have a very small phone.
162667	164648	You know what cell phone game I have on my phone?
164808	165069	What?
165189	165869	Burger Time.
166249	166830	You're crazy.
168467	170550	I'm thinking about downloading Tetris.
170971	171712	I don't know if it'll work.
172613	174857	The one I have on mine, I know we have different carriers.
174877	176039	Is it the Jamdat Tetris?
176279	176940	I think so.
177281	178543	It's very blue.
178964	179465	It's not bad.
180807	182750	I'd like to mention, just real quick.
183166	184027	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
213630	219833	I don't care, but Dan's been wanting an indie for a while, and that's pretty cool.
220073	221293	When are you going to get PinBot?
222134	222654	I want one.
222754	223694	Actually, we want JackBot.
224735	227276	I don't, you know, your fancy schmancy bootlegs or whatever.
227456	228877	It's not a bootleg.
229457	233579	JackBot is the modern pinball version.
233599	234399	Whatever, whatever.
234419	240682	It's got the same tracks as PinBot and has the bonus segment from Bride of PinBot.
242017	242537	All right, whatever.
242738	243318	So it's really cool.
243378	246300	However, we do have friends who have a pinbot, so I can just go over there and play it anytime I want.
246860	249242	But does it do the thing where it goes, I am pinbot?
249362	249642	Yes.
249963	250243	Okay, good.
250283	253305	It is a fully functional pinbot, and that game is fucking hard.
254365	256387	On the NES, it was pretty hard, too.
256767	259469	Because on the NES, it had little aliens that would try to eat your ball.
260049	262811	But the actual pinball machine is just difficult.
263031	263272	I see.
263292	265953	But I have a special place in my heart for pinbot.
266274	266494	All right.
267094	267995	Anything else you played this week?
270396	271277	Besides playing with fire?
271960	276463	I did play with fire because I lit candles on the winter solstice.
277104	278405	They need to make fire the game.
279826	284069	Well, there's putting out fire the game, the brave firefighters.
284410	285911	Okay, alright.
286011	288112	That's a year-end award I'd like to see.
288232	289634	Best use of fire in a game.
289674	292055	I did... Well, there's also Burning Rangers back in the day.
292816	293677	I played another game, though.
293797	294117	What's that?
294497	299061	I did play that Marine Harpoon Sega game because I was at Walmart and I was bored.
299781	300602	So I played...
301806	303527	I played the harpoon game.
303607	304247	And how was that?
304507	304867	Sucks.
305168	305448	Alright.
305868	310210	It's been the first time you play it and that's like, this screen has burned in.
310450	310870	Fix.
311931	313272	Loki, how was your gaming week?
313532	314992	How was my gaming week?
315232	315633	Okay.
315893	318134	I played a lot of crappy games, unfortunately.
318834	321716	I played Cars on the Wii and it sucked ass.
322216	322936	I bought it for Nelly.
323096	325798	You know, she said she could try it and then she agreed it did suck ass.
326478	326558	Um.
327119	354135	Then I kind of went back on what I said about Ubisoft And I went and bought another Ubisoft game And this only further, you know, proves that their games suck Because I went and bought Monster 4x4 World Circuit Despite the reviews, you know, I said Oh, they're just probably complaining because the graphics look like GameCube graphics And it's not like we've been able to trust any major gaming press review recently anyway Exactly, so, you know
354804	361369	I thought, hey, you know, what the hell, it sounds like it could be like Excite Truck, it's four players, that could be fun.
362430	363171	No, it's not.
363619	367983	What the hell is this piece of shit that you gave me?
368104	370746	Because this is obviously not a real game.
370846	374450	I've done that with a game before.
374570	375311	But what game?
388624	394589	It was the WWF, at the time, Thunder game on PlayStation.
394749	398712	It was so bad that Dan and I took it back to Blockbuster and had them trade it out.
398792	404017	Seriously, I would urge anyone not to even consider this as an alternative to Excite Truck.
404037	406138	This is not even close.
406439	410102	Well, most people don't like Excite Truck either, so they're just like, you know what?
410142	411323	No racing on the Wii for me.
412143	413945	Are you going to pick up Need for Speed Carbon?
413985	414806	Give it one more shot.
415786	417628	No, I'm not picking up Need for Speed Carbon.
417938	421579	If you're just being carbon, I know what kind of a game it is, and so I know it would be pretty decent.
421619	429282	It's just not the same type of a game as Excite Truck, but Monster Farmer 4 World Circuit, it's slow, doing the tricks is hard.
429302	432484	But it comes with the LEET steering wheel peripheral.
432744	435585	Oh yeah, the LEET steering wheel peripheral, that's a piece of shit.
436125	438806	I brought it into the studio today, okay?
438886	444328	I brought it to have Christopher try it out so he can give a review on the next show, but it is awful.
444528	446489	It is a really bad game, and I...
447304	451447	I'm sorry, but they just... So they had six or seven launch games.
451508	453729	Yeah, but they all sucked, Ubisoft.
453749	459114	You're just trying to capitalize on the lack of titles, you know, being out there and hoping people will get to buy this stuff.
459254	459854	And you know what?
459974	467961	I'm sure a lot of people bought this stuff, and I don't know, maybe their kids liked it and stuff, but it's just, it's an awful game.
468161	475107	And once you play, you know, like Excite Truck or something like that, or Need for Speed Carbon, you're just like, wow, what the hell is this shit?
475712	480553	So, I urge you, do not buy this game, because you'll only be disappointed.
481933	486174	Do you think Ubisoft might be able to redeem themselves with some of the later games that are coming out in 2007?
486334	489255	With, you know, 360, they have some pretty big titles planned, right?
489735	497336	Well, 360, they've got Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, which looks okay, but it looks exactly the same as Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 1.
498616	500897	So, you know, Warfighter 2, great.
501237	502277	I mean, seriously, I...
503886	506969	I challenge you to look at the screenshots and be able to tell the two games apart.
507349	507830	You can't.
508270	509551	They look exactly the same.
509691	511553	So, I don't know.
511573	514195	I mean, but then again, people like stuff that's the same.
514335	515416	So, it should be fine.
515456	517598	And Rainbow Six Vegas, I heard, was pretty good.
517738	518759	It's just not my type of game.
519480	525145	But, I've seen some of the stuff that they're coming out for the Wii, for, you know, say in, um,
525891	527732	It's not anything new, let me put it that way.
527872	535698	It's just ports of old shit that they're tacking the controls on, and they really need to come out and create some new games, and I'm not talking about Red Steel 2.
536619	538500	I'm talking about a brand new game.
539461	541202	Does Reggie need to come lay the smack down?
541442	541982	I think so.
542643	547246	I think they're just looking at numbers, you know, and Red Steel sold really well.
547346	550348	It's just, it wasn't that good of a game.
550648	554351	You know, people were looking for another GoldenEye, and it was not GoldenEye.
555446	556331	Alright, was that it?
557559	559940	MyGamingWeek Nothing really new to report for you guys.
559961	561562	I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff.
561602	565405	I've been playing Every Extend Extra, a little bit of Luminous 2 as well.
565505	580316	Still playing Burnout on Xbox and I'm getting very frustrated at how bad I suck at Burnout because the achievements, for one of them you have to get all, basically the majority of the achievements are you get all perfect ratings in every difficulty level.
580616	585780	Well, I'm one star shy in the very first basic difficulty level.
585820	586461	There's one
586840	591063	Freaking Race, I cannot get a gold medal in, and therefore I'm not able to get a perfect.
591324	595287	And it's frustrating the hell out of me how badly I suck at Burnout, so I cry a lot.
595567	599110	But it does give me an opportunity to use custom soundtracks and listen to, you know.
600311	608317	What's kind of funny is usually I'll put in the soundtrack to Wangan and Midnight Maximum Tune, and I'll play Burnout to that.
608437	608998	And it's kind of fun.
609978	611199	So, yay for custom soundtracks.
611399	614140	And you know, I've been watching Extifer play a lot of Excite Truck.
614440	625024	By the way, I'd like to point out, he just finally got, just like as of a few moments ago, got the very last trophy, the Super Duper Rings trophy, and says that nothing else happens, you just get all the trophies, that's it.
625064	629946	But he's been using the SD card that Jamie got him for Christmas to do all the custom soundtracks there.
629966	631987	He needs to get all the challenge modes finished, and then...
632327	634829	I think that unlocks one other thing that's minor.
635369	637770	He's done every single possible thing you can do in race mode.
637810	641973	I mean, I don't know anybody besides Nelly that's probably as obsessed with this game as X4 is.
642013	646235	Most people wrote off Excite Truck as kind of cheap compared to X4 360 Racers.
646756	647016	Really?
647796	648917	I have it in Dan House.
649517	649978	Interesting.
650658	658383	It's so interesting because this game kind of got a lot of critical heat against it, but it's really caught on with a lot of folks that I've...
659108	660669	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
680450	682792	It's kind of got the same formula, almost.
682872	688217	I mean, the way that you score points and stuff for doing drifts and, you know... I mean, Sidetrack does have its weaknesses.
688417	690379	Lack of online support being the biggest, you know.
690419	692440	Well, that's just... I know, it's lame.
692861	693561	That really is lame.
693661	695063	Lack of four-player racing.
695243	695823	Stupid.
696144	697084	I mean, come on.
697625	706913	I mean, I really don't understand Nintendo in just saying, Oh, you know, all these other consoles have been online for the last two generations, um...
707634	710477	No, we're just not gonna, we just don't feel it right now.
710938	711739	No, you're stupid.
711859	713581	You're stupid, stupid, stupid.
726977	729618	and I can't help but wonder how Mario Kart's going to do.
729638	732639	Because you know that's inevitable that we'll get a Mario Kart on the Wii eventually.
732659	734140	Well, hopefully it won't suck.
734160	735060	Probably not until 2008.
735140	738442	I hope it won't suck as bad as Double Dash because Double Dash blew ass.
739762	741303	But the DS one was pretty rad.
741483	742824	And that's the most recent one, really.
742884	745185	That's because it's like Mario Kart 64.
745365	747746	That's why it rocked.
747946	755069	But the thing is though is it better have online play because if it doesn't, that's a huge mistake.
755849	756029	And
756775	757135	ExciteTrek 2
778892	779252	Sort of.
779613	780053	Kind of.
780073	780974	I guess I could see that a little bit.
780994	781915	And sort of the feel of the game.
782055	782975	Yeah, I could see that a little bit.
783116	787379	If they had the multiplayer be, or sort of like how, what was that game?
787659	791482	Oh God, I can't remember.
791522	794205	It's 2099, one of the racing games.
794385	798268	You know what Excite... It had the dial-in thing to where you could... You know what Excite Trek reminds me of?
798328	800930	You mean Rush 2049?
801230	802331	Yes, thank you.
802972	804293	You know what Excite Trek reminds me of?
805073	805494	A woman.
808056	808276	How?
809042	811383	and DarkSakura.com.
839662	840843	Anything else on Excite Trek?
841043	842104	Oh, it was still my gaming week.
842345	843346	Eh, who cares?
844186	847670	DS, Final Fantasy 3, which I'm loving more and more, even though it's kind of hard.
848190	851974	And I finally got the four-star difficulty in Elite Beat Agents.
852254	853155	God, I love that game.
853876	854356	I really do.
854697	856518	Expect to see that in my top ten for the year.
856859	857539	I'll tell you that much.
858861	859141	All right.
859992	863054	Let's get into some housekeeping real quick before we get into the news.
863514	865355	Next week's show is also going to be pre-taped.
865375	866335	We're pre-taped tonight.
866355	873159	We're not live, as we mentioned previously, but those of you guys on our audio RSS, also known as podcasting, have a chance to download the program.
873789	874709	and so hello folks.
875429	876750	Next week is going to be the same deal.
876790	878550	However, next week is going to be a special show.
878890	894694	Since we're anticipating there's not going to be a lot of news due to the holiday season, what we're going to do is we're going to do sort of a year-end special and we're inviting a lot of our friends as in other podcasters, other shows on OLR, guests that we've had previously on the program and people in the industry.
895014	896214	We're inviting a whole
896601	897061	DarkSakura.com
925097	931623	Also, we want to mention Dig.com just recently added podcasting to their listing, and we want to thank you guys who've dug us.
932304	937128	Not bad, considering we haven't really mentioned it on the show or on the front page of the site.
937148	941372	We did give it a shout-out on the forums, and I know All Games has really been helping out with that effort as well.
941392	944575	We've gotten, I don't know, 60-something digs on the podcast.
944595	945175	That's pretty cool.
945475	951401	So if you feel like going and supporting that a little more, that would be awesome, because it all helps to spread the word, which, as you know,
951821	960104	Independent Radio has to rely on to get the news out there because we don't have no magazine that gives us free two, three page spreads in to promote our product.
960465	963266	So you have to go on there and vote.
964566	972549	And isn't it interesting that even that being said that the Corpcast, you know, because they're so out there and so pushed, they end up getting dug the most too.
972769	974890	Well, they do have employees that can go and dig.
975090	976031	I suppose that's true too.
976271	976531	Oh, well.
977411	980873	Anywho, let's get into some gaming news starting with Loki.
981133	981513	Definitely.
981923	985346	And of course this week we had two updates to it.
985746	989549	The forecast channel and the internet channel being added.
989609	991950	The forecast channel is, well, weather.
992591	995613	And it was pretty simplistic, but fun to play around with.
995753	998055	I spun the globe a lot because I was bored.
998115	999576	I think we all spun the globe.
1000777	1001938	That's what you do with globes.
1001998	1005380	I mean, when I was in school and I'd find a globe, I'd spin it.
1005860	1006841	That's pretty much it.
1006901	1009183	We would try to find the funniest city name.
1009756	1015099	I would take stickers and paste them all over the globe.
1031337	1033579	So those have been the launch.
1033679	1043888	The, of course, internet channel is free until June 2007, or June 30th, 2007, which it'll be pay afterwards, five bucks afterwards.
1044528	1046410	Right now, I guess they're considering it a beta.
1047411	1048672	Why is it not done?
1049272	1050153	Damn you, Opera.
1050453	1052235	I mean, come on, finish the fucking thing.
1053068	1079795	whatever so they're working the kinks out they'll be updated I'm assuming for free everyone's assuming oh we're all going to have to pay for it in July or whatever I don't think so I think they're just going to update it and so look forward to that and then of course I think in January we're going to be getting the news channel which hopefully we'll have a way to sign up for different RSS feeds and stuff because I don't really give a shit about the world news but
1080643	1080983	Whatever.
1081984	1085286	Yeah, they're really trying to turn the Wii into the front page of Yahoo.
1086127	1090090	Well, what do you think, though, I mean, about the browser channel?
1090330	1091131	I think it's pretty good.
1091431	1096334	I'm glad it does support Flash, because you'll see a lot more from OLRWii.com.
1096995	1099096	I got some good plans for that.
1100457	1101038	Hurry, hurry.
1101498	1105761	And what's good, though, is it's definitely a lot easier to browse than, say, the PSP browser.
1105821	1106422	That's for sure.
1106942	1109304	I'm wondering how long it'll be before we actually...
1110143	1111324	And it's actually kind of weird.
1111364	1116648	It's a little bit easier to browse than the PS3 browser, too, because apparently their text entry sucks, too.
1118249	1120710	But I'm wondering how long it'll be before we see a 360 browser.
1120730	1123412	Because, you know, they've got to jump on the bandwagon.
1124493	1126214	I don't know.
1126474	1127055	It's pretty cool.
1127395	1129336	I know that the WiiCade stuff doesn't work too well.
1129376	1132839	Everyone was hoping that site would be good, but they have to downgrade all their games for Flash 7.
1133079	1133860	It was okay.
1134260	1135140	I checked some of it out.
1135160	1135681	It was okay.
1136181	1137762	Yeah, they're pretty fun, some of the games.
1138463	1138563	Um...
1139937	1140637	Thanks for watching!
1161644	1166647	Well, it's not tiny box, but when you're looking at a big widescreen TV, it doesn't take up a big portion of it.
1166687	1172531	So I kind of wish there was a way to make that stuff bigger because YouTube's a pretty awesome site to be looking at on the Wii.
1172591	1174232	I mean, you can get everybody in the living room.
1174553	1182338	And what I did is I created my own personal page finally on YouTube, and I've started bookmarking videos I really like, like the banana muffin, muffin, muffin, banana.
1183419	1184880	Our listeners are going to have no idea what I'm talking about.
1185180	1189443	But you can bookmark these videos and play them for people.
1189723	1190003	That's cool.
1190663	1193264	Alright, so, yeah, I like the Wii browser as well.
1193524	1203168	I'm looking forward to whatever you are able to come up with for olrwii.com, because olrpsp.com, that site's still getting, even though we haven't really done a lot of maintenance on it, it's still getting talked about.
1203448	1206670	It's still getting talked about, and, you know, it looks great on the PSP.
1206710	1208971	You did a really good job with that, so hats off to you.
1209611	1210952	Looking forward to seeing what you can do with the Wii.
1212452	1212832	Alright.
1212852	1212972	Really?
1212992	1216034	I can't help it.
1216114	1218195	Yes, we're looking forward to seeing what Matt can do with his Wii.
1220532	1222854	Let me talk also about some other Wii news.
1222874	1230300	A lot of folks are talking about Virtual Console, and I thought it was quite humorous that people thought Nintendo was going to throw them a free game at Christmas.
1230740	1231281	Well, I don't know.
1231301	1240708	I heard a rumor Sony's doing something similar, but I guess folks thought Nintendo was going to throw them Super Mario Bros., one of their biggest games, as a free game.
1241169	1245212	Which, you know, considering how many times we've had to buy Super Mario Bros.
1245252	1248595	and various, like the Game Boy one they had, and the
1249033	1251074	Super Nintendo 1 they had and all that crap.
1251395	1254296	You'd think they could give us it for free, but no.
1254737	1257098	It's coming out for 500 Wii Points on Christmas Day.
1257358	1266644	But also coming out, ToeJam & Earl, R-Type for the TurboGrafx-16, and Super Castlevania, which should be pretty awesome.
1266844	1267485	Street Fighter 2 also.
1267645	1270747	Street Fighter 2 as well, even though I don't really plan on checking that one out.
1270967	1271287	R-Type.
1271387	1272268	Yeah, you like R-Type?
1272508	1273208	Urban Champion.
1273789	1277551	On January 1st, you get Urban Champion and I think it was Baseball.
1278246	1281147	By the way, Urban Champion kind of sucks.
1282447	1291649	I know a lot of people think it might be cool because they haven't really heard of it, but keep in mind, this game was made before Double Dragon, before a lot of that other stuff.
1292009	1293029	Urban Champion kind of sucks.
1293150	1295230	It's not going to be worth the 500 points, I'm sorry to say.
1295270	1296210	We need bad dudes.
1296270	1299311	New Year's Day is kind of weak, but Christmas Day is very strong in releases.
1300074	1301976	Are you a bad enough dude to save the president?
1302116	1303737	Bad dudes would be awesome.
1303897	1304898	That's what they really need.
1304938	1306499	No, it sucked on the NES.
1306619	1308401	It totally sucked compared to the arcade.
1308441	1309582	It was a horrible game, but it was fun.
1309682	1311003	Did they make bad dudes on Genesis?
1311023	1312024	I don't know.
1312324	1312765	I can't remember.
1312785	1313165	I don't think so.
1313945	1316388	I thought they made it on another system besides just the Nintendo.
1317669	1317929	Oh, well.
1318249	1321652	So you have those releases to look forward to on Christmas.
1324314	1328958	Well, speaking of releases, as... Well, there are...
1329651	1332192	Some next week in the UK.
1333252	1334253	And by some, I mean three.
1335353	1337033	Of course, on the 25th, we have Wii Sports.
1337654	1337894	Duh.
1338754	1343956	On the 29th, we've got... What the hell retailer is going to be open on the 25th in the UK to sell Wii Sports?
1344996	1345896	Alright, whatever, whatever.
1346997	1347937	I'm like, yeah.
1348637	1354859	And then also, two PSP releases, Free Running and Lego Star Wars 2, the original trilogy.
1356220	1356460	On the 29th.
1357059	1360581	It makes sense, though, that it's a slow week in the UK because of the holiday and everything.
1360641	1362703	It's going to be pretty slow over here, too, right, Loki?
1363183	1365184	Yeah, it's extremely slow.
1366265	1368246	I want to say there's actually nothing coming out.
1368426	1370207	I'm pretty confident in that.
1370507	1373829	And if anything, it was just a crappy-ass DS game.
1374610	1377832	And I really mean crappy, like board game collection-type crappy.
1378673	1390701	Anyway, so, but we do have some exclusive release dates for you, and I'd like to touch on something I was talking about earlier in the show about how websites are carrying exclusive stories that certain games are coming out and that they have the first news on it.
1391442	1403049	There's actually a news piece that's being run by GoNintendo.com, which is actually originally covered on CodenameRevolution.com, talking about High School Musical being in development for the Wii.
1404490	1407212	In case you forgot, we did mention that back in episode 206,
1408914	1413917	Way back in the month of October, and gave you a release date of that as well.
1414458	1419121	And in case you haven't heard of that, I believe it's coming out in May.
1419401	1420241	But who cares?
1420321	1421922	It's High School Musical The Game.
1421962	1424224	I mean, I put this right up there with, like, happy feet.
1424804	1425245	Exactly.
1425365	1426706	It's a crappy game.
1426726	1428246	Can't you guys just kiss and make up?
1428307	1429667	It's really not worth fighting over.
1430108	1431348	No, it's worth fighting over.
1431689	1432669	Everything's worth fighting.
1434310	1438313	No, but seriously, so that's coming out, and, you know, great.
1438980	1442703	We did have a few other things, and some of these were mentioned during the week.
1442743	1448507	I had them posted in our show role, but during the week, more news came out, and we had some dates being released.
1448827	1456473	Of course, Prince of Persia Rival Swords for the Wii being announced by Ubisoft, and that's coming out March 14th.
1457473	1463418	What they didn't mention, though, is that Driver Parallel Lines will also be coming out on the Wii and the PSP.
1464318	1466200	That is also the same day on March 14th.
1467516	1472279	And a week prior, they're going to be releasing their game for the new Ninja Turtles movie.
1472939	1477862	And that's coming out on PlayStation 2, GameCube, 360, the Wii, the DS, and the Game Boy Advance.
1479243	1480864	And that's coming out on the 7th.
1481824	1487227	Also from Ubisoft, we've got a sequel to their really crappy Game Boy Advance game, Dogs.
1487408	1492050	Dogs 2, which is coming out on the 7th of March as well.
1492410	1496753	They have a music game coming out at the end of February called Guitar Hits for the PSP.
1497352	1498873	Dragon Ball Z, Shin Budokai, Another
1526181	1532405	for PSP, the follow-up of their Shin Budokai game, and that's coming out March 14th.
1533185	1549135	And then Dragon Ball Z Haru Kanaru, that's a very long name, Haru Kanaru Densetsu for the DS, and that's a mouthful right there.
1549855	1552176	That's coming out on the 21st of March.
1552557	1552937	And then
1553530	1554330	You're gonna love this.
1554490	1556451	Elder Scrolls Oblivion for the PlayStation 3.
1557492	1559953	Delayed yet again to the end of February.
1560053	1561513	Coming out now, February 27th.
1562914	1563514	What the hell?
1563814	1567636	Gee, where have I heard this Oblivion getting delayed for the new console thing before?
1567716	1569957	Where have I heard this before?
1570177	1570437	2006, maybe?
1571298	1572218	Yeah, seriously.
1573218	1574899	So, it's being delayed yet again.
1574919	1578461	I don't know why they don't have it done yet, but whatever.
1579021	1579141	So.
1580808	1581169	That's it.
1581329	1583810	Well, thanks for the exclusive look at some of the U.S.
1583910	1584111	news.
1584871	1587333	Nobody else has mentioned that whole Oblivion getting delayed thing, huh?
1587773	1588413	No, no.
1588674	1592376	But I'm sure a few months from now they'll mention, oh, by the way, it's been delayed.
1592656	1597439	We have the exclusive news on it because everyone seems to ignore us.
1597860	1598260	That's fine.
1598280	1601082	We're not a real legitimate site because we don't have game in our title.
1601282	1601402	Nope.
1602820	1612265	Coming out in Japan, also kind of slim pickings in Japan this week, but you do get the Japanese version of Prey on the 360 this week on December 28th.
1612745	1617328	Also on the PlayStation 3, you're going to get Formula 1 Championship Edition coming out there.
1618228	1622510	Coming to the Nintendo Wii, you get, not a lot, you get a new memory card there.
1623811	1630394	Coming to the PlayStation 2, you get Formula 1 2006, Unimishi, and Himihibi Princess Days.
1631135	1632636	Does that sound like a title you're interested in playing?
1633036	1633316	DarkSakura?
1633336	1634456	That actually sounds kind of cute.
1634837	1635397	Sounds kind of cute.
1635697	1646842	Coming for the Nintendo DS, we have just a bunch of accessories, some pens, some covers, and an Animal Crossing mascot strap, and a carrying bag for Animal Crossing.
1647362	1647582	Hmm.
1648002	1648903	Sounds like it might be kind of fun.
1649163	1657287	You do get Dragon Quest monsters, though, on the DS, which is, you know, Dragon Quest games are always pretty big deals over there in Japan, even though this is, you know, it's a spin-off game still.
1657707	1658347	Gonna be pretty big.
1659237	1661018	And that's really all I have.
1661859	1662339	Not a whole lot.
1662359	1663240	It's a slow week over there, too.
1663260	1668243	And as I was going to say, the High School Musical game, I said May, because I was just completely pulling it out of the top of my head.
1668263	1674326	But I looked back in the show role for episode 206, and apparently it was July 11th.
1674546	1676007	May was Pirates of the Caribbean 3.
1676628	1677988	Let it go, Jesus.
1679069	1680990	Hey, I've got to get my information correct, okay?
1681010	1682271	Just in case.
1682311	1683432	Fair enough, fair enough.
1684292	1684632	Anyways.
1685012	1687574	Now that we're moving on from our angst, aren't we?
1688106	1689107	I think so, yeah.
1717932	1722576	The best news about this is that I won't have to buy some fucking cable to do it like you had to do on the GameCube.
1722616	1727940	Remember, the first cable you could connect to your Advance or whatever, but then it didn't work with the Advance SP.
1728361	1728761	Nope, it didn't.
1728781	1729762	It was so annoying.
1730262	1730843	So annoying.
1730943	1731703	Damn you, Nintendo.
1731723	1732624	I'm still mad at you over that.
1732664	1734285	That's why I still held onto my GBA.
1734646	1742712	Because I have to tell you what I want to see come out again is the Pac-Man Plus or Pac-Man Versus.
1743053	1743733	Oh, Pac-Man Versus.
1743773	1747076	Yeah, that would actually be a really fun download title for the Wii, wouldn't it?
1747748	1753590	I actually, we still randomly play that game because it's just fantastic.
1753710	1754731	I mean, it was such a fun idea.
1755031	1765354	Well, also, I think about, you know, they should really give Four Swords another chance because I think a lot of people didn't get into Four Swords on the GameCube because of the fact you had to have, all these people had to have an advance and all these people had to have the cables.
1765734	1767675	And it wasn't usually hard to find people with an advance.
1767695	1770996	It was hard to find people with the cables to play the game with.
1771156	1772237	Same thing with Crystal Chronicles.
1772277	1775878	I think we actually have two or three sets of cables at my house just because of that.
1776189	1778030	Yeah, but you're a nerd.
1778591	1782573	Well, I mean, it was just that we ended up, you know, Dan worked at GameStop at the time.
1782593	1783354	We found him cheap.
1784294	1785175	We'd just hold on to him.
1785215	1790979	But it was really, I think, in that respect, though, it's, hey, we make it require this.
1791059	1792320	We can sell more stuff.
1793501	1794501	So, I don't know.
1795302	1806009	I'm really, really hoping that we get not just, you know, like the one or two ones that were out before, but get a whole series of games that interact between the Wii and the DS.
1807517	1808298	I could really go for that.
1808518	1809899	Any ideas how they could do that, Loki?
1810739	1813821	How they could get more games to interact with both systems?
1815242	1826608	Well, probably just... They'll probably start adding it on kind of like they did with the Game Boy Advance stuff, you know, where, like, remember Metroid Prime, where you could download the original Metroid to it and stuff like that.
1827788	1829709	They'll probably start with gimmicky stuff like that.
1830049	1833071	Hopefully, maybe the new Animal Crossing will allow you to download some games.
1833191	1833872	Dream on!
1834792	1836373	Actually, I have an idea.
1837276	1840579	They should be able to turn your Wii into a demo station.
1841340	1843462	Yeah, that's been a long time rumor.
1843502	1846625	I remember nobody's ever seen if that's really going to happen.
1846645	1849647	But yeah, the rumor was you'd be able to download DS demos through your Wii.
1850028	1852210	Just like you're supposed to be able to do PSP demos through the PS3.
1852350	1857074	But if an Animal Crossing were to come out on Wii, that means that we'd probably get the island back.
1857194	1857855	That should be fun.
1859298	1861179	I think everybody's waiting for Animal Crossing on the Wii.
1861239	1861699	I don't know.
1861719	1866280	I'm a little skeptical this time because I was so excited about Animal Crossing on the DS.
1866300	1869541	I was so excited about it and then played it for like two weeks and then I was done.
1869701	1870981	I think you should have a Mii game.
1871722	1879404	You know, you make your Mii on your Wii and download your Mii to the DS with a little thing like sub-games.
1880724	1881844	I guess anything is possible.
1882345	1882965	Anything's possible.
1883545	1883825	I don't know.
1884471	1894119	But one thing that they're probably not going to have in Animal Crossing is the Wiimote throwing game, because they've been getting a lot of heat over the whole Wiimote strap thing.
1894499	1905508	In fact, of course, as I predicted last week, immediately the next day, Class Action Lawsuit filed for the stupid Wii strap things, and of course... He's so humble, isn't he?
1906769	1911092	Hey, I mean, I'm not taking credit for that, because anybody could have guessed that, that's just...
1911513	1912633	That's just stupid.
1912794	1916495	I mean, of course it was coming because people were looking to profit from all this stuff.
1917175	1925999	So, some company, Greenwelling LLP, filed a national class action lawsuit on behalf of the owners of Nintendo Wii.
1926139	1931621	Thank you, them, because, you know, all these Wii owners are in dire need of some money.
1931641	1932442	No, you know what?
1932702	1933722	You don't represent me.
1934082	1937844	I am a Nintendo Wii owner since launch day, and you don't represent me.
1939124	1940505	Let that be known on this program.
1941613	1946756	Anyway, so you need to say I represent Wii owners except Rob Pomorin's Lounge Radio.
1946856	1947156	And me.
1948077	1948277	And me.
1948297	1950578	You should just say you represent stupid people.
1950758	1958203	They said that basically the class action lawsuit rose as a result of the defective nature of the Wii remotes.
1959363	1970730	Basically saying that the wrist straps were not strong enough to withstand the use of the player and that Nintendo did not include enough
1971457	1974440	instruction on how to use the Wii Remote properly.
1974760	1975080	What?
1975221	1976201	Oh, my God.
1976442	1978043	I want to shove a Wii Remote up their butt.
1978063	1978964	That's a retard.
1979184	1979585	I'm sorry.
1979605	1980646	No, no, no.
1980686	1981967	That's insulting to retarded people.
1982567	1983548	That's just an idiot.
1984529	1984970	I'm sorry.
1985830	1986551	I can't deal with that.
1987412	1997281	And that it's basically, you know, what they're saying, though, and they're looking to do is the class action lawsuit is going to basically correct
1997876	2004632	They want to correct the defect in the Wii Remote and provide a refund to the purchase or replace the defective Wii Remotes.
2008840	2012783	I think they're trying to also claim damages for stuff that people have done.
2012923	2015905	I can't help but think, though, that they've sent out emails.
2016145	2019367	There's a stupid indicator in the front of all the games.
2019447	2021448	It's built into the games, for God's sake.
2021608	2022549	Built into the consoles.
2022689	2024850	On every single game, this is the Wii strap thing.
2025290	2028192	They've offered this free replacement program.
2028252	2030814	If you want to replace your Wii straps, they'll do it for free.
2031855	2032255	They've...
2032887	2039673	Told you in the instruction manuals do not swing wildly, and you don't need to swing wildly, and the commercials don't show them swinging wildly.
2040714	2043617	Granted, they show them diving across the couch, but that's not swinging wildly.
2043657	2044878	That's just acting like an idiot.
2046997	2059963	Well, I think the best comparison I heard about that, though, was that, like, you know, in a commercial for a new car, they show them driving in the wilderness doing all these stunts, and they always have that little thing, you know, professional driver on closed course, do not attempt, that whole thing, right?
2060343	2063104	And you know that you don't do that with a regular car.
2063524	2064305	You just know that.
2064465	2066626	Common sense tells you that, right?
2066886	2073929	Common sense tells you if you dive across the couch, you're likely to break the couch or a lamp or your Wiimote, but that's the risk you take.
2074189	2075810	It had warnings, right?
2076792	2079173	They've made the warnings abundant.
2079453	2081915	Three words, idiot.
2082815	2088518	Well, it just comes down to Nintendo, of course, said this is, you know, without merit that they've done everything.
2088578	2096682	Basically, reinstating what we just said about, you know, the Wii and that they've given way more than enough, you know, precautions and stuff.
2097222	2097962	And people are stupid.
2098062	2099123	It's just like, you know...
2100636	2109141	You don't see lawsuits out there for people throwing baseball bats and hitting somebody with them and them suing the baseball bat company because they're stupid and let go of the bat.
2109321	2110622	They know they're not supposed to do that.
2111022	2126450	Well, just like you know you're not supposed to swing the remote like a 90-mile-an-hour fastball, and just because your hands became slippery... Well, you know, if I had a knife and my hands were slippery and I accidentally stabbed someone with the knife, it's my old damn fault, not the knife company, because they made their knives sharp.
2127891	2128151	It's just...
2128607	2135512	It's really dumb, and I hope to God that they have somebody out there that sees this case and throws it out of court.
2137073	2139534	Didn't they say this might go to jury trial, or that's what they want?
2139594	2141015	Is they want a jury trial out of this?
2141556	2156746	Well, I think the lawsuit was... No, wait, that was the one for the Xbox 360, where they were seeking $5 million for... They haven't really said a number that they're looking to get yet, but from what we've seen so far, the Wii straps breaking has been...
2157754	2159414	Relatively rare.
2159714	2165236	I mean, it's happened, but people post it on the internet, and so it seems like a bigger problem than it actually is.
2166556	2169836	And a lot of these we found out as of last week that are faked.
2170277	2174697	So, I mean, I just see this as just them trying to profit off of it.
2174717	2175938	Let's take the fakers to court.
2175998	2177438	Nintendo ought to sue all the fakers.
2178418	2179038	That would be funny.
2179598	2180639	Well, that does make sense.
2180699	2182439	Technically, it's perjury.
2184175	2184595	There you go.
2184936	2188699	It's basically... I say if Nintendo loses money on this, they take those fakers to court.
2189600	2190260	That would be funny.
2190921	2191441	Defamation.
2191822	2192462	Defamation suit.
2194124	2194764	I think that would be funny.
2194984	2195285	All right.
2196486	2199629	Now, real quick, I want to say, though, speaking of lawsuits, did you hear about that?
2199649	2209017	I know this is going to sound completely random, but did you hear about that trillion-dollar lawsuit that the RIAA filed against that Russian MP3 company that was selling all of MP3.com or whatever that site is?
2210606	2211086	Do you hear about that?
2211186	2212627	It's like one of the biggest lawsuits ever.
2212667	2216628	Trillions of dollars, like $1.6 trillion lawsuit or something like that.
2216948	2218709	There was another study I read.
2218749	2231013	I don't even remember exactly what it was, but it was something that they were saying that these claims, the damages that are being caused by the downloads are a lot, I mean, which is obvious, are a lot less than what these companies are seeking for.
2231773	2238736	And that, you know, really the people downloading these MP3s are not really causing that much damage to them.
2239855	2244697	All this news about lawsuits, I don't know about you guys, but news about stupid lawsuits makes me very angry.
2244757	2245657	Does it make you angry?
2246537	2247557	Everything makes me angry.
2247617	2249198	You know what happens when we get angry?
2250018	2251018	People die.
2259061	2260441	The FUs of the week time.
2260561	2262562	DarkSakura, what's pissing you off this week?
2263262	2267223	FU to mucus and the extreme amounts of it that live in my lungs.
2268419	2269660	and MakeMeSickEveryMorning.
2270560	2271460	I hate bronchitis.
2271820	2276122	I hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it.
2276142	2278383	I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate you!
2279464	2280104	Remember Kefka?
2280424	2280904	Oh, forget it.
2280924	2281144	Yes.
2281585	2282305	Yes, I remember.
2283185	2292709	But, um, I'd also like to just offer an F you to, uh, Tower Video for not having any Doctor Who DVDs before they, uh, went out of business.
2292729	2292909	Loki?
2294330	2294550	Loki?
2295206	2308178	I'm pissed off at the lack of Wii games that are out there that are good Wii games because, you know, I'm really, I'm kind of searching for some more stuff to play and I bought a lot of stuff and I have to say about, you know, 60% of it's been crap.
2308659	2310961	And it's just, it's not because, you know...
2312794	2313855	I picked a crappy game.
2314596	2318359	Haven't you played damn near every launch title now except like Happy Feet and Avatar?
2318379	2325585	Well, I haven't played like any of the, you know, Happy Feet, Avatar, Spongebob, you know, that stuff that's ports off of old games like Ant Bully and stuff.
2326005	2337915	But I've played, you know, quite a bit of everything and a lot of it's really crappy and I'm starting to get a little afraid that, you know, maybe this launch for the Wii wasn't as good as everyone's saying it was because...
2338530	2339091	Thank you for watching!
2347626	2349548	It was a lot better than this stuff.
2349588	2353431	But, I mean, to be fair, the games that were good on Wii were really good.
2353611	2354652	Like, you know, Zelda.
2355172	2358315	I thought Excite Truck was pretty damn good, especially for a launch title.
2358675	2360837	Trauma Center, fucking amazing.
2361077	2362398	Especially if you haven't played the DS one.
2362498	2365721	Here's the thing it's coming down to is because Excite Truck is really good.
2365741	2366942	It's like, yeah, that's awesome.
2367302	2368643	I want to find another game like this.
2369304	2369604	Oh, wait.
2370239	2371100	Thank you for watching!
2391547	2395890	There is a drought in games, and it's like three games coming out in the next two months.
2396290	2397891	I'm sorry, they need more than this.
2397911	2402253	Don't you expect that there's going to be a drought in January, February for every system?
2402473	2403994	What do the other systems have coming?
2404174	2405115	The other systems?
2405655	2408337	360's got Lost Planet, which is a pretty large title.
2409498	2411339	Well, Battlestation's Midway, which is shit.
2411779	2413260	And Fusion Frenzy.
2413740	2419483	And then PlayStation 3 doesn't have shit coming out for it, but PlayStation 3 didn't have shit coming out for it at launch either.
2420204	2420264	Um...
2420834	2421574	And then PlayStation 2.
2421875	2423736	I mean, January, granted, is a slow month.
2424076	2426817	But February does have a lot of stuff coming out for other systems.
2426897	2427738	A lot of big titles.
2428478	2430759	And the Wii is just kind of being skipped.
2431600	2431900	All right.
2433497	2443181	My FUs of the week, I don't really have a lot, so FU to cookies for being so tempting and straying me from my diet this holiday season.
2443401	2448803	Because I've gotten so many yummy cookies, like, you know, Loki and Nelly made me some for Christmas that were very good.
2448983	2451284	No offense, I mean, the cookies were great, it's just too tempting.
2451604	2457106	And then some of my students at work made me cookies, and oh gosh, it's too much, too much to handle.
2458986	2460147	Let's get back into some news.
2461808	2468009	It's funny that you brought this up, but it was talked about this week, the whole delays for Wii games.
2468309	2475091	There was some news going on that Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime could possibly be delayed all the way to Christmas.
2475831	2484553	But then, of course, Reggie Fils-Aimé discussed with Newsweek not that long ago, he made a promise, Nintendo would not have the launch problems they have with usual consoles.
2484913	2490698	Quote, Metroid Prime 3 which is a from the ground up creation of Metroid for the Wii system will come out in early 2007.
2490758	2497865	This gives us fantastic momentum coming off the launch and will certainly be an example of how there will be no new game drought for this system.
2498345	2506313	Another from the ground up Wii game that we are strategically timing to launch to make sure we are continuing driving momentum through 2007 is Super Mario Galaxy.
2506813	2511055	You know, and they really are doing a good job keeping games coming out.
2511195	2524700	Nintendo is, you know, because they've got WarioWare for January, We Play for February, Mario Party 8 for March, I mean, and that's already, you know, the first quarter of the year, and they've got a game coming out every month.
2525060	2529422	Can't say the same for other companies, though, because... So it's the third parties that have to pick it up.
2529682	2531103	But is it still kind of new, maybe?
2531795	2532615	Maybe.
2532815	2535317	And third parties have their development cycles, you know.
2535677	2537277	March, you're going to see a ton of games come out.
2537337	2541539	And remember how Nintendo wasn't letting a lot of them online at first?
2541599	2542199	That's stupid.
2542219	2543240	That could be part of it, too.
2543520	2545781	Nintendo needs to fucking get a clue.
2546101	2547302	Online's where it is now.
2547822	2548382	And you know what?
2548422	2550783	People were really excited about the online for the DS.
2550823	2552724	And I thought, okay, because they saw that.
2553456	2555137	Let's take that as an example.
2555358	2556999	Get this fucking console online.
2557920	2563524	This Mii Channel, exchanging Miis and exchanging messages shit, it's old.
2564105	2564825	It's old already.
2565826	2568068	We need some more online games.
2568396	2570138	It needs some actual good support for the online.
2586468	2590890	Metroid at some point, Super Mario World on Super Nintendo.
2591211	2595093	Those types of games will be strategically planned for when there's a drought of big Wii games.
2595333	2595573	Great.
2595593	2597614	You know what you need to do with those virtual console games?
2597834	2601196	You need to put them online like they do with Xbox Live Arcade games.
2601536	2603317	Put them so that you can play multiplayer online.
2603677	2610341	Maybe not exactly is how they're doing it because the Xbox Live Arcade games have had a little bit of problems with some of the online components of them, but
2611403	2613544	Multiplayer Online with Mario Kart.
2613944	2615184	I mean, that's going to be awesome.
2615345	2619226	Of course, they probably wouldn't want to compete with their new Mario Kart whenever the fuck that's coming out.
2620206	2626909	You could really add a lot of oomph to some of these old crap titles like Baseball, Tennis, Mario Brothers.
2626929	2627909	Well, I shouldn't say it's crap.
2627949	2629650	I mean, they all contributed to history.
2629670	2630830	Leaderboards, at least.
2630890	2637553	Yeah, you could really add a lot of oomph to these games and really justify the $5 price with these little enhancements.
2638353	2639153	I think.
2639313	2640414	It's not asking that much.
2640494	2640694	I mean,
2642132	2648143	Well, you know, I'm sure there's a huge technical aspect when it comes to lag and all that stuff, but, you know, whatever.
2648944	2652991	Well... Excuse me for a moment while my voice fills me.
2653712	2653893	Well...
2654637	2659961	There are a few rumors floating about, and one that I know a lot of people would really, really like to see.
2661583	2671991	There are talks actually from EGM in the January issue stating that Katamari Damacy would be coming out on the Wii and Xbox Live Arcade.
2673292	2677515	I'm sort of not sure how it would work on the Wii, if you'd do it like Monkey Ball.
2678056	2678916	Probably like Monkey Ball.
2678996	2680077	Yeah.
2680758	2683300	But Xbox Live, though, it would definitely...
2684231	2685872	It's a good idea, I think, for Xbox Live.
2686113	2689595	I'm worried about the size limitation on Xbox Live, though, with 50 megs.
2689615	2691577	Well, I guess the graphics ain't all that.
2692137	2692958	I don't know, okay.
2693398	2698762	I loaded my copy onto my HD loader, and it wasn't that big.
2699703	2700584	I'd have to check it again.
2700624	2707489	Well, I'm hearing the rumors that they're going to up the live limit because the new memory card's coming out, the 256 megs.
2707789	2711532	I think the 50 meg limit's stupid anyways, and to be honest, I...
2712288	2715210	So you can't download a live arcade game to your memory card.
2715531	2717012	Boo fucking hoo.
2717152	2717672	Who cares?
2717792	2719113	Get a goddamn hard drive.
2719453	2720454	Or don't use that part of it.
2720494	2723597	Just use your fucking memory card for saves, and that is it.
2724197	2725038	We don't even do that.
2725078	2725878	We just use a hard drive.
2725898	2731042	Yeah, the only thing I use memory cards for, downloading content from kiosks, and I don't even do that anymore.
2731062	2732984	Didn't We Heart Katamari have a two-player mode?
2733104	2733684	It did, didn't it?
2733724	2733964	It did.
2733984	2735846	Yeah, so could you imagine having that on the Xbox?
2735866	2736606	Add cooperative and versus.
2736626	2738328	Well, the... The original one did too.
2738428	2739328	The originals did too.
2739348	2739909	That's right.
2740549	2741270	It was kind of a...
2742622	2744282	I like co-op mode better for Katamari.
2744342	2755904	It wasn't, you know, it wasn't like, you know, it's no Halo, Gears of War style multiplayer that, you know, keeps people coming back, but it's a nice addition, you know, makes it a little something special.
2756744	2758125	That would be kind of fun on Xbox Live.
2758285	2762325	I would love to see, you know... I'd much rather play Katamari and Mashi co-op than Gears of War, I'm sorry.
2762345	2768426	I'd love to see the Wii version have your Miis as, like, the little, you know, characters running around in the levels and stuff.
2768546	2769107	That'd be funny.
2769407	2770707	Oh, getting to roll over your friends?
2770907	2771127	Yeah.
2771147	2771567	That'd be fun.
2772199	2773200	That would be really cool.
2773580	2777563	Or they should do like a... Or the massive people in your Mii parade.
2779385	2785429	Or they should do like a convert an existing Mii into a little prince cousin.
2785449	2786170	A little prince face.
2786290	2786490	Maybe.
2786510	2788752	That'd be fun.
2789212	2790413	I think that would be good.
2790433	2792014	They have a lot of things that they can do with that.
2792134	2794036	And hopefully they'll actually use all that.
2794336	2796037	And of course, Loki will be all about the achievements.
2797098	2797779	Fuck that shit.
2798399	2799720	Yes, it will be all about the achievements.
2801382	2801962	No, but anyways.
2802461	2813729	Speaking of the 360, the 360 owners got a pretty cool surprise recently as Microsoft has upped their warranty from 90 days to one whole year.
2814750	2822075	So if your console happens to be broken, or if it was broken, you're going to be getting a refund for your broken console.
2822115	2823495	So that is pretty awesome.
2824216	2830720	And definitely, at least they're supporting their hardware with the issues that they may have for it.
2831261	2831441	Yeah.
2831977	2832618	Go Microsoft!
2855737	2864482	Well, this song, of course, is in Luminous 2 on the PSP, and it was just released for download on iTunes this week, so you can check that out by the Genki Rockets.
2865083	2865463	Heavenly Star
2893366	2896487	I really like this song, ever since the video was posted back in the day.
2921232	2921872	Thanks for watching!
2946189	2950233	and the Black Eyed Peas, Pump It song and Missy Elliott, Lose Control.
2950253	2952535	That's a great one to play Luminous to.
2952575	2952995	I'm sorry.
2953015	2954716	They had some pretty fun choices.
2954796	2957319	For the benefit of our listeners, I'm staring blankly at Rob.
2957479	2957939	Whatever.
2958600	2959701	Then go to the next story.
2959901	2960802	I don't listen to any of that.
2961402	2962123	Go to the next story.
2963144	2969449	Well, you know how we were saying that Metal Gear, not just we, I mean a bunch of people were saying Metal Gear Solid 4 was going to be multi-platform?
2970129	2971110	It was a rumor last week.
2971130	2971411	It was a rumor.
2971431	2971871	It was a rumor.
2972863	2979925	Well, an inside source at Konami is not really that reliable.
2980885	2986626	They've come out saying that it's going to be definitely exclusive for PS3.
2986846	2990987	At this time is the key word, or words I should say.
2992187	2993747	So they left themselves an out.
2993947	2994768	It's at this time.
2994868	2996648	It's just like they said, you know, what was it...
2998067	3005873	Back when, well, when I pointed out when they brought, you know, their version of the story that Splinter Cell was coming out on the PS3 as well.
3006713	3011597	And, you know, they said, oh, we had no plans of this coming out on the PlayStation 3 at this time.
3011637	3014559	And then next week they announced, oh, it's coming out on the PlayStation 3.
3014999	3015740	Oh, no, it wasn't that.
3015820	3016460	It was, um...
3018191	3019772	Virtual Fighter V, that's what it was.
3020553	3028117	They were doing an interview for that, and that was a PlayStation 3 exclusive, and then this week, you know, 360, so... I'm going to say something uncharacteristic for me.
3028978	3031960	I don't really think any other system can do the game justice but PS3.
3032840	3033281	Interesting.
3033321	3033981	What makes you say that?
3034261	3035402	Playing Resistance Fall of Man.
3037223	3038284	You don't think they could do it on 360?
3038324	3039405	What is it?
3039605	3042247	They could do it, but it would not do it justice.
3042387	3042467	It...
3043502	3049105	With everything that I've seen that they want to do with Metal Gear Solid 4, they're going to need the extra processing power.
3049765	3051186	They're really going to need it.
3053226	3063711	I've played a bunch of stuff on Xbox 360 and it all comes out really pretty, but I honestly, just doing comparisons for several of the games, I think the PS3 is going to be the better platform for the game anyway.
3063971	3065712	I guarantee you this will be out on the 360.
3067093	3069274	Not day and date, but it will be out on the 360.
3071229	3072310	I'm going to have it on PS3.
3072490	3072970	It doesn't matter.
3073170	3073670	Interesting.
3075311	3078473	I never really got into Metal Gear past the old NES ones.
3078573	3079414	I mean, I don't know.
3079454	3080675	I somehow missed that boat.
3080795	3082556	And I know I'm weird for missing it.
3082576	3084277	Rob, do you believe that love can bloom on a battlefield?
3084477	3084817	Shut up.
3084997	3087439	They basically, it's all about money.
3087579	3088119	That's what it is.
3088319	3091221	The PlayStation 3 has 200,000 units out there.
3091721	3093142	Or say, okay, by the end of...
3094344	3097607	What if the PS3 suddenly takes off between this and Final Fantasy XIII?
3123166	3124126	and it will be made on the 360.
3125326	3134388	Just because they're, you know, exclusive right now, you know, they do, Sony does pay them for exclusive rights to some of these games and so it, after a certain amount of time.
3134608	3139409	But, but, but, the Xbox 360 does not have six axis.
3140850	3143190	Yeah, and the PlayStation 3 doesn't have rumble.
3147351	3148511	Such flimsy controllers.
3149351	3151792	Anyways, so, you know, great.
3152712	3152892	Um,
3154326	3161269	And speaking of the PlayStation 3, somebody's actually in talks with Amazon for their movie download service.
3161989	3167472	And, you know, because PlayStation 3, they're starting to kind of get into the more, you know, downloads and everything.
3167532	3175395	And I got to admit, they do have some pretty good stuff on their network service right now as far as, you know, like the equivalence to live arcade games.
3175496	3180098	You know, especially they're getting that Gran Turismo HD demo, which is not bad for free.
3181158	3182138	I got to admit, that's pretty cool.
3182939	3183119	And...
3184222	3193106	Now they're talking about going the same way as the 360 and offering movie downloads, which this isn't a big surprise because it's Sony and they want it to be this media center type thing.
3194026	3201969	So of course they're talking with Amazon because they have their digital download service as well and probably going to hook up with them on that.
3203149	3206591	But I see this probably happening, especially with the PSP.
3206671	3208572	I think they have their download service as well.
3209992	3211953	So what does this mean for UMDs?
3212947	3214228	This doesn't mean anything for UMDs.
3214288	3217210	It means that people are going to be downloading videos to the PlayStation 3.
3217410	3222894	UMDs are going to be like UMDs, meaning they're going to be out there, but they're not going to sell.
3223375	3226917	Is this to compete with 360's new little marketplace movie thingy?
3227097	3227457	Definitely.
3227518	3229879	Which I still don't like because they don't have enough HD movies.
3230099	3231500	They have like five.
3231520	3233102	I count five or six HD movies.
3233122	3233402	That's it.
3233882	3238806	It's literally going to be to compete with that, and it's also going to be to compete with iTunes.
3239506	3240727	That's exactly what it's for.
3240747	3241908	All right.
3242589	3245371	Well, something else to be competitive in the movie world.
3245772	3252918	Ken Kutaragi has spoken with Impress, that's a magazine over in Japan, about an AV-centric PlayStation 3.
3254099	3264807	This would have the cell processor powering and would, quote, be a standard AV component-sized box with a more powerful power supply unit, anti-shake insulator, and twice the main memory.
3265067	3269311	And then it also goes on to talk about dual HDMI output for this high-end system.
3269651	3277113	Now, this is kind of similar to the PSX, which was a version of the PlayStation 2, but it was just very expensive.
3277394	3283495	I guess you can kind of compare it to, you know, like the Panasonic Q was like an AV machine, but it also played GameCube games.
3283856	3287457	So it's not necessarily that he's talking about, you know, replacing the PlayStation 3 already.
3288037	3290578	But to me, it does seem a little early to be talking about this.
3290918	3291178	To me.
3291958	3294979	And it's also... It's like, make your PlayStation 3s.
3295419	3299380	Well, the dual HDMI out, that was originally what they were talking about for the original PlayStation 3.
3299440	3302922	Then, apparently, that was a little crazy.
3303162	3310064	And also the same with... Well, actually, I remember the dual HDMI out for the PlayStation 3 was for multiple monitors.
3310084	3313705	Remember, they said that if you had two HDTVs, who would have this?
3314065	3319447	Sitting next to each other, you could extend your desktop to be on both of them for...
3320612	3321353	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3348414	3351316	and buy a PlayStation 3 and still do it cheaper than this.
3352817	3353677	It's just stupid.
3353997	3357239	And the other thing, too, they're saying normal component size.
3357780	3361001	Well, that PlayStation 3 is not small by any means.
3361222	3364103	It is already normal component size, if not larger.
3364644	3368786	I mean, so what's the size of this power brick thing going to be?
3368826	3370307	I mean, is it going to be the size of, like,
3371161	3372182	A TV or something?
3372202	3374683	I mean, seriously, what are they talking about for this stuff?
3375083	3376924	I think this is still a ways out, whatever it is.
3377064	3379626	I think they need to shut him up, is what they need to do.
3379866	3384348	Because he's just spouting off retardedness as time goes on.
3384549	3387810	He really, he doesn't have a grip on reality.
3388091	3390972	Alright, well we issued a challenge to our listeners last week.
3391052	3396715	If you think the Sony spokespeople have no clue what they're doing in the marketing department, create your own Sony ad.
3396755	3399437	And we invited folks to leave us a voicemail on our Skype line.
3399755	3401256	Hi, I'm Sony's new spokesperson, Paradox Vincent.
3401276	3401937	Now look,
3428254	3434297	The PS3's been getting a lot of rap, but I think that it's really just all miscommunication, you know?
3435078	3440841	You gamer people just don't understand the way the business works, so I'm here to clear some things up.
3441481	3444103	The biggest complaint we've heard is the price.
3444583	3447925	Too cheap, I know, but there's nothing we can do about that now.
3448925	3450886	Secondly, some people say it freezes.
3451387	3455389	We're putting freezing technology in, so that people can really get a feel
3455899	3459540	for the true next generation look and feel on your 1080i television.
3460620	3467442	To really feel like you're driving that car, like you're shooting that alien, or how you're in that giant robot.
3468223	3472304	We want you to feel like you're a ninja or whatever, stabbing the giant enemy crab.
3472924	3473824	We get it, you know?
3474444	3478185	We understand that some people might not have HDTV.
3478666	3482347	In fact, a great number of people don't have HDTV.
3484204	3486745	Especially not 1080i HDTV.
3487305	3487926	We don't care.
3488386	3489166	Leave us alone.
3489606	3490547	I'm not hearing you.
3491027	3492368	La la, la la la la la.
3493528	3495229	La la, you're stupid.
3496209	3498470	All in all, it's the perfect gaming console.
3498951	3499351	I know.
3500051	3501232	The Wii's a pedophile.
3501692	3504993	And the Xbox 360 takes pictures of you while you're sleeping.
3505493	3507974	Would you pay $600 for a pedophile?
3508375	3509135	Or a pervert?
3509755	3510576	Or a terrorist?
3511516	3511976	I wouldn't.
3512817	3513637	Make the right move.
3514707	3515788	Make the Sony move.
3530422	3531363	Good job, Paradox Vincent.
3531383	3534705	We're going to send you some random things from our OLR prize pool.
3535025	3537587	I know we have a DDR Extreme 2 bundle.
3537927	3538928	Yes, that's Extreme 2.
3539008	3539928	That's last year's game.
3539948	3545332	But hey, those DDR pads are not easy to come by, so you get a bundle there and some other stuff as well.
3545352	3547113	I think there's a DS game we have to give away, too.
3547133	3549995	Don't we have a copy of Tau or something that's got to get given away at some point?
3550015	3550335	I don't know.
3550555	3551336	We'll have to see what's in the box.
3551356	3551816	You'll see.
3552357	3553677	You'll find out what you get when you get it.
3554078	3554378	All right.
3555479	3556499	What a great contest.
3557440	3558801	You get to win something.
3558821	3558901	Yeah.
3560576	3563619	A thing, a random... Think of it as Santa Claus coming to your house.
3563739	3564800	Something's better than nothing.
3564840	3566582	Something random from Orange Lounge Radio.
3566602	3567243	We'll be in touch.
3567743	3569405	You win stuff here.
3569745	3571006	More contests to come.
3571026	3574089	We'll probably do something next week, so stay tuned to Orange Lounge Radio.
3574630	3576872	Well, I have some news, and this makes me happy.
3578073	3579094	Remember Loco Roco?
3579774	3580355	Why, yes, I do.
3580695	3581476	It's getting a sequel.
3582737	3583458	That's kind of a given.
3584573	3587814	You mean one of the only PSP games people talked about a lot this year?
3588094	3588814	Getting a sequel?
3589154	3589774	No way!
3589834	3594115	Well, it was announced by Phil Harrison to MTV News.
3594375	3605897	Now, this makes me think, though, that quite possibly, I don't know, given that LocoRoco sort of flopped in Japan, I'm wondering if they're going to have a more limited release there than they will here.
3606197	3608157	I can just hear, I can see the interview now.
3608637	3610158	Yeah, we're doing a sequel to LocoRoco.
3610398	3612078	I don't like any of those Mexican games.
3615421	3616542	Jamey sees a penis in everything.
3616562	3617102	I do not.
3640903	3642824	I bet you wish you were in Second Life this week.
3642864	3650526	I know we didn't get around to that story, but there was some chick that was being interviewed in Second Life, and all these penises flew by on the screen like people threw dicks at her.
3653147	3654848	And I was thinking, hmm, Jamie should see this.
3655268	3660430	I actually tried downloading Second Life, because, again, it was my fandom that inspired me.
3660870	3663471	Someone freaking made a TARDIS on Second Life.
3664131	3664831	You nerd.
3665191	3675153	Well, it's not fully extra-dimensional like the actual one, but they had it all laid out, and they had the current one, and then they had the Tom Baker-era one in the different rooms and stuff.
3675173	3675714	I thought that was cool.
3676354	3680975	And then I played Second Life for five minutes, and then I was like, this game sucks.
3683235	3683695	Anyways.
3684656	3688356	Yeah, Second Life, I don't get it.
3689797	3690217	Anyways.
3691377	3692137	New Kingdom Hearts.
3692738	3693878	Speaking of Jamie fandom.
3693898	3694058	Yay!
3697318	3698959	I'm sure this is news to everybody.
3699579	3701419	They're making another Kingdom Hearts game.
3702640	3703800	That's a shocker.
3704220	3704880	Shocker.
3705260	3705780	Why?
3706661	3708061	Why would they do something like this?
3708261	3710262	It's not like the last game sold millions or anything.
3710922	3713423	So yeah, they're making a new Kingdom Hearts game, Kingdom Hearts 3.
3715043	3726046	And of course, this was sort of announced on the trailer that they had for Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix during their Jump Festa show in Tokyo.
3727169	3729690	and basically saying that a new project was in the works.
3730070	3733511	So, Kingdom Hearts 3, something brand new to the series.
3734151	3736712	Well, something Kingdom Hearts-ish is coming.
3736932	3737772	Yay.
3737792	3739652	Yay.
3739712	3741133	They better have Space Paranoids in it.
3741473	3745894	And I'm here to announce something else that Square is going to be doing.
3746474	3748034	I know this is going to be a shock to everyone.
3748815	3751915	After Final Fantasy XIII, there will be a Final Fantasy XIV.
3752016	3752456	Oh my god!
3752476	3753096	It's coming.
3753276	3753776	It's coming.
3758190	3763717	I speculate there will be five versions of it.
3765318	3773668	I am actually thinking, let me think, there will be another Final Fantasy game re-released on some handheld in the near future.
3774830	3777951	There will be some type of re-release of some game from Square Enix's catalog.
3777971	3781031	And there's going to be another Final Fantasy VII side story.
3781511	3784632	After Super Mario Galaxy, there will be another Mario game.
3784732	3785172	Amazing.
3785232	3786713	And there will be another Zelda game.
3786733	3788093	Well, we actually already know about the Zelda game.
3788913	3791454	But there will be a Metroid 4 in some capacity.
3791514	3793094	There will be another Metroid game as well.
3793114	3797135	And then they will also re-release a remade version of the old Metroid.
3797635	3803296	And despite what the rumors say, if you think they're not going to make a Halo 4 or some type of Halo story, you're kidding yourself.
3804042	3816252	All right, anyway, speaking of games that are going to be kind of expensive, as all those games are going to be, there was an interesting story run by Forbes this week that breaks down the price of a $60 video game.
3816473	3819615	Of course, a lot of people are bitching and moaning because games are $60 now.
3819655	3822698	I don't know if you've heard, but games are kind of expensive in this day and age.
3823679	3826141	And this is where your money goes.
3826561	3828563	$27 goes towards the making of the game.
3830023	3832624	15 goes towards art and graphics.
3833024	3835205	$12 goes towards gameplay mechanics.
3836105	3844067	Now, $12 goes to the retail markup, meaning that the store you actually buy it from gets $12, because it usually costs them about $48.
3844987	3847268	And there's a console owner fee of $7.
3849674	3855039	and the retail and publishing parties involved only really get about $1 for every game sold.
3855600	3863709	They might be able to push it to $3 a game if they sell advertising in the manual or do some of that in-game advertising stuff or what have you.
3866332	3866792	Interesting.
3868674	3870276	That's where your money goes if you ever wondered.
3870515	3871516	That's economics for you.
3871776	3885808	Well, if you ever wonder where your emails go when you send them to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, they go to the bowels of hell known as Jamie's house, where she opens them up and reads them and finds some of her favorites to read for you all on air.
3886328	3888250	So do you have some mail for us this week, DarkSakura?
3888350	3888790	Yes.
3895069	3897071	Damn you people, only five this week.
3897131	3897971	What's up with that?
3898652	3900413	I expect better of our listeners.
3900433	3902755	I heard there was a holiday or something going on.
3903415	3903796	So?
3904916	3906097	It doesn't take long to type.
3906638	3907739	I type 90 words a minute.
3909140	3911341	I can have a letter typed up in, you know, three minutes.
3912022	3912342	Anyway.
3913343	3915004	Nah, but we got some pretty good emails.
3916005	3918847	The first one comes from, I guess it's pronounced Igor.
3920028	3921549	This is Igor, regular listener from...
3922750	3942505	Florianopolis Brazil that's cool I've been listening to you for quite some time and I consider it a very good podcast top 5 on my iTunes every week by the way I believe that you should be experiencing some problems in iTunes and a stupid thing popped up sorry I had my DVD pop up and then I closed my case while it was reading so it covered email
3942870	3951476	Anyway, um, okay, um, this is not the first time this happened, at least twice in the last month because I downloaded Part A and it is only eight minutes long.
3951816	3953478	Does anyone also have this issue?
3953578	3954498	Keep doing a great job.
3954538	3956120	Hope to see you guys down here in South America.
3956240	3956960	Sincerely, Igor.
3957801	3959322	Um, I don't use iTunes.
3961644	3962064	I do.
3962245	3964946	I always check to make sure the podcast works okay on iTunes.
3965087	3969830	I've never been able to duplicate the issue, but you're not the first person I've heard to complain about it.
3970350	3972472	Unfortunately, there's not a lot we can do on our end.
3972512	3975814	I'm not sure what iTunes is doing to cause it or if it's a server thing.
3976154	3984140	I think iTunes, if the download moves too slow, and considering how much we get hammered when a new show goes out, because we're distributed on the Xbox,
3985214	3986014	God, now I can't remember.
3986034	3986434	Xbox Live?
3986454	3987995	No, no, not Xbox Live.
3988015	3989276	The XP Stream, thank you.
3989596	3997799	We're on that, and that hits us every 15 minutes, so a lot of people hit our show right when it comes out, and I think it might be causing the server to move a little bit slowly.
3997999	3999919	There are other subscription services you can use.
3999979	4009563	Yeah, there are other subscriptions you can use to get on the feed, or you can go to the feed directly and just go to where it says Download Our Podcast on the main site.
4009823	4012604	You can actually pull the MP3s directly from our page.
4013694	4020597	And there's also, you know, you can use Yahoo Podcasts, although they've fallen behind on the listing, so I don't know how much I support that one right now.
4021517	4025779	And Dig, but they mirror the show on their site or something kind of funny.
4025859	4032121	So if you're not going to use iTunes, I would suggest maybe like PodNova or the, what is that thing called, Juice?
4032622	4035563	Or something like that that would pull down the MP3s as well.
4035663	4037323	Or go directly to the feed and save it from there.
4038244	4039264	When I get them, I go to the feed.
4040004	4041245	So I can tell you it's reliable.
4042130	4047692	Well, we have another one coming from Gorilla, which is cool because I'm a fan.
4048212	4050312	Well, no, I see Gorilla and I instantly think Gorillas.
4051513	4053393	Hey kids, long time listener and fan of the show.
4053433	4057574	Just wanted to comment on some things said on past shows in regards to eBaying Wii or PS3.
4057594	4059555	It's sort of a long one.
4061235	4063096	So forgive me if I paraphrase a little bit.
4063916	4067257	I personally have no problem with someone selling their bought and owned device.
4067417	4071598	If I own a PS3 for two minutes or two years, I own it and have a right to put it up on eBay.
4073741	4078785	If someone thinks this is wrong, then they should have been in line in front of me and got one, and they could have done whatever they want with it.
4078805	4079466	It's not my business.
4080046	4084930	In my own defense, I did get a PS3, and I did wait in line for a Wii, so yeah.
4086771	4088913	I don't believe people should be getting anything the easy way.
4089053	4090714	I think everyone should work hard for what they have.
4092135	4094097	Or the game companies should make enough of it.
4094437	4095378	Yeah, there's that too.
4096499	4100802	I fully blame Sony and, you know, greed for the state of that.
4105383	4113926	This is going to be an email I'm going to post on our forums because it is long, but I'm going to read the last paragraph because it sort of mirrors a little bit how I feel about it.
4115326	4120227	I'm sure you will edit this if you read it on the show, but the bottom line is this is my opinion.
4120727	4127229	If you own something, no matter how long, especially if you put the time and effort to wait in line with a bunch of people who would never want to stand out,
4127782	4129423	You never want to stand next to otherwise.
4129803	4134764	It is your right to self-smash, burn, throw out a window, or keep for years before selling it back to GameStop anyway.
4135364	4143047	If people don't like it, then tell them when they see an auction for $3,000 on an already overpriced $600 device, don't bid.
4144127	4144847	I do agree with that.
4144967	4145287	Hold on.
4145327	4148248	I thought you were staunchly against reselling these consoles on eBay.
4149128	4149649	No, no, no.
4150129	4151529	I'm going to say this very specifically.
4152369	4157371	I am against buying them out for the specific purpose of selling them.
4158706	4166711	For those people who bought 10 PS3s at 10 different stores in Japan just for the purpose of selling them online, I have a problem with that.
4167992	4177719	I don't have a problem with someone, you know, and I did think about it, you know, I will admit when, you know, I can change my opinion about things after putting lots of thought into it.
4178219	4182522	Say that this is your college tuition, I don't have a problem with that, you know.
4183194	4191978	I mean, if you take it home, and so you, I actually don't have a problem if you take it home, play this, if you know this is shit, and put it on eBay, I don't have a problem with that, at all.
4192818	4201202	I don't have a, now, the one problem I have, though, with using it to make a profit for, say, your bills, or for your mortgage, is that it's gambling.
4201502	4203263	It really, I'm not a gambling person.
4203884	4204224	You know, I...
4206042	4207302	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4227967	4228788	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4253035	4254795	But it is your right to do so.
4255035	4255676	I agree with that.
4256156	4262857	I don't think it's right for, again, those people who were basically getting the edge on the market by buying 100 PS3s and selling them on eBay.
4262877	4264557	That's, yeah, that's much.
4264598	4265118	That's abuse.
4265338	4265798	That's sick.
4266558	4271879	What, but I think that, yeah, all those people, though, who are paying the money for them on eBay, gouge them.
4272599	4273139	Make them pay.
4274080	4277420	You know, because they didn't stand in line and put any damn effort into it.
4277780	4280761	You know, those people deserve to get ripped off.
4281511	4284872	And if it's disposable income, then you know what?
4284932	4290674	They need to take those people away from their disposable income and make them go work hard for something.
4291875	4294136	I have a problem with that.
4296116	4302979	I think that people should actually have to work hard for what they have instead of just having it handed to them on a platter.
4304759	4309081	Although I don't mind when anybody hands me anything on a platter, but I also work hard for everything else I have.
4310009	4312430	It's a different story if you just get everything you want.
4313331	4314832	If you work hard, you should be able to get something.
4315192	4315572	But anyway.
4316713	4320135	Thanks and love the show for keeping up all the good work and reviews.
4320215	4322376	I did buy an Xbox 360 and am keeping it.
4322536	4323096	Oh, you're cool.
4324097	4326198	It's from Gorilla.
4326278	4327299	Post your game and tag on the forums.
4327879	4328760	Join the OL Army.
4328900	4329660	Email from Chicago.
4331121	4331701	Chicago.
4333362	4337945	Once in a while, you should have a retro game segment and feature past systems such as the 3DO game system.
4338686	4339926	which I loved and still own.
4340126	4341086	Okay, you're entitled to that.
4341627	4342367	I was way ahead of its time.
4342387	4344707	Yeah, you're allowed to love it if you really want to love that system.
4344927	4346587	Before PS1 came out and killed it.
4347087	4351448	You know, actually, you must have ESPN.
4351608	4352348	I mean, ESP.
4353088	4355349	Because look for something like that to be coming out next year.
4355369	4356049	All right.
4357169	4357589	There's more.
4358469	4358689	Right.
4359089	4361570	More emails from Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
4361590	4363690	I'm going to have learned giants by the time I'm done with this segment.
4363770	4364130	That's all right.
4364690	4365491	Hey, guys and girl.
4365631	4367351	Yes, Jamie, I wouldn't forget your angsty self.
4367371	4367971	Well, thank you.
4368658	4372400	It's them and yeah, it's been going good down here in Texas, I suppose.
4373620	4376622	The stars at night shine big and bright.
4377082	4377242	Ow!
4377942	4379743	I can't clap with the microphone in my hand.
4380603	4381384	Sorry, can't help it.
4382424	4382784	Pee-wee.
4383525	4385605	Just recently I had an idea for a game.
4385746	4388147	Now don't you start spouting off, I smell a Konami lawsuit.
4388967	4390147	Konami will sue!
4390828	4391088	Hey!
4391857	4394799	But I was thinking of making a Stepmania-type game for the arcade.
4394919	4399721	I have ideas and such, but right now, nothing has been done, and I'm trying to get the word out.
4400221	4405804	Seeing as how I love your show, and I know everybody else should, maybe I can find some help with this.
4405844	4407185	I'm not going to read out the email yet.
4410003	4411805	Enough of my shameless self-promoting or whatever.
4411885	4412145	Hold on.
4412185	4414947	If it's going to change subjects, I want to talk about the Step Mania thing for just a minute.
4415007	4415868	Isn't that just in the groove?
4416108	4420452	I mean, I imagine this person must have some type of separate idea that differentiates it from in the groove.
4420492	4422794	But, you know, it wasn't in the groove, just Step Mania.
4423214	4427918	And, Loki, you actually had a Step Mania cabinet that you helped build for a local arcade.
4428279	4430881	Tell us briefly, in a minute or so, what was your experience with that?
4431361	4432262	It was a pain in the ass.
4432342	4432442	Why?
4432462	4433543	What happened?
4433643	4434984	Just the computers.
4436426	4437787	Normal computers don't like
4438582	4441304	Um, normal, um, arcade cabinet environments.
4441344	4442885	In other words, they get too damn hot.
4443565	4458534	And, um, you know, at the time I didn't have the right tools to basically put a image on that type of a screen because the arcade screens run at, um, what they call CGA, which is a very low resolution, um, screen.
4458574	4463217	But it looks nice in the arcade because, you know, it's really old screen.
4463297	4463677	But, um,
4464717	4466297	It's a pain in the ass, let me put it that way.
4466337	4479981	But now within the groups, you know, arcade stuff, since they just run a PC anyways, you can actually buy a lot of the stuff from like third-party manufacturers and be able to create your own Stepmania cabinet really easy now.
4480501	4484722	And in fact, they actually built Stepmania builds meant for arcade cabinets.
4485362	4490964	So if you build a cool enough computer, and it's also hard too because you have to get the computer to turn on
4491885	4493426	with the actual cabinet stuff.
4493466	4498127	But if you can rig that all up, then yeah, it's pretty easy to do once you've got the setup.
4498567	4500507	Right.
4500547	4501408	To continue with the email.
4502488	4503588	Let me get to my main point.
4503708	4508790	I recently picked up a Nintendo DS and was hoping to pick up a copy of Final Fantasy 3 for it at the closest GameStop.
4509370	4514491	Now, well, I have a good reason to get all angsty about the franchise now seeing as how they didn't even have a copy in.
4515091	4517112	Before this, they sold me a defective 2DX game.
4517492	4519493	Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.
4520353	4520813	That sounds like me.
4521508	4523889	So yeah, that's all I really have to say.
4524309	4527771	Still waiting to get a 360 or are we, me being the poor bastard I am.
4529351	4534993	You know what, I suggest, I don't really think it's the GameStop because they have the stock that they have at the time.
4535534	4536954	Use your phone, give them a call.
4538175	4540796	You know, I live close to three GameStops.
4540816	4546298	If I have been told by a GameStop rep previously, I'm too busy to look, come down here.
4546903	4550084	and that's when I decided I wasn't going to support that particular store anymore.
4550144	4555605	I realized that was that store and not the chain as a whole but that's when I realized I wasn't ever going to go down there ever.
4556086	4558366	Then again, usually I'll have to just say, hey, this is Dan's wife.
4559487	4560087	Well, you know.
4560847	4567449	But no, I actually... I don't get on the phone and go, I have a podcast on the internet so you damn well better help me or I'm going to talk shit about you.
4567609	4569229	No, I just call like anyone else does, you know?
4569489	4575251	Well, I mean, usually what I do is I call and then, you know, if it's one of the managers I've met before then I'll say, hey, yeah, it's me.
4575431	4575571	Hmm.
4576280	4598282	but um honestly though really if you I found a few people who are willing to look to say hey I'm you know I'm going to be coming by if you have this I'm going to be giving you money if you have this but you know I've been in a GameStop when it's busy and when they say they don't have time to look it means they don't have time to look they are that is the
4598985	4600046	And that is a fault of GameStop Corporate.
4600086	4602507	They do not want to give the hours they need to man the stores.
4613650	4614911	I'm not going back to that store.
4614931	4615972	It's not the manager's fault.
4616032	4617674	I teach customer service for a living.
4617754	4619415	I get offended when people do that kind of shit.
4619555	4623659	Well, I was in customer service for a while, too, and I know what I expect of myself.
4623699	4624780	Well, you know what?
4624800	4629985	If they're too busy at that one time, then obviously they're too busy to ring me up at the register.
4630305	4632046	Can I put you on hold?
4632106	4637671	And they could have one employee that's not necessarily working the register because not everyone has to be working the register at the time.
4638012	4639453	They have one employee to check on that.
4639753	4640614	Can I put you on hold?
4641967	4643147	They are supposed to put you on hold.
4643187	4645588	And they are supposed to have you on hold as long as you're on hold.
4646088	4647908	I walked right over to the next... You know what?
4647948	4649489	Instead, I walked right over to the next store.
4649529	4651049	Best Buy picked up my game, left.
4651289	4651689	In and out.
4651809	4652309	Very easy.
4652349	4654110	And that's where I bought all my games for a little while.
4654650	4659371	Well, you know, and it's not really, I think, so much the fault of the store managers.
4659971	4664612	Because having talked to a number of them, they're all like, we need more hours, we need more hours, we need more hours.
4665092	4666552	And it's corporate that's not giving it to them.
4666692	4667352	So blame them.
4668073	4670093	I don't know whose fault it is, but it sucks.
4671537	4673198	Last one comes from Neki.
4673878	4674899	I guess that's how it's pronounced.
4675719	4678181	Downloaded for the first time off iTunes and it's great.
4678221	4679442	Nice community feel to it.
4679862	4682564	I'm from the UK so can't do any of the live forums, etc.
4683425	4685526	Like to hear a few more stories about the UK.
4686267	4686807	We do our best.
4687428	4688969	I look when I can.
4689829	4691190	WePlay is already out in the UK.
4691610	4695113	In the last podcast you said it wasn't out but maybe that's only in the US.
4696004	4698966	We probably were talking about the US, because we're not getting it until February.
4698986	4701808	And I know we had a big story on the delay of Wii Play last week.
4702608	4707652	Whereas you guys, I think, you are just now getting Wii Sports, whereas we added it as a pack-in with our system.
4707672	4708512	So it's kind of interesting.
4710093	4711474	Anyway, looking forward to the next podcast.
4711494	4713735	Until next time, Neki.
4715316	4719659	I'm really, actually, I do try to look for UK-specific stuff.
4720160	4721801	More like Europe in general.
4722821	4722841	I...
4724815	4729399	I mean, honestly, I myself have a lot of love for the UK, and I want to make sure that our folks are covered.
4729419	4740448	Well, keep in mind, a big part of it is, too, is that a lot of stuff, you know, and I don't mean to offend or whatever, but a lot of stuff comes up in Japan and the US first, and then the UK just kind of gets it later.
4740828	4750095	Not to say that there aren't specific things to the UK, you know, obviously, and Jamie tries to stay on top of those, but it's just kind of the nature of the business is most of the business is done in Tokyo and in the Bay Area, you know?
4750496	4750696	So...
4752074	4756075	We try to keep tabs on release dates and things of that nature because we heart our international listeners.
4756795	4760836	But keep in mind, usually when games are under development and things, it is kind of over on this side.
4762176	4765597	But then again, they do get some games that we don't get, like mostly football.
4765917	4767457	Once in a while, once in a while.
4767477	4769258	Some of the games of that nature.
4769918	4772099	I try to keep my eyes open for specific ones.
4772179	4773099	So think of it this way.
4773159	4778720	Hey, at least if we're getting the games first, we can tell you which ones suck, and then that way you don't even have to blink an eye when they come out over there.
4779355	4779695	Exactly.
4780255	4783536	For what little it's worth, because we can't force the companies to change their schedules or whatever.
4783996	4793219	By the way, I think we had a slightly increased listenership this week, because iTunes had us, they have video games as their featured category in podcasts this week, and we're one of them that's in the little box, so that's kind of cool.
4793559	4795460	So, thank you iTunes!
4797480	4798261	Is that it for voicemails?
4798761	4799461	That would be it.
4799681	4800041	Alrighty.
4800641	4801502	You mean emails?
4802562	4804243	Oh yeah, emails, sorry.
4804363	4807063	Give them my voice!
4807083	4809124	1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to leave us a voicemail.
4809710	4813482	I want voicemail from some of our overseas listeners now.
4816846	4817266	That's true.
4817306	4819228	This listener could call our voicemail any time.
4819528	4822410	Now, don't use the 800, but you can go through Skype.
4822510	4822750	Oh, yeah.
4822770	4822890	Sorry.
4822910	4823350	Yeah, that's right.
4823450	4825292	International folks don't want to use it, unless you're Canadian.
4825472	4826553	Unless you're Canadian.
4826593	4827153	You can use the 800.
4827513	4828974	But download Skype.
4829515	4832637	You can actually just send us a message through the Skype line.
4832737	4833697	It's voice over IP.
4834338	4835859	It costs your internet connection.
4835899	4836219	That's it.
4836379	4836659	That's it.
4836719	4840602	So go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com and click on Interact With Us for more information.
4840642	4841062	It's all free.
4841783	4842083	All free?
4842423	4842763	Yes, please.
4843264	4843524	Excellent.
4844414	4846395	Well, getting back into some news here.
4847275	4851557	One thing that we talk about, especially in games and stuff, is all these ads.
4852178	4861702	And a big thing when we were doing the Battlefield 2142 stuff was that their advertisements had a little kind of a spyware feel to it.
4861722	4865984	Because they were picking up your IP and where you're located and
4866856	4868998	that kind of thing so they could target ads towards you.
4869258	4871720	Not a huge deal to some people, but a big deal to others.
4872181	4875624	Well, apparently it's a big deal to some California lawmakers.
4876004	4890556	California Assemblywoman Lori Saldana is going to be working on introducing a bill into state legislation that would halt companies like EA from including Spyware technology in games.
4891517	4894660	And, you know, they found, you know, certain...
4895359	4898621	methods used by these companies as particularly vile, as she puts it.
4899301	4904444	And definitely something that I'd like to see passed because, you know, I'm not sure.
4904464	4906785	I don't think it's on our show role.
4906805	4909747	We were talking about like advertising games and how it's not very effective.
4910127	4920173	And so, you know, gathering information from these companies and the EA is really bad on this, you know, especially with where you have to sign up and have your credit card information and stuff like that.
4920193	4920833	It's not good.
4921201	4924963	What I'm interested in is, you know, she seems to get it.
4925503	4925723	Yeah.
4925984	4927304	What, who is she?
4927404	4929926	How did she figure out about, I mean, is she a gamer?
4930826	4933267	No, it's just, I don't know, she just seems to get it.
4933627	4933868	Hmm.
4934328	4942472	Do we have, because, you know, one thing we felt like we don't, we haven't had much of in the political world is some type of pro-gaming champion, you know what I mean?
4942492	4948295	I don't mean like a professional gamer, but I mean like somebody who supports the video games and the gaming community.
4948555	4949916	We've certainly had a lot of anti-
4951331	4955712	I think she's kind of interested in, it's mainly privacy experts.
4955792	4958613	I see, so she's more of like an EFF type champion.
4958653	4962293	Yeah, and I think this just kind of relates a little bit to stuff like that.
4962313	4968455	And basically she's saying that it doesn't advertise it on the outside of the packaging and it contains the stuff.
4968475	4977277	It's like, you bought it and then, oh, by the way, we forgot to mention that, you know, that installing this will actually send us some private data.
4977377	4979217	And you need to do this in order to play the game.
4980238	4983883	I would just like to see someone who gets gaming in Congress, that's all.
4984123	4984984	Jamie, run for Congress.
4986025	4987787	Okay, pay my way.
4990370	4991752	Vote for Jamie, kay thanks.
4992933	4994575	Yeah, vote for Jamie, or die.
4995577	4998380	Alright, anyway, well that should be interesting to see what happens with that.
4999261	5000042	I think that's kind of cool.
5001059	5006840	I think it's something that should... I think the company should know they're going to be looked at if they're going to use these type of tactics.
5006900	5008341	So I support it.
5008661	5010801	I'm curious to see what the specifics of the bill will be.
5012862	5021583	Since this is our holiday episode, this last official story we have for you guys has to do with Bethesda and their big, big, big game, Oblivion.
5022143	5027585	They are giving away for Christmas a brand new expansion pack for Oblivion.
5027645	5029005	Well, it's not new, but it's...
5030670	5032271	It's a Christmas theme pack or whatever.
5032671	5034292	No, it's not a theme pack either.
5034592	5035733	It's one of the older expansions.
5035773	5036854	They dropped the price to free.
5037914	5039795	Oh, I thought it was a new one.
5040115	5041416	Oh, all right.
5041456	5041996	Well, whatever.
5042537	5046599	Maroon's Razor, which I guess used to cost money, it's now being offered for free.
5046619	5048180	Well, that sucks to everyone who bought it before.
5049220	5049821	Never mind.
5049861	5051902	These guys are grinches for doing that to those people.
5052602	5054984	Unfortunately, I have not played any of the Oblivion expansions.
5055024	5057505	I apologize for my mistake.
5057981	5059001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5077093	5077873	Tis the season.
5078293	5081874	And so I guess Nintendo is the Grinch after all, not putting out anything free.
5081894	5084335	Well, they did have the internet channel, so maybe not.
5084715	5089456	They did give you that, and the forecast channel, and coming up the news channel too.
5089856	5091257	But the internet channel, you know, is free.
5091517	5094217	So I guess we all got a little something for Christmas.
5094297	5097418	Now here's something I gotta mention though, and I'm not sure if you noticed.
5097758	5099799	Wii Connect 24, what the fuck does it actually do?
5099819	5101819	Because it sure as hell doesn't update my system.
5102399	5104940	It sure as hell doesn't download this new stuff automatically.
5106192	5106712	What the fuck?
5106792	5107032	I mean...
5132173	5133775	Well, at least you get that message.
5133875	5134896	That's, I don't know.
5135096	5136358	At least you have the message, right?
5136378	5139662	Nintendo sent you a little email that said the forecast channel is now available, right?
5139702	5140383	Yeah, great.
5140543	5141163	Good for them.
5141244	5143646	But it's not, you know, this WeConnect24.
5143726	5146129	It's always connected to the internet.
5148051	5150514	No, it's always connected, but it's not doing anything.
5150534	5151956	All right.
5153365	5164374	Well, we have another segment here before we close out the show and that would be DarkSakura who likes to surf the internet up and down and left and right and all that be a select start kind of stuff.
5165035	5171780	She finds a website that she must share with all of you guys and it's called DarkSakura's Website of the Week.
5171960	5172721	And we have happy music.
5177284	5179046	So this week's website better be happy.
5179891	5181812	I didn't do crap to find it, you told me about it.
5181932	5183253	Oh goody, you used my pick.
5183353	5185474	I made a suggestion, and it got picked.
5185514	5186215	I'm so excited.
5186955	5190377	Weekitty.com, W-I-I-K-I-T-T-Y dot com.
5191057	5192298	This site is crack.
5192678	5195800	It has a gallery of cats and wees, and it's so cute.
5196120	5197281	You can see the kitty.
5197821	5200142	So it's like stuff on my cat, but with Wii controllers?
5200222	5200603	Yeah.
5200663	5201403	That's awesome.
5201443	5202324	This is fantastic.
5202444	5203504	I need to do one with Shermie.
5204305	5208167	And on top of that, they actually say Happy Caturday, which makes me think of 4chan.
5209471	5211654	So, yeah, this is cute.
5212935	5214798	I'm going to submit Shermie on WeKitty.
5215599	5219183	I'm going to go look at WeKitty on my Wii and bookmark it as a favorite.
5219323	5222808	I actually have Shermie snuggling up to an Xbox 360 controller.
5222928	5223829	There you go.
5223849	5226592	Well, you should make 360kitty.com.
5227033	5228495	No, I'm not going to pay for the domain.
5229278	5229638	They're cheap.
5229658	5229979	I'm poor.
5230259	5230980	Loki, you can do it.
5231000	5231520	I can do it.
5231540	5236865	You know, you should put, like, PS3Kitty.com and have PS3 crushing the cat because it's so good.
5236925	5237285	I got it.
5237386	5237906	CatBox360.
5239367	5242390	And have, like, do, like, litter boxes up like an Xbox.
5244612	5245233	That would be rad.
5245753	5252540	I did notice that WeKitty did use the opportunity to give a big fat plug for the people who made it their own personal little game review site.
5252600	5253821	So, you know, we could use...
5255132	5256693	360 Kitty or whatever is a big plug.
5257093	5257393	I don't know.
5257433	5258594	I want to jump on the bandwagon.
5258835	5260196	How about Xbox Puppy?
5261056	5262177	Where's the love for the puppies?
5262798	5263619	Puppies are stinky.
5264800	5266081	And they require too much attention.
5266201	5270945	I would admit that I'm a cat person over a dog person, but I do think puppies do deserve a little bit of love.
5271245	5273747	How about DSGirbles.com?
5275629	5277450	Lovehamster.com.
5277470	5277951	There you go.
5280172	5280493	With a P.
5282153	5282934	Pro Evolution Sucker 6 Hey
5309283	5313744	Pro Evolution Soccer 6 is now a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace.
5314685	5318266	It's the rival of FIFA 07.
5319726	5328349	It's only available for Xbox Gold, but it will be available to Silver on the 29th, and it's a 1.31 gigabyte game.
5329870	5330990	Tell us what's on it, because we don't know.
5332511	5333851	I'm not a football girl, but
5335410	5338973	Isn't this the same one we saw an early build of at the Panami BBQ?
5338993	5341054	It looked pretty hot.
5341935	5342495	For soccer.
5344316	5348159	Not that I'm necessarily... Okay, I have to say, I do love football.
5348880	5349300	A little bit.
5350621	5353563	But not... You're a rugby girl.
5353843	5354304	No, no.
5355264	5357066	When I say football, I mean soccer.
5357626	5358807	Because American football is shit.
5359748	5360268	Pure and simple.
5360328	5360888	Sorry, it is.
5360968	5361389	It's crap.
5361789	5364471	It's a crap sport, and it's just crap.
5364964	5369746	More people would probably watch football if they had cheerleaders like American football.
5369766	5373327	Yet it seems to be the most popular sport in this nation.
5373967	5376588	Yeah, and the rest of the world says, screw you, that's stupid.
5377168	5377928	We like real football.
5378848	5380969	And it gives me an excuse to watch men in shorts.
5381129	5381889	I like basketball.
5381969	5383190	Yeah, but you know what?
5383250	5388712	The rest of the world may be all about this metric system, but hey, we're too good for that.
5388852	5392613	It's all about fucking base 12 systems.
5392673	5393133	Hell yeah.
5393740	5394941	You mean the Imperial system?
5395221	5395561	Yeah.
5396101	5403565	Well, doesn't it sound better, or doesn't it sound much nicer to hear that it's only, you know, it's 40 degrees Fahrenheit outside?
5404365	5407267	Doesn't it sound so bad as, you know, negative two!
5407287	5410468	Anyway, forget it, never mind.
5410488	5412950	Well, there's another one as well.
5413670	5417952	Nintendo... For the record, I agree, the metric system is better.
5418908	5419529	to get that on record.
5419549	5427457	Nintendo has stated that the reports that came out of France saying that Wii Sports 2 is already in development is quote, a rumor and speculation.
5429729	5432051	But pretty good speculation of that, honestly.
5432071	5439257	Well, NGC France reported that there was one that might include swimming, basketball, a few other sports.
5440538	5444761	The quote, though, coming from Nintendo, was really pleased with the reaction to Wii Sports.
5445422	5451607	From people completely new to gaming, to the hardcore fans, everywhere has taken to it straight away.
5452488	5455590	That's a quote from one of the Nintendo UK spokespeople.
5456831	5458953	And they're actually speculating it might be the most popular game.
5460745	5461105	Interesting.
5461585	5462586	No love for Wii Soccer.
5463626	5464606	Dude, that would be cool.
5464846	5466407	Would you kick your controller around there?
5466467	5466787	I know.
5466827	5467467	How would you do that?
5468527	5471888	You put your controller in the ball moat.
5473949	5475810	Well, it detects directions.
5475970	5477130	That's a great idea.
5477170	5482412	Then people can kick the ball around the house because the Wiis aren't breaking enough things around the house as it is.
5483112	5484272	Kick a ball through the window.
5484932	5485933	Real smart, Jamie.
5486613	5487433	A winner is you.
5487953	5488734	Was I serious?
5489734	5489894	No.
5490302	5490782	Partially.
5491423	5491543	No.
5513914	5522736	I mean, it was kind of, like, it was stupid in the gameplay value, but, like, getting to chop people's arms and legs off and then they still have to fight with no arms or legs was really funny.
5525116	5525676	Playfighter, man.
5525696	5526557	Get your arms off.
5527217	5528777	All right, Loki, you have any last-minute stories for us?
5528877	5529437	Of course I do.
5530057	5531558	So, the story came out.
5531898	5538839	Apparently, there's a way modifying your own DVD firmware in your own CD-ROM drive or DVD-ROM drive on your PC.
5539699	5541420	You're able to rip Wii discs.
5541520	5541860	So, now...
5543032	5544993	Pirates have won yet another battle.
5546094	5549256	It's only a matter of time before we see pirated games being run on the Wii.
5549837	5552299	Until Nintendo says, oh, you want that news channel?
5553259	5555921	That's what they'll use Wii Connect 24 with the updates.
5556161	5559504	They'll just silently push out the updates that'll patch that kind of shit.
5560564	5561645	Well, they haven't done it yet.
5562686	5563146	We'll see.
5563526	5566148	And who says I have to connect it to the internet while I'm playing these games?
5566529	5572673	And to be honest, if they can burn them the exact same way as the discs are burnt now, they'll never know.
5573158	5573818	We'll see, we'll see.
5574198	5577999	Anyways, that being said, let's see here.
5578519	5580820	Also, it's kind of funny.
5580840	5587282	You know how if you register three games with Nintendo that you get a free three-month trial to Nintendo Power?
5587662	5595204	Well, apparently the folks at GoNintendo.com found out that the Wii Internet channel counts as a game, and now they get a free subscription.
5595944	5596184	Hooray.
5597785	5598345	That's kind of funny.
5598545	5599165	Does it really?
5599305	5599545	I didn't.
5599969	5601349	I mean, I have my subscription all the time.
5601409	5603770	I actually have all my Nintendo products registered in Nintendo.
5603810	5606531	It's a lot now because of those stinking virtual console games.
5606951	5611152	I have the virtual console tied to my Nintendo account and you get credit for all those games you download.
5611452	5617194	I really wish here in the US they did some type of reward systems like they did in the other countries.
5617294	5623276	If you're using the Wii browser and find that you really want tabbed browsing in the Wii, well, fear not.
5623296	5626417	The website has actually figured out a way to do that.
5626957	5629558	If you want to browse tabbed
5630276	5639724	websites, you can check out team-dsx.net slash ds slash basic.php.
5640384	5649471	And apparently this was used for the Opera Browser on the DS, but can also be used for the Wii Opera Browser to add tab to the browsing functionality.
5649712	5653535	I don't want tab browsing so much as I want support for my USB keyboard.
5654255	5654776	That would be nice.
5656057	5656317	Anyways.
5657092	5674546	and of course since there was the free Gran Turismo HD demo being put out there actually ended up leaking a little bit early on the PlayStation 3 network and crashed it because it was more than it could handle which is kind of fun.
5674566	5676387	That's funny.
5676688	5685434	We mentioned that Bethesda is putting out the free Oblivion expansion or I should say dropping the price on it but more
5687080	5688501	Test Drive Unlimited Test Drive Unlimited
5712293	5720000	McLaren, F1 GT, Dodge Viper, SRT 10, Coop, and many more.
5720560	5721441	So that's kind of cool.
5721981	5732931	They've also got a free Forza Motorsports Showdown trailer, which is available on both Canada and US Xbox Live.
5734873	5739857	And then also three different Command & Conquer Tiberian Wars trailers
5740714	5741414	Thanks for watching!
5757068	5758889	I'm kind of surprised it wasn't that bad.
5758929	5761449	And keep in mind, I'm not as attached to Transformers.
5761469	5763510	I haven't seen it yet.
5763570	5764730	You haven't seen the Transformers?
5764790	5765451	Oh, my God.
5765491	5766331	I've been busy.
5766851	5770992	Right after the show is over, I'm going to download that sucker in HD so she can see it.
5771112	5772653	Oh, I have it in HD already.
5773533	5775033	Go to Apple.com.
5775594	5776174	It's not Apple.
5776674	5778254	No, they have it on Apple's site, don't they?
5778274	5778875	No, it's not on Apple.
5778975	5779175	What?
5779195	5779935	It's on Yahoo.
5779995	5780335	You lie.
5780908	5781388	I don't lie.
5781668	5791812	Anyways, so, speaking of the trailer, apparently there was some interesting stuff shown during the trailer between the 37 second and 39 second mark on there.
5792112	5797194	There's a frame that shows Sector 7 Org at the top and Takara 83 at the bottom.
5799091	5806516	And apparently, that if you go to Sector7.org and enter in Takara83, it starts an ARG.
5806836	5811839	So a brand new alternate reality game tied in with the Transformers thing, a new viral campaign.
5811999	5816462	And then when you solve it, you get forwarded to All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com.
5816522	5817282	Isn't that amazing?
5817302	5818143	Yeah, that'd be funny.
5818663	5822706	No, but it's a brand new start, so definitely worth checking out, I guess.
5823906	5825047	Alrighty.
5825187	5827929	Oh, and I'd like to also mention, you know, just the kind of,
5828524	5831747	Start the show the way I ended it, or end the show the way I started it.
5833468	5840854	1UP is reporting Earth Defense Force 2017 is coming to the U.S., and I do believe I mentioned that on an earlier podcast.
5841094	5842935	So humble, the great and humble Loki.
5844617	5845918	All right, that's it.
5846118	5849220	It's only a one-part show tonight, because the holiday and the pre-tape and everything.
5849581	5852783	So this is the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
5853003	5853904	And I'll start tonight.
5853964	5854985	My final thought is...
5855632	5859714	January 22nd and Heroes returning to TV.
5859774	5860415	I can't wait.
5861776	5862436	It's too long.
5863577	5866719	At least I have some Kiefer Sutherland to hold me over.
5866739	5868780	Let me know when my man is on that show so I can come watch it.
5868800	5870241	He's supposed to be on the first episode.
5870301	5872162	So when is that?
5872282	5874443	January 22nd, so you better watch the first 11 before that.
5874483	5875003	What night is that?
5875484	5875764	Monday.
5877045	5877485	I have school.
5877745	5878345	Damn you.
5879706	5882448	And on the eighth day, the Lord gave us TiVo.
5883539	5885040	I need new lungs and reject false icons Loki?
5885060	5886621	My final thought is I'm not buying any more Ubisoft games
5905690	5908031	I want to get somebody from that company on the show so bad.
5908091	5909612	I want a one-on-one with Loki.
5910032	5910332	All right.
