15727	19470	And now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20256	26898	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this special New Year's Eve special leading on into the year 2007.
26938	32260	We're bringing on some special guests from all across the independent gaming voice community.
32520	41143	We have some bloggers and other podcasters and folks who do other live shows and even dipping in and having some guests from the sci-fi and geek world coming in as well.
41403	44064	And that's where our next guest comes from, yes, DarkSakura?
44164	45324	Definitely comes from geek world.
45864	47805	This is Travis from Travis Donovan Live.
53915	55196	Thunderstorm Warning, Tornado Watch
82899	83500	Oh fun!
83580	84360	And no power.
84881	86702	No video games for you then today.
87723	89264	No, and I just got my Wii today.
90645	92706	Oh no, how did you finally get a Wii?
94087	104995	Went to EB Games of all places, and just randomly, after stopping at GameStop, and asked GameStop first, and they said no, they had PS3's in, but not Wiis.
105075	107817	Went to EB Games and said, hey, do you got a Wii?
107837	110499	And the guy just looked at me and went, yeah.
110659	112440	And I said, hook me up, my brother.
112856	113856	Random stroke of luck.
113876	115096	What games did you get for your Wii?
116217	120117	I got Rayman, the rabid one that everybody hates.
121698	124618	We've heard some pretty good things about that from some of the other guests we've had on the program.
125558	127839	I figure if everyone else hates it, then I'm going to love it.
129079	129459	All right.
129679	137300	Well, then we definitely want to know your opinion on some of the best and worst in 2006, because if your opinion is the opposite, then that should be kind of interesting.
137360	139381	So we have ten boxes left.
139481	140961	Please pick a box, one through ten.
142956	144876	All right, we'll go with lucky number seven.
145097	146577	Lucky number seven, here we go.
146697	147617	Let's open the box.
150938	155979	And the category we want to know your opinion on is best game to play online.
156579	159040	What was the best game to play online in 2006?
160540	165561	Well, that's going to be difficult, seeing how I didn't play a lot online and it would have been 360 only.
165941	168662	You know, I'm going to take a book.
169210	177217	or a page from my family here and I'm going to go with what they play online all the time and it has to unfortunately be the soul-stealing Final Fantasy.
177877	181880	Ah, Final Fantasy 11 then on 360, right?
182801	183021	Yes.
183602	184783	Well, no, on PC.
184863	186204	Oh, they're still playing PC.
186244	191348	Well, we're going to have to say the 360 version because the PC one came out a couple years ago but the 360 one was this year.
193090	194871	Okay, well then let me change my damn answer.
194891	195652	All right, all right, all right.
195672	196032	What then?
197988	199869	Best game this year to play online?
201010	202510	Oh, what the hell, Gears of War.
202710	203811	Gears of War!
204511	205652	Very popular choice.
205692	207393	Any particular reason why you chose Gears of War?
210434	214096	I have it for the 360 and I played it online like twice and it was fun.
215657	216857	Have you played the co-op mode?
216917	222400	I hear a lot of people, I think the reason why a lot of folks really enjoy Gears of War is because of the co-op.
222760	224141	And not a lot of games encourage co-op.
225494	228441	I would play with you, Travis, at some point.
232779	234219	Okay, that's just kinky and wrong.
236140	237420	All right, then, fine.
237480	240581	The choice stands as it is, and I'm not going to play online with you.
241342	243382	All right, well, then how about this news topic?
243702	245423	I'd be very curious to know your opinion on this.
246263	259427	Earlier this year, there was a TV station that used to represent gamers a long time ago that changed their slogan earlier this year, and that was G4 Television, and their new slogan as of earlier this year was, We Get Guys.
259907	262408	You ever watch a G4 TV, Travis?
264264	274232	Unfortunately, I have accidentally stumbled upon it because on my channel listing it's awfully close to BBC America and stuff like that.
274332	276234	So I accidentally tuned into it.
276414	276654	I see.
276674	280678	Did you ever watch G4 Tech TV back in the day, right when they first merged?
281698	286562	In its heyday, well actually before it merged, Tech TV was the bomb.
286622	289745	It was the shiznit, as they say in the ghetto.
291126	292147	It was the best thing ever.
292714	294295	for geeks and gamers out there.
294996	296817	Then when G4 took over, it was fine.
297097	297778	It was okay.
297878	304463	There was some bumps in the road, but unfortunately now it is what I like to call a partial birth abortion of a network.
305303	305864	What happened?
305904	306464	What went wrong?
308346	314070	They have no idea or concept of how to program a network around gaming and technology.
314870	320835	They're too ratings conscious, and unfortunately they have a talent pool
321559	327845	which makes a West Virginia gene pool look like genius status.
329066	334210	Do you think that there's a need out there for a video game network or do you think online kind of fills that void?
335231	337753	Well, the internet of course fills it.
338034	339415	It fills it extremely well.
339975	347342	There are tons of sources whether you've got your GameSpot, your IGN, your 1UP, your Joystick, whatever.
349330	354232	and print-wise, magazine-wise, you also have a plethora of magazines you can buy.
355633	378902	Television-wise, it would be good to have somebody or a network that wasn't jockeyed one way or the other by advertising dollars to sort of twist their slant on gaming in the industry because I'll tell you right now, you can tell on G4 that the almighty dollar really does affect some of what they say on that network
381145	383386	I'm not a big fan of that network.
383446	390811	I think what they've done to my holy grail, which is Star Trek, is ridiculous and stupid with that whole 2.0 shit.
391652	392653	Pardon my English.
395675	397716	Now they're showing cops.
398497	398897	I'm sorry.
399137	402720	I was flipping the other day and I saw cops on there.
402740	404701	I was like, wow, it's very interesting.
405305	409889	Why do you think then people continue to, in the gaming world, care about G4?
410570	421939	Because, you know, I've noticed that once in a while game blogs and game sites run these stories on G4 television, and I can't help but personally wonder, and I know we've talked about it on our own program previously, why do people continue to care?
422139	428244	If G4 is not giving the gamer world what we need, why is the gamer world continuing to give them free press?
429626	433669	Well, so long as you have any type of mass media outlet,
434190	440152	everybody is going to try to take advantage of as many of those outlets as possible and G4 is one of those.
440773	452677	You have the talking heads on that network which are there to shield their products and that's why people still care unfortunately about G4.
454758	462161	I do find G4, I give G4 credit to be one of the very few Americanized networks
462799	478548	that actually employ a she-male, Morgan Webb, and a spasmodic schizo with severe bipolar disorder, Adam Sessler, and the rest of their lineup.
478688	486733	And I love how they steal British interactive television game shows and claim them as their own, i.e.
486793	491876	that late night video game or that game call-in show that they do.
492458	502649	which is a steal from a British show that they do over there.
502729	513680	So long as they're on the air, game companies will use them as an outlet to show their products because the attention span of the American public is that of a fruit fly.
514224	514464	All right.
515005	516626	They'll get their media anywhere they can.
516966	521769	Well, we here at Orange Lounge have given them too much air time as it is, so we need to move right along to the next topic.
521789	522670	But thank you for your input.
523610	525992	What did you think was the best video game of 2006?
526072	527953	We're tallying it up tonight.
529114	535879	The best game of 06, again, I'm going to fall back on, is Gears of War, just because it took the first-person shooter.
536519	540102	It really didn't ratchet up a notch as far as the style of gameplay.
540142	543364	It's still the same run, duck, cover, shoot, but...
543874	551317	The graphics quality, I think it's the first true game of 06 to take advantage of the next-gen console.
552538	557460	And it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out with the other next-gen console, the PS3.
558120	567765	I don't throw the Wii into the category of next-gen because graphics-wise it's the same, but the 360 and the PS3, you're finally seeing the developers get a hold of this, and I'm looking forward to 07.
568605	573087	I think Wii tries to classify itself more as a new-gen than next-gen, so...
576313	583615	The Wii is definitely revolutionary and it is going to be fun to play and it's going to be innovative and it's going to be fun to see how publishers take advantage of that as well.
584255	585596	What was your worst game of 2006?
585696	588156	Oh, God.
588557	589737	We don't have enough time on the show.
590637	598660	I'm going to go from a standpoint of a letdown as far as genre is concerned.
601180	602801	That would have to be Star Trek Legacy.
603739	605760	Ooh, wow, why Star Trek Legacy?
607421	619989	It's not so much, the story, the single player story missions are incredible, and they're fun, and the graphics are great, and it's great that you have the voice of all the captains, and that part's wonderful.
620750	629135	What's killing this game from being as hot as Bridge Commander was on the PC, and as I went into it on my show, is...
630929	634250	The multiplayer on this game literally sucks.
634350	637171	I mean, it sucks big floppy donkey dongs.
639652	642473	Half the time you can't even get into a game.
643193	644013	You get kicked out.
644113	645474	The connections are horrid.
645934	649015	The lag times are not bad when you finally get a game.
649455	651155	But the problem is getting a game.
651916	656197	You think it's possible maybe the developers will push a patch out that hopefully will fix some of it?
658480	662963	They were quick to push a patch out for the multiplayer on the PC.
663083	667926	They literally had that out the same day it was released on PC.
667986	673430	Legacy was a port from 360 to PC, so that was because they were having problems with GameSpy.
673530	678073	GameSpy is well known for having compatibility issues with games anyways.
679754	681896	If there was going to be a patch, it would have been out by now.
682751	683551	and I don't think.
683671	690313	I think Bethesda Soft is just taking CBS Viacom's money and saying, here, we gave you three games.
690353	691193	Thank you for the money.
691834	694654	Good luck and thanks for all the fish kind of thing.
695155	695515	All right.
695575	703457	Well, I know Star Trek is something near and dear to your heart because you do the sci-fi program here on Orange Launch Radio on Saturday night, yes?
704544	706645	Not so much sci-fi anymore, but yes.
707385	711287	What exactly can the fans expect to hear when they tune into Travis Donovan Live on Saturdays?
711687	717349	Well, that's great, being the station manager and such as you are, keeping up to speed with the shows, Rob.
720430	723491	I do throw a little sci-fi and geek into it, of course.
724212	732935	But I'm now getting to the point where I'm so pissed off with the morons in television and the morons on the Internet that
733493	736796	I'm the angry, pissed off, motherfucking, hetero, white, middle-aged man.
760626	764808	Well, I'm not so much middle-aged, but for your listeners, I would be considered middle-aged.
768750	771892	It's sort of what Travis Donovan Live is all about now.
772392	774573	The tagline is putting reality back in its place.
775093	777794	What are you looking forward to most in the geek world in 2007?
777834	782156	Not necessarily games, but anything.
783257	789360	I'm interested to see how well Vista plays out when Windows Vista releases.
790103	792565	How well of an operating system that's going to be?
792665	798470	Is it just going to be fancy new graphics and user interface, or is it actually going to be something substantial?
799410	804594	Because nowadays it's so easy to steal information and corrupt data via the Internet.
804674	810659	I'm just wondering how much more secure Vista is going to be.
810699	814142	I mean, it's already been hacked from what I understand, so that's not a good sign.
815002	818045	The rest of technology, I mean, that's up in the air right now.
818837	821059	Things are moving at such a pace.
822139	823981	It's always fun to see what the Japanese bring out.
824001	827623	They bring out robots to help the invalid.
828024	833788	I'm hoping soon they'll bring out a robot that'll help wipe my butt because, again, I'm a lazy American and I don't like to do that.
835989	839212	On that note, I think we should probably say goodbye.
839512	841593	Thanks so much for being on the program tonight.
842294	842934	Oh, good.
842974	845536	Let's end the call on the brown note.
845856	846637	That's great.
847558	850680	or as we've called it on the show previously, the Brown Eye of Judgment.
851261	852662	We shall have to go back to the archives for that one.
853563	856725	TravisDonovanLive.com for more information on the program.
856765	860508	Saturday nights here on Orange Lounge Radio and podcast on your own site too, yes?
861589	863410	Oh my God, you remembered the URL.
863590	864010	I did.
865031	868133	Yeah, it's my podcast via my site.
868173	869074	I'm also on iTunes.
869514	869795	All right.
870295	871536	Search him out, Travis Donovan.
871856	873838	Thanks so much for being here and best of luck to you in 07.
875288	875708	No problem.
875748	877429	Hopefully, you know, it'll be great.
883893	892657	Now, for those that don't know, you know, if you go way, way back in the broadcast history of myself and DarkSakura, we actually started on a show with Travis.
892717	897460	He did a long time ago called Understation Alive, and he's still pretty funny after all these many, many, many years.
897720	901062	I was the fill-in person slash most frequent guest.
901202	902943	Yes, and I was the...
903317	904979	I remember making the calls to pay phones in Disneyland.
923607	925128	How did the payphone calls go?
925549	926309	Someone answered one.
926570	927310	We did get one.
927551	931074	From what I remember, we had somebody answer it once, and we actually had a conversation with them.
931335	934057	But then we called back, and the call mysteriously dropped.
934177	938982	And we were theorizing that the Disneyland police had tapped our conversation and dropped the calls.
939002	941885	Because you know Disneyland's got some scary security.
942506	945049	The whole point of it, though, is that they are presenting...
946209	951132	It's why all the stuff that happens around the park is called behind the scenes for a reason.
951852	954033	The employees are cast members.
954453	958475	Everything there is sent to present something, and a phone call, they don't want to get in the way of that.
958495	959196	All right.
959256	963618	Well, speaking of craziness, our next guests are crazy, but in a good way.
963918	964638	Yes, DarkSakura?
964778	964978	Yeah.
965559	968460	We have Franz Sheeran and Ron Wickman from Destructoid.com.
974392	983315	All right, we are joined here now on our Orange Lounge Radio year-end special with one, two, three people joining us from the website destructoid.com.
983655	985195	Say hello, everybody, to Franz.
986435	986996	Franz, you there?
987036	988416	This is Franz from Destructoid.
988736	989676	Hey, how you doing, Franz?
990056	990937	Man of many words.
992257	995938	And the voice you hear there is Ron, Graybush Workman.
995978	996518	How you doing?
996918	997819	Graybush in the house.
997879	998519	Thanks for having us.
998999	999639	Not a problem.
1000059	1002200	And also joining us, say hello to Shir.
1003069	1003729	What's up, guys?
1004489	1006330	Yeah, I don't have anything to say.
1006590	1006890	I'm boring.
1007010	1007530	That's all right.
1007850	1010871	We often don't either, but we somehow fill three hours every week.
1011371	1012711	I'm so fucking laid back.
1013892	1021013	So, now you guys all, you know, you blog for the Destructoid.com website, but do you guys participate in their podcast as well, Podtoid?
1021754	1022294	Occasionally.
1022954	1023714	Yeah, sometimes.
1024074	1024654	Usually, Ron.
1024894	1027695	Yeah, I'm usually, I'm turning into the comic relief for the show.
1027735	1031196	They beg, but I'm like, you know, I have things to do, leave me alone.
1032043	1034764	How many bloggers do they have over at Destructoid?
1034784	1039585	Because when I'm looking at the list of people, it looks like I'm looking at a picture of The Last Supper or something.
1039605	1040466	There's so many people.
1041246	1041926	What are we looking at?
1042006	1045247	Probably mid to high 30s.
1045307	1048008	I mean, in January, we're maybe looking at over 40, hopefully.
1048028	1049428	Wow.
1049568	1050309	A couple more people.
1050369	1060912	We've got well over a dozen people that post daily and consistently and stuff like that, and that's kind of our thing, what we're shooting for, is to update information, have
1062444	1063765	Gregory, we made a joke last night.
1063785	1067808	Hey, we rarely own a website that posts at 3.30 in the morning every day.
1067868	1070750	We've got people that are up all night messing around with stuff.
1071230	1073852	So you guys really are an army of robots when you say that.
1074293	1076374	It seems that way.
1076555	1078376	We're turning into the detoyed army, I guess.
1078709	1085051	Alright, well, we want to pick the army's brain here a little bit on some of the gaming topics in a little game we call Year in Review 2006.
1086791	1091852	And so we have nine boxes left, because people have been plucking all the other boxes.
1092793	1093813	And Franz, we'll start with you.
1093933	1095313	Which box do you want to open up?
1095473	1097534	Box 1 through 9, any one of them.
1098054	1099875	If there's a PS3 in it, I'm returning it, though.
1100615	1101295	We'll see.
1101975	1102755	I'll go with 9.
1103616	1105036	Box 9, let's take a look.
1109019	1114183	We want to know, Franz, what did you think was the most creative game in 2006?
1115643	1116064	Damn.
1116244	1117505	Most creative game in 2006.
1119166	1119666	Come on.
1119766	1120446	Viva Pinata.
1120466	1121087	Viva Pinata.
1122027	1123688	Actually, no, Ron's actually got a point.
1123728	1125149	It's one of the two games we played.
1125229	1126110	Viva Pinata.
1126170	1135555	When you get a game where you re-rate the engine to make it look more kiddy, and it's mating animals that dance around for the whole game, that's pretty damn creative.
1135595	1137096	You said there was two going around in your mind?
1137116	1138157	What was the other one out of curiosity?
1138991	1141592	No, that was just the only game around Morkman's Blotting this year.
1141812	1143252	Oh, I see.
1144733	1147274	Is Viva Pinata really for kids, though?
1147414	1151675	Because I know when I played it, I was like, if I was seven, my controller would be through the window right now.
1151695	1152856	It's going to be tough for kids to understand it.
1152896	1155396	It's like Pokemon in the sense that anybody can enjoy it.
1155596	1157497	Like, I played Pokemon, and that was a great game.
1157597	1163199	I don't know, and this is stuff in Viva Pinata that my Greybush ass couldn't figure out how to do, that's for sure.
1163919	1165820	I was getting frustrated with these vinyadas.
1165840	1168681	I was looking stuff up on the internet and people were feeling bad for me.
1168701	1170302	Like, here, I'll send you a vinyada.
1170322	1172803	And I'm like, no, I want these damn mice to have sex.
1173323	1174784	And Ron's in fucking Mensa.
1175184	1178425	My vinyadas kept beating each other.
1178545	1180646	It was like Lord of the Wise.
1180886	1181966	Horrible.
1182086	1183307	Those kept getting sick.
1183911	1185632	So, Viva Piñata, most creative game.
1185912	1198280	Franz, the news topic we want to know your opinion on, and, you know, I don't know if you have any friends over in the UK, but it seems like one of the recurring themes in 2006 is that our buddies in the UK keep getting the shaft.
1199921	1201442	I think that's been the story of their lives.
1201502	1203003	That's definitely true.
1203103	1210168	Why does Britain keep getting fucked over when it comes to release dates or, you know, system launches, prices of games?
1210608	1211729	Why do they keep getting picked on?
1213018	1215399	I think, yeah, I think it's a shame.
1215419	1220761	Like, if Microsoft would jump on that and divvy up their sales a lot more, I think that would give them a lot more price.
1220841	1222242	Now, didn't the Wii just come out?
1222562	1224583	Yeah, the Wii couldn't even give them enough, though.
1225003	1226623	They could barely do pre-sales over there.
1227084	1229364	No, it came out like two weeks ago.
1229645	1232466	Oh, okay, and they're waiting until March, I guess, to do the PlayStation over there?
1232486	1235127	Yeah, they're not even going to get a taste of it.
1235267	1237668	Well, hell, half the United States isn't getting a taste of it now.
1237688	1240969	Although, it's important to note, too, that they ban games that's kind of
1241497	1241817	PS2 PS2 PS2
1270546	1271126	It was decent.
1271367	1275309	I just, I think the problem with Ruler Rose, it was a full-priced title, wasn't it?
1275409	1276710	It was like a $49.99 they wanted for it?
1276870	1277090	Yeah.
1277271	1281093	Yeah, so, yeah, that was the biggest problem is because PS2, you know.
1281413	1289079	Well, that's just Atlus because they're retarded and still think they can get $49.99 for a PlayStation 2 game at the end of its life cycle, so.
1290199	1295523	Well, you know, I guess if Square can get $59 for a collector's edition of Final Fantasy XII, which has nothing special.
1296024	1296884	by the way, nothing special.
1296924	1299946	Final Fantasy XII, I love this in Final Fantasy.
1300146	1301467	It is a sexy game, I'll give you that.
1301827	1308790	Alright, and it's actually GameStop that thinks they can get $59.99 for the special edition of Final Fantasy XII.
1309031	1311892	Well, they got it from me, but that's because I'm a corporate whore.
1313693	1315254	Shira, it's your turn, why don't you pick a box?
1315274	1316714	Now we have one through eight left.
1316734	1319436	I'll pick number three.
1319916	1321677	Box number three, let's open it up.
1325296	1326277	Box number three.
1326357	1327258	Oh, this is a good one.
1327598	1331081	What do you believe was the most disappointing game of 2006?
1331141	1331281	Hmm.
1331381	1335544	Oh, I'm going to get a lot of flack for this.
1336785	1339127	Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.
1339267	1340448	Oh, snap.
1342069	1343190	Why Zelda Twilight Princess?
1344130	1349211	I don't know, because Zelda is the type of game where everyone's like, this game is better than unicorns fucking pixies.
1349691	1350271	But it's not.
1350371	1352332	It's not so great, and that would be great.
1352472	1353432	I don't know about you guys.
1353552	1354112	That's funny.
1354132	1357153	That's exactly how I described it on the last episode of Orange Lounge.
1357233	1357753	It's amazing.
1357773	1363914	I was like... Everyone's like, this is going to be the greatest game ever, and then I played it and I was like, eh, this isn't the greatest game ever.
1363934	1364914	I don't know.
1365254	1368155	My only little comment for that is it came out two years late.
1369195	1369475	Yeah.
1369932	1371492	It's part of the thing that makes it a disappointment.
1371512	1373413	Is that the problem for you?
1373453	1376033	Is that this is essentially a GameCube game with Wii controls?
1377153	1378093	Well, no, that's not the problem.
1378113	1382094	It's just that I don't really like Zelda that much.
1382194	1384194	I like games in that genre.
1384254	1386275	I liked Ocarina of Time was okay.
1386315	1387915	I liked Majora's Mask like Wind Waker.
1387935	1390095	But this one is just like boring.
1390115	1393836	There's no real character depth and I was just like, yeah, fuck this.
1393856	1396416	Anybody else want to chime in on what they think the most disappointing game of 2006 was?
1396437	1396477	Uh...
1400498	1404922	Rare didn't come out, did they?
1406363	1407804	Didn't they just release Viva Pinata?
1407844	1408565	Viva Pinata?
1408945	1409325	It is.
1409345	1410967	That's a Rare game.
1411847	1413068	Oh, no.
1413769	1414369	Nomadrome.
1415430	1417992	Nomadrome for Xbox Live Arcade.
1419173	1419974	Why Nomadrome?
1420434	1421535	Oh, it was garbage.
1422376	1423076	It killed me.
1423116	1423717	Have you played it?
1424207	1425428	Yeah, I didn't enjoy it, yeah.
1425709	1428431	It was just, you look at it, it's like $10 for this thing?
1428811	1438080	It was like a really bad, like... I only played a few minutes, it was that bad that I was just laughing, but $10 for a game that's a real bad twisted metal?
1438140	1438881	Oh, Red Steel 2.
1439642	1442084	Red Steel was atrocious.
1442184	1444506	Can you believe they greenlighted a sequel to Red Steel?
1445667	1449271	Yeah, because I think a lot of people were really looking forward to it, and really like...
1449804	1452505	Looking for all the new concepts and they're like, man, this is going to be the greatest game ever.
1452665	1456687	And Ubisoft, when they released it, everyone was like, well, this isn't that good.
1456707	1458227	There are a lot of things you could do better.
1458307	1465130	So Ubisoft's going to take that into account, make a better game with the similar core gameplay, and it's just going to be fucking awesome.
1466074	1466895	That's what I hope happens.
1467475	1467835	We'll see.
1468635	1475139	Shir, the news topic I want to know your opinion on has to do with the price ranges for video game systems in 2006.
1475819	1481022	We heard at one point that, even though I think most of us knew this was BS, but the Revolution was going to be $99.
1481282	1484043	This is when it was still called the Revolution, not the Wii.
1484363	1488325	And then suddenly it was $250, more reasonable, probably what we expected.
1488545	1493868	But then all the way up to $600 for the PlayStation 3 or $500 for the low end, depending on how you look at it.
1494168	1499834	So we've had systems cost anywhere at one point or another in theory or whatever it be, $99 to $600.
1500374	1507761	How important do you think price is of these systems in the console wars that are going on here in 2006 and on into 07?
1508582	1511445	I'm glad I got this topic because I'm broke as hell.
1511645	1513226	So this is just the perfect topic for me.
1513366	1516469	And it's a big factor for me when I'm buying systems.
1516630	1519052	For example, I don't have a 360 because I'm broke.
1519993	1526617	It's like $400, and you can't play without live, really, and then it requires a yearly fee that I really don't have.
1527237	1529398	No, $400 live comes with it.
1529938	1530579	Shut the hell up, Ron.
1530759	1531959	You always miss that.
1532259	1535161	You always see these press releases, and they're like, and then you've got to buy live.
1535341	1536782	No, it comes with it for $400.
1536882	1538423	Dude, the gold package or whatever.
1538883	1540564	Well, who gives a shit?
1540584	1542625	If you want to play games online, you can play with silver.
1542665	1544866	There's no difference aside from multiplayer games.
1545669	1548190	You can't have four people on your Xbox playing.
1548650	1549590	Alright, shut up.
1549730	1550710	Gold's a better color.
1551751	1552831	It is.
1553851	1554892	And, uh, yeah.
1555412	1556412	So anyway, Wii's $250.
1556692	1561153	I thought it was going to be cheaper, so did everyone else, but I really didn't care, because I could scrape up $250.
1561854	1564414	Can't scrape up $400, because I suck.
1565095	1569096	And, uh, the PS3 is just way out there, and even if you wanted to go on eBay, it's like a grand.
1569776	1570156	And, uh,
1571223	1576146	For six dollars, go buy a cheap remote, spray paint it white, and spray paint your GameCube white.
1576166	1576726	You got a Wii.
1577887	1578447	No, you don't.
1578707	1579828	Neither one of them can play DVDs.
1579868	1580948	I can't argue with you, Ron.
1580968	1582789	They both have subpar graphics.
1582849	1584990	But you can't play Elebits on the GameCube.
1585971	1586651	He makes a point.
1587972	1589293	They're not going to drop that?
1589453	1592875	They're not going to push it out on the... I guess there wouldn't be any way to do it with controls.
1592895	1593175	Damn right.
1593195	1593535	You're just lost.
1596135	1597655	Well, we've got to keep it moving here.
1597695	1598936	Thanks for your input.
1599976	1601957	Let's move on over to Graybush.
1602477	1602977	Oh, great.
1604217	1606318	Please be a question about how to get rid of crabs.
1606378	1607778	Please be how to get rid of crabs.
1607938	1609258	One through seven, take your pick.
1609819	1610919	I will take number four.
1611239	1612259	Number four.
1612379	1613820	Let's open up case number four.
1617521	1620261	Best downloadable content for a game.
1621582	1622602	Oh, content...
1626121	1631630	Oh god, you're going to rag on me on this one, but I hate to say this, but the damn UNO player packs.
1632231	1632712	Really?
1632732	1635016	Are you a big Camp Nou cards fan?
1637938	1641440	The thing I had the most fun with this year is all... Are you coming out of the closet, Ron?
1641581	1641981	I know, man.
1642261	1644222	I'm Ricky Martin all over again with this.
1644262	1647805	I'm just... I can't... Best downloadable add-on to a game.
1648285	1651227	Well, Call of Duty map packs obviously were cool for me.
1651527	1652628	Well, I thought you said Uno.
1652668	1653909	I thought we were going with Uno here.
1654349	1655470	Well, I'm just trying to think.
1655530	1657651	I'm, like, arguing back and forth here.
1658432	1663035	I'd say Call of Duty map packs I probably had the most fun with, but the Uno stuff, like... I...
1665270	1666091	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1678598	1688020	I would have to be a tie between the stupid add-on packs that actually got me to play Uno and stay up all night with people bullshitting on there and the Call of Duty 2 maps.
1688420	1691401	Does it have anything to do with the webcams on Uno?
1691421	1695502	Because, you know, that's one news story that didn't quite make our cut for being included tonight.
1695882	1702784	When they first came out, it was really funny because there'd be three or four of us in a room and we'd be like, oh, look, yeah, there's somebody's ass.
1702804	1704444	Oh, look, somebody's boobs.
1705848	1709892	And it was like, I guess the novelty wore off real quick, but it was a really funny thing.
1709932	1718960	But it was cool because we would, like, I could sit on my back porch and smoke cigarettes and play Uno, because the controller vibrates when it's your turn, and Uno's so hard you just hit the A button.
1718980	1720241	You don't even have to look at the screen.
1720582	1730571	I mean, seriously, every many nights I'd be sitting outside smoking a cigarette, couldn't even see, but I'd be chatting on my headset, hit the A. When the controller vibrated, I'd hit the button and it'd throw a card out there, because it doesn't matter, it's Uno.
1731348	1737630	Playing UNO on live is weird for me now because I feel like I'm always playing against LonelyGirl15 with the webcam.
1739691	1745013	But, you know, it's one of those things where I never expected to have fun ever, ever playing UNO.
1745033	1746833	I never even expected to play UNO.
1746993	1750495	And when we get in there, it's just a bunch of us friends and we bullshit and we have a good time.
1750535	1753396	And it's not as much about UNO gameplay.
1753436	1757817	But I remember when we added the new decks to it, it changed the game, and we started playing with strategy.
1757837	1760078	It was like we're actually playing fucking UNO.
1761203	1765529	You know, those type of things where somebody's done something right if we're actually playing Uno.
1765649	1767892	Now, are you guys big on the shit-talking on Uno?
1767932	1769894	Like, you know, drop four, motherfucker, and things like that?
1771670	1773071	Yeah, but it's always joking.
1773511	1774532	Reverse bitch.
1776332	1781215	Speaking of fun games, the news story we wanted to ask you about would be Guitar Hero.
1781315	1787058	Because we obviously had Guitar Hero 2 come out this year, which is the sequel to a monster hit last year.
1787458	1795462	And then they announced, and this is still a bit of a rumor status, but that there's going to be a quartet of new Guitar Hero games coming out through the next year.
1795922	1798464	You know, the one on the 360 and so on and so on.
1798964	1801125	Is too much Guitar Hero too much of a good thing?
1803388	1809051	I've never played it because it's a video game and it involves me dancing around with a plastic toy guitar.
1809731	1815815	There is nothing that's ever going to be cool about a grown man dancing around with a plastic toy guitar.
1816095	1818376	I know I get you.
1818416	1822058	Sitting on the back porch playing Uno smoking cigarettes is fucking rad, huh?
1822438	1825540	Dancing around with a plastic guitar?
1825560	1826901	That's going to be a rock star.
1827691	1847479	is like the lamer version of DDR for me I know people love it and get into it but it's just like, you play it with a plastic toy it would be like me playing Call of Duty with a squirt gun, hiding behind couches Ron Workman's a communist Ron, out of curiosity Ron, have you ever heard of a Japanese game called Parapara Paradise?
1848880	1854482	No Alright, just don't, don't ever look it up because you'll hate it Is it a rhythm game?
1855262	1863344	Yeah, it's based on this old Japanese style of dancing that was done by girls wearing these big tall boots, and they wave their hands around to Eurobeat music.
1863665	1866585	It's something to behold, I'll give you that.
1866645	1873307	Mine is one of those things, like, I would never let someone see me in public playing DDR unless I was completely just wasted, drunk off my ass.
1873327	1877589	Because when I see people playing DDR, I'm just like, you look ridiculous.
1877829	1881910	I'm one of those guys that's just like, look at that guy playing DDR, he looks like an idiot, and it's...
1882697	1885519	I've always been like that, and Guitar Hero is kind of the same thing.
1886400	1890483	I'm not condemning it, but I can't see myself playing with a blast.
1890663	1892845	But in the privacy of your own home when no one's looking?
1893745	1894506	Maybe I would.
1894606	1901932	It's kind of like the Wii in a way, where if you play it at home, people are going to see it, and people like Ron won't want to play it, but the others will be interested, and they'll pick it up.
1902072	1906435	I can see the 360 sales doing well with it, but six months from now, I don't see it doing well.
1906455	1908276	And when they come out with the wireless guitar?
1908296	1908456	Yeah.
1911164	1914026	And that actually looks pretty tough, so maybe I'll get one when I do that.
1914506	1916208	Alright, alright.
1916468	1920571	We're going to go around now and I'm going to ask everybody what they believe the best game of 2006 was.
1920771	1923633	And the worst game we hear at Orange Lounge Radio, we're tallying it up.
1923933	1925074	So we'll start with the best game.
1925134	1927195	Franz, what did you think the best game was of 2006?
1928896	1931478	Cliche, but Twilight Princess.
1932939	1935241	Why Twilight Princess over everything else?
1935580	1936741	Waiting for Shearer's answer now.
1936761	1939442	Because I'll admit that it's not quite as good as I hoped.
1939542	1951990	I think the wolf part downplays it a little bit, but if you forget about that it's a Zelda game, and if you just pretend it was a completely new game, and you compare it to any other game from 2006, the gameplay is solid.
1952430	1953731	There's not a lot to complain about.
1953991	1957853	It's a high nine, so I don't think it will ever top it, not even Gears.
1958514	1960435	It's a game that's topping a lot of people's list.
1961255	1962997	Shearer, what did you think the best game of 2006 was?
1964892	1966414	Final Fantasy XII, hands down.
1966734	1967374	Final Fantasy XII.
1967394	1969296	That game just ripped me apart.
1969376	1972799	I got it, I played it for like 20 hours in the first like three days.
1972999	1973900	I just played it non-stop.
1973920	1974540	I love that game.
1974720	1975561	It's so good.
1975681	1977823	Have you always been a Final Fantasy series whore?
1978463	1980545	Or was XII kind of your enabler?
1981366	1983427	Well, you know, I played Final Fantasy VII, loved it.
1983467	1985749	Played Final Fantasy VIII, fuck you guys, loved it.
1986110	1987451	Played Final Fantasy IX, hated it.
1987731	1990253	Hated FFX and hated everything else after FFX.
1990413	1992194	So FFXII was kind of like... Which would be FFXI.
1993737	1995878	Yeah, FF11 and then like the spin-off games.
1995958	1996839	Oh yeah, true.
1997539	1998520	They're just ever so crap.
1998660	2000781	No, I deleted those from my brain.
2000901	2002382	FF10-2 doesn't exist to me.
2003563	2011147	Yeah, so, you know, I really liked FF12, Rebirth of the Series, really interesting characters, amazing graphics, and I just loved it so much.
2011427	2011928	It's so good.
2012268	2014649	All right, dare I ask Ron Workman, best game of 2006?
2014709	2017531	You're going to make fun of me, but...
2018588	2019949	Burger King, Sneak King.
2021510	2023732	I'm totally fucking right.
2024873	2026094	Come on, it was the best value of 2006.
2026154	2030117	Yeah, the Burger King games were three bucks, four bucks, whatever.
2030137	2034981	Yeah, I could pay $4.99 or I could pay $5 for a new Rally-X.
2035561	2036061	Let me think.
2036642	2038603	Hey, you're really going to lay into me.
2038623	2040705	I actually bought that shit, didn't I, when I was drunk.
2041584	2042625	I bought Rally-X.
2042745	2043966	So did I. Let's not tell anyone.
2044226	2045707	Ron, best game.
2045888	2046188	Out with it.
2046208	2052213	I remember it when I was a kid, you know, playing with a big steering wheel and stuff.
2052573	2053274	Gears of War.
2053374	2057057	I mean, I really liked Viva Pinata and Call of Duty 3, I think, was underrated.
2057097	2060520	But I'd have to say, I mean, Gears of War, hands down, it's a no-brainer for me.
2060580	2064503	You know, and I'm not into the fantasy games like Zelda or Final Fantasy.
2064563	2067545	Nothing against them, but I just... You're a gun fan.
2068346	2070748	It's an amazing game to me.
2071104	2072745	Call of Duty 3 is the same way for me.
2072765	2074425	It's really immersive for me.
2074445	2075726	I like how they've changed it.
2075746	2076286	A lot of people...
2099042	2101062	Call of Duty 3 definitely on your top 10 for the year at least.
2124844	2132166	Yeah, it was a real late bloomer for me that I just wasn't expecting to be that good because I heard so much bad feedback.
2132186	2135447	I like Call of Duty 2 because I'm a big multiplayer fan.
2137107	2138007	My worst game of the year?
2138348	2139028	Yeah, sure, why not?
2139168	2140308	Let's go into worst game of the year.
2140388	2141148	Ron, start us off.
2141648	2142249	NovaDrome.
2142689	2143489	NovaDrome!
2143749	2146030	He smacked me in the face for making that game.
2147470	2149350	They owe me $20 for playing the demo.
2149390	2150191	That's how I view it.
2150451	2151291	And I'm still pissed.
2151920	2160402	What was so... I mean, because I don't know if it's just me, but they really hyped up these end-of-year Xbox Live independent title releases that they were going to do.
2161083	2164003	And I wasn't really impressed with any of them, even Assault Heroes.
2164604	2165824	I wasn't really feeling.
2166924	2169105	I was kind of like, I'd almost rather play Rally-X.
2169305	2170465	Ten bucks, you know?
2171065	2176527	Yeah, Rally-X, the deciding thing was like, I was like, I'll play this when I was a kid, whatever, you know, five bucks, no big deal, but...
2177205	2179927	$10 on some of those games is a little tough for me to swallow.
2179987	2182349	And it's not that I'm tight with money about it.
2183270	2187553	But if I could play the demo, like the Assault Heroes demo was pretty long, that's fine.
2188053	2191856	I've bought Pac-Man and Frogger and Galaga and all those, but Contra.
2192357	2196020	Out of curiosity, how do you feel about the Wii downloadable stuff?
2196060	2196800	Would you pay $10 for an N64 game?
2198539	2206389	The last time I played a Wii was six months ago at a private show, and I've not played one since, and I'm not even seeing the virtual console stuff.
2207190	2209593	Is that what it's called, virtual console?
2209693	2210054	Yeah.
2210534	2211756	Yeah, not even seeing it.
2212297	2217323	I do know about the pricing, and it disappoints me that Nintendo's doing that.
2218275	2224600	I guess they can because their fans are, you know, I really hate to get into this, but Nintendo fanboys are pussies.
2224640	2227362	You guys should stand up and fight.
2227943	2230324	You should fight Nintendo.
2230505	2234007	You should fight Nintendo to make better shit.
2234147	2235909	Nintendo's never going to make better shit.
2235929	2239311	They're going to come out with subpar consoles and charge too much.
2239411	2243274	All right, Nintendo fans, you can address those cards and letters to Graybush, Care of Destruction.
2243294	2245316	Run Graybush Workman, yeah, exactly.
2245496	2259013	but no, it's one of those things where Xbox Live is genius and the reason it's genius is because people are absolute assholes to Microsoft and they're not scared to be if they're pissed, they will flame them to hell and back or write it on their blogs or whatever
2259372	2262795	Do you think maybe no one wants to stand up to Reggie because he'd kick your ass?
2262815	2267579	Nintendo is this golden cow that nobody wants to, you know, they're on a pedestal.
2267759	2269720	Oh, Nintendo can't do anything wrong, blah, blah, blah.
2269820	2271762	There's some shit games out there on the Wii.
2272142	2275765	Nobody bitches about them like they would if it was a bad Xbox game, you know?
2277146	2277567	I don't know.
2277647	2279929	Loki kind of went off on cars the other week.
2280009	2282150	Yeah, I think it's pretty fair.
2282491	2285073	And all the Ubisoft games suck ass.
2285373	2288776	I have officially boycotted them for all their Wii launch titles.
2289375	2290115	What about Rayman?
2291036	2296018	Rayman was just average, and that was their best game of the entire lineup.
2296258	2297599	Yep.
2297639	2306643	Rayman was my favorite, but I really wish that people would say, Hey, Nintendo, we don't want a system that only has the graphic power of an Xbox, an original Xbox.
2307304	2308864	We want to be able to play DVDs.
2308945	2313026	We want to have online multiplayer out of the box and launch games to back it up.
2313087	2313947	Or maybe they don't.
2314577	2316718	We don't want to pay $10 for a Mario Bros.
2316738	2320280	game we've bought 20 times before.
2321280	2324101	It's dicking their fans over.
2324121	2332365	When you add all that stuff into what you spend to have games and play the Wii and to track down four controllers for the damn thing, it's not any cheaper than buying a 360.
2332405	2335706	Alright, we've got to keep it moving.
2335726	2337147	That's right.
2337167	2337847	That's okay.
2337867	2341409	You just sound like you could go all day long on this Nintendo thing.
2342190	2348839	I'll leave them to read the Destructoid.com blog to see your further love and adoration for all things Nintendo.
2349359	2350921	Fight for your rights as a gamer.
2352804	2354566	Shearer, what would you say is the worst game of 2006?
2356692	2362374	Red Steel, because you asked me what the biggest disappointment of 2006 was when I said Twilight Princess.
2362774	2365475	But Red Steel was the kind of game that I never really had expectations for.
2365695	2368096	I saw it, I was like, that could be cool, but it's probably not going to be.
2368737	2370057	And I played it and it wasn't.
2370257	2371097	It was just so bad.
2371257	2375019	And even the multiplayer, like, I'm walking around, dinosaurs shooting me in the face.
2375039	2376099	I'm like, what the hell is this?
2376860	2378700	The controls were terrible, the guns were terrible.
2378940	2380681	I just hated it with a passion.
2381138	2383519	I remember the buzz about that a long time ago before it came out.
2383539	2385019	It was like, this is going to be really cool.
2385039	2386900	You know, you can swing your sword around, blah, blah, blah.
2387100	2387900	Oh, man, multiplayer.
2387940	2389481	It was like, this is garbage.
2390201	2395483	Y'all heard about that whole, like, they're going to call you and you put the Wiimote to your ear and everybody's like, that's such a cool idea.
2395863	2396864	Yeah, yeah, exactly.
2396884	2398084	It's so retarded.
2398144	2398524	I'm playing it.
2398564	2403446	At the time, they were saying you were going to be able to use a microphone that was in the Wiimote because I played it a long time ago.
2403506	2404687	Yeah, that disappeared quick.
2404707	2405547	Which never came about.
2405587	2405787	Yeah.
2406400	2426427	But I was, like, my friend got it, and I was like, dude, let's go play it, and we're playing it, and, uh, like, the multiplayer, as soon as you figure out how to use your stupid sword, like, you run up to people, and you're just like, they're dazed, and you just shoot them in the face, like, 45 times, and it's so annoying, because you can't kill anybody unless you're using your stupid sword, and, like, multiplayer's cheap, uh, and the stupid ring thing is retarded.
2427007	2428708	Was the game just rushed, you think?
2429412	2430773	No, I just think it was atrocious.
2431113	2432234	I think they don't know what they're doing.
2432614	2436236	They said they were working on it for months, fixing it, so I think it just couldn't pull it off.
2436376	2438297	I think they were just like, yeah, fuck this game, this is terrible.
2438917	2439538	I don't know what they did.
2439658	2445901	You know, you would think that they might be able to sell copies of Red Steel 2 if they just said, oh, Red Steel 1 was rushed, sorry, we'll make it better next time.
2445961	2447382	But it wasn't.
2447662	2448002	It wasn't.
2448022	2448663	It was just bad.
2449023	2449803	Alright.
2449883	2451805	Franz, what would you think was the worst game of 2006?
2453228	2454148	This one's pretty easy.
2454668	2455369	Armado.
2455709	2462331	It's a game on the PSP, and all it is is you're an armadillo rolling around a mountain, and all you do is hit one button to jump at the right time.
2462511	2464051	That's the entire $40 game.
2464551	2465291	I shit you not.
2466292	2467772	And it's not even a homebrew.
2467832	2469773	It's an actual... It's an actual game.
2469813	2475794	It was like a small company's first game, so I hate to knock it, because, you know... You're making shit up to get out of this easy.
2475854	2477395	Nobody knows what you're talking about.
2477455	2477915	I hate it.
2481966	2485628	It caught my eye in game trailers and I laughed my ass off at it.
2485649	2492293	You know, funny enough, that's not, out of all the ones we've heard, that's not the first game somebody mentioned as the worst game that none of us had heard of.
2493194	2494594	So, there you go.
2495195	2496316	It'll be interesting to hear the rest.
2497016	2501599	So is this why the PSP keeps getting flack for not having the same game power as the PSN?
2501619	2502320	PSP's terrible.
2503180	2504961	That should be my disappointment about 6.
2505282	2505982	They have good games.
2506002	2506703	They just don't have enough.
2507983	2509564	I hate the PSP.
2509685	2510445	I have it right in front of me.
2510465	2510745	I hate it.
2510765	2511546	I want to throw it out.
2513151	2514392	It cost me so much money, though.
2514412	2517174	But Luminous, Metal Gear... Yeah, 360?
2517414	2518235	Yeah, keep going.
2518495	2519255	All right.
2520136	2520496	All right.
2521137	2523018	Anyway, we got to wrap it up here.
2523519	2527862	What do you guys have planned for 2007 over at Destructoid, if you can say?
2528302	2529643	Lots of giveaways, that's for sure.
2530164	2531605	Yeah, super secrets.
2532045	2532685	Lots of bitches.
2533366	2535127	All right, lots of bitching, lots of prizes.
2535307	2537109	We want to give away a Wii a week.
2537867	2539007	Yeah, we're working on it.
2539107	2540468	That's what we're shooting for right now.
2540728	2546030	And we've got a big contest going with the Lord of the Rings people, I think, at Microsoft.
2546250	2550791	And we've got a big, big, big World of Warcraft thing coming at the end of the month.

2571311	2571751	Not me.
2571811	2572331	I don't know.
2572371	2575352	Ron, do you want to print out your 45,000 of them?
2575712	2577972	I can't talk about them.
2577992	2578713	Secrets about them.
2578733	2580793	We're very good discreet peoples.
2581633	2582174	All right, well.

2595164	2595993	or three thousand of us.
2603257	2618210	Big thanks to those guys over there at Destructoid.com for coming on the program and especially to Franz because originally him and I were on another show called Cross Platform together earlier this year which is why I remembered him and originally it was just going to be him that came on but he was like, dude, you want to get some more people on?
2618270	2624215	So he got some of his co-bloggers over there at Destructoid.com to come on as well and that was a fun little interview.
2625556	2629940	I definitely need to check out more of their own podcast over there because I'm sure it's a riot so.
2630595	2634716	So check that out over at Destructoid.com One of my favorite gaming blogs, by the way.
2634996	2635636	And I mean that.
2635896	2637277	That's the best site address ever.
2638497	2641278	I like their little robot icon that they work into everything.
2642218	2643038	So, pretty cool.
2643998	2646219	Alright, who's coming on next, DarkSakura?
2646379	2647919	I have Godfrey from Gamertag Radio.
2654421	2657922	Alright, I'm joined here now by Godfrey from Gamertag Radio.
2657962	2658662	Godfrey, you there?
2659574	2660235	Yup, I'm here.
2660255	2660955	What's going on, man?
2661055	2661836	Hey, not a lot.
2661856	2662456	How you doing?
2663377	2664258	Everything good, man.
2664298	2665699	Big fan of the show, man.
2665879	2666379	Big fan.
2666479	2666820	Thank you.
2666860	2667240	Appreciate it.
2667260	2668461	We're big fans of you guys as well.
2668481	2670362	You guys have come a long way.
2670382	2674165	You're, what, going to be two years podcasting pretty soon?
2674946	2682412	Yeah, it's going to be two years now in February, but I've been also recording before that around 2000, 2001.
2682632	2683453	I used to have a
2685399	2688622	Like a fantasy star online radio show.
2689042	2692826	At that time, on the Dreamcast, it was like a big community.
2693286	2699011	But I also used to help out these guys, GamingNoise.com, Chip and Zach.
2699792	2700953	And I know all games, too.
2700993	2703915	They used to do a radio show, too, at that time.
2704095	2704716	Yeah, they were around.
2705216	2707778	Just out of curiosity, Phantasy Star Universe was out this year.
2707838	2709060	Did you kind of get on board with that?
2710020	2711522	Yeah, I was playing a lot of...
2713376	2719339	for like a good month, but then, I don't know, I wasn't feeling it like how it used to be with the Dreamcast.
2719419	2721561	It seemed like more strict.
2722221	2727804	Last time on the Dreamcast, it was like more open, and I don't know, it just, I don't know, it felt kind of different.
2727824	2731746	I don't know if it was because of the next-gen consoles or, you know, I don't know.
2731926	2735028	I just wasn't too thrilled with the online gaming on that.
2735805	2737005	That's all right.
2737265	2738686	Now, I want to ask you about this, too.
2739266	2743287	You guys have had a lot of, like, Microsoft celebrities on your program this year, haven't you?
2744267	2745088	Yes, a lot.
2745348	2753210	Recently, we had an Xbox Community Awards, and we had a lot of people from the Xbox community, a lot of podcasters in there.
2753610	2761352	And also, people from Microsoft came to the show to help us out and, you know, just thank the community that has been helping out throughout the years.
2762612	2782792	Major Nelson was there, Trixie, Peter Moore was also part of it, Aaron Greenberg It's been a great year for us, man We've been busting our butts big time this year I want to thank everybody from Microsoft for helping us out Yeah, it sounds like it's really paid off for you guys So congratulations, those are some big names to have on your show
2783772	2784312	Yeah, man.
2784873	2786854	I mean, if we could do it, anybody could do it, you know?
2787194	2789136	Everybody's just got to be dedicated, man.
2789476	2789956	Absolutely.
2790537	2797382	I want to ask you this as well, because your show is mostly centered around Xbox, but do you play Nintendo Wii, PlayStation?
2797402	2798602	Do you play the other consoles, too?
2799123	2799923	Yeah, I have.
2800084	2807869	As a matter of fact, I was camping out, man, trying to get the Nintendo Wii during launch day.
2808349	2810591	I was in line for at least 12 hours, man.
2811398	2812739	I've been playing that here and there.
2813119	2817920	I've only been playing Zelda for the Wii.
2818181	2821302	I downloaded a couple of Virtual Console games, too.
2822402	2824143	I'm just waiting to see if I can have more games in 2007.
2828471	2830132	and Winnie for WarioWare.
2830733	2832734	I played that too in the Nintendo Party.
2832754	2835236	They were here in Miami a couple months ago before launch.
2836096	2836937	I liked that game a lot.
2837017	2838498	Yeah, I got to play WarioWare E3.
2838538	2840799	It was one of the few games that didn't have a mile-long line.
2840859	2841460	It was pretty fun.
2841480	2842140	I had a good time with it.
2843081	2843962	Yeah, it's different, man.
2844442	2847964	It's cool to get a group of people to play together in there, you know?
2848304	2852847	It's different than the other games in the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox.
2853128	2857471	I think that game's going to show us just why the Wii is a party console just as much as the GameCube.
2859157	2860238	Yep, I think so too, man.
2860458	2871868	Well, Godfrey, we've got to get to the game we're playing here, which is the year 06 in review, and we've started off with 15 boxes, but now we only have 6 left, so please, pick a number 1 through 6.
2871948	2876512	Alright, so tell them what's going on for this year, man.
2877713	2879995	Well, you've got to tell me what's going on in 2006.
2880235	2882237	You've got to pick one of these boxes, 1 through 6.
2884010	2886972	Let me pick number one.
2887232	2888913	Sounds pretty cool.
2889033	2889674	Number one.
2889714	2890454	Let's open it up.
2891535	2892015	All right.
2894136	2894436	All right.
2894456	2895677	We want to know your opinion.
2895777	2899039	What did you think was the best handheld game in 2006?
2899199	2902421	Ooh, handheld.
2902841	2904642	Ooh, that's a good one.
2906023	2907364	I've been playing a lot of BS.
2907884	2910886	I have to say, in my opinion...
2911850	2913712	Animal Crossing was really cool.
2914553	2915974	I've been playing that a lot.
2915994	2917695	Let me see what else I've been playing.
2917715	2919837	Luminous, also from the PSP.
2919997	2922059	I know that came out, was it last year that came out though, right?
2922159	2923620	But you did have Luminous 2 this year.
2924621	2927744	No, I haven't played it, but I've been playing a lot of Luminous from the Xbox 360.
2927784	2932188	All right, so out of all those games you played, which one would you say was the best?
2935430	2937152	Which version, from the Luminous or...
2937785	2939226	on PSP or the Xbox?
2939346	2943049	Yeah, for any handheld system, which game would you say was the best?
2943489	2944370	Animal Crossing, man.
2944830	2946371	I had a lot of fun with Animal Crossing this year.
2946431	2948133	I've been playing that a lot, a lot.
2948673	2952756	I mean, yeah, I mean, that's the only game I've been playing a lot on the handheld this year.
2953036	2953817	It's pretty addicting.
2953857	2961362	I mean, you can go online with it and, you know, go visit other people's towns and it seems like it doesn't really end ever, that game.
2961903	2964364	Exactly, not only that, it's based on real time, too.
2964424	2965065	So it's like,
2965566	2971371	I wake up and I'll be like, alright, it's daytime over here and I could go online and I might go to somebody else.
2971411	2973332	The time is ahead in their town.
2973993	2980398	Let's say somebody from maybe Europe or Japan and their town is based on their time.
2980758	2982200	So it's like, oh man, it's nighttime over here.
2982220	2982880	Let me check it out.
2983421	2987504	And it's cool because I know Animal Crossing has a great community too.
2987784	2993189	I don't know if you've been checking out this couple of websites called AnimalCrossingCommunity.com
2994581	3000447	Well, people can exchange their friend codes and exchange items and help each other out and stuff.
3000787	3001928	I find that really cool, man.
3001948	3005471	It's different from a lot of other games handheld.
3008114	3008594	You're right.
3008654	3011597	It's unique and it has a huge community behind it.
3011697	3016021	I know that game was in the GameCube, but one thing that was missing was the online part.
3016488	3017490	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3029378	3030318	Oh, for sure, man.
3030919	3034280	Yeah, but get ready, because I'm going to go to your town and do the same.
3034580	3035460	All right, sounds good.
3036881	3038942	We want to get your opinion on a news story as well.
3038962	3043443	Of course, we're going down the highlights of 2006, and I've got to say, you've got a good one here.
3044103	3049666	Actually, you have an audio Daily Double here for the news story, so let's go to the audio.
3050126	3052927	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Harai.
3053347	3054847	Ridge Racer.
3056068	3058849	The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change.
3059514	3061175	and the consumers are ready.
3062416	3066619	Genji 2 is an action game which is based on Japanese history.
3067140	3068721	Ridge Racer!
3069421	3078388	Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.
3079129	3081430	So here's this giant enemy crab.
3082011	3083432	Ridge Racer!
3084528	3088351	and Mew attack its weak point for massive damage.
3088631	3089552	It's Ridge Racer.
3090753	3092194	Ridge Racer.
3092354	3095036	PlayStation 3 will retail for 599 US dollars, 599 US dollars, 599 US dollars.
3095056	3095556	Giant enemy crab.
3095576	3096277	599, 599, 599 US dollars.
3096297	3096857	It's Ridge Racer.
3096897	3097137	Ridge Racer.
3111101	3111901	Yes, that's right.
3112021	3118043	It's Sony's infamous press conference from E3 where they got taunted incessantly afterwards.
3118443	3122044	Godfrey, were you at E3 this year watching it online?
3122764	3127365	As a matter of fact, I got together that day during the press conference.
3128565	3131126	I'm also part of Xbox MVP from Microsoft.
3132446	3137307	It's a lot of community members that got invited to E3.
3137327	3140608	We were there having a couple meetings talking about the Xbox and
3141749	3149794	All of us got together and we wanted to see the press conference of Sony because that's when they were announcing the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii during E3.
3149914	3156979	We were watching it and it was very, very boring, the presentation.
3157539	3164503	I think Nintendo did a really good job this year presenting the Wii and also Microsoft with the Xbox 360, but I don't know.
3164643	3166224	Sony was just straight up boring.
3166345	3166365	I
3167866	3170628	I don't know why it was the hype of the system.
3170648	3173510	Everybody was like, oh my god, the graphics are going to be amazing.
3174230	3178833	And look, ever since E3, that happened.
3179213	3182255	Look now, they've been getting a lot of bad press ever since.
3182755	3185477	What do you think caused all that bad press?
3185537	3186677	Was it the price tag?
3186717	3188538	Was it the giant enemy Krabs line?
3188578	3189299	The Ridge Racer?
3189839	3191340	What caused all the bad press, do you think?
3193021	3194082	I think everything combined.
3194342	3196123	I think the most was the
3196690	3197451	The price, man.
3197851	3199752	You know, like, you know what it is.
3199812	3204916	A lot of people have been busting their butts, man, just to try to get a game because now games are like $60, you know.
3204936	3209679	$59.99, it's like people got to be really picky on what they're going to purchase.
3209759	3218626	And it's like people are like lining up, getting the PlayStation 3, and once they got it, it was like it felt like it was rushed, you know.
3219786	3225290	I think Sony was under pressure big time because of Xbox, especially here in the United States.
3225330	3226291	I know in Japan they're not.
3226604	3230206	They're probably concentrating more on the competition with Nintendo.
3230767	3231848	But I don't know.
3231908	3233749	It just feels rushed.
3233849	3239092	And it's like the online part, it's not like how it is with the 360.
3239253	3246037	I think people are having a better time connecting online where the place isn't portable than the place isn't free.
3247278	3250640	And now with exclusives, it's like Assassin's Creed is coming out of the 360.
3251721	3255564	Like slowly, a lot of Sony fans are...
3256263	3256723	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3285912	3290675	I think that slowly is going to pick up more people to get the PlayStation 3.
3290775	3292496	And also they should lower the price, man.
3292516	3294737	$600 is a little bit too much.
3296038	3307304	I think they were very gassed up that they sold a lot of units with the PlayStation 2 and they thought they were going to do the same thing with PlayStation 3 no matter what price it is.
3307364	3310025	And look, now they're struggling, you know, it's like,
3310954	3312675	I know they're going to learn from that, man.
3312715	3315817	Hopefully, next year, their door is down on the price, man.
3315917	3320699	They've got a lot riding, too, on Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy XIII.
3320739	3323700	Kind of the only big, big, big exclusives I can think of that are left.
3324361	3332205	As a matter of fact, I think PlayStation 2 this year, in the Christmas season, they had a lot of great games, man.
3332325	3335826	A lot like Bully, the new Final Fantasy.
3335847	3337707	They've been getting a lot of great games, man.
3338048	3338368	I think...
3339781	3340581	That's what they need, man.
3340601	3345603	They need companies to create great games for the system.
3346343	3351585	Especially first party-wise, they don't have no great games right now on the system.
3351845	3357207	Nintendo and Microsoft are coming strong with the first party titles.
3357247	3361068	Speaking of great games, that's a good segue into what we want to ask you next, Godfrey.
3361108	3362529	We're tallying it up all night long.
3362849	3365490	What do you believe was the best video game of 2006?
3367682	3369903	Well, to me, man, I think it was Gears of War, man.
3370243	3371344	Gears of War?
3372084	3372904	Yeah, Gears of War.
3373024	3383749	I mean, I know it's not a perfect game, but I think graphic-wise, the sound, everything put together was amazing in that game, man.
3384089	3386990	The only thing that was a little lacking was the story, but it's okay.
3387050	3392153	I think I've been having a blast playing online with my friends and with my brother.
3392273	3394114	We've been doing co-op and all that.
3394414	3394914	I think that's
3395771	3400012	That's, to me, the best game for 2006, Gears of War.
3400132	3403793	And I think the sleeper hit also was Viva Pinata, in my opinion.
3404113	3404573	Really?
3405554	3406314	Yeah, I think so.
3406934	3413376	I think Microsoft did a horrible job promoting the game.
3413396	3419557	I think they were promoting too much on Gears of War, and the attention just went away when Viva came out, you know?
3420337	3422078	So I think that game is really fun.
3422118	3422258	Yeah.
3423413	3429315	Personally, I see this game more for older crowd because it's a little bit too confusing for kids.
3430715	3441999	Godfrey, I would have never have guessed that someone who's been doing this radio program about the Xbox and the hip-hop community combined was secretly an Animal Crossing and Viva Pinata fan.
3443140	3443700	Yeah, man.
3443740	3444440	What's wrong with that?
3445120	3445861	Nothing at all.
3445921	3446461	It's great.
3446661	3449802	It's innovation, man.
3449942	3452743	Companies just got to come out different, man.
3453937	3454998	That's the same thing with music.
3455038	3458220	When everybody's doing the same thing, it gets boring.
3458280	3462222	That's why I love Nintendo, what they're doing with the Wii Control.
3463243	3464523	It's just different.
3465044	3467945	It's like having a different experience while playing the game.
3467985	3472608	You feel like when you're playing Zelda on the Wii, you think you're in the game.
3472628	3475129	It's totally different.
3476030	3480312	Speaking of something totally different, what do you believe was the worst game of 2006, Godfrey?
3482168	3483509	Wow, worst game.
3484149	3486751	Man, I have two choices.
3486831	3493855	Either Superman from the Xbox 360 or this game too, Totem Ball.
3494835	3498237	That was actually free for the Xbox Live Arcade.
3498397	3500839	You could control with the Xbox Live Vision camera.
3501059	3503460	I think that was a really bad game.
3504441	3506802	I was playing it and I just got tired playing it.
3506822	3508563	My arms were falling asleep trying to...
3509397	3511198	I don't know if you got the chance to play that game or not.
3511918	3515400	I unfortunately did and was bored of it in about five minutes.
3516660	3520322	I mean, I unlocked one achievement, so after I unlocked that achievement, I was like, all right.
3520542	3523443	There was one achievement I got really easy by playing the pinball game.
3523463	3528085	There was another game in it that was like a pinball game, and I played it for like two minutes, and I got an achievement somehow.
3529205	3529846	Oh, okay.
3529946	3532267	As soon as you download it, you get an achievement, I guess.
3533867	3536549	You actually played this piece of crap.
3536609	3537209	Five points.
3538226	3539166	Yeah, I don't know.
3539266	3540607	I wouldn't waste my time on that, man.
3540627	3543387	There's a lot of great games on the Xbox Live Arcade.
3543407	3544467	Don't even bother with that one.
3544547	3548408	I'm putting you down for Totem Ball because you ran it a lot longer on that one than you did Superman.
3549768	3551369	All right, all right.
3551409	3552009	Cool, cool.
3552369	3558150	Out of curiosity, do you think the Xbox camera... Because, you know, Totem Ball is kind of like the camera game for Xbox 360.
3558590	3562071	Does the Xbox 360 camera... Can it serve a better purpose than this?
3563391	3564472	Yeah, I think so, man.
3565272	3565572	I mean...
3566593	3573738	I know during the holidays, one of my good friends, he's a podcaster too, but now he works for Microsoft, Chris Palladino.
3575439	3593011	His family, he moved to Seattle ever since he got a job at Microsoft, and during Christmas, they got together with his family in the East Coast and him in the West Coast, and they used the Xbox Live Vision camera to talk, and during Christmas, they went opening presents and all that, so it felt like they were together, you know?
3593091	3593271	Yeah.
3594802	3603045	I think by that or playing games like Uno online, I think it's a great purpose to play that game.
3603085	3605506	Godfrey, thanks so much for being here on the show today.
3605586	3607847	What do you guys have planned over there at Gamertag Radio for 2007?
3607887	3619452	Right now, hopefully in 2007 we're going to launch we're going to still continue with the audio shows, podcasts and also we're working on a video podcast.
3620032	3621893	We're working on that and
3623045	3629007	One of my staff members, Pink Sage, is also working on a project, like a Game Attack Radio magazine.
3630428	3633229	Right now we're keeping it on hold, but it's going to be really cool, man.
3633249	3641652	It's going to be something different, and we're still going to be concentrating on the community because there's a lot of websites that's not getting known, and we're trying to
3642681	3644721	Support them so they can get their name out there.
3644962	3648502	We're going to have a lot of interviews.
3648602	3650743	Are you guys planning to go to CES this year?
3651223	3661105	I don't think any of us are signed up for CES this year, but we're kind of holding out to see hopefully about the new E3 and probably that GamePro Expo and some various anime conventions we'll be going to this year.
3661225	3664625	Just don't know about CES because usually not a lot of game content.
3665205	3666366	Okay, okay.
3666386	3668066	Yeah, well, we're planning to go to CES.
3668166	3668566	That's cool.
3669133	3679478	and we also got invited to a community event in Canada by EA, the NBA Street Home Court that's coming out for the Xbox 360 also.
3679618	3684380	Well, we'll just wait for your video and I'll download it to my video iPod and it'll be like I was there.
3685405	3686506	All right, there you go.
3686526	3691628	I want to thank you and everybody support Orange Lodge, man.
3691688	3692709	I'm a big fan.
3692769	3693149	Thank you.
3693229	3694349	That's what we got to do.
3694390	3697911	We got to get together all the podcasters and continue to work.
3698131	3706315	We do a lot of talking about that, independent podcasts supporting each other, and that's what we wanted to do tonight with our New Year's special is really bring everybody together.
3706375	3711358	So really, we want to thank you for being on board and coming on with this, especially you guys have...
3711718	3716803	They had a lot, a lot of success, so we're very happy you haven't forgotten your independent roots.
3717123	3719545	Tell everybody real quick how they can check out your show, if they want to.
3719885	3728853	Yeah, they could go gamertagradio.com, and we have all the shows in there, and also on iTunes, they could check it out and subscribe to the show.
3729193	3731916	All right, go there right now, everyone, gamertagradio.com.
3731956	3732937	Godfrey, thanks so much.
3733017	3734678	Happy holidays, and good luck in 2007, all right?
3734698	3735139	Happy holidays.
3735199	3736880	All right, take care, man.
3737281	3737741	Thanks a lot.
3744478	3745238	DarkSakura.com
3767104	3768746	I did when I got bored with it.
3784076	3785077	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
3799952	3800332	Pretty good.
3800372	3800833	How about you?
3801053	3801393	Good.
3802174	3805016	Now, you used to come on Orange Launch Radio way back in the day.
3805336	3808319	You came on the Wednesday show with me, and we had a lot of fun there.
3808379	3809940	But what have you been up to in 2006?
3810140	3811682	We haven't heard a lot of you in 2006.
3812662	3815325	A good majority of it has been World of Warcraft.
3815685	3816445	World of Warcraft?
3816525	3816766	Yeah.
3816786	3817827	Are you looking forward to Burning Crusade?
3817847	3818327	Hell yeah.
3819711	3820111	Yep.
3820311	3820591	Alright.
3820851	3822472	You ready to open up a box?
3823012	3823412	Sure.
3823652	3826433	Alright, there's five boxes left on the table, Rice Princess.
3826633	3827393	One through five.
3827453	3828733	Which one of those do you want to open?
3829173	3830534	Box number three, Rob.
3830574	3831474	Alright, let's open it up.
3835635	3838636	Alright, the gaming category we want to know your opinion on.
3839256	3843097	Game I liked this year that no one else seemed to.
3843697	3846777	The game you liked this year that no one else seemed to.
3848098	3849058	Oh, that's a hard one.
3850689	3856775	I didn't do a lot of console gaming this year, and everything that I did play on consoles was pretty well received.
3857356	3859197	So I don't know if I have an answer for that.
3859378	3859718	Uh-oh.
3860018	3861259	We better think of something quick.
3862841	3865403	Well, Elebits.
3866825	3867345	There you go.
3867666	3873191	Well, Elebits did get some bad reviews from some gaming press out there, so I guess that'll work.
3874206	3875147	I have no idea.
3875187	3876948	That just kind of came out of my mouth.
3877268	3877788	That works.
3877828	3878509	We'll take it.
3878789	3879249	Okay.
3879769	3880850	I have never even played it.
3883931	3885812	I just watched it last night for the first time.
3887193	3890135	It's the one that came to most recent memory, so there you go.
3890535	3893877	This is why she hasn't been on the network in a year and a half, ladies and gentlemen.
3893897	3894857	Cry, cry, cry.
3895197	3895578	Just kidding.
3895598	3896178	We still love you.
3896378	3896678	Yay.
3897098	3899840	Well, what were some games that you liked that everyone liked then?
3901165	3903046	Kingdom Hearts 2 came out this past year, right?
3903246	3903846	That was one.
3903967	3904947	I actually did play that.
3905368	3907809	Final Fantasy XII was really good.
3909871	3911252	Twilight Princess was great.
3911332	3914354	I haven't actually played it, but I've seen it played and it looks awesome.
3915295	3917956	Yeah, just the bigger ones that everyone knows about.
3918637	3922680	Here's a news story we want to get your opinion on and that would be, and oh, this is a good one for you.
3922740	3923981	Are you a big fan of the Xbox?
3924721	3925342	No!
3925362	3925402	No!
3926719	3927840	I'm sure you're going to love this one.
3927860	3933382	What we want to know your opinion on is, what do you think of the Halo 3 madness going on out there?
3933702	3937884	Halo 3 was announced at E3 this year, and it's been building and building.
3937904	3942666	There's been all this crazy press coverage leading into a release next year of the game.
3943526	3946348	How important is Halo 3 to the Xbox 360 in 2007?
3948409	3951490	I'm pretty sure it's going to be one of the pillars.
3951830	3956032	I'm sure it's going to be one of the big sellers, but me personally...
3956744	3957204	I don't care.
3957364	3958165	I don't give two shits.
3958345	3958745	Whatever.
3958825	3959786	Why don't you care about Halo 3?
3960407	3962228	Because I didn't care about the first two.
3962248	3963228	I didn't play them.
3963749	3964169	I don't care.
3964189	3965530	Are you just not a first-person shooter fan?
3965930	3966691	Not really, no.
3966711	3967431	All right.
3967471	3967952	Sorry to hear it.
3968752	3968992	Yeah.
3969233	3969513	Okay.
3969893	3973035	Well, Rice Princess, what, in your opinion, was the best video game of 2006?
3976117	3977078	Something that came out in 2006?
3977118	3979900	Yeah, so you can't do World of Warcraft.
3979920	3980160	Sorry.
3980180	3980981	Yeah, dang it.
3981521	3982562	I'm going to say Kingdom Hearts 2.
3982602	3983282	I really enjoyed it.
3984043	3984543	It's a good game.
3984663	3985384	Kingdom Hearts is fun.
3985564	3985804	It is.
3986294	3987435	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4016374	4018896	There wasn't anything you played that you were just like, what a crap?
4019497	4020197	No, not really.
4020377	4020598	Really?
4020638	4022379	I don't play crap, okay?
4022859	4023500	That's why.
4023620	4026342	Then just say Sonic or Bomberman.
4026402	4028244	Sonic or Bomberman, or both.
4029064	4029445	All right.
4029785	4031927	Then we're not putting anything down for you, and you suck.
4032187	4034529	You need to resolve to play more games in 2007.
4034609	4036531	Oh, my God, that's a great resolution.
4036591	4037191	I'll do that.
4037331	4037591	All right.
4037611	4038172	I promise.
4038452	4038732	All right.
4039113	4042836	Let's move over to Extifer is joining us as well from our program.
4042876	4043656	How are you doing, Extifer?
4043816	4044397	Good, and you?
4044758	4044978	Good.
4045018	4048921	Now, you've become more of a gamer in 2006 than you were in 2005, huh?
4049081	4050182	Yeah.
4050282	4051062	And why would you say that?
4051943	4053083	Because of your Wii.
4054664	4055005	Pretty much.
4055025	4056806	My Wii has that effect on people, apparently.
4057246	4060208	I play your Wii all the time, nightly, really.
4061309	4063150	Don't help those rumors that are going around.
4063170	4063750	I watched him do it, too.
4063810	4064211	It was great.
4064291	4065872	And by your Wii, I mean penis.
4065972	4066652	Did I get that?
4067013	4067713	Did I not?
4069551	4071832	Best Game of 2006, Excite Truck Because I unlocked everything in it
4090305	4095108	I played it for hours and hours, and I must like it because I played it for hours and hours.
4095228	4101051	So amongst Burnout, Test Drive Unlimited, you choose Excite Truck?
4101191	4101492	Yes.
4102052	4103893	Why is this game so damn appealing?
4104033	4108136	Because you know a lot of hardcore gamers are passing on Excite Truck because they say it's too junky.
4108156	4116080	They need to play it more, is what I say, because there's a learning curve to it, but once you get past the learning curve, it's so much fun.
4116260	4117081	And I don't understand...
4118642	4124728	It's not the graphics, it's not the trophies or achievements or anything like that.
4125168	4126449	It's the actual gameplay.
4126690	4131234	I really, really like the gameplay and I like the challenges and everything.
4131830	4135211	and on top of that are all the achievements and all the other things that you get.
4135231	4139933	Alright, well everyone here at Orange Lounge Radio is welcome to their opinion, even if they're wrong, which you are in this case.
4139973	4140514	No, I'm just kidding.
4140554	4141474	No, Excite Trek's a lot of fun.
4141494	4142455	I think it was underrated.
4142555	4143935	I really do think it was underrated.
4144215	4149117	I think when it came to racing games this year, I think I like Burnout a little more because there's more fire than there is in Excite Trek.
4149297	4151278	Yeah, no, no, Excite Trek was better.
4151518	4154079	Alright, well what was the worst game of 2006 in your opinion?
4154099	4154139	Um...
4156275	4156916	Sonic the Hedgehog
4186400	4188321	So where did Sega fuck up?
4188701	4193643	They just, they went... See, and I like Sonic Adventure when it came out for the Dreamcast.
4193683	4203988	I really liked that game, so I think they can do it right when they do 3D, but I just, I think their execution and the control and everything was just, it was too much this time.
4204448	4207890	And they could execute it right, because I did like that other game.
4208890	4211111	Alright, well there's four boxes left on the table.
4211191	4212972	Tell me which box do you want to open?
4213532	4214313	Box number two.
4215222	4215963	Like, shit.
4218825	4219865	That's what number two is.
4220146	4222747	Alright, let's open up box number two for Extover.
4226710	4230853	What did you think was the best retro revival of 2006?
4231214	4233835	Meaning, the best game that made a comeback in 2006.
4234256	4239840	I don't have an answer for that.
4240120	4241121	You better come up with one.
4242882	4244263	I think that the best
4246042	4249065	I'm going to say Bomberman Act Zero.
4250266	4251307	Why Bomberman Act Zero?
4251327	4256953	Because it was so goddamn stylish and they just raped all the gamers on that one.
4257013	4259235	I just have to give it to them.
4259295	4260756	Wasn't it Konami that made that game?
4260857	4262118	Yeah, I think so.
4262178	4263239	Hudson's Branch or whatever.
4263259	4265681	Good job, is what I have to say.
4266382	4267463	Best revival ever.
4269246	4271648	I'm getting an orgasm in my pants just thinking about it.
4271668	4275251	Alright, well, speaking of which, we want to know your opinion on news stories.
4276331	4284097	The Nintendo console, because you've been playing a lot of the Wii, and one big news story this year was that originally that system was going to be called the Nintendo Revolution, right?
4284297	4288140	But they changed their mind somewhere along the line, and they decided that
4288444	4291186	The name of the console is going to be the Nintendo Wii.
4291646	4294308	And folks just, you know, they went nuts.
4294428	4298331	They said, like, you know, they made every Wii joke under the sun and still do to this day.
4298671	4301873	What was your reaction when you heard that Nintendo's new console was going to be called the Wii?
4302534	4306737	I think it was a lot like everyone else's, like, huh?
4307257	4308558	Like, what?
4308878	4317064	I don't understand how you can go from Revolution to Wii, but then it really was a good business decision on their part, I think, because...
4317802	4321986	People, it's different, you know, and you'll remember Wii.
4322166	4322887	I mean, you will.
4322947	4325068	It's just one fucking syllable, you know.
4325169	4327571	It's like, I said frucking right there.
4328712	4330433	But anyhow, it's one fucking syllable.
4330693	4335177	And there's also, you know, there's just, everybody knows what it is.
4335478	4337680	You know, it was easier to market, I think.
4337760	4344786	When it was the Nintendo Revolution, it would, I think, be going back, you know, going backwards because...
4345322	4348063	You're used to having video game consoles with those kinds of names.
4349364	4351685	And penis jokes, have you been making a lot of Wii jokes this year?
4352365	4353866	Actually, yes, I have.
4353886	4355727	Can you tell us one of your best Wii jokes?
4358768	4360609	No, no I can't, actually.
4361089	4369353	I can say, though, that when I was waiting in line for the Wii, you pretty much heard every Wii joke you could possibly hear.
4370429	4373630	and that was kind of amusing because everybody was just making them all night.
4373750	4375811	I think a lot of them originated from our part of the line.
4376671	4377191	I wasn't there.
4377251	4377891	I was sleeping.
4378872	4379212	Yeah.
4379552	4381232	I played with my Wii and then went to sleep.
4382193	4382953	We woke you up.
4384553	4384834	It did.
4385294	4385734	All right.
4385814	4390195	Anyway, let's thank you guys to Extifer and Rice Princess.
4390215	4391216	Thank you guys for coming on.
4391256	4391856	We appreciate it.
4391956	4394537	All right.
4394557	4397417	There's three boxes left on the table and, hey, three hosts for the show.
4397537	4399158	So Dark Sakura, one, two, or three?
4400137	4402919	Uh, well, um, two.
4403339	4404179	Two, you want two.
4404239	4405660	Alright, let's, uh, oh, you'll let this one.
4405680	4406400	It's an even number.
4406541	4407701	Alright, here we go, box number two.
4411303	4413204	DarkSakura, the best party game of 2006.
4413324	4416446	Oh, fuck, I don't play party games.
4417446	4417606	Um.
4417847	4419748	Everybody in the studio is getting one they can't do.
4419768	4422389	I changed my box.
4422409	4423009	No, you can't change the box.
4423029	4424250	I returned this one for store credit.
4424270	4424870	No, can't do that.
4425471	4425591	Um.
4425791	4429673	Wasn't there a game that people would get together at your house and play a lot this year?
4430399	4430759	No.
4431059	4431420	Madden.
4432060	4432600	Fuck.
4433761	4434101	No.
4435842	4437463	Okay, I'm going to have to go though.
4437583	4441905	I'm going to go universal with party and say Animal Crossing.
4442365	4442665	Oh, okay.
4443105	4448088	Because I got so many dirty letters from my friends and so many people.
4448628	4457112	I had someone going around in my village calling everyone a wanker and then I had someone also say shit face and it was great.
4457152	4457892	That's so mature.
4458093	4458633	That's awesome.
4459338	4463462	and putting dirty t-shirts in my shop.
4463943	4464643	It was pretty fun.
4465204	4466165	All right.
4466285	4472551	Now, the news story we want to know your opinion on, and that would be, remember when Bully, the game Bully on the PlayStation 2 was first released?
4472951	4478476	Huge controversy when they discovered that your character, a boy, can kiss another boy in the game.
4479197	4480738	What did you think about that whole controversy?
4481839	4482340	I thought that I...
4483122	4487766	I was like, that's cool, but these people are stupid.
4488166	4488607	What people?
4488887	4490689	The people who were all up in arms over it.
4490749	4491509	Like Tack Johnson?
4493231	4493771	Oh, God.
4495012	4498775	That's somebody who just needs to get butt raped with a corncob.
4499556	4503179	Do they need to do more of this type of content in games?
4503439	4503779	Yes!
4504220	4506041	We need more hot gay action!
4506121	4509584	Do you think gay gaming is fairly represented in games today?
4510525	4511465	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4533849	4538312	There are a vast number of people in the world who have normal relationships.
4538652	4545237	I don't think there should be any distinction made between, oh, straight people are normal, oh, gay people, you know, big thing.
4545317	4547718	It should just be no big deal.
4547958	4552842	Yeah, so you think that they don't need to go out of their way to incorporate gay content into the games either.
4552922	4559126	I think it should just be, you know, if you've written this character and this character sets off your gaydar...
4559927	4561207	Have them fuck a guy, I don't know.
4561648	4565689	Then everything should be like The Sims, where it's just play it however the hell you want.
4565709	4570451	The Sims is the best, I think, way they've done it.
4570471	4572711	Because it's either or.
4572831	4580054	And there's tons of gay couples out there who adopt children, who get themselves artificially inseminated, who adopt.
4580854	4583255	I think that it should just be no big deal.
4583335	4584015	It should just be...
4584702	4585303	CookieMama
4607944	4609565	Why did I think you were going to say that?
4609985	4616287	Out of all the games, out of the Kingdom Hearts 2, the Final Fantasy XII, the Oblivions, the Gears of War, you pick Cooking Mama.
4616367	4617428	Because I'm still playing it.
4618288	4620229	And I've been playing it, and I haven't put it down.
4620809	4623170	What's so great, what's so freaking great about Cooking Mama?
4623250	4624431	Pulling the head off a shrimp.
4625951	4626872	Chopping up meat.
4628152	4630653	Are you excited about Cooking Mama Wii that's coming out next year?
4630673	4633154	Yeah, yeah, I want my Cooking Mama Wii.
4633474	4634435	Worst game of 2006, Dark Sakura?
4634455	4634495	Um...
4639013	4640054	Sonic, honestly.
4641135	4641875	I can't help it.
4641975	4644637	It was complete and utter shite.
4645558	4649320	I just was like, oh my god, it's a bad Sonic game.
4649340	4651402	And you have been a Sega fangirl for the longest time.
4651702	4653643	So I asked you what I asked Extifer.
4653683	4654624	Where did Sega go wrong?
4656185	4657646	First of all, putting it on the PS3.
4658807	4661989	And second of all, really crap control.
4662630	4664291	It's just not... it's...
4665396	4672481	I mean, overall, it looked like it had a lot of potential, but there's so much glitchy bullshit in it.
4672941	4686471	I think if they tightened up the control, or maybe even, I don't know if they did, but used the engine from Sonic Adventure, even with the glitches in that game, you could still play through it, and it was a good game.
4686531	4690594	They need to really have that tightness of control that Sonic Adventure had.
4691078	4692579	Alright, well thanks for your opinion.
4692619	4694040	We know you always like to interject it.
4694380	4695561	My opinion is awesome.
4695941	4697482	Loki, there's two boxes left.
4697642	4698102	One or two.
4698482	4699623	Don't be reading off the screen.
4699743	4700203	One or two.
4700323	4701364	I can't see the screen.
4701524	4702024	Good.
4702425	4702785	Two.
4706987	4708168	I'm so glad you picked this one.
4708328	4710729	Best sports title in 2006.
4711710	4713511	Best sports title in 2006.
4715792	4716953	Actually, I would think...
4719175	4722059	Not Tecmo Bowl, they didn't release, well, I guess, Title Legends.
4722179	4723620	No, Title Legends was last year.
4726103	4732511	I would say, actually, probably Wii Sports, since that's really, you know, kind of everyone liked that.
4732691	4733993	It was universally liked.
4734677	4742743	Whereas, like, you know, any EA sports game is pretty much, you know, you're either a fan of it or... So Wii Sports was kind of that game that got people to cross over.
4742803	4744484	Even people that were like, I hate Madden.
4744504	4745445	I don't want to play Madden.
4745465	4746866	Which, you know, can be me sometimes.
4748126	4749007	I loved Wii Sports.
4749027	4749527	It was awesome.
4749748	4750728	Yeah, Wii Sports was fun.
4751209	4753650	And Madden, I'm sure, on the Wii is probably pretty fun.
4754131	4757513	I know a lot of people were getting into that that don't normally like football.
4757693	4762036	I don't follow sports, so, you know, to play a sports game is just kind of, eh.
4763050	4768073	I don't know who anyone is or what the team's strengths and weaknesses are.
4768753	4774296	You kind of have to be a fan of the sport to be able to play the game well, because you have to know the strengths of each player and stuff.
4774636	4780139	And since I don't do that, nor I wouldn't be able to be any good at it.
4780980	4789104	I have to ask you about this one, because I think Wii Sports would have been my answer to this too, but if I went outside that and wanted to pick an actual sports title, I think I actually would have picked Rockstar's Table Tennis.
4790045	4790745	Did you like that game?
4791340	4792921	I didn't really play that game that much.
4793401	4795062	And, no.
4795262	4798905	Table tennis, you know, I still have trouble thinking that that's a sport.
4798925	4799545	It's fun!
4799665	4801786	It was way better than, like, Top Spin 2 was.
4801826	4803407	That was, like, one of the worst games I played this year.
4803908	4804328	I don't know.
4804548	4809311	I would say if I was going to pick a sports game, I would... Well, that's even last year, though.
4809951	4813113	I was going to say Project Gotham Racing 3, because racing is a sport!
4813173	4814014	True, alright, alright.
4814134	4820938	And so, if I were to say this year, then maybe best sports game... Burnout's not a sport.
4821773	4823174	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4841120	4843321	Loki, what are your thoughts on the Eye of Judgment?
4843381	4848704	Does the PlayStation 3 need this, or does it need to just vaporize like it seems to have?
4849144	4861751	I don't know if it's vaporizing, but some other things that they were talking about releasing, like the GPS system for the PSP and the camera for the PSP, those are supposed to be coming out fall of this year.
4862331	4862971	Where are they?
4863752	4863852	Oh!
4864092	4865012	They didn't come out!
4865653	4870355	Well, I guess the GPS came out in Japan, but the more that you think about it,
4871129	4872410	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4896994	4907660	I mean, I can't see anyone actually setting that up to play a card game, which the game on the PlayStation 3 itself does nothing other than kind of visualize, you know, cards.
4907700	4911862	If it was like holographic or something, that'd be pretty cool, but no, it's not.
4911982	4918465	So why would you pay for a $600 console to play this really crappy card game that you have to set up this really elaborate set up to play?
4919586	4923028	And to be honest, they also want you to buy these cards too, which...
4924478	4930442	All anyone has to do is scan it into their computer and you can print it on a piece of paper and play it the exact same way.
4931363	4934565	The whole idea is just utterly retarded.
4935746	4938968	What would you say was the best video game in all of 2006, Loki?
4939229	4942051	That's tough because there's a lot of games out there.
4942751	4948896	I'd say my favorite game of 2006, the one I've been playing the most of, I'd have to say
4950765	4956408	You know, oddly enough, it's a tie between, like, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and Liberty City Stories.
4956448	4961170	Even though Liberty City Stories came out last year, the multiplayer is fun on those.
4961250	4967433	Then Saints Row would have to be up there, too, because Saints Row, I think, right now, Saints Row was the most fun for me on the 360.
4967714	4969294	So which one of those would you put on the list?
4969314	4969755	Saints Row.
4969795	4970275	Saints Row.
4972916	4973236	And why?
4973597	4975418	Just because you love, you love those gun games.
4975438	4978119	I love those Grand Theft Auto, I love sandbox games, and
4978837	5007933	they're just really fun and Crackdown I think is going to be really fun next year but you know I don't know we'll see if Microsoft is able to capture the same kind of feel as that really it doesn't matter next year anyways because once Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out there's no trumping unless they really fuck it up which is possible because they've fucked up the multiplayer every single Grand Theft Auto PSP version that's come out yet we still seem to play it and kind of just you know accept the really glitchiness of the game and I don't know it
5009110	5010491	It'll be fun multiplayer, I think.
5011112	5012353	Alright, and the worst game of 2006.
5012453	5015015	Oh man, the worst game of 2006.
5015836	5022181	You know, everyone's saying Sonic the Hedgehog, and I think they're saying that because it's fresh in their mind, but actually Sonic isn't that bad of a game.
5022321	5027466	I mean, just the controls are a little bit crappy, but I wouldn't say it's the worst game of 2006.
5027926	5035833	If anything, I would go with some of the Ubisoft titles for the Wii that are really awful, like Monster 4x4 World Circuit.
5036700	5049388	But I'd say overall the worst game of 2006, it's got to be Bomberman because Bomberman, it was just a boring game and it wasn't really fun at all.
5050269	5053231	And I don't know, it's just, it's bad.
5053331	5058074	But, you know, if I were to, you know, peg a company as the worst company of 2006, it'd be Ubisoft.
5059369	5061910	Alright, well, there's one box left, so I guess I get to open it.
5062030	5062650	So, here I go.
5087583	5089206	Hey look, I got the million dollars!
5089647	5090068	Woo!
5090749	5093435	Alright, now I got a best use of music in a game.
5094185	5096346	and Hands Down, Elite Beat Agents.
5096406	5096786	Hello.
5097146	5101027	Like, that was one of my favorite, definitely my top three of the whole year was that game.
5101307	5102308	That game is incredible.
5102488	5109210	And, you know, some people criticized it for the song list, but I thought it was actually kind of fun and it made you appreciate maybe songs that you had forgot about.
5109510	5111431	And the covers were, you know, well done.
5111551	5115052	And yes, even Ashley Simpson's song was actually kind of fun in the game.
5115372	5116792	The game's got a great sense of humor.
5116812	5118133	It's one of the most hilarious games I've played.
5118573	5122637	and it keeps you coming back because it's got a lot of difficulty levels in it and multiplayer.
5122877	5125939	The game is incredible and horribly, horribly underrated.
5126220	5128221	I think more people should be checking out Elite Beat Agents.
5128342	5130643	Absolutely the best use of music in a game in 2006.
5131544	5133246	And then the news topic I have would be...
5134215	5136916	The Horse Armor expansion for Oblivion.
5137256	5137937	That was retarded.
5148820	5148920	E.A.
5148880	5149481	's Pay-to-Cheat System
5173883	5180446	It's dumb, especially when you have games like Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter, that the cheats are in there, and you still get achievement points.
5180846	5184608	I mean, granted, you can't use them online, but it's easy achievement points.
5184988	5186148	I mean, that's awesome.
5186168	5187729	You're an achievement point whore.
5187789	5190270	What kind of expansions would you like to see available on Marketplace in 2007?
5190530	5198794	Saints Row would be, you know, what they're doing with Crackdown, for example, they're going to have actually portions of the city that they're going to add later on.
5199174	5199574	That's cool.
5199614	5203276	They've built the game with that kind of expansions in mind.
5204146	5207828	Saints Row would have been cool with some, you know, they're doing like maps and stuff.
5207848	5209509	And actually, they've had some pretty good stuff.
5210570	5214832	Maybe more missions would be kind of cool or like a whole other section of the game.
5215092	5219975	I definitely think in, as far as Xbox 360 goes, you know, they need more RPGs.
5220095	5221515	They need their Blue Dragon this year.
5221575	5223296	They need some of those other titles to come out.
5223676	5225497	And I love SideQuest, man.
5225517	5230740	Those downloadable SideQuest was an awesome idea for Oblivion and really, really adds just hundreds and hundreds of hours to that game.
5230840	5231581	So it's great.
5231941	5232041	Yeah.
5232791	5234432	That is all 15 boxes.
5234512	5235892	We made it all the way through.
5236112	5236572	Can you believe it?
5236612	5237453	Oh, my best and worst.
5237513	5239233	I've got to say mine because we've got to tally it up, huh?
5239853	5240373	You know what?
5240453	5249536	I wish Bethesda would make a game like Oblivion but set in modern day so I can have the guns and be able to exert my power over the woodland.
5249776	5252057	Do you think there will be an Elder Scrolls V, though?
5252357	5255098	Of course there's going to be an Elder Scrolls V. I heard it here first.
5256479	5257539	Of course there's going to be.
5258416	5261158	All right, well, my favorite game of the year, it's really close.
5261258	5266681	I really want to say Oblivion, but, you know, it's a great game, don't get me wrong.
5266701	5271845	It would definitely be my number two pick, but I would say the best game of the year, it has to be Zelda, Twilight Princess.
5271885	5273386	I mean, it really took...
5274216	5277578	Everything that was about... Even though the game was developed originally for the GameCube, yeah, whatever.
5277999	5284603	It really does show what the Wii is capable of doing to what you always thought about the games that you played.
5284804	5285344	You know what I mean?
5286265	5287526	It's a prime example of that.
5287946	5290368	And I think it really is kind of everything the Wii stands for.
5290388	5293670	And it's absolutely the greatest game to have come out this year and well worth the wait.
5294010	5299114	I mean, tons of playability and great puzzles and, you know, just fun.
5299254	5300895	It's a different playing experience...
5301295	5301955	Thank you for watching!
5319417	5319917	My God.
5320618	5326961	I think Bomberman would have been so much better if they just had compacted it to 50 megs and made it an Xbox Live title.
5327301	5331143	The biggest problem with Bomberman is that it was a piece of shit game that they put out for $60.
5331283	5333224	I love you, Konami.
5333244	5338146	You did some great work this year, but this game was somebody made a really bad decision.
5339087	5346170	I'm thinking what happened is that there were some deadlines that had to be met so this game got out and it's just so obvious in the final product.
5346211	5346671	It's not even funny.
5346691	5349092	The problem with some of these companies is they forget that
5349810	5350330	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5373192	5378119	And the whole thing with Bomberman is like, I'm all, wow, that looks kind of cool, you know, when they showed the videos and stuff.
5378700	5385890	It would have been cool as like an action game, maybe like MDK or something like that, you know, where, like, let's just kind of branch the franchise a little bit off
5387098	5390860	And then you could have the party mode or the classic mode or something like that.
5391000	5395984	You're charging people $60 for what essentially is an Xbox Live arcade game.
5396004	5398606	That's the only good aspect of the game is playing it on live.
5398886	5403810	And because the game's $60 and nobody has it, so you can't even find people on live to play it with.
5404631	5407993	They just made some huge mistakes with that game that just ruined it.
5408193	5410996	Absolutely ruined it and made it the worst game of 2006.
5412176	5413337	So now we've got to tally it up.
5413598	5414038	Let's look.
5414733	5416135	Let's see, we're going to tally up the votes.
5416255	5417596	Let's start with the worst game of 2006.
5418397	5432734	It looks like, tallying it up, we had two votes for Totem Ball, two votes for Bomberman, but it looks like between Black Wolf, Extifer, and DarkSakura, Sonic the Hedgehog with three votes is the worst game of 2006.
5432794	5433214	Sorry, Sega.
5436673	5437413	It wasn't that bad.
5437473	5438754	But you know what, though?
5438874	5442835	At least you get a second chance with Sonic and the Secret Rings.
5443415	5449036	I agree they can redeem themselves, but seriously, do a focus group or something with this game next time.
5449816	5451357	Anybody could have told you the controls were fucked.
5451377	5456598	Well, here's the thing, too, is they made this game like Shadow of the Hedgehog, and Shadow of the Hedgehog got shitty-ass reviews.
5457178	5463080	So, the problem is you can only make a Sonic game so fast before it becomes uncontrollable.
5463660	5464940	And just a reminder, some of the other ones...
