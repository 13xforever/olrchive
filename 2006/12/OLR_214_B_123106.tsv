44120	53880	Definitely comes from geek world, this is Travis from Travis Donovan Live.
53880	58520	Alright everybody, help me welcome Travis from Travis Donovan Live to the program, Travis
58520	59520	you there?
59520	60520	Yeah, me here.
60520	61520	How you doing Travis?
61520	66840	Surviving, Iím sitting here in the dark with my pants down.
66840	71200	Hey now, this is a family show, what the heck is going on there, where youíre at, youíre
71200	72700	in Texas right?
72700	78100	We are in Texas and right now we are experiencing typical Texas weather.
78100	80100	Which means?
80100	82440	Thunderstorm warning, tornado watch.
82440	83440	Oh fun.
83440	84920	And no power.
84920	87760	No video games for you then today?
87760	89560	No and I just got my Wii today.
89560	94160	Oh no, how did you finally get a Wii?
94160	101840	With two EB games of all places and just randomly after stopping at GameStop and asked GameStop
101840	107040	first and they said no, they had PS3 then, but now Wii just went to EB Games and said
107040	108040	hey do you got a Wii?
108040	113120	And the guy just looked at me and went ìyeahî and I said ìhook me up my brotherî.
113120	114120	Some stroke of luck.
114120	116120	What games did you get for your Wii?
116120	121760	I got Raymond, the rabid one that everybody hates.
121760	123960	Weíve heard some pretty good things about that from some of the other guests weíve
123960	125460	had on the program.
125460	128560	I figure if everyone else hates it then Iím going to love it.
128560	132880	Alright, well then we definitely want to know your opinion on some of the best and worst
132880	137400	in 2006 because if your opinion is the opposite then that should be kind of interesting.
137400	142960	So we have ten boxes left, please pick a box, one through ten.
142960	145320	Alright weíll go with lucky number seven.
145320	152160	Lucky number seven, here we go, letís open the box and the category we want to know your
152160	156680	opinion on is best game to play online.
156680	159280	What was the best game to play online in 2006?
159280	164320	Well thatís going to be difficult seeing how I didnít play a lot online and it would
164320	166320	have been 360 only.
166320	172000	Iím going to take a book or a page from my family here and Iím going to go with what
172000	178400	they play online all the time and it has to unfortunately be the soul-stealing Final Fantasy.
178400	182120	Final Fantasy XI then on 360, right?
182120	184400	Yes, well no, on PC.
184400	188520	Oh theyíre still playing PC, well weíre going to have to say the 360 version because
188520	191720	the PC one came out a couple of years ago but the 360 one was this year.
191720	194880	Okay well then let me change my damn answer.
194880	198160	Alright, alright, alright, what then?
198160	201840	Best game this year to play online, oh what the hell.
201840	202840	Gears of War.
202840	210320	Gears of War, very popular choice, any particular reason why you chose Gears of War?
210320	215720	I have it for the 360 and I played it online like twice and it was fun.
215720	216880	Have you played the co-op mode?
216880	220840	I hear a lot of people, I think the reason why a lot of folks really enjoy Gears of War
220840	225440	is because of the co-op and not a lot of games encourage co-op.
225440	229480	No because nobody on my friends list bothers to play.
229480	231960	I would play with you Travis at some point.
231960	236240	Okay thatís just kinky and wrong.
236240	240520	Alright then fine, the choice stands as it is and Iím not going to play online with
240520	241520	you.
241520	245000	Alright well then how about this news topic, Iíd be very curious to know your opinion
245000	251040	on this, earlier this year there was a TV station that used to represent gamers a long
251040	256100	time ago that changed their slogan earlier this year and that was G4 Television and their
256100	259960	new slogan as of earlier this year was ìWe Get Guysî.
259960	264280	You ever watch a G4 TV Travis?
264280	270240	Unfortunately I have accidentally stumbled upon it because on my channel listing itís
270240	276320	awfully close to BBC America and stuff like that so I accidentally tuned into it.
276320	281720	I see, did you ever watch G4 Tech TV back in the day right when they first merged?
281720	286640	In its heyday, well actually before it merged, Tech TV was the bomb.
286640	291160	It was the ìshiz nitî as they say in the ghetto.
291160	295120	It was the best thing for geeks and gamers out there.
295120	299520	Then when G4 took over it was fine, it was okay, there were some bumps in the road but
299520	305440	unfortunately now it is what I like to call a partial birth abortion of a network.
305440	308400	What happened, what went wrong?
308400	314520	They have no idea or concept of how to program a network around gaming and technology.
314520	323080	Theyíre too ratings conscious and unfortunately they have a talent pool which makes a West
323080	329120	Virginia gene pool look like genius status.
329120	333240	Do you think that thereís a need out there for a video game network or do you think online
333240	336640	kind of fills that void?
336640	338080	The internet of course fills it.
338080	340080	It fills it extremely well.
340080	345840	There are tons of sources whether youíve got your GameSpot, your IGN, your 1UP, your
345840	349840	joystick, whatever.
349840	356080	Print wise, magazine wise you also have a plethora of magazines you can buy.
356080	361360	Television wise it would be good to have somebody or a network that wasnít jockeyed one way
361360	370600	or the other by advertising dollars to sort of twist their slant on gaming in the industry
370600	376760	because Iíll tell you right now you can tell on G4 that the almighty dollar really does
376760	380120	affect some of what they say on that network.
380120	383440	Iím not a big fan of that network.
383440	389360	I think what theyíve done to my holy grail which is Star Trek is ridiculous and stupid
389360	397880	with that whole 2.0 shit, pardon my English, and now theyíre showing cops.
397880	398880	Iím sorry.
398880	400520	Cops are going to be onÖ
400520	405400	I was flipping the other day and I saw cops on there and I was like wow, itís very interesting.
405400	411920	Why do you think then people continue to in the gaming world care about G4 because I noticed
411920	417320	that once in a while game blogs and game sites run these stories on G4 television and I canít
417320	420800	help but personally wonder and I know weíve talked about it on our own program previously,
420800	425760	why do people continue to care if G4 is not giving the gamer world what we need?
425760	430080	Why is the gamer world continuing to give them free press?
430080	435600	So long as you have any type of mass media outlet, everybody is going to try to take
435600	440880	advantage of as many of those outlets as possible and G4 is one of those.
440880	449360	You have the talking heads on that network which are there to shield their products and
449360	454680	thatís why people still care unfortunately about G4.
454680	464280	I give G4 credit to be one of the very few Americanized networks that actually employ
464280	477560	a shemale, Morgan Webb, and a spasmatic schizo with severe bipolar disorder, Adam Sessler,
477560	483920	and the rest of their lineup and I love how they steal British interactive television
483920	491040	game shows and claim them as their own, i.e. that late night video game or that game call-in
491040	502800	show that they do which is a steal from a British show that they do over there.
502800	506800	So long as theyíre on the air, game companies will use them as an outlet to shield their
506800	514240	products because the attention span of the American public is that of a fruit fly.
514240	517240	Theyíll get their media anywhere they can.
517240	521080	We here at Orange Lounge have given them too much airtime as it is so we need to move right
521080	522080	on to the next topic.
522080	523800	But thank you for your input.
523800	529200	What did you think was the best video game of 2006, weíre tallying it up tonight?
529200	534560	The best game of 2006, again, Iím going to fall back on is Gears of War just because
534560	539600	it took the first person shooter, it really didnít ratchet up a notch as far as the style
539600	547240	of gameplay, itís still the same run, duck, cover, shoot, but the graphics quality, I
547240	552800	think itís the first true game of 2006 to take advantage of the next gen console and
552800	556720	itís going to be interesting to see how this plays out with the other next gen console,
556720	557720	the PS3.
557720	561920	I donít throw the ìweî into the category of next gen because graphics-wise itís the
561920	567000	same but the 360 and the PS3, youíre finally seeing the developers get a hold of this and
567000	568520	Iím looking forward to 2007.
568520	573360	I think ìweî tries to classify itself more as a ìnew genî than ìnext genî, so it
573360	575760	could be interesting to see how that all plays out.
575760	576760	It is.
576760	580560	I mean, the ìweî is definitely revolutionary and it is going to be fun to play and itís
580560	583040	going to be innovative and itís going to be fun to see how publishers take advantage
583040	584040	of that as well.
584040	586320	All right, what was your worst game of 2006?
586320	589840	Oh, God, we donít have enough time on the show.
589840	601440	Iím going to go from a standpoint of a letdown as far as genre is concerned and that would
601440	603040	have to be Star Trek Legacy.
603040	606320	Ooh, wow, why is Star Trek Legacy?
606320	615940	The single-player story missions are incredible and theyíre fun and the graphics are great
615940	620880	and itís great that you have the voice of all the captains and that partís wonderful.
620880	626720	Whatís killing this game from being as hot as Bridge Commander was on the PC, and as
626720	631480	I went into it on my show, is the multiplayer.
631480	634360	The multiplayer on this game literally sucks.
634360	641320	I mean, it sucks big floppy donkey dongs, so half the time you canít even get into
641320	648000	a game, you get kicked out, the connections are horrid, the lag times are not bad when
648000	652000	you finally get a game, but the problem is getting a game.
652000	655520	You think itís possible maybe the developers will push a patch out that hopefully will
655520	657080	fix some of it?
657080	663160	Well, they were quick to push a patch out for the multiplayer on the PC.
663160	668840	They literally had that out the same day it was released on PC, but Legacy was a port
668840	674240	from 360 to PC, so that was because they were having problems with GameSpy and GameSpy is
674240	678040	well known for having compatibility issues with games anyways.
678040	683600	But if there was going to be a patch, it would have been out by now and I donít think.
683600	688640	I think Bethesda Soft is just taking CBS Biocomís money and saying, ìHere, we gave you three
688640	696200	games, thank you for the money, good luck and thanks for all the fish,î kind of thing.
696200	701560	I know Star Trek is something near and dear to your heart because you do the sci-fi program
701560	704680	here on Orange on Saturday night, yes?
704680	707480	Not so much sci-fi anymore, but yes.
707480	711800	What exactly can the fans expect to hear when they tune into Travis Donovan Live on Saturdays?
711800	716560	Thatís great, being the station manager and such as you are, keeping up to speed with
716560	720320	the shows, Rob.
720320	727640	I do throw a little sci-fi and geek into it, of course, but Iím now getting to the point
727640	732880	where Iím so pissed off with the morons in television and the morons on the internet
732880	738640	totally infecting reality that itís time that reality gets put back in its place and
738640	740240	thatís what my showís all about.
740240	746200	Itís enough of hearing about Britney Spearsí coup and Lindsay Lohanís drunken tirades.
746200	750680	Itís time to slap people upside the head with a large fish and get them to realize
750680	752440	thereís more important things in this world.
752440	754000	So youíre the angry geek?
754000	760120	Iím the angry, pissed off, motherfucking, hetero white middle-aged man.
760120	765280	Well, Iím not so much middle-aged, but for your listeners, I would be considered middle-aged.
765280	772440	Itís sort of what Travis Donovan Live is all about now.
772440	775200	The tagline is putting reality back in its place.
775200	779320	What are you looking forward to most in the geek world in 2007?
779320	782120	Not necessarily games, but anything.
782120	783120	Anything geek?
783120	790440	Well, Iím interested to see how well Vista plays out when Windows Vista releases, how
790440	792680	well of an operating system thatís going to be.
792680	797280	Is it just going to be fancy new graphics and user interface, or is it actually going
797280	802960	to be something substantial, because nowadays itís so easy to steal information and corrupt
802960	804520	data via the internet.
804520	810760	Iím just wondering how much more secure Vista is going to be.
810760	815040	Itís already been hacked, from what I understand, so thatís not a good sign.
815040	819080	The rest of technology, thatís up in the air right now.
819080	820960	Things are moving at such a pace.
820960	824080	Itís always fun to see what the Japanese bring out.
824080	830080	They bring out robots to help the invalid, so Iím hoping soon theyíll bring out a robot
830080	833400	thatíll help wipe my butt, because again, Iím a lazy American and I donít like to
833400	836000	do that.
836000	839160	On that note, I think we should probably say goodbye.
839160	841720	Thanks so much for being on the program tonight.
841720	842720	Oh, good.
842720	845920	Letís end the call on the brown note.
845920	847560	Thatís great.
847560	850480	Or as weíve called it on the show previously, the brown eye of judgment.
850480	853600	We should have to go back to the archives for that one.
853600	856800	TravisDonovanLive.com for more information on the program.
856800	861080	Saturday nights here on Orange Launch Radio, and podcasts on your own site too, yes?
861080	863480	Oh my God, you remembered the URL.
863480	864480	I did.
864480	865480	Pay attention.
865480	868040	I podcast via my site.
868040	870400	Iím also on iTunes.
870400	872000	Search him out, Travis Donovan.
872000	875320	Thanks so much for being here, and best of luck to you in í07.
875320	876320	No problem.
876320	884120	Hopefully itíll be great.
884120	888760	For those that donít know, if you go way, way back in the broadcast history of myself
888760	892760	in Dark Sakura, we actually started on a show with Travis.
892760	895680	He did a long time ago called Understation Alive, and heís still pretty funny after
895680	897600	all these many, many, many years.
897600	901360	I was the fill-in person slash most frequent guest.
901360	904720	Yes, and I was the gay guy that was on the show, I guess.
904720	907360	I donít know what the hell my role was there, but we didnít get to talk a lot of games
907360	908800	back then.
908800	912640	I remember one of the biggest interviews we ever had is we interviewed the guy who ran
912640	915000	the bunny ranch on our program.
915000	919360	I remember making the calls to pay phones in Disneyland.
919360	920360	So that was a weird show.
920360	923600	That was kind of a shock job kind of show.
923600	925720	How did the pay phone calls go?
925720	926720	Someone answered one.
926720	927720	We did get one.
927720	930840	From what I remember, we had somebody answer it once, and we actually had a conversation
930840	935160	with them, but then we called back and the call mysteriously dropped, and we were theorizing
935160	939160	that the Disneyland police had tapped our conversation and dropped the calls, because
939160	942520	you know Disneylandís got some scary security.
942520	947600	The whole point of it, though, is that they are presentingóthis is why all the stuff
947600	951920	that happens around the park is called behind the scenes for a reason.
951920	954700	Everythingóthe employees are cast members.
954700	958000	Everything there is sent to present something, and a phone callóthey donít want to get
958000	959000	in the way of that.
959000	960000	All right.
960000	963800	Well, speaking of craziness, our next guests are crazy, but in a good way.
963800	964800	Yes, Dark Sakura?
964800	965800	Yeah.
965800	974440	We have Franz here and Ron Workman from Destructoid.com.
974440	975440	All right.
975440	980000	We are joined here now on our Orange Ons Radio year-end special with one, two, three people
980000	983720	joining us from the website Destructoid.com.
983720	985000	Say hello, everybody, to Franz.
985000	986000	Franz, you there?
986000	987000	This is Franz from Destructoid.
987000	988000	Hey, how you doing, Franz?
988000	989000	Man of many words.
989000	990000	Yeah.
990000	994000	And the voice you hear there is Ron.
994000	995000	Hey.
995000	996000	How you doing?
996000	997000	Hey.
997000	998000	Graybush Workman.
998000	999000	How you doing?
999000	1000000	Graybush in the house.
1000000	1001000	Thanks for having us.
1001000	1002000	Not a problem.
1002000	1003000	And also joining us, say hello to Shir.
1003000	1004000	Whatís up, guys?
1004000	1005000	Yeah.
1005000	1006000	I donít have anything to say.
1006000	1007000	Iím boring.
1007000	1008000	Thatís all right.
1008000	1011160	We often donít either, but we somehow fill three hours every week.
1011160	1013920	Iím so fucking laid back.
1013920	1019540	So you guys all blog for the Destructoid.com website, but do you guys participate in their
1019540	1021520	podcast as well, Podtoid?
1021520	1022520	Occasionally.
1022520	1023520	Yeah, sometimes.
1023520	1024520	Usually, Ron.
1024520	1027800	Yeah, Iím usually turning into the comic relief for the show.
1027800	1032080	They beg, but I have things to do to leave me alone.
1032080	1034960	How many bloggers do they have over at Destructoid?
1034960	1038560	Because when Iím looking at the list of people, it looks like Iím looking at a picture of
1038560	1039560	The Last Supper or something.
1039560	1040560	There are so many people.
1040560	1042360	I think what are we looking at?
1042360	1048160	Probably mid to high 30s, I mean in January weíre maybe looking at over 40, hopefully.
1048160	1049160	Wow.
1049160	1050160	Yeah.
1050160	1051160	A couple more people.
1051160	1056640	Weíve got well over a dozen people that post daily and consistently and stuff like that,
1056640	1062480	and thatís kind of our thing, what weíre shooting for, is to update information.
1062480	1066680	Gregory made a joke last night, hey, weíre the only website that posts at 3.30 in the
1066680	1067680	morning every day.
1067680	1068680	Yeah.
1068680	1071320	Weíve got people that are up all night messing around with stuff.
1071320	1074200	So you guys really are an army of robots when you say that.
1074200	1075760	It seems that way.
1075760	1078800	Weíre turning into the Detroit Army, I guess.
1078800	1079800	All right.
1079800	1082880	So weíre going to pick the Armyís brain here a little bit on some of the gaming topics
1082880	1087440	in a little game we call Year in Review 2006.
1087440	1092840	So we have nine boxes left, because people have been plucking all the other boxes.
1092840	1094020	And Franz, weíll start with you.
1094020	1095680	Which box do you want to open up?
1095680	1097800	Box one through nine, any one of them.
1097800	1100440	If thereís a PS3 in it, Iím returning it, though.
1100440	1101440	Weíll see.
1101440	1103880	Iíll go with nine.
1103880	1109080	Box nine, letís take a look.
1109080	1115080	We want to know, Franz, what did you think was the most creative game in 2006?
1115080	1116640	Damn.
1116640	1119280	Most creative game in 2006.
1119280	1120280	Come on.
1120280	1121280	Viva Pinata.
1121280	1122280	Viva Pinata.
1122280	1123280	Actually, no.
1123280	1124280	Ronís actually got a point.
1124280	1125280	Itís one of the two games heís played.
1125280	1126280	Viva Pinata.
1126280	1130960	When you get a game where you re-rate the engine to make it look more kitty, and itís
1130960	1135660	mating animals that dance around for the whole game, thatís pretty damn creative.
1135660	1137160	You said there was two going around in your mind?
1137160	1138840	What was the other one, out of curiosity?
1138840	1142320	No, that was just the only game around in Wartmanís Blotting this year.
1142320	1145280	Oh, I see.
1145280	1147600	Is Viva Pinata really for kids, though?
1147600	1151600	Because I know when I played it, I was like, if I was seven, my controller would be through
1151600	1152600	the window right now.
1152600	1153600	Itís going to be tough for kids to understand it.
1153600	1155520	Itís like Pokemon in the sense that anybody can enjoy it.
1155520	1157480	Like, I played Pokemon, and that was a great game.
1157480	1158480	I donít know.
1158480	1162960	Thereís some stuff in Viva Pinata that my gray bush ass couldnít figure out how to
1162960	1163960	do, thatís for sure.
1163960	1164960	I know.
1164960	1165960	I was getting frustrated with Viva Pinata.
1165960	1169080	I was looking stuff up on the internet, and people were feeling bad for me, like, ìHere,
1169080	1172520	Iíll send you Pinata Vignata.î And Iím like, ìNo, I want these damn mice to have
1172520	1175240	sex.î And weíre all of a sudden fucking Mensa.
1175240	1178800	My Vignattas kept beating each other.
1178800	1180800	It was like Lord of the Wise.
1180800	1181800	Yes.
1181800	1182800	Horrible.
1182800	1185960	So Viva Vignata, most creative game.
1185960	1190520	Franz, the newest topic we want to know your opinion on, and I donít know if you have
1190520	1195760	any friends over in the UK, but it seems like one of the recurring themes in 2006 is that
1195760	1199920	our buddies in the UK keep getting the shaft.
1199920	1202840	I think thatís when the story of their lives, thatís definitely true.
1202840	1209480	Why does Britain keep getting fucked over when it comes to release dates or system launches,
1209480	1210480	prices of games?
1210480	1213000	Why do they keep getting picked on?
1213000	1215640	I think itís a shame.
1215640	1219760	If Microsoft would jump on that and divvy up their sales a lot more, I think that would
1219760	1220760	give them a lot more price.
1220760	1225040	Now, didnít the Wii just come out two days ago or something?
1225040	1226720	They could barely do pre-sales over there.
1226720	1227720	No, like two days.
1227720	1229360	They came out like two weeks ago.
1229360	1230360	Oh, okay.
1230360	1232560	And theyíre waiting until March, I guess, to do the PlayStation over there?
1232560	1234360	Yeah, then I mean you get a taste of it.
1234360	1235360	Jesus.
1235360	1237840	Well, hell, half the United States didnít get a taste of it in there.
1237840	1242160	Although itís important to note too that they banned games thatís kind of unnecessary
1242160	1243160	too.
1243160	1248280	Like even Rule of Rose and stuff, so maybe theyíre hesitant to help them out any time
1248280	1249280	soon.
1249280	1250280	Did you guys play Rule of Rose?
1250280	1251280	It wasnít that bad.
1251280	1252280	I didnít think it was that bad.
1252280	1254280	I heard it was terrible.
1254280	1259280	The game itself is kind of something I feel like I played before, but I mean the game
1259280	1260280	was okay.
1260280	1263280	I certainly played worse games this year, but I didnít think the story was that bad.
1263280	1266040	It just involved sexual themes that kind of had kids.
1266040	1267880	What was that out on?
1267880	1268880	PS2.
1268880	1269880	PS2.
1269880	1270880	Yeah.
1270880	1271880	It was easy.
1271880	1275160	I just think the problem with Rule of Rose, it was a full-price title, wasnít it?
1275160	1277240	It was like a $49.99 they wanted for it?
1277240	1278240	Yeah.
1278240	1281240	Yeah, so that was the biggest problem is because PS2, you know.
1281240	1285400	Well, thatís just Atlus because theyíre retarded and still think they can get $49.99
1285400	1289360	for a PlayStation 2 game at the end of its life cycle, so.
1289360	1294240	Well, you know, I guess if Square can get $59 for a collectorís edition of Final Fantasy
1294240	1296240	XII, which has nothing special, by the way, nothing special.
1296240	1300200	Oh, Final Fantasy XII, I love this in Final Fantasy.
1300200	1301200	It is a sexy game.
1301200	1302200	Iíll give you that.
1302200	1303200	All right.
1303200	1308080	And itís actually GameStop that thinks they can get $59.99 for the special edition of
1308080	1309080	Final Fantasy XII.
1309080	1311720	Well, they got it from me, but thatís because Iím a corporate whore.
1311720	1313640	Shira, itís your turn.
1313640	1315360	Why donít you pick a box?
1315360	1317040	Now we have one through eight left.
1317040	1320200	Hmm, Iíll pick number three.
1320200	1321200	Box number three.
1321200	1325560	Letís open it up.
1325560	1326560	Box number three.
1326560	1327760	Oh, this is a good one.
1327760	1331760	What do you believe was the most disappointing game of 2006?
1331760	1336880	Hmm, Iím going to get a lot of flak for this.
1336880	1338200	Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.
1338200	1339200	Oh, snap.
1339200	1340200	Ouch.
1340200	1343200	Why, uh, why Zelda Twilight Princess?
1343200	1346720	I donít know, because Zeldaís the type of game where everyoneís like, this game is
1346720	1349800	better than unicorns fucking pixies.
1349800	1350800	But itís not.
1350800	1351800	Itís not so great.
1351800	1352800	And that would be great.
1352800	1353800	I donít know about you guys.
1353800	1354800	Thatís funny.
1354800	1357400	Thatís exactly how I described it on the last episode of Orange Lounge.
1357400	1358400	Itís amazing.
1358400	1359400	I was likeÖ
1359400	1361400	Yeah, but everyoneís like, this is going to be the greatest game ever.
1361400	1364400	And then I played it and I was like, yeah, this isnít the greatest game ever.
1364400	1365400	I donít know.
1365400	1368400	My only little comment for that is it came out two years late.
1368400	1369400	Yeah.
1369400	1371400	Itís part of the thing that makes it a disappointment.
1371400	1372400	Sure.
1372400	1376200	Is that the problem for you, is that this is essentially a GameCube game with Wii controls?
1376200	1377200	Well, no.
1377200	1378200	Thatís not the problem.
1378200	1380400	Itís just that I donít really like Zelda then.
1380400	1387400	Like, I like games in that genre, I like Ocarina of Time is okay, I like Majoraís Mask, like
1387400	1388400	Wind Waker.
1388400	1392400	But this one is just, like, boring, thereís no real character depth, and I was just like,
1392400	1393400	yeah, fuck this.
1393400	1394400	All right.
1394400	1397400	Iím going to chime in on what they think the most disappointing game of 2006 was.
1397400	1401400	Rare didnít come out with anything, did they?
1401400	1402400	No, perfect.
1402400	1403400	Thatís a lie.
1403400	1405400	Didnít they just release Viva Pinata?
1405400	1406400	Viva Pinata?
1406400	1407400	Oh, yes.
1407400	1408400	It is.
1408400	1409400	Thatís a rare game.
1409400	1410400	I donít know whatÖ
1410400	1411400	Oh, no, Novadrome.
1411400	1412400	Novadrome for Xbox Live Arcade.
1412400	1413400	Why Novadrome?
1413400	1414400	Oh, it was garbage.
1414400	1415400	It killed me.
1415400	1416400	Have you played it?
1416400	1417400	Yeah, I have.
1417400	1418400	I have.
1418400	1419400	I have.
1419400	1420400	I have.
1420400	1421400	I have.
1421400	1424960	It was just, you look at it, itís like $10 for this thing.
1424960	1429960	It was like a really bad, like, I only played a few minutes, it was that bad that I was
1429960	1434400	just laughing, but $10 for a game thatís a real bad twisted metal.
1434400	1436400	Oh, Red Steel 2, Novadrome.
1436400	1438400	Red Steel was atrocious.
1438400	1441400	Can you believe they green-lighted a sequel to Red Steel?
1441400	1446400	Yeah, because I think a lot of people were really looking forward to it and really, like,
1446400	1449400	looking for all the new concepts and theyíre like, yeah, letís do this.
1449400	1452400	Iím looking for all the new concepts and theyíre like, man, this is going to be the
1452400	1453400	greatest game ever.
1453400	1456400	And Ubisoft, when they released it, everyone was like, well, this isnít that good.
1456400	1458400	There are a lot of things you could do better.
1458400	1462400	So Ubisoft is going to take that into account, make a better game with the, you know, the
1462400	1465400	similar core gameplay, and itís just going to be fucking awesome.
1465400	1467400	I realize thatís what I hope happens.
1467400	1468400	All right.
1468400	1469400	Weíll see.
1469400	1473920	Shir, the news topic I want to know your opinion on has to do with the price ranges for video
1473920	1475900	game systems in 2006.
1475900	1479760	We heard at one point that, you know, even though I think most of us knew this was BS,
1479760	1482160	but the revolution was going to be $99.
1482160	1484480	This is when it was still called the revolution, not the Wii.
1484480	1488640	And then, you know, suddenly it was, okay, 250, more reasonable, probably what we expected.
1488640	1493280	But then all the way up to $600 for the PlayStation 3 or $500 for the low end, depending on how
1493280	1494280	you look at it.
1494280	1497880	So weíve had systems cost anywhere at one point or another in theory or whatever it
1497880	1500440	would be, $99 to $600.
1500440	1505780	How important do you think price is of these systems in the console wars that are going
1505780	1507680	on here in 2006 and on into í07?
1507680	1512880	Iím glad I got this topic because Iím broke as hell, so this is just the perfect topic
1512880	1513880	for me.
1513880	1516720	And itís a big factor for me when Iím buying systems.
1516720	1519400	For example, I donít have a 360 because Iím broke.
1519400	1525320	Itís like 400 bucks and you canít play without live, really, and then it requires a yearly
1525320	1527600	fee that I really donít have because Iím broke.
1527600	1528600	No.
1528600	1529600	400 bucks live comes with it.
1529600	1530600	Shut the hell up, Ron.
1530600	1531600	You always miss that.
1531600	1535440	You always see these press releases and theyíre like, and then youíve got to buy live.
1535440	1537240	So it comes with it for 400 bucks.
1537240	1539240	Dude, the gold package or whatever.
1539240	1540480	Well, who gives a shit?
1540480	1542680	If you want to play games online, you can play with silver.
1542680	1544560	Thereís no difference aside from multiplayer.
1544560	1548200	You canít have four people on your Xbox plan.
1548200	1550640	Goldís a better color.
1550640	1551640	It is.
1551640	1553960	We have to be 24.
1553960	1557440	And yeah, so anyway, Wiiís $250.
1557440	1559960	I thought it was going to be cheaper instead of everyone else, but I really didnít care
1559960	1562000	because I could scrape up $250.
1562000	1567520	I canít scrape up $400 because I suck, and the PS3 is just way out there, and even if
1567520	1569880	you want to go on eBay, itís like a grand.
1569880	1571880	And so yeah, itís a bit ñ
1571880	1575360	Dude, for such dollars, go buy a cheap remote, spray paint it white, and spray paint your
1575360	1576360	GameCube white.
1576360	1577360	Youíve got to Wii.
1577360	1578360	No, you donít.
1578360	1579360	Neither one of them can play BBB.
1579360	1582360	I canít argue with you, Ron, because youíre just the biggest dick in the world.
1582360	1583360	They both have subpar graphics.
1583360	1585200	But you canít play Elibits on the GameCube.
1585200	1587200	That makes a point.
1587200	1589240	Theyíre not going to drop that.
1589240	1591240	Theyíre not going to push it out on the ñ
1591240	1594240	I guess there wouldnít be any way to do it with the controls.
1594240	1595240	Damn right.
1595240	1596240	You just lost.
1596240	1597240	All right.
1597240	1598240	Well, we got to keep it moving here.
1598240	1599240	Thanks.
1599240	1600240	Thanks for your input.
1600240	1601240	Letís move on over to Graybush.
1601240	1602240	Oh, great.
1602240	1606240	Please be a question about how to get rid of crabs.
1606240	1608000	Please be how to get rid of crabs.
1608000	1609000	One through seven.
1609000	1610000	Take your pick.
1610000	1611500	I will take number four.
1611500	1612500	Number four.
1612500	1617880	Letís open up case number four.
1617880	1621400	Most downloadable content for a game.
1621400	1623600	Oh, content?
1623600	1626520	Oh, God.
1626520	1628440	Youíre going to brag on me on this one.
1628440	1632240	I hate to say this, but the damn UNO player packs.
1632240	1633240	Really?
1633240	1637960	Are you a big cameo card fan?
1637960	1641200	The thing I had the most fun with this year is all ñ
1641200	1642200	Iím coming out of the closet, Ron.
1642200	1643200	I know, man.
1643200	1644200	Iím Ricky Martin all over again with this.
1644200	1647800	Iím just ñ I canít ñ best downloadable add-on to a game.
1647800	1651360	Well, Call of Duty map packs, obviously, were cool for me.
1651360	1652600	Well, I thought you said UNO.
1652600	1654000	I thought we were going with UNO here.
1654000	1655400	Well, Iím just trying to think.
1655400	1657640	Iím arguing back and forth here.
1657640	1665560	Iíd say Call of Duty map packs I probably had the most fun with, but the UNO stuff got
1665560	1667120	me to play UNO for some odd reason.
1667120	1671640	Iíd be on Xbox Live and have all this money in this machine, and weíd be sitting there
1671640	1675360	on our video cameras chatting with each other on UNO, and it was just like, what kind of
1675360	1678560	revolution is this?
1678560	1682240	I would have to be a tie between the stupid add-on packs that actually got me to play
1682240	1688360	UNO and stay up all night with people bullshitting on there, and the Call of Duty 2 maps.
1688360	1692160	Does it have anything to do with the webcams on UNO?
1692160	1695640	Thatís one news story that didnít quite make our cut for being included tonight.
1695640	1700440	When they first came out, it was really funny because there would be three or four of us
1700440	1706640	in a room and weíd be like, ìOh, look, thereís somebodyís ass and somebodyís boobs.î
1706640	1710000	I guess the novelty wore off real quick, but it was a really funny thing.
1710000	1715440	But it was cool because I could sit on my back porch and smoke cigarettes and play UNO
1715440	1718440	because the controller vibrates when itís your turn, and UNO is so hard you just hit
1718440	1719440	the A button.
1719440	1720440	You donít even have to look at the screen.
1720440	1723560	I mean, seriously, there would be media nights Iíd be sitting outside smoking a cigarette.
1723560	1726880	I couldnít even see, but Iíd be chatting on my headset.
1726880	1729360	When the controller vibrated, I hit the button and it would throw a card out there because
1729360	1731540	it doesnít matter, itís UNO.
1731540	1735720	Playing UNO on live is weird for me now because I feel like Iím always playing against lonely
1735720	1738280	girl 15 with the webcam.
1738280	1745040	But itís one of those things where I never expected to have fun ever, ever playing UNO.
1745040	1746800	I never even expected to play UNO.
1746800	1750120	When we get in there, itís just a bunch of us friends and we bullshit and we have a good
1750120	1751120	time.
1751120	1755360	Itís not as much about UNO gameplay, but I remember when we added the new decks to
1755360	1757880	it and changed the game and we started playing with strategy.
1757880	1762600	It was like, ìWeíre actually playing fucking UNO.î It was one of those types of things
1762600	1765480	where somebodyís done something right if weíre actually playing UNO.
1765480	1769560	Now, are you guys big on the shit-talking on UNO, like drop form, motherfucker, and
1769560	1770560	things like that?
1770560	1773560	Yeah, but itís always joking.
1773560	1776360	Reverse bitch.
1776360	1781960	Speaking of fun games, the news story we wanted to ask you about would be Guitar Hero because
1781960	1786520	we obviously had Guitar Hero 2 come out this year, which is the sequel to a monster hit
1786520	1791400	last year, and then they announced, and this is still a bit of a rumor status, but that
1791400	1796000	thereís going to be a quartet of new Guitar Hero games coming out through the next year.
1796000	1799000	You know, the one on the 360 and so on and so on.
1799000	1802280	Is too much Guitar Hero too much of a good thing?
1802280	1806880	Iíve never played it because itís a video game that involves me dancing around with
1806880	1808360	a plastic toy guitar.
1808360	1809920	And yet you play UNO and you wonítÖ
1809920	1814320	There is nothing thatís ever going to be cool about a grown man dancing around with
1814320	1816040	a plastic toy guitar.
1816040	1817040	I know.
1817040	1818040	I get you.
1818040	1819040	You play fucking UNO.
1819040	1822160	Sitting on the back porch playing UNO smoking cigarettes is fucking rad, huh?
1822160	1823160	Yeah, I know.
1823160	1825400	Iím not beat to answer around with a plastic guitar.
1825400	1827400	It looks to me like a rock star.
1827400	1831120	Guitar Hero is like the lamer version of DDR for me.
1831120	1835120	I know people love it and get into it, but itís just like you play it with a plastic
1835120	1836120	toy.
1836120	1839920	It would be like me playing Call of Duty with a squirt gun, hiding behind couches and everything.
1839920	1841920	Ron Workman is a communist.
1841920	1845960	Ron, out of curiosity, Ron, have you ever heard of a Japanese game calledÖ
1845960	1846960	No.
1846960	1847960	Alright, just donít.
1847960	1849960	Donít ever look it up because youíll hate it.
1849960	1852960	Is it a rhythm game?
1852960	1859840	Yeah, itís based on this old Japanese style of dancing that was done by girls wearing
1859840	1863440	these big tall boots and they wave their hands around like to Eurobeat music.
1863440	1864440	Itís something to behold.
1864440	1865440	Iíll give you that.
1865440	1870440	Mine is one of those things, like, I would never let someone see me in public playing
1870440	1874640	DDR unless I was completely just wasted drunk off my ass because when I see people playing
1874640	1879720	DDR, Iím just like, ìYou look ridiculous!î Iím one of those guys thatís just like,
1879720	1880720	ìLook at that guy playing DDR!
1880720	1885200	He looks like an idiot!î Iíve always been like that and Guitar Heroís kind of the same
1885200	1886200	thing.
1886200	1890520	I hate toÖ Iím not condemning it, but I canít see myself playing it with a plastic
1890520	1891520	toy dancing around.
1891520	1893960	But in the privacy of your own home when no oneís looking?
1893960	1894960	Maybe I would.
1894960	1897440	Itís kind of like the ìween awayî where if you play it at home, people are going to
1897440	1901280	see it and people like Ron wonít want to play it, but the others will be interested
1901280	1902280	and theyíll pick it up.
1902280	1906280	I donít see the 360 sales doing well with it, but six months from now I donít see it
1906280	1907280	doing well.
1907280	1908280	And when they come out with a wireless guitar?
1908280	1909280	I love guitar.
1909280	1910280	Yeah.
1910280	1915400	And that actually looks pretty tough, so maybe Iím going to get one when I do that.
1915400	1916400	All right.
1916400	1917400	All right.
1917400	1919360	Weíre going to go around now and Iím going to ask everybody what they believe the best
1919360	1922760	game of 2006 was and the worst game we hear at Orange Launch Radio.
1922760	1925200	Weíre tallying it up, so weíll start with the best game.
1925200	1927880	Franz, what do you think the best game was of 2006?
1927880	1930200	Cliche, but Twilight Princess.
1930200	1935760	Why Twilight Princess over everything else?
1935760	1936760	Waiting for Shearís answer now.
1936760	1939760	Because Iíll admit that itís not quite as good as I hoped.
1939760	1945600	I think the wolf part downplays it a little bit, but if you forget about it, itís a Zelda
1945600	1950480	game and if you just pretend it was a completely new game and you compare it to any other game
1950480	1952080	from 2006, the game plays solid.
1952080	1954000	Thereís not a lot to complain about.
1954000	1958320	Itís a high nine, so I think it wonít have a top, but not even Gears.
1958320	1961080	Itís a game thatís topping a lot of peopleís list.
1961080	1965080	Shear, what did you think the best game of 2006 was?
1965080	1966720	Final Fantasy XII, hands down.
1966720	1967720	Final Fantasy XII.
1967720	1969320	That game just ripped me apart.
1969320	1970320	I got it.
1970320	1972760	I played it for like 20 hours in the first three days.
1972760	1973920	I just played it nonstop.
1973920	1974920	I love that game.
1974920	1975920	Itís so good.
1975920	1980720	Have you always been a Final Fantasy series whore or was XII kind of your enabler?
1980720	1983520	I played Final Fantasy VII, loved it.
1983520	1986160	Played Final Fantasy VIII, fuck you guys, loved it.
1986160	1991320	Played Final Fantasy IX, hated FFX and hated everything else after FFX, so FFXII was kind
1991320	1992320	of the last.
1992320	1993320	Which would be FFXI.
1993320	1996320	Yeah, FFXI and then the spinoff games.
1996320	1997320	Oh, yeah.
1997320	1998320	True.
1998320	1999320	Theyíre just a bit of some crap.
1999320	2001040	No, I deleted those from my brain.
2001040	2003480	FFXII doesnít exist to me.
2003480	2008760	Yeah, so I really liked FFXII, Rebirth of the Series, really interesting characters,
2008760	2011280	amazing graphics and I just loved it so much.
2011280	2012280	Itís so good.
2012280	2015560	All right, dare I ask, Ron Workman, best game of 2006.
2015560	2020640	Youíre going to make fun of me, but Burger King, Sneak King.
2020640	2023080	Iím totally fucking around.
2023080	2027600	Come on, what was the best value of 2006, at least notó
2027600	2030120	Yeah, the Burger King games were three bucks, four bucks, whatever.
2030120	2036640	Yeah, gee, I could pay $4.99 or I could pay $5 for a new Rally-X. Let me think.
2036640	2038680	Hey, youíre really going to lay it to me.
2038680	2041600	I actually bought that shit, didnít I, when I was drunk.
2041600	2042600	I bought Rally-X.
2042600	2043600	So did I.
2043600	2044600	Letís not tell anyone.
2044600	2052560	I remember it when I was a kid, you know, playing with a big steering wheel and stuff.
2052560	2057200	Gears of War, I mean, I really liked Reba Pinana and Call of Duty 3, I think, was underrated,
2057200	2060840	but I have to say, I mean, Gears of War, hands down, itís a no-brainer for me, you know,
2060840	2065440	and Iím not into the fantasy games like Zelda or Final Fantasy, nothing against them, but
2065440	2066440	I justó
2066440	2068440	Youíre a gun fan.
2068440	2072800	Yeah, itís an amazing game to me, you know.
2072800	2078640	I like, you know, Cliffy B, they did some really innovative stuff, in my opinion, and
2078640	2083000	thereís things that were like, you play those first person shooters and stuff, and youíre
2083000	2088600	always looking for the next gimmick, but this wasnít the same thing, itís, I donít know,
2088600	2092560	it was immersive, like you got into it, and it was a different thing.
2092560	2096480	And Call of Duty 3 is the same way for me, itís really immersive for me.
2096480	2100220	I like how they changed it, like a lot of people donít like it because they were used
2100220	2104440	to the Unreal Tournament 100 mile an hour multiplayer with Call of Duty 2, where it
2104440	2107160	wasnít like a war game at all.
2107160	2110680	And lately Iíve been reallyóI didnít get 3 until a few weeks ago, but Iíve been really
2110680	2114160	impressed and, you know, me and Suma even discussed it, weíre like, we donít understand
2114160	2115160	why people donít like it.
2115160	2119280	Itís a really underrated game, but, you know, Gears of War, hands down, itís better than
2119280	2120280	it, so.
2120280	2124840	But probably Call of Duty 3 definitely on your top 10 for the year, at least.
2124840	2129440	Yeah, it was a real, like, late bloomer for me that I just wasnít expecting to be that
2129440	2133600	good because I heard so much bad feedback, you know, and I liked Call of Duty 2 because
2133600	2137200	Iím a big multiplayer fan, so.
2137200	2138200	My worst game of the year?
2138200	2139200	Novadrome.
2139200	2140200	Yeah, sure, why not?
2140200	2141200	Well, letís go into worst game of the year.
2141200	2142200	Ron, start us off.
2142200	2143200	Novadrome.
2143200	2144200	Novadrome.
2144200	2147560	He smacked it in the face for making that game.
2147560	2152080	They owe me 20 bucks for playing the demo, thatís how I view it, and Iím still pissed.
2152080	2155920	What was soóI mean, because, I donít know if itís just me, but they really hyped up
2155920	2161680	these end-of-year Xbox Live independent title releases that they were going to do, and I
2161680	2164560	wasnít really impressed with any of them, even Assault Heroes.
2164560	2169280	I wasnít really feelingóI was kind of like, Iíd almost rather play Rally-X.
2169280	2170880	Ten bucks, you know?
2170880	2175000	Yeah, Rally-X, the deciding thing was like, I was like, ìAh, Iíll play this one as a
2175000	2178760	kid, whatever, you know, five bucks, no big deal, but $10 on some of those games is a
2178760	2182040	little tough for me to swallow, and itís not that Iím tight with money about it, you
2182040	2183040	know?
2183040	2187960	But if I could play the demo, like, the Assault Heroes demo was pretty long, and thatís fine,
2187960	2188960	you know?
2188960	2192400	Like, Iíve bought Pac-Man and Frogger and Galaga and all those, but, contra.
2192400	2196120	Out of curiosity, how do you feel about the Wii downloadable stuff?
2196120	2198120	Would you pay $10 for an N64 game?
2198120	2203500	The last time I played a Wii was six months ago at a private show, and Iíve not played
2203500	2208920	one since, and Iím not even seeing the virtual console stuffóor, yeah, is that what itís
2208920	2209920	called?
2209920	2210920	Virtual console?
2210920	2211920	Yeah.
2211920	2212920	Yeah, not even seeing it.
2212920	2217560	But I do know about the pricing, and it disappoints me that Nintendo is doing that.
2217560	2222880	You know, I guess they can, because their fans are, you know, I really hate to get into
2222880	2224760	this, but Nintendo fanboys are pussies.
2224760	2228040	You guys should stand up and fight.
2228040	2234120	You should fight Nintendo to make better shit.
2234120	2237120	Nintendoís never going to make better shit, and theyíre going to come out with subpar
2237120	2239120	consoles and charge too much.
2239120	2242920	All right, Nintendo fans, you can address those cards and letters to Graybush, Care
2242920	2243920	of Destruction.
2243920	2247440	Non-Graybush workmen, yeah, exactly, but no, itís one of those things where, like, Xbox
2247440	2252600	Live is genius, and the reason itís genius is because people are absolute assholes to
2252600	2254840	Microsoft and theyíre not scared to be.
2254840	2258680	If theyíre pissed, they will flame them to hell and back, or write it on their blogs
2258680	2259680	or whatever.
2259680	2262920	Do you think no one wants to stand up to Reggie because heíd kick your ass?
2262920	2267880	Nintendo is this golden cow that nobody wants to, you know, theyíre on a pedestal, and
2267880	2270920	come on, Nintendo canít do anything wrong, blah, blah, blah, thereís some shit games
2270920	2271920	out there on the Wii.
2271920	2276440	Nobody bitches about them like they would if it was a bad Xbox game, you know, like
2276440	2277440	Xbox Live.
2277440	2282560	I donít know, Loki kind of went off on Cars the other week.
2282560	2285200	And all the Ubisoft games suck ass.
2285200	2289120	I have officially boycotted them for all their Wii launch titles.
2289120	2291080	What about Rayman?
2291080	2294680	Rayman was just average, and that was their best game of the entire lineup.
2294680	2299160	The show Rayman was my favorite.
2299160	2303720	I really wish that people would say, ìHey, Nintendo, we donít want a system that only
2303720	2307360	has the graphic power of an Xbox, an original Xbox.
2307360	2308960	We want to be able to play DVDs.
2308960	2314600	We want to have online multiplayer out of the box and launch games to back it up.
2314600	2321040	We donít want to pay $10 for a Mario Brother game weíve bought 20 times before, you know?
2321040	2326600	Itís dicking their fans over, if you add all that stuff into what you spend to have
2326600	2331240	games and play the Wii and to track down 4 controllers for the damn thing, itís not
2331240	2333360	any cheaper than buying a 360.î
2333360	2335920	Alright, weíve got to keep it moving.
2335920	2336920	Thatís alright, sorry.
2336920	2337920	No, thatís ok.
2337920	2338920	Let me get over my fanboy.
2338920	2341760	You just sound like you could go all day long on this Nintendo thing.
2341760	2347540	Iíll leave him to read the Destructoid.com blog to see your further love and adoration
2347540	2349040	for all things Nintendo.
2349040	2352080	Iíd like for your rights as a gamer.
2352080	2356800	Shear, what would you say is the worst game of 2006?
2356800	2357800	Red Steel.
2357800	2362880	Because you asked me what the biggest disappointment of 2006 was, and I said Father Princess, but
2362880	2365680	Red Steel was the kind of game that I never really had expectations for.
2365680	2368880	I saw it, I was like, ìThat could be cool, but itís probably not going to be.î And
2368880	2371360	I played it and it wasnít, it was just so bad.
2371360	2375400	And even the multiplayer, walking around, dinosaurs shooting me in the face, Iím like,
2375400	2378920	ìWhat the hell is this?î The controls were terrible, the guns were terrible.
2378920	2381120	I just hated it with a passion.
2381120	2384040	I remember the buzz about that a long time ago before it came out, it was like, ìThis
2384040	2386680	is going to be really cool, you can swing your sword around and blah, blah, blah.î
2386680	2387680	Oh man, the multiplayer.
2387680	2392240	It was like, ìThis is garbage.î You all worry about that whole, theyíre going to
2392240	2395400	call you and you put the Wiimote to your ear and everybodyís like, ìThatís such a cool
2395400	2396400	idea.î Yeah, exactly.
2396400	2397400	Itís so retarded.
2397400	2401640	And at the time, they were saying you were going to be able to use a microphone that
2401640	2405720	was in the Wiimote, because I played it a long time ago, which never came about.
2405720	2409800	But my friend got it and I was like, ìDude, letís go play it.î And weíre playing it.
2409800	2414080	And the multiplayer, as soon as you figure out how to use your stupid sword, like you
2414080	2416680	brought it up to people and you just like, theyíre dazed and you just shoot them in
2416680	2421040	the face like 45 times and itís so annoying because you canít kill anybody unless youíre
2421040	2422040	using your stupid sword.
2422040	2426440	And the multiplayer is cheap and the stupid ring thing is retarded.
2426440	2428840	Was the game just rushed, you think?
2428840	2430520	No, I just think it was atrocious.
2430520	2432520	I think they donít know what theyíre doing.
2432520	2436040	They said they were working on it for months, fixing it, so I think it just didnít pull
2436040	2437040	it off.
2437040	2439160	I think they were just like, ìYeah, fuck this game, this is terrible.î I donít know
2439160	2440160	what they did.
2440160	2442720	You know, you would think that they might be able to sell copies of Red Steel 2 if they
2442720	2446400	just said, ìOh, Red Steel 1 was rushed, sorry, weíll make it better next time.î But you
2446400	2447400	know, it kind ofÖ
2447400	2448400	But it wasnít.
2448400	2449400	It wasnít.
2449400	2450400	It was just bad.
2450400	2451400	All right.
2451400	2453360	Franz, what would you think was the worst game of 2006?
2453360	2454760	This oneís pretty easy.
2454760	2459920	Armado, itís a game on the PSP and all it is is youíre an armadillo rolling around
2459920	2462640	the game and all you do is hit one button to jump at the right time.
2462640	2463640	Thatís the entire 40-dollar game.
2463640	2464640	I shit you not.
2464640	2465640	And itís not even a homebrew.
2465640	2466640	Itís an actual game.
2466640	2469640	It was like a small companyís first game, so I hate to knock it because, you knowÖ
2469640	2470640	Youíre making shit up to get out of this easy.
2470640	2471640	Nobody knows what youíre talking about.
2471640	2472640	Nobody knows what youíre talking about.
2472640	2473640	One of us down there at big names, Franz, is like, ìArmado.
2473640	2474640	I hate it.î
2474640	2475640	It caught my eye in game shows and I laughed my ass off at it.
2475640	2479120	You know, funny enough, thatís not, out of all the ones weíve heard, thatís not the
2479120	2480120	first game.
2480120	2491760	Somebody mentioned itís the worst game that none of us had heard of, so there you go.
2491760	2497080	Itíll be interesting to hear the rest.
2497080	2501840	So is this why the PSP keeps getting flack for not having the same game power as the
2501840	2502840	PSP?
2502840	2503840	PSPís terrible.
2503840	2504840	That shit is only disappointed about six.
2504840	2505840	I just donít think they have enough good games.
2505840	2506840	They have good games.
2506840	2507840	They just donít have enough.
2507840	2508840	I hate the PSP.
2508840	2509840	I had it written for me.
2509840	2510840	I hate it.
2510840	2511840	I want to throw it at them.
2511840	2514440	It cost me so much money, though.
2514440	2516080	But Luminous, Metal Gear.
2516080	2517080	Yeah, 360.
2517080	2518080	Yeah.
2518080	2519080	Keep going.
2519080	2520080	All right.
2520080	2521080	All right.
2521080	2523840	Anyway, weíve got to wrap it up here.
2523840	2528480	What do you guys have planned for 2007 over at Destructoid, if you can say?

2596240	2607600	Big thanks to those guys over there at Destructoid.com for coming on the program and especially
2607600	2612580	to Franz because originally him and I were on another show called Cross Platform together
2612580	2615020	earlier this year which is why I remembered him and originally it was just going to be
2615020	2618320	him that came on, but he was like, ìDude, you want to get some more people on?î So
2618320	2623040	he got some of his co-bloggers over there at Destructoid.com to come on as well and
2623040	2625080	that was a fun little interview.
2625080	2629480	I definitely need to check out more of their own podcast over there because Iím sure itís
2629480	2635040	a riot, so check that out over at Destructoid.com, one of my favorite gaming blogs, by the way,
2635040	2636040	and I mean that.
2636040	2638400	Thatís the best side address ever.
2638400	2643280	I like their little robot icon that they work into everything, so pretty cool.
2643280	2644280	All right.
2644280	2646280	Whoís coming on next, DarkSakura?
2646280	2649840	I have Godfrey from Gamertag Radio.
2649840	2657960	All right, Iím joined here now by Godfrey from Gamertag Radio.
2657960	2658960	Godfrey, you there?
2658960	2659960	Yeah, Iím here.
2659960	2660960	Whatís going on, man?
2660960	2661960	Hey, not a lot.
2661960	2663680	How you doing?
2663680	2664680	Everything good, man.
2664680	2665680	Big fan of the show, man.
2665680	2666680	Big fan.
2666680	2667680	Thank you.
2667680	2668680	Appreciate it.
2668680	2669680	Weíre big fans of you guys as well.
2669680	2670680	You guys have come a long way.
2670680	2674320	Youíre what, going to be two years podcasting pretty soon?
2674320	2678200	Yeah, itís going to be two years now in February.
2678200	2688280	Iíve been also recording before that around 2000, 2001, like a Phantasy Star Online radio
2688280	2689280	show.
2689280	2693360	At that time, on the Dreamcast, it was like a big comedian.
2693360	2701040	But I also used to help out these guys, gamingnoise.com, Chip and Zach, and I know all games, too.
2701040	2704760	They used to do a radio show, too, at that time, 2001.
2704760	2705760	Yeah, they were around.
2705760	2707880	Just out of curiosity, Phantasy Star Universe was out this year.
2707880	2709680	Did you kind of get on board with that?
2709680	2714600	Yeah, I was playing a lot for a good month.
2714600	2719440	But then, I donít know, I wasnít feeling it like how it used to be with the Dreamcast.
2719440	2722440	It seemed more strict.
2722440	2725240	Last time on the Dreamcast, it was more open.
2725240	2727840	I donít know, it felt kind of different.
2727840	2731840	I donít know if it was because of the next-gen consoles or, you know, I donít know.
2731840	2735440	I just wasnít too thrilled with online gaming on that.
2735440	2736680	Thatís all right.
2736680	2739360	Now, I want to ask you about this, too.
2739360	2743920	You guys have had a lot of Microsoft celebrities on your program this year, havenít you?
2743920	2745160	Yes, a lot.
2745160	2750760	Recently, we had an Xbox community, and we had a lot of people from the Xbox community,
2750760	2753680	a lot of podcasters in there.
2753680	2759720	And also, people from Microsoft came to the show to help us out and just thank the community
2759720	2762680	that theyíve been helping out throughout the years.
2762680	2768240	Major Nelson was there, Trixie, Peter Moore was also part of it, Aaron Greenberg.
2768240	2771720	And itís been a great year for us, man.
2771720	2777240	Weíve been busting our butts big time this year, and I want to thank everybody from Microsoft
2777240	2778240	for helping us out.
2778240	2781160	Yeah, it sounds like itís really paid off for you guys, so congratulations.
2781160	2783320	Those are some big names to have on your show.
2783320	2784320	Yeah, man.
2784320	2788200	Yeah, I mean, we could do it, anybody could do it, you know, everybodyís just got to
2788200	2789200	be dedicated, man.
2789200	2790200	Absolutely.
2790200	2794920	I want to ask you this as well, because your show is mostly centered around Xbox, but do
2794920	2798840	you play Nintendo Wii, PlayStation, do you play the other consoles too?
2798840	2807280	Yeah, as a matter of fact, I was camping out, man, trying to get the Nintendo Wii during
2807280	2808280	launch day.
2808280	2810840	I was in line for like at least 12 hours, man.
2810840	2811840	Wow.
2811840	2812840	Iíve been playing that here and there.
2812840	2820680	Iíve only been playing Zelda for the Wii, and I downloaded a couple of virtual console
2820680	2821680	games too.
2821680	2824680	Thatís why Iíve been spending most of my timeÖ
2824680	2831040	Iím just waiting to see if I can have more games in 2007, waiting for WarioWare, I played
2831040	2835440	that too, and the Nintendo party, they were here in Miami a couple months ago before launch.
2835440	2836440	Awesome.
2836440	2837440	I like that game a lot.
2837440	2840200	Yeah, I got to play WarioWare at E3, it was one of the few games that didnít have a mile
2840200	2841200	long line.
2841200	2842200	It was pretty fun.
2842200	2843200	Yeah, itís different, man.
2843200	2848200	Itís cool to get a group of people to play together in there, you know?
2848200	2853040	Itís different than the other games in the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox.
2853040	2856720	I think that gameís going to show us just why the Wii is a party console just as much
2856720	2857720	as the GameCube.
2857720	2860520	Yup, I think so too, man.
2860520	2866160	Well, Godfrey, we got to get to the game weíre playing here, which is the Year 06 in review,
2866160	2871000	and weíve started off with 15 boxes, but now we only have six left, so please, pick
2871000	2872720	a number one through six.
2872720	2877800	All right, so tell them whatís going on for this year, man.
2877800	2881880	Well, you got to tell me whatís going on in 2006, you got to pick one of these boxes
2881880	2882880	one through six.
2882880	2889240	Let me pick number, let me pick number one, that sounds pretty cool.
2889240	2892080	Number one, letís open it up.
2892080	2899120	All right, we want to know your opinion, what did you think was the best handheld game in
2899120	2900120	2006?
2900120	2901120	Ooh, handheld.
2901120	2905400	Ooh, thatís a good one, man.
2905400	2908680	Iíve been playing a lot of BS.
2908680	2915680	I have to say, in my opinion, Animal Crossing was really cool, Iíve been playing that a
2915680	2916680	lot.
2916680	2920440	Let me see, what else have I been playing, Luminous, also from the PSP, I know that came
2920440	2922040	out, what was it last year that came out, though, right?
2922040	2923840	But you did have Luminous 2 this year.
2923840	2929360	No, Iíve been playing it, but Iíve been playing a lot of Luminous from the Xbox 360.
2929360	2935560	So out of all those games youíve played, which one would you say was the best?
2935560	2940360	Which version, from the Luminous or from the PSP or the Xbox?
2940360	2943560	For any handheld system, which game would you say was the best?
2943560	2944560	Animal Crossing, man.
2944560	2948640	I had a lot of fun with Animal Crossing this year, Iíve been playing that a lot, a lot.
2948640	2952880	I mean, yeah, thatís the only game Iíve been playing a lot on the handheld this year.
2952880	2957480	Itís pretty addicting, I mean, you can go online with it and go visit other peopleís
2957480	2961400	towns, and it seems like it doesnít really end, ever, that game.
2961400	2966640	Exactly, and not only that, itís based on real time, too, so itís like I wake up and
2966640	2970320	Iíll be like, ìAll right, itís daytime over here,î and I could go online and I might
2970320	2974800	go to somebody else that the time is ahead in their town, letís say for somebody from
2974800	2981680	maybe Europe or Japan, and their town is based on their time, so itís like, ìOh, man, itís
2981680	2986200	nighttime over here, let me check it out,î and itís cool, because I know Animal Crossing
2986200	2987640	has a great community, too.
2987640	2994720	I donít know if youíve been checking out a couple of websites called animalcrossingcommunity.com,
2994720	2999920	where people can exchange their friend codes and exchange items and help each other out
2999920	3000920	and stuff.
3000920	3001920	I donít know, I find that really cool, man.
3001920	3008160	Itís different from a lot of other games handheld, so, you know, thatís what it is.
3008160	3015720	I know that game was in the GameCube, but one thing that was missing was the online
3015720	3020720	park, which, when it came out on the DS, I know a lot of people enjoyed that a lot, too.
3020720	3025840	Now, Iím sure Animal Crossing on the Wii will be inevitable, so, you know, you will
3025840	3029040	give me your friend code at that point, let me come chop down your trees, right?
3029040	3034800	Oh, for sure, man, yeah, but get ready, because Iím going to go to your town and do the same.
3034800	3036800	All right, sounds good.
3036800	3040000	We want to get your opinion on a news story as well, of course, weíre going down the
3040000	3043880	highlights of 2006, and Iíve got to say, youíve got a good one here.
3043880	3050200	Actually, you have an audio Daily Double here for the news story, so letís go to the audio.
3050200	3053480	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Harai.
3053480	3056160	Ridge Racer.
3056160	3062560	The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change, and the consumers are ready.
3062560	3067280	Genji 2 is an Ashen game, which is based on Japanese history.
3067280	3069620	Ridge Racer.
3069620	3075800	Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles,
3075800	3078480	which actually took place in ancient Japan.
3078480	3082120	So hereís this giant enemy crab.
3082120	3084640	Ridge Racer.
3084640	3088760	And you attack its weak point for massive damage.
3088760	3090840	Itís Ridge Racer.
3090840	3092840	Ridge Racer.
3092840	3106960	E3 will retail for $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, itís Ridge
3106960	3107960	Racer.
3107960	3108960	Ridge Racer.
3108960	3116600	Yes, thatís right, itís Sonyís infamous press conference from E3, where they got taunted
3116600	3118480	incessantly afterwards.
3118480	3122200	Godfrey, were you at E3 this year, watching it online?
3122200	3130400	As a matter of fact, that day during the press conference, Iím also part of the Xbox MVPs
3130400	3131400	from Microsoft.
3131400	3138400	Itís a lot of community members that got invited to E3, and we were there, you know,
3138400	3142840	having a couple meetings, talking about the Xbox, and then all of us got together and
3142840	3146280	wanted to see the press conference of Sony, because thatís when they were announcing
3146280	3154160	the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii during E3, so we were watching it, and I donít know,
3154160	3157360	it was very, very boring, like the presentation.
3157360	3161800	I think Nintendo did a really good job this year presenting the Wii and also Microsoft
3161800	3167600	with the Xbox 360, but I donít know, Sony was just like straight up boring, and I donít
3167600	3171840	know why it was the hype or the system, you know, like everybody was like, ìOh my God,
3171840	3179480	the graphics are going to be amazing,î and look, ever since E3, that happened, look now
3179480	3182880	like theyíve been getting a lot of bad press ever since, you know?
3182880	3185620	What do you think caused all that bad press?
3185620	3186840	Was it the price tag?
3186840	3189920	Was it the giant enemy crabs line, the Ridge Racer?
3189920	3192480	What caused all the bad press, do you think?
3192480	3197920	Oh man, I think everything combined, but I think the most was the price, man.
3197920	3202560	You know it is, a lot of people have been busting their butts, man, just to try to get
3202560	3208000	a game because now games are like $60, you know, $59.99, itís like people got to be
3208000	3212840	really picky on what theyíre going to purchase, and itís like people are lining up, getting
3212840	3219520	the PlayStation 3, and once they got it, it felt like it was rushed, you know?
3219520	3225320	I think Sony was under pressure big time because of Xbox, especially here in the United States.
3225320	3231520	I know in Japan, theyíre probably concentrating more on the competition with Nintendo, but
3231520	3238240	I donít know, it just, it feels rushed, and itís like the online part, itís not like
3238240	3240320	how it is with the 360.
3240320	3245280	I think people are having a better time connecting online with the places in portable than the
3245280	3251840	places in 3, and now with exclusives, itís like Assassinís Creed is coming out of 360,
3251840	3258400	like slowly, a lot of Sony fans are going to go and purchase the other consoles because
3258400	3259400	they donít have no choice.
3259400	3265320	They canít find a console in stores or, you know, thereís not many great games, so right
3265320	3271000	now only Resistance is an okay title for the Sony, so I donít know, man.
3271000	3276000	What do you think Sony can do to give themselves some good press in 2007, to really turn their
3276000	3278960	car around and get back on track?
3278960	3282280	I think itís the games, man, itís all about the software, man.
3282280	3287960	If they have the right games, and itís fun, I think that slowly is going to pick up more
3287960	3293480	people to get the places in 3, and also they should lower the price, man, $600 is a little
3293480	3295780	bit too much.
3295780	3302200	I think they were very gassed up that they sold a lot of units with the places in 2,
3302200	3306740	and they thought they were going to do the same thing with places in 3, no matter what
3306740	3311440	price it is, and look, now theyíre struggling, you know, itís like, I know theyíre going
3311440	3315480	to learn from that, man, so hopefully next year theyíre going to lower down the price,
3315480	3316480	man.
3316480	3320960	Theyíve got a lot riding, too, on Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy 13, kind of the
3320960	3324600	only big, big, big exclusives I can think of that are left, soÖ
3324600	3330720	As a matter of fact, I think places in 2, this year, in the Christmas season, they had
3330720	3336240	a lot of great games, man, a lot like Bully, the new Final Fantasy, theyíve been getting
3336240	3343120	a lot of great games, man, I think thatís what they need, man, they need companies,
3343120	3347760	you know, to create great games for the system, you know, and especially first-party-wise,
3347760	3353760	they donít have no great games right now on the system, so Nintendo and Microsoft are
3353760	3356920	coming strong with the first-party titles, you know.
3356920	3361120	Well, speaking of great games, thatís a good segue into what we want to ask you next, Godfrey,
3361120	3366360	weíre tallying it up all night long, what do you believe was the best video game of
3366360	3367360	2006?
3367360	3370240	Well, to me, man, I think it was Gears of War, man.
3370240	3371240	Gears of War.
3371240	3372240	Gears of War.
3372240	3373240	Yeah, Gears of War.
3373240	3381360	I mean, I know itís not a perfect game, but I think, like, graphic-wise, the sound, everything
3381360	3384120	put together was, like, amazing in that game, man.
3384120	3388400	The only thing that was really lacking was the story, but itís okay, I think Iíve been
3388400	3392960	having a blast, like, playing a lot with my friends and with my brother, weíve been doing
3392960	3394320	co-op and all that.
3394320	3401200	I think thatís, to me, like, the best game for 2006, Gears of War, and I think the sleeper
3401200	3404360	hit also was Viva Pinata, in my opinion, man.
3404360	3405360	Really?
3405360	3407760	Yeah, I think so.
3407760	3414200	I think Microsoft did a horrible job promoting the game, I think they were promoting too
3414200	3420400	much on Gears of War, and the tension just went away when Viva came out, you know?
3420400	3422640	So I think that game is really fun.
3422640	3428040	Personally, I see this game more for older crowd, because itís a little bit too confusing
3428040	3429040	for kids.
3429040	3435460	Godfrey, I would have never have guessed that someone whoís been doing this radio program
3435460	3441920	about the Xbox and the hip-hop community combined was secretly an Animal Crossing and Viva Pinata
3441920	3442920	fan.
3442920	3443920	Yeah, man.
3443920	3444920	I donít know about that, you know?
3444920	3445920	It doesnít think at all.
3445920	3446920	Itís great.
3446920	3447920	You know, itís great.
3447920	3448920	You know what it is, man?
3448920	3449920	Itís innovation, man.
3449920	3454480	People, companies just gotta come out, like, different, man, like, thatís the same thing
3454480	3455480	with music.
3455480	3459920	When everybodyís doing the same thing, it gets boring, you know, and thatís why I love
3459920	3465680	Nintendo, what theyíre doing with the Wii control, and itís just different, itís like
3465680	3467640	having a different experience while playing the game.
3467640	3471720	Itís like, you feel like, when youíre playing Zelda on the Wii, you think youíre in the
3471720	3472720	game, you know?
3472720	3474200	Itís totally different, man, soÖ
3474200	3475200	All right.
3475200	3480200	Well, now, speaking of something totally different, what do you believe was the worst game of
3480200	3481760	2006, Godfrey?
3481760	3483760	Wow, worst game!
3483760	3494920	Man, I have two choices, either Superman from the Xbox 360 or this game too, Totonball.
3494920	3499920	They was actually free for the Xbox Live arcade with the, you could control with the Xbox
3499920	3500920	Live Vision camera.
3500920	3501920	Yeah.
3501920	3504200	It was a really bad game.
3504200	3508120	I was playing it, and I just got tired playing it, like, my arms was, like, falling asleep
3508120	3509120	trying toÖ
3509120	3511720	I donít know if you got the chance to play that game or not.
3511720	3515640	I, unfortunately, did, and was bored of it in about five minutes.
3515640	3520120	I mean, I unlocked one achievement, so after I unlocked that achievement, I was like, ìOh,
3520120	3521120	right.î
3521120	3523320	There was one achievement I got really easy by playing the pinball game.
3523320	3526240	Like, there was another game in it that was, like, a pinball game, and I played it for,
3526240	3528280	like, two minutes, and I got an achievement somehow.
3528280	3529280	Oh, okay.
3529280	3533920	I seen you download it, you get an achievement, I guess.
3533920	3536760	You actually played this piece of crap.
3536760	3537760	Five points.
3537760	3538760	Yeah, man.
3538760	3539760	I donít know.
3539760	3540760	I wouldnít waste my time on that, man.
3540760	3543160	Thereís a lot of great games on Xbox Live Arcade.
3543160	3544480	Donít even bother with that one.
3544480	3547760	Iím putting you down for Totonball, because you ran it a lot longer on that one than you
3547760	3548760	did Superman.
3548760	3549760	Yeah.
3549760	3550760	All right, all right.
3550760	3551760	Cool, cool.
3551760	3556480	Out of curiosity, do you think the Xbox camera, because, you know, Totonball is kind of, like,
3556480	3558400	the camera game for Xbox 360.
3558400	3562520	Does the Xbox 360 camera, can it serve a better purpose than this?
3562520	3564600	Yeah, I think so, man.
3564600	3571200	I mean, I know during the holidays, one of my good friends, he used to be a, heís a
3571200	3575560	podcaster, too, but now he works with Microsoft, Chris Paladino.
3575560	3581740	His family, he moved to Seattle ever since he got a job at Microsoft, and during Christmas,
3581740	3585120	they got together with his family in the East Coast and him in the West Coast, and they
3585120	3590640	used the Xbox Live Vision camera to talk, and during Christmas, they went opening presents
3590640	3594960	and all that, so it felt like they were, like, together, you know?
3594960	3595960	Thatís nice.
3595960	3601320	I think by that, or playing games like Uno online, I think itís a great purpose to play
3601320	3602320	that, man.
3602320	3603320	All right.
3603320	3605680	Well, Godfrey, thanks so much for being here on the show today.
3605680	3608680	What do you guys have planned over there at GamerTag Radio for 2007?
3608680	3614600	Yeah, right now, weíre hopefully, in 2007, weíre going to launch, weíre going to still
3614600	3621120	continue with the audio shows, podcasts, and also, weíre working on a video podcast, weíre
3621120	3627480	working on that, and one of my staff members, Pink Sage, is also working on a project, like
3627480	3630560	a GamerTag Radio magazine.
3630560	3633200	Right now, weíre keeping it on hold, but itís going to be really cool, man.
3633200	3637440	Itís going to be something different, and weíre still going to be concentrating on
3637440	3641520	the community, because thereís a lot of websites thatís not getting known, and weíre trying
3641520	3647280	to support them so they can get their name out there.
3647280	3648520	We can have a lot of interviews.
3648520	3650880	Are you guys planning to go to CES this year?
3650880	3655080	I donít think any of us are signed up for CES this year, but weíre kind of holding
3655080	3659440	out to see, hopefully, about the new E3, and probably that GamePro Expo, and some various
3659440	3661400	anime conventions weíll be going to this year.
3661400	3664800	Just donít know about CES, because thereís usually not a lot of game content.
3664800	3665800	Okay.
3665800	3672320	Yeah, well, weíre planning to go to CES, and also got invited to a community event
3672320	3679560	in Canada by EA, the NBA Street home court thatís coming out for the Xbox 360 also.
3679560	3683560	Well, weíll just wait for your video, and Iíll download it to my video iPod, and itíll
3683560	3684560	be like I was there.
3684560	3685560	All right, there you go.
3685560	3686560	All right.
3686560	3691560	I want to thank you, and everybody, support Orange Lodge, man.
3691560	3692560	Iím a big fan.
3692560	3693560	Thank you.
3693560	3694560	Thatís what we got to do.
3694560	3698160	We got to get together all the podcasters, and I continue to work.
3698160	3701920	We do a lot of talking about that, independent podcasts supporting each other, and thatís
3701920	3705960	what we wanted to do tonight with our New Yearís special is really bring everybody
3705960	3706960	together.
3706960	3710960	So really, we want to thank you for being on board and coming on with this, especially
3710960	3716400	you guys have had a lot of success, so weíre very happy you havenít forgotten your independent
3716400	3717400	roots.
3717400	3719840	Tell everybody real quick how they can check out your show, if they want to.
3719840	3726520	Yeah, they could go on gamertagradio.com, and we have all the shows in there, and also
3726520	3729040	on iTunes, they could check it out and subscribe to the show.
3729040	3730040	All right.
3730040	3732040	Go there right now, everyone, gamertagradio.com.
3732040	3733160	Godfrey, thanks so much.
3733160	3735360	Happy holidays, and good luck in 2007, all right?
3735360	3736360	Happy holidays, man.
3736360	3737360	All right.
3737360	3738360	Take care, man.
3738360	3744400	Thanks a lot.
3744400	3748260	Big thanks to Godfrey from Gamertag Radio for coming on, and heís been doing his show
3748260	3749260	a long time.
3749260	3754560	He did not realize that before he was podcasting, he actually did another type of recordable
3754560	3760240	show, so thatís pretty cool, and I love the fact that heís an Animal Crossing fan, Viva
3760240	3761240	Pinata fan.
3761240	3762240	Thatís cute.
3762240	3765520	You two should be the best of friends, Dark Soccer, because you never shut up about Animal
3765520	3766640	Crossing on this program.
3766640	3768960	I did when I got bored with it.
3768960	3770240	Just imagine when it comes out for the Wii.
3770240	3771240	I know.
3771240	3774800	Thatís what we were saying there at the end there is that I cannot wait to go to his village
3774800	3778680	on the Wii and chop down all his trees and send his villagers some nasty e-mails.
3778680	3780720	Thatíll be tons of fun, wonít it?
3780720	3786360	Anyway, we still have some boxes left to open here in studio, so weíre going to go around
3786360	3791480	and have some folks open the remaining boxes, Dark Soccer and Loki, but also we brought
3791480	3796400	in some other guests live, some folks from Orange Lounge Radio, past and present, so
3796400	3798600	say hello first to Rice Princess.
3798600	3800100	How you doing, maíam?
3800100	3801100	Pretty good.
3801100	3802100	How about you?
3802100	3803100	Good.
3803100	3805360	Now, you used to come on Orange Lounge Radio way back in the day.
3805360	3808960	You came on the Wednesday show with me, and we had a lot of fun there, but what have you
3808960	3809960	been up to in 2006?
3809960	3812200	We havenít heard a lot of you in 2006.
3812200	3815840	A good majority of it has been World of Warcraft.
3815840	3816840	World of Warcraft?
3816840	3817840	Yep.
3817840	3818840	Are you looking forward to Burning Crusade?
3818840	3819840	Hell yeah.
3819840	3820840	All right.
3820840	3821840	Yep.
3821840	3822840	All right.
3822840	3823840	You ready to open up a box?
3823840	3824840	Sure.
3824840	3825840	All right.
3825840	3827560	Thereís five boxes left on the table, Rice Princess, one through five.
3827560	3829440	Which one of those do you want to open?
3829440	3830440	Box number three, Rob.
3830440	3831440	All right.
3831440	3832440	Letís open it up.
3832440	3836120	All right.
3836120	3842480	The gaming category we want to know your opinion on, game I liked this year that no one else
3842480	3843760	seemed to.
3843760	3847200	The game you liked this year that no one else seemed to.
3847200	3850640	Oh, thatís a hard one.
3850640	3855100	I didnít do a lot of console gaming this year, and everything that I did play on consoles
3855100	3859280	was pretty well received, so I donít know if I have an answer for that.
3859280	3860280	Uh-oh.
3860280	3861280	Yeah.
3861280	3863280	What do you think?
3863280	3865480	Um, well, uh, Elibits.
3865480	3867200	There you go.
3867200	3873400	Well, Elibits did get some bad reviews from some gaming press out there, so I guess thatíll
3873400	3874400	work.
3874400	3875400	I have no idea.
3875400	3877400	That just kind of came out of my head.
3877400	3878400	That works.
3878400	3879400	Weíll take it.
3879400	3880400	Okay.
3880400	3881400	I have never even played it.
3881400	3886360	I just watched it last night for the first time.
3886360	3890360	Itís the one that came to most recent memory, so there you go.
3890360	3894320	This is why she hasnít been on the network in a year and a half, ladies and gentlemen.
3894320	3895320	Cry, cry, cry.
3895320	3896320	Just kidding.
3896320	3897320	We still love you.
3897320	3898320	Yay.
3898320	3900320	Well, what were some games that you liked that everyone liked then?
3900320	3903320	Kingdom Hearts 2 came out this past year, right?
3903320	3904320	That was one.
3904320	3905560	I actually did play that.
3905560	3909880	Final Fantasy XII was really good.
3909880	3911280	Twilight Princess was great.
3911280	3914680	I havenít actually played it, but Iíve seen it played, and it looks awesome.
3914680	3918680	Yeah, just the bigger ones that everyone knows about.
3918680	3922160	Hereís a news story we want to get your opinion on, and that would beóand oh, this is a good
3922160	3924320	one for youóare you a big fan of the Xbox?
3924320	3925320	No.
3925320	3927920	Then Iím sure youíre going to love this one.
3927920	3932520	What we want to know your opinion on is what do you think of the Halo 3 madness going on
3932520	3933520	out there?
3933520	3937840	Halo 3 was announced at E3 this year, and itís been building and building.
3937840	3943540	Thereís been all this crazy press coverage leading into a release next year of the game.
3943540	3948240	How important is Halo 3 to the Xbox 360 in 2007?
3948240	3951520	Iím pretty sure itís going to be one of the pillars.
3951520	3957280	Iím sure itís going to be one of the big sellers, but me personally, I donít care.
3957280	3958280	I donít give a shit.
3958280	3959280	Whatever.
3959280	3960640	Why donít you care about Halo 3?
3960640	3962280	Because I didnít care about the first two.
3962280	3963280	I didnít play them.
3963280	3964280	I donít care.
3964280	3966040	Are you just not a first-person shooter fan?
3966040	3967040	Not really, no.
3967040	3968040	All right.
3968040	3969040	Sorry to hear it.
3969040	3970040	Yeah.
3970040	3971040	Okay.
3971040	3976280	Well, Rice Princess, what in your opinion was the best video game of 2006?
3976280	3978280	Something that came out in 2006?
3978280	3979280	Yeah.
3979280	3980280	So you canít do World of Warcraft.
3980280	3981280	Sorry.
3981280	3982280	Yeah.
3982280	3983280	Dang it.
3983280	3984280	Iím going to say Kingdom Hearts 2.
3984280	3985280	I really enjoyed it.
3985280	3986280	Itís a good game.
3986280	3987280	Kingdom Hearts is fun.
3987280	3988280	Yeah.
3988280	3989280	It is.
3989280	3990280	It really is.
3990280	3991280	All right.
3991280	3992280	Is it just because of the story, or is it the action?
3992280	3993280	Because some people say this gameís too easy.
3993280	3994280	You just hit X, X, X all the time.
3994280	3995280	Yeah.
3995280	3999240	The actionís pretty much the same as the first one, so itís not like they really did
3999240	4001880	a lot with that, but the story was really, really good.
4001880	4002880	All right.
4002880	4003880	Yeah.
4003880	4006720	Whatís the best game of 2006, Rice Princess?
4006720	4008520	Chirp, chirp.
4008520	4010720	I donít really know.
4010720	4013120	I canít make an informed decision on that.
4013120	4016440	Iím sure thereís a lot of bad games.
4016440	4019360	There wasnít anything you played that you were just like, ìWhat a crap.î
4019360	4020360	No, not really.
4020360	4021360	Really?
4021360	4022360	I donít play crap.
4022360	4023360	Okay?
4023360	4024360	Thatís why.
4024360	4026400	Then just say Sonic or Bomberman.
4026400	4028400	Sonic or Bomberman, or both.
4028400	4029400	All right.
4029400	4032240	Then weíre not putting anything down for you, and you suck.
4032240	4034880	You need to resolve to play more games in 2007.
4034880	4035880	Oh, my God.
4035880	4036880	Thatís a great resolution.
4036880	4037880	Iíll do that.
4037880	4038880	All right.
4038880	4039880	I promise.
4039880	4040880	All right.
4040880	4042760	Letís move over to Extafur is joining us as well from our program.
4042760	4043760	How you doing, Extafur?
4043760	4044760	Good, and you?
4044760	4045760	Good.
4045760	4049880	Now, youíve become more of a gamer in 2006 than you were in 2005, huh?
4049880	4050880	Yeah.
4050880	4051880	And why would you say that?
4051880	4054780	Because of your Wii.
4054780	4055780	Pretty much.
4055780	4056780	My Wii has that effect on people, apparently.
4056780	4057780	Yeah.
4057780	4060240	I play your Wii all the time nightly, really.
4060240	4063080	And donít help those rumors that are going around, Extafur.
4063080	4064080	Iíve watched him do it, too.
4064080	4065080	It was great.
4065080	4066080	And by your Wii, I mean penis.
4066080	4067080	Did I get that?
4067080	4069680	Did I not?
4069680	4072200	Like I said, please, those rumors are bad enough as it is.
4072200	4073200	Oh.
4073200	4074200	All right.
4074200	4077400	Well, so do you feel like maybe youíre pretty well informed to make some decisions on the
4077400	4078400	best and worst game of 2006?
4078400	4079400	I think so.
4079400	4080400	All right.
4080400	4082080	What would you say was the best game of 2006, Extafur?
4082080	4084880	Best game of 2006, Excite Truck.
4084880	4085880	Wow.
4085880	4086880	Really?
4086880	4087880	Why?
4087880	4090080	Because I unlocked everything in it.
4090080	4094920	I played it for hours and hours, and I must like it because I played it for hours and
4094920	4095920	hours.
4095920	4101520	So amongst Burnout, Test Drive Unlimited, you choose Excite Truck.
4101520	4102520	Yes.
4102520	4104160	Why is this game so damn appealing?
4104160	4106560	Because you know, a lot of hardcore gamers are passing on Excite Truck.
4106560	4107560	I know.
4107560	4108560	Because they say itís too junky.
4108560	4111440	They need to play it more, is what I say.
4111440	4115300	Because thereís a learning curve to it, but once you get past the learning curve, itís
4115300	4116300	so much fun.
4116300	4123240	And I donít understand, you know, itís not the graphics, itís not the, you know, trophies
4123240	4126560	or achievements or anything like that, itís the actual gameplay.
4126560	4131920	I really, really like the gameplay, and I like the challenges and everything.
4131920	4135280	And on top of that are all the achievements and all the other things that you get.
4135280	4148520	Alright, well everyone here at Orange Longs Radio is welcome to their opinion, even if
4148520	4149520	theyíre wrong.
4149520	4150520	Which you are in this case.
4150520	4151520	No, Iím just kidding.
4151520	4152520	No, Excite Truckís a lot of fun.
4152520	4153520	I think it was underrated.
4153520	4154520	I think, I really do think it was underrated.
4154520	4155520	Yeah.
4155520	4156520	I think when it came to racing games this year, I think I like Burnout a little more
4156520	4157520	because thereís more fire than there is in Excite Truck.
4157520	4158520	Yeah.
4158520	4159520	No, no Excite Truck was better.
4159520	4160520	Alright.
4160520	4161520	Well, what was the worst game of 2006 in your opinion?
4161520	4162520	Well, I actually have to jump on the bandwagon and say Sonic the Hedgehog, because I actually
4162520	4163520	played that.
4163520	4167680	Iíve only been really getting into video games heavily within the last two months,
4167680	4171320	I would say, like in the last year or whatever, you know.
4171320	4176420	So like, and that was one of the games I played, and that was so god-awful, I just could not
4176420	4177420	play it.
4177420	4179240	I just, it was just god-damn awful.
4179240	4181480	But you played the old Sonics, right?
4181480	4182480	Yeah.
4182480	4183480	And you loved those games.
4183480	4186440	My favorite, one of my favorite games ever is Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
4186440	4188760	So where did Sega fuck up?
4188760	4193680	They just, they went, see, and I liked Sonic Adventure when it came out for the Dreamcast.
4193680	4197520	I really liked that game, so I think they can do it right when they do 3D.
4197520	4202400	But I just, I think their execution and the control and everything was just, it was too
4202400	4204920	much this time.
4204920	4208360	And they could execute it right, because I did like that other game.
4208360	4211320	Alright, well thereís four boxes left on the table.
4211320	4213760	Tell me which box do you want to open.
4213760	4215320	Box number two.
4215320	4218960	Like, shit.
4218960	4220120	Thatís what number two is.
4220120	4226840	Alright, letís open up box number two for extrovert.
4226840	4232760	What did you think was the best retro revival of 2006, meaning the best game that made it
4232760	4237840	like a comeback in 2006?
4237840	4240440	I donít have an answer for that, because I donít.
4240440	4242400	You better come up with one.
4242400	4250320	I think that the best, Iím going to say Bomberman Act Zero.
4250320	4251640	Why Bomberman Act Zero?
4251640	4256960	Because it was so goddamn stylish, and they just raped all the gamers on that one.
4256960	4259120	I just have to, I have to give it to them.
4259120	4261080	Wasnít it Konami that made that game?
4261080	4263600	Yeah, I think so, Hudsonís Branch or whatever, yeah.
4263600	4266560	Good job, what I have to say.
4266560	4268000	Best revival ever.
4268000	4271880	Iím having, Iím getting an orgasm in my pants just thinking about it.
4271880	4276400	Well, speaking of which, we want to know your opinion on news stories.
4276400	4279760	The Nintendo console, because youíve been playing a lot of the Wii, and one big news
4279760	4283720	story this year was that originally that system was going to be called the Nintendo Revolution,
4283720	4284720	right?
4284720	4288840	But they changed their mind somewhere along the line, and they decided that the name of
4288840	4294480	the console was going to be the Nintendo Wii, and folks just, you know, they went nuts.
4294480	4298200	They said, like, you know, they made every Wii joke under the sun, and still do to this
4298200	4299200	day.
4299200	4301480	What was your reaction when you heard that Nintendoís new console was going to be called
4301480	4302480	the Wii?
4302480	4309640	I think it was a lot like everyone elseís, like, huh, like, what, I donít understand
4309640	4315480	how you can go from revolution to Wii, but then it really was a good business decision
4315480	4321760	on their part, I think, because people, itís different, you know, and youíll remember
4321760	4322760	Wii.
4322760	4326880	I mean, you will, itís just one fucking syllable, you know, itís like, I said fucking right
4326880	4333680	there, but anyhow, itís one fucking syllable, and thereís also, you know, thereís just,
4333680	4338560	everybody knows what it is, you know, it was easier to market, I think, when, if it was
4338560	4344360	the Nintendo Revolution, it would, I think, be going back, you know, going backwards,
4344360	4349520	because youíre used to having video game consoles with those kinds of names, you know.
4349520	4352080	And penis jokes, have you been making a lot of Wii jokes this year?
4352080	4356360	Actually, yes, I have, Iíve been Can you tell us one of your best Wii jokes?
4356360	4365160	No, no I canít, actually, I can say, though, that when I was waiting in line for the Wii,
4365160	4371080	you pretty much heard every, every Wii joke you could possibly hear, and that was kind
4371080	4373640	of amusing, because everybody was just making them all night.
4373640	4376360	I think a lot of them originated from our part of the line.
4376360	4378400	I wasnít there, I was sleeping.
4378400	4379400	Yeah.
4379400	4382240	I played with my Wii and then went to sleep.
4382240	4384580	We woke you up.
4384580	4385580	It did.
4385580	4391280	Anyway, letís thank you guys to Xtifer and Rice Princess, thank you guys for coming on,
4391280	4393280	we appreciate it.
4393280	4397580	Alright, thereís three boxes left on the table, and hey, three hosts for the show,
4397580	4400920	so Dark Sakura, one, two, or three?
4400920	4403200	Uh, well, um, two.
4403200	4405760	Two, you want two, alright, letís, oh, youíll let this one.
4405760	4406760	Itís an even number.
4406760	4411280	Alright, here we go, box number two.
4411280	4413800	Dark Sakura, the best party game of 2006.
4413800	4418120	Oh, fuck, I donít play party games.
4418120	4421320	Everybody in the studio is getting one they canít do.
4421320	4422320	I changed my box.
4422320	4423320	No, you canít change the box.
4423320	4424320	I returned this one for store credit.
4424320	4425320	Nope, canít do that.
4425320	4429680	Wasnít there a game that people would get together at your house and play a lot this
4429680	4430680	year?
4430680	4431680	No.
4431680	4432680	Madden.
4432680	4433680	Fuck.
4433680	4434680	Madden.
4434680	4435680	No.
4435680	4441440	Um, okay, Iím gonna have to go though, Iím gonna go universal with party and say Animal
4441440	4442440	Crossing.
4442440	4443440	Oh, okay.
4443440	4449160	Because I got so many dirty letters from my friends, and so many people, I had someone
4449160	4454160	going around in my village calling everyone a wanker, and then I had someone else say
4454160	4457160	shit face, and it was great.
4457160	4458160	Thatís so mature.
4458160	4459160	Thatís awesome.
4459160	4464760	And, you know, putting, you know, putting dirty t-shirts in my shop, and it was pretty
4464760	4465760	fun.
4465760	4466760	Alright.
4466760	4470500	Now, the news story we want to know your opinion on, and that would be, remember when Bully,
4470500	4473160	the game Bully on the Playstation 2 was first released?
4473160	4477720	Which controversy when they discovered that your character, a boy, can kiss another boy
4477720	4478720	in the game?
4478720	4481720	What did you think about that whole controversy?
4481720	4486840	I thought that I really didnít care, because it was kind of, I was like, thatís cool,
4486840	4488240	but these people are stupid.
4488240	4489240	What people?
4489240	4490840	The people who were all up in arms over it.
4490840	4492240	Like Tack Jomsom?
4492240	4494240	Oh, God.
4494240	4499580	Thatís somebody who just needs to get butt raped with a corn cob.
4499580	4503520	Do they need to do more of this type of content in games?
4503520	4504520	Yes.
4504520	4507120	We need more hot gay action.
4507120	4509840	Do you think gay gaming is fairly represented in games today?
4509840	4514320	Well, not really, because I think a lot of itís more sensationalized, you know, because
4514320	4519520	like, oh, if we put two hot chicks, you know, kissing, then itíll attract the straight
4519520	4520520	white male quotient.
4520520	4525660	No, they just need to have, like, actual just, they need what they need to, and I think this
4525660	4529900	was in any media, they need to remove the sensational aspect from it and just make it
4529900	4531480	like any other thing.
4531480	4532480	You know?
4532480	4533480	Itís normal.
4533480	4539080	There are a vast number of people in the world who have normal, you know, I donít think
4539080	4542920	that there should be any distinction made between, oh, straight people are normal, oh,
4542920	4547800	gay people, you know, that big thing, it should just be no big deal.
4547800	4551820	So yeah, so you think that they donít need to go out of their way to incorporate gay
4551820	4552820	content in the games either?
4552820	4557120	I think it should just be, you know, if this, if youíve written this character and this
4557120	4561760	character, you know, sets off your gaydar, have them fuck a guy, I donít know.
4561760	4565720	Then everything should be like The Sims, where itís just played however the hell you want.
4565720	4572520	The Sims is the best, the best, I think, way theyíve done it, because itís either or,
4572520	4577640	you know, and thereís tons of gay couples out there who adopt children, who, you know,
4577640	4581840	get themselves artificially inseminated, who adopt, you know, I think that it should just
4581840	4587040	be no big deal, it should just be, because I think, and this is how I feel about a lot
4587040	4591120	of stuff, is that whenever you make a big deal about something, thereís gonna be other
4591120	4595300	people who make a big deal about it, who treat it as some sort of pet topic, when really
4595300	4598520	it should just be average, it should just be accepted.
4598520	4599520	All right.
4599520	4600520	So thatís what I think.
4600520	4601520	All right.
4601520	4602520	Thanks for your opinion.
4602520	4606320	Now, we also want to know, what did you think was the best game of 2006, Dark Sakura?
4606320	4607320	Cookie Mama.
4607320	4610080	Why did I think you were gonna say that?
4610080	4614360	Out of all the games, out of the Kingdom Hearts II, the Final Fantasy XII, the Oblivion, the
4614360	4616280	Gears of War, you pick Cookie Mama.
4616280	4620960	Because Iím still playing it, and Iíve been playing it, and I havenít put it down.
4620960	4623280	Whatís so great, whatís so freaking great about Cookie Mama?
4623280	4625880	Pulling the head off a shrimp.
4625880	4628200	Chopping up meat.
4628200	4630960	Are you excited about Cookie Mama Wii thatís coming out next year?
4630960	4633560	Yeah, yeah, I want my Cookie Mama Wii.
4633560	4637080	Worst game of 2006, Dark Sakura?
4637080	4641040	I mean, Sonic, honestly.
4641040	4642040	I canít help it.
4642040	4645480	It was a complete and utter shite.
4645480	4649400	I just was like, ìOh my God, itís a bad Sonic game.î
4649400	4653800	And you have been a Sega fangirl for the longest time, so I ask you what I asked X to for.
4653800	4654800	Where did Sega go wrong?
4654800	4662240	First of all, putting it on the PS3, and second of all, really crap control.
4662240	4671360	I mean, overall, it looked like it had a lot of potential, but thereís so much glitchy
4671360	4673360	bullshit in it.
4673360	4678120	I think if they tightened up the control, or maybe even, I donít know if they did,
4678120	4684600	but used the engine from Sonic Adventure, even with the glitches in that game, you could
4684600	4686560	still play through it, and it was a good game.
4686560	4691000	They need to really have that tightness of control that Sonic Adventure had.
4691000	4692680	Alright, well thanks for your opinion.
4692680	4694400	We know you always like to interject it.
4694400	4695720	My opinion is awesome.
4695720	4697680	Loki, thereís two boxes left.
4697680	4698680	One or two.
4698680	4699760	Donít be reading off the screen.
4699760	4700760	One or two.
4700760	4701760	I canít see the screen.
4701760	4702760	Good.
4702760	4703760	Two.
4703760	4708600	Iím so glad you picked this one.
4708600	4711920	Best sports title in 2006.
4711920	4714600	Best sports title in 2006.
4714600	4717160	Actually, I would think...
4717160	4722920	Not Tecmo Bowl, they didnít release Tecmo, well I guess Title Legends, no, Title Legends
4722920	4725920	was last year.
4725920	4731880	I would say actually, probably Wii Sports, since thatís really, you know, kind of everyone
4731880	4732880	liked that.
4732880	4737080	It was universally liked, and where itís like, you know, any EA sports game is pretty
4737080	4741640	much, you know, youíre either a fan of it or, so Wii Sports was kind of that game that
4741640	4744720	got people to cross over, even people that were like, ìI hate Madden, I donít want
4744720	4747960	to play Madden,î which, you know, can be me sometimes.
4747960	4748960	I loved Wii Sports.
4748960	4749960	It was awesome.
4749960	4754000	Yeah, Wii Sports was fun, and Madden, Iím sure, on the Wii is probably pretty fun.
4754000	4757560	I know a lot of people were getting into that, that donít normally like football.
4757560	4762760	I donít follow sports, so, you know, to play a sports game is just kind of, eh.
4762760	4767320	I donít know what, you know, who anyone is, or what the teamís, you know, strengths and
4767320	4768800	weaknesses are.
4768800	4772280	You kind of have to be a fan of the sport to be able to play the game well, you know,
4772280	4776160	because you have to know the strengths of each player and stuff, and since I donít
4776160	4780920	do that, nor, you know, I wouldnít be able to be any good at it.
4780920	4783360	I have to ask you about this one, because, yeah, I think Wii Sports would have been my
4783360	4786680	answer to this, too, but if I went outside that and wanted to pick an actual sports title,
4786680	4790080	I think I actually would have picked Rockstarís Table Tennis.
4790080	4791200	Did you like that game?
4791200	4797040	I didnít really play that game that much, and, no, Table Tennis, you know, I still have
4797040	4799000	trouble thinking that thatís a sport.
4799000	4800000	Itís fun.
4800000	4801920	It was way better than, like, Topspin 2 was.
4801920	4803680	That was, like, one of the worst games I played this year.
4803680	4804680	I donít know.
4804680	4808760	I would say if I was going to pick a sports game, I would, you know, thatís even last
4808760	4809760	year, though.
4809760	4813240	I was going to say Project Gotham Racing 3, because racing is a sport.
4813240	4814240	True.
4814240	4815240	All right, all right.
4815240	4820960	And so, if I were to say this year, then maybe best sports game, you know, Burnoutís not
4820960	4821960	a sport.
4821960	4822960	That doesnít really count.
4822960	4825440	All right, and that leaves you with this news topic.
4825440	4827880	Iím so excited you got this one.
4827880	4831560	One thing that Sony announced at their press conference that suddenly kind of seemed to
4831560	4835200	disappear throughout the year was the Eye of Judgment.
4835200	4840840	Now, I remember Loki went off on the Eye of Judgment not too long ago on this program,
4840840	4843440	but Loki, what are your thoughts on the Eye of Judgment?
4843440	4848440	Does the PlayStation 3 need this, or does it need to just vaporize like it seems to
4848440	4849440	have?
4849440	4853920	I donít know if itís vaporizing, but some other things that they were talking about
4853920	4859080	releasing, like the GPS system for the PSP and the camera for the PSP, those are supposed
4859080	4862480	to be coming out fall of this year.
4862480	4863480	Where are they?
4863480	4864480	Oh!
4864480	4865480	They didnít come out.
4865480	4871880	Well, I guess the GPS came out in Japan, but the more that you think about it, those peripherals
4871880	4872880	are just kind of lame.
4872880	4877680	And the only thing about the Eye of Judgment, I mean, I guess it could be cool if it was
4877680	4881960	just the eye toy and they were just kind of souping up the eye toy, that would be a little
4881960	4886400	bit better to recognize your face and stuff like that and to be able to tell different
4886400	4887720	things based on that.
4887720	4892720	That would be cool, but this whole giant setup where they had like, almost looked like some
4892720	4898160	sort of desk lamp stand with the camera pointing down at the paper, I mean, I canít see anyone
4898160	4904160	actually setting that up to play a card game, which the game on PlayStation 3 itself does
4904160	4907720	nothing other than kind of visualize, you know, card stuff.
4907720	4912040	If it was like holographic or something, that would be pretty cool, but no, itís not.
4912040	4916400	So why would you pay for a $600 console to play this really crappy card game that you
4916400	4921360	have to set up this really elaborate set up to play, and to be honest, they also want
4921360	4926520	you to buy these cards too, which, you know, all anyone has to do is scan it into their
4926520	4930280	computer and then you can print it out on a piece of paper and play it the exact same
4930280	4931280	way.
4931280	4934640	So the whole idea is just utterly retarded.
4934640	4939080	Alright, what would you say was the best video game in all of 2006, Logie?
4939080	4944080	Thatís tough, because thereís a lot of games out there and, you know, Iíd say my favorite
4944080	4951080	game of 2006, the one Iíve been playing the most of, well, Iíd have to say, you know,
4951080	4956360	oddly enough, itís a tie between like Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and Liberty City
4956360	4957360	Stories.
4957360	4961400	Even though Liberty City Stories came out last year, the multiplayer is fun on those.
4961400	4965440	Then Saints Row would have to be up there too, because Saints Row, I think right now
4965440	4968000	Saints Row was the most fun for me on the 360.
4968000	4969440	So which one of those would you put on the list?
4969440	4970440	Saints Row.
4970440	4972960	Saints Row.
4972960	4973960	And why?
4973960	4976680	Because you love gun games.
4976680	4981680	I love sandbox games and theyíre just really fun and Crackdown I think is going to be really
4981680	4987160	fun next year, but, you know, I donít know, weíll see if Microsoft is able to capture
4987160	4988960	the same kind of feel as that.
4988960	4992520	Really it doesnít matter next year anyways, because once Grand Theft Auto IV comes out,
4992520	4997040	thereís no trumping it unless they really fuck it up, which is possible because they
4997040	5001480	fucked up the multiplayer every single Grand Theft Auto PSP version thatís come out, yet
5001480	5006160	we still seem to play it and kind of just, you know, accept the really glitchiness of
5006160	5010720	the game and, I donít know, itíll be fun multiplayer I think.
5010720	5012960	Alright, and the worst game of 2006.
5012960	5015920	Oh man, the worst game of 2006.
5015920	5019120	You know, everyoneís singing Sonic the Hedgehog and I think theyíre saying that because itís
5019120	5023440	fresh in their mind, but actually Sonic isnít that bad of a game, I mean, just the controls
5023440	5028760	are a little bit crappy, but I wouldnít say itís the worst game of 2006, if anything
5028760	5034000	I would go with some of the Ubisoft titles for the Wii that are really awful like, you
5034000	5042800	know, Monster 4x4 World Circuit, but Iíd say overall the worst game of 2006, itís
5042800	5049040	gotta be Bomberman because Bomberman, it was just a boring game and it wasnít really fun
5049040	5056080	at all and, I donít know, itís just bad, but you know, if I were to, you know, peg
5056080	5059240	a company as the worst company of 2006, itíd be Ubisoft.
5059240	5064640	Alright, I mean, granted, I love Ghost Recon, it was fun to cheat in that game and thank
5064640	5068360	God that they put cheat codes in the game that you can still get achievement points
5068360	5075700	for, so props for them for that, but Iím sorry, you know, all their Wii launch titles,
5075700	5078440	with the exception of Rayman being average suck balls.
5078440	5084680	Alright, well, thereís one box left, so I guess I get to open it, so here I go.
5084680	5093000	Hey, look, I got the million dollars, whoo, alright, no, I got a best use of music in
5093000	5098960	a game and hands down Elite Beat Agents, hello, like, that was one of my favorite, definitely
5098960	5101400	my top three of the whole year was that game.
5101400	5105000	That game is incredible and, you know, some people criticize it for the song list, but
5105000	5108280	I thought it was actually kind of fun and it made you appreciate maybe songs that you
5108280	5113520	had forgot about and the covers were, you know, well done and yes, even Ashley Simpsonís
5113520	5115400	song was actually kind of fun in the game.
5115400	5118640	The gameís got a great sense of humor, itís one of the most hilarious games Iíve played
5118640	5121640	and it keeps you coming back because itís got a lot of difficulty, you know, levels
5121640	5122880	in it and multiplayer.
5122880	5127080	The game is incredible and horribly, horribly underrated, I think more people should be
5127080	5131600	checking out Elite Beat Agents, absolutely the best use of music in a game, in 2006.
5131600	5137320	And then the news topic I have would be the horse armor expansion for Oblivion.
5137320	5138320	That was retarded.
5138320	5140960	And this would be what, the topic or the horse armor?
5140960	5141960	No, the horse armor.
5141960	5145720	Because at Oblivion, when I think of games that have great add-ons, Oblivion is like
5145720	5146720	at the top of the list.
5146720	5150320	You know, this horse armor was one little bump in the road of otherwise what was an
5150320	5153200	awesome expandable game was Oblivion.
5153200	5155440	Probably the best expansions of the year was Oblivion.
5155440	5159400	But this horse armor, man, when it first came out a lot of people were like 250 points for
5159400	5161420	some frigginí horse armor, what the F?
5161420	5162720	You know, and I kind of agree.
5162720	5167560	And this just goes along in general with some of these downloads that companies have put
5167560	5168560	up this year.
5168560	5172040	Itís gonna help us think about as well EAís pay to cheat system.
5172040	5173040	Thatís dumb.
5173040	5174040	Yeah.
5174040	5177680	Itís dumb especially when you have games, like I said, like Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter,
5177680	5180440	that the cheats are in there and you still get achievement points.
5180440	5184920	I mean, grand, you canít use them online, but itís easy achievement points.
5184920	5185920	I mean, thatís awesome.
5185920	5187840	Youíre an achievement point whore.
5187840	5191520	What kind of expansions would you like to see available on Marketplace in 2007?
5191520	5195880	Saints Row would be, you know, what theyíre doing with like Crackdown, for example, theyíre
5195880	5198880	gonna have actually portions of the city that theyíre gonna add later on.
5198880	5199880	Thatís cool.
5199880	5204200	And theyíve built the game with that kind of expansions in mind.
5204200	5207880	Saints Row would have been cool with some, you know, theyíre doing like maps and stuff.
5207880	5210740	And actually theyíve had some pretty good stuff.
5210740	5214960	Maybe more missions would be kind of cool or like a whole other section of the game.
5214960	5220100	I definitely think in, as far as Xbox 360 goes, you know, they need more RPGs.
5220100	5221600	They need their Blue Dragon this year.
5221600	5223760	They need some of those other titles to come out.
5223760	5225580	And I love side quests, man.
5225580	5229000	Those downloadable side quests was an awesome idea for Oblivion and really, really adds
5229000	5230880	just hundreds and hundreds of hours to that game.
5230880	5232920	So itís great.
5232920	5234540	That is all 15 boxes.
5234540	5236200	We made it all the way through.
5236200	5237200	Can you believe it?
5237200	5238200	Oh, my best and worst.
5238200	5239640	I gotta say mine because we gotta tally it up, huh?
5239640	5240640	You know what?
5240640	5246280	I wish Bethesda would make a game like Oblivion but set in modern day so I can have the guns
5246280	5249800	and be able to exert my, you know, power over the Woodlands.
5249800	5252360	Do you think thereíll be an Elder Scrolls V though?
5252360	5254240	Of course thereís gonna be an Elder Scrolls V.
5254240	5256960	I heard it here first.
5256960	5258480	Of course thereís gonna be.
5258480	5259480	All right.
5259480	5261200	Well, my favorite game of the year, itís really close.
5261200	5266760	I really want to say Oblivion but, you know, and itís a great game, donít get me wrong.
5266760	5270000	It would definitely be my number two pick but I would say the best game of the year.
5270000	5271820	It has to be Zelda, Twilight Princess.
5271820	5276400	I mean, it really took everything that was about, even though the game was developed
5276400	5280580	originally for the GameCube, yeah, whatever, it really does show what the Wii is capable
5280580	5284860	of doing to what you always thought about the games that you played.
5284860	5285860	You know what I mean?
5285860	5290160	Itís a prime example of that and I think it really is kind of everything the Wii stands
5290160	5293240	for and itís absolutely the greatest game to have come out this year and well worth
5293240	5294240	the wait.
5294240	5299000	I mean, tons of playability and great puzzles and, you know, just fun.
5299000	5303640	Itís a different playing experience, something you would never have had before, I think.
5303640	5305060	Itís something new.
5305060	5308840	So thatís why it stands out in my mind as the best game of 2006.
5308840	5309840	Worst game of 2006?
5309840	5310840	Iím with Loki.
5310840	5311840	Itís Bomberman X0.
5311840	5312840	Absolutely.
5312840	5316400	I mean, how can you fuck up a franchise like Bomberman, okay?
5316400	5321820	Fucking up Sonic, I can see that but fucking up Bomberman, my God, I think Bomberman would
5321820	5326400	have been so much better if they just had compacted it to 50 megs and made it an Xbox
5326400	5327400	Live title.
5327400	5330820	The biggest problem with Bomberman is that it was a piece of shit game that they put
5330820	5332400	out for $60.
5332400	5333400	I love you, Konami.
5333400	5338120	You did some great work this year but this game was somebody made a really bad decision
5338120	5339120	toÖ
5339120	5342800	Iím thinking what happened is that there were some deadlines that had to be met so
5342800	5346720	this game got out and itís just so obvious and the final product is not even funny.
5346720	5350720	The problem with some of these companies though is they forget that, you know, theyíre screwing
5350720	5354880	up like the simple stuff, the stuff thatís like essential, that would be the first thing
5354880	5355880	Iíd check.
5355880	5361720	Like, no save system, yeah, that might be important, you know, putting a save system.
5361720	5367060	Gee, I can do multiplayer on live but I canít do it in the same room when I could at E3.
5367060	5373320	That is the biggest sign to me that something got really fucked up in the development process.
5373320	5376800	And the whole thing with Bomberman is like, ìOh, wow, that looks kind of cool, you know,
5376800	5380880	when they show the videos and stuff.î It would have been cool as like an action game,
5380880	5384640	maybe like MDK or something like that, you know, where like letís just kind of branch
5384640	5388680	the franchise a little bit off differently and then you could have, you know, the party
5388680	5391120	mode or the classic mode or something like that.
5391120	5396640	Youíre charging people $60 for what essentially is an Xbox Live arcade game, thatís the only
5396640	5401720	good aspect of the game is playing it on live and because the gameís $60 and nobody has
5401720	5405360	it, so you canít even find people on live to play it with.
5405360	5408520	They just made like some huge mistakes with that game, they just ruined it, absolutely
5408520	5412200	ruined it and made it the worst game of 2006.
5412200	5416240	So now weíve got to tally it up, letís look, letís see, weíre going to tally up the votes.
5416240	5419160	Letís start with the worst game of 2006.
5419160	5425640	It looks like, tallying it up, we had two votes for Totem Ball, two votes for Bomberman
5425640	5431340	but it looks like between Black Wolf, Extrofer and Dark Sakura, Sonic the Hedgehog with three
5431340	5433680	votes is the worst game of 2006.
5433680	5440680	Sorry Sega, it wasnít that bad but you know what though, at least you get a second chance
5440680	5442960	with Sonic and the Secret Rings.
5442960	5448500	I agree they can redeem themselves but seriously, do a focus group or something with this game
5448500	5450060	next time.
5450060	5451360	Anybody could have told you the controls were fucked.
5451360	5454760	Well hereís the thing too, they made this game like Shadow the Hedgehog, Shadow the
5454760	5461440	Hedgehog got shitty ass reviews so the problem is you can only make a Sonic game so fast
5461440	5488040	before it becomes uncontrollable.
