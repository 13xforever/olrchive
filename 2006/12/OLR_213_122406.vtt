Sky

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
and the Lowkey

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, December 24th, 2006

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Some new channels make their debut on the Wii

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
A California lawmaker targets spyware and games

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
And is Katamari about to roll over Xbox Live Arcade?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
The plague has returned, but not nearly as bad. I'm prepared for it this time around.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Dark Sakura

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
How was your gaming week?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I did! I did do that!

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Super Pac-Man

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
It's too damn hard to play

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
I'd like to mention, just real quick, the story that I'm talking about, which I'll get into a little bit later

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I reported back on October 29th

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Just to give you an idea of how behind the times they are

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
He's stewing over there

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I smell an angst bunny

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Alright

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
We'll have to do the F-Fuse a little early this week

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Well, we're probably getting rid of one of our pinballs

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Oh, I'm sorry. Which one?

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Thinking about possibly the Guns N' Roses trying to get in Indiana Jones

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Are you that mad at Axl Rose for canceling the little Sacramento thing?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
No, I don't care

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Axl Rose is an ass

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I don't care

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
But, um, Dan's been wanting an indie for a while

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
And that's pretty cool

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
When are you gonna get Pinbot?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I want one! Actually, we want Jackbot

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
I don't, you know, your fancy schmancy bootlegs or whatever

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
It's not a bootleg

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Jackbot is the modern pinball version

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Whatever, whatever

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
It's got the same tracks as Pinbot

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
And has the bonus segment from Bride of Pinbot

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Alright, whatever

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
So it's really cool. However, we do have friends who have a Pinbot

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
So I can just go over there and play it anytime I want

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
But does it do the thing where it goes, I am Pinbot?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yes

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Okay, good

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
It is a fully functional Pinbot

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
And that game is fucking hard

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
On the NES it was pretty hard, too

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Because on the NES it had the little aliens that would try to eat your ball

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
But the actual pinball machine is just difficult

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I see

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
But I have a special place in my heart for Pinbot

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Alright

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Anything else you've played this week?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Besides playing with fire?

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
I did play with fire because I lit candles on the winter solstice

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
They need to make fire the game

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Well, there's putting out fire the game

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
The brave firefighters

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Okay, alright

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
That's a year-end award I'd like to see

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Best use of fire in a game

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
I did

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Well, there's also Burning Rangers back in the day

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I played another game though

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
What's that?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I played that marine harpoon Sega game

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Because I was at Walmart and I was bored

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
So I played the harpoon game

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
And how was that?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Sucks

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Alright

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
You spend the first time you play it and after that it's like

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
This screen has burning

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Fix

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
How was my gaming week?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Okay

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I played a lot of crappy games, unfortunately

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
I played Cars on the Wii and it sucked ass

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
I bought it for Nellie

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
She said she could try it and then she agreed it did suck ass

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
Then I kind of went back on what I said about Ubisoft

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And I went and bought another Ubisoft game

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
And this only further proves that their games suck

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Because I went and bought Monster 4x4 World Circuit

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Despite the reviews, I said

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Oh, they're just probably complaining because the graphics look like GameCube graphics

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
And it's not like we've been able to trust any major gaming press review recently anyway

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Exactly

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
So, you know, I thought, hey, you know, what the hell

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
It sounds like it could be like Excite Truck

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
It's four players

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
That could be fun

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
No, it's not

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
It's a horrible game

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Very awful

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
First off, the graphics suck

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
The controls suck

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
The game is boring

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
The music sucks

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Every aspect about this game blows ass

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
And if I rented this game

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I would immediately take it back

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
And say, what the hell is this piece of shit that you gave me

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Because this is obviously not a real game

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
I've done that with a game before

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
But what game?

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
It was the WWF at the time, Thunder game

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
On Playstation

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
It was so bad that Dan and I took it back to Blockbuster

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
And had them trade it out

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
I seriously, I would urge anyone not to even consider this as an alternative to Excite Truck

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
This is not even close

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I mean

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Well most people don't like Excite Truck either

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
So they're just like, you know what, no racing on the Wii for me

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Well

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Are you going to pick up Need for Speed Carbon?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Give it one more shot?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
No, I'm not picking up Need for Speed Carbon

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Need for Speed Carbon, I know what kind of a game it is

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
And so I know it would be pretty decent

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
It's just not the same type of a game as Excite Truck

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
But

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Monster 4x4 World Circuit, it's slow

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
But it comes with the Elite Steering Wheel peripheral

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Oh yeah, the Elite Steering Wheel peripheral

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
That's a piece of shit

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
I brought it into the studio today, okay, you know

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
I brought it to have Christopher try it out so he can give a review on the next show

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
But it is awful

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
It is a really bad game

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
And I'm sorry, but they just

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
So they had six or seven launch games

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Yeah, but they all sucked

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Ubisoft, you're just trying to capitalize on the lack of titles

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
You know, being out there

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
And hoping people will get to buy this stuff

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
And you know what, I'm sure a lot of people bought this stuff

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
And

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
I don't know, maybe their kids liked it and stuff, but

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
It's just, it's an awful game

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
And once you play, you know, like Excite Truck or something like that

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Or Need for Speed Carbon, you're just like, wow

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
What the hell is this shit

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
So

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
I urge you, do not buy this game

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Because you'll only be disappointed

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Do you think Ubisoft might be able to redeem themselves

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
With some of the later games that are coming out in 2007?

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
With, you know, 360, they've got some pretty big titles planned, right?

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Well, 360, they've got Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Which looks okay, but it looks exactly the same as

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 1

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
So, you know, Warfighter 2, great

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I mean, seriously, I

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
I challenge you to look at the screenshots and be able to tell the two games apart

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
You can't

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
They look exactly the same, so

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I don't know

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
But then again, people like stuff that's the same, so

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
It should be fine

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
And Rainbow Six Vegas, I heard, is pretty good

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
It's not my type of game

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
But

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I've seen some of the stuff that they're coming out for the Wii

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
For, you know, say, and

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
It's not anything new, let me put it that way

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
It's just ports of old shit

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
That they're tacking the controls on

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
And they really need to come out and create some new games

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
And I'm not talking about Red Steel 2

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
I'm talking about a brand new game

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Does Reggie need to come lay the smackdown?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
I think so

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I think

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I think they're just looking at numbers, you know

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
And Red Steel sold really well

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
It's just

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
It wasn't that good of a game

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
You know, people were looking for another GoldenEye

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And it was not GoldenEye

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Alright, was that it?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
That's it

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Alright, My Gaming Week, nothing really new to report for you guys

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I've been playing every extend extra

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
A little bit of Luminous 2 as well

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Still playing Burnout on Xbox

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And I'm getting very frustrated at how bad I suck at Burnout

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Because, like, you know, the achievements

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
You, for one of them you have to get, like, all

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Basically, the majority of the achievements are

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
You get all perfect ratings

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
In every difficulty level

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Right? Well, I'm one star shy

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
In the very first basic difficulty level

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
There's one freaking race I cannot get a gold medal in

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
And therefore I'm not able to get a perfect

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
And it's frustrating the hell out of me how badly I suck at Burnout

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
So, I cry a lot

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
But it does give me an opportunity to use custom soundtracks

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
And, like, listen to, you know

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
Like, what's kind of funny is usually I'll put in the soundtrack to Wangen

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And Midnight Maximum Tune

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
And I'll play Burnout to that

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
And it's kind of fun

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
So, yay for custom soundtracks

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
And, you know, I've been watching extra for play a lot of Excite Truck

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
By the way, I'd like to point out

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
He just finally got, just like as of a few moments ago

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Got the very last trophy

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
The Super Duper Rings trophy

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
And says that nothing else happens

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
You just get all the trophies, that's it

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
But he's been using the SD card that Jamie got him for

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Christmas to do all the custom soundtracks

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
He needs to get all the challenge modes finished

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
And I think that unlocks one other thing

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
That's minor

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
He's done every single possible thing he can do in race mode

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I mean, I don't know anybody, besides Nelly

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
That's probably as obsessed with this game as X for his

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Most people wrote off Excite Truck as kind of cheap

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Compared to Xbox 360 racers

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
You've been playing it at my house

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I have it at Dan House

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Interesting, it's so interesting because

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
This game kind of got a lot of critical

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Heat against it, but

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
It's really caught on with a lot of folks

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
That I've shown it to

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
They dig that, whereas

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
They don't get burnout

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Burnout's too intimidating for them

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Whereas me, I kind of prefer burnout, personally

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
To Excite Truck

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I like Excite Truck

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Yeah, I like Excite Truck

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
I think EA should take

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Burnout and make Burnout off-road

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
And kind of compete with Excite Truck

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Because it's kind of got the same

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Formula, almost

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
The way that you score points and stuff

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
For doing drifts

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Lack of online support being the biggest

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Well, that's just, I know

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
It's lame, that really is lame

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Lack of four player racing, stupid

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I mean, come on

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I really don't understand

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Nintendo and just saying, oh you know

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
All these other consoles have been online

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
For the last two generations

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
No, we're just not gonna

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
We just don't feel it right now

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
No, you're stupid

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
You're stupid, stupid, stupid

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
But you can't help but wonder if Excite Truck

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Is doing so well with the casual audience

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
How well, I mean

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
At least from our perspective, I don't know about you guys

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Out there, but all of our friends

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Who are only borderline into gaming

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Are loving Excite Truck

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
And I can't help but wonder how Mario Kart's gonna do

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Because you know that's inevitable

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
That we'll get a Mario Kart on the Wii eventually

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Probably not until 2008

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I hope it won't suck as bad as Double Dash

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Because Double Dash blew ass

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
But the DS one was pretty rad

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
And that's the most recent one, really

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Mario Kart 64

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
That's why it rocked

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
But the thing is though

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
It better have online play

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Because if it doesn't

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
That's a huge mistake

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
And I think that they really should

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Patch Excite Truck

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
So that it does have online play

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Because that's major

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Well they're not gonna patch it

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
That's just gonna be a feature in Excite Truck 2

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Fine, then it better come out quick

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Because I want another game

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
That if they did something sort of like

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
You know what Excite Truck reminds me of suddenly?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Is Cruis'n World

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Sort of

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I guess I can see that a little bit

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Yeah, I can see that a little bit

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
If they had the multiplayer be

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Sort of like how, what was that game?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Oh god, I can't remember

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
It's 2099

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
One of the racing games

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
It had the dial-in thing to where you could

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
You know what Excite Truck reminds me of?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
You mean

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Rush 2049

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Yes, thank you

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
You know what Excite Truck reminds me of?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
A woman

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
How?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Driving

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Woman driver of the game

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
No, I don't drive like that

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Yes you do

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
No I don't!

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
I drive very well, thank you

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
You know you reward yourself with stars

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
For the air you get in your vehicle

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Whenever you go over

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Hey, I've been driving since I was 16

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
And I got my first speeding ticket

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
So bite my ass in a non-literal way

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
So bite my ass in a non-literal way

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Anyway

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Anything else on Excite Truck?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Oh, it was still my gaming week

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Eh, who cares

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
DS Final Fantasy III

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Which I'm loving more and more

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Even though it's kind of hard

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
And I finally got the 4 star difficulty in Elite Beat Agents

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
God, I love that game

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I really do

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Thank you again for the year

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I'll tell you that much

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Before we get into the news

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Next week's show is also going to be pre-taped

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
We're pre-taped tonight, we're not live as we mentioned previously

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
But those of you guys on our audio RSS

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Also known as podcasting

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Have a chance to download the program

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
And so hello folks

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Next week is going to be the same deal

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
However, next week is going to be a special show

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Since we're anticipating there's not going to be a lot of news

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Due to the holiday season

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It's sort of a year-end special

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
And we're inviting a lot of our friends

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
As in other podcasters

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Other shows on OLR

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Guests that we've had previously on the program

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
And people in the industry

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
We're inviting a whole ton of them to come on

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
For little mini interviews

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
We're going to play a little game

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
And I'll give you more details next week

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
We're going to play a little game that will help everybody give an input

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
On what the best stuff was in 2006

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
And what we're going to look forward to in 2007

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
So by the way

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
If you are another podcaster

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
An industry type or something

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And you want to be on the program next week

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Drop me a line ASAP

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
rob at orangeoltrader.com

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I'm the one scheduling all that stuff

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
So we definitely want to have you guys on

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Also we want to mention

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
dig.com just recently added podcasting

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
To their listing

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
And we want to thank you guys who've dug us

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Considering we haven't really mentioned it on the show

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Or on the front page of the site

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
We did give it a shout out on the forums

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
They've been helping out with that effort as well

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
We've gotten 60 something digs

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
On the podcast, that's pretty cool

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
So if you feel like going and supporting that a little more

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
That would be awesome because it all helps to spread the word

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Which as you know

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Independent radio has to rely on

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
To get the news out there

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Because we don't have no magazine that gives us free

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Two, three page spreads in to promote our product

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
So you have to go on there

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
And vote

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
And isn't it interesting

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
That even that being said

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Because they're so out there

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
And so pushed

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
They end up getting dug the most too

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Well they do have employees that can go and dig

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I suppose that's true too

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Anywho, let's get into some gaming news

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Starting with Loki

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
And of course this week

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
We had two updates to it

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
The forecast channel

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
And the internet channel being added

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
The forecast channel is, well, weather

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
And it was pretty simplistic

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
But fun to play around with

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I think we all spun the globe a lot

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Because I was bored

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I think we all spun the globe

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
That's what you do with globes

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
When I was in school and I'd find a globe

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I'd spin it

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
We would try to find the funniest city name

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Is what we used to do with the globe

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I would take stickers

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
And paste them all over the globe

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I was very disappointed though

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
No five day forecast for Antarctica

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
How am I supposed to know what the weather is going to be like

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
For the rest of the week

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
The forecast for Antarctica

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
COLD MOTHERFUCKER

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Watch out for penguins

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Anyways

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
So those have been the launch

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
The of course internet channel is free

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Until June 2007

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Or June 30, 2007

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Which it'll be pay afterwards

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Five bucks afterwards

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Right now I guess they're considering it a beta

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Why is it not done

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Damn you Opera

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I mean come on, finish the fucking thing

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Whatever

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
So they're working the kinks out

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
It'll be updated I'm assuming for free

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Everyone's assuming, oh we're all going to have to pay for it

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
In July or whatever

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I don't think so

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I think they're just going to update it

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And so look forward to that

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
And then of course I think in January

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
We're going to be getting the news channel

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Which hopefully will have a way to sign up for different RSS feeds and stuff

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
Because I don't really give a shit about the world news

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Whatever

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
Yeah they're really trying to turn the Wii into the front page of Yahoo

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
Well what do you think though about the browser channel

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I think it's pretty good

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I'm glad it does support Flash

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Because you'll see a lot more from OLR Wii.com

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
I've got some good plans for that

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Hurry hurry

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
And what's good though is it's definitely a lot easier to browse than say the PSP browser

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
That's for sure

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I don't know how long it will be before we actually

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
It's actually kind of weird

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
It's a little bit easier to browse than the PS3 browser too

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Because apparently their text entry sucks too

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
But I'm wondering how long it will be before we see a 360 browser

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Because they got to jump on the bandwagon

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I don't know

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
It's pretty cool

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I know that the Wiicade stuff doesn't work too well

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Everyone was hoping that site would be good

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
But they have to downgrade all their games for Flash 7

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
It was okay

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
They're pretty fun

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
That's pretty much all I have

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
It's a good start

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Did you check out any YouTube

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Because I went to YouTube

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Not bad

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
It's pretty cool that YouTube will work on the Wii browser

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
The only problem is that you've got that navigation bar

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
That does not go away

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
That sits there on the bottom fifth of the screen

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
So when you make YouTube full screen

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Your video is still only in a tiny little box

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Well it's not a tiny box

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
But when you're looking at a big widescreen TV

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
It doesn't take up a big portion of it

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
So I kind of wish there was a way to make that stuff bigger

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Because YouTube is a pretty awesome site

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
To be looking at on the Wii

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
You can get everybody in the living room

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
And what I did is I created my own personal page

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Finally on YouTube

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
And I started bookmarking videos I really like

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Like the banana muffin

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
That our listeners are going to have no idea what I'm talking about

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
But you can bookmark these videos

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
And play them for people

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
So that's cool

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I like the Wii browser as well

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I'm looking forward to whatever you are able to come up with

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
For OLRWII.com

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Because OLRPSP.com

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
That site is still getting

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Even though we haven't really done a lot of maintenance

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
It's still getting talked about

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
And it looks great on the PSP

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
You did a really good job with that

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
So hats off to you

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Looking forward to seeing what you can do with the Wii

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Really?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I can't help it

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Yes we're looking forward to seeing what Matt can do with his Wii

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Let me talk

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Also about some other Wii news

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
A lot of folks are talking about Virtual Console

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And I thought it was quite humorous

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
That people thought Nintendo was going to throw them

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
A free game at Christmas

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Well I don't know

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I heard rumors that Sony is doing something similar

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
But I guess

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Folks thought Nintendo was going to throw them

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Super Mario Brothers, one of their biggest games

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
As a free game

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Considering how many times we've had to buy

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Super Mario Brothers

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Like the Game Boy one they had

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
And the Super Nintendo one they had

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
And all that crap

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
You'd think they could give us it for free

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
But no, it's coming out for 500 Wii points

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
On Christmas Day

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
But also coming out, ToeJam and Earl

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
R-Type for the TurboGrafx-16

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
And

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Super Castlevania

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Which should be pretty awesome

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Street Fighter 2 as well

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Even though I don't really plan on checking that one out

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Yeah you like R-Type?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Urban Champion

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I think it was Baseball

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
By the way, Urban Champion kind of sucks

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Like

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I know a lot of people think it might be cool

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Because they haven't really heard of it

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
But keep in mind this game was made like

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Before Double Dragon

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Before a lot of that other stuff

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Urban Champion kind of sucks

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
It's not going to be worth the 500 points I'm sorry to say

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
We need Bad Dudes

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
New Year's Day is kind of weak

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
But Christmas Day is very strong in releases

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Are you a bad enough dude to save the president?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
No it sucked on the NES

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
It totally sucked

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Compared to the arcade

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Did they make Bad Dudes on Genesis?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I can't remember

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I thought they made it on another system besides just the Nintendo

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Oh well

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
So you have those releases

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
To look forward to on Christmas

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Well speaking of releases

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Well

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
There are some

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Next week in the UK

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And by some I mean three

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Of course on the 25th we have Wii Sports

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Duh

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
On the 29th we've got

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
What the hell retailer is going to be open on the 25th in the UK

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
To sell Wii Sports

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Or whatever whatever

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I'm like yeah

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
And then also two PSP releases

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Free Running

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
And Lego Star Wars 2

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
The original trilogy

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
On the 29th

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Makes sense though that it's a slow week in the UK

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
It's going to be pretty slow over here too

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Right Loki?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Yeah it's extremely slow

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I want to say there's actually nothing coming out

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I'm pretty confident in that

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
And if anything it was just

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
A crappy ass DS game

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
And I really mean crappy like

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Board game collection type crappy

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Anyway so but we do have some

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Exclusive release dates for you

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
And I'd like to touch on something I was talking about earlier

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
In the show about how websites are carrying

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Exclusive stories that certain games

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Are coming out and that they have the first

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
News on it

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
There's actually a news art

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
News piece that's being run by GoNintendo.com

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Which is actually originally covered on

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Codenamerevolution.com

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Talking about High School Musical being in

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Development for the Wii

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
In case you forgot we did mention

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
That back in episode 206

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Way back in the month of

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
October and

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Gave you a release date of that as well

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
And in case you

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Haven't heard of that I believe it's

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Coming out in May

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
But who cares it's High School Musical the game

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I put this right up there with like happy feet

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Exactly it's a

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
It's a crappy game

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Can't you guys just kiss and make up it's really not worth fighting over

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
No it's worth fighting over

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Everything is worth fighting

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
No but seriously so

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
That's coming out and you know

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Great we did have a few other things

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
And these were actually some of these were mentioned

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
During the week you know I had them posted in our show

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
World but you know during the week more news

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Came out and we had you know some dates

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Being released of course like Prince of Persia

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Rival Swords for the Wii

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Being announced by Ubisoft and

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
That's coming out March 14th

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
What they didn't mention

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Though is that Driver

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Parallel Lines will also be coming out on

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
The Wii and the PSP

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
That is also the same day on March

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
14th and a week

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Prior they're going to be releasing their

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Game for the new Ninja Turtles

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Movie and that's coming out on

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Playstation 2, GameCube, 360

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
The Wii, the DS and the Game Boy Advance

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
And that's coming out

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
On the 7th

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Also from Ubisoft we've got

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
A sequel to their really crappy Game Boy

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Advance game Dogs, Dogs 2

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Which is coming out on the

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
7th of March as well

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
They have a music game coming out at the end of

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
February called Guitar Hit

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
For the PSP, no word on what that is

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
But it's probably some music and rhythm game

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Probably is ripping off on

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I've never seen a guitar rhythm game before

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
This is a completely new concept for me

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
It's on the PSP

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
So I'm not sure how well that's going to work

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
That's coming out on

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
February 28th

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Splinter Cell Double Agent finally making its way

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
To the Playstation 3 as they announced earlier this week

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
That's going to be March 14th

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Atari has

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Two Dragon Ball Z games coming out

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Dragon Ball Z Shin Budokai and other

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
For PSP

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
And other Shin Budokai games

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
And that's coming out March 14th

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And then Dragon Ball Z

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Haru Kannaru

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
It's a very long name

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Haru Kannaru

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Densetsu

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Legendary

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
For the DS

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
And that's a mouthful right there

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
That's coming out on the 21st of March

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
And then

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
You're going to love this

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Elder Scrolls Oblivion for the Playstation 3

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Delayed yet again

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
To the end of February

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Coming out now February 27th

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
What the hell

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
G, where have I heard this Oblivion getting delayed

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
For the new console thing before

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Where have I heard this before?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
2006 maybe?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Yeah, seriously

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
So it's being delayed yet again

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I don't know why they don't have it done yet

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
But whatever

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Alright

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Well thanks for the exclusive look at some of the US news

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
And so nobody else has mentioned that whole Oblivion

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Getting delayed thing, huh?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
No, no, but I'm sure a few months

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
From now they'll mention, oh by the way it's been

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Delayed, we have the exclusive news on it

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Because everyone seems to ignore

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Us

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
We're not a real legitimate site

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Because we love game in our title

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Coming out in Japan

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Also kind of slim pickins in Japan

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
This week, but you do get the Japanese

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Version of Prey on the 360

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
This week on December 28th

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Also on the Playstation 3

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
You're going to get Formula 1 Championship

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Edition coming out there

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Coming to the Nintendo Wii

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
You get, not a lot, you get a new memory

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Card there

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Coming to the Playstation 2 you get Formula 1

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
2006

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Yunimishi and Himihibi

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Princess Days

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Does that sound like a title you're interested in playing?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Sounds kind of cute

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Coming for the Nintendo DS

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
We have just a bunch of accessories

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Some pens, some covers

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
And an Animal Crossing mascot

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Strap and a carrying bag

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
For Animal Crossing

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Sounds like it might be kind of fun

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
You do get Dragon Quest Monsters though on the DS

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Dragon Quest games are always

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Pretty big deals over there in Japan

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Even though it's a spin-off game still

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Going to be pretty big

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
And that's really all I have

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Not a whole lot, it's a slow week over there too

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
And as I was going to say, the High School Musical game

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
I said May, because I was just completely pulling it out

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Of my head, but I looked back in the showroom for

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Episode 206

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
And apparently it was July 11th

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
May was Pirates of the Caribbean 3

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Let it go, Jesus

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Okay, I gotta get my information correct

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Okay, just in case

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Fair enough, fair enough

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Anyways

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Now that we're moving on from our angst aren't we?

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I think so, yeah

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Well there is talk of

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
DS and Wii

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
connectivity coming around

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
They're basically comparing it

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
To how it was with

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
The GameCube and Game Boy Advance

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
But they're saying that they're hoping that it's

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Going to be a lot better

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Whereas with the Xbox 360

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Connects to your PC for

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Streaming video and media

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
They're talking about more improving gameplay

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
And offering new experiences

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
The best news about this is that I won't have to

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Buy some fucking cable to do it

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Like you had to do on the GameCube, remember?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
To connect to your Advance or whatever

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
But then it didn't work with the Advance SP

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Nope, it didn't

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
It was so annoying, so annoying

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Damn you Nintendo, I'm still mad at you over that

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
That's why I still held onto my GBA

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Because I have to tell you what I want to see

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Come out again

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Is the Pac-Man Plus

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Or Pac-Man Versus

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Oh, Pac-Man Versus, yeah that would actually be a really

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Fun download title for the Wii, wouldn't it?

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
I actually

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
We still randomly play

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
That game because it's so much

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Fantastic, I mean it was such a fun idea

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Well also I think about, you know, they should really give

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Four Swords another chance, because I think a lot of

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
People didn't get into Four Swords on the GameCube

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Because of the fact you had to have all these people

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Had to have an Advance and all these people had to have the

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Cables, and it wasn't usually hard to find people

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
With an Advance, but it was hard to find people with the

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Cables to play the game with

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Same thing with Crystal Chronicles

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
I think we actually had to have two or three sets of cables

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
At my house just because of that

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Yeah, but you're, you know, you're a nerd

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Well I mean, it was just that we ended up

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Dan worked at Gamestop at the time

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Found him cheap, we'd just hold on to him

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
But it was really

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
I think in that respect though

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
It's, hey we make it require this

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
We can sell more stuff

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
So, I don't know

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
I'm really, really hoping that we get

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Not just

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
You know, like the one or two ones

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
That were out before, but get a whole series

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Of games that interact

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Between the Wii and the DS

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I could really go for that

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Is this how they could do that, Loki?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
How they could get more games to interact

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
With both systems

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Well, probably just

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
They'll probably start adding it on

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Kind of like they did with the Game Boy Advance

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Stuff, you know, where like, remember Metroid Prime

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Where you could download the original Metroid

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
To it and stuff like that

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
They'll probably start with gimmicky

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Stuff like that, hopefully maybe the new

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Animal Crossing will allow you to download some games

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Dream on!

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Actually, I have an idea

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
They should do

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Be able to turn your Wii into a demo station

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Yeah, that's been a long time

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Rumor, yeah, I remember

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Nobody's ever seen if that's really going to happen

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
But yeah, the rumor was you'd be able to download

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
DS demos through your Wii

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Just like you're supposed to be able to do PSP demos through the PS3

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
But if an Animal Crossing were to come out on Wii

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
That means that we'd probably get the island

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Back, that should be fun

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I think everybody's waiting for Animal Crossing

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
On the Wii, I don't know, I'm a little skeptical this time

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Because I was so excited about Animal Crossing

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
On the DS

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I was so excited about it and then played it for like two weeks

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And then I was done

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I think you should have a Mii game

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
You know, you make your Wii on your

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Your Mii on your Wii and download your Mii

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
To the DS with a little thing as like sub games

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I guess anything is possible

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Anything's possible

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I don't know

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
But one thing that they're probably not going to have

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
In Animal Crossing is the

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Wiimote throwing game

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Because they've been getting a lot of heat

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
On the whole Wiimote strap thing

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
In fact, of course, as I predicted last week

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Immediately the next day

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Class action lawsuit

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Filed for the stupid Wii strap things

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
And of course

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
He's so humble, isn't he?

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Hey, I mean, I'm not taking credit for that

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Because anybody could have guessed that

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
That's just stupid

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
I mean, of course it was coming

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Because people were looking to profit from all this stuff

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
So, some company, Greenwelling LLP

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Filed a national

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Class action lawsuit

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
On behalf of the owners

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Of Nintendo Wii, thank you them

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Because, you know, all these

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Wii owners are in dire need

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Of some money

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
No, you know what? You don't represent me

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
I am a Nintendo Wii owner since launch day

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
And you don't represent me

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Let that be known on this program

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Anyway, you need to say

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
I represent Wii owners except

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Rob from Orange Lawns Radio

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
And me

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
You should just say you represent stupid people

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
They said that basically

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
The class action lawsuit

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Rose as a result of the defective nature

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Of the Wii remotes

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Basically saying that the wrist straps

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Were not, you know

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Strong enough to withstand

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
The use of the player

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
And that Nintendo

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Did not include enough

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Instruction on how to use

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
The Wii remote properly

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
What? Oh my god

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
That's a Wii remote up their butt

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
That's a retard, I'm sorry

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
No, no, that's insulting to retarded people

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
That's just an idiot

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I'm sorry, I can't deal with that

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
And that it's basically

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
You know

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
What they're saying though

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
And they're looking to do is

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
The class action lawsuit is going to

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Basically correct

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
They want to correct the defect in the Wii remote

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
And provide a refund to the purchase

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Or replace the defective Wii remotes

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
And

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
You know

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
I think they're trying to also claim damages

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
For stuff that people have done

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
I can't help but think though

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
That they've sent out emails

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
There's a stupid indicator in the front of

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
All the games

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
It's built into the games for god's sake

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Built into the consoles on every single game

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Says the Wii strap thing

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
They've offered this free replacement program

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
If you want to replace your Wii straps

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
They'll do it for free

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
I told you in the instruction mails

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Do not swing wildly

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
And you don't need to swing wildly

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
And the commercials don't show them swinging wildly

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Granted they show them diving across the couch

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
But that's not swinging wildly

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
That's just acting like an idiot

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Well I think the best comparison

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
I heard about that though

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Is that like you know in a commercial

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
For a new car

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
They show them driving in the wilderness

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Doing all these stunts

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
And they always have that little thing

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
You know that you don't do that with a regular car

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
You just know that

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Common sense tells you that

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Common sense tells you

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
If you dive across the couch

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
You're likely to break the couch or a lamp

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Or your wiimote

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
But that's the risk you take

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
It had warnings

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
They made the warnings abundant

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Three words

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Idiot

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Well this comes down to Nintendo

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Of course this is without merit

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
We're going to see what we just said

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
About the Wii

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
That they've given way more than enough

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Precautions and stuff

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
And people are stupid

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
It's just like you know

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
You don't see lawsuits out there for people

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Throwing baseball bats and hitting somebody with them

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
And them suing the baseball bat company

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Because they're stupid and let go of the bat

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
They know they're not supposed to do that

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Well just like you know you're not supposed to swing

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
The remote like a 90 mile an hour fastball

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
And just because your hands became slippery

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Well you know if I had a knife

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
And my hands were slippery and I accidentally

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Stabbed someone with the knife

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
It's my old damn fault not the knife company

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Because they made their knives sharp

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
It's just

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
It's really dumb and I hope to god

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
That they have somebody out there

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
That sees this case and throws it out of court

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
You know but

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Did they say this might go to jury trial

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Or that's what they want? Is they want a jury trial out of this?

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Well they were

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I think the lawsuit was

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
On the Xbox 360 where they were seeking

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Five million dollars for

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
They haven't really said a number

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
That they're looking to get yet

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
But I mean from what we've seen so far

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
The Wii straps breaking has been

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Relatively rare

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
I mean it's happened

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
But you know people post it on the internet

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
And so it seems like a bigger problem than it actually is

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
And a lot of these

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
We found out as of last week

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
That are faked

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
So I mean

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
I just see this as just them trying to prop it up

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Let's take the fakers to court

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Nintendo ought to sue all the fakers

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
That would be funny

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Well that does make sense

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Technically it's perjury

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
There you go

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
I say if Nintendo loses money on this

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
They take those fakers to court

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
That would be funny

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Defamation

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Defamation suit

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I think that would be funny

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Now real quickly I want to say though

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Did you hear about like that trillion dollar lawsuit

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
That the RIAA

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Filed against that Russian MP3

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Company that was selling all of

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
MP3.com or whatever that site is

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Did you hear about that?

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
It's like one of the biggest lawsuits ever

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Trillions of dollars

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Like 1.6 trillion dollar lawsuit or something like that

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
There was another study I read

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
I don't even remember exactly what it was

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
But it was something that they were saying

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
That these claims, the damages that are being caused

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
By the downloads are a lot

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
That these companies are seeking for

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
And that

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Really the

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
People downloading these MP3's are not really

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Causing that much damage to them

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
All this news about lawsuits

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I don't know about you guys but news about stupid

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Lawsuits makes me very angry

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Does it make you angry?

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Everything makes me angry

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
You know what happens when we get angry?

37:31.000 --> 37:39.000
Music

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
The F you's of the week time

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
DarkSakura what's pissing you off this week

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
F you to mucus

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
And the extreme amounts of it that live in my lungs

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
And make me sick every morning

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
I hate bronchitis

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
I hate it

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I hate it

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
I hate it

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Remember Kefka? Oh, forget it.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Yes. Yes, I remember.

38:03.000 --> 38:13.000
But, um, I'd also like to just offer an F.U. to a tower video for not having any Dr. Who DVDs before they, uh, went on business.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Loki?

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
I'm pissed off at the lack of Wii games that are out there that- good Wii games.

38:19.000 --> 38:28.000
Because, you know, I'm really s- I'm kinda searching for some more stuff to play, and I bought a lot of stuff, and I have to say about, you know, 60% of it's been crap.

38:28.000 --> 38:34.000
And it's just- it's not because, you know, I picked a crappy game, it's just-

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
Haven't you played damn near every launch title now, except, like, Happy Feet and Avatar?

38:38.000 --> 38:45.000
Well, I haven't played, like, any of the, you know, Happy Feet, Avatar, SpongeBob, you know, that stuff that's ports off of old games like Ant Bully and stuff.

38:45.000 --> 38:51.000
But I've played, you know, quite a bit of everything, and it's- a lot of it's really crappy, and I'm-

38:51.000 --> 39:09.000
I'm starting to get a little afraid that, you know, maybe this launch for the Wii wasn't as good as everyone's saying it was, because a lot of the games are really shitty, whereas, you know, even like the 360 launch, a lot of the games, you know, I didn't like, like Perfect Dark Zero was pretty shitty, I thought, but it was a lot better than this stuff.

39:09.000 --> 39:18.000
But, I mean, look, to be fair, the games that were good on Wii were really good, like, you know, Zelda, and I thought Excite Truck was pretty damn good, especially for a launch title.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
Trauma Center, fucking amazing, especially if you haven't played the DS one.

39:22.000 --> 39:29.000
Here's the thing it's coming down to, is because Excite Truck is really good, it's like, yeah, that's awesome, I want to find another game like this.

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
Oh wait, there isn't anything like this, and next month there's only going to be one game.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Elibits wasn't bad.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Oh, I like Elibits.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
WarioWare's going to be pretty good.

39:38.000 --> 39:56.000
WarioWare's going to be really fun, but afterwards, what was there coming out afterwards, in February we've got like two games coming out, it's a big drought, despite what Reggie may say, there will be no drought in games or whatever, there is a drought in games, and it's like three games coming out in the next two months.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I'm sorry, they need more than this.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
Don't you expect that there's going to be a drought in January, February, for every system?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
What do the other systems have coming?

40:04.000 --> 40:20.000
The other systems, 360's got Lost Planet, which is a pretty large title, well, Battle Stations Midway, which is shit, and Fusion Frenzy, and then Playstation 3 doesn't have shit coming out for it, but Playstation 3 doesn't have shit coming out for it at launch either.

40:20.000 --> 40:31.000
And then Playstation 2, I mean, January, granted, is a slow month, but February does have a lot of stuff coming out for other systems, a lot of big titles, and the Wii's just kind of being skipped.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Alright.

40:33.000 --> 40:58.000
My FUs of the week, I don't really have a lot, so FU2 cookies for being so tempting and straying me from my diet this holiday season, because I've gotten so many yummy cookies, like, you know, Loki and Nellie made me some for Christmas that were very good, no offense, I mean, the cookies were great, it's just too tempting, and then some of my students at work made me cookies, and, oh gosh, it's too much, too much to handle.

40:58.000 --> 41:15.000
Let's get back into some news, and it's funny that you brought this up, but, you know, it was talked about this week, the whole delays for Wii games, there was some news going on that Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime could possibly be delayed all the way to Christmas,

41:15.000 --> 41:31.000
but then, of course, Reggie Fils-Aime discussed with Newsweek, not that long ago, he made a promise Nintendo would not have the launch problems they have with usual consoles, quote, Metroid Prime 3, which is a from-the-ground-up creation of Metroid for the Wii system, will come out in early 2007.

41:31.000 --> 41:46.000
This gives us fantastic momentum coming off the launch, and will certainly be an example of how there will be no new game drought for this system. Another from-the-ground-up Wii game that we are strategically timing to launch to make sure we are continuing driving momentum through 2007 is Super Mario Galaxy.

41:46.000 --> 42:05.000
You know, and they really are doing a good job keeping games coming out, Nintendo is, you know, because they've got WarioWare for January, Wii Play for February, Mario Party 8 for March, I mean, and that's already, you know, the first quarter of the year, and they've got a game coming out every month.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Can't say the same for other companies, though, because...

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
So it's the third parties that have to pick it up, but is it still kind of new, maybe?

42:11.000 --> 42:17.000
Maybe, well, and third parties have their development cycles, you know, March you're going to see a ton of games come out.

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
And remember how Nintendo wasn't letting a lot of them online at first?

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
That's stupid.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
That could be part of it, too.

42:23.000 --> 42:37.000
Nintendo needs to fucking get a clue, online's where it is now, and you know what, people were really excited about the online for the DS, and I thought, okay, because they saw that, let's take that as an example as, get this fucking console online.

42:37.000 --> 42:43.000
This Mii Channel, you know, exchanging Miis and exchanging messages shit is, it's old.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
It's old already, and we need, you know, some more online games.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
It needs some actual good support for the online.

42:50.000 --> 43:00.000
I also want to mention that it was previously said by Reggie as well that virtual console games may pick up the slack a little bit between the big, big support of the first parties,

43:00.000 --> 43:11.000
that that's when they'll release some of the big stuff people want on virtual console, such as, I'm sure, Kid Icarus, Metroid at some point, you know, Super Mario World on Super Nintendo.

43:11.000 --> 43:15.000
Those types of games will be strategically planned for when there's a drought of big Wii games.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Great, you know what you need to do with those virtual console games?

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
You need to put them online, like they do with Xbox Live Arcade games.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Put them so that you can play multiplayer online.

43:23.000 --> 43:30.000
Maybe not exactly as how they're doing it because the Xbox Live Arcade games have had a little bit of problems with some of the online components of them,

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
but multiplayer online with Mario Kart, I mean, that's going to be awesome.

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
Of course, they probably wouldn't want to compete with their new Mario Kart whenever the fuck that's coming out, but...

43:39.000 --> 43:47.000
Evie, you could really add a lot of oomph to some of these old crap titles, like baseball, tennis, Mario Brothers.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Well, I shouldn't say it's crap.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I mean, they all contributed to history, but now...

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
League of Pores at least.

43:51.000 --> 43:59.000
Yeah, you could really add a lot of oomph to these games and really justify the $5 price with these little enhancements, I think.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
It's not asking that much, I mean, I don't know.

44:02.000 --> 44:09.000
Well, you know, I'm sure there's a huge technical aspect when it comes to lag and all that stuff, but, you know, whatever.

44:09.000 --> 44:14.000
Well, excuse me for a moment while my voice fills me.

44:14.000 --> 44:21.000
There are a few rumors floating about, and one that I know a lot of people would really, really like to see.

44:21.000 --> 44:33.000
There are talks actually from EGM on the January issue stating that Katamari Damacy would be coming out on the Wii and Xbox Live Arcade.

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
I'm sort of not sure how it would work, you know, on the Wii, if you'd do it like Monkey Ball.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Probably like Monkey Ball.

44:39.000 --> 44:46.000
Yeah, but Xbox Live, though, it would definitely, it's a good idea, I think, for Xbox Live.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
I'm worried about the size limitation on Xbox Live, though, with 50 megs.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Well, I guess the graphics ain't all that.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
What's that?

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
I don't know, okay.

44:53.000 --> 44:59.000
I loaded my copy onto my HD loader, and it wasn't that big.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
I'd have to check it again, but it wasn't.

45:01.000 --> 45:07.000
Well, I'm hearing the rumors that they're going to up the live limit because the new memory card's coming out, the 256 megs.

45:07.000 --> 45:15.000
I think the 50 meg limit's stupid anyways, and to be honest, so you can't download a live arcade game to your memory card.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Boo-fucking-who?

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Who cares? Get a goddamn hard drive.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
Or don't use that part of it.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
Just use your fucking memory card for saves, and that is it.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
We don't even do that. We just use a hard drive.

45:26.000 --> 45:31.000
Yeah, the only thing I use memory cards for, downloading content from kiosks, and I don't even do that anymore.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Didn't we heart Katamari have a two-player mode?

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
It did, didn't it?

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Yeah, so could you imagine having that on Xbox?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Well, the original one did too.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
The original one did too.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
That's right.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
It was kind of a... I like co-op mode better for Katamari.

45:44.000 --> 45:53.000
It wasn't like, you know, it's no Halo, Gears of War-style multiplayer that keeps people coming back, but it's a nice addition.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
You know, makes it a little something special.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
That would be kind of fun on Xbox Live.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
I would love to see, you know...

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
I'd much rather play Katamari Damacy co-op than Gears of War, I'm sorry.

46:02.000 --> 46:08.000
I'd love to see the Wii version have your Miis as, like, the little, you know, characters running around in the levels and stuff.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
That'd be funny.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Oh, getting to roll over your friends?

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Yeah.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
That'd be fun.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Dude, that would be really cool.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Or they should do, like, as a...

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Are the massive people in your Mii parade?

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Yeah.

46:18.000 --> 46:25.000
Or they should do, like, a convert a Mii, an existing Mii into a little prince cousin.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Little prince face? Maybe.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
That'd be fun.

46:28.000 --> 46:34.000
I think that would be good. They have a lot of things that they can do with that, and hopefully they'll actually use all that.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
And of course, Loki will be all about the achievements.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Fuck that shit.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Yes, it will be all about the achievements.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
No, but anyways.

46:42.000 --> 46:54.000
Speaking of the 360, the 360 owner's got a pretty cool surprise recently, as Microsoft has upped their warranty from 90 days to one whole year.

46:54.000 --> 47:02.000
So if your console happens to be broken, or if it was broken, you're going to be getting a refund for your broken console.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
So that is pretty awesome.

47:04.000 --> 47:11.000
And definitely, you know, at least they're supporting their hardware with the issues that they may have for it.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
So, go Microsoft.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Hooray for them.

47:14.000 --> 47:19.000
Alright, hooray for this, too, because obviously I'm a big fan of Luminous, as you guys know.

47:19.000 --> 47:24.000
And there's a song in Luminous 2 that is just awesome, and it's a song called Heavenly Star.

47:24.000 --> 47:36.000
Let me play a little bit of a clip of this song.

47:36.000 --> 47:42.000
Well, this song, of course, is in Luminous 2 on the PSP, and it was just released for download on iTunes this week.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
So you can check that out by the Genki Rockets, a song that's called Heavenly Star.

47:46.000 --> 47:55.000
Well, this song, of course, since Mizuguchi had a part to do with this song, I believe he co-wrote it, it's going to be also making its way to Xbox Live Arcade.

47:55.000 --> 48:00.000
It's going to be in the Heavenly Star pack that's supposed to come out in January 2007.

48:00.000 --> 48:05.000
Now, we were also supposed to be getting the Artist pack in January of 2007, so we'll see what happens with that.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
Now, Q Entertainment hasn't said what the price for the Heavenly Star pack is going to be,

48:09.000 --> 48:16.000
but I would think that, you know, I would think that it would only cost, like, a dollar or something cheap.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
If it's just the one skin, I don't know if they're going to do remixes or what,

48:20.000 --> 48:25.000
but I would think it would be a nice thing to give away for free if it's just going to be one skin, right?

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
And it's such a great song.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
I hear it's going to be about a buck to download.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
That's not bad.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
I guess that's not bad, considering that's what the song costs to download, and it is a great song, and it's fun to play, too.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
So, we'll see what happens with that.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
I really like this song, ever since the video was posted back in the day.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Yeah, it's a good song.

48:42.000 --> 48:47.000
It's fun to play Luminous 2, but, you know, again, you don't want to rely on one song to push your game,

48:47.000 --> 48:52.000
so, you know, I would hope that they supplement this with some other, you know, artist skins that come out.

48:52.000 --> 48:58.000
Because, surprisingly, some of those songs in Luminous 2 weren't bad to play to, and even, I have to admit,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
even, like, Hall of Batgirl is kind of funny.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
I mean, just to have that playing in Luminous, I know we all hate Gwen Stefani, but, you know, it's kind of fun.

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
And, you know, the Black Eyed Peas pump it song, and Missy Elliott lose control.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
That's a great one to play Luminous 2.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
I'm sorry.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
They got some fun.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
They had some pretty fun choices.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
For the benefit of our listeners, I'm staring blankly at Rob.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Whatever.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
Then go to the next story.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Because I don't listen to any of that.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Go to the next story.

49:22.000 --> 49:27.000
Well, you know how we were saying that Metal Gear, not just we, I mean, a bunch of people were saying

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 was going to be multi-platform?

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
It was a rumor last week.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Yeah, it was a rumor.

49:32.000 --> 49:40.000
Well, an inside source at Konami is not really that reliable.

49:40.000 --> 49:47.000
It's been, they've come out saying that it's going to be definitely exclusive for PS3.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
At this time is the key word, or words, I should say.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
So they let themselves in and out?

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
It's at this time.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
It's just like they said, you know, what was it?

49:58.000 --> 50:06.000
Well, one I pointed out when they brought their version of the story that Splinter Cell was coming out on the PS3 as well.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
And they said, oh, we had no plans of this coming out on the PlayStation 3 at this time.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
And then next week they announced, oh, it's coming out on the PlayStation 3.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Oh, no, it wasn't that.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
It was Virtual Fighter V.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
That's what it was.

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
They were doing an interview for that, and that was a PlayStation 3 exclusive.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
And then this week, you know, 360.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
I'm going to say something uncharacteristic for me.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
I don't really think any other system can do the game justice but PS3.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Interesting. What makes you say that?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Playing Resistance Fall of Man.

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
You don't think they could do it on 360? What is it?

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
They could do it, but it would not do it justice.

50:42.000 --> 50:49.000
With everything that I've seen that they want to do with Metal Gear Solid 4, they're going to need the extra processing power.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
They're really going to need it.

50:51.000 --> 50:57.000
Because I've played a bunch of stuff on Xbox 360, and it all comes out really pretty.

50:57.000 --> 51:04.000
But I honestly, just doing comparisons for several of the games, I think the PS3 is going to be the better platform for the game anyway.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
I guarantee you this will be out on the 360.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
Not day and date, but it will be out on the 360.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
I'm going to have it on PS3. It doesn't matter.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Interesting.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
I never really got into Metal Gear past the old NES ones.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
I don't know. I somehow missed that boat, and I know I'm weird for missing it.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Rob, do you believe that love can bloom on a battlefield?

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
Shut up.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
They basically, it's all about money. That's what it is.

51:28.000 --> 51:34.000
If the PlayStation 3 has 200,000 units out there, or say, okay, by the end of...

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
What if the PS3 suddenly takes off between this and Final Fantasy 13?

51:37.000 --> 51:43.000
That's exactly it. If the PlayStation 3 takes off between now and whenever, then yeah.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Then it probably will be exclusive to PlayStation 3.

51:45.000 --> 51:52.000
But, right now, since the 360 has a jump on them by millions of units, it's coming out on the 360.

51:52.000 --> 51:58.000
They would be dumb to just say, oh, you know, we don't like money, so we're just not going to make it for the 360.

51:58.000 --> 52:05.000
It can be made on the 360 as all these other PlayStation 3 games, and it will be made on the 360.

52:05.000 --> 52:12.000
Just because they're exclusive right now, Sony does pay them for exclusive rights to some of these games.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
And so, after a certain amount of time.

52:15.000 --> 52:21.000
But the Xbox 360 does not have 6-axis.

52:21.000 --> 52:27.000
Yeah, and the PlayStation 3 doesn't have rumble.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Such flimsy controllers.

52:29.000 --> 52:34.000
Anyways, so, you know, great.

52:34.000 --> 52:42.000
And speaking of the PlayStation 3, Sony's actually in talks with Amazon for their movie download service.

52:42.000 --> 52:48.000
And, you know, because PlayStation 3, they're starting to kind of get into the more downloads and everything.

52:48.000 --> 52:52.000
And I've got to admit, they do have some pretty good stuff on their network service right now,

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
as far as the equivalents to live arcade games.

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
Especially, they're getting that Gran Turismo HD demo, which is not bad for free.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
I've got to admit, that's pretty cool.

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
And, you know, now they're talking about going the same way as the 360 and offering movie downloads.

53:08.000 --> 53:13.000
Which, this isn't a big surprise, you know, because it's Sony and they want it to be this media center type thing.

53:13.000 --> 53:19.000
So, of course, they're talking with Amazon because they have their digital download service as well.

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
And probably, you know, going to hook up with them on that.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
But I see this probably happening.

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
Especially with the PSP, I think they have their download service as well.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
So, what does this mean for UMDs?

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
This doesn't mean anything for UMDs.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
It means that people are going to be downloading videos to the PlayStation 3.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
UMDs, you know, are going to be like UMDs.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
Meaning they're going to be out there, but they're not going to sell.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
Is this to compete with 360's new little marketplace movie thingy?

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
Definitely.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Which I still don't like, because they don't have enough HD movies.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
They have like five, literally. I count five or six HD movies, that's it.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
It's literally, it's going to be to compete with that.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
And it's also going to be to compete with iTunes.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
That's exactly what it's for.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
Alright.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
Well, something else to be competitive in the movie world.

54:05.000 --> 54:10.000
Ken Kutaragi has spoken with Impress, that's a magazine over in Japan,

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
about an AV-centric PlayStation 3.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
This would have the cell processor powering,

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
and would, quote, be a standard AV component-sized box

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
with a more powerful power supply unit, anti-shake insulator,

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
and twice the main memory.

54:25.000 --> 54:29.000
And then it also goes on to talk about dual HDMI output for this high-end system.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
Now, this is kind of similar to the PSX,

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
which was a version of the PlayStation 2,

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
but it was just very expensive.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I guess you could kind of compare it to, you know,

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
like the Panasonic Q was like an AV machine,

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
but it also played GameCube games.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
So it's not necessarily that he's talking about replacing the PlayStation 3 already.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
But to me, it does seem a little early to be talking about this.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
To me.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
And it's also the dual-

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
It's like, make your PlayStation 3s.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
Well, the dual HDMI out, that was originally what they were talking about.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
I remember that.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
For the original PlayStation 3.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
Yeah.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Then, you know, apparently that was a little crazy,

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
and also the same with-

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
Well, actually, I remember the dual HDMI out for the PlayStation 3

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
was for multiple monitors.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Remember, they said that if you had two HDTVs,

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
who would have this?

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
Sitting next to each other, you could extend your, you know,

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
desktop to be on both of them for-

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I don't know what reason you would need that,

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
and who the hell would have two giant 50-inch, you know,

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
HDTVs next to each other?

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
Whatever.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
But that was one of the things that they were talking about.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
And now the price tag on this, I think what they were saying, $2,500?

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Who the fuck's gonna pay that?

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
I mean, seriously.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
The $600 is too expensive to sell PlayStation 3s.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Who the hell's gonna pay $2,500 for this?

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
Because, I mean, just because it has DVR and stuff,

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
you can build your own, you know, DVR system, high-end,

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
and buy a PlayStation 3 and still do it cheaper than this.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
It's just stupid.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
And the other thing, too, they're saying normal component size.

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
Well, that PlayStation 3 is not small by any means.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
It is already normal component size, if not larger.

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
I mean, so what's the size of this power brick thing gonna be?

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
I mean, is it gonna be the size of, like, a TV or something?

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
I mean, seriously, what are they talking about for this stuff?

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
I think this is still a ways out, whatever it is.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
I think they need to shut him up, is what they need to do,

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
because he is just spouting off retardedness as time goes on.

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
He really, he doesn't have a grip on reality.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
All right, well, we issued a challenge to our listeners last week.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
If you think the Sony spokespeople have no clue what they're doing

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
in the marketing department, create your own Sony ad.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
And we invited folks to leave us a voicemail on our Skype line,

56:40.000 --> 56:45.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, with their best Sony advertisement.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
And we're proud to say we have a winner.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
First off, we want to thank everybody that called in

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
and took the time to enter the contest.

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
It sounds like some people really, like, rode out, you know,

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
creative things to say, and you gave us a lot of laughs.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
So thanks to all you guys for entering.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
We want to play for you guys now, the winner.

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
Hi, I'm Sony's new spokesperson, Paradox Vincent.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
Now, look, the PS3 has been getting a lot of rap,

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
but I think that it's really just on this communication, you know?

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
You gamer people just don't understand the way the business works.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
So I'm here to clear some things up.

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
The biggest complaint we've heard is the price.

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
Too cheap, I know, but there's nothing we can do about that now.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
Secondly, some people say it freezes.

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
We're putting freezing technology in so that people can really get a feel

57:35.000 --> 57:40.000
for the true next generation look and feel on your 1080i television.

57:40.000 --> 57:45.000
To really feel like you're driving that car and you're shooting that alien.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
Or how you're in that giant robot.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
We want you to feel like you're a ninja or whatever,

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
stabbing the giant enemy crab.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
We get it, you know?

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
We understand that some people might not have HDTV.

57:58.000 --> 58:04.000
In fact, a great number of people don't have HDTV,

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
especially not 1080i HDTV.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
Well, we don't care.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
Leave us alone.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
I'm not hearing you, la la, la la la la la.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
La la, you're stupid.

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
All in all, it's the perfect gaming console, I know.

58:20.000 --> 58:25.000
The Wii's a pedophile and the Xbox 360 takes pictures of you while you're sleeping.

58:25.000 --> 58:31.000
Would you pay $600 for a pedophile or a pervert or a terrorist?

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
I wouldn't.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Make the right move.

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
Make the Sony move.

58:37.000 --> 58:41.000
Congratulations to Paradox Vincent for winning our little contest there.

58:41.000 --> 58:47.000
I think my favorite part of that is you wouldn't pay $600 to a pedophile or a terrorist.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
My favorite was la la la la la la.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
So good job, Paradox Vincent.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
We're going to send you some random things from our OLR prize pool.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
I know we have a DDR Extreme 2 bundle.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
Yes, that's Extreme 2.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
That's last year's game, but hey, those DDR pads are not easy to come by.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
So you get a bundle there and some other stuff as well.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
I think there's a DS game we have to give away too.

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
Don't we have a copy of Tao or something that's got to get given away at some point?

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
I don't know.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
You'll see.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
You'll find out what you get when you get it.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
All right.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
What a great contest.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
You get to win something.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
A thing, a random.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Think of it as Santa Claus coming to your house.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
Something's better than nothing.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Something random from Orange Lounge Radio.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
We'll be in touch.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
You win stuff here.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
More contests to come.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
We'll probably do something next week, so stay tuned to Orange Lounge Radio.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
Well, I have some news, and this makes me happy.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Remember Loco Roco?

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
Why, yes, I do.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Is getting a sequel.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
That's kind of a given.

59:44.000 --> 59:48.000
You mean one of the only PSP games people talked about a lot this year?

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
Getting a sequel?

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
No way!

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
Well, it was announced by Phil Harrison to MTV News.

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
Now, this makes me think, though, that quite possibly, I don't know,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
given that Loco Roco sort of flopped in Japan,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I'm wondering if they're going to have a more limited release there than they will here.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I can just hear that.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
I can see the interview now.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Yeah, we're doing a sequel to Loco Roco.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I don't like any of those Mexican games.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
What?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Because Loco, you know, Loco Roco.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Loco Roco is great.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Anyways, whatever.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I rolled my eyes, too, when she said they went on MTV to announce the sequel,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
but I don't get where you're going with this.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
This also looks very...

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
MTV's stupid.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
This picture looks like...

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
A penis?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Yeah, it does a little bit.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Jamie sees a penis in everything.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I do not.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I bet you wish you were in Second Life this week.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I know we didn't get around to that story,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
but there was some chick that was being interviewed in Second Life,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:53.000
and all these penises flew by on the screen like people threw dicks at her.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And I was thinking, Jamie should see this.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I actually tried downloading Second Life,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
and this is what, again, it was my fandom that inspired me.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Someone freaking made a TARDIS on Second Life.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
You nerd.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Well, it's not fully extra-dimensional like the actual one,

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
but they had it all laid out, and they had the current one,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
and then they had the Tom Baker era one in the different rooms and stuff.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I thought that was cool.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And then I played Second Life for like five minutes,

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
and then I was like, this game sucks.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Anyways...

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Yeah, Second Life, I don't get it.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
But anyways...

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
New Kingdom Hearts?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Speaking of Jamie fandom...

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Yay!

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Yeah, I'm sure this is news to everybody.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
They're making another Kingdom Hearts game that's a shocker.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Shocker! Why?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Why would they do something like this?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
It's not like the last game sold millions or anything.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
So yeah, they're making a new Kingdom Hearts game,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Kingdom Hearts 3,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
and of course this was sort of announced on the trailer

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.000
that they had for Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix during their Jump Festa show in Tokyo.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Yay!

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
And basically saying that a new project was in the works.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
So, Kingdom Hearts 3, something brand new to the series.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Well, something Kingdom Hearts-ish is coming.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Yay!

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Yay, they better have space paranoid in it.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And I'm here to announce something else that Square's going to be doing.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I know this is going to be a shock to everyone.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
After Final Fantasy XIII, there will be a Final Fantasy XIV.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Oh my god!

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
It's coming soon.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Oh my god.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Eloki breaks the world exclusive on Final Fantasy XIV.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Amazing.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I speculate there will be five versions of it.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I am actually thinking, let me think,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000
there will be another Final Fantasy game re-released on some handheld in the near future.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
There will be some type of re-release of some game from Square.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And there's going to be another Final Fantasy VII side story.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
After Super Mario Galaxy, there will be another Mario game.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Amazing.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
And there will be another Zelda game.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Well, we actually already know about the Zelda game.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
But there will be a Metroid IV in some capacity.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
There will be another Metroid game as well.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And then they will also re-release a remade version of the old Metroid.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And despite what the rumors say,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
if you think they're not going to make a Halo 4 or some type of Halo story,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
you're kidding yourself.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
All right, anyway, speaking of games that are going to be kind of expensive,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
as all those games are going to be,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
there was an interesting story run by Forbes this week

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
that breaks down the price of a $60 video game.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Of course, a lot of people are bitching and moaning because games are $60 now.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
I don't know if you've heard.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
But games are kind of expensive in this day and age.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And this is where your money goes.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
$27 goes towards the making of the game.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
$15 goes towards art and graphics.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
$12 goes towards gameplay mechanics.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Now, $12 goes to the retail markup,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
meaning that the store you actually buy it from gets $12

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
because it usually costs them about $48.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
And there's a console owner fee of $7.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And the retail and publishing parties involved

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
only really get about $1 for every game sold.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
They might be able to push it to $3 a game

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000
if they sell advertising in the manual or do some of that in-game advertising stuff

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
or what have you.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Interesting.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
That's where your money goes, if you ever wondered.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
That's economics for you.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Well, if you ever wonder where your emails go when you send them to Mailbag

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
at orangeloungeradio.com,

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
they go to the bowels of hell known as Jamie's House,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
where she opens them up and reads them

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
and finds some of her favorites to read for you all on air.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
So do you have some mail for us this week, DarkSakura?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Yes.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Damn you people, only five this week.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
What's up with that?

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I expect better of our listeners.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I heard there was a holiday or something going on.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
So?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
It doesn't take long to type.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I type 90 words a minute.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I have a letter typed up in, you know, three minutes.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Anyway.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Nah, but we got some pretty good emails.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
The first one comes from, I guess it's pronounced Igor.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
This is Igor, regular listener from Florianopolis, Brazil.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
That's cool.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I've been listening to you for quite some time

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
and I consider it a very good podcast.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Top five on my iTunes every week.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
By the way, I believe that you should be experiencing some problems in iTunes.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Stupid thing popped up.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Sorry, I had my DVD pop up.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
But I closed my case while it was reading so it covered email.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Anyway.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Okay.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
It's not the first time this happened at least twice in the last month

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
because I downloaded part A and it's only eight minutes long.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Does anyone also have this issue?

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Keep doing a great job.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Hope to see you guys down here in South America.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Sincerely, Igor.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I don't use iTunes, so I don't know.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I do.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I always check to make sure the podcast works okay on iTunes

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
and I've never been able to duplicate the issue.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
But you're not the first person I've heard to complain about it.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Unfortunately, there's not a lot we can do on our end.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I'm not sure what iTunes is doing to cause it or if it's a server thing.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
I think iTunes, if the download moves too slow,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
and considering how much we get hammered when a new show goes out

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
because we're distributed on the X...

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
God, now I can't remember.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Xbox Live?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
No, not Xbox Live.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
The XB stream.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Thank you.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
We're on that and that hits us every 15 minutes,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
so a lot of people hit our show right when it comes out

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
and I think it might be causing the server to move a little bit slowly.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
There are other subscription services you can use.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Yeah, there are other subscriptions you can use to get on the feed

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
or you can go to the feed directly

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
and just go to where it says download our podcast on the main site.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000
You can actually pull the MP3s directly from our page.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
And there's also, you know, you can use Yahoo podcasts,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
although they've fallen behind on the listing,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
so I don't know how much I support that one right now.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000
And Dig, but they mirror the show on their site or something kind of funny,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
so if you're not going to use iTunes,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
I would suggest maybe like Pod Nova or the, what is that thing called?

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Juice?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Or something like that that would pull down the MP3s as well

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
or go directly to the feed and save it from there.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
When I get them, I go to the feed.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
So I can tell you it's reliable.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Well, we have another one coming from Gorilla,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
which is cool because I'm the fan.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Well, no, I see Gorilla and I instantly think Gorillas.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Hey, kids, long-time listener and fan of the show.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Just wanted to comment on some things said on past shows

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
in regards to eBaying Wii or PS3.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
It's sort of a long one.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
So forgive me if I paraphrase a little bit.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I personally have no problem with someone selling their bought and owned device.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
If I own a PS3 for two minutes or two years,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I own it and have a right to put it up on eBay,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
sell it to my coworker or anyone else.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
If someone thinks this is wrong,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
then they should have been in line in front of me and got one,

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
and they could have done whatever they want with it.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
It's not my business.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.000
In my own defense, I did get a PS3 and I did wait in line for a Wii, so yeah.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I don't believe people should be getting anything the easy way.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I think everyone should work hard for what they have.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Or the game companies should make enough of it.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Yeah, there's that too.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I fully blame Sony and Greed for the state of that.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Excuse me.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
This is going to be an email.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I'm going to post on our forums, because it is long.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
But I'm going to read the last paragraph,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
because it sort of mirrors a little bit how I feel about it.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I'm sure you will edit this if you read it on the show,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
but the bottom line is this is my opinion.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
If you own something, no matter how long,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
especially if you put the time and effort to wait in line

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
with a bunch of people who you would never want to stand next to otherwise,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
it is your right to self-smash, burn, throw out a window, or keep for years

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
before selling it back to GameStop anyway.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
If people don't like it, then tell them when they see an auction for $3,000

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
on an already overpriced $600 device, don't bid.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I do agree with that.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Hold on, I thought you were staunchly against reselling these consoles on eBay.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
No, no, no.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I'm going to say this very specifically.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I am against buying them out for the specific purpose of selling them.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
For those people who bought 10 PS3s at 10 different stores in Japan

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.000
just for the purpose of selling them online, I have a problem with that.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I don't have a problem with someone, you know, and I did think about it.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I will admit when I can change my opinion about things

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
after putting lots of thought into it.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Say that this is your college tuition.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I don't have a problem with that.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I mean, if you take it home and say you, I actually don't have a problem

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
if you take it home, play this, if you know this is shit, and put it on eBay,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I don't have a problem with that at all.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Now, the one problem I have though with using it to make a profit for, say,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
your bills or for your mortgage is that it's gambling.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I'm not a gambling person.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Even though, yeah, just about everyone who sold one on eBay

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
has gotten a lot of money for it, you never know if you're going to get,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000
you know, a bum deal on it or if it's not going to go through

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
and you've wasted $600.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I love me the slot machines once in a while.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I like to gamble, but yet I won't do this.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
And it's, you know, I'm not so, you know, I guess if people are,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
if eBay is going to let them do it, then, you know, they have the right to do it

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
as much as I may not like it or I may not want to do it myself.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
But I do blame the buyer almost more than the seller.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I blame the buyer for making that demand.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Well, that's exactly the point.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
It's all those people who are not willing to put any effort into anything.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
See, okay.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
It's stupidity.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
If you're putting the effort into it and buying it, yeah, okay, you can sell it.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I still don't think it's right, but it is your right to do so.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I agree with that.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I don't think it's right for, again, those people who were basically

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
getting the edge on the market by buying 100 PS3s and selling them on eBay.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
That's, yeah, that's much.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
That's sick.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
That's abuse.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
That's sick.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
But I think that, yeah, all those people, though, who are paying the money for them on eBay,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
gouge them.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Make them pay.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
You know, because they didn't stand in line and put any damn effort into it.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
You know, those people deserve to get ripped off.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And if it's disposable income, then you know what?

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
They need to take those people away from, you know, their disposable income

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
and make them go work hard for something.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000
You know, I have a problem with that.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I think that people should actually have to work hard for what they have

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
instead of just having it handed to them on a platter.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Although I don't mind when anybody hands me anything on a platter,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
but I also work hard for everything else I have.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
It's a different story if you just get everything you want.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
If you work hard, you should be able to get something.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000
But anyway, thanks and love the show for keeping up all the good work and reviews.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
I did buy an Xbox 360 and am keeping it.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Oh, you're cool.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
It's from Gorilla.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Post your game and tag on the forums.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Join the OL Army.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Email from Chicago.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Once in a while you should have a retro game segment and feature a past system

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
such as the 3DO game system, which I loved and still own.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Okay, you're entitled to that.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I was way ahead of you.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Yeah, you're allowed to love it if you really want to love that system.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Before PS1 came out and killed it.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000
You know, actually, you must have ESPN, I mean, ESP,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
because look for something like that to be coming out next year.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
All right.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
There's more.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Right.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
More emails from mailbag at orangeontrader.com.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I'm going to have Learn Giants by the time I'm done with this segment.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
That's all right.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Hey, guys and girls, yes, Jamie, I wouldn't forget your angsty self.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Oh, thank you.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000
It's Nim, and yeah, it's been going good down here in Texas, I suppose.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
The stars at night shine big and bright.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Ow.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I can't clap with the microphone in my hand.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Sorry, can't help it.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Pee-wee.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Just recently I had an idea for a game.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Now, don't you start spouting off, I smell a kamami lawsuit.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Konami will sue.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Hey.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
But I was thinking of making a step mania type game for the arcade.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I have ideas and such, but right now nothing has been done,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
and I'm trying to get the word out.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
So you can say I love your show, and I know everybody else should.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Maybe I can find some help with this.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I'm not going to read out the email yet.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Enough of my shameless self-promoting or whatever.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Hold on.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
If it's going to change subjects,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
I want to talk about the step mania thing for just a minute.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Isn't that just in the groove?

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I imagine this person must have some type of separate idea

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
that differentiates it from in the groove,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
but it wasn't in the groove, just step mania in your case?

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Yeah.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
And, Loki, you actually had a step mania cabinet

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
that you helped build for a local arcade.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Tell us briefly, in a minute or so,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
what was your experience with that?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
It was a pain in the ass.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Why, what happened?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Just the computer...

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Normal computers don't like normal arcade cabinet environments.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
In other words, they get too damn hot.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
At the time, I didn't have the right tools

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000
to basically put an image on that type of a screen

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
because the arcade screens run at what they call CGA,

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
which is a very low resolution screen.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
But, it looks nice in the arcade because it's a really old screen.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
But, it's a pain in the ass.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Let me put it that way.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
But now, within the grooves, arcade stuff,

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
since they just run a PC anyways,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
you can actually buy a lot of this stuff from third party manufacturers

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
and be able to create your own step mania cabinet really easy now.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And, in fact, they actually built step mania builds

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
meant for arcade cabinets.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
So, if you build a cool enough computer,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
and it's also hard, too,

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
because you have to get the computer to turn on

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
with the actual cabinet stuff.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
But, if you can rig that all up,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
then, yeah, it's pretty easy to do once you've got the setup.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Alright.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
To continue with the email.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Let me get to my main point.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I recently picked up a Nintendo DS

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
and was hoping to pick up a copy of Final Fantasy III for it

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
at the closest GameStop.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Now, well, I have a good reason to get all angsty about the franchise now,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
seeing as how they didn't even have a copy in.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Before this, they sold me a defective 2DX game.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
That sounds like me.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
So, yeah, that's all I really have to say.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Still waiting to get a 360, or are we me being the poor bastard I am.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Um, you know what?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I suggest, um, I don't really think it's the GameStop

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
because they have the stock that they have at the time.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Use your phone.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Give them a call.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
You know, I live close to three GameStops.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
If I had been told by a GameStop rep previously,

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
I'm too busy to look, come down here.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
And that's when I decided I wasn't going to support that particular store anymore.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I realized that was that store and not the chain as a whole,

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
but that's when I realized I wasn't ever going to go down there ever.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Then again, usually all I have to do is say, hey, this is Dan's wife.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Well, you know, I don't get on the phone and go,

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I have a podcast on the internet, so you damn well better help me,

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
or I'm going to talk shit about you.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
No, I just call like anyone else does, you know?

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Well, I mean, usually what I do is I call,

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
and then if it's one of the managers I've met before,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
then I'll say, hey, yeah, it's me.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000
But honestly, though, really, I've found a few people who are willing to look

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
and say, hey, I'm going to be coming by if you have this.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
I'm going to be giving you money if you have this.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
But I've been in a GameStop when it's busy,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
and when they say they don't have time to look,

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
it means they don't have time to look.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
That is the fault of not having enough employees to handle the issues then.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I'm sorry.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
And having been sort of on the inside of it,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
that is the fault of GameStop corporate.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Then there you go.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
They do not want to give the hours they need to man the stores.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Well, it's hurting your business, folks.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I'm not going back to that store.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
It's not the manager's fault.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I teach customer service for a living.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I get offended when people do that kind of stuff.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Well, I was in customer service for a while too,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
and I know what I expect of myself.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Well, you know, what if they're too busy at that one time?

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Then obviously they're too busy to ring me up at the register.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Can I put you on hold, you know,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
and they could have one employee that's not necessarily working the register

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
because not everyone ever has to be working the register at the time.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
They have one employee to check on that.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
You know, can I put you on hold, you know, and...

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
They are supposed to put you on hold.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
No.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
And they are supposed to have you on hold as long as you're on hold.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
I walked right over to the next...

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
You know what?

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Instead, I walked right over to the next store Best Buy,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
picked up my game, left, in and out, very easy,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
and that's where I bought all my games for a little while.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Well, you know, and it's not really, I think,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
so much the fault of the store managers

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
because having talked to a number of them,

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
they're all like, we need more hours.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
We need more hours.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
We need more hours.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And it's corporate that's not giving it to them, so blame them.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
No, I don't know whose fault it is, but it sucks.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
End of story.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Last one comes from Nekky.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I guess that's how it's pronounced.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Downloaded for the first time off iTunes

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
and it's great, nice community feel to it.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
I'm from the UK, so can't do any of the live forums, et cetera.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Like to hear a few more stories about the UK.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I do our best.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I look when I can.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
WePlay is already out in the UK.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
In the last podcast, you said it wasn't out,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
but maybe that's only in the US.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
We probably were talking about the US

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
because we're not getting it until February,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
and I know we had a big story on the delay of WePlay last week.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Whereas you guys, I think you are just now getting Wii Sports,

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
whereas we had it as a pack-in with our system,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
so it was kind of interesting.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Anyway, looking forward to the next podcast.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Till next time, Nekky.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I'm really actually, I do try to look for UK specific stuff,

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
more like Europe in general.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I mean, honestly, I myself have a lot of love for the UK,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
and I want to make sure that our folks are covered.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Keep in mind, a big part of it is, too,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
is that a lot of stuff, and I don't mean to offend or worry,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
but a lot of stuff comes up in Japan in the US first,

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
and then the UK just kind of gets it later.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Not to say that there aren't specific things in the UK, obviously,

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
and Jamie tries to stay on top of those,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
but just kind of the nature of the business is,

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
most of the business is done in Tokyo and in the Bay Area.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000
So we try to keep tabs on release dates and things of that nature,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
because we heart our international listeners,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
but keep in mind, usually when games are under development and things,

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
it is kind of over on this side.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
But then again, they do get some games that we don't get,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
like mostly football.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Once in a while, once in a while.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Some of the games of that nature.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I try to keep my eyes open for specific ones.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
So think of it this way.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Hey, at least if we're getting the games first,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
we can tell you which ones suck,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
and then that way you don't even have to blink an eye

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
when they come out over there.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Exactly.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
For what little it's worth,

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
because we can't force the companies to change their schedule or whatever.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
By the way, I think we had a slightly increased listenership this week,

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
because iTunes had us,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
they have video games as their featured category and podcast this week,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
and we're one of them that's in the little box.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
So that's kind of cool.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
So thank you iTunes.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Is that it for voicemails?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
That would be it.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Alrighty.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
You mean emails?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Oh yeah, emails, sorry.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Give them my voice.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to leave us a voicemail,

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
because we're not unable to be live until January of 2007.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I want voicemail from some of our overseas listeners now.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
That's true.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
This listener could call our voicemail any time.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Now don't use the 800, but you can go through Skype.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Oh yeah, sorry, that's right.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
International folks don't want to use it, unless you're Canadian.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Unless you're Canadian.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
You can use the 800.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
But download Skype.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
You can actually just send us the message through the Skype line.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
It's a voiceover IP.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
It costs your internet connection.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
That's it.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
That's it.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
So go to orangesonusradio.com and click on Interact With Us for more information.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
It's all free.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
All free?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Yes, please.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Excellent.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Well, getting back into some news here.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.000
One thing that we talk about, especially in games and stuff, is all these ads.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.000
And a big thing when we were doing the Battlefield 2142 stuff

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:02.000
was that their advertisements had a little kind of a spyware feel to it

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000
because they were picking up your IP and where you're located and that kind of thing

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
so they could target ads towards you.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Not a huge deal to some people, but a big deal to others.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Well, apparently it's a big deal to some Californian lawmakers.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:24.000
California Assemblywoman Lori Saldana is going to be working on introducing a bill

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
into state legislation that would halt companies like EA

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000
from including spyware technology in games.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:39.000
And they found certain methods used by these companies as particularly vile, as she puts it,

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:45.000
and definitely something that I'd like to see passed because I'm not sure.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I don't think it's on our show roll.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
We were talking about advertising in games and somehow it's not very effective.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000
And so gathering information from these companies and EA is really bad on this,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000
especially with where you have to sign up and have your credit card information and stuff like that.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
It's not good.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
What I'm interested in is, she seems to get it.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Yeah.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Who is she? How did she figure out about it?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I mean, is she a gamer?

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
No, it's just, I don't know, she just seems to get it.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Because one thing we felt like we haven't had much of in the political world

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
is some type of pro-gaming champion.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I don't mean like a professional gamer,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
but I mean like somebody who supports the video games and the gaming community.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
We've certainly had a lot of anti.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I think she's kind of interested in, it's mainly privacy experts.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I see, so she's more of like an EFF type champion.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Yeah, and I think this just kind of relates a little bit to stuff like that.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.000
And basically she's saying that it doesn't advertise it on the outside of the packaging

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
and it contains the stuff.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
It's like you bought it and then, oh, by the way,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:57.000
we forgot to mention that installing this will actually send us some private data.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
And you need to do this in order to play the game.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I would just like to see someone who gets gaming in Congress, that's all.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Jamie, run for Congress.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Okay, pay my way.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Vote for Jamie, Kay, thanks.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Yeah, vote for Jamie, or die.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000
All right, anyway, well that should be interesting to see what happens with that.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I think that's kind of cool.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I think it's something that should, I think the companies should know.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000
They're going to be looked at if they're going to use these type of tactics, so I support it.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I'm curious to see what the specifics of the bill will be.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Since this is our holiday episode, this last official story we have for you guys

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
has to do with Bethesda and their big, big, big game Oblivion.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.000
They are giving away for Christmas a brand new expansion pack for Oblivion.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Well, it's not new, but it's...

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I was going to say, it's a Christmas theme pack or whatever.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
No, it's not a theme pack either.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
It's one of the older expansions. They dropped the price to free.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Oh, I thought it was a new one.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Oh, all right, well, whatever.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Maroon's Razor, which I guess used to cost money, it's now being offered for free.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Well, that sucks to everyone who bought it before.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Never mind, these guys are grinches for doing that to those people.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Unfortunately, I have not played any of the Oblivion expansions.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I apologize for my mistake.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
You know what expansion pack I'm going to be downloading?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
What? The Saints Row Ho-Ho-Ho pack.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Ho-Ho-Ho, does it come with Ho-Ho-Hos?

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
It comes with Christmas themed stuff.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
You know, I'm sorry, we missed this in our story.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
I don't remember this being mentioned unless I just forgot.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Gran Turismo HD is coming for free as well from Sony.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
So, tis the season.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
So, I guess Nintendo is the Grinch after all, not putting out anything for you.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Well, they did have the internet channel, so maybe not.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000
They did give you that and the forecast channel coming up the news channel too.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
But the internet channel, you know, is free.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
So, I guess we all got a little something for Christmas.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Now, here's something I got to mention though, and I'm not sure if you noticed.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Wii Connect 24, what the fuck does it actually do?

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Because it sure as hell doesn't update my system.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
It sure as hell doesn't download this new stuff automatically.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
What the fuck?

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I think it's one of those wait and see things with later games.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I think it's the type of thing where, you know, Animal Crossing,

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
people will visit your village when you're not there, type of thing.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Like, I mean, seriously, because, you know,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
it was supposed to be downloading the updates automatically so I wouldn't have to.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Like, so, poof, the internet channel should be there,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
or the forecast channel should be there instead of having to,

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
oh, by the way, the forecast channel is there, hit update, you know.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
No, it should be automatic.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Well, at least you get that message.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
That's, I don't know, you have the message, right?

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Nintendo sent you a little email that said the forecast channel is now available, right?

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Yeah, great, good for them, but it's not, you know, this Wii Connect 24.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
It's always connected to the internet.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
No, it's always connected, but it's not doing anything.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
All right.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Well, we have another segment here before we close out the show,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000
and that would be Dark Sakura, who likes to surf the internet up and down and left and right

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
and all that be-a-select-start kind of stuff.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.000
She finds a website that she must share with all of you guys,

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
and it's called Dark Sakura's Website of the Week.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And we have happy music.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
So this week's website better be happy.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I didn't do crap to find it.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
You told me about it.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Oh, goody, you used my pick.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
I made a suggestion, and it got picked.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I'm so excited.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Wekitty.com, W-I-I-K-I-T-T-Y dot com.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
This site is crack.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
It has a gallery of cats and Wiis, and it's so cute.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
You can see the kitty.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
So it's like stuff on my cat but with Wii controllers?

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Yeah.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
This is awesome.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000
This is fantastic.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I need to do one with Shermie.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.000
And on top of that, they actually say Happy Catter Day, which makes me think of 4chan.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
So, yeah, this is cute and those are kitties.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
I'm going to submit Shermie on Wekitty.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I'm going to go look at Wekitty on my Wii and bookmark it as a favorite.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000
I actually have Shermie snuggling up to an Xbox 360 controller.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
There you go.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Well, you should make 360kitty.com.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
No, I'm not going to pay for domain.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
They're cheap.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Loki, you can do it.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
I can do it.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.000
You should put like ps3kitty.com and have a PS3 crushing the cat because it's so heavy.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:23.000
No, I got it catbox360 and have like, do like litter boxes up like an Xbox.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
That would be rad.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I did notice that Wekitty did use the opportunity to give a big fat plug for the people who

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
made it their own personal little game review site.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000
So, you know, we could use 360kitty or whatever as a big plug.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I don't know.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I want to jump on the bandwagon.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
How about the Xbox puppy?

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Where's the love for the puppies?

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Puppies are stinky and they require too much attention.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000
I would admit that I'm a cat person over a dog person, but I do think puppies do deserve

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000
a little bit of love.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
How about dsgerbils.com?

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Lovehamster.com.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
There you go.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
With a P.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
When you say love hamster, start thinking of that corn cob vibrator and thinking that

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000
they should do like a hamster vibrator.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
No.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Last minute stories, anyone?

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Yes.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Are UK listeners want UK news?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I got some.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Pro Evolution Soccer 6.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
What's Cheerio then?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Hey.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
You know what?

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I hate all the ads on this.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Okay.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Pro Evolution Soccer 6 is now a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
It's the rival of FIFA 07.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:46.000
It's only available for Xbox Gold, but it will be available to Silver on the 29th.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000
It's a 1.31 gigabyte game.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Tell us what's on it because we don't know.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I'm not a football girl.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Isn't this the same one we saw an early build of at the Panami BBQ?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Yes.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Pro Evolution.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
It looked pretty hot for soccer.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Not that I'm necessarily.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Okay.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000
I have to say I do love football a little bit.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
You're a rugby girl.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
No.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.000
When I say football, I mean soccer because American football is shit.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Pure and simple.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Sorry.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
It is.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
It's crap.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
It's a crap sport and it's just crap.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.000
More people will probably watch football if they had cheerleaders like American football.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.000
It seems to be the most popular sport in this nation.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Yeah, and the rest of the world says, screw you, that's stupid.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
We like real football.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
It gives me excuse to watch men in shorts.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I like basketball.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Yeah, but you know what?

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:49.000
The rest of the world may be all about this metric system, but hey, we're too good for that.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
It's all about fucking base 12 systems.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Hell yeah.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
You mean the imperial system?

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Yeah.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Well, doesn't it sound much nicer to hear that it's 40 degrees Fahrenheit outside?

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000
It doesn't sound so bad as negative two.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Anyway, forget it.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Never mind.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Well, there's another one as well.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:20.000
For the record, I agree the metric system is better just to get that on record.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Nintendo has stated that the reports that came out of France saying that Wii Sports

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:30.000
was already in development is, quote, a rumor and speculation.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
But pretty good speculation of that, honestly.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Well, NGC France reported that there was one that might include swimming, basketball, a

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
few other sports.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.000
The quote, though, coming from Nintendo is really pleased with the reaction to Wii Sports.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:51.000
From people completely new to gaming to the hardcore fans, everywhere has taken to it

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
straight away.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.000
That's a quote from one of the Nintendo UK spokespeople, and they're actually speculating

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
it might be the most popular game.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Interesting.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
The love for Wii soccer.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Dude, that would be cool.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Would you kick your controller around that?

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I know.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
How would you do that?

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:13.000
You put your controller in the ball mode.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Well, it detects directions.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
That's a great idea.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Then people can kick the ball around the house because the Wiis aren't breaking enough

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
things around the house as it is.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Kick a ball through the window.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Real smart, Jamie.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
A winner is you.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Was I serious?

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
No.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Partially.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000
No.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Do you need to come out with the Wii Battle Axe?

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Dude, could you bet a golden axe on the Wii?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
No, I want, what was that, Time Killers or whatever that game was.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Remember back in the day when Mortal Kombat was big?

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
You had that game, what was it?

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:50.000
You had two buttons for arm and two for legs and one for head, and that was the game.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
What was that?

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
It was like Time Killers or something like that?

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I don't remember.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Oh my god, that game was awesome.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000
I mean, it was kind of stupid in the gameplay value, but getting to chop people's arms and

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:05.000
legs off and then they still have to fight with no arms or legs was really funny.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Clay Fighter, man?

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Your arm's off.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Alright, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Of course I do.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:16.160
So, the story came out, apparently there's a way modifying your own DVD firmware in your

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:19.800
own CD-ROM drive or DVD-ROM drive on your PC.

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:26.160
You're able to rip Wii discs, so now the pirates have won yet another battle.

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:30.040
It's only a matter of time before we see pirated games, you can run on the Wii.

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:33.520
Until Nintendo says, oh, you want that news channel?

01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:36.280
That's what they'll use Wii Connect 24 with the updates.

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:39.800
They'll just silently push out the updates that'll patch that kind of shit.

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:42.720
Well, they haven't done it yet.

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:43.720
We'll see.

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:46.600
And who says I have to connect it to the internet while I'm playing these games?

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:52.040
And to be honest, if they can burn them the exact same way as the discs are burnt now,

01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.040
they'll never know.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.040
We'll see.

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:55.040
We'll see.

01:32:55.040 --> 01:33:01.620
Anyways, that being said, let's see here, also, it's kind of funny, you know how if

01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:07.000
you register three games with Nintendo that you get a free three month trial to Nintendo

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Power?

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.340
Well, apparently the folks at gonintendo.com found out that the Wii internet channel counts

01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:17.920
as a game and now they get a free subscription.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:18.920
That's kind of funny.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:19.920
Does it really?

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.600
I mean, I have my subscription a lot of the time, but I actually have all my Nintendo

01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:25.840
products registered on Nintendo and it's a lot now because of those stinking virtual

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:26.840
console games.

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:30.640
I have the virtual console tied to my Nintendo account and you get credit for all those games

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:31.640
you download.

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:34.760
I really wish here in the US they did some type of reward systems like they did in the

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:37.300
other countries.

01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:42.520
If you're using the Wii browser and find that you really want tabbed browsing in the Wii,

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:43.520
well fear not.

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:46.960
The website has actually figured out a way to do that.

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:58.080
If you want to browse tabbed websites, you can check out team-dsx.net slash ds slash

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:04.440
basic dot php and apparently this was used for the Opera browser on the DS, but can also

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:09.520
be used for the Wii Opera browser to add tabbed browsing functionality.

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.360
I don't want tabbed browsing so much as I want support for my USB keyboard.

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.560
That would be nice.

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:24.820
And of course, since there was the free Gran Turismo HD demo being put out there, it actually

01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:32.080
ended up leaking a little bit early on the Playstation 3 network and crashed it because

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:36.720
it was more than it can handle, which is kind of fun.

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:43.280
We mentioned that Bethesda is putting out the free Oblivion expansion, or I should say

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:50.400
dropping the price on it, but more companies are actually putting out new content as well.

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:56.260
Test Drive Unlimited being one of those, you can now download a 1971 Dodge Challenger RT

01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:00.240
in the game for free and that's available in all regions.

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:06.800
Also going along with that, the Test Drive Racers Guild download set, which is 350 Microsoft

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:20.600
points, includes the Ferrari 612 and the McLaren F1 GT, Dodge Viper SRT10 coupe, and many more.

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.040
So that's kind of cool.

01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:30.960
They've also got a free Forza Motorsports Showdown trailer, which is available on both

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:34.960
Canada and US Xbox Live.

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:41.960
And then also three different Command & Conquer Tiberian Wars themes as well can be downloaded

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:47.040
for 150 points each, and actually they do have a trailer as well for that, which is

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.680
of course free.

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:56.120
And finally, Transformers, the movie trailer leaked out this week and was pretty awesome

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:57.120
on Yahoo.

01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:03.600
I'm kind of surprised it wasn't that bad, and keep in mind I'm not as attached to Transformers.

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:22.960
You haven't seen the Transformers movie trailer?

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:27.840
Speaking of the trailer, apparently there was some interesting stuff shown during the

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:32.240
trailer between the 37 second and 39 second mark on there.

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:39.160
There's a frame that shows Sector 7 Org at the top and Takara-83 at the bottom.

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:46.880
And apparently that, if you go to sector7.org and enter in Takara-83, it starts an ARG.

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:52.080
So brand new alternate reality game tied in with the Transformers thing, a new viral campaign.

01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:56.660
And then when you solve it, you get forwarded to All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com.

01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:57.660
Isn't that amazing?

01:36:57.660 --> 01:36:58.660
Yeah, that'd be funny.

01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:04.000
No, but it's a brand new start, so definitely worth checking out, I guess.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Alrighty.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:13.360
Oh, and I'd like to also mention, just to kind of start the show the way I started it,

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:18.320
1UP is reporting Earth Defense Force 2017 is coming to the US, and I do believe I mentioned

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.160
that on an earlier podcast.

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.160
So humble.

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.600
The great and humble Loki.

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:26.160
Alright, that's it.

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:29.600
It's only a one-part show tonight, because the holiday and the pre-tape and everything.

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:33.040
So this is the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.040
And I'll start tonight.

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:39.720
My final thought is January 22nd and heroes returning to TV.

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:40.960
I can't wait.

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:43.580
It's too long.

01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:46.760
At least I have some Kiefer Sutherland to hold me over.

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:48.760
Let me know when my man is on that show so I can come watch it.

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.800
He's supposed to be on the first episode.

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.200
So what is that?

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:54.640
January 22nd, so you better watch the first 11 before that.

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:55.640
What night is that?

01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:56.640
It's Sunday.

01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:57.640
F school.

01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:58.640
Damn you.

01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:00.520
Well, that's...

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:02.760
And on the 8th day the Lord gave us TiVo.

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:08.880
Yeah, and also just to mention, the volume is going to be on sort of moderate hiatus.

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:09.880
More info on the website.

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:10.880
Yeah.

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:11.880
Alright.

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:12.880
I didn't mean to...

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:13.880
No, that's alright.

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:14.880
Your final thought, then Dark Sakura.

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:17.280
Um, I need new lungs.

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:19.280
And reject false icons.

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:20.280
Loki?

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:24.400
Um, my final thought is, I'm not buying more Ubisoft games.

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:28.080
Thanks, I want to get somebody from that company on the show so bad.

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:30.080
I want a one-on-one with Loki.

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:34.640
Alright, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent radio.

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:35.680
We really appreciate it.

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:38.520
You guys keep it alive and keep us going here.

01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:40.660
We can't wait to head into 2007.

01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:41.800
We got one more show for you guys.

01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:44.160
It's going to be a wacky show next week.

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.800
Also, next week or the week after one of those shows, we're going to be celebrating our second

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:52.400
year, or I should say, moving into our third year of podcasting.

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:55.560
If you can believe it, we've been doing podcasting for a while now.

01:38:55.560 --> 01:39:00.160
And of course, on the 29th, Club OLR will be debuting on Friday.

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:01.160
Thank you for reminding me.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:02.160
7pm.

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:03.160
More news on the site to come.

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:04.160
Yes.

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:05.160
You need to post in your forum more information.

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.160
I'm sorry.

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:07.160
Loki.

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:08.160
Slacking, humble Loki.

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.160
Alright.

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.160
Thank you guys so much.

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:11.160
