Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and the Lowkey

00:13.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, December 31st, 2006, it's our year-end special with guests from the Bobby Black Wolf Show, STFU, Video Game Outsiders, Pod Culture, Travis Donovan Live, Destructoid.com, and Gamer Tag Radio

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody and welcome to another week, a very special week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, the gaming lifestyle, and gamer culture

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to my awesome co-host back there, it's Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Yo

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
How you doing?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
I'm amused

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Amused?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yeah

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Are you amused at this year-end special we're putting on tonight?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Yeah

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Okay, among other things I'm sure

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Among other things

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Alright, also say hello to the one and only tech master, Lowkey

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Hello

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
How you doing Lowkey?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
I'm doing good

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Awesome

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Alright, well tonight we have a little bit of a different kind of show tonight, we've invited a lot of special guests to come on tonight

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
You're probably wondering why did we do that?

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Well you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're dedicated to independent radio and giving everyone a voice

01:18.000 --> 01:26.000
And we do that through the Skype line every week, taking your calls through our 800 number, your voice mails of the week that you leave at 877-GAME-OLR

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
The forums, the mailbag, all of that

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
And since we always talk about supporting other independent podcasts, we wanted to invite some folks that either we've worked with

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Or even some folks we've never worked with before that just caught our eye

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
We wanted to invite them on tonight to just talk about the year 2006 and reveal

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
We'll get into that in a little bit, but it would not be an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, certainly not the last episode of the year

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
If we didn't start it off with How Was Your Gaming Week?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
DarkStakra, how was your gaming week?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
It was pretty fun

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
I played Cooking Mama at the doctor's office, which was entertaining

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
You were poking mama's steak at the doctor's office? That's gross

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I was pulling the heads off of shrimp

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I see

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
And then went to Roseville Golf Run last night

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
The horrible place that it is

02:10.000 --> 02:17.000
And I played lots of Derby Owners Club until it pissed me off that the G1 race was for mares and I had a stallion

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
But my horse pole-beater is awesome

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
For those that have never played Derby Owners Club, because they don't have a lot of these machines everywhere

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Please explain real quickly, for those that may not know, what is Derby Owners Crack?

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
The way the machine looks is you've got two, are they plasma screens? I think they are

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
I believe so

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
They're projection screens

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Well, the one at Roseville Golf Run has a ton of burn-in anyway

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
But they're two screens side-by-side so that you get a very, very large widescreen

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Then you have different consoles, they have one that's either four or eight

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
And you sit at that, you can pay money to breed horses

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
And then you train your horse, you race your horse

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
And after a while, after you start breeding your own horses

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
Off of your little cards that you get, you can get zebra-looking horses, albino horses

03:10.000 --> 03:20.000
One person last night had one that looked like that weird, I want to say it's in the same family as Antelope

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
That's got the white jaw, the zebra-striped legs

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
One of the other jokes of God, to say, hi, I think I'm here

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
So what is so alluring about Derby Owners Crack?

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
You race your horses, it's crack, it's just addicting

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I actually was playing this game

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Why do people play Pokemon?

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
I was playing this game last night as well and I had a horse called Paris Hilton

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Because you get to whip your horse as part of the game

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
So it's kind of fun to say, hey, I'm beating Paris Hilton

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
My horse was a throwaway, I named him Poop Eater

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Which I guess DJ Poop Eater might appreciate, I didn't even think about it

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
But my next horse I'm going to do, if I get a mare, I'm going to name it Your Mom

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
So people say, what were you doing? Oh, I was with your mom last night

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
So, anyway

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
You're so mature

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I played DDR Supernova

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
That machine sucks

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I mean, the game was fun, it was pretty cool

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Except the pads were, it was the same old crappy extreme machine that was at Roseville Golf Land

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
And the pads were shitty

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
And I think, though, when we were playing You're Not Here

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I think I twisted my knee because on the last song

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
My right knee just started to really kill me

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I'm sorry

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
That's why I stopped right, because you know me, I don't stop

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
And I was like, hell, am I old?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
It was kind of fun to go back to the good old days

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Because, you know, when the show started about four and a half years ago

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Wherever the hell long we've been doing this now

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
We all met playing DDR at the arcade

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Which some people who listen to this program may not realize

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
So it's kind of funny

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
But I went back to an old love

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I played Drummania

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I played a lot of Drummania

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
I have a blister on my hand, it's great

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
What do you think would happen if Harmonix put out Drum Hero next?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Would you play it?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Oh, hell yeah

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
As long as it plays like Drummania

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I mean, honestly, it was a lot of fun

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Now the thing is, they had a tall stool there, so I had to put it in auto-base

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Although I did try to play with the base a couple times

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
And it's just really hard, because I'm short and the stool was not

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
So I just put it in auto-base and just played all my favorite

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I was playing the old stuff more than I was playing the new stuff

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
But it is pretty cool

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Anything else you want to share with the gaming week?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Um, no

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Well, other than watching Extrovert play Devil's Crush

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Not Devil's Crush, Alien Crush

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
On the virtual console?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Yeah

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
It's Devil's Crush, though, because Devil's Crush is so cool

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
He says Alien Crush is the best virtual console game out there right now

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Which I entirely disagree with

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Well, Gunstar Heroes was a pretty-

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
I was actually pretty impressed at how well emulated some of these games are

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Super Castlevania IV for life, yo

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
They need to somehow put Dracula X on there, because then that would be

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Not the shitty Super Nintendo 1, though

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Alright, Loki

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I, too, played a game with a horse

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
I played Oblivion

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Final Furlong

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
No

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
I played Elder Scrolls Oblivion

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Because I thought I had sold it back

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
But apparently I hadn't

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
So I just loaded up a new save game

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
And went around

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
And I was punching horses and deer

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
And basically destroying small woodland critters

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
And it was funny, though

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Because when you start attacking a horse

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
They'll actually come after you

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
So I opened the gate and it chased me around for quite a while

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
And then a sheep

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I managed to kill a sheep

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
And it made it roll it down the hill

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And finally I stole a horse and jumped it off a cliff

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
And then the horse, no tumble to its death

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Which was funny

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
And then a deer

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
It was funny because there was a deer from far away

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
And I was just far enough away where I could hit with my

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
You know, magical missile or whatever

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Magic missile

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
So I kept shooting at the deer

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
And apparently the deer doesn't mind being caught on fire

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
So I thought it was funny

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
If there's any chicks there, I want to do them

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
I love Oblivion

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
You will only ever hear Bob say that

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
I played the demo

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
Because I am hell not buying this game

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Novadrome

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Horrible

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Horrible game

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
It was awful

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I would never play that game again

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Why not?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Why not?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Because the game looks like it's very cheap

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
It wants to be like a Twisted Metal type of game

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
But it's nowhere near like a Twisted Metal

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
It's just very boring and just very

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I didn't even really know what the hell I was supposed to do

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
At certain points of the game

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
And it was dumb

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
It was really dumb

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
The arenas are very basic and stupid

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
It's just

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
No

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
I don't think so

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Then of course, let's see

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
I played more Call of Duty 3 actually

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
More multiplayer in that

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Because that's fun

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
And we've been doing the thing now

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
Where it's either the anti-armor class

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Or the sniper class or whatever

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
And so it's either rockets, pistol, or sniper rifle

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
And we just play a match just using those

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Who's we?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
You and your co-workers?

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah, my co-workers and I will do it during lunch

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
And it's fun

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
It's really fun with rockets and stuff

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Because I'll be driving Jeeps over them and stuff

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And it's a lot of fun

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Alright

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Anything else?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
No, that's pretty much it

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Well, I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff this week

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
I went back to some really weird games

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I went back and played 99 Nights

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
I have no idea why

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
But I think I just wanted to get more achievements

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
So I'm going to play that

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
But probably the only new game

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
I gave some time to this week

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Was New Rally-X

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Stop laughing

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
I really did get this

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
New Rally-X is cool

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
You know what's interesting though

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
It's getting a lot of shit this week

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Because it was an arcade release

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
That kind of let people down

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Because they had a bunch of independent releases

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Hey, it's New Rally-X

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
It was a free game on a PSP game

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
The only reason I got it

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Is because I do remember Rally-X

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
From when it was in the arcades

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
And I did kind of like the game

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I did play Dig Dug and some of those other stuff

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
So I actually got it for the nostalgia value

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
The achievements are the easiest

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm so close to having the 200 out of 200

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
There's only one more achievement I need

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
And that's the I get to round 7 perfectly

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
And I can get to round 6 perfectly

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
So I'm almost there

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
So probably the easiest achievements

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Of any Xbox game I've ever played

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
In fact, I even put it to the test

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Xtavor watched me play the game one time

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
And then I said

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Here, you play on your account

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
And he unlocked 20 achievement points

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Just like that

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Playing one time through the game

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Having no idea what the eff he was doing

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
He got 20 achievement points

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Just like that

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
So if you want some easy achievement points

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
You whores

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Go and play Rally-X

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
And you can increase your e-penis standings

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
By the way, if you are a new Orange Launch Radio listener

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Check out our forums

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
OrangeLaunchRadio.com

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
And check out the OL Army section

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
It's our little clan we have across different video games

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Dedicated to just playing games

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
And the number one rule of the OL Army clan

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Is don't be a dick

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
So if you think you can do that

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Then join the OL Army clan

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
And join with some players who aren't being dicks

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
And you can join our e-penis leaderboard

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Which is provided through MyGamerCard.net

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
And you can see the standings of all the different people

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
And how many achievement points they have

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Or as we say on the program

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
How big your e-penis is

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Because that's pretty much what achievement points go towards

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Is how big your e-penis is

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Before we start bringing on the guests

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
First off, we want to say we've been taped for the past couple weeks

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Because of the holiday

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
But we will be back live on OrangeLaunchRadio.com

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
We tape live on Sunday nights

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
I know a lot of folks listen to us through our audio RSS

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Or podcasting feed

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
But we do tape live on Sunday nights

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
At 6 o'clock Pacific time

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Check it out over on OrangeLaunchRadio.com

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
We'll be back live Sunday, January 7th

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Also, speaking of live

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
This is a great show

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
It's a new show we have on Orange Launch Radio

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
That's live only

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
It's not podcast because it involves RIAA music

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
And you know you can't podcast that stuff

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
But it's Loki's brand new mix show

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
It's called Club OLR

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Tell them really quickly, Loki

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
What they can expect on Club OLR

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Fridays at 7 Pacific

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Basically, it's three different mix shows

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Kind of in one long block

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
The first mix show is basically

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Dancing, club music

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Some trance music mixed with video game music

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
So you have like long versions

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Like I think for this week for example

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
We had long versions of some of the Luminous tracks

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Some stuff from Luminous 2

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Stuff from DDR

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
And then of course mixed in with other trance and dance

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
And club music and stuff

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
So that was pretty cool

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
Then the second show is called Fragged

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
And this one is hardcore music

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
It's basically got a lot of hardcore speedcore

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Metal

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
You can throw some metal in there

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Drum and bass

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Just really you know

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
It's basically touted as music to kick ass to

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
You know the perfect thing to pop on

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
While you're playing a first person shooter

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Or something like that

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
And the last one is the OLR Underground

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
And that one actually is kind of a smorgasbord

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Of stuff normally

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Stuff you might not normally hear on the radio

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Like synth pop and stuff like that

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Or you know theme shows

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
It's kind of what I used to do on the old live wire

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Not necessarily all dance music

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
But just theme shows

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
And stuff you may not have heard before

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I'm looking at some of the feedback

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Because we debuted it for the first time

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
On Friday December 29th

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I'm looking at some of the feedback in the thread

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
You got a lot of great feedback

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
23rd Magus says

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Rock on dude

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
First broadcast kick some serious ass

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Psycoon says

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Whoa this is good stuff

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
You should post a list of what music you use

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
So I can go find it

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
And look at this from Vandalous

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
This is awesome Loki

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Plan on selling some mix CDs sometime

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
I'll buy them from you

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Otherwise may I contract you to make some mix CDs

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I'm serious

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
I'll compensate your time and media

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I love well done mixes

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
And your stuff is always fab

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
That's a great compliment

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Thank you

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
No it was fun

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
It's a lot of work

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
But I'm gonna stick to it you know

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
And it's really

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
The whole point is to have something for everybody

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
You know at some point

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
You know maybe

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Maybe you're not into trance music

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Or maybe you're into hardcore stuff

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I don't know

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
So that's what we have

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
The other cool thing about it

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
For the UK listeners

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Is we rebroadcast it on Saturdays at noon

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Or which is 8 p.m.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
You know London time

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
So

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Alright

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
So it's

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
You know a time that's friendly to you

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
To listen to it

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
So

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Or if you're you know in the United States

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
You get to listen to it twice

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
So don't say we don't love you

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Over there in the UK

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah we love you

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Alright

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Let's start off the show tonight

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Let's talk about a little bit of news

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Because even though it's been a slow news week

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Because of the holidays and everything

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
There have been some stories

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
We're going to do something a little different from our usual game

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Usually we all go around and we'll all share a little bit of news

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
But because tonight's show is a little bit special

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
And the focus of tonight's show is really our guests

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
We're just going to give Loki about 5 or 10 minutes

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
To just run down some of the latest news headlines

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
So Loki

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Take it away

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Tell us what's been going on this week

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Okay so there's been new firmware that's been released

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
For the PSP

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Homemade firmware

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
It's been cracked

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Because you know the last firmware

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
They had the PlayStation 1 emulator added

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
And they've had stuff on the PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 3

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
You can download for certain games and stuff

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Well someone's cracked that

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
And now you can dump any PlayStation 1 game

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
To play it on the emulator

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
So you've seen like Final Fantasy 7 and all that stuff

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
This firmware makes it possible

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
So that's actually pretty sweet

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
And they've had some pretty cool videos up from that

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Of course

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Now another thing that we've heard about is

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Price drops in the 360

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
And what's going to make that possible of course

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
Is the brand new 65 nanometer processors

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Which are going to be a lot smaller, a lot cheaper to produce

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
And a lot cooler

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Of course right now those aren't ready

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
And so it's actually being delayed now

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Instead of Quarter 1, 2007

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
It's going to be mid-2007

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Do you think that's actually going to cause 360's price to drop?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
For Microsoft it will

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
But they're not going to drop the price

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
At least not until Christmas

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
They just want to make money on their consoles for a little bit

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
They won't drop it until they have to drop it

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
So

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
So when Sony finally comes around and drops the price of their console

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
That'll be what Microsoft's response is?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Oh yeah

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Definitely

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
Mario Kart 64 is one of the titles slated to head to the Virtual Console in January

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Yay!

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Toe-tai-way! Toe-tai-way!

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
We're probably going to get it at some point as well

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
In March

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
This will make you happy though

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Additional classics coming to the Virtual Console

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Also announced for Japan

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Ice Climber

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Kid Icarus

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Yay!

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
And Zelda II Adventures of Link

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Will be heading as well

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And then of course more Genesis

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
God damn it Nintendo

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
God damn you

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Give us a new Kid Icarus

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Don't screw with the formula

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Just a fun little 2D game

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Like New Super Mario Brothers was

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Just a fun little game that I can play on the console

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Me love you long time if you do that for me

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Please, Nintendo

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Did you see the new things that they have

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Over at the Club Nintendo Store

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Whatever they have

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Tingle's Balloon Fight

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Not in this country

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Yeah, not in this country

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I have the thing tied to my Nintendo account

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
So every time I buy a Virtual Console game

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
It attaches to my Nintendo account

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
And believe me

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
I have almost filled up a second screen of channels

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
On the Wii

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
That's how many of those stupid Virtual Console games

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I've bought on total impulse buys

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Not a damn reward thing from Nintendo yet

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
I'm hoping

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
There are three months of Nintendo Power

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Which is lame

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Yeah, I got that a long time ago though

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
When I registered my GameCube

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Whoopie-doo

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Okay, anyways

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Sega Sammy's going to be teaming up with Sanrio

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
To make some Hello Kitty games

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Woohoo

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Oh goodie

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
And that's all I'm going to report for that

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Bad Batsumaru the game

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
K, thanks

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Anyways

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Capcom

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
They're slated to release

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
An amazing number of titles

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
77 new titles

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Across all platforms

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
So, you know

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Games on multiple platforms

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Count more as one

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
How many of those will be Street Fighter II rehashed?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
I don't know

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
I think these are new games

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Seven of which, I believe

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Are going to be for the

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
No, actually six

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Are going to be for the Xbox 360

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
So that's kind of cool

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Because they've had some good ones

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Wait, out of 77 new games

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Six for the 360?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
77 games total

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
But those 77 games are on multiple platforms

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
So if they have something on like six platforms

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
That counts as six games

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Oh, okay

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
I get it now

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Two rumored titles

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Of course were going to be

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
God Hand and Okami

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
But that ended up being a mistranslation

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Of a press release

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
So, not going to happen

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Tekken 5 has finally

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Hit the PlayStation Store

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
In Japan

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
And Dark Resurrection

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Definitely a really good title

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
For their kind of arcade service

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Is that out in the US yet?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
No, I don't think so

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Jamie, are you going to get that on your PS3?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Because you're the only one that has a PS3

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
The Tekken Dark Resurrection?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Because I know you're a Tekken fangirl

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Probably

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Yeah, 1080p Tekken 5

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
So that's pretty cool

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Pretty gin, Jamie

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Pretty gin

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I'm still holding out for Tekken 6 though

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Alright

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Anyways

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Of course, not a big surprise

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
But Christopher Gens is talking about

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Doing a Silent Hill 2

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Yay

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
You just want more Pyramid Head

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
No

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Okay

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
First of all

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
Red Pyramid is not my focus in Silent Hill

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
It's all the other creepy cool stuff that goes on

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
That makes me all happy

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
I love the psychological parts behind it

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
You know, I was checking something out

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I was looking at the various game blogs this week

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
And I saw something that totally made me think of you

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
And I want to say I saw it over on Destructoid.com

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
That they ran this story earlier this week

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
About a pillow that involved Pyramid Head

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Let me see if I can find it here

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
We're still taping live, boys and girls

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
So pardon the delay here

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Here we go, I found it

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
There it is

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
It's a little homemade Pyramid Head pillow

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
That says, rape sweet rape

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Aww

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
And I thought of you when I saw that

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
That's so sweet

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I want to, actually somebody on DeviantArt

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Put up a Pyramid Head plushie

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
And I want one

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
So it's funny

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
It's a bit of irony I guess

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
But remember last week we were talking about

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
The British sites getting penalized for selling

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Halo 3 beta codes

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Wait, wait, back up for a minute

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
On the Silent Hill thing

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I heard that the writer

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Or whoever they said was supposedly writing it

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Came out and said

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
No, I'm not really writing it

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
So is it still kind of a question mark or what?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I think Christopher Ganz wants to do it

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
But you know

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Alright

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Anyways

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
So as I mentioned a bit of irony from last week

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Where Microsoft was punishing those British sites

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
For selling Halo 3 beta codes

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Well come to find out

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
According to the latest issue of GamePro Magazine

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Microsoft will be selling Halo 3 beta invitations

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
With Crackdown

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Their brand new game coming out in March

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
Or not March, February

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
And I mean personally I was going to buy Crackdown

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Anyways

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
But this is more incentive to buy it

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Even if you might not want to play Crackdown

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
You're going to buy it to get a Halo 3 beta

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
It's like rain on your wedding day

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
But Crackdown's an awesome game

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
You should pick it up anyways

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
So

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
But if you're not a fan of Crackdown

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
And you maybe have a PC

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
And were a little bit disappointed by Red Steel

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
You'll be happy to

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
A little bit disappointed

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
A lot disappointed by Red Steel

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
GoldenEye Source

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
The beta has been launched

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
And you can download it now from the official website

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Which is goldeneyesource.com

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
And it looks pretty

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Definitely pretty

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
And then

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
You know we report on this

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Probably about every month or so

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
But

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Brand new game coming to the Dreamcast

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Kuros

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
And it's apparently a game

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
A new side scroller

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Like shooter game

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
And it's kind of a

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Black and white actually

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Giving it kind of a gothic feel

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Dreamcast fans look

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I know you're really attached to your system

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Dreamcast was a horribly underrated and great system

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
I understand that

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
But seriously you will not have another game

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
As good as Soul Calibur

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Or any of those games that were as good on Dreamcast

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
You won't

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
You think these new games are going to be like

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Classics

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
As good as

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
As good as some of those games you had on Dreamcast

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
For the benefit of our listeners

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I'm frumping it Rob

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Won't be Shenmue

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
I'll tell you that

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Won't be Shenmue

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
You can get some talented people out there to do stuff

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
I understand

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
But you know

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
It's just

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
It's not going to be

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Sega Swirl

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
My favorite game on Dreamcast was

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Freaking Rainbow Cotton

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Yeah but you're weird

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Anyway

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
I like quirky games Rob

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Anyways

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
There's another rumor going around

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
I think we mentioned something like this before

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
About the Playstation

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Portable 2

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
And saying that there's going to be

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Some sort of built in flash drive

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Or hard drive into it

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Well some more

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Stuff coming out

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
From Samsung actually

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
A presentation that they did

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Showcasing their 60 gigabyte

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
1.8 inch hard drive

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
It's not really a confirmation

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
However

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
There was a nice little

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Illustration that they had

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Showing a PSP

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
And it says

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Tagline

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Enjoy the movies everywhere

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Look you could put arms and legs on the PSP

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
So it could vacuum my house

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
And do my fucking dishes

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
But nobody's going to buy them until they

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Actually have more of those must have games

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Metal Gear Portable Ops

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Good start

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Luminous yes

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
But needs more

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
And then

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
One last thing I'd like to mention

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Because we were watching it before we started

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
The show here

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
And I highly recommend checking it out on

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
YouTube

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Saints Row

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Glitches the musical

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
And absolutely hilarious

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
If you haven't checked it out yet

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
You can check it out on the original

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Website that came out on which was

22:16.000 --> 22:32.000
www.cabel.name

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Or just go to cabel.name

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
And I'm sure that they have a link on there

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Hilarious musical

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
And all I got to say is

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
Where's my fucking car

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Alright

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Well as we promised

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
We want to bring on some special guests

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
To talk about the year 2006

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
In review

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
It's been a really interesting year

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
What would you guys say were some of the highlights

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Of 2006

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Not just in gaming

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
But just in your lives

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
That go around gaming

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Like you know I think of one of the highlights

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Being E3

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
You know every year E3 is one of the big highlights

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
And just us getting to go down to

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
The E3 Outpost

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
And everything and have a good time there

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
What were some of the highlights you guys thought of 2006

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Corny

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
But I'm going to go ahead and say it

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
E3 was just getting to meet Chris

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
For the first time this year

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Because she's been so much fun to hang out with

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And going to Disneyland

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
Which is why you miss all the shows you do

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Hey!

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
I love Disneyland

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
E3 was okay

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I was just sort of sick the whole time

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
So

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
And you know

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
It's sort of like E3 was going out with a bang

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
I guess

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Trying to anyway

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
But

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
That was I have to say among some of the fun

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Good stuff

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Loki

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Being one of the first people in the United States

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
To actually be able to play the DDR supernova machine

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
At Konami's gamer day

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Oh

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Okay cool

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
That's right

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
And then the Wii

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Alright

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Of course some of that like fire burnt out

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
When the actual console launched

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
It was exciting and then it's like

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Okay it's like just everything

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Yeah but that's because you've allowed yourself to buy

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
A lot of crap games for that system

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
You should have just beat Zelda

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
You should have just played Zelda till you beat it

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
No I really haven't been playing Zelda much

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
What the hell

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
I know

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Alright

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Shame

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Alright well look

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
What we want to do is we devise this little game

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
What we've got is we've got 15 boxes sitting up here on the table

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
And we're going to invite some other podcasters, bloggers

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Just people throughout the community to come on

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
And open some boxes

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
And throughout the week we've taped some interviews

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
With some of our buddies out there

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
And some people we never have talked to before

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
But we thought maybe they'd want to come on and say hi

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
And be a part of this

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
So we want to thank everybody who came on

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
And let's kick it off

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Jamie

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Jamie who's going to come on our show first

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
And open up the first box

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
We have Bobby Blackwolf from AllGames.com

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
Alright let's go to the phones where Bobby Blackwolf is there

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Bobby you there?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Yeah I am

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
What's up?

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Hey not a lot

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
How are you doing?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
I'm doing good

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
How was your holidays?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
It wasn't too bad

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
How about yourself?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I did pretty good

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
I did pretty good

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Yeah you've had a pretty good year all around

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Over at AllGames haven't you?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Well we're trying yeah

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
Well it seems to me that just recently I was on Dig.com

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Looking at their podcasting list

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
And someone's kicking our butt by a mile on the rankings there

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
And I think his name is Bobby

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Yeah I think y'all are joining him

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
What?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Y'all are coming up

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Well you're doing pretty darn good there

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
For just one guy doing his own show there

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Yeah it's hard to try to do it every week

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
And know that I have no net

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
But people seem to enjoy it so I just keep on doing it

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Well very good there

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Well Bobby you know you've been a long time friend of the show

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
We had a great time with you at the E3 Outpost this year

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
And just hanging and you know bringing us into the AllGames family

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
We've had an awesome time with everybody over there at that site

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
We definitely wanted you to be one of the first to play our little game here

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Called the Year 06 in Review

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
So you ready?

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
I'm ready

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Alright we've got 15 cases there

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
Pick one of the cases 1 through 15

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
7

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Alright let's open up 7

26:03.000 --> 26:10.000
Alright what did you think was the best voice acting in a game in the year 2006?

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
Now keep in mind Bobby had no idea of these categories in advance

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
This is all a surprise

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
The best voice acting in your opinion

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Damn

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
You picked a tough one

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Yeah I did

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
I screwed lucky 7 there

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
Cause Uno had no voice acting so I can't choose that

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
Well Uno kind of did have the people going you know F you draw 4 bitch right?

26:33.000 --> 26:38.000
How'd you play any of the uh you know well you can't do Zelda either cause Link doesn't really talk in Zelda

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
Hey hey come over here

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
Listen one of the ones I actually was really impressed and I like some of the voice acting so far in Final Fantasy 12

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Ahh Final Fantasy 12

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Which may not be something a lot of people talk about cause it's an old PS2 game

26:53.000 --> 26:59.000
But I mean I want to give that game a lot of props because I have been enjoying it

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
Final Fantasy 12 it's kind of interesting because you know it's such a landmark series the Final Fantasy series

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
I've personally been a Final Fantasy horror for the longest time

27:06.000 --> 27:14.000
But 12 kind of got lost in this whole shuffle of next gen systems which seems like such a shame because it's such an awesome game

27:14.000 --> 27:20.000
Right and you know that's why I'm not that far in it because I keep having to like look at other things that's going on

27:20.000 --> 27:27.000
And stuff so I definitely want to keep playing it and get farther it's just you know right now I don't have the time to get into it

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
And there's so many side quests too in that game like I feel like I'm barely making any progress in that game at all

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
You know with all the people that you can talk to and the hunts and all that other stuff so

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
Do you have a favorite character in Final Fantasy 12? Ask me when I'm a little bit farther in the game

27:40.000 --> 27:47.000
Alright I'm gonna tell you this I think it's all about Balthier by the way I don't know how far you're in it but he's the bomb

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
And he has a great voice actor I think that's one of my favorite performances of the year

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
Okay well since that was a tough category to pick a game for you get a really easy news topic

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
I'm curious about your thoughts the news topic that's in your case is bye bye E3

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
Of course the big news E3 2006 the last year as we know it quote unquote

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
What was your reaction when you heard the news about E3 you know kind of going away and changing for the new year?

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
You killed my birthday you bastards

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Did that news come out on your birthday?

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
No but E3 was on my birthday

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
Oh that's right they're talking about changing the time frame to it too

28:25.000 --> 28:32.000
Yeah so no to be serious about E3 for a second I mean it really got to be too much of a circus

28:32.000 --> 28:38.000
And it was very hard for me to see what I wanted to see because I had to wait for

28:38.000 --> 28:48.000
The old cash register jockey from Best Buy who got in and stuff and it was really people were treating it like the world's largest arcade set to free play

28:48.000 --> 28:56.000
When it was really about trying to get business done and trying to show what was going on in the game industry

28:56.000 --> 29:05.000
And things kept going behind closed doors people started like ramping back like the square presentation was not anywhere as good as it used to be

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
Yeah which is strange because the past two years before it it had been pretty awesome it was something I looked forward to seeing

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
But the square presentation I was let down by it this year too every single thing we saw was Final Fantasy something everything

29:16.000 --> 29:22.000
Right well you see what the thing that got me was that all we saw in the square presentation was video

29:22.000 --> 29:30.000
And I don't know how many E3's you've gone to but square has always put on this big huge theatrical production with the video

29:30.000 --> 29:35.000
But it incorporated the audience it was in like 360 degree rooms

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
The first year I went they did that that was like the 360 thing I remember that

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
Right but I mean they had stuff where they had in each chair they had like a little LCD screen that showed other information

29:45.000 --> 29:53.000
And I actually I probably should put these on YouTube I actually stunk my video camera in some of the early years to the square presentation and videoed the whole thing

29:53.000 --> 30:04.000
And I should probably stick try to get some of that because it's on old VHSC tapes from my old camera so it's trying to get into a format that I can put up on YouTube or something

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Because you're not supposed to have the cameras in there

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Yeah you get big trouble for that

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
Yeah I think I have like three or four old square presentations on video

30:11.000 --> 30:17.000
Awesome that's right now this was only my 33 this year but this is what you're like your 10th 11th E3?

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
This was my 10th I started going when they were here in Atlanta

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
Wow that's amazing so having been to so many E3's did you see this coming?

30:25.000 --> 30:31.000
I saw that E3 was getting kind of worse and worse off and harder to get things done

30:31.000 --> 30:40.000
And it just became more of a spectacle so I knew it was going to downsize some time but I didn't think it was going to downsize this much and for this reason

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
Yeah you know I don't know how Dark Soccer and Loki feel what they thought when they kind of saw that

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
But I kind of thought when I was walking around and looking at it I thought you know something's wrong here

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
When we have like this six hour wait to see the Wii and then a two hour wait to see Paris Hilton

30:55.000 --> 31:01.000
I remember getting diverted by Paris Hilton's bodyguards and I'm like something is wrong with this picture

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
This is not about video games now

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
Right it was about a big arcade and a big festival and it was like the mecca for gamers

31:08.000 --> 31:15.000
And so what they're trying to do with the new what is actually E3 is saying this is not for the gamers

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
We're not going to make this attractive for gamers to go to and in fact all the gamers are saying the new E3 is boring

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
But it's exactly what the industry probably needs

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
So you think this new E3 is going to be a good thing?

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
For the industry yes for the gamers probably not so much

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
So real quickly since we actually don't have this as one of the other topics

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
What do you think about the whole you know this new what was a game pro expo or whatever they're talking about

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
That might pick up that slack of what the gamers want do you think that's needed?

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
I think that those are needed because I mean gamers have been wanting to get into E3

31:47.000 --> 31:54.000
But the problem is I don't think that the big companies are going to go into the game pro expo as much as they did with E3

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
Gamers want to go to E3 but E3 is not going to go to game pro expo

31:59.000 --> 32:05.000
They're not going to bring the big lavish booths the booth babes may not be there in as much capacity as they were at E3

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
And so I think the gamers might get disappointed

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
So you think they'll have a lot of the same first year issues that a lot of startup cons have

32:12.000 --> 32:20.000
You know cons that we've seen in their first year that have needed room to grow such as you know the video game expo and penny arcade expo and all those

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Exactly

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
Alright well thank you so much for your thoughts on the E3

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
Now we're going around we're going to poll everybody today

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
Try to figure out definitively what in your opinion was the best game of 2006

32:32.000 --> 32:39.000
Okay the best game which is why I didn't vote for this in the best voice acting is Oblivion

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
And the reason that I'm saying Oblivion and not any of those first person shooters that I'm sure everybody else is saying

32:44.000 --> 32:50.000
Is because I have watched my girlfriend play this game for well over 200 hours

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Wow

32:51.000 --> 33:00.000
She's beaten the game like twice she's gotten all the achievements but she still keeps on going back in and saying oh there's another dungeon I can go loot

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
It's all the add-ons right?

33:01.000 --> 33:08.000
Right well it's not even just the add-ons she'll finish the add-ons and then just keep on going and finding new dungeons and she's been playing for over 200 hours

33:08.000 --> 33:18.000
So my thing is any game that is offline single player that can hook you in that much just like a World of Warcraft or an EverQuest could do

33:18.000 --> 33:27.000
That deserves props because I don't think people are playing Gears of War single player offline for over 200 hours and still finding new things to do

33:27.000 --> 33:36.000
Alright the interesting perspective how about the worst game of 2007 or 2006 we don't know 2007 yet but worst game of 2006

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Sonic the Hedgehog

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
Oh ouch any particular platform or just in general?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Just in general

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
What went wrong? Sonic the Hedgehog used to be so rad 3D

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Oh

33:49.000 --> 33:57.000
But this isn't the first Sonic 3D game you can go all the way back to Sonic on the Genesis but that's where it went wrong

33:57.000 --> 34:05.000
It was great as a 2D game but I don't think it's working too well as a 3D game and I liked Sonic Adventure but it was no original Sonic

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
Alright well I don't think you'll be the only one to pick that as the worst game of the year

34:10.000 --> 34:17.000
Looking forward to 2007 you know you do a lot of work with independent press and certainly you know Orange Lounge being in this all games thing

34:17.000 --> 34:24.000
and all games interactive and your own show kind of all pushing towards this independent you know news going into 2007

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
What do you think the impact is going to be of the independent gaming press in 2007?

34:29.000 --> 34:34.000
Do you think they're going to be more relevant? Less relevant? Do you think their credibility was damaged in 06?

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
What do you think is going to happen in 07 with the independent media?

34:37.000 --> 34:44.000
Some publishers will not understand it still but some will embrace it a lot more

34:44.000 --> 34:52.000
Microsoft has done a lot with the independent press because Microsoft actually gets blogging and podcasting and independent sites

34:52.000 --> 34:57.000
and there are places like you know I hate to say it because I know you're buddy buddy with them but Konami

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
the way they reacted to Kotaku, Joystick, whichever it was at E3

35:02.000 --> 35:11.000
that shows that you know some people just don't understand the independent press because we're not as you know in the pocket as the mainstream press

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
you know we will actually say what we feel instead of what they want us to say about a game that's in a preview

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
and so it's really going to be interesting it depends on how the companies react to the independent press

35:22.000 --> 35:28.000
but Microsoft gets it I think Nintendo is trying to get it but I think they're failing right now

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
based on some of the other independent press that I've talked to and Sony who knows

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
Sony just needs any press right now any good press they can get

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
Alright well tell us a little something about your show we want to let all our guests pimp their show so tell us a little something about your show

35:44.000 --> 35:50.000
Okay well it's the Bobby Black Wolf Show we do it Sunday nights at 8pm Eastern 5pm Pacific

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
and we try our hardest to end right when Orange Lounge Radio starts

35:54.000 --> 35:59.000
we're on All Games Radio we broadcast live on All Games Radio over at AllGames.com

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
it's basically like you said it's me without a net pretty much talking and then I read chat comments

36:04.000 --> 36:12.000
I take live calls and basically I try to give my perspective on things because I can get a mic and get on the air

36:12.000 --> 36:18.000
one of the things I'm going to be covering a lot in the beginning of 07 is XNA

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
because I am a programmer I've been in the programming industry a lot

36:21.000 --> 36:27.000
and I'm really interested in seeing how easy XNA can make game programming for people who can already program

36:27.000 --> 36:32.000
and so I'm kind of delving into that in some of the techy side of what XNA really is

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
I'll be very interested to see how this whole XNA thing plays out in 07

36:36.000 --> 36:42.000
I think it's just a matter of time before the end of the year I think we'll see our first user created XNA game on live

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
do you think so?

36:43.000 --> 36:52.000
well not on live arcade but there are people that have already created XNA games using the beta XNA because it's been out since September

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
you don't think anyone is going to break through that barrier?

36:54.000 --> 37:01.000
not to get on live arcade not by the end of 07

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
not by the end of this year

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
by the end of 07 you think someone will break through that barrier?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
I think someone will

37:08.000 --> 37:13.000
it will be kind of like the net euro say hopefully that Sony did

37:13.000 --> 37:18.000
where they took a couple of the best games and put them on a Playstation Underground CD

37:18.000 --> 37:25.000
that would give some of those gaming CDs a little something extra as opposed to the same demos you can download online

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
that's a good idea

37:26.000 --> 37:33.000
right because the thing that sets XNA apart from Xbox Live Arcade is because Xbox Live Arcade has that 50 meg barrier

37:33.000 --> 37:43.000
well you have two gigs with XNA so most people making XNA games probably wouldn't be able to condense it down to an Xbox Live Arcade executable

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
so it may have to be on CDs

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
well I look forward to hearing more about this progress on your program Bobby

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
yep

37:50.000 --> 37:56.000
Bobby Blackwell is always a good friend of the show thanks so much for being here and happy 2006 and best to come for you in 2007

37:56.000 --> 38:04.000
yeah thank you and happy new year to all y'all

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
alright thanks so much to Bobby for coming on the show

38:07.000 --> 38:13.000
it's Best Voice Acting in Bye Bye E3 were the topics he pulled out of that box

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
so it's kind of sad though that E3 is going to be different

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
it's not going to be the big deal it was before

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
but I don't know what do you guys think about that whole thing

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
well hopefully they'll do that well they have a bunch of alternate kind of events going on around that time anyways

38:26.000 --> 38:34.000
and if anything I think the lack of the official E3 will bring more gaming events hopefully some in Northern California

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
and more is better I think

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
well big thanks to Bobby for coming on the show

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
we've actually been working with Bobby pretty much all year

38:43.000 --> 38:49.000
we joined the all games community probably back in January or February I believe is when we joined up

38:49.000 --> 38:55.000
and we've really had a good year working with Bobby's show and got to meet him in E3 he's a good guy

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
very knowledgeable

38:56.000 --> 39:05.000
you know my other favorite thing of 2006 was meeting Bobby and Scott and Lawrence for the first time in San Jose

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
that was cool

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
that's true because we all went to the not Benihanas but some other type of place

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
just kind of kicked around

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
the almost Benihanas

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
and it was interesting because that was the first time I had seen Scott outside of television

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
so it was kind of interesting

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
surreal

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
yeah I remember seeing him on television I kind of used to watch that G4TV.com

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
and I was kind of like I don't know I don't know if I get this

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
but then having actually met him and interacted with him not only is he so knowledgeable with games

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
and you know just has a real passion for games

39:33.000 --> 39:39.000
but you kind of learn more about how TV can really alter the perception of like what a real person is

39:39.000 --> 39:45.000
you know and I know some other hosts previous hosts on G4 network across the board get some bad rap sometimes

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
Tommy Tallarico I met him at E3 and you would think watching him on TV like what a pompous ass

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
but no he's actually really cool he's really nice

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
and so I really enjoy that so it's pretty cool

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
alright

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Jamie who's coming on next?

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
that would be DMN from STFU

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
alright please welcome to the show everybody DMN how are you?

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
hey

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
I'm doing fantastic

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
hey alright it's been a big year for you

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
yeah it has

40:18.000 --> 40:23.000
you've gone from OLR fanboy calling in the show every week to having your own dang show on the network

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
yeah that's what I get when I bug you enough

40:25.000 --> 40:31.000
would you say that one of the highlights of 2006 was coming out here to meet myself Dark Soccer and Loki?

40:31.000 --> 40:37.000
that was actually quite a fun time despite all the crap that I didn't talk on the episode I appeared

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
well did you have a good time handing out the cookies and everything to the we line waiters when we did that whole thing?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
oh yeah that was a blast

40:44.000 --> 40:49.000
alright here's how it's going to work DMN we have 14 cases for you to pick from

40:49.000 --> 40:55.000
and inside the case is a game category and news topic we want your opinion on so what's it going to be 1 through 14?

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
big bucks no whammies 14

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
14 here we go

41:05.000 --> 41:11.000
alright your topic is game I most want a sequel for in 2007

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
this is a no brainer sneak king

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
sneak king? why sneak king?

41:17.000 --> 41:28.000
well I got a chance to play it over the weekend and I have to say that for $4 it's ridiculously simple and actually a lot of fun

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
and I need another game to buy my dad and scare the crap out of him for $4.07

41:33.000 --> 41:42.000
you know what's interesting is that game being $4 was better than some of the games that we were paying $5, $10, $8, $6 depending on what system it was

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
it was better than a lot of the games we were paying more money for

41:44.000 --> 41:49.000
it was better than a lot of the games that were retailing for $40 which is kind of scary

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
that's true that's true because when you consider there's certain games now I don't want to name names

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
but Bomberman X0 that they're charging $60 for

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
tell him I got a hedgehog sorry

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
well we'll get to what you think is the worst game a little later in the show so sneak king

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
you want to see sneak king 2 in 2007

42:05.000 --> 42:11.000
I do and I think Burger King would be smart to do it because those games are actually out selling Gears of War

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
well but wait a minute though that's a little bit of a warped statistic because you're putting the three games together

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
that's still pretty good

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
yeah that's still not bad

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
they're selling over a million copies combined which is incredible

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
yeah that's still not bad

42:22.000 --> 42:28.000
do you think that there's another commercial entity that Microsoft should be hooking up with?

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
I don't know

42:32.000 --> 42:38.000
no I don't know I like Burger King just because the king scares the crap out of everybody

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
I really don't see any other corporate icons

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
it did have a pretty freaky opening movie

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
oh yeah

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
maybe the jack thing from Jack in the Box that guy's kind of creepy too

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
that might work

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
alright here's the news topic we want your opinion on of course

42:53.000 --> 42:59.000
PlayStation 3 very controversial device this year specifically the Blu-ray shortages

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
the Blu-ray diode shortages causing there to be delays in PlayStation 3's this year

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
was it a good idea for Sony to include the Blu-ray with their console?

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
I think it was inevitable

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
I don't think Sony wasn't going to go with the DVD format anymore

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
I think they stepped it up with the PS1

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
they said you can play games and then you have your CD player

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
PS2 was like you can play your DVDs your CDs and your games

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
so Sony almost put it upon themselves to introduce a new format

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
yes it's a cheap Blu-ray player

43:32.000 --> 43:39.000
but I think Sony's problem was they were rushing to release this way too quickly

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
and had they have held off to Spring of 07 I think they could have had a better market share

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
but because they released in the holiday season they only got a total of

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
I want to say it worldwide 600,000 consoles if that to consumers

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
it didn't sell well and a lot of those PS3's actually went back on the shelves

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
because they wouldn't go for anything on eBay

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
how important do you think it is in the war on HD DVD

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
the Blu-ray is waging

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
do you think that being in the PlayStation 3 gives it an edge in that war?

44:13.000 --> 44:18.000
yes I do I think mainly because the higher

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
I don't say the higher end because we all know the first generation players are crappy

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
but the higher priced ones are about $1000

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
whereas the low end PS3 is $500 which is half the price

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
and it's about the price of a pretty good HD DVD player

44:32.000 --> 44:38.000
so Sony was smart in releasing at least a $500 price point on one of the versions of the PlayStation 3

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
to keep up with the HD DVD war

44:42.000 --> 44:48.000
but looking at it, it's about $500 if you get a 360 on an HD DVD drive

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
so it's the same thing

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
we'll see what happens in 2007

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
what Blu-ray movie are you wanting to see really bad?

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Talladega Nights

44:56.000 --> 45:01.000
I have no interest to see anything really in Blu-ray HD DVD yet

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
I'm looking forward to seeing Silent Hill at some point

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
because that should be second

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
I did say over the weekend I did see Batman Begins on HD DVD and it looked really amazing

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
we're also taking everybody's opinion and counting it up by the end of the show

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
what do you believe was the best game of 2006?

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
The best game of 2006 was not a console game

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
it was actually a handheld game

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
I believe that New Super Mario Brothers is the game of the year

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
New Super Mario Brothers game of the year

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
now this is something I've seen in a lot of top 10 lists

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
but I'm not seeing Take the Cake in many polls

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
why does this game take the cake for you?

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
well if you've seen throughout maybe the past 5-6 years

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
any Mario game that's come out

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
either has the word party after it

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
either has something to do with sports

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
or is a 3D adventure that's awful

45:50.000 --> 45:56.000
it was a breath of fresh air I think across all sorts of levels

45:56.000 --> 46:01.000
to see a 2D platformer that was fun and somewhat challenging

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
what do you think was the worst game of 2006?

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
that's a tough call

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
I would have to say

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
yikes

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
you must have played quite a few bad ones

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
oh you have no idea

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I would have to say

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
this did come out in 2006 technically

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
I would have to say Chibi-Robo

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
what's this?

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Chibi-Robo

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
it was released in Europe in 2006

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
oh okay

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
why this game?

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
it felt like it was ripping off Katamari Damacy a little bit

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
and while it was a good idea on paper

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
it was executed poorly

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
alright well that's one vote for Chibi-Robo

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
is that it?

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
yes

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
alright we got marked Chibi-Robo

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
I've never even heard of that

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
I love bad games I'll have to look that up

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
it's for the GameCube

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
alright

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
hey I got a question for you also about 2007

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
now I know you've got a lot of loyalty to Nintendo

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
because you work for Nintendo

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
so let me ask you specifically about Sony vs. Microsoft

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
because Nintendo has kind of decided to go in this whole different direction with the Wii thing

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
so where do you see the Sony-Microsoft war headed in 2007?

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
I see it headed towards new formats

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
I think Microsoft's going to be

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
they're going to try to make some point of making games

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
for that HD DVD drive to sell it

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
I think Sony is going to be a lot more focused on the PS3

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
I think one with their marketing campaigns

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
and just the complete lack of games for their PSP

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
they need to scrap that

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
as I've said on my own show

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
that thing needs to be dead by the end of 2007

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
because the more money Sony puts into that portable

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
they're going to lose even more money on it

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
so you think the PSP is a done deal

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
because there's talk about they should re-release a PSP lite

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
kind of thing like Nintendo did

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
but you say no scrap it all

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
if you release a PSP lite I don't know what you're going to do

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
you're going to have to

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
I don't know how you're going to make that thing any thinner

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
or more portable

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
because the things already

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
you can hold it enough

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
and the screen's so big

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
and I know Sony's not going to let a sacrifice

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
dumbing down that screen

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
I realize we're talking kind of the end of 2006 here

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
but do you think Metal Gear Portable Ops gave the system the kick in the pants it needed?

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
No

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
No, you don't think it's enough?

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
No

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
Alright, well quick give us a plug for your show DMN

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
that you have here on Orange Launch Radio

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Yeah, you guys need to listen

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
Thursdays at 7pm, Saturdays at 2pm

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
STFU with myself and DJ Tyrant

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
it's a lot quicker than this show is

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
What are you trying to say?

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
I'm trying to say it's 45 minutes and not 3 hours

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
I see

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Of course listen to this show too

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
If you need something a little more compacted

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
STFU is in a much smaller package

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
What are you trying to call small?

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Emphasis on small package with you DMN

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
Alright, in all seriousness

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
it's been awesome to have you aboard

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
and officially a part of the Orange Launch Radio family

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
and we wish a lot of success for your show in 2007

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
and I hear we're going to step it up

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
and do some more podcasting with STFU in 2007

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
so we can look forward to that as well, right?

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Oh yes

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
Alright, sounds good

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
DMN, thanks so much for being on the program

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
Thanks, and you have nothing to talk about with small packages

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
It's been a very interesting year, our relationship with DMN

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
wouldn't you say?

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
He kind of started listening earlier this year

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
and now he has his own show on the network, it's crazy

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
He's a very interesting individual

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
It was cool to meet him when he came out here though

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
Who texts my phone with pictures of DDR cups

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Yes, I got that text yesterday too

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
That's funny, but that was...

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
DDR cups?

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Yeah, he sent this picture of a DDR cup from Burger King

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
for no reason to my phone

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
I want a DDR cup

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Do they have those plastic cups

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
or is it just like their normal cardboard thing?

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
I think it's plastic

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
I'd have to check the picture again, but...

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
You know what's funny though

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
is actually since I do this retail site

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
like training for Microsoft

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
and they have free things

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
when you go through their training program

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
you can buy little chachkies and stuff

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
They have an Xbox 360 tumbler glass thing

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
I was thinking about buying

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
I should get one of those

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
By the way, while we're talking about DDR cups

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
we want to give a huge Orange Lounge Radio thank you

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
to our listener Misty

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
who sent us a copy of the DDR soundtrack

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
that they're selling at Burger King

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
and not only that, but

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Misty's always been a really great supporter

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
of Orange Lounge Radio

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
She sent us a gift certificate for Live 365

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
so January is Misty month on Live 365

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
because essentially she's paid for it

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
So we wanted to say thanks to Misty

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
and she also sent us samples

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
of the jewelry she's been making

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
She's been making OL Army jewelry

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
and selling it on our forums

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
and we gave the OL Army one to Jamie

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
for her cell phone

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
and she's been using that

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
It's on my phone

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
It's orange-ing it up

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
So thank you, Miss

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Everybody, thank you, Misty

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
Thank you

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Thank you

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
And thank you DMN also as well

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
for coming to visit

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
and that Wii line

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
when we went out and gave the cookies

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
and soda to the Wii line

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
That was fun

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
We met so many cool people

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
I hope some of them are still listening to the show

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
I saw

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
Was it the one chick that he gave

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
Was it a hat too?

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Yeah

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
I saw her at GameStop the other day

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
Really?

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
Yeah

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Did she recognize you at all?

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
No

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
I didn't say anything because I'm an ass

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
and I don't talk to people

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
but I saw her and I recognized her

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
She was in line with me and Chris

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
Yeah, she was cool

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
She was hanging out with us

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
Damn it

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
We should have emailed her

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
and brought her on the show

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Oh, well, we'll get her next time

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Well, if I see her again

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
I'll say hi

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
Alright, you do that

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
One more time

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
Let's say hi to some more guests

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Jamie, who's coming on next?

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
That would be

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
John and Michelle

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
from Video Game Outsiders

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Alright, and we're joined on the line

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
by Michelle and John

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
from the Video Game Outsiders

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
You guys there, Michelle, John?

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Woohoo

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
We're here

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Hey, how you guys doing?

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
What's up, you mother?

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Happy 2006

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Soon to be 2007 to you

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
That's right

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
Now, 2006 has been a really good year

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
for you guys, huh?

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
It has

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
We've actually kind of gone beyond

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
what we thought we would do

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
with this little podcast here

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
and we're enjoying it

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Yeah, awesome

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
You guys just recently won

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
like an Xbox award, right?

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
We did

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Podcast of the year

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
How about that, huh?

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
Very cool

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Congratulations, you guys

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
That's awesome

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Thank you

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Was that something that was

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
like community-based

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
or was the community voted

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
or was that like an editorial

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
It was voted by people who

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
listen to gaming podcasts, I guess

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
and that's why it was important to me

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
It wasn't just some old fat cat guys

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
in a business room somewhere

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
It was actually by the people

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
That's awesome

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
I think it always feels better

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
when it's something from the community

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Absolutely

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
That's great

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
What a compliment

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
How are you going to top that in 2007?

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I have no idea

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
John wants to do a naked episode

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
That's not going to happen

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
We're going to do a musical, actually

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
There you go

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
Wow, all right

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
We'll go with that

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
Oh, the big musical episode, of course

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
But see, that's when you know

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
your shows jump the shark

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
So be careful

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
Yes, exactly

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
All right, well, we've invited you

53:16.000 --> 53:17.500
guys on today to play a little game

53:17.500 --> 53:21.200
We call the year 2006 in review

53:21.200 --> 53:23.000
And what we've got, we got 13 boxes

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
on the table

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
And since there's two of you

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
Oh

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
We'll let you guys each pick a box

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
So, ladies first, Michelle

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Why don't you give me a box number

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
1 through 13

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
We'll take a look what's inside

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
I'll take number 4

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
All right, box number 4

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Let's have a look

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
All right, the category we would

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
like to know your opinion on

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
Best graphics in a game in 2006

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
The best graphics of any game in 2006

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Best graphics in a game

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
I have to give it to a game

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
I actually do not like

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Gears of War

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
Even though I did not like the game

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
I was blown away by the graphics

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
When I turned that on

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
I was like, wow, this is what

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
next gen is all about

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
And I know we're going to probably

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
have people yelling at me

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
for not liking Gears of War

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
But I'll get to that later

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
You know what's interesting?

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
Not from this audience

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Because we've said some very similar things

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
on the program

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
I've said the same thing

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
I think the game looks great

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
But I was let down by the way it played

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Exactly

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Well, that's a big relief

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Because at our show

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
We had a lot of people writing in

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
Like, how dare you hate this game

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
And you're crazy

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Stop playing your Tom Clancy stuff

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Tell them to sit down

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
People like what they like

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Exactly

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Sim it down now

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
I liked it

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
But the graphics were amazing

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
So that's my pick

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Hey John, since you're on the line

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
You want to buy into this too?

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
What do you think is the best graphics?

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
I definitely agree with Gears of War

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
The second game that comes to mind though

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
Is definitely I think Splinter Cell

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Is a close second

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
Double Agent

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
But yeah, Gears of War I'd say

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
Is definitely the best looking game

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
Of the year

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Without a doubt

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
What is it about Splinter Cell

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
That makes it stand out to you?

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
You know, personally I was a little

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Disappointed with Splinter Cell

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
I thought that the multiplayer

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Just was horrible

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Compared to what they did in the past

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
I loved K.S. Theory

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Yeah, and it was a huge step backwards

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
But visually, I just

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
I look at Sam's noggin on the screen

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
With all the sweat and the detail

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
And the stubble

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
The lighting

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
I just love the character models in that game

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
So it definitely stands out for me

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Alright, very cool

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Well now, you not only have a pretty

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
Big category there

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
But you have a really big news topic

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
We want to know your opinion on for the year

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
Michelle

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
And this is a news topic that seems to be

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
Something that keeps going on and on and on

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
Throughout the year

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
And it's somebody we don't refer to by name

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
Here on this program

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
But we'll call him Tack Jomson

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
Okay

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
Alright

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Alright, you know this guy, right?

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
He's somewhat of a bully

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
In the legal sense

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
And remember, he actually went to court

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
To try to stop the game Bully

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
On the Playstation 2

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
From even coming out

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
What is it about this guy, you think

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Why do you think this guy keeps wanting

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
To pick on us gamers?

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Why won't he just leave us alone?

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Well, you know, that's funny

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Because a long time ago on our show

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
I mentioned that this kind of violence

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
In video games

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
And I mentioned the game Bully

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
And John and Kyle, the other hosts

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
Shot me down

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
They're like, oh, nothing's become of that

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
And that's a fine game

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
It's really not that bad

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
But, you know, the angle of that

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
With the school kids

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
And I think that that's what's really

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Getting this guy going

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
But to me, it's fine

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
I grew up playing violent video games

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
And I feel guilty when I kill a gnat

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
So I think the guy needs to back off

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Well, yeah, and I kind of have an opinion

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
About this

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
I think it all comes down to parenting

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
And parents and all that in general

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
And I think that these are just like campaign issues

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
You know, I know Hillary Clinton

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
Kind of latched on to this

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
As a campaign issue

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
And I think like the soccer moms

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
I don't want to get political here

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
Soccer moms

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
I think that there's a certain demographic

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
That don't know enough about video games

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
And they just hear this stuff

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
And they say, oh, yeah, we should get on board with this

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
And we should ban this too

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
It's a bunch of crap, you know

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
And Jack Thompson doesn't know dick

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
About video games

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
He didn't even play Bully

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
He already decided that he hates it

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
And really, it's probably one of Rockstar's

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
Tamiest titles

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
You know, that's true

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Is that he really seemed like

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
When they let them all sit down and play the game

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
He seemed kind of mad that

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
They weren't showing enough of the game

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Like he seemed to know all this stuff about the game

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
But the game hadn't even out

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
How was he able to play it?

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
Exactly

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
Very interesting

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
You know, we've said a lot of the same things

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
On our show here

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
It all comes down to the parents

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
So I think it's very interesting

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
We have very similar perspectives there

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
But I wanted to ask real quickly too

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
About the whole Hillary Clinton

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
And other politicians

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
What do you think recently

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
And this is all kind of recently

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
In the November, December of the year

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
It's kind of been the Hillary and

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
Who's the other guy

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
Lieberman

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
Have seemed to come out

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Kind of embracing the ESRB

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Like almost that there's been a change in attitude

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
A little bit

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
You don't trust Lieberman

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
I'm from Connecticut

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
He ran as an independent

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
So we all are like

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Whoever, who cares

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
And first of all

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
I want to back up here and say

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
You know

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Our podcast is not political at all

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Yeah, we try not to go there

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
Because we get the mail too

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
You take us down a road

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
You take us down a road

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
But we never go down

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
You know

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
We just want to have fun

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
But yeah

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
I think this whole ESRB thing is a joke

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Unless the retailers really enforce it

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
It's absolutely meaningless

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
And I see these kids trying to buy

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Grand Theft Auto all the time

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
And I think most of them succeed

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
Some 50-year-old fat housewife at Walmart

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Is going to sell the kid the game

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
So come on

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
It's on eBay anyway

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
I mean these days

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
It's really hard to control that

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
All right, all right

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
We better get off this political road

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
Because I can see people emailing us

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
I don't want to go down there

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
All right, all right

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Then let's go to another box

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
John, it's your turn

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
Go and pick a box

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
1 through 12 now

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
I'll link to 12

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
How about 7?

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
All right, box number 7

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
Let's take a look

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
Most hilarious video game of 2006

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
Oh

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Most hilarious

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Okay, that's easy for me

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
It's actually Rayman Raving Rabbids

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
Whatever the hell it is

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
It's Rayman Raving Rabbids on the Wii

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Yeah, definitely

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
That game is off the wall crazy

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
So it's one of those laugh-out

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
I have to be honest

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
I personally haven't played this a whole lot

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
But I did notice it was somewhat quirky

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
When I took a look at it

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
It's very quirky

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
What is it about the game that makes it so funny?

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
You know, it's just got this twisted art direction

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Which I kind of appreciate

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
They really create these little mutant-looking

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
Rabbit characters

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
And you just kind of throw it in this little rabbit world

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
And it's just very bizarre

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
And it's funny, you know

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
And I think that's all it is

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
That's all I can say

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
All right, very cool

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
Michelle, would you agree

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Or do you have a different pick?

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
For me, I don't know if this is on the console or anything

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I'm going to have to go with OfficialLineWriter.com

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
What?

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Yes

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
It's a little web game

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Of this guy that's on a sled

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
And he goes flying around

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
And I laughed for like an hour

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
When I first played this game

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
Well, you're simple

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
We'll take it

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
It's PC gaming

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
We'll take it

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
It's a little PC game

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
I'm telling you

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
It's a gem

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
Try it out and you'll get a good laugh

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
All right, awesome

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
Yeah, you know

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
I was trying to pull up LineWriter on the Wii

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
When the browser came out

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
But now, I guess since they're going to make it an official game

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
They locked everybody out

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Yeah, I can't wait for that

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Yeah, it's a Flash issue

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Because the Wii only supports Flash 7 or older

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And that's like in Flash 9 or something

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Oh, we had thought that they shut people out

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Because they're going to be releasing the full version later on

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
As a game

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Yeah, it's a newer Flash version

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Yep

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
All right, and here's the story I'd like to ask you about

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
This is a little bit dated

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
This kind of goes back to way early in the year

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
But I don't remember if you remember all the furor that went on

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
When Microsoft announced that they were going to be creating this new system

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Called the Origami

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And for about a month, people were running wild

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Like, oh my gosh

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Microsoft's going to enter the handheld market

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
They're going to obliterate the PSP and the DS

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And da da da

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And then it turns out the Origami is just pretty much this fancy schmancy PC

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And that's why the screenshot of Halo was on it

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000
So this kind of bears the question about Microsoft entering the handheld market

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Is this something Microsoft ought to consider in 2007?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Yes

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I would definitely say so

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
You know, I'm a Nintendo fanboy

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
The DSLY has sold like 34 million units

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Compared to the PSP, which is like 18 million

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
You know, Nintendo owns that category

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And I think that there's definitely a need still

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
For a portable for an older market

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
You know, the Nintendo kind of is young and skews a little bit older

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
But not too old

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And I think that Microsoft, it's ripe for the taking

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Because they have the installed user base of the 360

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And yes, I think they should definitely do it

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Are you saying you want to have a dead or alive extreme volleyball on the go, basically?

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
No, I think that Microsoft's bigger plan though

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Is like to integrate the Xbox Live market into the handheld

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
So I think that's where the magic's going to be

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Where you can download movies or music or games

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
And then carry them with you in this portable device

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Do you think that's something they might end up trying to do with Zune

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Because of the iPod games and everything?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I do think that

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Because the thing about the Xbox is that you can download movies now

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
No music is around the corner

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
The thing is you can't get it off the console

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
You can't take it with you

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
So some device is going to enable that

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Be it the Zune or this other device that comes

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
So I think that's all part of the big picture

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I definitely do

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Michelle, what are your thoughts?

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Microsoft, do they need a handheld?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I think they should really get into it

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Because although the Nintendo DS is very cool

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I do not like playing multiplayer on it

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Because of the little friend code thing

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Now one thing Microsoft does and does well

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Is the Xbox Live community

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And if they could get that on a handheld

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I would definitely pick it up

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Because to be able to just get up and go

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And play with your friends no matter where you are

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
That's something that the DS just doesn't have

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
If you remember the DS didn't even get online

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
For about a year and a half

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Yep, exactly

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I agree with you there

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
That Xbox definitely knows what they're doing

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
When it comes to the online stuff

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Very good

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
One more question for you guys

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Actually two, it's a two-parter

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
We want to know, because we're taking a tally all day long

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
What do you guys believe is the best game of 2006?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Michelle, we'll start with you

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Michelle, what do you think is the best game of 2006?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
For multiplayer, I'm going to give it to Rainbow Six Vegas

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
But I want to talk about single player

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Because to me, I was not into single player games

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Until this game came along

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
It's oblivion

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I've spent countless hours

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
And I haven't played the game twice

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Everybody I ever talked to kind of liked the game

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Except for people who didn't have time for it

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
So it seemed to have something for everyone

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Worst game, do you want me to go right into?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Sure, why not?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
We'll take your worst game

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
What do you think, Michelle?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Although there were worst games

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
It's going to be Gears of War because I had the most hype

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Come on!

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Yes, because I wanted that to be good

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Because it had the capability to be good

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
And it just wasn't

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
So that was the biggest letdown for me

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
And that's why I gave it to the worst game

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
That is a gutsy, gutsy statement

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
It's a gutsy thing, everybody bring it on

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
You want to give out your email address, your gamertag?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Oh God, you can find us at videogameoutsiders.com

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Oh, there you go

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Orange Lines Radio

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
All right, all right

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
You know what, I would actually agree

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I named Gears of War at E3

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I said next to Spore, it was the game I was anticipating the most

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Walking out of the doors of E3

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Because when I looked at E3, I thought

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Boy, the cover seems so neat

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
How one button will do all this stuff

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
But then when I actually sat down and played it

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I was like, ugh, I don't like this

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I want to just run out there and start shooting people

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Like Quake or Halo

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
All right, John, what do you think was the best game of 2006?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Well, my favorite game by far this year

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
So far is Zelda for the Wii, Twilight Princess

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Definitely the best single-player game of the year

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
It's just absolutely immersive

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
The art direction, the plot, everything about it

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I just absolutely love, it's what I live for

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
And then my favorite multiplayer game, I agree with Michelle

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000
It's Rainbow Six Vegas with a close second Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Because I think at the end of the day

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
That's the game I probably played the most this year is Ghost Recon

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
All right, interesting

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
All right, so we'll put you down for

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
It sounds like you're very passionate about the Zelda

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
So we'll put that down as the single-player game

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Yes, very much so

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Yeah, I would say so

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Worst game, you want to hear my totem ball?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
What the hell is that?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I wonder when someone was going to go to the Xbox Live

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And some of their questionable picks this year

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
So even though the game was free

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
You still say it's not worth being free

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Yes, it was an embarrassment to Xbox Live

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
You know, what is it about camera games anyway?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Everybody seems to want to do camera games

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
But it seems to me like no one's done it right

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Well the iToy, the Sony iToy was pretty successful though

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
It was successful, but how fun was it really?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I know, exactly

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Fun for like an hour and then it kind of, I don't know, the thrill is lost

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
It's a novelty

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Well hey, best of luck to you guys in 2007

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Tell our listeners really quick who may not be familiar with your program

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Tell them a little bit about your show

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
We have a really stupid podcast

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
No stop

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Basically we have a very relaxed kind of podcast

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
In the atmosphere if you're just kind of talking with your friends

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
We're not game experts, we're not in the industry

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And we have a really great forum and community

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And I think that's what makes our show so great as well

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Yeah, we have awesome listeners

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And there's actually a third host who's not here

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Kyle Jones, and he's Canadian

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Yes, he's our resident Canadian

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
So check us out, videogameoutsiders.com

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
We have a forum, you can download the episodes and all that

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Show archives, blah blah blah

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Videogameoutsiders.com

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Alright, very cool

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Check that out you guys, it's videogameoutsiders.com

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Congratulations to you guys on an awesome 2006

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Thanks for coming on our program tonight

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
We appreciate it

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Thanks for having us

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
And we'll see you in 2007

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Happy New Year

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
We definitely want to thank John and Michelle

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
For coming on from Video Game Outsiders

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
You know, that was one of those people that we contacted

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
We really didn't know them

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
But we just kind of thought we'd get along with them

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Just because, hey, you know, it's two guys and a girl

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
That do their show, and they all met through a gaming community

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And we know some of our listeners are in common

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
So it was very cool of them to come on

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Without really maybe knowing who we were

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I don't know if they knew beforehand or what

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
So it was just very cool

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
And I gotta say, that Michelle, she's got some pretty big balls

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Naming Gears of War the worst game of the year

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Well, I mean, it was kind of a disappointment sometimes

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
But maybe I need to play it more

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I know it's fucking hard, though

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
All my coworkers that bought that game said

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
My God, this game is so fucking hard

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I'm playing it on easy, and I can't fucking pass

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
To the goddamn beginning of the game

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
No, I mean, I can't say I disagree with her

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
I don't know if I would have called it the worst game of the year

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
But definitely one of the biggest disappointments

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
For me, personally

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
You know what, I'm gonna go on the record saying

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I think the best game of next year is gonna be Earth Defense Force 2017

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
What?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
It's the same game, you're fighting giant ants and robots and stuff

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Okay, maybe it's not the best game, but it's a game I want

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Alright, well, thanks again to those guys over at VideoGameOutsiders.com

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
They just released the whole Simple 2000 series over here

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
That'd be fun

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Alright, you're looking at this whole other world right now, Logie

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
So?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
As usual

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Alright, who's our next interview?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Our next one is Brad from PodCulture

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
And I'm joined here by Brad from PodCulture

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Welcome to the program, Brad, how you doing?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Beachy King

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Hey, now this is a little different because PodCulture

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Not exactly exclusively a games podcast

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
But you're still a games fan, yes?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Oh yeah

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
What kind of stuff do you talk about over there on PodCulture for those that don't know?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Basically just geek life

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000
You know, it's me, a friend of mine I've known for I guess almost 20 years now

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And my girlfriend and the three of us just sit around and talk about what TV we're watching

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
What games we're playing, what movies we're watching

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
That kind of stuff

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Sounds just like what we do here, but a little more geeky

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
More in the pop culture business, I guess

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Nothing wrong with that

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Well, thanks for coming on the show today, Brad, and we want to play a little game with you

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And it's called The Year 2006 in Review

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.000
So we have 11 boxes left, why don't you pick one of those boxes, 1 through 11

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
We'll open it up and see what's inside

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Number 9

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Alright, number 9, here we go

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:31.000
The best puzzle game of 2006, are you a big puzzle game fan?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I like some of them, yeah

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Well, did you have a particular favorite that you would call the best puzzle game of 2006?

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Well, I don't know if it came out in 2006, but I started playing it in 2006

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
We'll take it

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Astro Pop

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Astro Pop, I believe technically that was a release this year, so on Xbox Live Arcade

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Yeah

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Interesting choice, because some of those PopCap games, some folks say they don't belong on Xbox Live

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
What is it about the Astro Pop game that you like so much?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Well, I have ADD when it comes to games, so when it comes to trying to play something for a long time

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I kind of lose interest in it a lot

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
So, you know, you can pick that up and just run with it

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
So, Astro Pop is one of those games that you really sit down and you only play it for a little while at a time

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Mm-hmm

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Alright, gotcha, okay, I can understand

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Well, as we say, there are no right or wrong answers, it's your opinion

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
So there you have it, Astro Pop for best puzzle game

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Aren't those achievements a pain in the butt, though, on Xbox Live? I don't think I have any of them

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I haven't gotten any on Astro Pop

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
That's a tough game

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Alright, well, we also want to know your opinion on a particular news topic

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000
And the one we have in box number 9 is the PlayStation 3 line versus the Wii line

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Of course, in November, big, big console launches

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
And you hear about this violent outbreak

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I think there was this comic that put it so well is that there was this violent outbreak going on in the PlayStation 3 lines

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Where people were getting shot and pushed into telephone poles

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
And then you go to the Wii line and it's like people are wearing buttons that say free hugs

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And it's just, you know, kumbaya and everything

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Why do you think there was such the radical difference between the two lines this year?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I don't know if it's just that Nintendo is more of a fun system versus the hardcore gamers on the P3 or what

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I really don't know

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Nintendo has always had more of a fun thing around their system

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000
It's been less hardcore gamers than the PlayStation has been, at least to me anyway

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000
So you think maybe when you say it's more fun, maybe the fact that there were more people in the Wii line

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
That were really dedicated and you knew that those people were going to be playing the Wii

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Versus, you know, the eBaying that they say was going on in the PlayStation 3 line

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Where half those people were camping to put it on eBay

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Yeah, and you're looking at it where the system costs half as much too

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000
More people are going to be able to afford to buy that to play

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And, you know, it's more of a status symbol in a lot of ways

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
You know, I've got a PlayStation 3 that are rare

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
You know, it's hard to get a Wii, sure, but it's a lot harder to get a P3

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I can agree with the status symbol thing

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Because I think the media kind of made it to look like the PlayStation 3 was kind of this, you know, big status symbol

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Especially, you know, when they were covering the lines and everything

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000
So do you think some of that might have to do with the fact that the PlayStation 3 came out first?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
You're only talking a couple of days there, really

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I guess that's true

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
It was, what, a week, maybe a week, a couple of days

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
About like four days, yeah

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I guess that's true

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
All right, well, hey, just out of curiosity, did you end up waiting in line for one of these systems?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.000
No, I've never been a get-it-at-the-moment kind of guy

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.000
It's only been within the past four or six months that I've even got an Xbox 360

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
So you're going to wait this little war out and see what happens, huh?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Yeah, I didn't feel like fighting the crazy lines to get a Wii

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I thought about getting a Wii, but I kind of looked around and then the day they went on sale I had to work anyway

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
And by the time I got off, everybody had sold them all out at the Target

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Do you think if there wasn't all this craziness around the Wii still that you might have one right now?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
If I had 250 bucks, yeah, you betcha I'd have one

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
I guess this is the wrong time of year to be asking right after Christmas

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Oh, yeah

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
All right, well, thanks so much for your opinion

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
We want to get your opinion on a couple more things here real quick

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:43.000
We also want to know, we're taking a poll all night long, what do you believe was the best video game of 2006

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
In your opinion, using whatever criteria you want

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.000
The best video game that I've gotten, and this is kind of weird because it conflicts with my ADDN games

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
But Phantasy Star Universe, I've loved that whole series

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
And I picked that up because I love the Dreamcast version and all that

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And I picked up PSU and I've had a blast with that

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Are you playing more the single player or more the online in that game?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
About 50-50, maybe a little more online

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
This game was a little bit, I think, overlooked

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I agree that Phantasy Star Universe is actually a much better title than I think a lot of people are giving it credit for

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
In my opinion

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I think part of the reason people are overlooking it is because it came out right around the same time that you had Final Fantasy XII

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
A real powerhouse RPG on Sony's PlayStation

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Do you think people are overlooking this game?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Well, as far as I can remember, Phantasy Star hasn't been the big blowout

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Hadn't had the fanboy following maybe that Final Fantasy has

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:56.000
What is it about Phantasy Star Universe that appeals you to that game as opposed to a game like Final Fantasy XII?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Well, having never played any of the Final Fantasy games

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I create my own character, I go through it

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
It doesn't seem to be as complex

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Or at least Phantasy Star Online didn't seem to be as complex

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Now Phantasy Star Universe has a little more depth to it than the other version

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
I can see that

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Where Phantasy Star Universe and Phantasy Star Online especially were a little more action oriented

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
You actually use the weapons, like you press a button to swing the weapon

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Whereas Final Fantasy was always a little more weight, cast magic

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
It was a little more think about it in advance type thing

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Think and then act as opposed to having to react to Phantasy Star Universe

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Exactly

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.000
What would you say would be the worst game that you played in 2006?

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
The worst game

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000
It's weird because it's a fun game but it's the worst controls

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Is Sneak King

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Oh, Sneak King, worst game, why did you say Sneak King?

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Because it's hard as hell to control that damn thing, at least to me

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
So even for four bucks it's too much, you think?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Four bucks is four bucks, that's not that big of a deal

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
But it's hard as hell to just control it

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Do you think it was a little bit of a throwaway title just because of the commercial tie-in

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
That maybe the people who developed it thought, it's a four dollar game

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
We don't need to

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Oh, exactly

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Alright, so I guess the quality showed up there in the end

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Alright, well thank you for sharing your opinion with us there

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
So we got Phantasy Star Universe and Sneak King for best and worst of 2006

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
And we'll tally it up throughout the night and see where we end up

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Brad, what are your plans for 2007 with Pod Culture?

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Just going to kind of keep on doing the same old, same old

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Or any big things coming up for 2007?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
We've tweaked the format a little bit

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
We're starting to go weekly rather than bi-weekly

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
With the show and who knows what lies in the future

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Trying to get the word out and getting some more people listening to the show

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Awesome, well get the word out right now

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Tell them how they can tune into Pod Culture for some more geek and sci-fi chat

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Be over at PodCulture.net

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Alright

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
And there's three or four different ways to subscribe to it

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Got an iTunes link, ODO

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And just the regular RSS feed

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And we're listed on Dig and Pop Current and all that fun stuff

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Alright, go give them a dig, PodCulture.net

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Brad, thanks so much for coming and joining us on the show

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I know you've been a longtime listener of Orange Lounge

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And we appreciate the support

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And we're glad to have you on to support your independent program as well

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Thank you very much

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Especially when you're looking at sales trends and what system is ultimately gonna be victorious

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
It's not going to be just the system that appeals to the hardcore gamer

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
But everybody in between from casual gamer on to maybe a mid-level

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Yeah, I like video games a little bit type thing

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.000
So, big thanks to Brad for coming on and sharing his perspective on the best puzzle game

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
In the PlayStation 3 line and the Wii line

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000
You know what the Wii needs to, what market they need to tap

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Is the old people that go to the casino market

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
And you can get some games that they can actually gamble and win money

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Ah, that's a lot of money right there for you

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
You could actually use the Wii controller to pull a slot on a machine

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Exactly

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I mean, World Series of Poker are tournament champions for the Wiis

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
And they honestly have that game out there

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
And how it uses the controller is beyond me

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:58.000
But I'm thinking there's a lot of people that shuffle into a bus and go to a casino

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
If you can bring that experience home

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
You know, maybe have the Wii puff out some cigarette smoke

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Maybe that's that hidden feature of the Wii no one knows about yet

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
It'll blow smoke in your face

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
You are so strange

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Alright, anyway, we're going to take a little detour here

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Because we're going to bring on some more people in segment B of our show

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000
But first, it would not be an episode of Orange Launch Radio

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
If we did not have our very own Dark Sakura

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Providing us with her perspective

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
From when she surfs up the web, up, down, left

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I mean, that's all she does at work all day, is surf the web

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
So she's finding the website for you

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
What she believes is the website of the week

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week?

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
I blame you for this, Rob

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I blame you for this, it's so hardcore

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.000
This site of the week is one that Rob turned me onto

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
It's the Katerday Live Journal Community

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Which I've been looking over

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
And yeah, I love Katerday

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
The only reason I still really go to 4chan anymore is for Katerday

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
So this one is community.livejournal.com slash Katerday

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
C-A-T-E-U-R-D-A-Y

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And I'm looking at one right now that has a cat with one of those frilly head things

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
And a little wand that says

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Be in your fairy kitty, plot in your death for this

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Fantastic

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
I'm thinking in 2007 we ought to just change the name of the segment to

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Dark Sakura's cat picture site of the week

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
No, no, no

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Because that's all you ever pick

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
No, no, no, no, no, because I also picked Dr. Who's site

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
God forbid they come out with a cat Dr. Who site

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Or Dr. Who gets a little cat companion

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
No, because he doesn't like cats

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Well, what a bastard

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
But I got to say though, in all honesty, you know, you may think

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Jamie's a little weird for her Dr. Who obsession

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000
But she finally did her best to make me a Dr. Who fan this week

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
And it's actually kind of working

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
We've been watching season one and we're, what, like five episodes in

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And I actually really enjoy it

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
It's a really good show

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
It really is good

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
We're actually more than that

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
We're on the third disc

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
So we're on the seventh episode in

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Oh dang

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I'm loving it

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I think it's a great show

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I can't wait to get to season two

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
This is my favorite episode for the first season

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
The Daleks

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Exterminate

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
It was good, it was good

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
They should make a video game out of that

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
They actually have made Dr. Who video games

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Yeah, but like a new one

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Because it's all a, you know, new resurgence of Dr. Who

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
So they need new Dr. Who games, I think

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
We need to shoot the Cybermen the game

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Well, we're getting what?

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I heard we're getting a Battlestar Galactica MMO on 360

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
We're getting, you know, the, what else were they making?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
A Firefly

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
You can't do a Dr. Who MMO

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
It doesn't have to be an MMO

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I don't care if it's an MMO or not

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Make a good, good platformer, good TV tie-in game

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Well, Rob also showed me another show that made me giggle

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
He showed me the BBC Queer as Folk

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Yes, because it was actually written by the same guy who did Dr. Who

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And, well, the new series, anyway

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
And it made me just crack up

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
When the one person watched by teasing one of the main characters

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Going ex-star-men-a

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I was like, yeah

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I have a sonic screwdriver now that I left it at home

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
You know the reason why I love the British version of Queer as Folk

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Is I have a total crush on Vince

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Who is the nerdy, nerdy one there

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I don't like the other guy

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
I know, he's a, he's a

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Do it, do it

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Do it

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Alright, anyway

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
But I gotta say that I like the BBC Queer as Folk more than the American one

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Because it's more compa-

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Like, it was over in, like, eight episodes

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Which is better

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
I've only seen one episode of the US one

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And that was with the lesbians getting married

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Aww, isn't that sweet

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Anyway, before this show gets any gayer

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
We better take a break

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.000
And we'll be back here on Orange Lounge Radio Part B to talk more about the year in review

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Stay tuned, we have Travis Donovan from Travis Donovan Live coming on

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
We have some folks from Destructoid.com

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
We love that blog

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And Gamertag Radio getting some representation up in Part B

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Stay tuned, we'll be back after this

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
