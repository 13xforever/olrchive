Do corporate shuffles at Sony tell us the future of PS3?

Halo 3 releases beta information

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And did Capcom finally list the complaints on small text?

72

You download them, you go, why was I so into this?

73
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Some of the later Bonk titles were good.

74
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah, maybe that's what it is, but the first one was not that great.

75
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
There's just no point, though, because honestly, everything that's on Virtual Console right now, I have.

76
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But isn't it nice to just have it all right there?

77
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I didn't have it to a graphics, I didn't have a Genesis, so...

78
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, half of the fun for me, and this whole reason why I'm not as much into emulators either,

79
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
is because I just like hooking up the system and playing it.

80
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You know, I like the whole having the right controller in my hand, and...

81
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So, if something comes up on the Virtual Console that was really rare that I don't have...

82
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Like, say that they put, oh, a panorama cotton on...

83
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah, good luck. Good luck.

84
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's what I'm saying. You know, then maybe I will download something.

85
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I see. Well, maybe you could start a petition.

86
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I want them to put Guardian Legend on Virtual Console.

87
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Okay, I would download Guardian Legend.

88
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You know what I don't understand is why it's taking them so long to put these super Virtual Console games on there.

89
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I think it's one of those things where they're trying to spread it out to make it look like, hey, new stuff every week.

90
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Kind of like how Microsoft does.

91
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You know, they're sitting on a few arcade games, and they only release the one a week, or whatever.

92
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I imagine they go through the same QA process as most of their other games go through, and all that other stuff.

93
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So, they probably have certification, all that crap.

94
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So, they probably are just testing to make sure the games actually work.

95
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You know, because backwards compatibility issues that you've heard on other systems,

96
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
maybe they're just making sure there's no bugs.

97
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Maybe if you wait long enough between games, you'll buy the crappy ones.

98
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know. Well, my thought, okay, probably when the Metroid game comes out on Wii,

99
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
is when old-school Metroid will be available, and so on.

100
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You know, they're probably going to do little things like that.

101
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But it is very strange.

102
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Where's Excitebike, then?

103
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It is very, yeah, it's true.

104
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It is very strange that Japan's launch is, like, Uber, if you look at their Virtual Console lineup.

105
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I mean, they got Castlevania IV, and, like, a bunch of stuff I would really want.

106
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Like, if they had Castlevania IV on Virtual Console, I'd be buying that shit right now.

107
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Totally.

108
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So...

109
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Which I don't understand.

110
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I mean, like, I have GameTap on the PC, and you can play the first three Castlevanias there, and other stuff.

111
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You know, but I don't know what it is about the TV, and the sound system, and the Wi-

112
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'd love to curl up on the couch and play.

113
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
To be honest, I want the original games.

114
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You know, like, games that they're making specifically for the Virtual Console.

115
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah.

116
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's what I would like to see, instead of this retro stuff, because I really just don't care too much.

117
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And I bought Zelda, I bought Super Mario 64.

118
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Have I played them?

119
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah, like, twice.

120
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And that's it.

121
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm done with them already.

122
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'd do that for some titles.

123
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Like, SimCity, I played once or twice, and that was it.

124
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I bought, like, five Virtual Console games.

125
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I bought SimCity Mario Brothers, which was-

126
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I even- I'm teasing myself.

127
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Rob, you're so stupid for buying Mario Brothers.

128
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's been on, like, every single Game Boy Advance version of Mario,

129
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
but it really is, like, one of my favorite 80s arcade games they ever put out, was the old-school Mario Brothers.

130
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I have a lot of memories of that as a kid, so maybe there's something to be said there.

131
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But I bought those two, I bought Bonk, Zelda, and Sonic.

132
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And I still want to get, like, Golden Axe.

133
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And I'm going, Rob, why not just get that stupid Genesis collection on PS2 instead of buying these Virtual Console games?

134
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I don't know, I can't stop.

135
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's an addiction.

136
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Addict.

137
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Maybe I keep hoping they're going to add multiplayer later on, I don't know.

138
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Well, they said that they're going to be updating the Virtual Console games.

139
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's implied.

140
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't think anyone in Nintendo said that.

141
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's implied from what they're seeing as the options on the Virtual Console.

142
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
When you go in there, you know, you can select the game and there's an option to update the game if there's one available.

143
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So people are implying that, but nothing's been said, as far as I know.

144
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Well, anyway.

145
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Outside of Virtual Console games, Trauma Center, second opinion on Wii.

146
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Now, see, understand I never played the DS1, so this is all new to me.

147
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Graphically, the game is not so hot, but the game itself is so great.

148
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The operation and everything, the Wii is awesome for a game like that, so I'm having fun with that.

149
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And then I've been watching my roommate play Excite Truck.

150
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You guys know Eczema, right?

151
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He is obsessed with Excite Truck.

152
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
In fact, he's playing it now.

153
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He's gotten all the Excite and Super Excite and everything, and he's working on Mirror Mode right now, which I guess is in the game, too.

154
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He's working on getting Mirror Mode.

155
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He's getting S's in Super Excite.

156
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh my gosh, this is crazy.

157
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Like, every time I come home, there's Excite Truck going...

158
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I found a fun peripheral for that.

159
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What?

160
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
They have an actual wheel attachment for the Wiimote.

161
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh, the GT game.

162
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Won't work with Excite Truck.

163
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Really?

164
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah, because you see Excite Truck, you have to keep the controller flat, and then you turn it, you know, so that you tilt it on that axis.

165
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
However, the wheel has it, you know, facing the top of the, you know, basically away the wrong direction.

166
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I think you can, I think that'll work in Excite Truck, though.

167
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I think, because I seem to remember E3, that's how I was playing it.

168
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I have to go back and find that video or picture of me playing E3, but at E3, that's how I was playing it.

169
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Because I thought that's how you were supposed to hold it, was out.

170
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Like, where the, not where the controller's lying flat, but where the controller's facing you, and I think it still worked.

171
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It does a little bit, but not how it's supposed to be.

172
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No wonder I sucked hard at E3.

173
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You could do it like the teacup ride, you know, have it flat down.

174
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But the thing is, that peripheral would suck when it comes to playing the actual game, because you can't really reach the buttons very easily.

175
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

176
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, and to be honest, why would you buy it?

177
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I mean, there was a gimmick to sell those two really, really old games, which have been reviewed very poorly,

178
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and they're just ports of old games, and they're throwing this tacked-on controller because it's neat.

179
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Ooh, you get a steering wheel attachment! Ooh!

180
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And you can actually buy it by itself for $15, which I don't know why you'd want to spend the money for it, but whatever.

181
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Because I just can't imagine this as a steering wheel.

182
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I just need something to, you know, do the imagining for me.

183
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
As far as other games I've been playing, back over to the 360, I have been playing a little bit of Phantasy Star Universe.

184
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I had to check out the new stuff when they added it.

185
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And Burger King games, I actually checked out as well.

186
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You know, they're all stupid, but considering the fact that they cost, you know, kind of less than an arcade game,

187
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't.

188
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I mean, you have to buy the value meal, so the games aren't really four bucks.

189
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The games are like eight bucks with food, you know, type thing.

190
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So, but whatever. It's still a pretty decent value, all things considered.

191
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And, you know, the games, you know, I think Sneak King was my favorite, as I imagine most people.

192
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
All very creepy, though.

193
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And Pocket Bite Racer, not so much. Wasn't feeling that one.

194
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Big Bumpin' is somewhere in the middle.

195
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Big Bumpin' is pretty easy to pick up and go, but...

196
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I hear it's great on live.

197
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I bet, yeah. I might have to check that out on live while I'm stealing your copies of those,

198
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
and try to get some of those achievements and what have you, but...

199
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Super easy achievements for some of them.

200
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Really? I don't know.

201
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Well, you got one from getting stuck on a wall.

202
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I played like two courses on that Pocket Bite Racer before I kind of got fed up with it,

203
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and I already had gotten like 30 points in achievements for doing nothing.

204
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So it was interesting.

205
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm not the achievement point whore you are, though, Logie.

206
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Maybe a little bit.

207
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Let's see, what else?

208
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Lastly, I would say I've been playing Viva Pinata.

209
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I picked up last night.

210
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's interesting.

211
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's not what I thought it would be.

212
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I mean, they told me, you know, it's kind of like The Sims and stuff,

213
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
but I don't know. I had something else pictured in my mind,

214
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
but there's a lot that goes on in that game at once.

215
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't know if it's just because I've been moving pretty fast,

216
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
but if I was a kid, I'd be so lost in that game right now,

217
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I wouldn't be able to keep up with it.

218
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But it seems like things are happening so fast,

219
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and I kind of keep wondering if I'm playing the game right,

220
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
but, you know, I'll just kind of keep at it.

221
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So I'm having fun, and it's kind of cute,

222
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and I like being able to name the creatures

223
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
because I've been giving them all X-rated names

224
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and then watching them do the mating dance or whatever they do.

225
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And there's some cute creatures in there,

226
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and it's definitely better than the cartoon.

227
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The best part was the beginning of the game

228
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
when you first got the shovel,

229
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
and I suggested that we hit the woman that kept talking.

230
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, yeah, the little guy.

231
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah, if you keep whacking her with the shovel,

232
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
she's like, if you do that one more time, you're going to be sorry.

233
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And so I whacked her again with the shovel,

234
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
because there's actually like a little animation,

235
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
like she goes, ah, ah, ah.

236
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Like, don't hit me with the shovel.

237
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And then you hit her enough times just to say,

238
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
if you do that again, you're going to be sorry.

239
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And then she takes away your shovel.

240
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And she casts a little spell, and she takes away your shovel.

241
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And you're kind of screwed.

242
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Like, you have to have a shovel in that game

243
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
to clear places for the house to go.

244
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So I had to like reset completely.

245
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And Matt was just laughing the whole time.

246
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Because it's fun to hit things with shovels.

247
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
There's actually, I hope you don't mind,

248
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
there's one other thing I forgot.

249
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What's that?

250
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The dance playing.

251
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Okay, I'm done pretty much.

252
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That was it.

253
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Bookworm Adventure.

254
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Bookworm Adventure?

255
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

256
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I read stories on the internet about Bookworm Adventure.

257
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Isn't that one of those like casual games,

258
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
like PopCap type games?

259
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's for kids.

260
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah?

261
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But it's funny, because Dan's like,

262
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
this is actually getting challenging.

263
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Well, maybe kids and my coworkers.

264
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Because of tons of people at work,

265
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I walk around and I see them playing, you know,

266
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
whether it be Bejeweled or Zuma or, what's that other one?

267
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I've been playing Bejeweled on my cell phone.

268
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Collapse.

269
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Well, it's funny, while I was putting on my shoes

270
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
to come over this morning,

271
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I was looking at watching Dan play the game,

272
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and it sort of makes me think of sort of like Scrabble almost,

273
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
how you form your words out of the letters you're given.

274
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But Dan's like, I have the XY sword,

275
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
so if I use a word with an X or a Y, I do triple damage.

276
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm like, okay.

277
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Oh, he needs to get xylophone,

278
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
because then he'd have both.

279
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't think there'd be enough letters

280
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
pulled up for xylophone.

281
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Whatever.

282
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But the longer the word you spell

283
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
out of the letters you're given,

284
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
the more damage you do,

285
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and he'd like beat up a lion,

286
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
and it had blood and everything.

287
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Interesting.

288
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Where can you check that out?

289
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Do you know?

290
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I actually do not,

291
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
but I will find out for our listeners next week.

292
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Sounds good.

293
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
All right, a little bit of housekeeping.

294
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
This week will only be a one-part show.

295
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I know you guys are probably really ticked off,

296
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
because we weren't even here last week,

297
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
but I'm out of town tomorrow night on our usual live time,

298
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and because of that, Dark Sakura made other plans,

299
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and I'm sure Loki's going to,

300
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
well, I don't know what he's going to do.

301
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
He'll do something as well.

302
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So, sorry, but we'll be back live next week for sure,

303
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and we'll do some fun stuff.

304
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Maybe we'll do like a giveaway or something

305
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
to make up for us being kind of spotty the past couple weeks.

306
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Oh, sorry, you won't be here next week, will you?

307
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah, I'm going to be at Disneyland.

308
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Well, shoot.

309
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Well, Loki and I will be live,

310
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
and we'll have some type of special guest.

311
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I will call.

312
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay.

313
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I will call.

314
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And give us the report.

315
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yeah.

316
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
All right.

317
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm going to check out the arcade at Disneyland.

318
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We have some website changes coming up,

319
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
just some little minor things.

320
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
We've put some live show status thing on our main website,

321
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
so for those of you guys that keep tabs of our spinoff shows,

322
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
because we do many live shows during the week here

323
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
on Orange Launch Radio,

324
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
you can keep status of what shows are being live this week

325
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and what's in reruns and all that.

326
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You can see that right on the main page.

327
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And our news feed's going to be going through

328
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
some big changes this week as well,

329
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
so stay tuned for that,

330
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
because we haven't been posting a lot on our site lately,

331
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
we realize, so we're trying to change our approach

332
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
to how we're doing website updates,

333
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and we think it's going to be successful.

334
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
We're going to take a lot of the stuff

335
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
that we originally conceptualized for our stuff blog,

336
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and we're going to somewhat dismantle,

337
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I don't want to say dismantle the stuff blog,

338
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
but we're not going to really update the stuff blog anymore,

339
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
because it wasn't really being updated anyway,

340
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
but we're going to take a lot of those ideas

341
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and instead put them on the main website.

342
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So stay tuned to orangelaunchradio.com,

343
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and we hope you like what you see.

344
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Also a lot of new forums coming to our website soon.

345
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You'll see what that's all about pretty soon.

346
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Also, speaking of the live station,

347
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
we had a brand new show debut last week,

348
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
it's called STFU, and it's a gaming show,

349
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and right now it's airing live only on Thursdays

350
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
at 7 o'clock Pacific with DMN and DJ Tyrant,

351
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and I heard the first episode was very well received,

352
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
so check it out.

353
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
We are looking into an audio archive or podcast,

354
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
whatever you want to call it, for that program.

355
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
More to come on that on end of 2007.

356
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
As well as Travis Donovan live is alive and kicking.

357
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
If you're into sci-fi, Travis, Saturday nights at 7,

358
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
good times, good times.

359
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Also, there's other things being worked on for next year,

360
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
so keep an ear, I guess, to your computer speaker

361
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
or whatever you listen to us do.

362
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Absolutely, and if you have an idea for a show,

363
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
if you think you can do better, let's hear it.

364
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Send us an email, and we're open to new suggestions

365
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
for new shows always.

366
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That's how DMN and DJ Tyrant did it.

367
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
We're open to new experiences.

368
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
That's right.

369
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
We're open to experimentation.

370
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
All right, that being said, let's get on into the gaming news.

371
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's been forever.

372
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I have some news.

373
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
All right, Dark Soccer.

374
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
This makes me laugh.

375
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Start us off.

376
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
What's up?

377
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Well, Ken Kutaragi has been moved to CEO of SCEI,

378
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Sony Computer Entertainment.

379
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You mean Crayon Eating Officer?

380
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yes, Crayon Eating Officer.

381
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
He is now the man in charge.

382
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Kaz Hirai is heading over to Tokyo to do the world group,

383
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and the co-CEO of Sony America, Jack Trenton,

384
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
is going to take Kaz Hirai's place

385
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
and is actually going to be the first American

386
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
to hold that position in the company.

387
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So that's actually pretty cool.

388
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But I've seen speculation since I first found the information,

389
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and actually I want to thank our buddy Rob Way

390
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
for sending me some of the first information on it, too.

391
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I think the whole reason they're doing that is,

392
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
well, you done screwed this up.

393
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You go sit in the office and eat some crayons there.

394
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I think that he's got a broader vision, I think,

395
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
or maybe that's what they're thinking.

396
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Well, it's weird because I've seen this story approached in two ways.

397
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I've seen it approached as, oh, this is a downgrade for him.

398
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Even though he's moving to a CEO position,

399
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
he's being moved because the Sony PlayStation 3 launch has been botched.

400
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The PSP is not doing as well as it should have.

401
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But I've also seen it reported as, this is a promotion.

402
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
He's going to be a CEO.

403
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
That's a big title.

404
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It depends.

405
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
How much of a Sony fanboy or a Kudaragi fanboy are you?

406
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That's how you're going to interpret this, I suppose.

407
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Now, I'm going to take this from being that you've been in the same.

408
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
We've all been working for various corporations over our off-radio career.

409
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But looking at this from a very upper management point of view,

410
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I think that they see he's this public figure.

411
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
He's done really good through here as far as they think.

412
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
He could still do a benefit, but his vision is not what we need for this.

413
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
He has ruined this.

414
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
We do not need him on a focused thing.

415
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
We need him on the big picture.

416
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I kind of agree.

417
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I think when something's broken, you fix it,

418
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and I think there is that perception that PlayStation 3 and PSP could be doing better.

419
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Well, it's hard to say.

420
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
PlayStation 3, obviously, it's selling out on shelves, yes,

421
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
but not nearly as many as there should have been.

422
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Certainly, it's made its way into pop culture,

423
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
but I think Sony had hoped to push more out by the end of the year

424
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
than they're realistically going to.

425
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
All this eBay profiteering stuff, whatever.

426
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But since he has done a lot of good for the company previously,

427
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I think they're just doing this shuffle to just try something

428
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and put some new ideas in there.

429
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So I think it's just them trying a different approach.

430
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I don't necessarily think it's good or bad.

431
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's just different.

432
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
They want to go somewhere different.

433
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I've seen similar things happen with the company that I work for.

434
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I've seen people who I just thought were a total botch on their management jobs

435
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
go into VP positions and just soar.

436
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I think as far as anything business related,

437
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
everyone's going to have their talents,

438
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
everyone's going to have their strong points here and there,

439
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and where I still think that Kudaragi is probably a big old stupid, stupid,

440
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
no common sense person, he's there for a reason.

441
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
He's made it as far as he has for a reason.

442
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
PlayStation 2 did kick ass.

443
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And I think that they're trying to save an asset that has proved beneficial to them in the past.

444
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
All right.

445
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Loki, any thoughts on the whole corporate reshuffle?

446
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't know.

447
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Hopefully if putting him in a position that he has more authority, I guess,

448
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
will cause him to shut up more.

449
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It would be most beneficial in Sony's eyes.

450
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
He just needs to shut up.

451
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
If he's good at running the company, great, run the company.

452
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
But just stop having him spout off stupid stuff because he's just...

453
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Well, I think a lot of Sony management in general has been accused of being cocky

454
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and all that other crap through this whole thing.

455
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So I don't see this as one guy's problem

456
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
because the guy in Europe wouldn't shut his mouth either and all this other stuff.

457
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Well, here's what it is to me.

458
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It seems like the higher up you get,

459
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I mean, granted, in the beginning you brought the company to where it needs to be.

460
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You pretty much know your job.

461
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
You know how to do it.

462
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But once you get so high up, you're hands off on a lot of it.

463
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And so you kind of lose face where how stuff actually happens.

464
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And pretty soon you become out of touch with how that company is actually running.

465
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And so you start spouting off crazy shit and it's actually not realistic.

466
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Well, moving on to something that I thought was kind of interesting

467
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
that kind of happened because of this.

468
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This has been spreading like wildfire through blogs.

469
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And you'll see this headline on all these game blogs,

470
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
PlayStation 4 is dead, PlayStation 4 not happening,

471
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
PlayStation 3, Sony's last console.

472
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And it pretty much boils down to this quote coming from Yuta Sakurai,

473
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
who is an analyst at Nomura Holdings, who is talking about all this change.

474
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
He says, the appointment of Sakurai could be a start of shift from hardware to software.

475
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I cannot now imagine a PlayStation 4

476
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
because Sakurai has previously been focused on software at Sony

477
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and so they're reading into this move is that Sony's going to move back into software.

478
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And I can't help but think to myself, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, put the car in park.

479
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
This guy is some analyst for some company.

480
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I don't know why these analyst quotes always seem to make game blogs.

481
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I mean, they're speculating just like any other fan is.

482
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Sure, they get paid to maybe analyze statistics and sales and all that stuff,

483
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
but you guys are gamers.

484
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You know how to analyze this stuff just as easily as these guys get paid the big bucks.

485
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You guys know that it comes down to the good games.

486
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And I'm thinking people are running way too far with this quote.

487
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's way too early to tell if Sony is going to ditch a PlayStation 4.

488
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Come on, PlayStation 3 is still a baby.

489
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
What did they say?

490
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
To go ahead and quote, it was actually their U.S. spokesperson, Dave Cracker,

491
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
is on GameSpot, but I got my information from Eurogamer.

492
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
To quote, following the launch of PlayStation 3 just a few weeks ago

493
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
and witnessing the huge consumer demand for the product,

494
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I think it would be rather short-sighted for anyone to predict

495
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
there might not be a next generation of PlayStation product.

496
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Wow, that's one of the first smart things that Sony said in a long time.

497
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I wouldn't exactly say huge demand. Okay, great.

498
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You sold out of all the units that you produced.

499
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Hooray for you.

500
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
What do you call the eBay profiteering?

501
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Because they know that it's not based on Sony's product being uber great.

502
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It's because, oh, look, I made lots of money on the 360 last year.

503
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Look, there's a similar situation where there's not going to be enough consoles

504
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and people want them, so we're going to sell them for a lot of money.

505
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
People are spending a buttload of money on those PlayStation 3s, though.

506
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
That's the demand they're talking about.

507
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Because little Billy whines and wants, I want my PlayStation 3,

508
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
and then little Billy's parents will buy it.

509
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Well, little Billy should go do the dishes.

510
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Well, Hooray also was bringing up the PS4 himself,

511
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
talking about future plans,

512
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
and there was also discussion about them going into an electronic distribution

513
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
for games in the future.

514
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm sorry, but they should not even be talking PlayStation 4 right now.

515
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Make the PlayStation 3 work first.

516
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Focus on, you know, maybe they do need to put a guy on the software side there.

517
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Put out some better software for PlayStation 3.

518
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
What's the number one complaint been about this launch?

519
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Their launch titles blow, except for maybe Resistance.

520
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
However, and I'm trying to see it from their point of view, too,

521
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
if they don't start thinking about the next generation of system now,

522
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
everybody else is going to be ahead of them.

523
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Thinking about it and talking about it are two different things.

524
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah, but granted, though, this console is supposed to have a 10-year life cycle,

525
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
whereas the other ones are only five years.

526
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So why are they concerned about the console now?

527
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Are they going back on their word again?

528
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I mean, woo, that'd be a shocker.

529
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But really, if you're going to believe that there's going to be no PlayStation 4

530
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
when Microsoft announces the next Xbox,

531
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
they're definitely going to announce the next PlayStation.

532
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Bingo.

533
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I think that it actually,

534
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I think the focus should be on the current system now that it's out,

535
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
but I think that it's still good,

536
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
because as long as you've got the money to pay for the team of specialists,

537
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
then do it.

538
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You have your little team of specialists that are working away on it,

539
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
but they're in a closed room that we don't talk about,

540
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
because for me, if they were to come out and say,

541
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
oh, we've already got this PlayStation 4 thing in the works,

542
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
to me that's them saying, oh, well, the PlayStation 3 is fucked.

543
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And I'm just going to say, well, I guess I ain't going to get one

544
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
because they're already working on 4.

545
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Remember the Gizmondo?

546
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Oh, yeah, by the way, even though our Gizmondo hasn't launched yet,

547
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
we've got the widescreen version in the works,

548
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
so it has to be like announcing the DS Lite when the DS comes out.

549
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Or my question is, how come Nintendo gets away with this shit?

550
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Because they just announced the Wii DVD thing,

551
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
but again, it's not a big deal.

552
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
It's going to be more expensive than who gives a shit.

553
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's like saying, oh, look, it plays CDs now.

554
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Oh, goody, let me go run out and get another CD player.

555
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Oh, wait, no, I don't need one because I have 60,000 of them.

556
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
We also know Wiis are going to come out in different colors at some point

557
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
depending on what we saw at E3.

558
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You get them in different colors now.

559
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
They have sites that will do custom paint jams and things like that.

560
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
That's different.

561
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm talking about officially licensed Nintendo pink Wiis.

562
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh, big deal.

563
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You want a pink Wii?

564
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yes.

565
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Are you going to play with it?

566
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Is that so wrong?

567
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Yes, that's actually very wrong.

568
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I just think it's interesting.

569
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Even better if you get a Bluey.

570
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's just interesting.

571
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Nintendo gets away with things sometimes

572
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
that other people are critical of other companies about,

573
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
and it's fascinating to me.

574
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And even I'm guilty of it, too.

575
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
But because they're Nintendo, we let them get away with it.

576
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I don't know.

577
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Well, it comes down to games.

578
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It comes down to games.

579
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But, you know, Sony's always going back on their word and stuff,

580
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and even now they're still insisting that they're going to ship

581
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
one million PlayStation 3 consoles by the end of this year.

582
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Well, you know what?

583
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I don't think so.

584
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I mean, even Electronic Arts' Larry Prose was basically telling

585
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Reuters that they only shipped out about 200,000 units,

586
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
if that, on the initial launch for the United States,

587
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
even though they were saying,

588
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
oh, yeah, we're going to have half a million units

589
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
or 600,000 units.

590
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah, they didn't really meet those numbers,

591
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and kind of speculating on that,

592
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
they're probably only going to hit about half a million

593
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
to 800,000 by the end of the year.

594
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Makes sense to me.

595
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I mean, they've already underestimated

596
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
or overestimated the amount of units

597
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
that are going to be out there,

598
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and I just don't think they can produce them fast enough,

599
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
especially if they start running into problems like

600
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Microsoft had with, you know, units overheating

601
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
or, you know, some sort of hardware glitch.

602
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
AKA, be very careful about the first batch of any new console.

603
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Well, given the run of first batch PlayStation 2s,

604
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
the just massive amounts of problems that they had,

605
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
on top of that, I think one of the big problems with the PS2

606
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
is that it was not really meant to be used as a primary DVD player,

607
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
which a lot of people were getting it for,

608
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
and the systems would burn out, the first models.

609
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm actually still surprised that my first model Japanese one still works.

610
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Well, yeah, I mean, what's also good, though,

611
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
is Nintendo is still saying that they're ahead of schedule,

612
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and they're going to be shipping out the units that they promised,

613
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
so that's good.

614
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
At least those launches, I know in Japan,

615
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
certainly weren't delayed,

616
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and they had enough units out there, so, you know,

617
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I think what it comes down to is UK is, you know,

618
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
patiently waiting and saying,

619
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
okay, are we actually going to get our launch in March?

620
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I mean, when we do have a launch,

621
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
exactly how many units is a launch?

622
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I mean, here's your one unit.

623
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Please share.

624
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I don't know, I, you know,

625
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
we have a lot of folks over in the UK who listen to us,

626
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and of course we're thankful for that,

627
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and appreciate that you guys listen to us.

628
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I can't help but think, you know,

629
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
you guys really aren't missing that much.

630
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You're really not.

631
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I understand.

632
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Maybe you want the cheap Blu-ray player or whatever it is,

633
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
but, you know, I don't have one either right now.

634
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't even really want one.

635
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Does a European listener maybe want to send me money?

636
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I'll buy you one here and send you one.

637
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
No, you can't even get them here.

638
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I wouldn't be able to do that.

639
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You can't ship them either.

640
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Yeah, because of the lockdown.

641
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Oh, geez.

642
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Enclosed.

643
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Form and grill.

644
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Geez, geez, geez.

645
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Put it in a form and grill box.

646
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
What you need to do is you need to ship it to another country,

647
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
and in that country, someone there has to, you know,

648
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
pretty much walk across.

649
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It's not worth it.

650
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's not.

651
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Is resistance that good, Jamie?

652
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Is resistance that good?

653
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
No, not really.

654
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Then there you go.

655
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
It's not worth it.

656
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Just buy Call of Duty 3 and the 360.

657
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's about the same.

658
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Resistance is pretty, and I do like shooting things in the head,

659
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
but I can shoot things in the head in other games,

660
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
like Resident Evil 4.

661
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Shoot them in the head.

662
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
All right.

663
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
This ain't a cut scene.

664
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Press A.

665
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
If I press A, it'll type over our show thing.

666
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Anyway, so remember how all the fun that we were talking about,

667
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Gran Turismo HD, and how it was just a big, you know, blown up,

668
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
you know, HD version of Gran Turismo 4?

669
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And how the people looked like cardboard cutouts.

670
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
How the game was going to cost $700 after you bought all the cars.

671
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Well, it's actually going to be a free demo now at the PlayStation store.

672
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It'll be out so far only for Japan.

673
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Be out on the 24th of December.

674
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Gran Turismo HD concept.

675
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It will have ten cars, two layouts of a single track,

676
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
at least according to what Yamauchi said, the designer.

677
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It has Time Attack, Drift Trial, Network Ranking,

678
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and they're also, I think, putting more focus, though,

679
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
on GT5 when it's out, which is actually slated for 2008.

680
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Not bad for free, though.

681
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
That's a nice price reduction from, you know, $900 or whatever

682
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
we were joking about to free.

683
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Yay for Sony. Good job.

684
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I think someone finally stepped in, you know, like an analyst or something,

685
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
one of the guys that they have working for the company,

686
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and they go, you actually think this is going to work?

687
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Because this is not going to work.

688
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
The Internet hates you right now.

689
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Maybe you need to try something different.

690
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Yeah, but here's the thing, though.

691
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
We're not certain, though, what Gran Turismo 5 is going to be,

692
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and they could very well do something like this,

693
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
you know, kind of meeting in the middle ground

694
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and having, you know, a decent amount of cars,

695
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
you know, say like, I don't know, 60 or something,

696
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
and you still have to buy 500 other cars online.

697
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So we don't know about that yet, but, I mean,

698
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
when you're advertising the game as a tech demo on E3,

699
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
and then you're all, oh, by the way, it's not a tech demo, that's a full game,

700
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and we want you to buy it for 50 bucks.

701
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Oh, by the way, it doesn't come with any cars.

702
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I'm sorry, that's just, that's their same logic as saying,

703
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
oh, you'd buy a Sony PlayStation 3 if there weren't any games.

704
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I think PR just kind of botched the project.

705
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I agree with the concept that, you know what, just make Gran Turismo 5.

706
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Shut up and make 5.

707
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
All right, anyway, we don't know if that'll be coming to the U.S. yet, do we?

708
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I don't know. I just said Japan only right now, but I would suspect so.

709
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Yeah, make sense.

710
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I would kind of hope so, because I think it actually would be a nice apology.

711
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Something, now, you know it would be...

712
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
We're sorry, here's a game.

713
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
You want to talk about a Geometry Wars killer for the online?

714
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I mean, that's not a bad deal.

715
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
There's a lot of racing game fans who'd get a kick out of that, so maybe.

716
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Anyway, let's talk about what you can get over the counter in Japan pretty soon

717
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
with some Japanese release dates coming out on the Xbox 360 on December 7th.

718
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Blue Dragon, which is a big, big, big title for Japan,

719
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
and so it'll be interesting to see how the game does

720
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
and how many systems are sold in the next week.

721
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It'll be kind of interesting to see what effect that has on Japan.

722
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, not a lot.

723
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You don't really get any more games until you get Armored Core 4 on the 14th.

724
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Same thing with the Wii.

725
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Since you guys just had your system launch this week,

726
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
you're not going to get a whole lot of new titles until, again, December 14th

727
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
when you get Pokemon Battle Revolution

728
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and the Japanese version of Rayman Raving Rabbids.

729
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
But if you're a PS2 fan still, you got a lot of games coming out.

730
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You got Devil Summoner is coming out,

731
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Ace Combat Zero both on the 7th,

732
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Suikoden 5, Gensou Suikoden 5,

733
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
as well as Momotaru Densetsu 16 from Hudson,

734
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and Taiko no Tatujin for our music game fans.

735
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
That's coming out.

736
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Taiko no Tatujin Bang Tap, Tomori 7 Daimei,

737
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
both a drum controller version and the standalone version coming out.

738
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And if you're a Tomb Raider fan in Japan,

739
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Tomb Raider Legend on the PlayStation 2 on December 7th as well.

740
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
If you are a Nintendo DS person,

741
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
there's quite a few games also coming out over there on December 7th.

742
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Several games from Media Works called DS Dendeki Bunko,

743
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
which I'm guessing might be a translation of the dice game.

744
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I have no idea.

745
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Also, DS Puzzler coming from TDK Media Active,

746
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and Cinema Roll.

747
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Hey, that's Sanrio.

748
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Yeah, coming from Bandai.

749
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Is it the same one?

750
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Oh, it sure is.

751
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Yeah.

752
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So check out that one.

753
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I don't have any silly title games this week,

754
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
but I like Cinema Roll,

755
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
so maybe that'll be my must-checkout title of the week.

756
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Hey, if you're a PSP fan,

757
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Mahjong and Parappa the Rappa this week, December 7th.

758
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Hell yeah.

759
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
That's right.

760
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Check that out.

761
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You gotta believe.

762
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
We have two Cinema Roll...

763
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Was it Pillows?

764
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Remember the...

765
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Oh yeah.

766
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Went to the Sanrio outlet.

767
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Yeah?

768
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I need more Batsumaru stuff.

769
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I want the Batsumaru guitar so bad.

770
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So bad.

771
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
All right.

772
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Anyway...

773
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Actually...

774
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Whatever.

775
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
We don't want to turn into Sanrio.

776
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I think the Batsumaru one is a bass, though.

777
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Anyways...

778
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So...

779
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Sorry, guys.

780
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I was busy playing Hello Kitty World.

781
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Anyways...

782
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So, to start off, of course, our release dates.

783
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
We've got some stuff that you might not have heard about yet,

784
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
including some dates for some brand new Wii titles.

785
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Mario Party 8 for the Wii, coming out March 6th.

786
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Has that even been announced that Mario Party's in the...

787
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I mean...

788
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Duh, but...

789
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Yeah, there's been video...

790
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Okay, that's good.

791
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Either...

792
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I can't remember.

793
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Space World or Tokyo Game Show.

794
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I don't remember.

795
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I've never seen it, though.

796
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Wario Master of Disguise for the DS,

797
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
also coming out on the 6th of March.

798
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Wii Plays coming through the United States on the 21st of January,

799
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
including the bundle with the remote.

800
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Actually, it is only bundled with the remote.

801
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
There's going to be some stuff coming out...

802
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Actually, a new Spyro game is in the works right now.

803
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Still working titles.

804
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Spyro 2007.

805
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Obviously, it's not going to be Spyro 2007.

806
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Spyro Ultimate!

807
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It's coming out on August 15th of next year.

808
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It's going to be on PlayStation 2, the Wii, DS, Game Boy Advance, and PSP.

809
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
This one, I hope, is the working title.

810
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Crash Jackin' 07.

811
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
That's for PlayStation 2, the 360.

812
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Wii, DS, Game Boy Advance, and PSP also come out on August 15th.

813
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Mommy, for my birthday, I want Crash Jackin' on the Wii.

814
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,000
What's funny is Blazing Angels for the Wii has been delayed to March 14th of next year.

815
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,000
To coincide with the Blazing Angels 2 release on the 360, which is also the same day.

816
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It's very strange.

817
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Of course, this next week, we've got some good stuff coming out.

818
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
For the Wii, we have Ice Age 2.

819
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I said good stuff, so that's not exactly counted in there.

820
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:54,000
But we do have Far Cry Instinct's Vengeance, I believe, is coming out on the Wii as well.

821
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
That one actually, I heard, is pretty good. It has a good control system in that.

822
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So, if you were jaded by Red Steel, you might want to pick that one up instead.

823
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And then, of course, on the 360, we've got Star Trek Legacy, which is going to be pretty good.

824
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And Rapala Trophies, which is not going to be very good at all.

825
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And on PlayStation 2, one of the only games coming out on PlayStation 2 for December,

826
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Rayman's Raving Rabbids, finally.

827
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So, if you don't have a Wii, that's definitely one to pick up.

828
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
On PSP, though, you've got some good stuff.

829
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Of course, you've got Brothers in Arms D-Day.

830
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And also, on the PlayStation 3, Full Auto 2, which is basically Full Auto 1 with Deathmatch.

831
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And Fight Night Round 3, which is basically Fight Night Round 3 with first-person mode.

832
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm kind of curious about the Star Trek game.

833
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I liked what I saw at E3.

834
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm not usually a tactical games-type person, but I am a little bit of a Trekkie.

835
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I liked the whole Borg ship.

836
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Well, I liked how they re-enacted the Erathicon thing.

837
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
That was kind of rad.

838
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That was fabulous.

839
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I'm tempted to check it out.

840
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
The PSP also is getting Star Wars Lethal Alliance, which is that kind of original game for PSP.

841
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So, it's kind of a smorgasbord of stuff to lead for November.

842
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Well, in UK gaming news, actually a bunch of games already came out, but we weren't live to cover it.

843
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So, I'll just go quickly over that list.

844
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Sonic Rivals came out, a couple football manager games.

845
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, Viva Pinata, Yoshi's Island.

846
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Today being the second, actually.

847
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Tokobot Plus, Mysteries of the Katakuri came out.

848
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Coming out on the 8th, though, we have Wii Launch.

849
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So, get your Wii.

850
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, and then give me your friend code.

851
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So, coming out, we have Barnyard.

852
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
We have Brothers in Arms D-Day, Call of Duty 3, Cars, Dead or Alive Xtreme 2.

853
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Get that as well.

854
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:00,000
EA Replay goes to Recon Advanced Warfighter with more acronyms.

855
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Hey, if you guys in the UK are camping out for a Wii, send us some audio.

856
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Talk to some people in line and send us some audio.

857
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
We want to hear from some of the other countries' launches,

858
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
because we played some audio in our last live episode.

859
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Chris out there at Target interviewing some folks.

860
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I want to hear from some UK people.

861
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
So, I know we've got some listeners out there.

862
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Send me a cassette tape if you have to,

863
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
but make an MP3 somehow and send it to us.

864
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I want to hear from some British folks that are excited about the launch.

865
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Seriously, just take it out,

866
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
and then even if you have to Skype it to us through your computer,

867
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
you can do that, too.

868
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah, you can always call the voicemail, 877-GAME-OLR.

869
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Oh, that's not toll-free in Europe, though, sorry.

870
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
That's why I'm saying take it home and play it through your Skype.

871
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
There you go, there you go.

872
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You can do audio feed through your Skype.

873
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
That's true, that's true.

874
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Also, though, we have King of Fighters XI.

875
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
If that's the 3D one, I don't know.

876
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
GT Pro Series, Madden 2007, like anyone cares.

877
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Monster 4x4 World Circuit, Need for Speed Carbon, Open Season,

878
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Rampage Total Destruction, Rayman Raving Rabbids for a bunch of stuff,

879
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Red Steel, Star Trek Legacy,

880
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
sorry, tongue tied.

881
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Star Wars Lethal Alliance, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz,

882
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Superman Returns a Video Game,

883
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, which is very fun,

884
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam,

885
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
which I'm probably, I think, one of five people that likes that game.

886
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Wii Play, Wii Sports, because, of course, it's the Wii.

887
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And in other notables later on this month is Far Cry Vengeance Sims 2 Pets,

888
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
which is actually kind of fun because your pets are on crack.

889
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Actually, Marvel Ultimate Alliance already came out, too, on, I think, PS2.

890
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
On PSP, I'm sorry.

891
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And that's really it.

892
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And also, just to go ahead and make a mention,

893
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I am going to try to be focusing at least once a month

894
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
on some of the other countries that have different release dates.

895
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
So if there's any place in particular that you've found as a reliable source

896
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
for release dates internationally, let me know.

897
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Send me an email, jamieatorangeholdradio.com.

898
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Sounds good. And that was kind of inspired by our listener email, wasn't it?

899
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It was, which I will be addressing later.

900
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Oh, okay. Then I won't spoil that.

901
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Let's go on back to some news then.

902
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Let's talk about some things happening here stateside.

903
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Very interesting news report coming out of Chicago.

904
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
The Better Business Bureau is challenging Toys R Us

905
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
based on what happened at the Wii launch.

906
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
They were forcing people to buy bundles, essentially what was happening.

907
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Now, keep in mind, this is not nationwide.

908
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
This was a particular store in the area that got a lot of heat for this

909
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
because I know at other Toys R Uss across the country this wasn't a problem.

910
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Very similar to what happened with Best Buy in the 360.

911
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Remember how Best Buys in the Northwest were forcing the bundles?

912
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Well, Toys R Us was forcing, I believe, the Wii,

913
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
three games and their warranty thing they had to buy.

914
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And this one lady was mad and was arguing with the manager about it,

915
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
and the Wii sold out while they were arguing about it.

916
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
She was pissed.

917
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
She did one of those consumer call the news things,

918
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
and now the Better Business Bureau is investigating it.

919
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And I say good.

920
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I agree.

921
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I think companies need to be aware that we're not going to tolerate that bullshit bundling stuff.

922
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I don't want your stupid warranty.

923
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
If somebody does, great, they can purchase that.

924
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
You can offer it to me and I can say no, but don't force me to buy it.

925
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
That's messed up.

926
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And the games and all that crap, I say good.

927
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And this isn't necessarily something against Toys R Us

928
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
because in my mind, reading this story,

929
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,000
this sounds like one manager's or district manager's very piss poor decision

930
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
that's going to screw the company as a whole thanks to that.

931
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So I will take great satisfaction in knowing that thanks to this,

932
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
that manager or district manager will probably be canned because of this.

933
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And I hope it will be a lesson for other managers and district managers nationwide.

934
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Don't try to use these big console launches,

935
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
not that there's going to be another one for quite some time,

936
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
but in the future, don't use these big console launches and the consumer demand for them to sell your crap.

937
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Force us to buy your crap.

938
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
So, any other thoughts on that, Loki?

939
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I understand why they did it, but the bait and switch part's not good.

940
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
The bundling's okay, bait and switch's not good.

941
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Do you think it's okay to force people to buy those bundles?

942
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Yeah.

943
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I don't think so.

944
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I think it's perfectly fine to do.

945
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Why?

946
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Because if you saw what the margins were on the systems and the accessories and the games,

947
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
you would understand why they have to because Nintendo's saying,

948
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
oh, by the way, all that profit that you want, I ain't going to get it.

949
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
You're going to get a dollar.

950
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
But don't you think that logically people are going to buy the games with the system

951
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
or they're going to buy stuff and if they have a good experience with it about the system,

952
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
they'll buy their games there?

953
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
It's about the return business, you know what I mean?

954
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
If they're going to buy a PlayStation 3 for $2,000 on eBay,

955
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,000
what the hell is going to stop me from selling a PlayStation 3 in a retail store with three games attached to it?

956
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You're going to buy it.

957
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Our target, I don't know if it's just our target or if all of them were doing it.

958
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I think it was a national thing.

959
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
They handled it very well.

960
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Instead of forcing somebody into something, because remember,

961
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
it's the same thing from when you're a little kid.

962
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
You want to do other than what you're being made to do, you know?

963
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
That's the biggest part of it is you tell me I have to and I'm like,

964
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
nuh-uh, I don't have to do shit.

965
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I don't have to do shit.

966
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I'm gonna.

967
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Who the hell are you to tell me what I have to do?

968
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Well, the way Target did it, which I was actually very, very, very pleased with this,

969
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
is they gave you an incentive.

970
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
And true, it wasn't like much of an incentive.

971
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
You get a flashy thing that gives you...

972
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Hey, I still have mine.

973
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It's pretty.

974
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
It is pretty.

975
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Look at that.

976
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Ooh, it glows blue.

977
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I can go get one right now.

978
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Yeah, Miklotov bought 15 of these with a dollar each on the card.

979
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
They're these little gift cards that glow blue.

980
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I hope you international folks get something similar.

981
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I don't know if they even have Target internationally, but they're so pretty.

982
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I was gonna get one just to have one, you know?

983
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You know what, if they don't do this internationally,

984
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
maybe I'll send this one to one of our international listeners,

985
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
because they're pretty.

986
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
They're very pretty.

987
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Yeah, it's awfully cool that they glow blue there,

988
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
even though the console doesn't seem to.

989
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Yes, it does.

990
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
When do you get new mail?

991
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Only when I get new mail.

992
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Oh, when it runs updates.

993
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Do you want me to send you mail, Loki?

994
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
No, I can get mail myself.

995
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
But I'm just saying, I want to glow blue all the time.

996
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It can pulse blue when I have mail.

997
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
You're picky.

998
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Well, at any rate, I think that we should pick up a couple of them

999
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
and send some to our overseas listeners if they don't get them.

1000
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Yeah, I don't know if Target's overseas or what,

1001
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
so send some emails if you really want it.

1002
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
We'll see what we can do.

1003
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Yeah.

1004
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
All right.

1005
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
With the launches, of course, there's still lots of desire,

1006
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
especially from the Wii.

1007
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Lots of things that we wish they would have done that they didn't do.

1008
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
For example, and this is actually...

1009
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Whose list is this?

1010
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
This isn't my list.

1011
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
This is Game Informer's list.

1012
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Okay.

1013
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
But I do agree with a lot of it, and a lot of it I do agree with.

1014
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Like, for example, accessories component and S-Video cables.

1015
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Where are they?

1016
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
They certainly are sold out and can't seem to find anywhere,

1017
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
so that kind of sucks.

1018
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
More virtual console downloads, because, I mean, you know,

1019
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
12 games is great, but it's not enough.

1020
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
A wireless sensor bar might be nice, especially if you have a projection TV.

1021
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
The ability to save GameCube saves to the flash memory cards or SD cards

1022
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:30,000
might be good, especially if you're renting games or never had GameCube stuff.

1023
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Better straps for the wireless Wiimotes.

1024
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Now, I think that's just stupid people letting the controllers go,

1025
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
whatever, but I guess they could be stronger.

1026
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
More user-friendly friends list, and I could definitely agree with that.

1027
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,000
A wireless classic controller, so it doesn't have to be tethered to the remote there.

1028
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And, of course, you know, redesign the Wavebird,

1029
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
which I don't really understand that part of it, but okay.

1030
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I think they're saying they want, like, a GameCube controller.

1031
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah, I think they want it more like the classic controller.

1032
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
More robust Wiimotes sensor bar calibration, like Zelda,

1033
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
and that was their example, because I guess you can actually set where the bar is,

1034
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
which is kind of neat.

1035
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
A music channel, which I'm surprised they didn't have it.

1036
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I mean, a picture channel I don't really get either, but a music channel would...

1037
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I've actually been able to use picture channel,

1038
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
because my phone saves to the micro-SDs, and I have a converter,

1039
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
so I put the SD card in there, and that's how I sent some pictures.

1040
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Didn't I send you and Nelly, like, a picture that I doctored?

1041
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Yeah.

1042
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
A picture I took of a stripper, and I drew, like, a fart cloud coming out.

1043
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
It was really immature, but it was funny when I sent it.

1044
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Yeah, but actually I heard that it'll grab stuff off of Bluetooth,

1045
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
so if your phone's Bluetooth, it'll grab it off of there.

1046
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
The Bluetooth on my phone's weird.

1047
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Okay.

1048
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Anyways, points leftovers, because the Wii points,

1049
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
you have to buy them in $10 increments,

1050
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
and so when you buy something, you're left over some excess points.

1051
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Then the 360 guilty of the same thing.

1052
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Yeah.

1053
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Whatever.

1054
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Anyways, online services...

1055
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I guess that's one thing Sony's doing right,

1056
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
is that they're using real cash, none of the stupid Sony points stuff,

1057
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
you know, good for them.

1058
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Online service experience, I guess,

1059
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
you know, there's a lot of trouble connecting to the shops and stuff.

1060
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Optical audio out, and I guess I can understand that,

1061
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
because Prologic 2 is okay.

1062
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Wireless nunchuck, I don't think so.

1063
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
That's another thing that people are going to throw through a window.

1064
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Let's see.

1065
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Boy, this is a bitch list, isn't it?

1066
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
It is a bitch list.

1067
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Better fleshed out accomplishments list,

1068
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
because, you know, I guess play history is just not really an accomplishment.

1069
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
More control over the blue slot illumination.

1070
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I definitely agree with that one.

1071
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Rechargeable battery packs.

1072
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I agree with the achievement thing.

1073
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I can't believe no one copied Microsoft on that whole thing.

1074
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I think it's cute.

1075
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I wish they would have done something like that.

1076
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
And what was I going to say?

1077
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
The battery packs, I think, are coming,

1078
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
because if you look inside of it,

1079
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
there's actually like a contact where they could have a wireless,

1080
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
like a battery pack for it.

1081
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
So that might be something that's on its way.

1082
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Better speakers in the Wiimote, because they suck,

1083
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
and I'm actually thinking about taking one apart to replace a speaker in it.

1084
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
You're weird.

1085
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
We may see that on a future show.

1086
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Save games in the Wiimote, which might be cool.

1087
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
More customization for the Wii menu.

1088
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Game Boy Player, timed demos for every virtual console game,

1089
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
because a lot of these games I haven't played,

1090
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
so I don't know if they're crap.

1091
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Okay, this is turning into just like every little thing that they can think of,

1092
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
you know, they're putting on here that, you know, I don't know.

1093
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Probably not as if they haven't already thought of it themselves.

1094
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I know, this is getting to be a little much.

1095
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Wii Sports in a case, because they got it in a case in...

1096
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I could agree with that.

1097
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Australia.

1098
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
But that is, you know...

1099
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
No ethernet port, which is kind of lame.

1100
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And this doesn't even have anything to do with it.

1101
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Club Nintendo for the U.S.

1102
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Well, it's cool.

1103
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
They get the, like, you know, the points and stuff,

1104
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
like the DS, was it those games and stuff.

1105
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
How hard would it really be for Nintendo to go back and add some of the stuff, though?

1106
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
They have built the updates to be pretty easy.

1107
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
They could add the music channel if they wanted.

1108
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah, and who says it's not coming later on?

1109
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I mean, they said that there's a bunch of surprises,

1110
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
and we'll see some in the next few weeks.

1111
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
All right.

1112
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
It's not hard.

1113
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Oh, we'll see.

1114
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
You know what I want?

1115
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
What?

1116
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I want freaking region free, but no.

1117
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Yeah, they've confirmed it is region locked, the Wii is.

1118
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
So...

1119
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
We cry, we cry, and then we import.

1120
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Until they make a swap.

1121
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Merely a small obstacle for now.

1122
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Now, I heard somebody claim that you can use a boot disk,

1123
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
but then I heard another blogger refute that, so...

1124
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You can for GameCube games.

1125
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
For some games.

1126
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
They're saying that, yeah, it doesn't always work.

1127
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I actually, they were saying with an action replay that I have a freeloader,

1128
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
so when I get home, I'll try it with my freeloader.

1129
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
See if it works.

1130
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
All right.

1131
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
We'll see.

1132
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Speaking of things being locked away,

1133
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
there was an update to the Wii console this week,

1134
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
and a lot of people were very excited because they were like,

1135
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
ooh, maybe I'll have a forecast channel or a news channel to play with,

1136
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
or maybe they fixed some of the HD issues or whatever.

1137
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
But no, really all the update did was that, you know,

1138
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
it said it updated parental controls,

1139
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
and then it locked out that whole thing

1140
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
where people were going into the shop channel

1141
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
and turning it into a browser, which was kind of pointless

1142
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
because you couldn't do much with the browser,

1143
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
but I think it was just one more of those things

1144
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
where somebody wanted to be able to do it to say they did it.

1145
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Well, Nintendo put the smackdown on that.

1146
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
You could do it, and they're still working on a way around that, so...

1147
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
It's turning into the PSP now.

1148
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
How can we hack away their little, you know,

1149
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
and then they'll update, and then, you know,

1150
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
somebody finds another hack to get what they want,

1151
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
and then they'll update.

1152
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
There's PSP all over again.

1153
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
It's still going on, so, you know, sooner or later.

1154
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And also the other thing, too,

1155
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
is people were able to download virtual console games off of a server,

1156
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
so all they have to do is figure out how to encode them

1157
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
and you'd be pirating games off of their servers.

1158
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Oh, interesting.

1159
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
So, yeah.

1160
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
That's probably another reason why they wanted to fix that.

1161
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Yeah, Nintendo may be already looking into making sure that doesn't happen.

1162
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
We'll see.

1163
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Didn't they change, like,

1164
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
because you could browse the virtual console stuff on the web,

1165
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
but then they changed that where now it's all certificate-based

1166
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
or something like that?

1167
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Yeah, it's all certificate-based,

1168
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
and now it checks the IP instead of just the URL,

1169
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
but I think people are going to find ways around that.

1170
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
It's just a matter of time.

1171
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
That's really what it is.

1172
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Now, speaking of updates to the virtual console,

1173
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
there are going to be some more games coming out on Monday here,

1174
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
and some good stuff.

1175
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Donkey Kong Jr. for the NES is going to be making its way out there,

1176
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
and then on the Genesis we've got Columns, Rizstar,

1177
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
and Victory Run for, I believe, the TurboGrafx-16.

1178
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
So, not too bad.

1179
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I don't know.

1180
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I want some more games like...

1181
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Rizstar was Saturn, wasn't it?

1182
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
No.

1183
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
No, that was...

1184
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Think of another game.

1185
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Sorry.

1186
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
It was Genesis.

1187
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Anyways, I want my Super Mario Brothers, God damn it.

1188
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I want Super Mario World, and I want Kid Icarus.

1189
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I want Kid Icarus so bad.

1190
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I want it so bad.

1191
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I hope that's the one game they're like,

1192
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
oh, by the way, for some reason this just wouldn't work with the virtual console.

1193
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I will poke Reggie in the eye myself

1194
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
if they can't get Kid Icarus working on the Wii virtual console.

1195
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I will drive up to Redman and poke him in the eye.

1196
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I want them to emulate Turbo Duo,

1197
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
because I want Dracula X.

1198
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Dream On.

1199
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
No offense, but, I mean, do you think that's high on their priority list right now?

1200
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I know it should be.

1201
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
No, but it would be very easy.

1202
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It's a freaking Super Nintendo game with real audio, is what it is.

1203
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I mean, seriously.

1204
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
But, yeah.

1205
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
That would be my bit of heaven right there.

1206
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I would pay for that.

1207
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I mean, so that I don't have to gingerly handle my, you know, CD and go,

1208
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
oh, please don't scratch, please don't scratch.

1209
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Where's one of the burns of it?

1210
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Okay, my burn doesn't work.

1211
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Damn.

1212
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Because that's what I go through every time I play that game.

1213
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
All right.

1214
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Well, one other thing Jamie goes through every week is that she likes to open up the mailbag

1215
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
and read some e-mails that you guys send in to us at mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com,

1216
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
and she reads the mails and responds to them right here on our program.

1217
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And she's going to do that right now.

1218
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Well, the first one comes from someone named Guy.

1219
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Actually, apparently one of our listeners from the UK.

1220
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Hey, by the way, Guy.

1221
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I was kind of mad that you weren't in the Final Fight they put on Super Nintendo until way later.

1222
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I just want to point that out because Guy was my favorite.

1223
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Sorry, go ahead and read.

1224
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I actually have Final Fight Guy.

1225
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Read the damn e-mails.

1226
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Sorry.

1227
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Did I tell you about my Final Fight collection?

1228
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I was trying to collect every version of Final Fight.

1229
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Dude, they need to put Final Fight Guy on Virtual Console.

1230
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I have Final Fight Guy, though.

1231
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Anyway, sorry.

1232
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
With the box.

1233
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
We totally just lost a listener.

1234
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Sorry.

1235
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Hi.

1236
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I don't get why all the movies and games are out in America before.

1237
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
In England, is it because America is a bigger financial target?

1238
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Thanks, Guy.

1239
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
What's your speculation?

1240
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It's your TVs because they have to convert everything for the other format,

1241
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
and I think that's what causes things to get delayed.

1242
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Everyone needs to have a HDTV, and then it won't matter.

1243
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So maybe in five years because HDTV is picking up more and more,

1244
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
but for right now, yeah, it's your TVs.

1245
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Sorry.

1246
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I've got my Gorillaz DVDs.

1247
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
They're PAL.

1248
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I had to run through my laptop into the TV.

1249
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Yeah, it's a pain for us.

1250
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
When you guys have stuff we want, which happens once in a while

1251
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
with music and videos and things of that nature

1252
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
because you guys get a lot more music stuff over there.

1253
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Oh, it's Region 2, but it's PAL.

1254
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Exactly.

1255
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I remember one big thing that I had friends doing

1256
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
was that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was out on DVD over there

1257
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
way sooner than it was over here.

1258
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Highlander.

1259
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:05,000
When the Highlander series came out, the UK versions had extra footage.

1260
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
So take comfort that once in a while you get something the nerds really want.

1261
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,000
You get them unedited, and freaking Torchwood has blood and sex and language,

1262
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
and I love it.

1263
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
So, sorry.

1264
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I had to go off on that because I was watching Torchwood

1265
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
and going, wow, this wouldn't make it here.

1266
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Anyway, we have one from Miso.

1267
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
It says, I'm Miso Sky.

1268
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Is the creation of video games similar to an art form?

1269
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I think it is, as it involves creativity.

1270
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
It could be closely related to theater arts because it is a collaborative art.

1271
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
You have your music people, your writers, your technical people.

1272
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
So I think it could be an art form.

1273
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Happy Yule, Miso.

1274
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I agree.

1275
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
It's kind of like, I think it's very similar to a movie.

1276
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
It's like an interactive movie, especially these days.

1277
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I mean, movies, storyboarded, games storyboarded.

1278
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
There are similarities between the way that they go,

1279
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
the scripting and the concept and everything.

1280
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I think it's a visual art form.

1281
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I mean, sometimes when you say art form, people want to compare it to paintings.

1282
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
They want to compare it to Picasso.

1283
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
No, art's a lot of different things.

1284
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Well, it's like spoken word is art,

1285
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
but you don't put it in the same category as you do music

1286
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
because it's like poetry readings.

1287
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Yeah, art is subjective.

1288
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
If you're going to call movies art, you have to call games art.

1289
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Honestly, because if you're going to call live theater art,

1290
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
you've got to call movies art in a way.

1291
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
So to me, especially with a game like Final Fantasy XII,

1292
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
which feels like freaking Lord of the Rings epic when you play it,

1293
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
you can't tell me that's not an art form like a movie.

1294
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Well, even the actual physical art that goes into it.

1295
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I mean, we had, what was the...

1296
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:52,000
The bonus disc that has all the actual arts, like drawing art.

1297
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Or the gallery showings that had an E3.

1298
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Oh, sure.

1299
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Oh, the I.M. 8-bit and all that stuff.

1300
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
That was that book I got you.

1301
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1302
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
But that was the gallery too.

1303
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
The pixel one too.

1304
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Well, you know where we're going with this.

1305
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Yeah, but yeah.

1306
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
We got another email from Ricky that says,

1307
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Hi, DS Sky and Loki, how are you guys?

1308
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Well, thank you and well said.

1309
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
This is a show I've been listening for a year now,

1310
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
pop in the chatroom every now and then,

1311
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
and would like to say thank you for all the times

1312
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
where your long-running shows keep me entertained

1313
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
through my travels on planes and long car trips.

1314
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
You're welcome.

1315
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
You guys pulled through for me as I waited for a wee

1316
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
and did not manage to get one.

1317
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Many people asked what I was listening to

1318
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
since I was sitting still for a few hours,

1319
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
so I just had to tell them about your amazing show, of course.

1320
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Good PR, heh heh.

1321
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Thank you.

1322
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Good job.

1323
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
The O.L. Army salutes you.

1324
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I have also spread the word at school to let O.L.R.

1325
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
widely known amongst my fellow classmates.

1326
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I work on the school newspaper

1327
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
and I write the entertainment column,

1328
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
so I decided to spread some love.

1329
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I'm going to keep this short.

1330
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I have to study for exams, so peace and love to all.

1331
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
That was very sweet.

1332
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
That's it?

1333
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
They just wrote to write in what the great PR they're doing?

1334
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Well, thank you.

1335
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I mean, we really appreciate that.

1336
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
That's, you know, because, you know,

1337
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
we do do this for free and all that stuff.

1338
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
That's really if you feel like you want to give us something,

1339
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
give us word of mouth because we don't have the luxury

1340
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
of, you know, a corporate sibling magazine

1341
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
that can run four-page ads, you know,

1342
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
every month for our little dumb show

1343
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
or, you know, we don't have the corporate tie-ins,

1344
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
the companies that we rely on word of mouth

1345
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
and things of that nature to get our name out there.

1346
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So if you feel like you want to give us something,

1347
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
you don't have to give us your money.

1348
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Give us your word of mouth.

1349
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I'll tell you what, though.

1350
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Give us your loyalty and your soul.

1351
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I'll tell you what, Ricky.

1352
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
If you shoot me an e-mail,

1353
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I'd actually like to see the newspaper.

1354
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
So I will pay for the cost of the newspaper

1355
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
and shipping via PayPal.

1356
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Sweet.

1357
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
If you want to send me a copy so that we can see the article.

1358
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
We want to see that, too.

1359
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1360
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
We'll put it on the fridge.

1361
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Actually, we'll scan it in and put it up on the site.

1362
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
If we can.

1363
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
It could be a copyright thing.

1364
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
If it's not copyrighted, we will.

1365
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
We'll put it on the fridge, at least.

1366
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
If it is, we'll seek permission.

1367
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
All right.

1368
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Okay.

1369
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But I figured, yeah, I would really love to see that

1370
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
and besides that, you know,

1371
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I want to encourage our young journalists

1372
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
and good luck on your exams.

1373
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I have one from Anush.

1374
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
It says,

1375
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Hi, Jamie, Rob, and Matt.

1376
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Rob, I was wondering if you guys will be doing an OLR meetup

1377
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
like you did in New York City anyway.

1378
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Have a great show, you guys.

1379
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Where?

1380
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
That's a good question.

1381
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I don't know.

1382
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Well, I guess there's going to be an opportunity

1383
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
to talk about live appearances that we're doing.

1384
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Really, the next thing we have scheduled

1385
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
is that we're going to do,

1386
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
at least I'm going to be up for sure.

1387
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I don't know about my two partners in crime here.

1388
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I will be at Sakura Con in April in Seattle

1389
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
and there's going to be at least hopefully one panel

1390
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
that goes with that.

1391
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
That's the only live thing I have scheduled for right now.

1392
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I may or may not be able to make it to Sakura Con.

1393
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
If I travel in the next year like I did to New York City,

1394
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
certainly I'll do some type of meetup.

1395
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
It's a little too early to tell the places

1396
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
that we're looking at right now.

1397
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
My travel buddy, my best friend who I travel with all the time

1398
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
and I are looking at,

1399
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I'm looking at possibly Toronto or Hawaii.

1400
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I know those are really strange choices

1401
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
but we really want to go back to Canada

1402
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
because we love Vancouver

1403
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
and he's never been to Hawaii so I want to go to Hawaii.

1404
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I'm also planning, and this is still up in the air

1405
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
as I have to find a good package deal and everything,

1406
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,000
I'm planning for hopefully around Christmas, New Year 2007

1407
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
of going to London.

1408
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I definitely want to do the UK at some point as well

1409
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
and I know we have a lot of great listeners over there

1410
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
who I'd love to meet up with for tea and crumpets at some point.

1411
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Well, for me it's going to be pub crawling.

1412
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Whatever. All right.

1413
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
But anyway, yeah, that's...

1414
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Especially if you have anything in California,

1415
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Northern California, we can easily get to the Bay Area

1416
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
and even Southern California to some extent

1417
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
if you have something like a convention that you're planning or whatever,

1418
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
we're definitely open to ideas.

1419
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
We're not too diva.

1420
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Our list of demands is pretty low

1421
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
so get in touch with one of us.

1422
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
And of course I will be going to Alabama again.

1423
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Because we love to pimp out our show wherever we can.

1424
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
But hopefully I'll be flying into New Orleans

1425
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
so maybe I can do a meet up when I fly out there

1426
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
and I'll let everybody know when I go.

1427
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And I go to Disneyland all the time.

1428
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
So no one's found me yet.

1429
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Anyway, this next one is a very special email.

1430
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
It comes from Kyle Snyder.

1431
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Dude, sweet. Kyle Snyder, for those who don't know,

1432
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
we used to do pretty much exclusively a show about DDR.

1433
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
So Kyle Freestyler for DDR.

1434
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Music writer extraordinaire.

1435
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Does music, his own stuff as well.

1436
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
He's a bit of a celebrity amongst the...

1437
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
He's like a DDR celeb.

1438
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
He's like up there with the Mel Bs and the Mr. Wendels

1439
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
and the folks you well know in the freestyle world.

1440
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Anyway, we still have the...

1441
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
You know what?

1442
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
People to this day still mimic that butterfly freestyle.

1443
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
So you know what?

1444
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
That's the ultimate compliment.

1445
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Imitation is the finest form of flattery.

1446
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
William Hung of the DDR community.

1447
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I don't know.

1448
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I don't know if I like that comparison.

1449
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Sort of.

1450
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
He's Kyle. That's it.

1451
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
He's Kyle.

1452
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
There is no other he's Kyle.

1453
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
He disappeared for a little while, but now he's back.

1454
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Dear crew of OLR,

1455
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,000
As you are aware, I have been back from my mission for almost two months.

1456
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I'm only going to be creating one more song on my current music mixing program

1457
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
before I get a new and better one, Acid.

1458
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
My new song should be up in about two weeks after the song

1459
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
after I get a new music mixing program,

1460
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
and my new music should hopefully sound better.

1461
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I'm planning on creating a remix to I Can Never Be Japanese,

1462
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
most likely a happy hardcore remix.

1463
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
That'll be fun, actually.

1464
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Is there anything you would like for me to work on for future songs

1465
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
such as Eurobeat, Gabo, Electro, or any other genre?

1466
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I might not have a lot of time to create music starting mid-January

1467
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
since I'll be starting college at that time.

1468
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
One of your fans, Cal Snyder.

1469
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
P.S. I plan to major in biotechnology.

1470
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Wow.

1471
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
That's pretty hardcore. Good luck.

1472
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Do what makes you happy.

1473
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
We don't want to tell you what music to do

1474
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
because you should make the music that speaks to you.

1475
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
But I will say this.

1476
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I can't say too much,

1477
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
but I can say that a pretty well-known music franchise

1478
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
is going to be doing a contest pretty soon where you can be in the game.

1479
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
At least I think.

1480
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I think that's still being negotiated.

1481
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
So I say save something really good for that

1482
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
because I think you'd want to be in a video game, wouldn't you?

1483
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
That's pretty cool.

1484
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
And that goes for anybody out there who's making music.

1485
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
My advice in this, actually,

1486
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
because a lot of what goes in physical art goes into music art,

1487
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
you know, go where your instincts lead you.

1488
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Don't stick to a style.

1489
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Experiment.

1490
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
You know, even if it comes out like complete crap,

1491
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
if you've learned something from it, then you've progressed.

1492
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
That's what I have to say.

1493
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
So, moving on.

1494
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
We have one, actually, from the SoberIrishGuy.

1495
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
That's cool.

1496
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
The one.

1497
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
The one.

1498
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Okay.

1499
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
As first off, generic thanks and praise-like things from Ireland,

1500
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
your show has landed onto the Irish scene.

1501
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Anyway, onto something important-ish.

1502
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I've been listening to the downloads and loving them for quite a while now,

1503
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
but I need to make a request.

1504
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Every time you give release dates for the UK,

1505
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
this is going to now be wired.

1506
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I see.

1507
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
This is the email that inspired that.

1508
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I always think, well, that's not me.

1509
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
And for the past 90 years, anyway.

1510
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Since you're always talking about European gamers

1511
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
and how we keep getting screwed with release dates and Bahmani releases,

1512
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
they don't actually exist over here.

1513
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Thanks a lot, Konami.

1514
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Any chance of getting European release dates?

1515
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I actually am working on it.

1516
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I need to find some sources.

1517
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
What I'm thinking about doing is actually sending in some of my PR contacts

1518
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
at some of the various companies

1519
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
and seeing if they'll give me international release dates.

1520
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Keep in mind, guys, and trust us, we love our international listeners

1521
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
and we love the fact that this little show that we do out of the spare bedroom

1522
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
goes everywhere, everywhere in the world.

1523
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
That's the ultimate compliment.

1524
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But keep in mind, we can't do everybody

1525
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
because India just got the 360,

1526
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
so they've probably got their own release dates,

1527
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
and I'm sure we've got at least one listener there.

1528
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I'd love to do those release dates, too.

1529
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
We would do a show of nothing but release dates.

1530
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
But we'll try.

1531
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
We'll try to do at least the big titles for some places.

1532
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
My idea for this is to do quarterly updates

1533
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
for major countries like, for example, for India,

1534
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
for South America, for Africa.

1535
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Africa.

1536
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Sorry, I couldn't pass that up.

1537
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I hear there's new screenshots of Africa out there on the interweb.

1538
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Well, also, though, for any place that's got similar dates but deviations,

1539
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
I'm going to actually try doing different compilations for my list

1540
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
and seeing if I can't be a little more accommodating.

1541
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I'm doing my best, guys.

1542
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
We'll do what we can, but we do appreciate your suggestion

1543
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
and listening to us in other countries.

1544
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
He also addressed another part to me about Aragon.

1545
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Really?

1546
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Because you know I was complaining about how poorly written the book is.

1547
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Basically, to go into the rest of this email,

1548
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
it says, I've read Aragon, and while it did start a little badly written,

1549
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I enjoyed it, but then again, I've read a lot of fantasy,

1550
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
both bad and good, Dragonlance and Discworld, respectively.

1551
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I actually like Dragonlance, but I also played a lot of D&D

1552
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
when I was into Dragonlance.

1553
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Aragon is a bit slow-paced, and the overall story is good,

1554
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
even if the writing isn't terribly great.

1555
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I have been getting some feedback on the book,

1556
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
just from my friends' local emails I've gotten.

1557
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I have started reading it again,

1558
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,000
even though I've been distracted by copious amounts of Doctor Who

1559
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
and the fact that I'm into reading historical biography now

1560
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
and anthropology books.

1561
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I'll set some time aside for it.

1562
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I'll give it another chance.

1563
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
This story could be better than the writing.

1564
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I've read worse fan fiction, so I'm going to give it a go.

1565
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
In closing, it says, anyhow, that's it from this side of the Atlantic.

1566
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Keep up the show and keep uploading it.

1567
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
D&D 9 is not a good time to be awake.

1568
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I also sort of want to wake up in the middle of the morning

1569
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
for myself and say, hey, overseas people, listen to me,

1570
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
because I am randomly awake on the weekends that early.

1571
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Moving forward, the last email comes...

1572
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Oh, I just want to say real quickly,

1573
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
some of our tape shows, such as the new STFU show that's not live,

1574
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
it's taped, we might actually play those at an hour

1575
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
that would be friendly for the folks overseas.

1576
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
We are exploring doing that, because it's really easy for us

1577
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
to do the rebroadcast of the tape shows,

1578
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
so something to look forward to.

1579
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Last one comes from Robert.

1580
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I really missed you guys this week.

1581
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I like your name, Robert.

1582
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Aww, thank you for missing us.

1583
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Anyway, I've just unlocked the first bonus mission on Elite Beat Agents,

1584
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
and although I'm nowhere near ready to say I'm all that good at the game yet,

1585
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I was wondering if there's a soundtrack mode

1586
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
or audio test mode unlockable in the game

1587
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
to listen to the music outside of the game.

1588
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
It's amazing the amount of digital audio they were able to fit into that cartridge.

1589
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I don't know of any.

1590
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I'm sure someone might figure out a little hack or crack for the cartridge.

1591
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I would say, honestly, the songs are so close to their originals that,

1592
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
well, not always.

1593
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Some are sped up, like a couple of songs are sped up,

1594
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
so I guess I could see why you'd want that.

1595
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
You never know.

1596
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Some folks are able to creatively rip from the game.

1597
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Some people do that.

1598
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Check some of those various sound archive sites,

1599
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
especially for those really big in import games.

1600
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I'll bet you see something.

1601
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
You know what we had to do back in the 80s?

1602
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
We held up our boombox to our TVs and recorded it, and we liked it.

1603
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
That might be how you have to do it.

1604
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I don't know.

1605
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
So that's it.

1606
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
That was it.

1607
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
No more emails?

1608
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
No more.

1609
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
How sad.

1610
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
That's all right.

1611
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Send us more.

1612
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

1613
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
We love to hear from you.

1614
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Someone who doesn't like to hear from you so much is Capcom.

1615
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,000
They totally ignore the folks who are bitching about dead rising text being too small,

1616
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
and I guess in a way I'm teasing them a little bit, but what could they really do?

1617
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I mean, do you think that is something that really could have been patched?

1618
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
That's a pretty big game element.

1619
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I don't think that's something that could have been delivered in an itty bitty patch,

1620
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
so I think they realized they botched it there,

1621
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
or at least I thought they realized they botched it there.

1622
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Then the Lost Planet demo came out,

1623
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
and I haven't played it yet, but I've seen pictures of it,

1624
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
and yes, the text, once again, uber small,

1625
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
but this time they've changed it.

1626
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Folks were bitching on the Internet about the small text,

1627
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
and so Capcom sent out some screenshots and said,

1628
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
hey, listen you jerks who keep bashing us.

1629
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
We fixed it.

1630
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Here's a screenshot to prove it.

1631
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Remember that beta games and test games are not always indicative of the final release.

1632
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:50,000
STFU, bitches, in so many words, is what they said.

1633
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
But their last game, which pretty much is their only game on the 360 right now,

1634
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
had small text, and that was indicative of the demo,

1635
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
so what do you expect?

1636
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I mean, they're just going based off of their prior track record.

1637
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Well, I'm sure Capcom's learned their lesson.

1638
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Well, good. I'm glad it took them only one game to do that.

1639
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
So, you know, that's always good.

1640
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
I guess I'm spoiled because I am an HDTV owner,

1641
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
and I didn't find the text in Dead Rising to be that bad.

1642
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
It wasn't that bad.

1643
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
It wasn't that bad at all.

1644
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Yeah, but again, you have Mondo, Hugh Joe TV in the living room,

1645
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
and you have a TV that's bigger than mine, too,

1646
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
so we're all spoiled, you know, for our friends on standard TVs.

1647
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Dead Rising on a standard TV, too.

1648
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Really? You didn't think it was a pain in the ass?

1649
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
No.

1650
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Blurry?

1651
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
The only thing I noticed was my monitor's too dark,

1652
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
so I can't see anything when it turns night.

1653
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Then people just complain too much. I don't know what to tell you.

1654
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
But, whatever.

1655
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
So anyways, issues that need to be ironed out.

1656
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Well, apparently the new movie and TV download service for Microsoft's Xbox 360

1657
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
has a little bit of some issues there.

1658
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
For example, the movie downloads.

1659
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Way too damn slow.

1660
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I haven't really tried it yet, because I don't really...

1661
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Neither have I. There's not a damn thing on there I want.

1662
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Yeah, it's just, you know, maybe if I miss an episode of something, I don't know, but...

1663
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I was going to get Star Trek Generations, but then it wasn't in HD,

1664
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
so I was like, well, pfft, forget it.

1665
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I only want to do this because it has HD movies.

1666
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,000
So, bring me more HD movies I'm interested in, and I'll maybe take a look.

1667
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I've also heard issues of people downloading stuff and getting something else.

1668
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
But apparently, they are going about to fix this stuff,

1669
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,000
and I guess for the first initial downloads, if you did download something or whatever,

1670
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
or tried to download something, and got your credits taken away,

1671
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
and weren't able to download it, they will be refunding you your points and stuff.

1672
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
So, it's a work in progress.

1673
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:46,000
But, once again, they really need to test this stuff before they go and release it.

1674
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
It's like a lot of the games, you know?

1675
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Oh, it goes out, and oh, by the way, the...

1676
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Can you really test thousands of people downloading your movie at once, though?

1677
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Yeah, it's called an online beta test.

1678
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
They have stress tests. That's what they do.

1679
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,000
That's what a stress test is, to test to see if your servers can handle people downloading stuff.

1680
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
I remember when I was testing Test Drive Unlimited,

1681
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
they would have you, okay, we need everybody to go to this one spot and start a race.

1682
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:20,000
We're going to see if this spot can handle the stress test of thousands of people doing that.

1683
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And that's what they do. They specifically try to break it.

1684
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,000
And, obviously, they're just not testing it enough.

1685
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And same with the network play.

1686
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,000
How the fuck are you playing Call of Duty 3 or something like that not know,

1687
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,000
especially after the last one, that the online play is going to be laggy as fuck,

1688
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:42,000
and you release the game anyways to make it there for the holiday rush.

1689
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
You know right away that it's not going to work, but you're just planning on patching it later.

1690
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
It's kind of like, oh well, whatever, it's good enough for now, you know, we'll patch it later.

1691
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
People will buy it anyways, and they do.

1692
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Because how are they supposed to know?

1693
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
That's ridiculous.

1694
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Well, speaking of the other things that are going to be available, at least online and beta testing,

1695
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
there is going to be a beta test for Halo 3, a public beta.

1696
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:18,000
The signup begins on the 4th, that's this Monday, so people will already be listening by that point, hopefully.

1697
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:26,000
But you would have to go to Halo3.com on Monday and start your signup.

1698
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:33,000
They're basically saying that Halo 3 beta will be available in the US, Europe, other places internationally,

1699
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
and they are going to keep the updates through that site.

1700
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
So that's good, but if you don't manage to get in on that though,

1701
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
there are going to be premium multiplayer maps for Halo 2 coming out as well.

1702
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
This is going to be available in the spring.

1703
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
And there's going to be more info on the beta in the next coming weeks according to our Microsoft reps.

1704
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:55,000
We bugged him when we first saw this, we were like, how can you get us in?

1705
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Have you bugged him about that whole March release date? Is that what they're still sticking to?

1706
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
No, he wasn't the one that told you that though, right?

1707
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
He wasn't the one that told me that. I haven't bugged him yet about that.

1708
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Well, just to say, I am going to try to sign up for the beta.

1709
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Can we? Doesn't this show disqualify us from that? Or are you just all going to lie?

1710
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Well, we don't get paid for it, so...

1711
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I signed up for the Shadowrun beta, which is also this week, for the 360,

1712
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
so that might be another one if you want to try to get in on something.

1713
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
That's another thing that's going on too.

1714
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Well, it's sort of a part of it. We're going to get reports on it anyway, is how I see it.

1715
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
But my whole thing is, I love beta testing.

1716
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Well, I tried to sign up for a beta test, and the first question they asked was,

1717
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
do you work for a gaming website or whatever?

1718
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I thought, yeah, because that's kind of what we do here, and it booted me.

1719
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
No, no, no. Work implies that you get paid.

1720
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I guess that's true.

1721
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Therefore, I do not work in the hobby.

1722
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
The way the question was worded, I wanted to...

1723
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I'm not going to lie, but just for a silly beta test,

1724
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
the way it was worded, and I don't want to say what site it was for,

1725
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
but it was a pretty major gaming operation,

1726
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I was signing up, and it booted me right out for that.

1727
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I've gotten selected for quite a few beta tests lately.

1728
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I've actually gotten selected for betas through...

1729
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Well, fuck you and fuck you, because I don't get paid for anything.

1730
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Through the media mailings, because I'll have the media send out.

1731
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I did the Phantasy Star Universe beta. I guess that's something.

1732
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Everybody did that, though.

1733
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
All right, whatever.

1734
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I didn't do that.

1735
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I'll look. If I can sign up, I will.

1736
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
If not, I'm not going to lose sleep over it.

1737
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Whatever.

1738
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Whatever.

1739
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
One thing I am pretty interested in checking out on Xbox

1740
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,000
would be Double Dragon coming to Xbox Live with a full co-op mode,

1741
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,000
and this report coming from the official Xbox magazine in the UK.

1742
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Only 12.5 megabytes for the game.

1743
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I'm assuming this is based off of not the well-known Nintendo version,

1744
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,000
but the arcade release that I believe Tecmos put out.

1745
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I'm guessing, because most of the Xbox games have been their arcade counterpart,

1746
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
and I just don't see an NES game showing up on the Xbox.

1747
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
So, going to be the arcade version, I'm sure.

1748
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Online co-op, probably be pretty cool, as long as it's not laggy as hell,

1749
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
so I hope you did your stress test.

1750
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Yeah, I was going to say, as long as it's able to stay synced, unlike Contra.

1751
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
So.

1752
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
I still haven't played Contra online.

1753
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I don't, nope, none of my friends have it.

1754
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I'm like the only one of my friends unless it hasn't.

1755
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
I have Contra.

1756
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Do you? Let's play!

1757
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Let's get some achievements online!

1758
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Points!

1759
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
That's all.

1760
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Are you sure?

1761
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Yep.

1762
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Are you sure you're sure?

1763
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Yes.

1764
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Okay, okay, okay.

1765
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Well, anyway, Microsoft, speaking of which,

1766
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:37,000
has decided that they are going to release the 1080p fix.

1767
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
It's a dashboard update.

1768
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Basically, you are going to, when you log into Xbox Live,

1769
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
the patch is supposed to fix everything.

1770
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
You don't have to download the update, but you can't connect to Live until you do.

1771
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I was going to say, I don't think, yeah, because I was trying,

1772
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I got the patch last night when I was playing one of those Burger King games,

1773
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
and it made me do it, so.

1774
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
But I'm pretty much always on Live, so.

1775
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Well, it's also trying to also improve the accuracy of the reporting on things.

1776
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
You'll see changes to your recently played games.

1777
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Oh, interesting.

1778
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Alright, cool.

1779
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I couldn't tell you what it did for 1080p, though, because my TV doesn't support it, so.

1780
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Well, it's supposed to also have improved plug and play for your headsets and the wireless controllers.

1781
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Again, something I don't have.

1782
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It's also supposed to fix some VGA cable stuff, too.

1783
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Now, you have that. You could try that, I guess.

1784
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Yeah, but I don't have a TV that does 1080p with VGA cables.

1785
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Oh, there you go.

1786
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Alright.

1787
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Anyways, so one thing I'm kind of a little sad about,

1788
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
and so far I haven't really tried it, so I'm not really sure if this has affected anything yet,

1789
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:53,000
but apparently Microsoft is taking precautions and blocking some of the Europe Live users

1790
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:01,000
that are using the region workaround to be able to download demos that are available to the US.

1791
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And apparently they are blocking the accounts, not necessarily banning them.

1792
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:12,000
And I've done this over here to download Japanese demos and stuff, and it's fun.

1793
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,000
But so far they've only confirmed that they've been blocking the UK ones.

1794
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,000
They've been blocking them from downloading our demos and whatnot.

1795
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Apparently some licensing issues or something. I don't know.

1796
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
But whatever.

1797
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
We're next.

1798
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
We're not next. We're spoiled.

1799
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
But I don't know. I haven't tried it yet, so we'll see.

1800
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I guess we'll see.

1801
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Now, this was causing some rumors to go around that they were banning people, right?

1802
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
But then they came out and said, no, we're not banning anyone, just blocking.

1803
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Yeah, it's just blocking people, because really they're just silver accounts anyway,

1804
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
so I mean, yeah, sure, go ahead, ban the silver account.

1805
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
You can't just create a new one.

1806
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Folks are starting rumors that, oh, your gold that's on the same system is going to get banned too,

1807
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
and I'm like, that would cause problems.

1808
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
They're just going to say, no, we don't want money.

1809
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Right.

1810
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Well, regardless, the mere idea that we're going to be robbed from checking out the Japanese and other international demos

1811
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
has our feathers ruffled a little bit,

1812
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
because we love to import here at Orange Launch Radio from our friends in Japan

1813
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
and occasionally other countries too when they get stuff we want,

1814
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
and so I feel a little bit angsty about this news,

1815
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:33,000
so I think it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.

1816
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Yes, that's right, kids.

1817
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
This is the part of the show where we get ranty and angsty,

1818
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:42,000
and who better to start us off when it comes to rants and angst than Dark Sakura?

1819
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Amazingly enough, I am not angsty about anything today.

1820
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I'm not ranty. I'm on new medication.

1821
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Hell froze over, ladies and gentlemen. It's happened.

1822
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Somebody's skiing in hell right now.

1823
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Jamie's not angsty, and I'm just fucking with you.

1824
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
No.

1825
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I'm glad to hear things are such really happy.

1826
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
We finally found a treatment that's helping me with my chronic disease.

1827
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Anyone who's a fetal chosen is a chronic disease girl.

1828
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
But it's finally gotten something that helps, so I'm not really all that upset about much.

1829
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I'm pretty happy, actually, except for the person who took my blood at Kaiser.

1830
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
You freaking always leave bruises on me.

1831
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Because, like, plot, plot, blood, out.

1832
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Fine, but what about the bruise on my arm?

1833
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Oh, will you do that anyway?

1834
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Because she's taken my blood a couple times before.

1835
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Like, whatever, lady.

1836
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Just, whatever. I don't like walking around looking like a freaking heroin addict or something.

1837
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
So, that's it.

1838
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Lucky.

1839
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Um, F.U. to my lower back right now. It's apparently a way my bed's situated in our bedroom.

1840
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Um, I'm next to the window, and the window, because it's in an apartment, has horrible seals.

1841
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:58,000
So, like, everything that's on the backside of my body, like, my neck, my back, and everything are completely sore right now.

1842
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:04,000
It feels like I was in a fight or something, but it's just from the cold air because it's winter.

1843
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It sucks.

1844
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:11,000
So, I feel like an old person, like, oh, my back!

1845
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Uh, I'm relatively in good spirits as well, so I'll just have to say F.U. to being so busy.

1846
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Because, you know, it's the reason why I have to pre-tape tonight, and I got, you know,

1847
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,000
like, four different things I'm doing today and more I'm doing tomorrow.

1848
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
But it's hard for me to complain too much because I have Monday off work.

1849
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:36,000
So, you know, I guess F.U. to the crowds at the mall I'll be fighting because I guess I'm going to try and do some holiday shopping during that time.

1850
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
So, we'll see. We'll see.

1851
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Wow, I'm glad to hear everyone's in relatively good spirits.

1852
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Hey, this will put some of our listeners in even better spirits.

1853
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,000
We have a story about lesbians.

1854
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Yay!

1855
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Alright, lesbians, hooray!

1856
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:58,000
There was this story ran on this site called gamesradar.com,

1857
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:04,000
which I guess is actually some corporate website, but I'd never heard of it until this story, so whatever.

1858
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:12,000
They are going over the top seven lesbian kisses in video games ever.

1859
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Let's see, it started off with number seven was Kitana and Mileena with their fatalities, right?

1860
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Because remember how Kitana would kiss Mileena and then she'd blow up and then, you know, all that stuff.

1861
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Or that Mileena would kiss Kitana and then like suck her in and that's it.

1862
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
She'd eat her face or something.

1863
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Jade Empire came in at number six with their little girl on girl action on the eve of battle.

1864
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:37,000
And they have a little hot picture to go with it there, so if you're into lesbians you might like that.

1865
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
I like this one here. This is probably my favorite of the whole series.

1866
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Outlaw Golf 2 for the Xbox and Playstation 2.

1867
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:53,000
This would be when Summer, who is a stripper in the original Outlaw Golf, she gets with her partner Autumn

1868
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:58,000
and they do this whole girl on girl thing and it's pretty hot, I guess, if you're into lesbians.

1869
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Number four was from Fear Effect 2 Retro Helix, which was, you know, kind of an older game for Playstation 1 on 2001.

1870
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:14,000
And there's this chick Hannah and her applied lover Rain.

1871
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,000
They do a make out in an elevator to distract some guards.

1872
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
No nudity involved though.

1873
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,000
The number three hottest lesbian kiss in video games ever from GamesRadar.com.

1874
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
They said that Persephone and Niobe in Enter the Matrix.

1875
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I remember that one because I actually played Enter the Matrix on, I think it was GameCube.

1876
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:42,000
And I remember that scene. So that's some Monica Bellucci and Jada Pinkett action there in your live action clip.

1877
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:52,000
And then in Leisure Suit Larry Magna Cum Laude from the character Luba who likes to get naked and make out with chicks at number two.

1878
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
I remember playing that game.

1879
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:01,000
And the number one lesbian kiss game, Sims 2 with the do it yourself make outs.

1880
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:10,000
And they show a little clip here from the Sims 2 of some, you know, girls in scantily clad bikinis all over each other on their leopard print bed.

1881
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Now wait a minute. There is another game though I know that they had. It was full nudity and everything.

1882
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:21,000
I can't remember what it was called though because it was some other Sims like knock off game.

1883
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:27,000
And I remember they were doing a thing on somethingawful.com.

1884
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:33,000
They were kind of reviewing the game and talking about how he would make his characters force them to be gay.

1885
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Against their will type thing.

1886
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Interesting. You know what I'm trying to think? Well, okay, where's the list of the top seven gay male kisses ever?

1887
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
And I'm like, God, I can't hardly think of any games that have that.

1888
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Bully, Final Fantasy VII, I guess.

1889
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
What?

1890
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Wasn't there a part with like the whole gay thing in there?

1891
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
There was the Barret Date.

1892
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Oh, the Barret Date. That doesn't count.

1893
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I've got the Barret Date.

1894
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
There's no making out action in the Barret Date.

1895
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
What it is, some Japanese player decided to get the Barret Date.

1896
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:12,000
And so back when the Dex drive was really big and I downloaded a Dex file, translated it for the US one and played it on my game.

1897
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
And it was funny. It was really funny.

1898
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Interesting.

1899
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
The Yuffie one was stupid. I've seen the Yuffie one as well.

1900
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I hate Aerith so all I've done myself is...

1901
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I'm pretty sure when I played through the game that's who I went on the date with was Aerith.

1902
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
She sucks.

1903
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
I liked her.

1904
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
She's dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

1905
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
But she'll always be talked about through flashbacks so screw you, hippie.

1906
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Anyways, so speaking of...

1907
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Oh, by the way, I want to say if anyone from GamesRadar is listening, I hope you weren't hurt that I didn't know your website but most people don't know us so we're used to it.

1908
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:50,000
But you should do the top seven gay guy kisses next for us to report on next week.

1909
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:58,000
So anyways, speaking of games that are out there that kind of are interesting.

1910
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
There's a new Bubble Bubble game coming out for the DS.

1911
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Bubble Bubble Doubleshot has been announced.

1912
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:12,000
It's a co-op dinosaur game and of course hopefully we'll have a level 30 boss.

1913
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I know, I was like, must refrain from joke, must refrain from joke.

1914
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Oh, I can't! Is there going to be a boss in level 30, you stupids?

1915
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:27,000
It's slated for quarter one of 2007 and honestly I can say I think we've had enough Bubble Bubble titles in the last, you know, year.

1916
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Yeah, I know. I love Bubble Bubble but damn. Damn.

1917
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Oh, that was another one that came out I forgot to mention that's coming out next week here.

1918
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Bubble Bubble Evolution for the PSP.

1919
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Whoopee!

1920
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Yeah, so...

1921
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Hooray.

1922
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Alright, something else that will be coming to you very soon is Dark Sakura's website of the week.

1923
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:56,000
She serves the internet all over to look for a website that she wants to share with you and she has one for you right now.

1924
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
It's her website of the week.

1925
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Dark Sakura, tell the kids what it is.

1926
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,000
This is a website that I'm sure everybody knows about and it's about damn time I mentioned it.

1927
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Today's website of the week is 4chan.org.

1928
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
The number 4, C-H-A-N dot O-R-G.

1929
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,000
4chan, where the internet also goes to die when it's not at MySpace.

1930
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Home of Caturday.

1931
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Home of lots of lovely, lovely Yowie and Yuri and Bunch of Hentai and Mecha and all kinds of art.

1932
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Cosplay.

1933
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
You wanna know something funny?

1934
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
What?

1935
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I've never been to this site. I hear about it all the time but I just have never thought to go to it.

1936
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Ugh.

1937
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Isn't that weird?

1938
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
4chan has lots of fun but I love Caturday.

1939
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
That sounds worthy of a visitation.

1940
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Also though on 4chan, the other cool thing is the Oikaki board where basically you draw.

1941
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Oh, weren't those really huge on the internet a couple years ago where you'd have the paint program basically and you could save your paint and post it?

1942
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Yeah, that was huge a few years ago.

1943
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:10,000
My very first Oikaki that I ever did was of Leifmon.

1944
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I don't like that name. That sounds too close to Bu-E-Kake.

1945
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
No, that's Bu-Kake.

1946
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I know it's Bu-Kake but it's close.

1947
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Bu-Kake and Oikaki, I should say.

1948
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
O-E-Kake, not Bu-Kake.

1949
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Although you will find lots of Bu-Kake on 4chan.

1950
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Hooray.

1951
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
And it has an IRC channel so yeah.

1952
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I like 4chan. I'm sorry, there's some really horrible, stupid stuff on 4chan but I love 4chan.

1953
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Alright, visit it then.

1954
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,000
If you're like me and you've never bothered to, I guess you can go visit it.

1955
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Alright, now what's interesting is that there's some rumors going around about what's coming up with Final Fantasy 6 on the Game Boy Advance.

1956
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:59,000
It's kind of rumor status because it was reported that you're going to be able to have the new characters.

1957
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:04,000
You can do Leo and you can play as Emperor Geshtal too, which I thought was a very strange character addition.

1958
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Usually in these Game Boy releases the games they add new stuff.

1959
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,000
But now they're saying, no, it was all faked.

1960
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Somebody did a really good Photoshop job or a ROM hack job to get Leo and all that stuff in Geshtal in your party.

1961
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
So it's not true.

1962
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
So I guess we won't really know until the game comes out.

1963
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:28,000
However, it does appear that the summons, having new summons in the game, Gilgamesh, Sabertender,

1964
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
they will actually be there.

1965
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:37,000
So at least you'll have that something extra, even if the fangirl fantasy of reviving Leo may in fact not be true.

1966
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,000
How hard would it be to just let them revive Leo already?

1967
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:48,000
But I have to admit, when I read the story it did sound a little bit too good to be true that it was going to be the Phoenix Esper that revived him.

1968
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I'm kind of like, well, that almost sounds a little too cliche.

1969
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I don't know.

1970
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I still would want to check this out, though, because Final Fantasy VI, good game.

1971
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Very good game.

1972
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Interesting.

1973
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Well, Elibits, which is coming out here in a couple weeks, is actually going to be having some Wii Connect 24 functionality, including level trading.

1974
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:16,000
The custom levels are going to be used, basically built with a point system.

1975
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:25,000
The points are charged for each item used to populate the level, including trash cans, Elibits, toy tanks, etc.

1976
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
It says no level can exceed 1,000 points.

1977
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Basically, the levels can be sent to your friends with screenshots.

1978
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
And it's kind of a neat little thing.

1979
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Probably the first game I've seen actually utilize the Wii Connect 24 system, so looking forward to that.

1980
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Picking it up anyways.

1981
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Yeah, Elibits is one of those games that at E3 you were kind of like, eh, whatever.

1982
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:54,000
And then we heard more and more about it, and you and I were lucky enough to see it at the Konami thingy and all that.

1983
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And the game's progressed along nicely.

1984
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Now I'm definitely interested in picking it up.

1985
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
I think there's other people that feel the same way, too.

1986
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
And this Wii Connect 24 sounds very cool.

1987
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:08,000
And I think a lot of people will be picking it up probably just so they can participate in that.

1988
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
It'll be interesting to see what happens.

1989
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Well, that was the last story that we had for you guys tonight.

1990
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Unfortunately, we have no Skype line tonight because we're not actually live.

1991
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:26,000
But we will be back live next week at Orange Lounge Radio and, of course, inviting your calls as always and your participation.

1992
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I'm sure a lot of you have some built-up stuff, having no show last week and now a taped show this week.

1993
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
But is there any last-minute stuff from Loki or Dark Saga?

1994
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Yeah, I've got a couple things.

1995
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
I do as well.

1996
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Well, let's start off with Dark Saga. Why don't you start us off?

1997
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Just for UK news, for Football Manager 2007, Sega and Sports Interactive released a patch for the PC, Mac, and Intel Mac versions of Football Manager 2007.

1998
01:41:52,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Basically, the patch deals with some of the issues that the fans brought up, like some of the bugs that were still in the game.

1999
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:08,000
The patch is saved game compatible, but to get the full effect, you have to start a new game.

2000
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:15,000
You can actually grab it from Sports Interactive's website over there.

2001
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I know it's kind of a big game over there, so I thought I'd bring it up.

2002
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
All right.

2003
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:26,000
If you're looking to use your old Nintendo and Super Nintendo controllers with the Wii Virtual Console games,

2004
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:33,000
there's a website called RetroZone, which is at RetroUSB.com.

2005
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,000
This stuff is actually going to be slash Wii dot HTML.

2006
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
You can buy both the adapters for the NES and Super NES controllers.

2007
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Those are priced at $19 each, including if you buy a second controller, it will have free shipping.

2008
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
That's kind of neat.

2009
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:56,000
You would actually plug into your GameCube ports on the Wii, so that's pretty cool.

2010
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:05,000
And then finally, apparently there's that hacking group Team Executor that was famous for a lot of the PSP stuff.

2011
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:12,000
They've got the full-size SATA hard drive working with the PlayStation 3,

2012
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,000
and now they have 750 gigabytes on their one PlayStation 3.

2013
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
For what? For what?

2014
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,000
For what you may say, well, they're working on running the Blu-ray game.

2015
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
For porn. For 750 gigs of porn on your PS3.

2016
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,000
For running the Blu-ray games off the hard drive.

2017
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,000
All right. I see. Interesting.

2018
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
So that's it.

2019
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,000
All right. Well, that's going to do it then for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

2020
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Hey, we want to thank you guys for still tuning into us and supporting us,

2021
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
even though we weren't here last week.

2022
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,000
We're a little bit shorter this week with only one part,

2023
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:50,000
but you know we love you guys out there on the Internet for listening to us and supporting independent Internet radio,

2024
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
and we will be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2025
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Two parts live and the usual stuff.

2026
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,000
We've missed it, so we'll be seeing you guys next week.

2027
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Until then, on behalf of Jamie Summers and Loki, have a great night.

2028
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
We didn't do final thoughts.

2029
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Oh, crap. We didn't do final thoughts.

2030
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
My bad.

2031
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
My bad.

2032
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Okay, quick. Final thoughts.

2033
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
DarkSaga, Jamie Summers.

2034
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Money.

2035
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Loki.

2036
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I think I'm going to call my new show Screwdriver.

2037
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
I want pumpkin pie.

2038
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Good night.

2039
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Good night.
