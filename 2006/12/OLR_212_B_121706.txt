and now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
This is episode number 212 for this December the 17th and we're here with our part B, the last live segment of 2006.
DarkSakura.com
and DarkSakura.com.
Anyhow, let's get back into some news, some gaming news.
Because our live listeners have been waiting a while for us to get back into some gaming news.
This was a huge story this week.
The Nintendo Wiimote.
Now, I got some email messages and some text messages and phones from listeners and people going, Did you hear the Wiis are being recalled?
So somebody hit a panic button.
So we want to clarify right now.
The Wiis were not recalled.
So I realize some people took what happened and ran with it.
What happened is that Nintendo is offering for customers to exchange the old straps, which are six-tenths of a millimeter in diameter, for a new beefed-up strap that is one millimeter in diameter.
This is in response to those people that are breaking their televisions and the Wiis are breaking off and claiming that it's the straps that are causing them to do this.
You've probably seen that site, WeHaveAProblem.com, seeing the people that have been messing up there.
And I was going to say, real quick, I was going to say the old straps, Nintendojo actually tested them.
They withstand about 50 pounds of pressure.
So these people that are breaking these straps are going above and beyond the amount of stress that should be applied to these things.
So it should be said that Nintendo is not recalling, but they're offering this program for anybody who has a concern.
But again, I've been playing the Wii for a long time.
I can't imagine how that thing would break.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Mass stupidity.
Think across the board.
You don't think there's flukes out there?
There may be very few, if any.
I think that what it is is you've got people out there who are saying, oh, I'm going to swing this just like a baseball bat.
I'm going to backhand this this way.
I'm going to, you know, attach it to something else and use it, which I've heard of happening.
The thing is that you hardly need a flick of the wrist to do anything on the damn Wii Sports games.
or any of the others.
These people are basically using the system in a way other than I think intent because there was even a warning put out for using the Wiimote and if you give me a moment I'll find it because a friend of mine posted it in her live journal except she replaced Wii with penis.
They basically need to just calm down.
They're really kind of
Okay, question number two
Would you say that Nintendo encourages this behavior from the promotional videos we've seen from the Wii?
Because Nintendo kind of says one thing, that you don't need to move the Wiimote that much, but then you see these videos of people really getting into it when it's on the news and everything.
Is Nintendo encouraging that kind of behavior?
But even though they may be flailing around looking like complete idiots, they are not doing it uncontrollably.
I mean, when they're showing them, you know...
Diving on the couch or whatever to play Wii Tennis.
They're not swinging super hard.
They're just acting like a dipshit and diving across the couch.
Here's the safety information from the Nintendo customer service page.
Safety information for playing Wii.
As you become comfortable with the new and innovative Wii Remote, we would like you to take a few minutes to review some important safety information which, when followed, will help ensure a fun playing experience for all.
Wear the wrist strap.
Make sure that all players using the Wii Remote are wearing the wrist strap and that it has been tightened using the strap lock.
When sharing the Wii Remote between multiple players, be sure that each person using the Wii Remote takes the time to properly put on the wrist strap.
Wearing the wrist strap will help prevent the Wii Remote from flying across the room if you accidentally let go of it during gameplay.
Hold the Wii Remote firmly and do not let go.
Even while wearing the wrist strap, make sure that you don't let go of the Wii Remote during gameplay and do not use excessive motion.
For example, in Wii Sports Bowling, the proper way to let go of the ball while bowling is to release the B button on the Wii Remote.
Do not let go of the Wii Remote itself, in bold letters.
If you're having so much fun that you start perspiring, take a moment to dry your hands.
If you use excessive motion and let go of the Wii Remote, the wrist strap may break and you could lose control of the Wii Remote.
This could injure people nearby or cause damage to other objects.
They said this in their warning.
You people are stupid!
Okay, interesting comments from chat I want to say here.
BearWhoDriveCar says, just like the Guitar Hero 2 commercial, you don't need to act that stupid when you play, but it's a commercial, people.
By the way, I love that nickname.
Oh, wait, I want to say one other comment here real quick from chat.orangehaulsradio.com.
Airtos says, might have been a good idea to put rubber grips on the Wiimote.
Interesting thought.
It doesn't do any good if people are letting go of it anyway.
The combination of excessive motion, letting go of the controller, basically you're dealing with basic laws of physics.
You're pulling against the strain with a greater force than what the rope can handle.
Dark Knight says, stupid Americans, and DJ Morpheus says, do not taunt, happy fun we moat.
Winner.
Alright, question number three.
Will Nintendo get sued over this?
Yes.
Yes, they will.
They will get sued because people are stupid and they'll sue over anything.
Amen.
No, okay.
Will they attempt to get sued?
No.
Will it go through?
No.
Okay, having taken business law... Hold on, I'm getting DarkSakura's soapbox.
Let's see.
I'm going to pull it out of the closet here.
Hey, Rob.
Rob, Rob, Rob.
What?
Shut up.
Anyway...
The whole... Alright, I'm going to actually bring up another case that happened a while back in Oklahoma.
And you don't hold Oklahoma responsible for this, I guess.
There was a little kid walking behind someone using a weed whacker.
And it said, do not allow small children within so many feet of it.
Well, the kid was walking behind his uncle picking up sticks and got his arm chopped off with a weed whacker.
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Fuck simulating, dude.
You'll throw it through someone's head.
Actual murder.
I think there was a YouTube video of that.
Anyway, we welcome your thoughts.
To tell a DDR dollar bill, people don't read the warnings, but that's not Nintendo's fault.
Nintendo's duty and responsibility is to make the warning available.
I'd like to mention, though, actually, there was a thing that they were talking about, you know, federal government agencies looking into this and
and apparently there have been recorded three injuries with the Wiimote that resulted in non-hospitalized injuries.
That is it.
I mean, this isn't like killing people.
This is like, oh, I'm throwing it through the wall, I'm breaking a TV.
I'm, you know, I caused a bruise on my hand that clears up in a week.
I mean, just stupid shit like that.
I just want to say this real quick.
I know we want to keep moving the story, but I think this is an interesting perspective.
Funnydale in our chatroom says, they admitted there was a problem with the straps by offering a recall.
And then goes on to say, first rule in corporate America, never admit that there's a problem.
Well, they didn't... It's a gray area.
They didn't admit there's a problem, per se.
I see this as a cover your ass...
It's the same thing with, remember the Pokemon toys that Burger King was putting out and the babies were suffocating on the ball when it clearly said do not let anyone under three years of age have a Pokeball.
The duty and responsibility was in the parents for allowing their child to have it.
Babymon, I choose you!
But it is a likely thing.
Babies will put stuff in their mouths.
They're learning what their mouth is for, basically.
So it was really the parents' responsibility.
But Burger King still recalled the Pokeballs so that they would not be held further liable for damages.
And I think that Nintendo is trying to take a precautionary step to avoid further problems.
Now, here's the thing I have to ask you.
Oh, we have to keep it moving after this comment.
Okay.
Like, for example, if I have a baseball bat and I throw the baseball bat and it hits someone in the head, I'm responsible for that injury.
I shouldn't be able to sue the baseball bat company...
for the injury caused by that baseball bat.
Same thing goes with the Wiimote.
I think that if you let go of the Wiimote and it flies out of your hand and through your TV, the only person you can blame is yourself because you're an idiot.
It's as simple as that.
Anyways, and speaking of people getting injured with the Wiimotes, not everybody you see on the internet actually injured by a Wiimote is actually injured.
A lot of people are actually photoshopping their injuries with the Wiimotes as would the case be
with one that was posted here on Joystick showing how easily it can be done.
And I got to say, that's pretty sad when you got to do that too.
Yeah, if this is one of you people, if you're one of those people doing it, seriously, screw you.
You're not helping.
I mean, and I hope you don't get any attention from it.
I mean, it's one thing if it's to show off your art skills.
And if you say on it it's a fake or whatever, then fine.
Have fun with your Photoshop skills.
But for those people that are trying to pass it off as legitimate stuff, you know, seriously, screw you.
Because you're not helping.
You're the same people who are the stupid lame people who sell PS3s.
Why don't you make a sign that says pay attention to me?
Anyway.
Flip side of the argument is... Oh, by the way, Audio Archive folks, Drew Nami joined us during the bonus segment because they don't know you're here yet.
So, hi, Drew Nami.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
We can't go back to that subject.
We'll be here all night.
All right.
Well, how about some good news?
Yes, please.
Guess who's going to be heading to the virtual console?
Please say Kid Icarus.
Not yet.
Guardian Legend, Crystallis, Blaster Master.
Bible Adventure!
No.
Street Fighter 2, the World Warrior, is going to be heading to... Capcom finally loves us.
Another, though... But they love Japan more because it's already out over there.
Yeah, so what?
But a number of other games are going to be coming.
There's Kirby's Adventure, Pilotwings, Punch-Out, and hey, Rob, Kid Icarus.
Fuck yes, thank you.
So, but Capcom is starting to eke them out.
We love you, Capcom, sort of.
Hold on a minute.
If Street Fighter II comes out on Virtual Console, this will cost me $8, yes?
Yeah.
Could I not, for $2 more, get a version on Xbox that will allow me to play folks on Xbox Live, give me more features than the original Super Nintendo version did?
What if you don't own an Xbox?
Okay.
But that would be the only reason you should get this, then.
Because if you have an Xbox... Not everybody is in the same financial bracket or nerddom as us.
No, I understand that.
That's fine.
But I'm just saying, if you're in the... Let's say you're a Wii 60 person.
You have them both, okay?
Yeah.
Seriously, why would you buy this?
Why not?
Because you have a better version for $2 more on the 360.
Rob, I have it on MAME.
I have it on the Genesis.
Yeah, I do have it on Genesis.
I have it on the fucking Saturn.
And you'll buy this on Virtual Console?
Probably.
You sad, sad woman.
Rob, why would anyone buy Metal Slug?
Hey, we just got Metal Slug on Wii, okay?
I have Metal Slug on Wii.
I hope... Why would people buy horse turds?
Because they like the PlayStation 3.
Because they're large and smelly.
They like to feed them to their dogs.
Anyways.
Alright, well, I hope that game comes out soon.
Anyway, word is coming out that Nintendo has actually secretly this whole time been working...
on another Zelda title for the Wii.
This one that they were making on GameCube was going on and stuff, but this whole time, since the GameCube one's kind of been done for a little while, they just went back and made the Wii Handsmans, or whatever you want to call it.
It really does look like a GameCube game on the Wii.
Well, that there is another Zelda game, possibly sooner than you might think.
This whole rumor, by the way, being started by the latest issue of Game Informer Magnesine.
Very interesting.
I want to see another Wind Waker, to be honest.
I like the way it looked.
The cel-shading looked really good on the GameCube, and I think being that the Wii can't really push out too many high-res textures, that the cel-shaded way would be the way to go to make a really good-looking game.
So, hope for that!
Anyways.
Now, I mentioned, I think a few weeks ago, that I made a wireless sensor bar for my Wii, but of course...
If you don't want to go to Radio Shack and spend the $25 it takes to do that, you can spend a few more dollars, $31 after shipping and handling, and visit wirelesssensorbar.com, and you can purchase one made there for your Wii, and it uses basically a simple 9-volt battery.
It will give you 48 hours of wireless Wii play.
So interesting if you have, you know, projection TV, you know,
projection screen setup for your Wii definitely you're going to need something a little bit longer than the cord there so that might be the way to go or you can put two candles up and it works just as easy well speaking of other things for the Wii now this makes me particularly happy they are it's in the works right now to make a freeloader for the Wii for anyone who doesn't know
The Freeloader will basically allow you to play games from any region, basically, on your system.
I've got one for my GameCube.
Fabulous thing.
I've been playing lots of Naruto and Soul Calibur thanks to that.
And I have not yet tried my Freeloader on the Wii, because our Wii is sort of disconnected right now because we took it to someone's house.
But...
They don't have any date or price on it yet, but the quote is soon.
Soon.
That means I get my cooking, Mama.
It'll be done when it's done.
Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
I don't know how many folks have been importing Wii's from Europe just to play their games.
Because, you know, they got some stuff earlier than we did.
But one way or another, Europe has sold a lot of Wii's.
You know, it just recently launched over there this past week.
And they sold 325,000 Wii's in two days.
And, of course, just like here in the U.S., Zelda Twilight Princess being a big contributor there to the reason why these Wii's are flying off shelves.
at the retail price of £179.
By the way, that's $350 US.
And considering we can buy the system here for $250, once again, unfortunately, our friends overseas getting screwed a little bit on the price point.
Sorry, guys.
Don't know what to tell you.
So, there's some interesting stuff definitely about the Wii.
I know people that might not have wireless internet are kind of shit out luck unless you buy the Nintendo Wi-Fi adapter.
But,
Fear not, because someone's actually discovered that you can purchase a compatible USB Ethernet device from actual, like Newegg.
They're selling one for $19.99, and it's an Ethernet adapter that you can buy.
It's Keenamax USB 2.0 to RJ45 Fast Ethernet 10100 Base T Network Adapter.
That's a pretty long name there, but...
I thought my friend had this whole thing already
Nintendo already had this stuff out on the market, or is that just because the DS ones are already out there?
Well, that's a Wi-Fi Max.
That's that USB thing for wireless internet.
This actually plugs into your Wii and converts one of the USB ports to an Ethernet port.
Oh, okay, I get it.
So it works the other way.
Instead of plugging it into your computer, you plug it into the Wii.
I get it.
Well, this is not for a wireless internet.
This is wired internet.
It's just a converter.
Does it work if you have a USB router?
I don't know.
I don't know.
That's a good question.
Try it.
Find out.
Anyway, maybe when somebody at home tries that, they'll send us an email because we like to read emails every week here on this program.
Katie's distracted.
One of the things we pride ourselves on here at Orange Lounge Radio is that it's not just us because we're just some people on the Internet just like you, and we know you have an opinion as well, so we welcome it through the interactive elements of our program, and one of those is the mailbag.
DarkSakura opens up the mailbag every week and picks out some of our favorite emails and shares them with you in our little segment we call The Mailbag.
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
First email comes from our friend AZHP.
Hey, OLR.
I know how much you guys love analysts, and I came across this article called The Year Ahead in Tech by some research analysts.
A choice quote from it.
Remember, you can't spell analyst without anal.
Please do.
So...
And then that was the quote.
I would actually believe that.
How do people this stupid get jobs?
I would believe it.
Well, let me finish reading.
Please break these predictions down one by one and tell everyone how much of an idiot this guy is.
I would myself, but the email would get too long.
Love your show, AZHP.
Now, some of it... I honestly think Konami is going to stick with Sony because I think they have something.
However, being that you're seeing Solid Snake on Wii...
on a Wii game coming up, I have a feeling we might see a Metal Gear game on the Wii.
Or a game in the Metal Gear family.
I get the sense that Konami's willing to risk something on every platform, so I think they'll...
It'll be interesting to see what kind of happens with the whole Metal Gear thing, but I think you're going to see some PlayStation exclusives coming from Konami and some of the other big publishers.
But in regards to the whole thing about Microsoft taking down their... they would make online competitive play free for everyone, that's actually come up before, speculation-wise.
So this person's actually not saying anything new.
This whole thing started when Gold members started getting trailers earlier, demos earlier, and were like the only people that could participate in the Phantasy Star Universe beta.
Things of that nature have been making people talk that maybe gold is headed in a different direction for a while now.
So that's nothing new, actually.
I don't know if they can do that, though, because people get pissed off, especially if you're a retail store that's bought a bunch of these.
Xbox Live kits and stuff, and now you're shit out of luck with all this inventory.
I really don't think that it's going to go that way because you have to pay for maintaining the bandwidth.
I think that the gold membership will be part of how these services are paid for.
So I think the competitive play is going to stay on gold, and you're still going to have to pay for it.
You know, it would be interesting if gold would let you play online for the first three months, and then it's free afterwards.
That would be an interesting model, wouldn't it?
I don't know.
I don't think it would work.
Not in the long run.
These peanut butter cookies are delicious, might I say.
They are.
However, I think that they should do Guild Wars on Xbox and put that available for silver.
That's a strange suggestion, but I like it.
They're putting Final Fantasy XI on there.
Why the hell not?
It's not something I would have thought of otherwise, but I like it.
Well, I like that too because you don't have to pay an online service fee for that kind of game.
You just buy the game.
Yeah.
I think
I wish they'd have more free MMOs on there because that's what they really need to do.
I mean, there's not a lot of really good multiplayer games online that are like an MMO that you don't have to pay some monthly fee for.
And I think a lot of people would be looking for something like that.
Dear Gravity, put Ragnarok online on Xbox 360.
Dear Gravity, disregard what Jamie's telling you.
Dear Gravity, tell Rob to S-T-F-U-O-M-G.
So shall I move on to the next email?
Yes, please.
I love you, Rob.
Oh, really?
Yes, really.
Yeah, really?
Way.
Hey, OLR, JeremyTodd1 is here yet again.
Hooray.
Insert JeremyTodd1's theme song here.
He probably has one because he manages to get on this program through different ways many times.
No, it's all right.
He has a lot of good stuff to say.
I'm reading email.
I just made an Elebit noise.
So did she.
I haven't played Elebits yet.
Don't die.
I was thinking about this whole PS3 vs. Wii thing everyone is going off about and how Sony is partially relying on their brand name slash reputation to help sell the PS3.
Too true.
Well, I have an analogy.
An analogy also has the word anal in it.
Go back to the NES and Super Nintendo generations.
Everyone was talking about them and saying this is the system to get.
Nintendo's reputation was pretty much the status of a high school slutty cheerleader except better.
Everyone knew what Nintendo was.
Well, after those generations, look at Nintendo now.
They aren't exactly cheerleader worthy anymore, even though this could change this generation.
Could the same thing happen to Sony?
Just replace the NES of the PlayStation 1 and Super Nintendo with the PS2.
Could Sony's reputation break down faster than Loki's career after he gives his boss a death threat after playing GTA Vice City Stories?
He doesn't understand.
I could kick his ass any day.
And he knows it, so there's no problem there.
I could definitely see Sony's reputation dipping down quite a bit, just like Nintendo's did after the Super Nintendo.
They are already freaking headed that way.
So what do the world-famous hosts of Orange Zones Radio, www.orangezonesradio.com, think of this.
P.S.
Put an M in the middle of the P.S., and that's what Rob is going through right now.
Oh, snap for reals.
PMS3?
It's like some advanced form of PMS.
Like it's mute.
Drew Nami says it's PMS beyond.
Alright, anyway.
It's UPMS.
Uber PMS!
Yeah, but I think that Sony's already heading down the pooper.
In a way, it's tempting to make those type of comparisons, just like how everybody wanted to compare the 360 to the Dreamcast, right?
And there was a lot of, you know, remember way back when, when we were doing the separate program, one of the big stories in 2005 was the Xbox 360, people were comparing it to Dreamcast, and I think the 360's showing it's going to have a longer lifespan than Dreamcast, so it's tempting to make those comparisons based on all this circumstantial evidence.
And one could say that
Nintendo's big, big, big, big, big, big, big flaw they made with the Nintendo 64 that wrecked that system was the fact that they kept it cartridge-based and didn't go on to the CD and all that stuff.
And one could speculate that PS3's big, big, big mistake here is that they forced Blu-ray down everyone's throat.
But it's still too soon to tell.
The war ain't over yet.
Like I said, PlayStation 2 took me a while before I bought one.
So you never know what games might come out next year.
I don't understand.
How could Blu-ray fail?
I...
I actually liked Blu-ray, but I liked Betamax too, and what happened to that?
Bastards.
You know what's funny?
Price aside, UMD's not bad either.
Price aside.
That's the one problem I have with UMD.
But now you get a tower while they're closing all their stores and get them for a dollar.
That's a good idea.
Okay, next one comes up from Misty.
Hey everyone, what's up?
Misty here.
Thanks to the Podline's service, I caught part of the December 3rd episode around 1am December 5th, St.
Louis time, of course, because I was up anyway.
Like usual on my days off from work, I slept quite late.
Amen to that.
I made it to the library before dark, but combined the fact that I'm in the middle of catching up on downloading the podcast and the fact that I only got an hour and a half online for the visit, it's no wonder that I didn't get to listen to the rest of the episode on my borrowed computer.
Yes, I am actually working on getting a computer again.
With a combination of the game center, the crib, and the library to get online, I was mostly alright for getting online.
Heck, I was even able to listen live for about 45 minutes on Sunday nights for the most part.
With that gone, though, and with my transfer slash hour switch, I seem to have very little time online because most days for me seem to involve closing.
That tends to get me out about midnight or 1am, depending on the day, being too wired, for lack of a better word, and not falling asleep until sunrise and sleeping as late as I can before having to repeat it the next afternoon.
I can sympathize with that.
I definitely plan to have a computer and a laptop by the time I go to my usual anime convention, Anime Central, which is May 11th through 13th this time around.
Aren't you going to ASUN?
Chris will be at ASIN I will be there representing Orange Lounge Radio sweet she's got some promo cards in April we'll talk that's where the rest of this email is heading that reminds me the convention talk is about the last thing I can recall from listening from pod lines from my cell phone
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yeah, unfortunately, it's just a cost thing, because remember, we don't get paid for doing this program, so we don't have a travel budget like your pals at Ziff Davis and other publishing houses do.
Hey, folks who run ASIN, send me a ticket.
I'll come out and do the panel.
But Chris is going out of the goodness of her heart, because she's already going for other stuff, so if we can't make it, she will be our official Orange Lounge representation.
I will go there, and I will hand out lots of flyers.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
By the way, I also want to mention what Misty refers to, the Podline service.
Now, we don't support this.
This is another organization, but I will give it a shout-out.
Apparently, there's a service where you can listen to Orange Launch Radio over the telephone by calling this number.
One for long distance.
Area code 650.
523-6855.
Keep in mind, that's not an official endorsement of the service.
We don't know much about them.
All we know is that apparently they let you listen to podcast feeds over the telephone.
So use at your own risk.
It's podlines.net.
But it's kind of neat that we're able to get the show out there to folks who maybe don't have an iPod, things like that, where they can't listen to the show on the go.
It's easier access to a computer 24-7.
So that's kind of neat.
This next email, I shouldn't read it because DMN's not in the chat room tonight, you bastard.
But I'll read it anyway.
Dude, I'm drunk, I love you, Rob.
My girlfriend loves you, too.
Seriously, DMN.
DMN needs a cookie.
DMN, you need to be like Lindsay Lohan and check yourself in AA, okay?
That's all I have to say.
Here's the next step.
Yeah, be Lindsay Lohan, put a shirt on, too.
and like Britney Spears, put some panties on.
Yes, please DM him, put some panties on.
That woman's cooch is not attractive, I'm sorry.
Anyway, that's a harken back to guys on the show.
Plug, plug, plug.
Thank you.
Anyway, this one comes from Michael.
Long time listener, first time emailer.
I've enjoyed the song Flotation all the way back from when I first played 2DX6 style, and the vocal mix she played sometime is fantastic.
However, after about two years of trying, I can't find it anywhere.
I know MP3 requests are frowned upon, but I'm desperate to hear any chance you could help.
There is a Vincent D'Amour compilation that's got Flotation, Green Heaven, Fly Away, all of those on it.
Some of the Dance Manias do.
So I would suggest looking for some of those compilations.
Yeah, because we can't really endorse the whole MP3 thing, but if you come by on a Wednesday night in the chat room, maybe I'll hook you up.
But I didn't say that.
But seriously though, we would encourage that you get the originals.
Go CD Japan, go to some of the... In fact, I remember seeing on one of the Transnation CDs...
I think it was the Transnation, either the 2003 or 2004 edition.
04 has quite a number of really good trans stuff on it, and one of them is Flotation.
Was it Flotation, or was it Fly Away?
The Flotation 2000 mix, that's actually a really good one.
I used to have that CD until someone stole it out of my car!
And the last one... No, wait, god damn it, Rob left the room.
Okay, okay, okay, I'll read another one.
This actually was sent to us by our friend Rob with two B's.
It was a story from a blog that he sent us that
This will make sense to the podcast listeners, but now I am starting to see dropout errors on our end, and I don't know if that's Live 365 fault or our fault, so I was just saying in studio, if anyone's doing any downloads or big transfers, those gotta get pulled, because I don't know what's going on.
It could be Comcast, it could be a number of things, so sorry about that, guys.
I lost the email, so I'll go to a different one that he sent us, because he sent me several.
Sorry to run out, but I was getting the messages we were dropping out.
Gamasutra posted... posted...
A story about Activision.
It's the NIMF E-grade given to ESRB.
Let me just pull up the story real quick because it's actually pretty interesting.
Activision survey finds strong parental support for the ESRB.
It's a really good article and I'm going to link it in the chat room.
Basically, parents support the ESRB.
They think it's a good idea.
It certainly makes their jobs a little bit better, I think.
It makes it easier for them to
Be able to judge what their children are playing.
I think it's a good idea.
Now this last one is interesting.
I'm going to read it.
And Rob has to pay attention.
Maybe I should let Chris read it.
No.
Okay.
The whole point was for you to read it.
Damn it.
This was sent to us by Chris.
Hi guys, it's me, Chris.
I'm a big lesbian.
I did not say that.
It's true, but I didn't say that.
You people sure attract some weirdos.
Some guy showed up at my house with a red suit on, riding in a sleigh.
He asked me to send you this email.
Dear OLR crew, You wrote ORL?
He wrote ORL.
Oh, really?
It was the guy.
Yeah, on your laptop.
Good evening, OLR.
Oh, and good evening, chat room.
I hope all have had a wonderful holiday season so far.
It was brought to my attention by my elves working in the wishes room that they detected a strange anomaly.
It seems hundreds of wishes have been piling in all for your radio show, hoping for the best in the new year.
Well, this had me perplexed on how to help, as wishes are my specialty.
After a while, it came to me.
I gathered all the wishes from your fans to create one gift that I hope... that all hope will be of use...
to help your show.
Sorry.
From the wishes of the chat room to the wishes of the message board to the wishes of the listeners not known, I'll have a very special gift for you.
To Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, happy holidays and a wonderful new year from SC.
P.S.
I left the gift with a strange blue-haired girl.
She should be handing it to you right now.
And you have to open it.
Oh my.
People attract the weirdest of guys.
Oh my.
This guy was old.
That's Rob that attracted me.
You know what's funny is that she started to mention this encounter off air and I said, was he hot?
Some strange man came to the door talking about the radio show and the first question I go, was he hot?
Oh no, you like the old dude?
Rob likes it.
Am I okay to open this?
Yeah, you have to open it.
Go for it.
It's an envelope, two OLR from Santa and the fans.
Oh, I licked it, sorry.
Do you have an oil fixation?
Yeah.
Hurry up, Rob!
I'm trying, I don't want to ruin it.
Yes, please.
Rob pulls the thing apart, maiming the envelope, the poor defenseless thing.
Chris, I... I didn't do it.
Santa did.
I... Like, I'm just, like, not paying attention to anything.
I'm actually looking... I don't know what to say.
I'm... Wow.
That whole guy was cool.
Are you sure?
I don't know what to say.
This is embarrassing in a way.
Apparently this old guy gave us a location to where he killed Rob's family and left their bodies.
So he's...
Can I say what it is?
I guess you could call it...
I'm throwing it around the whole place.
I guess you could call it seed money to take OLR to the next level.
And something I think a lot of us always, like we always kind of thought to take this to the next level.
It was always... No, I'm sorry.
I'm just overwhelmed.
Bandit's on the right track.
You're on the right track, I'll put it that way.
It's basically $4,000 in scene money.
It sounds so strange to say.
Just to bring you guys to do what we do here and really be able to take this to the next level.
Oh god, I'm so embarrassed that
I'm calling your girlfriend and asking her permission to service you.
I just, I didn't, I wanted to do something really nice for you guys.
I mean, I didn't get to be all emotional, but you guys have done a lot for me that I haven't, that I didn't know how to reciprocate, and you guys are always talking about you guys want to do all of this stuff, and I thought that this was the best way to show you that I could do that.
and, you know, it's for promotion.
It's for anything you guys want to use it for.
Completely at your disposal.
Thank you so much.
I don't know where to begin.
I don't know where to begin.
Now it's kind of like that I'm looking at this.
I'm like, I don't know.
I don't know where to begin.
I think we need to set up that account now.
I think maybe setting up the work account would be a good idea now and maybe...
Maybe we'll be coming to a city near you after all sometime soon.
Who knows?
I don't know.
But thank you so much.
I'm... Thank you.
Are you okay, Loki?
I'm not even looking at chat.
I don't even want to know.
They're all by allgames.com.
I don't think that's going to be happening.
Bandit's telling us to drop by 365.
Uh...
That's never been a possibility before, but now maybe it is.
My heart's racing very quickly.
I know.
I'm so sorry for making a complete ass of... No, it's fine.
It's fine.
I just don't know what to say.
I mean, this just doesn't happen.
But it is.
I know.
I know.
I just don't know what to say.
Read another fucking email already.
That was the last email.
God damn it.
Read another one.
Make something up.
Make something up.
Dear Jamie, I think that you should rule my country.
Love, The Queen.
You play everything on Doctor Who.
All you would play is Doctor Who.
We'd have like BBC Who.
Anyways, I'll take it from here.
Please do.
If I had a story up, somebody else needs to do it.
I'm sorry.
Exchange Mii's.
There's a way, apparently if you transfer your Mii to your remote, which you can do via the Wii console, you can then log into a website for a Mii exchange.
It's actually available on wimodwii.com, that's W-I-I-M-O-D-W-I-I, and slash Mii's.
Ace Ventura, Albert Einstein, Hitler, Chuck Norris, Chewbacca, Dr. Evil, Dr. Phil, W. Bush, etc.
God, Harry Potter.
So definitely check that out.
Of course, you're going to need a program to be able to transfer that.
And available also on WeModWe.com, you can get the Wii Transfer Station, which will allow you to do that.
And it gives you instructions on how to set that up as well.
So definitely worth checking out.
I need to get a USB Bluetooth thing so I can actually do this, because I've got to have Chuck Norris on my Wii console.
That is a requirement.
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and try to do the next story.
and then I'm going to run out of the room for a minute.
Anyway, something else that almost drove me to tears when I heard about it was the announcement of Dragon Quest IX coming to the Nintendo DS.
Square Enix held a press conference to talk about the new Dragon Quest game earlier this week and the big shock, you know, nobody was surprised that Dragon Quest IX is coming out.
Hell, these games are like of biblical proportions in Japan.
But the fact that Dragon Quest IX Protectors of the Starry Sky would actually be coming to Nintendo DS was quite a bit of a surprise.
It will feature 3D graphics.
There were some screenshots released.
It looks very similar in style to Dragon Quest VIII, which was, of course, recently out on the PlayStation 2.
And they are trying to make it ready by 2007.
By the way, Square Enix is also making a card-based arcade.
Excuse me.
Not only am I crying, but I have hiccups, too.
Dragon Quest Monster Battle Road
I've pretty much stripped down all the DS games I have to New Super Mario Bros.
and Mario Kart.
I don't really play anything else on my PSP, but there's really not a lot of must-have games.
It's just a lot of filler, it seems like.
A lot of ports of stuff that end up on the PSP, but nothing that's just like, wow, a new Dragon Quest game, or Final Fantasy.
I think that's why their system is not doing this well.
Airtost says Silent Hill Origins.
Yeah, whenever that comes out.
Instead we just have, yay, another Untold Legends, or yay, another Dynasty Warriors, yay.
GS191, breaking news, Japan covered in white substance after announcement of Dragon Quest IX for DS.
Enis is going to sue somebody now.
So I don't know what else to say about that.
I was pretty surprised to hear that myself.
I don't know.
I'm so used to playing Dragon Quest on my television.
But then again, if you think about it, they did have Dragon Quest on the Game Boy years ago.
I mean, they ported one, too.
And there will be a Dragon Quest Swords coming out on the Wii.
Oh, I forgot about that.
That's right.
That was supposed to be a launch title.
I think it was in Japan.
All right.
Well, I definitely want to check this out.
I mean, I'm liking the Final Fantasy III on the DS.
I don't see any... Dragon Quest graphical style, I think, will translate very well to the DS.
I don't see why this will be a problem.
Toriyama.
You can't go wrong with him.
I think it'll be good.
And also, that means the really bad voice acting won't be in it.
Which is good news.
Call Blimey!
Anyways, so now...
Bringing you further information of what the Mac can do as far as gaming for you guys, I thought I'd bring this up.
You can use, using a Mac, a Wii, and a certain program, you can make your Wii sound like a lightsaber when you swing it around.
Apparently there's a program that's out there right now, and why someone created this, for the tilt sensor that's in the Mac laptop, so you know, to prevent
Star Wars Kid
WeSaber.
Heaven help us all.
Well, how about I redeem the world now?
Please do.
Well, everybody, I'm sure if you listen to our show, you have to be pretty cool so you know who Kevin Smith is.
Yes.
Um... Nugget of the Nooch!
That... Well, he's interested in making a game based on Jay and Silent Bob.
Um...
To quote, games in one field that I like to be entertained rather than try to be entertaining, basically stating that he'd come up with the concept and story if someone else would make the levels and stuff in it.
So he basically is going to be concept director.
Welp.
rated M for Mature rated M for Mature
And that's great.
So she had Dogma the game.
We have to... That'd be awesome.
We have to fight legions of angels.
And with Alanis as God.
Do we get to watch Muse strip?
We are not going to watch him do the Silence of the Lambs dance.
No, Muse.
Serendipity!
Oh, I thought you meant... Selma Hayek, man!
Okay, I thought you were talking about Jason Mewes because they referred to him by his last name in their interviews.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
The Mewes.
Serendipity, yeah.
Oh, hell yeah!
Boobies!
Well... Boobies!
You know what?
Jay and Silent Bob would be a pretty sweet video game and I think there would be a collective nerdgasm heard around the world with this type of game.
Oh my god.
Seriously.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
After all, they have the ticket games based off the Titanic, so that's not as bad, I guess.
No singing, no karaoke revolution tie-ins, just something else big and ugly to stick in my arcade to attract all the little rugrats who are celebrating somebody's birthday.
To quote DJ Dark Knight, No!
And also, to go back on a previous subject, to quote Gary Who Drive Car, Mallrats the game removed the kids sitting on the escalator level.
Well, while Jay and Silent Bob the video game may be a great thing, certainly this American Idol news of an American Idol game makes us very angsty because we think about the great arcade machines, you know, the Soul Calibur 3s that could be in these arcades, the Time Crisis 4s, the DDR Supernovas that will be taken out in favor of American Idol.
And does this piss you off as much as it does us?
Because it makes us so mad we have to...
Rant.
The FUs of the week, DarkSakura.
The first FU of the week goes to Extrovert.
For not letting us buy him the intimate celebrity photo shoot butt bleaching.
We were going to get Extrovert a gift certificate for intimate photographs.
And an anal bleaching.
That fell through.
I would, however, like to say that that conversation at TGI Fridays elicited the most beautiful facial responses from my husband.
It was gorgeous.
Watching Dan squirm makes me happy sometimes.
All right.
Loki, your FU.
My FU goes to stupid people, and especially the amounts of stupid people out in abundance due to the holidays.
You know, I hate having to drive around and see you trying to, you know,
Swerve into me and then realize, oh, you're just trying to change lanes, but you haven't figured out how to use the blinker yet.
Stupid shit like that.
Oh, and this one's definitely for Nelly.
Fuck you to the stupid grandma that brought her daughter to the Dollar Tree so that she could buy candy and had to count out her $4 worth of purchases with pennies in front of us.
And she kept messing up.
and have to recount them.
It was horrible.
That's why you get paper rolls first.
When I was in college, we used to save up all of our pennies in a semester and then roll them and then go to movies.
She saved them in grandma's medicine little bottles.
Oh, no, I know the rules.
I hope you don't mind me paying for the pennies.
Well, then we used to put them all in a gallon milk jar and then we'd count them out before we went where we were going.
See, that's what considerate people would do, but you forget she's a dumb bitch.
Um...
I had something, but I kind of forgot it amongst everything else that's been going on.
So, no, it's fine.
Trust me.
But I guess my FU would have to go to myself for crying like a little bitch on the radio program.
Oh, sorry.
I am so sorry, Rob.
No, no, no.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Don't feel sorry.
I had a serious FU, and I seriously... Oh, I know what it was.
I just remembered.
I finally remembered.
An FU to the fact I didn't go to bed until 6.30 in the morning yesterday.
Because that's my own downfall, but it doesn't make me feel any better.
Because my Sunday is, like, completely gone.
Oh, wait.
Oh, shh.
Hello.
We still have other people that have to do their FUs.
Drew.
Drew.
First off, FU to the World of Warcraft 2.0 patch for forcing me into the addiction relapse.
FU to certain parts of that patch that break all your interface add-ons.
When we say, remember, remember the 5th of December, the day all the add-ons were dropped.
and F.U.
to not having my chat filter up until a week afterwards forcing me to actually deal with the dude speaking that is in WoW also F.U.
to Burnout 3 which is on loan right now for being so incredibly addictive that's it alrighty Chris, you have some F.U.s of the week?
I've only got one and that's F.U.
to Fred Seltz and the West Baptist Church
All you people need to, like, shut the fucking hell up.
I mean, I don't know if you guys know who the Phelps crowd is.
They are, like, the biggest retard, inbred retards I've ever come across.
Not only do they hate gay people, that, you know, that's kind of a given.
Most, you know, church-based organizations do that.
But they've got signs out there that say, you know, God hates fags, thank God for AIDS, that kind of shit.
They also protest.
at soldiers' funerals.
I don't care how much you like this war or not.
You do not protest at dead soldiers' funerals, you fucking retards.
And didn't they protest the Amish, too?
They protested, okay.
How can anyone hate the Amish?
They protested, I'm sure all of you heard, some little girls got killed by this insane guy.
And the little girls were Amish.
Four little girls got killed.
In a schoolhouse.
In a schoolhouse.
This guy came and was gonna, you know, just kill them.
He was going to rape them.
The bastards were going to protest at an Amish, little girl Amish funeral.
How can you, no one hates the Amish.
What are they going to do?
You know, knit a quilt at you?
Yeah, really.
I mean, oh my God.
You know when that happened, the Amish set up a fund for the murderer's family.
Yeah, family.
Who hates the Amish?
They were going to have signs out there that were going to say your daughters are whores.
They're burning in hell.
You do not do that.
You are a human being, goddammit.
You treat people with fucking respect.
Out there if you hate homosexuals.
You do not go to a little girl's funeral.
and, you know, protest that kind of shit.
Especially the Amish.
Mentally ill people.
I mean, the Amish don't have, you know, I'm sure they keep up to date with some stuff, but it's not like they have a big scope of the world out all the frickin' time.
What is there, the Westminster Batmobile?
Uh, West...
Baptist Church.
If you don't believe us, check this site out.
GodHatesFags.com.
Yeah, it's very interesting.
It's disgusting.
Well, I mean, if you watch them... I don't take it seriously.
I don't take it seriously.
These people are seriously ill.
Yeah, you should... Here's something fun.
Type in Phelps or go to GodHatesFags.com and you can find his name.
Go put that shit on YouTube.
Shirley Phelps is his wife.
Like, the guy...
Fox News Interviews with Shirley Phelps.com
She obviously hasn't read the Bible.
Yeah, seriously.
And she looks like she got hit with a shovel, too.
It's like... We've got to get back to games.
I'm sorry, I went a little overboard.
They struck a chord in me.
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Fuck you, Phelps.
Jesus loves you, so worship him or he'll kill you.
To quote Chris.
To quote Junami, Jesus saves, everybody else takes half damage.
I love D&D geek jokes.
Anyways.
So, hey, Loki, what do you say we continue on with some stories?
Yes.
So, if you don't have enough money to spend on a PlayStation 3 or, you know, a 360 or even a Wii for that matter, what can you do?
What can you do?
Well, you can buy retro.
And, you know, for the same amount of money, why bother buying virtual console games when you can actually have the original console that was played on?
So, shop eBay.
Shop your local thrift stores.
Find those old consoles and find the games for even cheaper.
Hell, if you're in the California area here, go visit Tower or Hell.
I think they're all around the country, but visit Tower Records.
They're closing down, so you can probably get some old-ass games there if they have some used stuff.
But yeah, eBay is your friend.
You can find lots of consoles for cheap, especially when people are trying to earn some extra money to buy the new ones.
I like eBay.
eBay's been taking a lot of my money lately.
Well, something that hasn't taken a lot of my money in a long time is the Atari 7800.
The system that is most notoriously known for breaking!
You can have a working AC adapter, those are pretty hard to come by too, but the systems?
No.
No, no, no, no.
Out of five that I've played, all of them broke.
So, yeah.
But, some people have decided that it's a good idea to put a new game out on the 7800.
We have Pac-Man Collection.
For the 7800.
And again, the 7800 is a good system, don't get me wrong.
But it's a bunch of homebrew games that were compiled by Bob DeCrescendo.
And it includes Pac-Man, Puck-Man, Hangley-Man, which is the best name ever.
Ultra Pac-Man, Random Mazes Ms.
Pac-Man, Ms.
Pac-Attack and Ms.
Random Mazes has a full color manual you can play it in plus or fast mode which is alternate play options Junior Pac-Man and Super Pac-Man are both missing and it's a $30 package there is let's see there's apparently a link on AtariAge.com you can find it there
A new Pac-Man for a system nobody plays anymore.
Be still, my fleeting heart.
I actually... Or nobody wants to play because it breaks so goddamn much.
Last year we did by Super Pac-Man for... Sorry, Ms.
Pac-Man for the 5200, the prototype.
Oh, that's a 5200.
I know.
Well, I love 5200.
5200's freaking rad.
It has kicks on it.
Well, too bad my Atari 7800 is five times broken.
Everybody's is broken.
No, but you know what?
For somebody who's like an old school gaming collector type thing, they are going to be just simply amazed at this, you know?
And I kind of think... I pick it up.
I think it's cool that people would put the effort into something like this, you know?
Tease this game all you want, but just the fact that there is so much love for Atari out there that somebody would put something like this together, it's pretty rad.
It's pretty rad.
Anyway...
What's not so rad is Nintendo having to do these programs recently.
We talked about the strap thing earlier in the show.
Well, they also, this is a full-fledged recall.
In Japan, not here, but 200,000 AC adapters for the DS and DS Lights have been recalled overseas.
Keep in mind that things plug in differently over there than they do over here, so this news does not affect us here in the
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
or, you know, Xboxes causing home fires or, you know, stuff like that.
But now, people are worried that Wi-Fi might actually be killing you because the waves it uses causing some sort of brain damage or stuff like that.
Why would people actually think this?
I mean, that's like thinking that the Earth is flat or that, I don't know, that the...
Earth, or the sun revolves around the Earth, and vice versa.
People are stupid.
This is why people fling remotes at the TV, because they're retarded.
They'll believe this shit.
You know what?
I swear to God, when this, that whole story with the Wii remotes, you know, them offering the extra thick strap for the Wii remote...
So many people at my work came up to me and go, have you heard they're recalling those remotes because they keep breaking things, and blah, blah, blah, blah.
This is a good cross-section of the people of the United States, you know, the people I work with right here, and they're all idiots.
So, you know, they just, unfortunately, they were, you know, getting the story spun by, you know, God knows what news program.
Gears of War
and that's one million in the U.S.
alone.
It's the fastest selling next gen console game with lots of death and shooting and killing and bomb shelters.
But basically there was an official press release put out about this just stating that
that it's basically the quote on here from Jeff Bell, who's the corporate vice president of global marketing for interactive entertainment business at Microsoft Corporation, was saying, Gears of War has clearly won the battle for the title of must-have game of the year.
Its phenomenal success is one of many reasons why Xbox 360 is the ultimate place to get together with friends to play this holiday.
We've always had high hopes for Gears of War, but we never expected such an overwhelmingly positive response from critics and gamers all over the world.
That's a quote from Michael Capps at Epic Games.
So, that's pretty cool.
And it also said another fun stat on Xbox Live that the total of gameplay sessions online reached 10 million and unlocked 7 million achievements.
Oh my gosh.
And I have two of those.
Paid registrations on Xbox Live have gone over 50% more since the game has launched.
Wow.
All right.
Well, I know you guys have been dying to want to call into the show.
It's been a very interesting night tonight, to say the least.
It's kind of like our... What did we keep threatening to do last year?
Were we going to do a Christmas in Compton special or something like that?
It's certainly been a very interesting evening.
If we were going to want to do something that we already have a theme song, we could do, you know, Christmas in Hollis.
What's that song that Eazy-E did?
Christmas in Compton?
That's it.
It was Christmas in Compton.
All right.
Well, Run DMC did Christmas in Hollis.
All right.
Well, anyway, we got to get to the voicemail of the week.
We've got to play this real quick.
A voicemail here that was left us by a listener.
We didn't get a lot of voicemails this week.
I'm very disappointed.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
And there's stuff to give away this week, too.
So you want to leave us your Sony commercial.
And if you don't know what the heck we're talking about, go to Part A. Here's the voicemail of the week.
Hi there.
This is Apollo.
And I was just listening to last week's podcast when you guys were talking about the point system for the week.
on downloading games.
And I wanted to note that I actually do have to pay tax.
I live in Nashville, Tennessee, and when I buy points online with my credit card, it does charge tax.
Just thought it would be an interesting note.
You guys later.
Love the show.
Bye.
Interesting.
So we have yet to really hear... Thank you for the voicemail, by the way.
We have yet to really hear how this whole tax thing breaks down, because we know those of us in California aren't paying the tax on the Wii points, but now we know Tennessee, our listener here, Pennsylvania, and probably some other states are charging.
Very interesting how that's all breaking down.
Not a whole lot said on that.
It is a transaction.
You are paying for a service, so it's sensible.
At the same time, there's just a little bit of it that seems bizarre to me.
Wow.
I'd kind of be curious to know, like, do you get taxed on Xbox points, too?
That would be kind of what I'd be wondering about, so.
Paradox Vincent What's on your mind, buddy?
I just got Beatmania 2DX Happy Sky Well, I got the limited edition and I really liked that Everything that packaged together was really nice
I haven't got a chance to watch the DVD yet because I don't have a region free but the game itself the skin for it I'd say is a great improvement over anything they've ever done and I like the fact that you can change the music when you're selecting the song my only gripe would really be the new difficulty setting but I haven't really gotten used to
to grading them by 12 instead of 8.
Oh, yeah, because that was new in Happy Sky, right?
Basically, I can only play on 7 on 2EX Red, and there was a really big gap between really easy 7 songs and really hard 7 songs.
That's about where I'm at, yep.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's been pretty much split down between 7 and 8 difficulty now.
The song list itself, though, I was really happy with.
And my biggest complaint about the songs would be the difficulty of May and Zephyr, which were my two favorite songs.
And they're nearly impossible on 7Key and another.
but on light mode they're just too easy.
Interesting.
So there's too much of a gap in the difficulty there.
In some songs there's a giant gap in difficulty.
I think Blue Mirage was another one of those.
Overall I was really happy with it.
That's good.
One other quick question I have for you then we've got to move on to some other calls.
What would you say you would like to see Konami do if they put out
Beatmania 13 or Beatmania Distorted out on the console what would you like to see them what do they need to most improve on with their next release most improve on with the next release hmm I stumped you I don't I'm yeah I'm really happy with the Beatmania system and you can't really change the note charts would you like to see an edit mode or something I don't know
edit mode where maybe like not necessarily you get to put the notes wherever you want but you can key map them however you want might be interesting if they can make it work that might be interesting I'd say add something new because they have customized now they have class mode they have all these modes and I would really like to see them add some kind of new thing long long mixes might be kind of cool too
Alright, we'll see.
I've got to let you go, ParadoxVincent, but thanks so much for the call.
Have a great week, alright?
Thanks for the review.
Thanks for the review of Beatmania 2DX Happy Sky.
Let's go to another call here on the Skype line.
and you can call us again 877-GAME-OLR or username Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
I hope you know that you've pulled me away from a very important Zelda party to be here.
Hello, Megzy.
Long time no see.
Hi!
Hi!
Because, okay, where do I start?
First of all, Nintendo makes high quality stuff.
They wouldn't make faulty straps, I don't think.
And second, if you're throwing your Wiimote so hard that the strap's going to break, then you are abusing it in the first place.
You work at a game store, right?
Have you heard customers complaining about this at all?
I've heard people, people have like come up and asked me like, so I heard that all the Wiimotes are recalled, is that true?
And I haven't heard anyone say like, my strap broke or something like that.
So it's just a big, it's like a big game of telephone gone crazy.
Pretty much.
I have to ask this, what exactly do you do at a Zelda party?
Without pants.
Play Zelda and play the song by System of a Down.
Without pants.
Without pants.
Do you eat, like, tortilla chips and call them Triforces?
Oh, hells yeah.
Okay, I was curious what other little themed things you could do.
The Triforce of Dorito.
Okay.
Cooler Ranch, The Wind.
By the way, Megzie, since we're not doing a show next week, we wish you happy birthday on air.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, I sang to you and you weren't there to hear it.
You want me to do it again?
I'm sorry.
I can do it again.
Yes, I want to hear it again.
Happy birthday, Megzie.
Happy birthday to you.
What's going to be the party on your birthday, Megzie?
Are you going to have a Princess Peach party or...?
Kind of.
Well, then I better not elaborate on that.
This is a family show.
Any other thoughts?
Any other thoughts for our listeners, Megzi?
Phoenix Wright 2 should be out right now because Franziska von Karma is hot.
Loki says January.
January 16th.
For some reason you put Drew in a giggle fit and he's curled up in a ball.
Are you okay?
He's gone fetal.
And he's headbanging on the floor.
Did you ever see Screamers?
Alright, I'll see you in two weeks, baby.
Alright, I'll see you then.
Bye, Maisie.
Have fun at the Zelda party.
Alright.
Let's go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
I'm sorry!
No, I'm good.
I made a little potty break while Jamie and Matt were doing some stories and I'm good now.
I'm sorry, I don't know why, I was just overcome with a lot at once, so it was something else.
Better to be overcome than, sorry.
That's debatable.
That's debatable.
Anyway, sorry Ranma, what's on your mind?
Did we lose him?
Is he there?
I wanted to touch up on the whole thing about the brick consoles, you know, these things on the
Oh, the connection's bad, Ranma.
I'm so sorry.
You're spending this much money for a system?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Ranma.
We can't understand a damn thing you're trying to say.
It says something about the brick consoles.
Let's speculate.
What was Ranma trying to say about the brick consoles, you think?
You should try to build a house out of Xbox 360s.
Raven's Dolphin, how are you?
You're not Ranma, go away!
No, it's fine.
We'll take your perspective.
What's up, dude?
You sure?
You sure?
Yes, what's up?
We want to know.
I just want to tell you, it's just been such a lovely year.
Listening to OLR, we found you on PST Drive, September.
I forget what day, but it's been great.
Yeah, I mean, you won the Wii, so you had a really good year in Orange Tops Radio-wise, didn't you?
Yeah.
What was your favorite gaming moment?
He didn't say that very convincingly.
Bandit's telling us to hang up.
Do you have a rebuttal?
Yeah, no, don't listen to the chat room.
Yeah, Bandit said that I'm a quitter in chat, so Bandit can kiss my ass.
Yeah, the Wii was alright.
No, I'm kidding.
Ravensoft, what was the best gaming moment of 2006?
The best gaming moment of 2006 was actually winning that Wii.
I was
So you would say your favorite moment of, oh, that's a good number one and two.
Number one is winning the Wii.
Number two is Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
What?
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
I'm going to turn around and smack you.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
With this seed money, I'm going to buy a big orange bat to clobber her with when she starts that shit.
I just got one of those off eBay.
You just bought a rocket launcher?
I want a rocket launcher!
Oh, it's a USB rocket launcher on eBay.
All right, yes, Raven Stolfen.
I just want to say, yeah, that is drunken rage.
It lives on.
DMN is not even here and his tail's between his legs somewhere else.
I don't know what to say.
He's drunk fapping on the internet.
I don't know where he is.
He's drunk in a pod somewhere.
He's drunk fapping on the internet.
Alright, Raven's Dolphin, we gotta let you go to get to some more calls.
We appreciate it, though, and hope you have a good week.
Bye, guys.
Everyone else there, bye.
Alright, let's go to this call.
I think this might be Ranma on the cell phone.
Oh, can I even pick up another call?
Why is it a little... Aw, damn it.
That's all right.
Well, fine.
We'll go to someone else.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is Solar Wing.
Hi, Solar Wing.
What's on your mind?
Solar Wing, I'm sorry.
I thought you said celery.
Sorry.
Celery's good for you.
It's a good thing.
Solar Wing, what's on your mind?
We wish traps.
How can people even think that they would break?
Well, because they have been.
No, they haven't.
Well, the Wii straps, yes, have broken, but it's due to people's stupidity that they're breaking, we assume.
Not that they're in volition.
It may be a few fluke circumstances that doesn't happen, but yeah.
Right.
I don't own one yet, but I will be getting one.
And I tried it.
I could not break it.
I tried.
I know.
I've been kind of, like, ever since I've been reading these stories, I've been, like, kind of trying to break mine, and you can't.
I don't know how people do it.
Well, what are you going to be getting when you get your Wii?
What kind of games do you want to get with it?
Of course, the classic Zelda.
Elibits, I want to try that.
Elibits is pretty fun.
It's a good game.
All right, well, good luck to you on your Wii quest, and please don't break any Wii straps.
We don't want an Orange Lounge listener to be the first Wii casualty.
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, buddy?
Just happy holidays to you guys.
Thank you so much.
Same to you.
I hope you have a good holiday, and I hope you get a wee under your tree.
That would be fun.
Oh, yeah.
All right.
Thanks.
Good luck.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
All right.
Let's go to one more call here, and I think it's this one that I want.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's Ron.
I finally made it back on my cell phone.
Finally.
All right.
What the hell were you saying about brick consoles?
My thing is this.
If you're spending so much money on these consoles...
It wouldn't kill you to drop an extra 20 or 30 bucks on the extended warranty.
That way, if it does happen, instead of having to go through the rigmarole of shipping out your unit, go to the store, get it exchanged, you come back, you're back gaming within the hour.
Let me tell you what I hate about the extended warranty thing, though.
It's not the warranty itself, but it's the fact that these things are always trying to be shoved down my throat.
And I'm one of those people that's like when somebody tells me I have to get something or I need it, I'm like, no.
I know exactly how you mean it.
I mean, I do this for a living.
I sell cameras and
and laptops and stuff, I tell people about the warranty and I tell them the positives about it, you know?
I tell them, hey, you don't have to get it though, it's just a piece of mind.
I completely understand.
I never force something like that down anyone's throat, you know?
Well, it's all about the way you sell it, but granted, all those pros were brought to you by your management and you probably have to do that to some extent, right?
Yeah, but I still do it from any other store, but the thing is, I tell people from my own personal experience is because I've been doing this for a very long time.
Fair enough, fair enough.
I mean, but you know, I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm kind of finding the basic warranty is usually enough to cover me because if it's faulty, it's going to break in the first few days.
But I can understand why people are about the extended warranty, but I don't know.
I guess you just have to make your own informed decision based on your needs.
And to Funnydale, it does cover that, okay?
No, Funnydale says the extended warranty won't help pay off all the doctor's bills.
Well, he says it won't help to replace the $5,000 on TV, but the right warranty will, you know.
All right.
Ranma, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for calling us back.
All right.
No problem.
Happy holidays.
Bye.
Do you have something for Ranma?
No.
Oh, all right.
Bye, Ranma.
Sorry, Ranchan.
I'll tell you when you're here in town.
She'll give it to you later.
No, not like that.
But I have something to play for people because this is what's on my mind about work tomorrow.
You know what's sad is probably a lot of people don't even get it.
That's right.
A lot of people do.
A lot of people do, I'm sure.
That's fine.
No, I get it, but I had to have it explained to me.
All right.
Anyhow, this is the part of the show where we ask for any last-minute stories, boys and girls.
I have a story.
Yes.
My story has to do with a baseball player.
The pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, Joel Zumaia, was...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
He said it was probably to blame, but no one else really said anything.
So, I just thought it was funny.
That was pretty funny.
Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
Yeah, I have one.
This is going to piss people off.
So, with Pokemon Battle Revolution coming out on the Wii in Japan, being one of the first online Wii titles, it comes with a little surprise for you.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Yes, it says the problem is you cannot send the friend codes over the Wii Online system either.
You have to actually exchange your 12-digit friend code in real life.
Nintendo, what the hell is wrong with you?
You've been told enough times this friend code system is not effective.
I understand what you guys are trying to prevent here with this whole, you know, people afraid about their kids, you know, whatever.
But seriously, it's simple enough that, like, both people have to have each other listed before they can even communicate with each other.
That's effective enough.
End of story.
There's no need for this, you know, 5,000 friend code stuff.
That's horrible.
I don't think Nintendo really gets the online market, do they?
I mean, because, I mean...
After all, they launched a new next-gen system.
Where's that report coming from?
Four Color Rebellion, which they're pretty... That's a respectable source.
Oh, man, that's horrible.
Yeah, so... And the other thing, too, this is actually Four Color Rebellion's reporting IGN articles, so... That's even better.
But...
They don't get it, do they?
They just don't get the online.
I mean, that's what I'm thinking.
Their online service so far, well, it doesn't exist.
Somebody's going to call Nintendo the carpet over this one.
I mean, because this is ridiculous.
This whole friend code crap.
So what the fuck was the point of swapping those friend codes?
Oh, so I can just send back some messages and send memes to each other, which, you know, only support one game so far?
It's...
Very disappointing.
Xbox really gets it in the online world.
They do.
They do.
And you know what?
They, of course, aren't charging for their online service when Nintendo isn't.
But, of course, there is no service to charge for.
So I'm just very disappointed.
Me too.
That's a bad thing to end on.
I would have done more FUs if I knew this was coming.
All right.
That's a heck of a thing to have as a last-minute story.
That must have been just late-breaking, huh?
Was this just posted a little while ago or before we... I think it's today.
Interesting.
All right.
Well, damn, that's the end of the show.
So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
Chris, thank you so much for being here tonight and everything that you've done.
Really appreciate it a lot.
And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
Oh, me first?
Okay.
Happy holidays.
I hope everyone has fun.
I'm going to Wisconsin for Megzi's birthday, so we're going to try and leave you guys a message or something for later on.
Cute, that'll be fun.
Just, you know, have fun, but not too much fun.
It's going to be basically, ah, ah, you know.
Remember, if you can't be good, be good at it.
Drew Nami, thanks for stopping by.
Sorry you didn't get to participate in Part A, but that's what happens when you're tardy.
Any final thoughts?
Hey, I didn't know I was invited.
You can come whenever, it's fine.
Okay, I'm flattered.
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good game.
Alright, Loki, your final thought?
My final thought is I gotta return Far Cry, I'm thinking it's gonna suck.
My final thought is Banana Muffin.
Dark Sakura, your final thought?
Okay, I was told one more.
Reject false icons, bitches.
I take that back.
This is the best Far Cry Vengeance trailer.
Jane has a rabbit in it.
And, and, and, and, and, and.
And?
And, and, Chris is awesome.
All right.
You're welcome.
Just so you guys, I agree, I agree.
Just so you guys know, our next live show is not all the way until January of, what's January 7th of 2007.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Have a great night, everybody.
We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you for supporting Independent Radio.
Bye.
