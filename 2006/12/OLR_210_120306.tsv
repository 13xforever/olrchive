20000	22000	Halo 3 releases beta information
22000	27000	And did Capcom finally list the complaints on small text?

795000	797000	You download them, you go, why was I so into this?
797000	799000	Some of the later Bonk titles were good.
799000	801000	Yeah, maybe that's what it is, but the first one was not that great.
801000	806000	There's just no point, though, because honestly, everything that's on Virtual Console right now, I have.
806000	809000	But isn't it nice to just have it all right there?
809000	812000	I didn't have it to a graphics, I didn't have a Genesis, so...
812000	816000	Well, half of the fun for me, and this whole reason why I'm not as much into emulators either,
816000	818000	is because I just like hooking up the system and playing it.
818000	823000	You know, I like the whole having the right controller in my hand, and...
823000	828000	So, if something comes up on the Virtual Console that was really rare that I don't have...
828000	831000	Like, say that they put, oh, a panorama cotton on...
831000	833000	Yeah, good luck. Good luck.
833000	836000	That's what I'm saying. You know, then maybe I will download something.
836000	839000	I see. Well, maybe you could start a petition.
839000	841000	I want them to put Guardian Legend on Virtual Console.
841000	843000	Okay, I would download Guardian Legend.
843000	847000	You know what I don't understand is why it's taking them so long to put these super Virtual Console games on there.
847000	852000	I think it's one of those things where they're trying to spread it out to make it look like, hey, new stuff every week.
852000	854000	Kind of like how Microsoft does.
854000	859000	You know, they're sitting on a few arcade games, and they only release the one a week, or whatever.
859000	865000	I imagine they go through the same QA process as most of their other games go through, and all that other stuff.
865000	867000	So, they probably have certification, all that crap.
867000	870000	So, they probably are just testing to make sure the games actually work.
870000	874000	You know, because backwards compatibility issues that you've heard on other systems,
874000	876000	maybe they're just making sure there's no bugs.
876000	879000	Maybe if you wait long enough between games, you'll buy the crappy ones.
879000	883000	I don't know. Well, my thought, okay, probably when the Metroid game comes out on Wii,
883000	886000	is when old-school Metroid will be available, and so on.
886000	888000	You know, they're probably going to do little things like that.
888000	889000	But it is very strange.
889000	890000	Where's Excitebike, then?
890000	891000	It is very, yeah, it's true.
891000	896000	It is very strange that Japan's launch is, like, Uber, if you look at their Virtual Console lineup.
896000	899000	I mean, they got Castlevania IV, and, like, a bunch of stuff I would really want.
899000	903000	Like, if they had Castlevania IV on Virtual Console, I'd be buying that shit right now.
903000	904000	Totally.
904000	905000	So...
905000	906000	Which I don't understand.
906000	911000	I mean, like, I have GameTap on the PC, and you can play the first three Castlevanias there, and other stuff.
911000	916000	You know, but I don't know what it is about the TV, and the sound system, and the Wi-
916000	919000	I'd love to curl up on the couch and play.
919000	921000	To be honest, I want the original games.
921000	925000	You know, like, games that they're making specifically for the Virtual Console.
925000	926000	Yeah.
926000	931000	That's what I would like to see, instead of this retro stuff, because I really just don't care too much.
931000	934000	And I bought Zelda, I bought Super Mario 64.
934000	935000	Have I played them?
935000	936000	Yeah, like, twice.
936000	937000	And that's it.
937000	938000	I'm done with them already.
938000	940000	I'd do that for some titles.
940000	943000	Like, SimCity, I played once or twice, and that was it.
943000	944000	I bought, like, five Virtual Console games.
944000	947000	I bought SimCity Mario Brothers, which was-
947000	949000	I even- I'm teasing myself.
949000	950000	Rob, you're so stupid for buying Mario Brothers.
950000	954000	It's been on, like, every single Game Boy Advance version of Mario,
954000	959000	but it really is, like, one of my favorite 80s arcade games they ever put out, was the old-school Mario Brothers.
959000	963000	I have a lot of memories of that as a kid, so maybe there's something to be said there.
963000	968000	But I bought those two, I bought Bonk, Zelda, and Sonic.
968000	970000	And I still want to get, like, Golden Axe.
970000	975000	And I'm going, Rob, why not just get that stupid Genesis collection on PS2 instead of buying these Virtual Console games?
975000	977000	I don't know, I can't stop.
977000	978000	It's an addiction.
978000	979000	Addict.
979000	982000	Maybe I keep hoping they're going to add multiplayer later on, I don't know.
982000	985000	Well, they said that they're going to be updating the Virtual Console games.
985000	986000	That's implied.
986000	988000	I don't think anyone in Nintendo said that.
988000	994000	That's implied from what they're seeing as the options on the Virtual Console.
994000	999000	When you go in there, you know, you can select the game and there's an option to update the game if there's one available.
999000	1003000	So people are implying that, but nothing's been said, as far as I know.
1003000	1004000	Well, anyway.
1004000	1008000	Outside of Virtual Console games, Trauma Center, second opinion on Wii.
1008000	1011000	Now, see, understand I never played the DS1, so this is all new to me.
1011000	1016000	Graphically, the game is not so hot, but the game itself is so great.
1016000	1022000	The operation and everything, the Wii is awesome for a game like that, so I'm having fun with that.
1022000	1025000	And then I've been watching my roommate play Excite Truck.
1025000	1026000	You guys know Eczema, right?
1026000	1028000	He is obsessed with Excite Truck.
1028000	1030000	In fact, he's playing it now.
1030000	1037000	He's gotten all the Excite and Super Excite and everything, and he's working on Mirror Mode right now, which I guess is in the game, too.
1037000	1039000	He's working on getting Mirror Mode.
1039000	1041000	He's getting S's in Super Excite.
1041000	1042000	Oh my gosh, this is crazy.
1042000	1044000	Like, every time I come home, there's Excite Truck going...
1044000	1045000	I found a fun peripheral for that.
1045000	1046000	What?
1046000	1049000	They have an actual wheel attachment for the Wiimote.
1049000	1050000	Oh, the GT game.
1050000	1052000	Won't work with Excite Truck.
1052000	1053000	Really?
1053000	1060000	Yeah, because you see Excite Truck, you have to keep the controller flat, and then you turn it, you know, so that you tilt it on that axis.
1060000	1067000	However, the wheel has it, you know, facing the top of the, you know, basically away the wrong direction.
1067000	1070000	I think you can, I think that'll work in Excite Truck, though.
1070000	1073000	I think, because I seem to remember E3, that's how I was playing it.
1073000	1077000	I have to go back and find that video or picture of me playing E3, but at E3, that's how I was playing it.
1077000	1080000	Because I thought that's how you were supposed to hold it, was out.
1080000	1085000	Like, where the, not where the controller's lying flat, but where the controller's facing you, and I think it still worked.
1085000	1088000	It does a little bit, but not how it's supposed to be.
1088000	1090000	No wonder I sucked hard at E3.
1090000	1093000	You could do it like the teacup ride, you know, have it flat down.
1093000	1101000	But the thing is, that peripheral would suck when it comes to playing the actual game, because you can't really reach the buttons very easily.
1101000	1102000	Yeah, I guess that's true.
1102000	1104000	Well, and to be honest, why would you buy it?
1104000	1110000	I mean, there was a gimmick to sell those two really, really old games, which have been reviewed very poorly,
1110000	1116000	and they're just ports of old games, and they're throwing this tacked-on controller because it's neat.
1116000	1119000	Ooh, you get a steering wheel attachment! Ooh!
1119000	1125000	And you can actually buy it by itself for $15, which I don't know why you'd want to spend the money for it, but whatever.
1125000	1127000	Because I just can't imagine this as a steering wheel.
1127000	1131000	I just need something to, you know, do the imagining for me.
1131000	1137000	As far as other games I've been playing, back over to the 360, I have been playing a little bit of Phantasy Star Universe.
1137000	1139000	I had to check out the new stuff when they added it.
1139000	1142000	And Burger King games, I actually checked out as well.
1142000	1149000	You know, they're all stupid, but considering the fact that they cost, you know, kind of less than an arcade game,
1149000	1150000	I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't.
1150000	1154000	I mean, you have to buy the value meal, so the games aren't really four bucks.
1154000	1157000	The games are like eight bucks with food, you know, type thing.
1157000	1161000	So, but whatever. It's still a pretty decent value, all things considered.
1161000	1167000	And, you know, the games, you know, I think Sneak King was my favorite, as I imagine most people.
1167000	1168000	All very creepy, though.
1168000	1172000	And Pocket Bite Racer, not so much. Wasn't feeling that one.
1172000	1173000	Big Bumpin' is somewhere in the middle.
1173000	1176000	Big Bumpin' is pretty easy to pick up and go, but...
1176000	1178000	I hear it's great on live.
1178000	1182000	I bet, yeah. I might have to check that out on live while I'm stealing your copies of those,
1182000	1185000	and try to get some of those achievements and what have you, but...
1185000	1187000	Super easy achievements for some of them.
1187000	1188000	Really? I don't know.
1188000	1191000	Well, you got one from getting stuck on a wall.
1191000	1195000	I played like two courses on that Pocket Bite Racer before I kind of got fed up with it,
1195000	1199000	and I already had gotten like 30 points in achievements for doing nothing.
1199000	1201000	So it was interesting.
1201000	1205000	I'm not the achievement point whore you are, though, Logie.
1205000	1207000	Maybe a little bit.
1207000	1209000	Let's see, what else?
1209000	1212000	Lastly, I would say I've been playing Viva Pinata.
1212000	1214000	I picked up last night.
1214000	1215000	It's interesting.
1215000	1217000	It's not what I thought it would be.
1217000	1220000	I mean, they told me, you know, it's kind of like The Sims and stuff,
1220000	1222000	but I don't know. I had something else pictured in my mind,
1222000	1226000	but there's a lot that goes on in that game at once.
1226000	1228000	I don't know if it's just because I've been moving pretty fast,
1228000	1231000	but if I was a kid, I'd be so lost in that game right now,
1231000	1233000	I wouldn't be able to keep up with it.
1233000	1236000	But it seems like things are happening so fast,
1236000	1238000	and I kind of keep wondering if I'm playing the game right,
1238000	1240000	but, you know, I'll just kind of keep at it.
1240000	1242000	So I'm having fun, and it's kind of cute,
1242000	1244000	and I like being able to name the creatures
1244000	1246000	because I've been giving them all X-rated names
1246000	1249000	and then watching them do the mating dance or whatever they do.
1249000	1251000	And there's some cute creatures in there,
1251000	1254000	and it's definitely better than the cartoon.
1254000	1256000	The best part was the beginning of the game
1256000	1258000	when you first got the shovel,
1258000	1260000	and I suggested that we hit the woman that kept talking.
1260000	1261000	Oh, yeah, the little guy.
1261000	1263000	Yeah, if you keep whacking her with the shovel,
1263000	1265000	she's like, if you do that one more time, you're going to be sorry.
1265000	1267000	And so I whacked her again with the shovel,
1267000	1269000	because there's actually like a little animation,
1269000	1271000	like she goes, ah, ah, ah.
1271000	1273000	Like, don't hit me with the shovel.
1273000	1275000	And then you hit her enough times just to say,
1275000	1276000	if you do that again, you're going to be sorry.
1276000	1278000	And then she takes away your shovel.
1278000	1281000	And she casts a little spell, and she takes away your shovel.
1281000	1282000	And you're kind of screwed.
1282000	1283000	Like, you have to have a shovel in that game
1283000	1286000	to clear places for the house to go.
1286000	1288000	So I had to like reset completely.
1288000	1291000	And Matt was just laughing the whole time.
1291000	1294000	Because it's fun to hit things with shovels.
1294000	1295000	There's actually, I hope you don't mind,
1295000	1296000	there's one other thing I forgot.
1296000	1297000	What's that?
1297000	1298000	The dance playing.
1298000	1299000	Okay, I'm done pretty much.
1299000	1300000	That was it.
1300000	1301000	Bookworm Adventure.
1301000	1302000	Bookworm Adventure?
1302000	1303000	Yeah.
1303000	1305000	I read stories on the internet about Bookworm Adventure.
1305000	1306000	Isn't that one of those like casual games,
1306000	1307000	like PopCap type games?
1307000	1308000	It's for kids.
1308000	1309000	Yeah?
1309000	1310000	But it's funny, because Dan's like,
1310000	1312000	this is actually getting challenging.
1312000	1315000	Well, maybe kids and my coworkers.
1315000	1317000	Because of tons of people at work,
1317000	1319000	I walk around and I see them playing, you know,
1319000	1325000	whether it be Bejeweled or Zuma or, what's that other one?
1325000	1327000	I've been playing Bejeweled on my cell phone.
1327000	1328000	Collapse.
1328000	1330000	Well, it's funny, while I was putting on my shoes
1330000	1331000	to come over this morning,
1331000	1333000	I was looking at watching Dan play the game,
1333000	1336000	and it sort of makes me think of sort of like Scrabble almost,
1336000	1338000	how you form your words out of the letters you're given.
1338000	1341000	But Dan's like, I have the XY sword,
1341000	1344000	so if I use a word with an X or a Y, I do triple damage.
1344000	1346000	I'm like, okay.
1346000	1347000	Oh, he needs to get xylophone,
1347000	1348000	because then he'd have both.
1348000	1349000	I don't think there'd be enough letters
1349000	1350000	pulled up for xylophone.
1350000	1351000	Whatever.
1351000	1352000	But the longer the word you spell
1352000	1353000	out of the letters you're given,
1353000	1354000	the more damage you do,
1354000	1355000	and he'd like beat up a lion,
1355000	1357000	and it had blood and everything.
1357000	1358000	Interesting.
1358000	1359000	Where can you check that out?
1359000	1360000	Do you know?
1360000	1361000	I actually do not,
1361000	1363000	but I will find out for our listeners next week.
1363000	1364000	Sounds good.
1364000	1366000	All right, a little bit of housekeeping.
1366000	1368000	This week will only be a one-part show.
1368000	1370000	I know you guys are probably really ticked off,
1370000	1372000	because we weren't even here last week,
1372000	1376000	but I'm out of town tomorrow night on our usual live time,
1376000	1379000	and because of that, Dark Sakura made other plans,
1379000	1380000	and I'm sure Loki's going to,
1380000	1382000	well, I don't know what he's going to do.
1382000	1383000	He'll do something as well.
1383000	1387000	So, sorry, but we'll be back live next week for sure,
1387000	1388000	and we'll do some fun stuff.
1388000	1391000	Maybe we'll do like a giveaway or something
1391000	1394000	to make up for us being kind of spotty the past couple weeks.
1394000	1396000	Oh, sorry, you won't be here next week, will you?
1396000	1400000	Yeah, I'm going to be at Disneyland.
1400000	1401000	Well, shoot.
1401000	1402000	Well, Loki and I will be live,
1402000	1404000	and we'll have some type of special guest.
1404000	1405000	I will call.
1405000	1406000	Okay.
1406000	1407000	I will call.
1407000	1408000	And give us the report.
1408000	1409000	Yeah.
1409000	1410000	All right.
1410000	1411000	I'm going to check out the arcade at Disneyland.
1411000	1412000	We have some website changes coming up,
1412000	1414000	just some little minor things.
1414000	1419000	We've put some live show status thing on our main website,
1419000	1421000	so for those of you guys that keep tabs of our spinoff shows,
1421000	1423000	because we do many live shows during the week here
1423000	1424000	on Orange Launch Radio,
1424000	1427000	you can keep status of what shows are being live this week
1427000	1429000	and what's in reruns and all that.
1429000	1430000	You can see that right on the main page.
1430000	1432000	And our news feed's going to be going through
1432000	1434000	some big changes this week as well,
1434000	1435000	so stay tuned for that,
1435000	1437000	because we haven't been posting a lot on our site lately,
1437000	1441000	we realize, so we're trying to change our approach
1441000	1443000	to how we're doing website updates,
1443000	1445000	and we think it's going to be successful.
1445000	1446000	We're going to take a lot of the stuff
1446000	1449000	that we originally conceptualized for our stuff blog,
1449000	1451000	and we're going to somewhat dismantle,
1451000	1452000	I don't want to say dismantle the stuff blog,
1452000	1454000	but we're not going to really update the stuff blog anymore,
1454000	1456000	because it wasn't really being updated anyway,
1456000	1457000	but we're going to take a lot of those ideas
1457000	1459000	and instead put them on the main website.
1459000	1461000	So stay tuned to orangelaunchradio.com,
1461000	1463000	and we hope you like what you see.
1463000	1466000	Also a lot of new forums coming to our website soon.
1466000	1468000	You'll see what that's all about pretty soon.
1468000	1470000	Also, speaking of the live station,
1470000	1472000	we had a brand new show debut last week,
1472000	1475000	it's called STFU, and it's a gaming show,
1475000	1478000	and right now it's airing live only on Thursdays
1478000	1480000	at 7 o'clock Pacific with DMN and DJ Tyrant,
1480000	1482000	and I heard the first episode was very well received,
1482000	1484000	so check it out.
1484000	1486000	We are looking into an audio archive or podcast,
1486000	1489000	whatever you want to call it, for that program.
1489000	1492000	More to come on that on end of 2007.
1492000	1494000	As well as Travis Donovan live is alive and kicking.
1494000	1498000	If you're into sci-fi, Travis, Saturday nights at 7,
1498000	1500000	good times, good times.
1500000	1504000	Also, there's other things being worked on for next year,
1504000	1508000	so keep an ear, I guess, to your computer speaker
1508000	1510000	or whatever you listen to us do.
1510000	1512000	Absolutely, and if you have an idea for a show,
1512000	1515000	if you think you can do better, let's hear it.
1515000	1518000	Send us an email, and we're open to new suggestions
1518000	1519000	for new shows always.
1519000	1521000	That's how DMN and DJ Tyrant did it.
1521000	1522000	We're open to new experiences.
1522000	1523000	That's right.
1523000	1525000	We're open to experimentation.
1525000	1530000	All right, that being said, let's get on into the gaming news.
1530000	1531000	It's been forever.
1531000	1532000	I have some news.
1532000	1533000	All right, Dark Soccer.
1533000	1534000	This makes me laugh.
1534000	1535000	Start us off.
1535000	1536000	What's up?
1536000	1542000	Well, Ken Kutaragi has been moved to CEO of SCEI,
1542000	1543000	Sony Computer Entertainment.
1543000	1545000	You mean Crayon Eating Officer?
1545000	1549000	Yes, Crayon Eating Officer.
1549000	1551000	He is now the man in charge.
1551000	1556000	Kaz Hirai is heading over to Tokyo to do the world group,
1556000	1563000	and the co-CEO of Sony America, Jack Trenton,
1563000	1566000	is going to take Kaz Hirai's place
1566000	1567000	and is actually going to be the first American
1567000	1570000	to hold that position in the company.
1570000	1571000	So that's actually pretty cool.
1571000	1577000	But I've seen speculation since I first found the information,
1577000	1581000	and actually I want to thank our buddy Rob Way
1581000	1585000	for sending me some of the first information on it, too.
1585000	1588000	I think the whole reason they're doing that is,
1588000	1590000	well, you done screwed this up.
1590000	1593000	You go sit in the office and eat some crayons there.
1593000	1600000	I think that he's got a broader vision, I think,
1600000	1601000	or maybe that's what they're thinking.
1601000	1604000	Well, it's weird because I've seen this story approached in two ways.
1604000	1609000	I've seen it approached as, oh, this is a downgrade for him.
1609000	1611000	Even though he's moving to a CEO position,
1611000	1615000	he's being moved because the Sony PlayStation 3 launch has been botched.
1615000	1617000	The PSP is not doing as well as it should have.
1617000	1619000	But I've also seen it reported as, this is a promotion.
1619000	1621000	He's going to be a CEO.
1621000	1623000	That's a big title.
1623000	1625000	It depends.
1625000	1628000	How much of a Sony fanboy or a Kudaragi fanboy are you?
1628000	1630000	That's how you're going to interpret this, I suppose.
1630000	1634000	Now, I'm going to take this from being that you've been in the same.
1634000	1640000	We've all been working for various corporations over our off-radio career.
1640000	1645000	But looking at this from a very upper management point of view,
1645000	1649000	I think that they see he's this public figure.
1649000	1654000	He's done really good through here as far as they think.
1654000	1658000	He could still do a benefit, but his vision is not what we need for this.
1658000	1659000	He has ruined this.
1659000	1662000	We do not need him on a focused thing.
1662000	1664000	We need him on the big picture.
1664000	1665000	I kind of agree.
1665000	1668000	I think when something's broken, you fix it,
1668000	1673000	and I think there is that perception that PlayStation 3 and PSP could be doing better.
1673000	1674000	Well, it's hard to say.
1674000	1677000	PlayStation 3, obviously, it's selling out on shelves, yes,
1677000	1680000	but not nearly as many as there should have been.
1680000	1682000	Certainly, it's made its way into pop culture,
1682000	1685000	but I think Sony had hoped to push more out by the end of the year
1685000	1687000	than they're realistically going to.
1687000	1689000	All this eBay profiteering stuff, whatever.
1689000	1693000	But since he has done a lot of good for the company previously,
1693000	1695000	I think they're just doing this shuffle to just try something
1695000	1697000	and put some new ideas in there.
1697000	1700000	So I think it's just them trying a different approach.
1700000	1702000	I don't necessarily think it's good or bad.
1702000	1703000	It's just different.
1703000	1704000	They want to go somewhere different.
1704000	1707000	I've seen similar things happen with the company that I work for.
1707000	1713000	I've seen people who I just thought were a total botch on their management jobs
1713000	1718000	go into VP positions and just soar.
1718000	1723000	I think as far as anything business related,
1723000	1724000	everyone's going to have their talents,
1724000	1725000	everyone's going to have their strong points here and there,
1725000	1729000	and where I still think that Kudaragi is probably a big old stupid, stupid,
1729000	1733000	no common sense person, he's there for a reason.
1733000	1736000	He's made it as far as he has for a reason.
1736000	1738000	PlayStation 2 did kick ass.
1738000	1746000	And I think that they're trying to save an asset that has proved beneficial to them in the past.
1746000	1747000	All right.
1747000	1750000	Loki, any thoughts on the whole corporate reshuffle?
1750000	1751000	I don't know.
1751000	1756000	Hopefully if putting him in a position that he has more authority, I guess,
1756000	1760000	will cause him to shut up more.
1760000	1767000	It would be most beneficial in Sony's eyes.
1767000	1771000	He just needs to shut up.
1771000	1775000	If he's good at running the company, great, run the company.
1775000	1779000	But just stop having him spout off stupid stuff because he's just...
1779000	1783000	Well, I think a lot of Sony management in general has been accused of being cocky
1783000	1787000	and all that other crap through this whole thing.
1787000	1791000	So I don't see this as one guy's problem
1791000	1796000	because the guy in Europe wouldn't shut his mouth either and all this other stuff.
1796000	1798000	Well, here's what it is to me.
1798000	1800000	It seems like the higher up you get,
1800000	1805000	I mean, granted, in the beginning you brought the company to where it needs to be.
1805000	1808000	You pretty much know your job.
1808000	1809000	You know how to do it.
1809000	1814000	But once you get so high up, you're hands off on a lot of it.
1814000	1820000	And so you kind of lose face where how stuff actually happens.
1820000	1823000	And pretty soon you become out of touch with how that company is actually running.
1823000	1829000	And so you start spouting off crazy shit and it's actually not realistic.
1829000	1833000	Well, moving on to something that I thought was kind of interesting
1833000	1835000	that kind of happened because of this.
1835000	1838000	This has been spreading like wildfire through blogs.
1838000	1841000	And you'll see this headline on all these game blogs,
1841000	1845000	PlayStation 4 is dead, PlayStation 4 not happening,
1845000	1847000	PlayStation 3, Sony's last console.
1847000	1851000	And it pretty much boils down to this quote coming from Yuta Sakurai,
1851000	1855000	who is an analyst at Nomura Holdings, who is talking about all this change.
1855000	1860000	He says, the appointment of Sakurai could be a start of shift from hardware to software.
1860000	1863000	I cannot now imagine a PlayStation 4
1863000	1868000	because Sakurai has previously been focused on software at Sony
1868000	1872000	and so they're reading into this move is that Sony's going to move back into software.
1872000	1877000	And I can't help but think to myself, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, put the car in park.
1877000	1880000	This guy is some analyst for some company.
1880000	1885000	I don't know why these analyst quotes always seem to make game blogs.
1885000	1889000	I mean, they're speculating just like any other fan is.
1889000	1894000	Sure, they get paid to maybe analyze statistics and sales and all that stuff,
1894000	1896000	but you guys are gamers.
1896000	1901000	You know how to analyze this stuff just as easily as these guys get paid the big bucks.
1901000	1903000	You guys know that it comes down to the good games.
1903000	1905000	And I'm thinking people are running way too far with this quote.
1905000	1909000	It's way too early to tell if Sony is going to ditch a PlayStation 4.
1909000	1913000	Come on, PlayStation 3 is still a baby.
1913000	1914000	What did they say?
1914000	1918000	To go ahead and quote, it was actually their U.S. spokesperson, Dave Cracker,
1918000	1922000	is on GameSpot, but I got my information from Eurogamer.
1922000	1925000	To quote, following the launch of PlayStation 3 just a few weeks ago
1925000	1927000	and witnessing the huge consumer demand for the product,
1927000	1930000	I think it would be rather short-sighted for anyone to predict
1930000	1933000	there might not be a next generation of PlayStation product.
1933000	1936000	Wow, that's one of the first smart things that Sony said in a long time.
1936000	1939000	I wouldn't exactly say huge demand. Okay, great.
1939000	1941000	You sold out of all the units that you produced.
1941000	1942000	Hooray for you.
1942000	1944000	What do you call the eBay profiteering?
1944000	1949000	Because they know that it's not based on Sony's product being uber great.
1949000	1952000	It's because, oh, look, I made lots of money on the 360 last year.
1952000	1955000	Look, there's a similar situation where there's not going to be enough consoles
1955000	1958000	and people want them, so we're going to sell them for a lot of money.
1958000	1961000	People are spending a buttload of money on those PlayStation 3s, though.
1961000	1962000	That's the demand they're talking about.
1962000	1966000	Because little Billy whines and wants, I want my PlayStation 3,
1966000	1968000	and then little Billy's parents will buy it.
1968000	1970000	Well, little Billy should go do the dishes.
1970000	1974000	Well, Hooray also was bringing up the PS4 himself,
1974000	1977000	talking about future plans,
1977000	1981000	and there was also discussion about them going into an electronic distribution
1981000	1983000	for games in the future.
1983000	1988000	I'm sorry, but they should not even be talking PlayStation 4 right now.
1988000	1990000	Make the PlayStation 3 work first.
1990000	1994000	Focus on, you know, maybe they do need to put a guy on the software side there.
1994000	1997000	Put out some better software for PlayStation 3.
1997000	1999000	What's the number one complaint been about this launch?
1999000	2002000	Their launch titles blow, except for maybe Resistance.
2002000	2006000	However, and I'm trying to see it from their point of view, too,
2006000	2011000	if they don't start thinking about the next generation of system now,
2011000	2013000	everybody else is going to be ahead of them.
2013000	2015000	Thinking about it and talking about it are two different things.
2015000	2019000	Yeah, but granted, though, this console is supposed to have a 10-year life cycle,
2019000	2021000	whereas the other ones are only five years.
2021000	2023000	So why are they concerned about the console now?
2023000	2026000	Are they going back on their word again?
2026000	2028000	I mean, woo, that'd be a shocker.
2028000	2034000	But really, if you're going to believe that there's going to be no PlayStation 4
2034000	2036000	when Microsoft announces the next Xbox,
2036000	2038000	they're definitely going to announce the next PlayStation.
2038000	2039000	Bingo.
2039000	2041000	I think that it actually,
2041000	2044000	I think the focus should be on the current system now that it's out,
2044000	2046000	but I think that it's still good,
2046000	2050000	because as long as you've got the money to pay for the team of specialists,
2050000	2051000	then do it.
2051000	2053000	You have your little team of specialists that are working away on it,
2053000	2056000	but they're in a closed room that we don't talk about,
2056000	2059000	because for me, if they were to come out and say,
2059000	2062000	oh, we've already got this PlayStation 4 thing in the works,
2062000	2065000	to me that's them saying, oh, well, the PlayStation 3 is fucked.
2065000	2068000	And I'm just going to say, well, I guess I ain't going to get one
2068000	2069000	because they're already working on 4.
2069000	2070000	Remember the Gizmondo?
2070000	2074000	Oh, yeah, by the way, even though our Gizmondo hasn't launched yet,
2074000	2077000	we've got the widescreen version in the works,
2077000	2082000	so it has to be like announcing the DS Lite when the DS comes out.
2082000	2086000	Or my question is, how come Nintendo gets away with this shit?
2086000	2089000	Because they just announced the Wii DVD thing,
2089000	2091000	but again, it's not a big deal.
2091000	2093000	It's going to be more expensive than who gives a shit.
2093000	2095000	It's like saying, oh, look, it plays CDs now.
2095000	2098000	Oh, goody, let me go run out and get another CD player.
2098000	2100000	Oh, wait, no, I don't need one because I have 60,000 of them.
2100000	2103000	We also know Wiis are going to come out in different colors at some point
2103000	2104000	depending on what we saw at E3.
2104000	2106000	You get them in different colors now.
2106000	2109000	They have sites that will do custom paint jams and things like that.
2109000	2110000	That's different.
2110000	2112000	I'm talking about officially licensed Nintendo pink Wiis.
2112000	2113000	Oh, big deal.
2113000	2114000	You want a pink Wii?
2114000	2115000	Yes.
2115000	2116000	Are you going to play with it?
2116000	2118000	Is that so wrong?
2118000	2121000	Yes, that's actually very wrong.
2121000	2123000	I just think it's interesting.
2123000	2125000	Even better if you get a Bluey.
2125000	2127000	It's just interesting.
2127000	2129000	Nintendo gets away with things sometimes
2129000	2132000	that other people are critical of other companies about,
2132000	2133000	and it's fascinating to me.
2133000	2136000	And even I'm guilty of it, too.
2136000	2138000	But because they're Nintendo, we let them get away with it.
2138000	2140000	I don't know.
2140000	2141000	Well, it comes down to games.
2141000	2142000	It comes down to games.
2142000	2145000	But, you know, Sony's always going back on their word and stuff,
2145000	2147000	and even now they're still insisting that they're going to ship
2147000	2151000	one million PlayStation 3 consoles by the end of this year.
2151000	2152000	Well, you know what?
2152000	2153000	I don't think so.
2153000	2158000	I mean, even Electronic Arts' Larry Prose was basically telling
2158000	2163000	Reuters that they only shipped out about 200,000 units,
2163000	2166000	if that, on the initial launch for the United States,
2166000	2167000	even though they were saying,
2167000	2169000	oh, yeah, we're going to have half a million units
2169000	2171000	or 600,000 units.
2171000	2173000	Yeah, they didn't really meet those numbers,
2173000	2176000	and kind of speculating on that,
2176000	2178000	they're probably only going to hit about half a million
2178000	2181000	to 800,000 by the end of the year.
2181000	2182000	Makes sense to me.
2182000	2184000	I mean, they've already underestimated
2184000	2186000	or overestimated the amount of units
2186000	2187000	that are going to be out there,
2187000	2191000	and I just don't think they can produce them fast enough,
2191000	2194000	especially if they start running into problems like
2194000	2197000	Microsoft had with, you know, units overheating
2197000	2200000	or, you know, some sort of hardware glitch.
2200000	2204000	AKA, be very careful about the first batch of any new console.
2204000	2208000	Well, given the run of first batch PlayStation 2s,
2208000	2211000	the just massive amounts of problems that they had,
2211000	2214000	on top of that, I think one of the big problems with the PS2
2214000	2218000	is that it was not really meant to be used as a primary DVD player,
2218000	2220000	which a lot of people were getting it for,
2220000	2224000	and the systems would burn out, the first models.
2224000	2227000	I'm actually still surprised that my first model Japanese one still works.
2227000	2231000	Well, yeah, I mean, what's also good, though,
2231000	2234000	is Nintendo is still saying that they're ahead of schedule,
2234000	2236000	and they're going to be shipping out the units that they promised,
2236000	2238000	so that's good.
2238000	2240000	At least those launches, I know in Japan,
2240000	2242000	certainly weren't delayed,
2242000	2245000	and they had enough units out there, so, you know,
2245000	2248000	I think what it comes down to is UK is, you know,
2248000	2249000	patiently waiting and saying,
2249000	2251000	okay, are we actually going to get our launch in March?
2251000	2253000	I mean, when we do have a launch,
2253000	2255000	exactly how many units is a launch?
2255000	2257000	I mean, here's your one unit.
2257000	2259000	Please share.
2259000	2261000	I don't know, I, you know,
2261000	2263000	we have a lot of folks over in the UK who listen to us,
2263000	2265000	and of course we're thankful for that,
2265000	2266000	and appreciate that you guys listen to us.
2266000	2268000	I can't help but think, you know,
2268000	2269000	you guys really aren't missing that much.
2269000	2271000	You're really not.
2271000	2272000	I understand.
2272000	2275000	Maybe you want the cheap Blu-ray player or whatever it is,
2275000	2277000	but, you know, I don't have one either right now.
2277000	2280000	I don't even really want one.
2280000	2282000	Does a European listener maybe want to send me money?
2282000	2284000	I'll buy you one here and send you one.
2284000	2286000	No, you can't even get them here.
2286000	2287000	I wouldn't be able to do that.
2287000	2288000	You can't ship them either.
2288000	2290000	Yeah, because of the lockdown.
2290000	2291000	Oh, geez.
2291000	2292000	Enclosed.
2292000	2293000	Form and grill.
2293000	2294000	Geez, geez, geez.
2294000	2295000	Put it in a form and grill box.
2295000	2297000	What you need to do is you need to ship it to another country,
2297000	2299000	and in that country, someone there has to, you know,
2299000	2300000	pretty much walk across.
2300000	2301000	It's not worth it.
2301000	2302000	It's not.
2302000	2305000	Is resistance that good, Jamie?
2305000	2308000	Is resistance that good?
2308000	2309000	No, not really.
2309000	2310000	Then there you go.
2310000	2311000	It's not worth it.
2311000	2313000	Just buy Call of Duty 3 and the 360.
2313000	2315000	It's about the same.
2315000	2320000	Resistance is pretty, and I do like shooting things in the head,
2320000	2323000	but I can shoot things in the head in other games,
2323000	2325000	like Resident Evil 4.
2325000	2328000	Shoot them in the head.
2328000	2331000	All right.
2331000	2332000	This ain't a cut scene.
2332000	2334000	Press A.
2334000	2337000	If I press A, it'll type over our show thing.
2337000	2341000	Anyway, so remember how all the fun that we were talking about,
2341000	2345000	Gran Turismo HD, and how it was just a big, you know, blown up,
2345000	2348000	you know, HD version of Gran Turismo 4?
2348000	2350000	And how the people looked like cardboard cutouts.
2350000	2353000	How the game was going to cost $700 after you bought all the cars.
2353000	2357000	Well, it's actually going to be a free demo now at the PlayStation store.
2357000	2361000	It'll be out so far only for Japan.
2361000	2364000	Be out on the 24th of December.
2364000	2366000	Gran Turismo HD concept.
2366000	2370000	It will have ten cars, two layouts of a single track,
2370000	2375000	at least according to what Yamauchi said, the designer.
2375000	2379000	It has Time Attack, Drift Trial, Network Ranking,
2379000	2385000	and they're also, I think, putting more focus, though,
2385000	2389000	on GT5 when it's out, which is actually slated for 2008.
2389000	2391000	Not bad for free, though.
2391000	2395000	That's a nice price reduction from, you know, $900 or whatever
2395000	2398000	we were joking about to free.
2398000	2400000	Yay for Sony. Good job.
2400000	2404000	I think someone finally stepped in, you know, like an analyst or something,
2404000	2406000	one of the guys that they have working for the company,
2406000	2408000	and they go, you actually think this is going to work?
2408000	2410000	Because this is not going to work.
2410000	2412000	The Internet hates you right now.
2412000	2414000	Maybe you need to try something different.
2414000	2418000	Yeah, but here's the thing, though.
2418000	2422000	We're not certain, though, what Gran Turismo 5 is going to be,
2422000	2424000	and they could very well do something like this,
2424000	2426000	you know, kind of meeting in the middle ground
2426000	2429000	and having, you know, a decent amount of cars,
2429000	2432000	you know, say like, I don't know, 60 or something,
2432000	2435000	and you still have to buy 500 other cars online.
2435000	2439000	So we don't know about that yet, but, I mean,
2439000	2441000	when you're advertising the game as a tech demo on E3,
2441000	2444000	and then you're all, oh, by the way, it's not a tech demo, that's a full game,
2444000	2446000	and we want you to buy it for 50 bucks.
2446000	2449000	Oh, by the way, it doesn't come with any cars.
2449000	2452000	I'm sorry, that's just, that's their same logic as saying,
2452000	2454000	oh, you'd buy a Sony PlayStation 3 if there weren't any games.
2454000	2457000	I think PR just kind of botched the project.
2457000	2460000	I agree with the concept that, you know what, just make Gran Turismo 5.
2460000	2463000	Shut up and make 5.
2463000	2468000	All right, anyway, we don't know if that'll be coming to the U.S. yet, do we?
2468000	2471000	I don't know. I just said Japan only right now, but I would suspect so.
2471000	2472000	Yeah, make sense.
2472000	2477000	I would kind of hope so, because I think it actually would be a nice apology.
2477000	2479000	Something, now, you know it would be...
2479000	2482000	We're sorry, here's a game.
2482000	2485000	You want to talk about a Geometry Wars killer for the online?
2485000	2487000	I mean, that's not a bad deal.
2487000	2489000	There's a lot of racing game fans who'd get a kick out of that, so maybe.
2489000	2493000	Anyway, let's talk about what you can get over the counter in Japan pretty soon
2493000	2497000	with some Japanese release dates coming out on the Xbox 360 on December 7th.
2497000	2500000	Blue Dragon, which is a big, big, big title for Japan,
2500000	2505000	and so it'll be interesting to see how the game does
2505000	2507000	and how many systems are sold in the next week.
2507000	2511000	It'll be kind of interesting to see what effect that has on Japan.
2511000	2514000	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, not a lot.
2514000	2518000	You don't really get any more games until you get Armored Core 4 on the 14th.
2518000	2519000	Same thing with the Wii.
2519000	2521000	Since you guys just had your system launch this week,
2521000	2526000	you're not going to get a whole lot of new titles until, again, December 14th
2526000	2528000	when you get Pokemon Battle Revolution
2528000	2531000	and the Japanese version of Rayman Raving Rabbids.
2531000	2534000	But if you're a PS2 fan still, you got a lot of games coming out.
2534000	2536000	You got Devil Summoner is coming out,
2536000	2539000	Ace Combat Zero both on the 7th,
2539000	2541000	Suikoden 5, Gensou Suikoden 5,
2541000	2547000	as well as Momotaru Densetsu 16 from Hudson,
2547000	2550000	and Taiko no Tatujin for our music game fans.
2550000	2551000	That's coming out.
2551000	2555000	Taiko no Tatujin Bang Tap, Tomori 7 Daimei,
2555000	2558000	both a drum controller version and the standalone version coming out.
2558000	2561000	And if you're a Tomb Raider fan in Japan,
2561000	2565000	Tomb Raider Legend on the PlayStation 2 on December 7th as well.
2565000	2568000	If you are a Nintendo DS person,
2568000	2572000	there's quite a few games also coming out over there on December 7th.
2572000	2579000	Several games from Media Works called DS Dendeki Bunko,
2579000	2582000	which I'm guessing might be a translation of the dice game.
2582000	2583000	I have no idea.
2583000	2588000	Also, DS Puzzler coming from TDK Media Active,
2588000	2591000	and Cinema Roll.
2591000	2593000	Hey, that's Sanrio.
2593000	2595000	Yeah, coming from Bandai.
2595000	2596000	Is it the same one?
2596000	2597000	Oh, it sure is.
2597000	2598000	Yeah.
2598000	2599000	So check out that one.
2599000	2601000	I don't have any silly title games this week,
2601000	2602000	but I like Cinema Roll,
2602000	2605000	so maybe that'll be my must-checkout title of the week.
2605000	2607000	Hey, if you're a PSP fan,
2607000	2611000	Mahjong and Parappa the Rappa this week, December 7th.
2611000	2612000	Hell yeah.
2612000	2613000	That's right.
2613000	2614000	Check that out.
2614000	2615000	You gotta believe.
2615000	2617000	We have two Cinema Roll...
2617000	2618000	Was it Pillows?
2618000	2619000	Remember the...
2619000	2620000	Oh yeah.
2620000	2621000	Went to the Sanrio outlet.
2621000	2622000	Yeah?
2622000	2623000	I need more Batsumaru stuff.
2623000	2626000	I want the Batsumaru guitar so bad.
2626000	2627000	So bad.
2627000	2628000	All right.
2628000	2629000	Anyway...
2629000	2630000	Actually...
2630000	2631000	Whatever.
2631000	2632000	We don't want to turn into Sanrio.
2632000	2635000	I think the Batsumaru one is a bass, though.
2635000	2636000	Anyways...
2636000	2637000	So...
2637000	2638000	Sorry, guys.
2638000	2641000	I was busy playing Hello Kitty World.
2641000	2642000	Anyways...
2642000	2646000	So, to start off, of course, our release dates.
2646000	2649000	We've got some stuff that you might not have heard about yet,
2649000	2652000	including some dates for some brand new Wii titles.
2652000	2655000	Mario Party 8 for the Wii, coming out March 6th.
2655000	2658000	Has that even been announced that Mario Party's in the...
2658000	2659000	I mean...
2659000	2660000	Duh, but...
2660000	2661000	Yeah, there's been video...
2661000	2662000	Okay, that's good.
2662000	2663000	Either...
2663000	2664000	I can't remember.
2664000	2665000	Space World or Tokyo Game Show.
2665000	2666000	I don't remember.
2666000	2668000	I've never seen it, though.
2668000	2670000	Wario Master of Disguise for the DS,
2670000	2673000	also coming out on the 6th of March.
2673000	2677000	Wii Plays coming through the United States on the 21st of January,
2677000	2679000	including the bundle with the remote.
2679000	2682000	Actually, it is only bundled with the remote.
2682000	2685000	There's going to be some stuff coming out...
2685000	2688000	Actually, a new Spyro game is in the works right now.
2688000	2689000	Still working titles.
2689000	2690000	Spyro 2007.
2690000	2692000	Obviously, it's not going to be Spyro 2007.
2692000	2694000	Spyro Ultimate!
2694000	2698000	It's coming out on August 15th of next year.
2698000	2702000	It's going to be on PlayStation 2, the Wii, DS, Game Boy Advance, and PSP.
2702000	2704000	This one, I hope, is the working title.
2704000	2707000	Crash Jackin' 07.
2707000	2710000	That's for PlayStation 2, the 360.
2710000	2715000	Wii, DS, Game Boy Advance, and PSP also come out on August 15th.
2715000	2720000	Mommy, for my birthday, I want Crash Jackin' on the Wii.
2720000	2727000	What's funny is Blazing Angels for the Wii has been delayed to March 14th of next year.
2727000	2734000	To coincide with the Blazing Angels 2 release on the 360, which is also the same day.
2734000	2736000	It's very strange.
2736000	2740000	Of course, this next week, we've got some good stuff coming out.
2740000	2743000	For the Wii, we have Ice Age 2.
2743000	2746000	I said good stuff, so that's not exactly counted in there.
2746000	2754000	But we do have Far Cry Instinct's Vengeance, I believe, is coming out on the Wii as well.
2754000	2757000	That one actually, I heard, is pretty good. It has a good control system in that.
2757000	2761000	So, if you were jaded by Red Steel, you might want to pick that one up instead.
2761000	2768000	And then, of course, on the 360, we've got Star Trek Legacy, which is going to be pretty good.
2768000	2771000	And Rapala Trophies, which is not going to be very good at all.
2771000	2777000	And on PlayStation 2, one of the only games coming out on PlayStation 2 for December,
2777000	2779000	Rayman's Raving Rabbids, finally.
2779000	2782000	So, if you don't have a Wii, that's definitely one to pick up.
2782000	2785000	On PSP, though, you've got some good stuff.
2785000	2788000	Of course, you've got Brothers in Arms D-Day.
2788000	2795000	And also, on the PlayStation 3, Full Auto 2, which is basically Full Auto 1 with Deathmatch.
2795000	2801000	And Fight Night Round 3, which is basically Fight Night Round 3 with first-person mode.
2801000	2803000	I'm kind of curious about the Star Trek game.
2803000	2805000	I liked what I saw at E3.
2805000	2809000	I'm not usually a tactical games-type person, but I am a little bit of a Trekkie.
2809000	2812000	I liked the whole Borg ship.
2812000	2814000	Well, I liked how they re-enacted the Erathicon thing.
2814000	2815000	That was kind of rad.
2815000	2816000	That was fabulous.
2816000	2818000	I'm tempted to check it out.
2818000	2824000	The PSP also is getting Star Wars Lethal Alliance, which is that kind of original game for PSP.
2824000	2830000	So, it's kind of a smorgasbord of stuff to lead for November.
2830000	2838000	Well, in UK gaming news, actually a bunch of games already came out, but we weren't live to cover it.
2838000	2840000	So, I'll just go quickly over that list.
2840000	2844000	Sonic Rivals came out, a couple football manager games.
2844000	2848000	Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, Viva Pinata, Yoshi's Island.
2848000	2851000	Today being the second, actually.
2851000	2854000	Tokobot Plus, Mysteries of the Katakuri came out.
2854000	2857000	Coming out on the 8th, though, we have Wii Launch.
2857000	2859000	So, get your Wii.
2859000	2863000	Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, and then give me your friend code.
2863000	2867000	So, coming out, we have Barnyard.
2867000	2871000	We have Brothers in Arms D-Day, Call of Duty 3, Cars, Dead or Alive Xtreme 2.
2871000	2872000	Get that as well.
2872000	2880000	EA Replay goes to Recon Advanced Warfighter with more acronyms.
2880000	2885000	Hey, if you guys in the UK are camping out for a Wii, send us some audio.
2885000	2887000	Talk to some people in line and send us some audio.
2887000	2890000	We want to hear from some of the other countries' launches,
2890000	2892000	because we played some audio in our last live episode.
2892000	2895000	Chris out there at Target interviewing some folks.
2895000	2897000	I want to hear from some UK people.
2897000	2900000	So, I know we've got some listeners out there.
2900000	2902000	Send me a cassette tape if you have to,
2902000	2904000	but make an MP3 somehow and send it to us.
2904000	2908000	I want to hear from some British folks that are excited about the launch.
2908000	2910000	Seriously, just take it out,
2910000	2913000	and then even if you have to Skype it to us through your computer,
2913000	2914000	you can do that, too.
2914000	2918000	Yeah, you can always call the voicemail, 877-GAME-OLR.
2918000	2920000	Oh, that's not toll-free in Europe, though, sorry.
2920000	2922000	That's why I'm saying take it home and play it through your Skype.
2922000	2923000	There you go, there you go.
2923000	2925000	You can do audio feed through your Skype.
2925000	2926000	That's true, that's true.
2926000	2931000	Also, though, we have King of Fighters XI.
2931000	2934000	If that's the 3D one, I don't know.
2934000	2937000	GT Pro Series, Madden 2007, like anyone cares.
2937000	2941000	Monster 4x4 World Circuit, Need for Speed Carbon, Open Season,
2941000	2945000	Rampage Total Destruction, Rayman Raving Rabbids for a bunch of stuff,
2945000	2949000	Red Steel, Star Trek Legacy,
2949000	2951000	sorry, tongue tied.
2951000	2953000	Star Wars Lethal Alliance, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz,
2953000	2955000	Superman Returns a Video Game,
2955000	2958000	Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, which is very fun,
2958000	2961000	Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam,
2961000	2964000	which I'm probably, I think, one of five people that likes that game.
2964000	2968000	Wii Play, Wii Sports, because, of course, it's the Wii.
2968000	2974000	And in other notables later on this month is Far Cry Vengeance Sims 2 Pets,
2974000	2978000	which is actually kind of fun because your pets are on crack.
2978000	2984000	Actually, Marvel Ultimate Alliance already came out, too, on, I think, PS2.
2984000	2986000	On PSP, I'm sorry.
2986000	2988000	And that's really it.
2988000	2990000	And also, just to go ahead and make a mention,
2990000	2994000	I am going to try to be focusing at least once a month
2994000	2997000	on some of the other countries that have different release dates.
2997000	3001000	So if there's any place in particular that you've found as a reliable source
3001000	3004000	for release dates internationally, let me know.
3004000	3006000	Send me an email, jamieatorangeholdradio.com.
3006000	3009000	Sounds good. And that was kind of inspired by our listener email, wasn't it?
3009000	3011000	It was, which I will be addressing later.
3011000	3012000	Oh, okay. Then I won't spoil that.
3012000	3014000	Let's go on back to some news then.
3014000	3017000	Let's talk about some things happening here stateside.
3017000	3019000	Very interesting news report coming out of Chicago.
3019000	3023000	The Better Business Bureau is challenging Toys R Us
3023000	3025000	based on what happened at the Wii launch.
3025000	3029000	They were forcing people to buy bundles, essentially what was happening.
3029000	3031000	Now, keep in mind, this is not nationwide.
3031000	3034000	This was a particular store in the area that got a lot of heat for this
3034000	3038000	because I know at other Toys R Uss across the country this wasn't a problem.
3038000	3040000	Very similar to what happened with Best Buy in the 360.
3040000	3043000	Remember how Best Buys in the Northwest were forcing the bundles?
3043000	3046000	Well, Toys R Us was forcing, I believe, the Wii,
3046000	3050000	three games and their warranty thing they had to buy.
3050000	3054000	And this one lady was mad and was arguing with the manager about it,
3054000	3057000	and the Wii sold out while they were arguing about it.
3057000	3058000	She was pissed.
3058000	3061000	She did one of those consumer call the news things,
3061000	3063000	and now the Better Business Bureau is investigating it.
3063000	3065000	And I say good.
3065000	3066000	I agree.
3066000	3072000	I think companies need to be aware that we're not going to tolerate that bullshit bundling stuff.
3072000	3074000	I don't want your stupid warranty.
3074000	3077000	If somebody does, great, they can purchase that.
3077000	3080000	You can offer it to me and I can say no, but don't force me to buy it.
3080000	3081000	That's messed up.
3081000	3085000	And the games and all that crap, I say good.
3085000	3087000	And this isn't necessarily something against Toys R Us
3087000	3089000	because in my mind, reading this story,
3089000	3095000	this sounds like one manager's or district manager's very piss poor decision
3095000	3098000	that's going to screw the company as a whole thanks to that.
3098000	3102000	So I will take great satisfaction in knowing that thanks to this,
3102000	3107000	that manager or district manager will probably be canned because of this.
3107000	3113000	And I hope it will be a lesson for other managers and district managers nationwide.
3113000	3117000	Don't try to use these big console launches,
3117000	3119000	not that there's going to be another one for quite some time,
3119000	3124000	but in the future, don't use these big console launches and the consumer demand for them to sell your crap.
3124000	3126000	Force us to buy your crap.
3126000	3129000	So, any other thoughts on that, Loki?
3129000	3133000	I understand why they did it, but the bait and switch part's not good.
3133000	3136000	The bundling's okay, bait and switch's not good.
3136000	3138000	Do you think it's okay to force people to buy those bundles?
3138000	3139000	Yeah.
3139000	3140000	I don't think so.
3140000	3141000	I think it's perfectly fine to do.
3141000	3142000	Why?
3142000	3147000	Because if you saw what the margins were on the systems and the accessories and the games,
3147000	3150000	you would understand why they have to because Nintendo's saying,
3150000	3153000	oh, by the way, all that profit that you want, I ain't going to get it.
3153000	3154000	You're going to get a dollar.
3154000	3159000	But don't you think that logically people are going to buy the games with the system
3159000	3163000	or they're going to buy stuff and if they have a good experience with it about the system,
3163000	3164000	they'll buy their games there?
3164000	3166000	It's about the return business, you know what I mean?
3166000	3169000	If they're going to buy a PlayStation 3 for $2,000 on eBay,
3169000	3175000	what the hell is going to stop me from selling a PlayStation 3 in a retail store with three games attached to it?
3175000	3177000	You're going to buy it.
3177000	3181000	Our target, I don't know if it's just our target or if all of them were doing it.
3181000	3182000	I think it was a national thing.
3182000	3183000	They handled it very well.
3183000	3187000	Instead of forcing somebody into something, because remember,
3187000	3191000	it's the same thing from when you're a little kid.
3191000	3194000	You want to do other than what you're being made to do, you know?
3194000	3198000	That's the biggest part of it is you tell me I have to and I'm like,
3198000	3199000	nuh-uh, I don't have to do shit.
3199000	3200000	I don't have to do shit.
3200000	3201000	I'm gonna.
3201000	3203000	Who the hell are you to tell me what I have to do?
3203000	3208000	Well, the way Target did it, which I was actually very, very, very pleased with this,
3208000	3210000	is they gave you an incentive.
3210000	3212000	And true, it wasn't like much of an incentive.
3212000	3214000	You get a flashy thing that gives you...
3214000	3215000	Hey, I still have mine.
3215000	3216000	It's pretty.
3216000	3217000	It is pretty.
3217000	3218000	Look at that.
3218000	3219000	Ooh, it glows blue.
3219000	3220000	I can go get one right now.
3220000	3224000	Yeah, Miklotov bought 15 of these with a dollar each on the card.
3224000	3226000	They're these little gift cards that glow blue.
3226000	3228000	I hope you international folks get something similar.
3228000	3231000	I don't know if they even have Target internationally, but they're so pretty.
3231000	3234000	I was gonna get one just to have one, you know?
3234000	3236000	You know what, if they don't do this internationally,
3236000	3238000	maybe I'll send this one to one of our international listeners,
3238000	3239000	because they're pretty.
3239000	3240000	They're very pretty.
3240000	3243000	Yeah, it's awfully cool that they glow blue there,
3243000	3246000	even though the console doesn't seem to.
3246000	3247000	Yes, it does.
3247000	3248000	When do you get new mail?
3248000	3250000	Only when I get new mail.
3250000	3251000	Oh, when it runs updates.
3251000	3253000	Do you want me to send you mail, Loki?
3253000	3255000	No, I can get mail myself.
3255000	3258000	But I'm just saying, I want to glow blue all the time.
3258000	3262000	It can pulse blue when I have mail.
3262000	3263000	You're picky.
3263000	3268000	Well, at any rate, I think that we should pick up a couple of them
3268000	3270000	and send some to our overseas listeners if they don't get them.
3270000	3272000	Yeah, I don't know if Target's overseas or what,
3272000	3275000	so send some emails if you really want it.
3275000	3276000	We'll see what we can do.
3276000	3277000	Yeah.
3277000	3278000	All right.
3278000	3281000	With the launches, of course, there's still lots of desire,
3281000	3283000	especially from the Wii.
3283000	3286000	Lots of things that we wish they would have done that they didn't do.
3286000	3288000	For example, and this is actually...
3288000	3289000	Whose list is this?
3289000	3290000	This isn't my list.
3290000	3291000	This is Game Informer's list.
3291000	3292000	Okay.
3292000	3294000	But I do agree with a lot of it, and a lot of it I do agree with.
3294000	3299000	Like, for example, accessories component and S-Video cables.
3299000	3300000	Where are they?
3300000	3303000	They certainly are sold out and can't seem to find anywhere,
3303000	3306000	so that kind of sucks.
3306000	3309000	More virtual console downloads, because, I mean, you know,
3309000	3313000	12 games is great, but it's not enough.
3313000	3318000	A wireless sensor bar might be nice, especially if you have a projection TV.
3318000	3323000	The ability to save GameCube saves to the flash memory cards or SD cards
3323000	3330000	might be good, especially if you're renting games or never had GameCube stuff.
3330000	3334000	Better straps for the wireless Wiimotes.
3334000	3338000	Now, I think that's just stupid people letting the controllers go,
3338000	3341000	whatever, but I guess they could be stronger.
3341000	3346000	More user-friendly friends list, and I could definitely agree with that.
3346000	3352000	A wireless classic controller, so it doesn't have to be tethered to the remote there.
3352000	3356000	And, of course, you know, redesign the Wavebird,
3356000	3359000	which I don't really understand that part of it, but okay.
3359000	3361000	I think they're saying they want, like, a GameCube controller.
3361000	3364000	Yeah, I think they want it more like the classic controller.
3364000	3368000	More robust Wiimotes sensor bar calibration, like Zelda,
3368000	3372000	and that was their example, because I guess you can actually set where the bar is,
3372000	3373000	which is kind of neat.
3373000	3376000	A music channel, which I'm surprised they didn't have it.
3376000	3379000	I mean, a picture channel I don't really get either, but a music channel would...
3379000	3381000	I've actually been able to use picture channel,
3381000	3384000	because my phone saves to the micro-SDs, and I have a converter,
3384000	3387000	so I put the SD card in there, and that's how I sent some pictures.
3387000	3389000	Didn't I send you and Nelly, like, a picture that I doctored?
3389000	3390000	Yeah.
3390000	3393000	A picture I took of a stripper, and I drew, like, a fart cloud coming out.
3393000	3395000	It was really immature, but it was funny when I sent it.
3395000	3399000	Yeah, but actually I heard that it'll grab stuff off of Bluetooth,
3399000	3401000	so if your phone's Bluetooth, it'll grab it off of there.
3401000	3402000	The Bluetooth on my phone's weird.
3402000	3403000	Okay.
3403000	3406000	Anyways, points leftovers, because the Wii points,
3406000	3408000	you have to buy them in $10 increments,
3408000	3411000	and so when you buy something, you're left over some excess points.
3411000	3414000	Then the 360 guilty of the same thing.
3414000	3415000	Yeah.
3415000	3417000	Whatever.
3417000	3419000	Anyways, online services...
3419000	3421000	I guess that's one thing Sony's doing right,
3421000	3424000	is that they're using real cash, none of the stupid Sony points stuff,
3424000	3426000	you know, good for them.
3426000	3428000	Online service experience, I guess,
3428000	3431000	you know, there's a lot of trouble connecting to the shops and stuff.
3431000	3435000	Optical audio out, and I guess I can understand that,
3435000	3437000	because Prologic 2 is okay.
3437000	3439000	Wireless nunchuck, I don't think so.
3439000	3442000	That's another thing that people are going to throw through a window.
3442000	3444000	Let's see.
3444000	3446000	Boy, this is a bitch list, isn't it?
3446000	3447000	It is a bitch list.
3447000	3450000	Better fleshed out accomplishments list,
3450000	3454000	because, you know, I guess play history is just not really an accomplishment.
3454000	3457000	More control over the blue slot illumination.
3457000	3459000	I definitely agree with that one.
3459000	3461000	Rechargeable battery packs.
3461000	3462000	I agree with the achievement thing.
3462000	3465000	I can't believe no one copied Microsoft on that whole thing.
3465000	3466000	I think it's cute.
3466000	3468000	I wish they would have done something like that.
3468000	3470000	And what was I going to say?
3470000	3473000	The battery packs, I think, are coming,
3473000	3475000	because if you look inside of it,
3475000	3477000	there's actually like a contact where they could have a wireless,
3477000	3479000	like a battery pack for it.
3479000	3482000	So that might be something that's on its way.
3482000	3484000	Better speakers in the Wiimote, because they suck,
3484000	3488000	and I'm actually thinking about taking one apart to replace a speaker in it.
3488000	3489000	You're weird.
3489000	3491000	We may see that on a future show.
3491000	3493000	Save games in the Wiimote, which might be cool.
3493000	3495000	More customization for the Wii menu.
3495000	3499000	Game Boy Player, timed demos for every virtual console game,
3499000	3501000	because a lot of these games I haven't played,
3501000	3502000	so I don't know if they're crap.
3502000	3507000	Okay, this is turning into just like every little thing that they can think of,
3507000	3511000	you know, they're putting on here that, you know, I don't know.
3511000	3513000	Probably not as if they haven't already thought of it themselves.
3513000	3515000	I know, this is getting to be a little much.
3515000	3518000	Wii Sports in a case, because they got it in a case in...
3518000	3519000	I could agree with that.
3519000	3520000	Australia.
3520000	3521000	But that is, you know...
3521000	3524000	No ethernet port, which is kind of lame.
3524000	3527000	And this doesn't even have anything to do with it.
3527000	3530000	Club Nintendo for the U.S.
3530000	3531000	Well, it's cool.
3531000	3533000	They get the, like, you know, the points and stuff,
3533000	3538000	like the DS, was it those games and stuff.
3538000	3541000	How hard would it really be for Nintendo to go back and add some of the stuff, though?
3541000	3542000	They have built the updates to be pretty easy.
3542000	3544000	They could add the music channel if they wanted.
3544000	3546000	Yeah, and who says it's not coming later on?
3546000	3548000	I mean, they said that there's a bunch of surprises,
3548000	3550000	and we'll see some in the next few weeks.
3550000	3552000	All right.
3552000	3553000	It's not hard.
3553000	3555000	Oh, we'll see.
3555000	3556000	You know what I want?
3556000	3557000	What?
3557000	3560000	I want freaking region free, but no.
3560000	3563000	Yeah, they've confirmed it is region locked, the Wii is.
3563000	3565000	So...
3565000	3568000	We cry, we cry, and then we import.
3568000	3570000	Until they make a swap.
3570000	3573000	Merely a small obstacle for now.
3573000	3575000	Now, I heard somebody claim that you can use a boot disk,
3575000	3578000	but then I heard another blogger refute that, so...
3578000	3580000	You can for GameCube games.
3580000	3581000	For some games.
3581000	3582000	They're saying that, yeah, it doesn't always work.
3582000	3585000	I actually, they were saying with an action replay that I have a freeloader,
3585000	3589000	so when I get home, I'll try it with my freeloader.
3589000	3590000	See if it works.
3590000	3591000	All right.
3591000	3593000	We'll see.
3593000	3595000	Speaking of things being locked away,
3595000	3597000	there was an update to the Wii console this week,
3597000	3599000	and a lot of people were very excited because they were like,
3599000	3602000	ooh, maybe I'll have a forecast channel or a news channel to play with,
3602000	3605000	or maybe they fixed some of the HD issues or whatever.
3605000	3609000	But no, really all the update did was that, you know,
3609000	3611000	it said it updated parental controls,
3611000	3613000	and then it locked out that whole thing
3613000	3615000	where people were going into the shop channel
3615000	3619000	and turning it into a browser, which was kind of pointless
3619000	3620000	because you couldn't do much with the browser,
3620000	3622000	but I think it was just one more of those things
3622000	3625000	where somebody wanted to be able to do it to say they did it.
3625000	3627000	Well, Nintendo put the smackdown on that.
3627000	3632000	You could do it, and they're still working on a way around that, so...
3632000	3633000	It's turning into the PSP now.
3633000	3636000	How can we hack away their little, you know,
3636000	3638000	and then they'll update, and then, you know,
3638000	3640000	somebody finds another hack to get what they want,
3640000	3641000	and then they'll update.
3641000	3643000	There's PSP all over again.
3643000	3646000	It's still going on, so, you know, sooner or later.
3646000	3648000	And also the other thing, too,
3648000	3651000	is people were able to download virtual console games off of a server,
3651000	3653000	so all they have to do is figure out how to encode them
3653000	3656000	and you'd be pirating games off of their servers.
3656000	3657000	Oh, interesting.
3657000	3658000	So, yeah.
3658000	3661000	That's probably another reason why they wanted to fix that.
3661000	3664000	Yeah, Nintendo may be already looking into making sure that doesn't happen.
3664000	3665000	We'll see.
3665000	3666000	Didn't they change, like,
3666000	3668000	because you could browse the virtual console stuff on the web,
3668000	3671000	but then they changed that where now it's all certificate-based
3671000	3672000	or something like that?
3672000	3673000	Yeah, it's all certificate-based,
3673000	3677000	and now it checks the IP instead of just the URL,
3677000	3679000	but I think people are going to find ways around that.
3679000	3680000	It's just a matter of time.
3680000	3682000	That's really what it is.
3682000	3685000	Now, speaking of updates to the virtual console,
3685000	3688000	there are going to be some more games coming out on Monday here,
3688000	3690000	and some good stuff.
3690000	3694000	Donkey Kong Jr. for the NES is going to be making its way out there,
3694000	3698000	and then on the Genesis we've got Columns, Rizstar,
3698000	3703000	and Victory Run for, I believe, the TurboGrafx-16.
3703000	3706000	So, not too bad.
3706000	3707000	I don't know.
3707000	3708000	I want some more games like...
3708000	3710000	Rizstar was Saturn, wasn't it?
3710000	3711000	No.
3711000	3712000	No, that was...
3712000	3713000	Think of another game.
3713000	3714000	Sorry.
3714000	3715000	It was Genesis.
3715000	3719000	Anyways, I want my Super Mario Brothers, God damn it.
3719000	3724000	I want Super Mario World, and I want Kid Icarus.
3724000	3726000	I want Kid Icarus so bad.
3726000	3728000	I want it so bad.
3728000	3730000	I hope that's the one game they're like,
3730000	3733000	oh, by the way, for some reason this just wouldn't work with the virtual console.
3733000	3738000	I will poke Reggie in the eye myself
3738000	3742000	if they can't get Kid Icarus working on the Wii virtual console.
3742000	3744000	I will drive up to Redman and poke him in the eye.
3744000	3748000	I want them to emulate Turbo Duo,
3748000	3750000	because I want Dracula X.
3750000	3753000	Dream On.
3753000	3757000	No offense, but, I mean, do you think that's high on their priority list right now?
3757000	3758000	I know it should be.
3758000	3760000	No, but it would be very easy.
3760000	3764000	It's a freaking Super Nintendo game with real audio, is what it is.
3764000	3765000	I mean, seriously.
3765000	3766000	But, yeah.
3766000	3769000	That would be my bit of heaven right there.
3769000	3770000	I would pay for that.
3770000	3775000	I mean, so that I don't have to gingerly handle my, you know, CD and go,
3775000	3777000	oh, please don't scratch, please don't scratch.
3777000	3778000	Where's one of the burns of it?
3778000	3779000	Okay, my burn doesn't work.
3779000	3780000	Damn.
3780000	3782000	Because that's what I go through every time I play that game.
3782000	3783000	All right.
3783000	3787000	Well, one other thing Jamie goes through every week is that she likes to open up the mailbag
3787000	3791000	and read some e-mails that you guys send in to us at mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com,
3791000	3796000	and she reads the mails and responds to them right here on our program.
3796000	3798000	And she's going to do that right now.
3798000	3809000	Well, the first one comes from someone named Guy.
3809000	3812000	Actually, apparently one of our listeners from the UK.
3812000	3814000	Hey, by the way, Guy.
3814000	3819000	I was kind of mad that you weren't in the Final Fight they put on Super Nintendo until way later.
3819000	3825000	I just want to point that out because Guy was my favorite.
3825000	3826000	Sorry, go ahead and read.
3826000	3827000	I actually have Final Fight Guy.
3827000	3828000	Read the damn e-mails.
3828000	3829000	Sorry.
3829000	3831000	Did I tell you about my Final Fight collection?
3831000	3833000	I was trying to collect every version of Final Fight.
3833000	3835000	Dude, they need to put Final Fight Guy on Virtual Console.
3835000	3837000	I have Final Fight Guy, though.
3837000	3838000	Anyway, sorry.
3838000	3839000	With the box.
3839000	3840000	We totally just lost a listener.
3840000	3841000	Sorry.
3841000	3842000	Hi.
3842000	3845000	I don't get why all the movies and games are out in America before.
3845000	3848000	In England, is it because America is a bigger financial target?
3848000	3849000	Thanks, Guy.
3849000	3851000	What's your speculation?
3851000	3856000	It's your TVs because they have to convert everything for the other format,
3856000	3859000	and I think that's what causes things to get delayed.
3859000	3864000	Everyone needs to have a HDTV, and then it won't matter.
3864000	3868000	So maybe in five years because HDTV is picking up more and more,
3868000	3871000	but for right now, yeah, it's your TVs.
3871000	3872000	Sorry.
3872000	3874000	I've got my Gorillaz DVDs.
3874000	3875000	They're PAL.
3875000	3878000	I had to run through my laptop into the TV.
3878000	3880000	Yeah, it's a pain for us.
3880000	3883000	When you guys have stuff we want, which happens once in a while
3883000	3886000	with music and videos and things of that nature
3886000	3888000	because you guys get a lot more music stuff over there.
3888000	3889000	Oh, it's Region 2, but it's PAL.
3889000	3890000	Exactly.
3890000	3892000	I remember one big thing that I had friends doing
3892000	3895000	was that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was out on DVD over there
3895000	3897000	way sooner than it was over here.
3897000	3898000	Highlander.
3898000	3905000	When the Highlander series came out, the UK versions had extra footage.
3905000	3908000	So take comfort that once in a while you get something the nerds really want.
3908000	3914000	You get them unedited, and freaking Torchwood has blood and sex and language,
3914000	3915000	and I love it.
3915000	3917000	So, sorry.
3917000	3919000	I had to go off on that because I was watching Torchwood
3919000	3921000	and going, wow, this wouldn't make it here.
3921000	3926000	Anyway, we have one from Miso.
3926000	3929000	It says, I'm Miso Sky.
3929000	3932000	Is the creation of video games similar to an art form?
3932000	3934000	I think it is, as it involves creativity.
3934000	3938000	It could be closely related to theater arts because it is a collaborative art.
3938000	3941000	You have your music people, your writers, your technical people.
3941000	3942000	So I think it could be an art form.
3942000	3944000	Happy Yule, Miso.
3944000	3945000	I agree.
3945000	3948000	It's kind of like, I think it's very similar to a movie.
3948000	3950000	It's like an interactive movie, especially these days.
3950000	3955000	I mean, movies, storyboarded, games storyboarded.
3955000	3957000	There are similarities between the way that they go,
3957000	3959000	the scripting and the concept and everything.
3959000	3962000	I think it's a visual art form.
3962000	3965000	I mean, sometimes when you say art form, people want to compare it to paintings.
3965000	3967000	They want to compare it to Picasso.
3967000	3970000	No, art's a lot of different things.
3970000	3973000	Well, it's like spoken word is art,
3973000	3976000	but you don't put it in the same category as you do music
3976000	3980000	because it's like poetry readings.
3980000	3983000	Yeah, art is subjective.
3983000	3985000	If you're going to call movies art, you have to call games art.
3985000	3989000	Honestly, because if you're going to call live theater art,
3989000	3991000	you've got to call movies art in a way.
3991000	3994000	So to me, especially with a game like Final Fantasy XII,
3994000	3998000	which feels like freaking Lord of the Rings epic when you play it,
3998000	4002000	you can't tell me that's not an art form like a movie.
4002000	4005000	Well, even the actual physical art that goes into it.
4005000	4007000	I mean, we had, what was the...
4007000	4012000	The bonus disc that has all the actual arts, like drawing art.
4012000	4014000	Or the gallery showings that had an E3.
4014000	4015000	Oh, sure.
4015000	4017000	Oh, the I.M. 8-bit and all that stuff.
4017000	4018000	That was that book I got you.
4018000	4019000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4019000	4021000	But that was the gallery too.
4021000	4023000	The pixel one too.
4023000	4024000	Well, you know where we're going with this.
4024000	4026000	Yeah, but yeah.
4026000	4029000	We got another email from Ricky that says,
4029000	4032000	Hi, DS Sky and Loki, how are you guys?
4032000	4034000	Well, thank you and well said.
4034000	4036000	This is a show I've been listening for a year now,
4036000	4038000	pop in the chatroom every now and then,
4038000	4041000	and would like to say thank you for all the times
4041000	4044000	where your long-running shows keep me entertained
4044000	4046000	through my travels on planes and long car trips.
4046000	4047000	You're welcome.
4047000	4049000	You guys pulled through for me as I waited for a wee
4049000	4051000	and did not manage to get one.
4051000	4053000	Many people asked what I was listening to
4053000	4055000	since I was sitting still for a few hours,
4055000	4057000	so I just had to tell them about your amazing show, of course.
4057000	4059000	Good PR, heh heh.
4059000	4060000	Thank you.
4060000	4061000	Good job.
4061000	4062000	The O.L. Army salutes you.
4062000	4065000	I have also spread the word at school to let O.L.R.
4065000	4067000	widely known amongst my fellow classmates.
4067000	4068000	I work on the school newspaper
4068000	4069000	and I write the entertainment column,
4069000	4071000	so I decided to spread some love.
4071000	4074000	I'm going to keep this short.
4074000	4076000	I have to study for exams, so peace and love to all.
4076000	4078000	That was very sweet.
4078000	4079000	That's it?
4079000	4082000	They just wrote to write in what the great PR they're doing?
4082000	4083000	Well, thank you.
4083000	4084000	I mean, we really appreciate that.
4084000	4085000	That's, you know, because, you know,
4085000	4087000	we do do this for free and all that stuff.
4087000	4090000	That's really if you feel like you want to give us something,
4090000	4093000	give us word of mouth because we don't have the luxury
4093000	4096000	of, you know, a corporate sibling magazine
4096000	4098000	that can run four-page ads, you know,
4098000	4100000	every month for our little dumb show
4100000	4103000	or, you know, we don't have the corporate tie-ins,
4103000	4106000	the companies that we rely on word of mouth
4106000	4108000	and things of that nature to get our name out there.
4108000	4110000	So if you feel like you want to give us something,
4110000	4112000	you don't have to give us your money.
4112000	4114000	Give us your word of mouth.
4114000	4115000	I'll tell you what, though.
4115000	4117000	Give us your loyalty and your soul.
4117000	4118000	I'll tell you what, Ricky.
4118000	4119000	If you shoot me an e-mail,
4119000	4120000	I'd actually like to see the newspaper.
4120000	4122000	So I will pay for the cost of the newspaper
4122000	4124000	and shipping via PayPal.
4124000	4125000	Sweet.
4125000	4127000	If you want to send me a copy so that we can see the article.
4127000	4128000	We want to see that, too.
4128000	4129000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4129000	4130000	We'll put it on the fridge.
4130000	4132000	Actually, we'll scan it in and put it up on the site.
4132000	4133000	If we can.
4133000	4134000	It could be a copyright thing.
4134000	4136000	If it's not copyrighted, we will.
4136000	4138000	We'll put it on the fridge, at least.
4138000	4139000	If it is, we'll seek permission.
4139000	4140000	All right.
4140000	4141000	Okay.
4141000	4143000	But I figured, yeah, I would really love to see that
4143000	4145000	and besides that, you know,
4145000	4148000	I want to encourage our young journalists
4148000	4151000	and good luck on your exams.
4151000	4153000	I have one from Anush.
4153000	4154000	It says,
4154000	4155000	Hi, Jamie, Rob, and Matt.
4155000	4158000	Rob, I was wondering if you guys will be doing an OLR meetup
4158000	4160000	like you did in New York City anyway.
4160000	4161000	Have a great show, you guys.
4161000	4162000	Where?
4162000	4164000	That's a good question.
4164000	4165000	I don't know.
4165000	4167000	Well, I guess there's going to be an opportunity
4167000	4169000	to talk about live appearances that we're doing.
4169000	4171000	Really, the next thing we have scheduled
4171000	4172000	is that we're going to do,
4172000	4173000	at least I'm going to be up for sure.
4173000	4176000	I don't know about my two partners in crime here.
4176000	4179000	I will be at Sakura Con in April in Seattle
4179000	4181000	and there's going to be at least hopefully one panel
4181000	4183000	that goes with that.
4183000	4186000	That's the only live thing I have scheduled for right now.
4186000	4188000	I may or may not be able to make it to Sakura Con.
4188000	4191000	If I travel in the next year like I did to New York City,
4191000	4194000	certainly I'll do some type of meetup.
4194000	4196000	It's a little too early to tell the places
4196000	4198000	that we're looking at right now.
4198000	4200000	My travel buddy, my best friend who I travel with all the time
4200000	4202000	and I are looking at,
4202000	4205000	I'm looking at possibly Toronto or Hawaii.
4205000	4208000	I know those are really strange choices
4208000	4210000	but we really want to go back to Canada
4210000	4211000	because we love Vancouver
4211000	4214000	and he's never been to Hawaii so I want to go to Hawaii.
4214000	4216000	I'm also planning, and this is still up in the air
4216000	4218000	as I have to find a good package deal and everything,
4218000	4224000	I'm planning for hopefully around Christmas, New Year 2007
4224000	4226000	of going to London.
4226000	4228000	I definitely want to do the UK at some point as well
4228000	4230000	and I know we have a lot of great listeners over there
4230000	4234000	who I'd love to meet up with for tea and crumpets at some point.
4234000	4237000	Well, for me it's going to be pub crawling.
4237000	4239000	Whatever. All right.
4239000	4241000	But anyway, yeah, that's...
4241000	4244000	Especially if you have anything in California,
4244000	4247000	Northern California, we can easily get to the Bay Area
4247000	4249000	and even Southern California to some extent
4249000	4252000	if you have something like a convention that you're planning or whatever,
4252000	4254000	we're definitely open to ideas.
4254000	4256000	We're not too diva.
4256000	4258000	Our list of demands is pretty low
4258000	4260000	so get in touch with one of us.
4260000	4262000	And of course I will be going to Alabama again.
4262000	4264000	Because we love to pimp out our show wherever we can.
4264000	4266000	But hopefully I'll be flying into New Orleans
4266000	4268000	so maybe I can do a meet up when I fly out there
4268000	4269000	and I'll let everybody know when I go.
4269000	4271000	And I go to Disneyland all the time.
4271000	4273000	So no one's found me yet.
4273000	4277000	Anyway, this next one is a very special email.
4277000	4280000	It comes from Kyle Snyder.
4280000	4282000	Dude, sweet. Kyle Snyder, for those who don't know,
4282000	4287000	we used to do pretty much exclusively a show about DDR.
4287000	4290000	So Kyle Freestyler for DDR.
4290000	4292000	Music writer extraordinaire.
4292000	4294000	Does music, his own stuff as well.
4294000	4297000	He's a bit of a celebrity amongst the...
4297000	4299000	He's like a DDR celeb.
4299000	4302000	He's like up there with the Mel Bs and the Mr. Wendels
4302000	4305000	and the folks you well know in the freestyle world.
4305000	4307000	Anyway, we still have the...
4307000	4309000	You know what?
4309000	4313000	People to this day still mimic that butterfly freestyle.
4313000	4315000	So you know what?
4315000	4317000	That's the ultimate compliment.
4317000	4319000	Imitation is the finest form of flattery.
4319000	4321000	William Hung of the DDR community.
4321000	4323000	I don't know.
4323000	4325000	I don't know if I like that comparison.
4325000	4326000	Sort of.
4326000	4327000	He's Kyle. That's it.
4327000	4328000	He's Kyle.
4328000	4329000	There is no other he's Kyle.
4329000	4331000	He disappeared for a little while, but now he's back.
4331000	4333000	Dear crew of OLR,
4333000	4337000	As you are aware, I have been back from my mission for almost two months.
4337000	4341000	I'm only going to be creating one more song on my current music mixing program
4341000	4343000	before I get a new and better one, Acid.
4343000	4347000	My new song should be up in about two weeks after the song
4347000	4350000	after I get a new music mixing program,
4350000	4353000	and my new music should hopefully sound better.
4353000	4357000	I'm planning on creating a remix to I Can Never Be Japanese,
4357000	4359000	most likely a happy hardcore remix.
4359000	4360000	That'll be fun, actually.
4360000	4363000	Is there anything you would like for me to work on for future songs
4363000	4366000	such as Eurobeat, Gabo, Electro, or any other genre?
4366000	4369000	I might not have a lot of time to create music starting mid-January
4369000	4371000	since I'll be starting college at that time.
4371000	4372000	One of your fans, Cal Snyder.
4372000	4374000	P.S. I plan to major in biotechnology.
4374000	4375000	Wow.
4375000	4377000	That's pretty hardcore. Good luck.
4380000	4382000	Do what makes you happy.
4382000	4384000	We don't want to tell you what music to do
4384000	4386000	because you should make the music that speaks to you.
4386000	4387000	But I will say this.
4387000	4389000	I can't say too much,
4389000	4394000	but I can say that a pretty well-known music franchise
4394000	4397000	is going to be doing a contest pretty soon where you can be in the game.
4397000	4398000	At least I think.
4398000	4400000	I think that's still being negotiated.
4400000	4404000	So I say save something really good for that
4404000	4406000	because I think you'd want to be in a video game, wouldn't you?
4406000	4407000	That's pretty cool.
4407000	4409000	And that goes for anybody out there who's making music.
4409000	4410000	My advice in this, actually,
4410000	4414000	because a lot of what goes in physical art goes into music art,
4414000	4417000	you know, go where your instincts lead you.
4417000	4418000	Don't stick to a style.
4418000	4420000	Experiment.
4420000	4423000	You know, even if it comes out like complete crap,
4423000	4427000	if you've learned something from it, then you've progressed.
4427000	4429000	That's what I have to say.
4429000	4432000	So, moving on.
4432000	4437000	We have one, actually, from the SoberIrishGuy.
4437000	4438000	That's cool.
4438000	4439000	The one.
4439000	4440000	The one.
4440000	4441000	Okay.
4441000	4444000	As first off, generic thanks and praise-like things from Ireland,
4444000	4448000	your show has landed onto the Irish scene.
4448000	4450000	Anyway, onto something important-ish.
4450000	4453000	I've been listening to the downloads and loving them for quite a while now,
4453000	4454000	but I need to make a request.
4454000	4456000	Every time you give release dates for the UK,
4456000	4458000	this is going to now be wired.
4458000	4459000	I see.
4459000	4460000	This is the email that inspired that.
4460000	4462000	I always think, well, that's not me.
4462000	4464000	And for the past 90 years, anyway.
4464000	4468000	Since you're always talking about European gamers
4468000	4471000	and how we keep getting screwed with release dates and Bahmani releases,
4471000	4473000	they don't actually exist over here.
4473000	4474000	Thanks a lot, Konami.
4474000	4477000	Any chance of getting European release dates?
4477000	4478000	I actually am working on it.
4478000	4480000	I need to find some sources.
4480000	4484000	What I'm thinking about doing is actually sending in some of my PR contacts
4484000	4486000	at some of the various companies
4486000	4488000	and seeing if they'll give me international release dates.
4488000	4492000	Keep in mind, guys, and trust us, we love our international listeners
4492000	4495000	and we love the fact that this little show that we do out of the spare bedroom
4495000	4497000	goes everywhere, everywhere in the world.
4497000	4499000	That's the ultimate compliment.
4499000	4501000	But keep in mind, we can't do everybody
4501000	4503000	because India just got the 360,
4503000	4505000	so they've probably got their own release dates,
4505000	4507000	and I'm sure we've got at least one listener there.
4507000	4509000	I'd love to do those release dates, too.
4509000	4512000	We would do a show of nothing but release dates.
4512000	4513000	But we'll try.
4513000	4515000	We'll try to do at least the big titles for some places.
4515000	4518000	My idea for this is to do quarterly updates
4518000	4522000	for major countries like, for example, for India,
4522000	4525000	for South America, for Africa.
4525000	4526000	Africa.
4526000	4528000	Sorry, I couldn't pass that up.
4528000	4531000	I hear there's new screenshots of Africa out there on the interweb.
4531000	4536000	Well, also, though, for any place that's got similar dates but deviations,
4536000	4539000	I'm going to actually try doing different compilations for my list
4539000	4542000	and seeing if I can't be a little more accommodating.
4542000	4544000	I'm doing my best, guys.
4544000	4547000	We'll do what we can, but we do appreciate your suggestion
4547000	4549000	and listening to us in other countries.
4549000	4553000	He also addressed another part to me about Aragon.
4553000	4554000	Really?
4554000	4557000	Because you know I was complaining about how poorly written the book is.
4557000	4562000	Basically, to go into the rest of this email,
4562000	4565000	it says, I've read Aragon, and while it did start a little badly written,
4565000	4567000	I enjoyed it, but then again, I've read a lot of fantasy,
4567000	4570000	both bad and good, Dragonlance and Discworld, respectively.
4570000	4573000	I actually like Dragonlance, but I also played a lot of D&D
4573000	4575000	when I was into Dragonlance.
4575000	4578000	Aragon is a bit slow-paced, and the overall story is good,
4578000	4581000	even if the writing isn't terribly great.
4581000	4585000	I have been getting some feedback on the book,
4585000	4589000	just from my friends' local emails I've gotten.
4589000	4592000	I have started reading it again,
4592000	4597000	even though I've been distracted by copious amounts of Doctor Who
4597000	4601000	and the fact that I'm into reading historical biography now
4601000	4604000	and anthropology books.
4604000	4606000	I'll set some time aside for it.
4606000	4607000	I'll give it another chance.
4607000	4609000	This story could be better than the writing.
4609000	4614000	I've read worse fan fiction, so I'm going to give it a go.
4614000	4618000	In closing, it says, anyhow, that's it from this side of the Atlantic.
4618000	4621000	Keep up the show and keep uploading it.
4621000	4626000	D&D 9 is not a good time to be awake.
4626000	4630000	I also sort of want to wake up in the middle of the morning
4630000	4634000	for myself and say, hey, overseas people, listen to me,
4634000	4639000	because I am randomly awake on the weekends that early.
4639000	4641000	Moving forward, the last email comes...
4641000	4643000	Oh, I just want to say real quickly,
4643000	4646000	some of our tape shows, such as the new STFU show that's not live,
4646000	4650000	it's taped, we might actually play those at an hour
4650000	4652000	that would be friendly for the folks overseas.
4652000	4654000	We are exploring doing that, because it's really easy for us
4654000	4656000	to do the rebroadcast of the tape shows,
4656000	4659000	so something to look forward to.
4659000	4664000	Last one comes from Robert.
4664000	4665000	I really missed you guys this week.
4665000	4667000	I like your name, Robert.
4667000	4669000	Aww, thank you for missing us.
4669000	4672000	Anyway, I've just unlocked the first bonus mission on Elite Beat Agents,
4672000	4676000	and although I'm nowhere near ready to say I'm all that good at the game yet,
4676000	4678000	I was wondering if there's a soundtrack mode
4678000	4680000	or audio test mode unlockable in the game
4680000	4682000	to listen to the music outside of the game.
4682000	4687000	It's amazing the amount of digital audio they were able to fit into that cartridge.
4687000	4689000	I don't know of any.
4689000	4693000	I'm sure someone might figure out a little hack or crack for the cartridge.
4693000	4698000	I would say, honestly, the songs are so close to their originals that,
4698000	4699000	well, not always.
4699000	4702000	Some are sped up, like a couple of songs are sped up,
4702000	4704000	so I guess I could see why you'd want that.
4704000	4705000	You never know.
4705000	4708000	Some folks are able to creatively rip from the game.
4708000	4710000	Some people do that.
4710000	4712000	Check some of those various sound archive sites,
4712000	4714000	especially for those really big in import games.
4714000	4715000	I'll bet you see something.
4715000	4717000	You know what we had to do back in the 80s?
4717000	4721000	We held up our boombox to our TVs and recorded it, and we liked it.
4721000	4723000	That might be how you have to do it.
4723000	4724000	I don't know.
4724000	4725000	So that's it.
4725000	4726000	That was it.
4726000	4727000	No more emails?
4727000	4728000	No more.
4728000	4729000	How sad.
4729000	4730000	That's all right.
4730000	4731000	Send us more.
4731000	4732000	Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.
4732000	4733000	We love to hear from you.
4733000	4736000	Someone who doesn't like to hear from you so much is Capcom.
4736000	4742000	They totally ignore the folks who are bitching about dead rising text being too small,
4742000	4746000	and I guess in a way I'm teasing them a little bit, but what could they really do?
4746000	4749000	I mean, do you think that is something that really could have been patched?
4749000	4750000	That's a pretty big game element.
4750000	4753000	I don't think that's something that could have been delivered in an itty bitty patch,
4753000	4755000	so I think they realized they botched it there,
4755000	4757000	or at least I thought they realized they botched it there.
4757000	4759000	Then the Lost Planet demo came out,
4759000	4762000	and I haven't played it yet, but I've seen pictures of it,
4762000	4764000	and yes, the text, once again, uber small,
4764000	4767000	but this time they've changed it.
4767000	4770000	Folks were bitching on the Internet about the small text,
4770000	4773000	and so Capcom sent out some screenshots and said,
4773000	4776000	hey, listen you jerks who keep bashing us.
4776000	4777000	We fixed it.
4777000	4779000	Here's a screenshot to prove it.
4779000	4784000	Remember that beta games and test games are not always indicative of the final release.
4784000	4790000	STFU, bitches, in so many words, is what they said.
4790000	4794000	But their last game, which pretty much is their only game on the 360 right now,
4794000	4797000	had small text, and that was indicative of the demo,
4797000	4799000	so what do you expect?
4799000	4803000	I mean, they're just going based off of their prior track record.
4803000	4806000	Well, I'm sure Capcom's learned their lesson.
4806000	4809000	Well, good. I'm glad it took them only one game to do that.
4809000	4811000	So, you know, that's always good.
4811000	4813000	I guess I'm spoiled because I am an HDTV owner,
4813000	4816000	and I didn't find the text in Dead Rising to be that bad.
4816000	4817000	It wasn't that bad.
4817000	4818000	It wasn't that bad at all.
4818000	4823000	Yeah, but again, you have Mondo, Hugh Joe TV in the living room,
4823000	4825000	and you have a TV that's bigger than mine, too,
4825000	4828000	so we're all spoiled, you know, for our friends on standard TVs.
4828000	4830000	Dead Rising on a standard TV, too.
4830000	4831000	Really? You didn't think it was a pain in the ass?
4831000	4832000	No.
4832000	4833000	Blurry?
4833000	4835000	The only thing I noticed was my monitor's too dark,
4835000	4838000	so I can't see anything when it turns night.
4838000	4840000	Then people just complain too much. I don't know what to tell you.
4840000	4841000	But, whatever.
4841000	4843000	So anyways, issues that need to be ironed out.
4843000	4849000	Well, apparently the new movie and TV download service for Microsoft's Xbox 360
4849000	4852000	has a little bit of some issues there.
4852000	4855000	For example, the movie downloads.
4855000	4858000	Way too damn slow.
4858000	4860000	I haven't really tried it yet, because I don't really...
4860000	4862000	Neither have I. There's not a damn thing on there I want.
4862000	4866000	Yeah, it's just, you know, maybe if I miss an episode of something, I don't know, but...
4866000	4869000	I was going to get Star Trek Generations, but then it wasn't in HD,
4869000	4871000	so I was like, well, pfft, forget it.
4871000	4873000	I only want to do this because it has HD movies.
4873000	4878000	So, bring me more HD movies I'm interested in, and I'll maybe take a look.
4878000	4882000	I've also heard issues of people downloading stuff and getting something else.
4882000	4886000	But apparently, they are going about to fix this stuff,
4886000	4891000	and I guess for the first initial downloads, if you did download something or whatever,
4891000	4894000	or tried to download something, and got your credits taken away,
4894000	4898000	and weren't able to download it, they will be refunding you your points and stuff.
4898000	4901000	So, it's a work in progress.
4901000	4906000	But, once again, they really need to test this stuff before they go and release it.
4906000	4908000	It's like a lot of the games, you know?
4908000	4911000	Oh, it goes out, and oh, by the way, the...
4911000	4916000	Can you really test thousands of people downloading your movie at once, though?
4916000	4919000	Yeah, it's called an online beta test.
4919000	4922000	They have stress tests. That's what they do.
4922000	4928000	That's what a stress test is, to test to see if your servers can handle people downloading stuff.
4928000	4931000	I remember when I was testing Test Drive Unlimited,
4931000	4935000	they would have you, okay, we need everybody to go to this one spot and start a race.
4935000	4940000	We're going to see if this spot can handle the stress test of thousands of people doing that.
4940000	4943000	And that's what they do. They specifically try to break it.
4943000	4947000	And, obviously, they're just not testing it enough.
4947000	4948000	And same with the network play.
4948000	4953000	How the fuck are you playing Call of Duty 3 or something like that not know,
4953000	4957000	especially after the last one, that the online play is going to be laggy as fuck,
4957000	4962000	and you release the game anyways to make it there for the holiday rush.
4962000	4966000	You know right away that it's not going to work, but you're just planning on patching it later.
4966000	4970000	It's kind of like, oh well, whatever, it's good enough for now, you know, we'll patch it later.
4970000	4973000	People will buy it anyways, and they do.
4973000	4976000	Because how are they supposed to know?
4976000	4978000	That's ridiculous.
4978000	4984000	Well, speaking of the other things that are going to be available, at least online and beta testing,
4984000	4988000	there is going to be a beta test for Halo 3, a public beta.
4988000	4998000	The signup begins on the 4th, that's this Monday, so people will already be listening by that point, hopefully.
4998000	5006000	But you would have to go to Halo3.com on Monday and start your signup.
5006000	5013000	They're basically saying that Halo 3 beta will be available in the US, Europe, other places internationally,
5013000	5016000	and they are going to keep the updates through that site.
5016000	5020000	So that's good, but if you don't manage to get in on that though,
5020000	5024000	there are going to be premium multiplayer maps for Halo 2 coming out as well.
5024000	5026000	This is going to be available in the spring.
5026000	5030000	And there's going to be more info on the beta in the next coming weeks according to our Microsoft reps.
5030000	5035000	We bugged him when we first saw this, we were like, how can you get us in?
5035000	5039000	Have you bugged him about that whole March release date? Is that what they're still sticking to?
5039000	5041000	No, he wasn't the one that told you that though, right?
5041000	5044000	He wasn't the one that told me that. I haven't bugged him yet about that.
5044000	5048000	Well, just to say, I am going to try to sign up for the beta.
5048000	5053000	Can we? Doesn't this show disqualify us from that? Or are you just all going to lie?
5053000	5057000	Well, we don't get paid for it, so...
5057000	5061000	I signed up for the Shadowrun beta, which is also this week, for the 360,
5061000	5064000	so that might be another one if you want to try to get in on something.
5064000	5066000	That's another thing that's going on too.
5066000	5069000	Well, it's sort of a part of it. We're going to get reports on it anyway, is how I see it.
5069000	5071000	But my whole thing is, I love beta testing.
5071000	5074000	Well, I tried to sign up for a beta test, and the first question they asked was,
5074000	5076000	do you work for a gaming website or whatever?
5076000	5079000	I thought, yeah, because that's kind of what we do here, and it booted me.
5079000	5082000	No, no, no. Work implies that you get paid.
5082000	5083000	I guess that's true.
5083000	5085000	Therefore, I do not work in the hobby.
5085000	5088000	The way the question was worded, I wanted to...
5088000	5092000	I'm not going to lie, but just for a silly beta test,
5092000	5095000	the way it was worded, and I don't want to say what site it was for,
5095000	5098000	but it was a pretty major gaming operation,
5098000	5101000	I was signing up, and it booted me right out for that.
5101000	5104000	I've gotten selected for quite a few beta tests lately.
5104000	5107000	I've actually gotten selected for betas through...
5107000	5110000	Well, fuck you and fuck you, because I don't get paid for anything.
5110000	5112000	Through the media mailings, because I'll have the media send out.
5112000	5114000	I did the Phantasy Star Universe beta. I guess that's something.
5114000	5116000	Everybody did that, though.
5116000	5117000	All right, whatever.
5117000	5118000	I didn't do that.
5118000	5120000	I'll look. If I can sign up, I will.
5120000	5122000	If not, I'm not going to lose sleep over it.
5122000	5123000	Whatever.
5123000	5124000	Whatever.
5124000	5128000	One thing I am pretty interested in checking out on Xbox
5128000	5133000	would be Double Dragon coming to Xbox Live with a full co-op mode,
5133000	5137000	and this report coming from the official Xbox magazine in the UK.
5137000	5139000	Only 12.5 megabytes for the game.
5139000	5143000	I'm assuming this is based off of not the well-known Nintendo version,
5143000	5147000	but the arcade release that I believe Tecmos put out.
5147000	5150000	I'm guessing, because most of the Xbox games have been their arcade counterpart,
5150000	5153000	and I just don't see an NES game showing up on the Xbox.
5153000	5155000	So, going to be the arcade version, I'm sure.
5155000	5159000	Online co-op, probably be pretty cool, as long as it's not laggy as hell,
5159000	5160000	so I hope you did your stress test.
5160000	5165000	Yeah, I was going to say, as long as it's able to stay synced, unlike Contra.
5165000	5167000	So.
5167000	5169000	I still haven't played Contra online.
5169000	5171000	I don't, nope, none of my friends have it.
5171000	5172000	I'm like the only one of my friends unless it hasn't.
5172000	5173000	I have Contra.
5173000	5174000	Do you? Let's play!
5174000	5176000	Let's get some achievements online!
5176000	5177000	Points!
5177000	5179000	That's all.
5179000	5181000	Are you sure?
5181000	5182000	Yep.
5182000	5184000	Are you sure you're sure?
5184000	5185000	Yes.
5185000	5187000	Okay, okay, okay.
5187000	5191000	Well, anyway, Microsoft, speaking of which,
5191000	5197000	has decided that they are going to release the 1080p fix.
5197000	5200000	It's a dashboard update.
5200000	5204000	Basically, you are going to, when you log into Xbox Live,
5204000	5207000	the patch is supposed to fix everything.
5207000	5211000	You don't have to download the update, but you can't connect to Live until you do.
5211000	5214000	I was going to say, I don't think, yeah, because I was trying,
5214000	5217000	I got the patch last night when I was playing one of those Burger King games,
5217000	5219000	and it made me do it, so.
5219000	5222000	But I'm pretty much always on Live, so.
5222000	5226000	Well, it's also trying to also improve the accuracy of the reporting on things.
5226000	5229000	You'll see changes to your recently played games.
5229000	5231000	Oh, interesting.
5231000	5232000	Alright, cool.
5232000	5235000	I couldn't tell you what it did for 1080p, though, because my TV doesn't support it, so.
5235000	5242000	Well, it's supposed to also have improved plug and play for your headsets and the wireless controllers.
5242000	5244000	Again, something I don't have.
5244000	5247000	It's also supposed to fix some VGA cable stuff, too.
5247000	5249000	Now, you have that. You could try that, I guess.
5249000	5252000	Yeah, but I don't have a TV that does 1080p with VGA cables.
5252000	5254000	Oh, there you go.
5254000	5256000	Alright.
5256000	5259000	Anyways, so one thing I'm kind of a little sad about,
5259000	5264000	and so far I haven't really tried it, so I'm not really sure if this has affected anything yet,
5264000	5273000	but apparently Microsoft is taking precautions and blocking some of the Europe Live users
5273000	5281000	that are using the region workaround to be able to download demos that are available to the US.
5281000	5286000	And apparently they are blocking the accounts, not necessarily banning them.
5286000	5292000	And I've done this over here to download Japanese demos and stuff, and it's fun.
5292000	5297000	But so far they've only confirmed that they've been blocking the UK ones.
5297000	5301000	They've been blocking them from downloading our demos and whatnot.
5301000	5304000	Apparently some licensing issues or something. I don't know.
5304000	5307000	But whatever.
5307000	5309000	We're next.
5309000	5311000	We're not next. We're spoiled.
5311000	5315000	But I don't know. I haven't tried it yet, so we'll see.
5315000	5317000	I guess we'll see.
5317000	5320000	Now, this was causing some rumors to go around that they were banning people, right?
5320000	5323000	But then they came out and said, no, we're not banning anyone, just blocking.
5323000	5327000	Yeah, it's just blocking people, because really they're just silver accounts anyway,
5327000	5330000	so I mean, yeah, sure, go ahead, ban the silver account.
5330000	5332000	You can't just create a new one.
5332000	5336000	Folks are starting rumors that, oh, your gold that's on the same system is going to get banned too,
5336000	5338000	and I'm like, that would cause problems.
5338000	5340000	They're just going to say, no, we don't want money.
5340000	5342000	Right.
5342000	5351000	Well, regardless, the mere idea that we're going to be robbed from checking out the Japanese and other international demos
5351000	5353000	has our feathers ruffled a little bit,
5353000	5356000	because we love to import here at Orange Launch Radio from our friends in Japan
5356000	5358000	and occasionally other countries too when they get stuff we want,
5358000	5361000	and so I feel a little bit angsty about this news,
5361000	5373000	so I think it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.
5373000	5374000	Yes, that's right, kids.
5374000	5376000	This is the part of the show where we get ranty and angsty,
5376000	5382000	and who better to start us off when it comes to rants and angst than Dark Sakura?
5382000	5387000	Amazingly enough, I am not angsty about anything today.
5387000	5391000	I'm not ranty. I'm on new medication.
5391000	5394000	Hell froze over, ladies and gentlemen. It's happened.
5394000	5396000	Somebody's skiing in hell right now.
5396000	5398000	Jamie's not angsty, and I'm just fucking with you.
5398000	5399000	No.
5399000	5400000	I'm glad to hear things are such really happy.
5400000	5403000	We finally found a treatment that's helping me with my chronic disease.
5403000	5406000	Anyone who's a fetal chosen is a chronic disease girl.
5406000	5410000	But it's finally gotten something that helps, so I'm not really all that upset about much.
5410000	5416000	I'm pretty happy, actually, except for the person who took my blood at Kaiser.
5416000	5419000	You freaking always leave bruises on me.
5419000	5423000	Because, like, plot, plot, blood, out.
5423000	5425000	Fine, but what about the bruise on my arm?
5425000	5427000	Oh, will you do that anyway?
5427000	5429000	Because she's taken my blood a couple times before.
5429000	5432000	Like, whatever, lady.
5432000	5437000	Just, whatever. I don't like walking around looking like a freaking heroin addict or something.
5437000	5439000	So, that's it.
5439000	5440000	Lucky.
5440000	5447000	Um, F.U. to my lower back right now. It's apparently a way my bed's situated in our bedroom.
5447000	5452000	Um, I'm next to the window, and the window, because it's in an apartment, has horrible seals.
5452000	5458000	So, like, everything that's on the backside of my body, like, my neck, my back, and everything are completely sore right now.
5458000	5464000	It feels like I was in a fight or something, but it's just from the cold air because it's winter.
5464000	5465000	It sucks.
5465000	5471000	So, I feel like an old person, like, oh, my back!
5471000	5476000	Uh, I'm relatively in good spirits as well, so I'll just have to say F.U. to being so busy.
5476000	5481000	Because, you know, it's the reason why I have to pre-tape tonight, and I got, you know,
5481000	5485000	like, four different things I'm doing today and more I'm doing tomorrow.
5485000	5488000	But it's hard for me to complain too much because I have Monday off work.
5488000	5496000	So, you know, I guess F.U. to the crowds at the mall I'll be fighting because I guess I'm going to try and do some holiday shopping during that time.
5496000	5500000	So, we'll see. We'll see.
5500000	5503000	Wow, I'm glad to hear everyone's in relatively good spirits.
5503000	5506000	Hey, this will put some of our listeners in even better spirits.
5506000	5509000	We have a story about lesbians.
5509000	5510000	Yay!
5510000	5513000	Alright, lesbians, hooray!
5513000	5518000	There was this story ran on this site called gamesradar.com,
5518000	5524000	which I guess is actually some corporate website, but I'd never heard of it until this story, so whatever.
5524000	5532000	They are going over the top seven lesbian kisses in video games ever.
5532000	5537000	Let's see, it started off with number seven was Kitana and Mileena with their fatalities, right?
5537000	5541000	Because remember how Kitana would kiss Mileena and then she'd blow up and then, you know, all that stuff.
5541000	5544000	Or that Mileena would kiss Kitana and then like suck her in and that's it.
5544000	5546000	She'd eat her face or something.
5546000	5552000	Jade Empire came in at number six with their little girl on girl action on the eve of battle.
5552000	5557000	And they have a little hot picture to go with it there, so if you're into lesbians you might like that.
5557000	5559000	I like this one here. This is probably my favorite of the whole series.
5559000	5564000	Outlaw Golf 2 for the Xbox and Playstation 2.
5564000	5573000	This would be when Summer, who is a stripper in the original Outlaw Golf, she gets with her partner Autumn
5573000	5578000	and they do this whole girl on girl thing and it's pretty hot, I guess, if you're into lesbians.
5578000	5588000	Number four was from Fear Effect 2 Retro Helix, which was, you know, kind of an older game for Playstation 1 on 2001.
5588000	5594000	And there's this chick Hannah and her applied lover Rain.
5594000	5598000	They do a make out in an elevator to distract some guards.
5598000	5601000	No nudity involved though.
5601000	5605000	The number three hottest lesbian kiss in video games ever from GamesRadar.com.
5605000	5609000	They said that Persephone and Niobe in Enter the Matrix.
5609000	5614000	I remember that one because I actually played Enter the Matrix on, I think it was GameCube.
5614000	5622000	And I remember that scene. So that's some Monica Bellucci and Jada Pinkett action there in your live action clip.
5622000	5632000	And then in Leisure Suit Larry Magna Cum Laude from the character Luba who likes to get naked and make out with chicks at number two.
5632000	5634000	I remember playing that game.
5634000	5641000	And the number one lesbian kiss game, Sims 2 with the do it yourself make outs.
5641000	5650000	And they show a little clip here from the Sims 2 of some, you know, girls in scantily clad bikinis all over each other on their leopard print bed.
5650000	5655000	Now wait a minute. There is another game though I know that they had. It was full nudity and everything.
5655000	5661000	I can't remember what it was called though because it was some other Sims like knock off game.
5661000	5667000	And I remember they were doing a thing on somethingawful.com.
5667000	5673000	They were kind of reviewing the game and talking about how he would make his characters force them to be gay.
5673000	5675000	Against their will type thing.
5675000	5681000	Interesting. You know what I'm trying to think? Well, okay, where's the list of the top seven gay male kisses ever?
5681000	5684000	And I'm like, God, I can't hardly think of any games that have that.
5684000	5686000	Bully, Final Fantasy VII, I guess.
5686000	5687000	What?
5687000	5691000	Wasn't there a part with like the whole gay thing in there?
5691000	5693000	There was the Barret Date.
5693000	5696000	Oh, the Barret Date. That doesn't count.
5696000	5698000	I've got the Barret Date.
5698000	5700000	There's no making out action in the Barret Date.
5700000	5703000	What it is, some Japanese player decided to get the Barret Date.
5703000	5712000	And so back when the Dex drive was really big and I downloaded a Dex file, translated it for the US one and played it on my game.
5712000	5715000	And it was funny. It was really funny.
5715000	5716000	Interesting.
5716000	5719000	The Yuffie one was stupid. I've seen the Yuffie one as well.
5719000	5721000	I hate Aerith so all I've done myself is...
5721000	5725000	I'm pretty sure when I played through the game that's who I went on the date with was Aerith.
5725000	5726000	She sucks.
5726000	5727000	I liked her.
5727000	5730000	She's dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.
5730000	5735000	But she'll always be talked about through flashbacks so screw you, hippie.
5735000	5737000	Anyways, so speaking of...
5737000	5744000	Oh, by the way, I want to say if anyone from GamesRadar is listening, I hope you weren't hurt that I didn't know your website but most people don't know us so we're used to it.
5744000	5750000	But you should do the top seven gay guy kisses next for us to report on next week.
5750000	5758000	So anyways, speaking of games that are out there that kind of are interesting.
5758000	5761000	There's a new Bubble Bubble game coming out for the DS.
5761000	5764000	Bubble Bubble Doubleshot has been announced.
5764000	5772000	It's a co-op dinosaur game and of course hopefully we'll have a level 30 boss.
5772000	5775000	I know, I was like, must refrain from joke, must refrain from joke.
5775000	5778000	Oh, I can't! Is there going to be a boss in level 30, you stupids?
5778000	5787000	It's slated for quarter one of 2007 and honestly I can say I think we've had enough Bubble Bubble titles in the last, you know, year.
5787000	5791000	Yeah, I know. I love Bubble Bubble but damn. Damn.
5791000	5796000	Oh, that was another one that came out I forgot to mention that's coming out next week here.
5796000	5798000	Bubble Bubble Evolution for the PSP.
5798000	5800000	Whoopee!
5800000	5802000	Yeah, so...
5802000	5804000	Hooray.
5804000	5810000	Alright, something else that will be coming to you very soon is Dark Sakura's website of the week.
5810000	5816000	She serves the internet all over to look for a website that she wants to share with you and she has one for you right now.
5816000	5817000	It's her website of the week.
5817000	5820000	Dark Sakura, tell the kids what it is.
5820000	5825000	This is a website that I'm sure everybody knows about and it's about damn time I mentioned it.
5825000	5828000	Today's website of the week is 4chan.org.
5828000	5831000	The number 4, C-H-A-N dot O-R-G.
5831000	5836000	4chan, where the internet also goes to die when it's not at MySpace.
5836000	5839000	Home of Caturday.
5839000	5850000	Home of lots of lovely, lovely Yowie and Yuri and Bunch of Hentai and Mecha and all kinds of art.
5850000	5851000	Cosplay.
5851000	5852000	You wanna know something funny?
5852000	5853000	What?
5853000	5858000	I've never been to this site. I hear about it all the time but I just have never thought to go to it.
5858000	5859000	Ugh.
5859000	5861000	Isn't that weird?
5861000	5864000	4chan has lots of fun but I love Caturday.
5864000	5867000	That sounds worthy of a visitation.
5867000	5874000	Also though on 4chan, the other cool thing is the Oikaki board where basically you draw.
5874000	5883000	Oh, weren't those really huge on the internet a couple years ago where you'd have the paint program basically and you could save your paint and post it?
5883000	5885000	Yeah, that was huge a few years ago.
5885000	5890000	My very first Oikaki that I ever did was of Leifmon.
5890000	5894000	I don't like that name. That sounds too close to Bu-E-Kake.
5894000	5895000	No, that's Bu-Kake.
5895000	5898000	I know it's Bu-Kake but it's close.
5898000	5900000	Bu-Kake and Oikaki, I should say.
5900000	5904000	O-E-Kake, not Bu-Kake.
5904000	5908000	Although you will find lots of Bu-Kake on 4chan.
5908000	5909000	Hooray.
5909000	5911000	And it has an IRC channel so yeah.
5911000	5918000	I like 4chan. I'm sorry, there's some really horrible, stupid stuff on 4chan but I love 4chan.
5918000	5920000	Alright, visit it then.
5920000	5925000	If you're like me and you've never bothered to, I guess you can go visit it.
5925000	5933000	Alright, now what's interesting is that there's some rumors going around about what's coming up with Final Fantasy 6 on the Game Boy Advance.
5933000	5939000	It's kind of rumor status because it was reported that you're going to be able to have the new characters.
5939000	5944000	You can do Leo and you can play as Emperor Geshtal too, which I thought was a very strange character addition.
5944000	5947000	Usually in these Game Boy releases the games they add new stuff.
5947000	5950000	But now they're saying, no, it was all faked.
5950000	5956000	Somebody did a really good Photoshop job or a ROM hack job to get Leo and all that stuff in Geshtal in your party.
5956000	5958000	So it's not true.
5958000	5961000	So I guess we won't really know until the game comes out.
5961000	5968000	However, it does appear that the summons, having new summons in the game, Gilgamesh, Sabertender,
5968000	5970000	they will actually be there.
5970000	5977000	So at least you'll have that something extra, even if the fangirl fantasy of reviving Leo may in fact not be true.
5977000	5981000	How hard would it be to just let them revive Leo already?
5981000	5988000	But I have to admit, when I read the story it did sound a little bit too good to be true that it was going to be the Phoenix Esper that revived him.
5988000	5992000	I'm kind of like, well, that almost sounds a little too cliche.
5992000	5994000	I don't know.
5994000	5999000	I still would want to check this out, though, because Final Fantasy VI, good game.
5999000	6000000	Very good game.
6000000	6001000	Interesting.
6001000	6011000	Well, Elibits, which is coming out here in a couple weeks, is actually going to be having some Wii Connect 24 functionality, including level trading.
6011000	6016000	The custom levels are going to be used, basically built with a point system.
6016000	6025000	The points are charged for each item used to populate the level, including trash cans, Elibits, toy tanks, etc.
6025000	6028000	It says no level can exceed 1,000 points.
6028000	6034000	Basically, the levels can be sent to your friends with screenshots.
6034000	6037000	And it's kind of a neat little thing.
6037000	6043000	Probably the first game I've seen actually utilize the Wii Connect 24 system, so looking forward to that.
6043000	6044000	Picking it up anyways.
6044000	6048000	Yeah, Elibits is one of those games that at E3 you were kind of like, eh, whatever.
6048000	6054000	And then we heard more and more about it, and you and I were lucky enough to see it at the Konami thingy and all that.
6054000	6056000	And the game's progressed along nicely.
6056000	6059000	Now I'm definitely interested in picking it up.
6059000	6061000	I think there's other people that feel the same way, too.
6061000	6063000	And this Wii Connect 24 sounds very cool.
6063000	6068000	And I think a lot of people will be picking it up probably just so they can participate in that.
6068000	6070000	It'll be interesting to see what happens.
6070000	6074000	Well, that was the last story that we had for you guys tonight.
6074000	6079000	Unfortunately, we have no Skype line tonight because we're not actually live.
6079000	6086000	But we will be back live next week at Orange Lounge Radio and, of course, inviting your calls as always and your participation.
6086000	6090000	I'm sure a lot of you have some built-up stuff, having no show last week and now a taped show this week.
6090000	6093000	But is there any last-minute stuff from Loki or Dark Saga?
6093000	6095000	Yeah, I've got a couple things.
6095000	6097000	I do as well.
6097000	6100000	Well, let's start off with Dark Saga. Why don't you start us off?
6100000	6112000	Just for UK news, for Football Manager 2007, Sega and Sports Interactive released a patch for the PC, Mac, and Intel Mac versions of Football Manager 2007.
6112000	6120000	Basically, the patch deals with some of the issues that the fans brought up, like some of the bugs that were still in the game.
6120000	6128000	The patch is saved game compatible, but to get the full effect, you have to start a new game.
6128000	6135000	You can actually grab it from Sports Interactive's website over there.
6135000	6138000	I know it's kind of a big game over there, so I thought I'd bring it up.
6138000	6140000	All right.
6140000	6146000	If you're looking to use your old Nintendo and Super Nintendo controllers with the Wii Virtual Console games,
6146000	6153000	there's a website called RetroZone, which is at RetroUSB.com.
6153000	6157000	This stuff is actually going to be slash Wii dot HTML.
6157000	6162000	You can buy both the adapters for the NES and Super NES controllers.
6162000	6169000	Those are priced at $19 each, including if you buy a second controller, it will have free shipping.
6169000	6171000	That's kind of neat.
6171000	6176000	You would actually plug into your GameCube ports on the Wii, so that's pretty cool.
6176000	6185000	And then finally, apparently there's that hacking group Team Executor that was famous for a lot of the PSP stuff.
6185000	6192000	They've got the full-size SATA hard drive working with the PlayStation 3,
6192000	6196000	and now they have 750 gigabytes on their one PlayStation 3.
6196000	6198000	For what? For what?
6198000	6202000	For what you may say, well, they're working on running the Blu-ray game.
6202000	6205000	For porn. For 750 gigs of porn on your PS3.
6205000	6208000	For running the Blu-ray games off the hard drive.
6208000	6211000	All right. I see. Interesting.
6211000	6212000	So that's it.
6212000	6216000	All right. Well, that's going to do it then for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
6216000	6219000	Hey, we want to thank you guys for still tuning into us and supporting us,
6219000	6221000	even though we weren't here last week.
6221000	6224000	We're a little bit shorter this week with only one part,
6224000	6230000	but you know we love you guys out there on the Internet for listening to us and supporting independent Internet radio,
6230000	6233000	and we will be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6233000	6236000	Two parts live and the usual stuff.
6236000	6239000	We've missed it, so we'll be seeing you guys next week.
6239000	6245000	Until then, on behalf of Jamie Summers and Loki, have a great night.
6245000	6246000	We didn't do final thoughts.
6246000	6248000	Oh, crap. We didn't do final thoughts.
6248000	6249000	My bad.
6249000	6250000	My bad.
6250000	6251000	Okay, quick. Final thoughts.
6251000	6252000	DarkSaga, Jamie Summers.
6252000	6253000	Money.
6253000	6254000	Loki.
6254000	6257000	I think I'm going to call my new show Screwdriver.
6257000	6259000	I want pumpkin pie.
6259000	6288000	Good night.
6289000	6299000	Good night.
