14207	19288	Tonight, December 3rd, 2006, did corporate shuffles at Sony tell us the future of PS3?
19348	22029	Halo 3 releases beta information?
22369	25150	And did Capcom finally listen to complaints on small text?
27791	37734	Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37794	39735	That's right, we're back after having...
40242	42364	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
65062	67863	I'm supposed to still be asleep right now.
67903	69163	Does 12.30 count as morning?
69223	69803	Probably not.
69843	70484	It's more afternoon.
70524	71604	But for us, on a Saturday, it's morning.
71624	72304	Morning is perception.
72484	73024	Exactly.
73845	76925	Say hello to another not-so-morning person, Loki.
77826	78366	I'm awake.
78786	79186	I know.
79326	79946	You're up and at them.
80386	81547	We just all ate, too.
81567	83527	We had a nice company brunch.
83947	84628	It was fun.
85808	88409	You count my hard-boiled egg and potato pancakes.
89309	89849	It was good stuff.
90225	96268	Anyway, so we're well fed and ready to give you guys your own dosage of gaming news for the week.
96828	99670	But we always like to start it off with a little bit of how was your gaming week?
99710	103272	And since, you know, we weren't here last week, again, sorry about that.
103332	115158	But we had plans to pre-tape last week for the holiday and they got kind of screwed up by sickness or traffic because it took me about seven and a half hours to make a drive that you can usually be done in five.
115838	117459	And things along that nature, so...
118104	119265	We kind of got messed up.
119305	123187	So sorry about that, guys, that we're looking forward to a new show last week.
123267	137754	But, you know, considering that most shows like to rerun themselves into the ground, like the type you see on TV and maybe traditional radio, and the fact that otherwise I think we've been pretty good about giving new content every single week on the podcast.
137794	139335	I think one week off isn't going to kill us.
139575	142176	So anyway, enough about that.
142216	143557	Everyone got a good dose of Travis.
144198	144638	That's true.
144678	151724	Well, those that were listening live on Sunday got our lovely Travis who does the Saturday show on our live station.
152785	153045	All right.
153506	154646	Let's talk about gaming weeks.
155527	157489	Thanksgiving and the week after and all that stuff.
157529	158089	DarkSakura.
158610	168838	Well, Dan and I have been playing Zelda, but we're sort of holding off on it until we get our component cables because we want it to be nice and big and pretty on our TV.
169679	171240	I feel exactly the same way I do.
173140	174961	I'm not playing it until it's very, very pretty.
175541	180163	Well, I'm actually, for me, it's the story, because I adore the story, you know.
180644	184126	But Dan's like, oh, graphics, I'm like, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
184946	186887	Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad-looking game the way it is.
187147	189549	You know, it's just that, you know, we want it to look even better.
189569	191149	We want our first experience to be the best.
191970	199334	Well, we did get our PS3, and the first thing Dan did was pop in the Talladega Nights that comes with it.
199830	200871	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
228055	236540	I don't want to say, you know, go back to eating your crayons, but at the same time, it could go, but I still think HD is going to come out above it.
236740	237400	HD DVD.
238361	239401	How did you feel about the games?
239421	240442	Did you get a chance to look at any games?
240462	240902	We got Resistance.
241262	241423	Uh-huh.
241483	242423	How was that?
242543	242983	Oh, my God.
244204	245485	It made me so motion sick.
246885	248826	It's actually a pretty fun game.
249747	256010	I like shooting the zombie alien people in the head and setting fire to the pulsating pods on the ground.
256791	264595	I have to say, the thing that got me the most with that game is looking through a doorway in the distance to see more stuff in the distance.
265556	269518	I have to say, it didn't have much of the...
271175	284968	Much of the, I would say, the graphic issues I saw at E3, so I'm going to sort of, I said I would reserve my final judgment for actually seeing the games, and I have to say, that one at least left a good impression on me.
285959	290003	as it seems to be the popular choice amongst the must-have launch titles resistance.
290183	292545	Did you get a chance to look at any of the other stuff?
292806	293566	Not yet, not yet.
294287	301013	We're still not too excited about a lot of the launch titles, so we're going to hold off until better out.
301334	302054	How's the interface?
303215	307960	I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate the internet thing on it.
308781	310022	Like the registration thing, I'm sorry.
310823	312665	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
330541	333042	So all that other crap I don't really care about.
333062	337984	So you haven't really done any of the other silly stuff like the photos or the music?
338124	339265	I have my Wii.
340325	341546	What do I need the PS3 for?
342586	343647	I have a Wii for all that.
344347	345607	So then you've been playing the Wii?
345888	346068	Yes.
346308	347428	I've actually been playing with Miichannel.
348249	348929	I made the doctor.
351330	353651	Okay, everybody who is on...
354500	358163	My friends list on my Wii is going to get my Mii of the Doctor.
358663	359043	Oh boy.
360444	362165	I need to figure out, I wish I could make a TARDIS.
362605	368129	I notice a lot of people are living out their fanboy and fangirl things through the Mii channel.
368209	373533	Because I'm looking at the parade, and I'm seeing lots of very strange type of Mii's.
373573	374593	Everything from... I have Kojima.
374954	380117	Yeah, I've seen everything from Hideo... I kidnapped Kojima from... I've seen everything from Hideo Kojima to Whoopi Goldberg.
380537	384240	Somebody made a Mii on my friends list from Whoopi Goldberg, and I'm like...
384640	385821	How bored are you people?
387462	389124	Well, I've been enjoying it.
391105	393067	Our neighbors have me's on my Wii.
393407	394148	Me's on my Wii.
395329	402074	But one thing I have to bring up just from my friends list on my live journal is that my mama's son, who lives in Alabama...
405412	411874	She posted the warning thing about the Wii about, you know, make sure you have the strap on or you'll swing it back and hit somebody in the head.
411934	418336	And so another friend of ours suggested that she replace Wii with penis.
419096	420396	So she typed it up that way.
421417	423297	And it actually makes perfectly good sense.
423877	426118	And we got into a big conversation about it this morning over AIM.
426178	426678	It was pretty funny.
428139	429939	So I've been playing a lot of Cooking Mama.
430880	432300	I can make really good curry now.
433157	433958	I could already make curry.
433998	435059	Have you been poking the steak?
435739	436880	Yes, I've been poking the steak.
437180	437380	Good.
437861	443105	I've been slicing the potatoes and grating the... Why is it that the potatoes look like carrots?
443325	444286	Have you been tending the garden?
445467	445847	Garden?
445947	446508	I haven't done that yet.
446528	446828	Never mind.
447869	448750	Whatever, okay?
448770	453093	I still have yet to play my Trauma Center.
453854	457036	Even though I put it in, I was like, oh, I'll play... And then I got distracted.
457677	458758	Trauma Center DS or Wii?
459398	459699	DS.
460039	460119	Oh.
460832	463893	I started playing the Wii and then I realized that Dan took the nunchuck with him to work.
464474	467955	So that means I have to go buy one, which has been stupid because I've been trying to look for one.
468435	469435	And nowhere has him.
470016	470936	And someone said Walmart.
470956	472277	And I'm like, I don't go to Walmart.
473117	475078	Christmas, Walmart.
475438	475858	People.
476378	476958	Stupid people.
477759	480220	So I've been, like, not going there.
481440	482601	And I played something else.
484181	485142	Oh, yeah, we got a new pinball machine.
485162	486322	I don't know if I mentioned this.
486602	488463	In the last few weeks, we got a creature from the Black Lagoon.
489281	491062	I've been playing a lot of Creature from the Black Lagoon.
491882	499806	Inside it has a holographic 3D creature, so it's Creature from the Black Lagoon in 3D, but you can make the creature pop up and get the multiball.
500046	501227	It has a very complex multiball.
502147	503027	We got a Rocky and Bullwinkle.
503808	505409	Dan is still trying to fix our hat trick.
506009	511571	On the back glass, the marquee, it has him pulling the rabbit out of the hat behind the marquee.
512012	513953	So he bought the parts and is trying to fix it.
514353	519015	I did find that the Wayback Machine on the pinball table has a little DeLorean right beside it.
520249	520910	from Back to the Future.
521610	521850	Cute.
522371	523091	Yeah, it was pretty funny.
524072	528455	And so that's been... I've done a lot of gaming, just it's been in concentrated doses.
528495	529576	I need to get back on PSU.
530256	530456	Alright.
530976	531637	Well, good luck with that.
532758	533738	Loki, how was your gaming week?
534859	536400	My week was okay.
536500	537461	I didn't play a whole lot.
537841	539522	I did play some of my Wii games.
539903	542805	More Excite Truck finished almost all that.
542865	546647	Finished the Normal Excite and the Super Excite mode.
546707	548749	Now I'm just getting S's in Super Excite 2.
550066	551987	Unlock the Mirror Tracks and stuff.
552287	554208	Not that I really care at this point.
554648	555849	Play the Burger King games.
556829	557990	All very, very creepy.
560911	562932	Pocket Bike Racer, very glitchy.
563613	565334	Getting stuck in walls and stuff.
565554	567955	Poorly designed tracks, but what do you expect for four bucks?
568435	573057	And then Big Bumpin' is kind of... It could be fun with four players.
573097	575639	We played it at three and it was okay.
575659	578320	We still didn't know what we were supposed to do for some of them, so...
579150	580231	That's the only thing that sucked.
580731	581871	But other than that, it's pretty fun.
582132	585753	And then more Grand Theft Auto, which, you know, it's starting to grow on us a little bit.
586694	588035	Still very, very glitchy.
588115	592357	Cars sticking out of the ground and stuff, crashing into visible objects and whatnot.
594398	598980	Other than that, just, yeah, Rayman's Raving Rabbids a little bit.
600121	601521	Just waiting for new games.
602302	608825	You know, I've heard a lot of really good things on the internet from my friends about Rayman's Raving Rabbids, but I seem to recall you weren't as big on it.
609400	611141	No, I was fine with Ranma.
611201	613623	It's just, you know, you have to unlock everything.
614123	621228	There is one thing, though, that's really broken on it, and that's the, like, bunny hunting, like, first-person shooter parts in it.
622649	630254	When you go to play them in, like, versus mode or, you know, the tournament play or whatever, you can't do four players at once, even though it's an option there.
630374	636498	I had four controllers plugged in, and it says, please plug in, you know, two or more controllers to play multiplayer.
637153	639814	I said, okay, hit A, and it just kicks it back out.
640215	645437	So that's broken on the game, and I'm surprised no one's really noticed this yet.
645998	648099	Are you sure you're not just doing something wrong?
649019	650460	I have four controllers plugged in.
650480	652781	It said plug in two or more controllers.
653062	658084	That's what I did, so... I don't know what they want, but whatever.
658364	663127	And so, you know, just kind of messing with that a little bit, and then...
664386	666327	I really haven't played too much else right now.
666467	669588	I might be selling back some more stuff.
669608	671089	I finished Oblivion.
671129	673050	I can't remember if I mentioned that last time.
675571	676732	Just waiting to get some new games.
679493	686236	You guys are going to laugh at me, but honestly, most of my gaming time has been on the Wii, but on those freaking virtual console games.
687139	697747	Which is so stupid that I bought this $250 console and I can't stop playing games that I could be playing for free on the computer and all this stuff.
697887	698508	I don't know why.
698568	708135	It's just like having that whole thing about having it back on the TV and being able to just kind of have the controller because it's all wireless and most of the virtual console games I've been playing are wireless.
708555	709296	I don't know why.
709476	712038	I'm such a sucker and I admit it.
712878	714740	I want to tease myself, but I can't.
715260	716883	I can't stop playing old school Zelda.
717564	719868	I'm just about done with the first quest on old school Zelda.
720890	721331	It's awesome.
721909	724671	When Mario Kart 64 comes out, it's on.
724891	725532	Oh, I hope so.
725652	726072	I hope so.
727033	728454	What else have I been playing?
729375	730115	Old School Sonic.
730255	733397	I bought Old School Sonic on Genesis, and I've been playing that, too.
733758	740403	And I got further... Usually, I think I never really got past Green Hill Zone, the level that everybody fucking played.
740683	743885	But I've actually been playing more of it, because I never owned a Genesis.
743905	745126	I only ever went to my friend's house.
745146	746907	I'm kind of wondering what they're going to look like on the...
747948	752631	Virtual Console with the component cables, because I remember at E3 they looked really good, like really vivid.
752651	770244	I think it'll be pretty sharp, but... My only bitch is that it wasn't smart enough to letterbox if you're on a widescreen, and I know you can change the settings on the TV, I'm not stupid, but I don't like, like, okay, our remote for the TV got misplaced, so it's a real bitch to change the aspect ratio.
770484	775187	So I kind of wish my Wii was smart enough to change it for me, you know, but it doesn't.
775831	776391	Thanks for watching!
792944	795146	You know, and that unfortunately happens with a lot of retro titles.
795166	797188	You download them, you go, why was I so into this?
797208	798649	Some of the later Bonk titles were good.
798809	801531	Yeah, maybe that's what it is, but the first one was not that great.
801551	805895	There's just no point, though, because honestly, everything that's on Virtual Console right now, I have.
806836	809037	But isn't it nice to just have it all right there?
809858	818145	I didn't have a Turbo FX, I didn't have a Genesis, so... Well, half of the fun for me, and it's the only reason why I'm not as much into emulators either, is because I just like hooking up the system and playing it.
819113	822977	I like having the right controller in my hand.
825599	831244	If something comes up on the virtual console that was really rare that I don't have, like say that they put, oh, Panorama Cotton.
831785	832205	Good luck.
832866	834367	That's what I'm saying.
834527	836088	Then maybe I will download something.
836489	836689	I see.
837922	839023	Well, maybe you can start a petition.
839443	841584	I want them to put Guardian Legend on Virtual Console.
842105	843005	Okay, I would download Guardian Legend.
843025	846928	You know what I don't understand is why it's taking them so long to put these stupid Virtual Console games on there.
847228	852011	I think it's one of those things where they're trying to spread it out to make it look like, hey, new stuff every week.
852051	852551	Kind of like how...
852998	858782	Just like how Microsoft does, you know, they're sitting on a few arcade games and they only release the one a week or whatever.
859622	864665	I imagine they go through the same QA process as most of their other games go through and all that other stuff.
864685	866947	So they probably have certification, all that crap.
867347	870009	So they probably are just testing to make sure the games actually work.
870349	875292	You know, because backwards compatibility issues that you've heard on other systems, you know, maybe they're just making sure.
875312	878674	Maybe if you wait long enough, you know, between games, you'll buy the crappy ones.
879178	879518	I don't know.
879598	885424	Well, my thought, okay, probably when the Metroid game comes out on Wii is when old school Metroid will be available.
885484	887586	And so, you know, they're probably going to do little things like that.
887906	889007	But it is very strange.
889027	889888	Where's Excitebike then?
890188	891229	It is very, yeah, it's true.
891329	894172	It is very strange that Japan's launch is like Uber.
894372	899197	If you look at their virtual console lineup, I mean, they got Castlevania 4 and like a bunch of stuff I would really want.
899217	902380	Like, if they had Castlevania 4 on virtual console, I'd be buying that shit right now.
903201	903561	Totally.
904182	904342	So...
904921	905601	Which I don't understand.
905781	911224	I mean, like, I have GameTap on the PC and you can play the first three Castlevanias there and other stuff.
911504	919387	You know, but I don't know what it is about the TV and the sound system and the... I'd love to curl up on the couch and play.
919407	921348	To be honest, I want the original games.
921608	925410	You know, like, games that they're making specifically for the virtual console.
925570	930492	That's what I would like to see instead of this retro stuff because I really just don't...
931849	934862	I bought Zelda, I bought Super Mario 64, have I played them?
935689	936349	Yeah, like twice.
936609	937050	And that's it.
937210	938310	I'm done with them already.
939051	940131	I do that for some titles.
940151	942872	Like SimCity, I played once or twice and that was it.
942952	944553	I bought like five virtual console games.
944593	949015	I bought SimCity, Mario Brothers, which was... I'm teasing myself.
949075	950716	Rob, you're so stupid for buying Mario Brothers.
950756	959339	It's been on like every single Game Boy Advance version of Mario, but it really is like one of my favorite 80s arcade games they ever put out was the old school Mario Brothers.
959359	961000	I have a lot of memories of that as a kid.
961060	962721	So maybe there's something to be said there.
963061	963961	But I bought those two.
964062	965002	I bought Bonk,
965783	967704	Zelda, and Sonic.
968744	970164	And I still want to get, like, Golden Axe.
970364	975226	And I'm going, Rob, why not just get that stupid Genesis collection on PS2 instead of buying these virtual console games?
975306	975646	I don't know.
975686	976366	I can't stop.
977266	978027	It's an addiction.
978347	978607	Addict.
978947	981208	Maybe I keep hoping they're going to add multiplayer later on.
981268	981628	I don't know.
982728	985669	Well, they said that they're going to be updating the virtual console games.
985749	986589	That's implied.
986649	988130	I don't think anyone at Nintendo said that.
988170	988950	That's implied.
989417	990158	Thanks for watching!
1004680	1007843	Out of Virtual Console games, Trauma Center, Second Opinion on Wii.
1008104	1011307	Now, see, understand I never played the DS one, so this is all new to me.
1011647	1015831	Graphically, the game is not so hot, but the game itself is so great.
1017733	1021937	The operation, everything, the Wii is awesome for a game like that, so I'm having fun with that.
1022678	1024880	And then I've been watching my roommate play Excite Trek.
1024900	1026021	You guys know Extifer, right?
1026061	1028223	He is obsessed with Excite Trek.
1028243	1029024	In fact, he's playing it now.
1030448	1034110	He's gotten all the Excite and Super Excite and everything.
1034311	1036972	He's working on Mirror Mode right now, which I guess is in the game too.
1037413	1038653	He's working on getting Mirror Mode.
1038673	1040635	He's getting S's in Super Excite.
1040935	1042336	Oh my gosh, this is crazy.
1042356	1044397	Every time I come home, there's Excite Truck going.
1044517	1045718	I found a fun peripheral for that.
1045918	1046738	What?
1046778	1049160	They have an actual wheel attachment for the Wiimote.
1049260	1050501	Oh, the GT game.
1050841	1052042	Won't work with Excite Truck.
1052062	1052182	Really?
1052242	1052502	Really?
1052947	1054489	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1062199	1066982	has it, you know, facing the top of the, you know, basically away, the wrong direction.
1067042	1069904	I think you can, I think that'll work in Excite Truck, though.
1070124	1073546	I think, because I seem to remember E3, that's how I was playing it.
1073586	1077328	I have to go back and find that video or picture of me playing E3, but at E3, that's how I was playing it.
1077348	1084553	Because I thought that's how you were supposed to hold it, was out, like where the, not where the controller was lying flat, but where the controller was facing you, and I think it still worked.
1084893	1085914	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1102418	1103919	I just can't imagine this as a steering wheel.
1103939	1105921	I just need something to do the imagining for me.
1131802	1137003	As far as other games I've been playing, back over to the 360, I have been playing a little bit of Phantasy Star Universe.
1137023	1138444	I had to check out the new stuff when they added it.
1139064	1141584	And Burger King games, I actually checked out as well.
1142785	1150326	You know, they're all stupid, but considering the fact that they cost, you know, kind of less than an arcade game, I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't.
1150366	1153707	I mean, you have to buy the value meal, so the games aren't really four bucks.
1153747	1156488	The games are like eight bucks with food, you know, type thing.
1156848	1161109	So, but whatever, it's still a pretty decent value, all things considered.
1161699	1166583	and, you know, the games, you know, I think Sneak King was my favorite, as I imagine most people.
1166603	1168065	All very creepy, though.
1168285	1170547	And Pocket Bite Racer, not so much.
1171047	1171908	Wasn't feeling that one.
1171948	1173069	Big Bumpin' is somewhere in the middle.
1173109	1177412	Big Bumpin' is pretty easy to pick up and go, but... I hear it's great on live.
1177853	1178553	I bet, yeah.
1178714	1181396	I might have to check that out on live while I'm stealing your copies of those.
1181996	1184238	and try to get some of those achievements and what have you.
1185058	1186919	Super easy achievements for some of them.
1186959	1187199	Really?
1187880	1190381	Well, you got one for getting stuck on a wall.
1190601	1198606	I played like two courses on that Pocket Buy Racer before I kind of got fed up with it and I already had gotten like 30 points in achievements for doing nothing.
1199487	1200327	So it was interesting.
1201068	1203589	I'm not the achievement point whore you are though, Loki.
1205110	1205651	Maybe a little bit.
1207062	1207842	Let's see, what else?
1208823	1211323	Lastly, I would say I've been playing Viva Pinata.
1211523	1213084	I picked up last night.
1214644	1215384	It's interesting.
1215985	1217225	It's not what I thought it would be.
1217245	1220906	I mean, they told me it's kind of like The Sims and stuff, but I don't know.
1220926	1222307	I had something else pictured in my mind.
1223567	1226368	There's a lot that goes on in that game at once.
1226548	1232710	I don't know if it's just because I've been moving pretty fast, but if I was a kid, I'd be so lost in that game right now, I wouldn't be able to keep up with it.
1233150	1233970	But it seems like
1234400	1234900	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1253553	1255054	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1278487	1281108	and she casts a little spell and she takes away your shovel.
1281308	1282388	And you're kind of screwed.
1282408	1285909	You have to have a shovel in that game to clear places for the house to go.
1286029	1287830	So I had to reset completely.
1288370	1289911	And Matt was just laughing the whole time.
1291371	1292892	Because it's fun to hit things with shovels.
1294572	1295492	Actually, I hope you don't mind.
1295512	1296613	There's one other thing I forgot.
1296973	1297273	What's that?
1297293	1297913	Dan's playing.
1298373	1299554	Okay, I'm done pretty much.
1299574	1300574	Bookworm Adventure.
1301144	1302144	Bookworm Adventure.
1302905	1305065	I read stories on the internet about Bookworm Adventure.
1305085	1307426	It's not one of those casual games like PopCap type games.
1307446	1308206	It's for kids.
1309107	1311848	But it's funny because Dan's like, this is actually getting challenging.
1312788	1325252	Maybe kids and my co-workers because tons of people at work, I walk around and I see them playing whether it be Bejeweled or Zuma or what's that other one?
1325512	1326813	I've been playing Bejeweled on my cell phone.
1327053	1327533	Collapse.
1328308	1338313	Well, it's funny, I was putting on my shoes to come over this morning, I was looking at, watching Dan play the game, and it sort of makes me think of sort of like Scrabble, almost, how you form your words out of the letters you're given.
1338913	1343996	But Dan's like, I have the XY sword, so if I use a word with an X or a Y, I do triple damage.
1344416	1345396	I'm like, okay.
1346117	1348098	Oh, he needs to get Xylophone, because then he'd have both.
1348318	1349798	I don't think there'd be enough letters pulled up for Xylophone.
1349818	1350139	Whatever.
1350299	1356862	But the longer the letter, the longer the word you spell out of the letters you're given, the more damage you do, and he'd like beat up a lion, and it had blood and everything.
1356882	1356962	Yeah.
1357839	1358159	Interesting.
1358179	1359100	Where can you check that out?
1359140	1359400	Do you know?
1359680	1362522	I actually do not, but I will find out for our listeners next week.
1362622	1363423	Sounds good.
1364244	1364544	All right.
1364884	1366065	A little bit of housekeeping.
1366825	1368587	This week will only be a one-part show.
1368687	1380355	I know you guys are probably really ticked off because we weren't even here last week, but I'm out of town tomorrow night on our usual live time, and because of that, DarkSakura made other plans, and I'm sure Loki's going to
1380865	1381605	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1410785	1414177	We have some website changes coming up, just some little minor things.
1414539	1416586	We've put some live show status...
1417631	1418472	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1445014	1445294	DarkSakura.com
1462663	1462723	D.M.N.
1462803	1463103	and DJ Tyrant
1491923	1494244	as well as Travis Donovan live is alive and kicking.
1494264	1499285	If you're into sci-fi, Travis, Saturday nights at 7, good times, good times.
1500865	1509888	Also, there's other things being worked on for next year, so keep an ear, I guess, to your computer speaker or whatever you listen to us through.
1510188	1510668	Absolutely.
1510968	1515309	And if you have an idea for a show, if you think you can do better, well, let's hear it.
1515570	1519131	Send us an email, and we're open to new suggestions for new shows always.
1519311	1520731	That's how DMN and DJ Tyron did it.
1520950	1522151	We're open to new experiences.
1549268	1551109	He is now the man in charge.
1551530	1555774	Kaz Hirai is heading over to Tokyo to do the world group.
1556694	1569606	And the co-CEO of Sony America, Jack Trenton, is going to take Kaz Hirai's place and is actually going to be the first American to hold that position in the company.
1570186	1571107	So that's actually pretty cool.
1571688	1571988	But I...
1574454	1582843	I've seen speculation since I first found the information and actually I want to thank our buddy Robway for sending me some of the first information on it too.
1585426	1589531	I think the whole reason they're doing that is you done screwed this up.
1589811	1592414	You go sit in the office and eat some crayons there.
1593228	1599670	I think that he's got a broader vision, I think.
1599930	1601070	Or maybe that's what they're thinking.
1601090	1603991	Well, it's weird because I've seen this story approached in two ways.
1604091	1609552	I've seen it approached as, oh, this is a downgrade for him.
1609632	1615233	Even though he's moving to a CEO position, he's being moved because the Sony PlayStation 3 launch has been botched.
1615513	1617314	The PSP's not doing as well as it should have.
1617494	1619694	But I've also seen it reported as, this is a promotion.
1619734	1620855	He's going to be a CEO.
1620935	1622235	That's a big title.
1623295	1624455	It depends.
1625556	1628277	How much of a Sony fanboy or Kutaragi fanboy are you?
1628517	1630217	That's how you're going to interpret this, I suppose.
1630357	1639500	Now, I'm going to take this from being that you've been in the same... We've all been working for various corporations over our off-radio career.
1640480	1648403	But looking at this from a very upper management point of view, I think that they see he's this public figure.
1649068	1650310	and DarkSakura.com.
1664375	1665356	I kind of agree.
1665416	1668277	I think when something's broken, you fix it.
1668357	1674120	And I think there is that perception that PlayStation 3 and PSP could be doing... I mean, well, it's hard to say.
1674400	1680143	PlayStation 3, obviously, it's selling out on shelves, yes, but not nearly as many as there should have been.
1680363	1687067	And certainly it's made its way into pop culture, but I think Sony had hoped to push more out by the end of the year than they're realistically going to.
1687127	1689168	And all this eBay profiteering stuff, whatever.
1689488	1690669	But since he...
1691529	1693270	has done a lot of good for the company previously.
1693290	1697472	I think they're just doing this shuffle to just try something and put some new ideas in there.
1697552	1700333	So I think it's just them trying a different approach.
1700433	1702414	I don't necessarily think it's good or bad.
1702454	1703154	It's just different.
1703194	1704314	They want to go somewhere different.
1704454	1707255	I've seen similar things happen with the company that I work for.
1707276	1718580	I've seen people who I just thought were a total botch on their management jobs go into VP positions and just soar.
1719040	1720721	Because it has to do... I think...
1721625	1724186	As far as anything business related, everyone's going to have their talents.
1724206	1725466	Everyone's going to have their strong points here and there.
1725506	1730288	And where I still think that Kutaragi is probably a big old stupid, stupid, no common sense person.
1731529	1732749	He's there for a reason.
1732889	1735090	He's made it as far as he has for a reason.
1735770	1737991	And I think that... PlayStation 2 did kick ass.
1738631	1745954	And I think that they're trying to save an asset that has proved beneficial to them in the past.
1746634	1746854	All right.
1747874	1749795	Loki, any thoughts on the whole corporate reshuffle?
1750692	1751072	I don't know.
1751653	1760119	Hopefully, if putting him in a position that he has more authority, I guess, will cause him to shut up more.
1760480	1768006	It would be most beneficial in Sony's eyes.
1770347	1771408	He just needs to shut up.
1771528	1773350	If he's good at running the company, great.
1774270	1778754	Run the company, but just stop having him spout off stupid stuff because he's just
1779434	1786539	Well, I think a lot of Sony management in general has been accused of being cocky and all that other crap, you know, through this whole thing.
1786899	1794745	So I don't see this as one guy's problem because, you know, the guy in Europe wouldn't shut his mouth either and all this other stuff, you know.
1796426	1797847	Well, here's what it is to me.
1798287	1805452	It seems like, you know, the higher up you get, I mean, granted, in the beginning you brought the company to where it needs to be, you know, you.
1806797	1808038	You pretty much know your job.
1808058	1808758	You know how to do it.
1808818	1813781	But once you get so high up, your hand's off on a lot of it.
1813961	1819945	And so you kind of lose face where how stuff actually happens.
1820165	1823227	And pretty soon you become out of touch with how that company is actually running.
1823487	1825188	And so you start spouting off crazy shit.
1825528	1827949	And it's actually not realistic.
1827969	1829390	All right.
1829650	1834473	Well, moving on to something I thought was kind of interesting that kind of happened because of this.
1834935	1835876	I cannot now imagine a PlayStation 4.
1863935	1865015	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1881761	1885343	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1903055	1905336	I'm thinking people are running way too far with this quote.
1905416	1909057	It's way too early to tell if Sony is going to ditch a PlayStation 4.
1909397	1909997	Come on.
1910317	1911257	Sony replied to that, though.
1911437	1913138	PlayStation 3 is still a baby.
1913178	1913718	What did they say?
1914438	1917059	To go ahead and quote, it was actually their U.S.
1917079	1918639	spokesperson, Dave Caracker.
1918699	1921440	This is on GameSpot, but I got my information from Eurogamer.
1922600	1932263	To quote, following the launch of PlayStation 3 just a few weeks ago and witnessing the huge consumer demand for the product, I think it would be rather short-sighted for anyone to predict there might not be a next generation of PlayStation product.
1933015	1933556	eBay Profiteering
1944605	1949046	because they know that it's not based on Sony's product being uber great.
1949166	1952466	It's because, oh, look, I made lots of money on the 360 last year.
1952526	1958287	Look, there's a similar situation where there's not going to be enough consoles and people want them, so we're going to sell them for a lot of money.
1958407	1961268	People are spending a buttload of money on those PlayStation 3s, though.
1961308	1962408	That's the demand they're talking about.
1962428	1964688	Because little Billy whines and wants, I want my PlayStation 3!
1965449	1968049	And then little Billy's parents will buy it.
1968069	1969589	Little Billy should go do the dishes.
1969929	1973190	Well, Hirai also was bringing up the PS4 himself.
1973871	1976192	You know, talking about future plans.
1976952	1982594	And there was also discussion about them going into electronic distribution for games in the future.
1982874	1987736	I'm sorry, but they should not even be talking PlayStation 4 right now, you know?
1988076	1990237	Make the PlayStation 3 work first.
1990317	1994479	Focus on, you know, maybe they do need to put a guy on the software side there.
1994779	1996880	Put out some better software for PlayStation 3.
1997180	1999220	What's the number one complaint been about this launch?
1999521	2002682	Their launch titles blow, except for maybe Resistance.
2002782	2003162	However...
2004777	2006278	And I'm trying to see it from their point of view too.
2006919	2013464	If they don't start thinking about the next generation of system now, everybody else is going to be ahead of them.
2013524	2015346	Thinking about it and talking about it are two different things.
2015506	2020531	Yeah, but granted though, this console is supposed to have a ten year life cycle whereas the other ones are only five years.
2020911	2022913	So why are they concerned about the console now?
2023193	2025155	Are they going back on their word again?
2025715	2027337	I mean, woo, that'd be a shocker.
2027797	2030980	No, but really, you know,
2031670	2037880	If you're going to believe that there's going to be no PlayStation 4 when Microsoft announces the next Xbox, they're definitely going to announce the next PlayStation.
2037920	2038340	Bingo.
2039182	2045832	I think that it actually... I think, yeah, the focus should be on the current system now that it's out, but I think that it's still good.
2046516	2050702	Because as long as you've got the money to pay for the team of specialists, then do it.
2050922	2056030	You have your little team of specialists that are working away on it, but they're in a closed room that we don't talk about.
2056070	2063060	Because for me, if they were to come out and say, oh, we've already got this PlayStation 4 thing in the works, to me that's them saying,
2063716	2064977	The PlayStation 3 is fucked.
2065898	2069200	I'm just going to say, well, I guess I ain't going to get one because they're already working on 4.
2069480	2070360	Remember the Gizmondo?
2070801	2077465	Oh, yeah, by the way, even though our Gizmondo hasn't launched yet, we've got the widescreen version in the works.
2078546	2081788	It'd be like announcing the DS Lite when the DS comes out.
2082368	2085430	My question is, how come Nintendo gets away with this shit?
2085570	2088492	Because they just announced the Wii DVD thing.
2090264	2113701	It's gonna be more expensive and who gives a shit It's like saying, oh look, it plays CDs now Oh goody, let me go run out and get another CD player Oh wait, no, I don't need one because I have 60,000 of them We also know Wii's are gonna come out in different colors at some point based on what we saw at E3 You get them in different colors now They have sites that, you know, will do custom paint jobs That's different, I'm talking about officially licensed Nintendo pink Wii's Oh, big deal You want a pink Wii?
2113761	2114021	Yes
2115424	2116405	Are you going to play with it?
2116765	2117565	Is that so wrong?
2117905	2119346	Yes, that's actually very wrong.
2121267	2122447	I just think it's interesting.
2122748	2124248	Even better if you get a blue Wii.
2125169	2126009	It's just interesting.
2126449	2132873	Nintendo gets away with things sometimes that people are critical of other companies about, and it's fascinating to me.
2133213	2135494	And even I'm guilty of it too.
2136491	2138432	But because they're Nintendo, we let them get away with it.
2138552	2138973	I don't know.
2140113	2141114	Well, it comes down to games.
2141134	2141774	It comes down to games.
2141874	2144716	But, you know, Sony's always going back on their word and stuff.
2144776	2150299	And even now, they're still insisting that they're going to ship one million PlayStation 3 consoles by the end of this year.
2151040	2152441	Well, you know what?
2152581	2153361	I don't think so.
2153541	2159325	I mean, even Electronic Arts, Larry Probst, was basically telling Reuters that
2160451	2171095	They only shipped out about 200,000 units, if that, on the initial launch for the United States, even though they were saying, oh yeah, we're going to have half a million units or 600,000 units.
2171535	2180878	Yeah, they didn't really meet those numbers, and kind of speculating on that, they're probably only going to hit about half a million to 800,000 by the end of the year.
2181438	2182198	Makes sense to me.
2182258	2187920	I mean, they've already underestimated or overestimated the amount of units that are going to be out there, and
2188789	2190771	I just don't think they can produce them fast enough.
2191091	2199379	Especially if they start running into problems like Microsoft had with units overheating or some sort of hardware glitch.
2200240	2201681	A.K.A.
2201761	2204542	be very careful about the first batch of any new console.
2204763	2210986	Well, given the rent of first batch PlayStation 2s, the just massive amounts of problems that they had.
2211386	2219470	Well, on top of that, I think one of the big problems with the PS2 is that it was not really meant to be used as a primary DVD player, which a lot of people were getting it for.
2221151	2224193	And the systems would burn out, the first models.
2224253	2226834	I'm actually still surprised that my first model Japanese one still works.
2227475	2227595	Well...
2228789	2236255	Yeah, I mean, what's also good, though, is Nintendo is still saying that they're ahead of schedule and they're going to be shipping out, you know, the units that they promised.
2236375	2237796	So that's good.
2237816	2243441	At least those launches, I know, in Japan certainly weren't delayed and they had enough units out there.
2243581	2251367	So, you know, I think what it comes down to is UK, you know, patiently waiting and saying, okay, are we actually going to get our launch in March?
2251547	2255230	I mean, and when we do have a launch, exactly how many units is a launch?
2255310	2257152	I mean, here's your one unit.
2257772	2258273	Please share.
2260003	2261043	I don't know.
2261083	2266065	We have a lot of folks over in the UK who listen to us, and of course we're thankful for that and appreciate that you guys listen to us.
2266525	2269266	I can't help but think you guys really aren't missing that much.
2269567	2270627	You're really not.
2271447	2272068	I understand.
2272128	2277570	Maybe you want the cheap Blu-ray player or whatever it is, but I don't have one either right now.
2277610	2278730	I don't even really want one.
2280711	2282391	Does a European listener maybe want to send me money?
2282751	2283992	I'll buy you one here and send you one.
2284032	2285352	No, you can't even get them here.
2285432	2287373	You can't ship them either.
2287393	2289434	Yeah, because of the lockdown.
2289796	2290317	Oh, jeez.
2291057	2291597	Enclosed.
2291698	2292338	Form and grill.
2292658	2293599	Jeez, jeez, jeez.
2293639	2294820	Put it in a form and grill box.
2295020	2300204	What you need to do is you need to ship it to another country, and in that country, someone there has to, you know, pretty much walk across.
2300284	2301605	It's not worth it.
2301865	2302306	It's not.
2302886	2304807	Is Resistance that good, Jamie?
2305288	2306909	Is Resistance that good?
2308510	2308750	No.
2309171	2310011	Then there you go.
2310131	2311252	It's not worth it.
2311532	2312693	Just buy Call of Duty 3 and the 360.
2313014	2314054	It's about the same.
2315576	2317277	Resistance is a pretty...
2318519	2324503	And I do like shooting things in the head, but I can shoot things in the head in other games, like Resident Evil 4.
2325224	2326044	Shoot him in the head!
2328666	2328986	Alright.
2330947	2331708	This ain't a cutscene.
2331728	2336911	Press A. If I press A, it'll type over our show thing.
2337171	2337512	Anyway.
2338152	2346978	So, remember how all the fun that we were talking about Gran Turismo HD, and how it was just a big, you know, blown-up HD version of Gran Turismo 4?
2349286	2352971	How the game was going to cost $700 after you bought all the cars?
2353552	2357557	Well, it's actually going to be a free demo now at the PlayStation Store.
2358340	2363702	It'll be out, so far only for Japan, be out on the 24th of December.
2364342	2365902	Gran Turismo HD Concept.
2366162	2374905	It will have 10 cars, 2 layouts of a single track, at least according to what Yamauchi said, the designer.
2375565	2384447	It has Time Attack, Drift Trial, Network Ranking, and they're also putting more focus on GT5 when it's out.
2387932	2389132	which is actually slated for 2008.
2389472	2391053	Not bad for free, though.
2391733	2397214	I guess that's not... That's a nice price reduction from, you know, $900 or whatever we were joking about to free.
2397714	2400215	So, yay for Sony.
2400375	2400835	Good job.
2400855	2407997	I think someone finally stepped in and, you know, like an analyst or something, one of the guys that they have working for the company, they go, you actually think this is going to work?
2408097	2409717	Because this is not going to work.
2409898	2411918	The internet hates you right now.
2412098	2413939	Maybe you need to try something different.
2414939	2415659	Yeah, um,
2417248	2418329	But here's the thing, though.
2419690	2435238	We're not certain, though, what Gran Turismo 5 is going to be, and they could very well do something like this, kind of meeting in the middle ground and having a decent amount of cars, say like, I don't know, 60 or something, and you still have to buy 500 other cars online.
2435298	2440842	So we don't know about that yet, but when you're advertising the game as a tech demo on E3...
2442302	2443443	Oh, by the way, it's not a tech demo.
2443463	2445423	That's a full game, and we want you to buy it for $50.
2445864	2447864	Oh, by the way, it doesn't come with any cars.
2449365	2449825	I'm sorry.
2450525	2454467	That's their same logic as saying, oh, you'd buy a Sony PlayStation 3 if there weren't any games.
2454507	2456308	I think PR just kind of botched the project.
2457468	2460249	I agree with the concept that, you know what, just make Gran Turismo 5.
2460429	2460910	Shut up and make 5.
2463190	2463431	All right.
2463791	2467052	Anyway, we don't know if that will be coming to the U.S.
2467112	2467572	yet, do we?
2468072	2470633	It's just in Japan only right now, but I would suspect so.
2471034	2471594	Yeah, make 5.
2472597	2473598	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2500957	2507220	And so a lot of, it'll be interesting to see how the game does and how many systems are sold in the next week.
2507800	2511062	It'll be kind of interesting to see what effect that has on Japan.
2511722	2514223	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, not a lot.
2514243	2518105	You don't really get any more games until you get Armored Core 4 on the 14th.
2518445	2521186	Same thing with the Wii, since you guys just had your system launch this week.
2521646	2530270	You're not going to get a whole lot of new titles until, again, December 14th when you get Pokemon Battle Revolution and the Japanese version of Rayman Raving Rabbids.
2531036	2534098	But if you're a PS2 fan still, you got a lot of games coming out.
2534478	2550667	You got Devil Summoner is coming out, Ace Combat Zero, both on the 7th, Suikoden V, Genso Suikoden V, as well as Momotaru Densetsu 16 from Hudson, and Taiko no Tatsujin for our music game fans, that's coming out.
2551167	2559032	Taiko no Tatsujin Bang Tap, Tomori 7 Daimei, both a drum controller version and the standalone version coming out, and
2559445	2564692	if you're a Tomb Raider fan in Japan, Tomb Raider Legend on the PlayStation 2 on December 7th as well
2565654	2571319	If you are a Nintendo DS person, there's quite a few games also coming out over there on December 7th.
2572219	2581986	Several games from MediaWorks called DS Dendecki Bunko, which I'm guessing might be a translation of the Dice game.
2582006	2583167	I have no idea.
2583828	2590713	Also, DS Puzzler, coming from TDK Media Active, and Cinema Roll.
2592074	2593555	Ohana Senshohyo, yeah.
2594176	2595336	Coming from Bandai.
2595376	2596116	Is it the same one?
2596357	2596977	Oh, it sure is.
2597117	2597337	Yeah.
2597617	2599277	So check out that one.
2599617	2605239	I don't have any silly title games this week, but I like Cinema Roll, so maybe that'll be my must-checkout title of the week.
2605499	2611300	Hey, if you're a PSP fan, Mahjong and Parappa the Rapper this week, December 7th.
2611340	2611940	Hell yeah.
2612100	2612620	That's right.
2612860	2613360	Check that out.
2613580	2614761	You gotta believe.
2615301	2618081	We have two Cinema Roll, was it Pillows?
2618101	2619502	Remember the... Oh, yeah.
2619542	2620802	Went to the Sanrio outlet.
2622005	2623066	I need more Batsamaru stuff.
2623086	2625728	I want the Batsamaru guitar so bad.
2626588	2627009	So bad.
2627049	2627529	Alright, anyway.
2627549	2631031	Whatever.
2631231	2632292	We don't want to turn into Sanrio chat.
2632332	2634153	I think the Batsamaru one is a bass though.
2635534	2636535	Anyways.
2637015	2639797	Sorry guys, I was busy playing Hello Kitty World.
2643239	2643619	Anyways.
2644140	2648362	So to start off, of course, our release dates, we've got some stuff that you might not have heard about yet.
2649043	2649183	Um...
2649721	2659805	Mario Party 8 for the Wii, coming out March 6th Wario Master of Disguise for the DS, also coming out on the 6th of March Wii Plays coming to the United States on the 21st of January, including the bundle with the remote
2679720	2681141	Actually, it is only bundled with a remote.
2681742	2683283	There's going to be some stuff coming out.
2685284	2687505	Actually, a new Spyro game is in the works right now.
2687705	2690087	Still a working title, Spyro 2007.
2690587	2691688	Obviously, it's not going to be Spyro 2007.
2692408	2693769	Spyro Ultimate!
2694190	2697532	It's coming out on August 15th of next year.
2697852	2701494	It's going to be on PlayStation 2, the Wii, DS, Game Boy Advance, and PSP.
2702495	2704136	This one, I hope, is a working title.
2704216	2705477	Crash Jack in 07.
2705657	2705737	Uh...
2707836	2709837	Mommy, for my birthday, I want Crash Jacket on the Wii.
2709917	2711639	Which is also the same day.
2711659	2712299	It's very strange.
2735984	2739887	Of course, this next week we've got some good stuff coming out.
2740347	2742148	For the Wii, we have Ice Age 2.
2742348	2745750	Well, I said good stuff, so that's not exactly counted in there.
2746371	2754216	But we do have Far Cry Instinct's Vengeance, I believe, is coming out on the Wii as well.
2754256	2755677	That one actually, I heard, is pretty good.
2755697	2757118	It has a good control system in that.
2757178	2761000	So, if you were jaded by Red Steel, you might want to pick that one up instead.
2762061	2764262	And then, of course, on the 360, we've got...
2766301	2771343	Star Trek Legacy, which is going to be pretty good, and Rapala Trophies, which is not going to be very good at all.
2771923	2779225	And on PlayStation 2, one of the only games coming out on PlayStation 2 for December, Rayman's Raving Rabbids, finally.
2779825	2781865	So if you don't have a Wii, that's definitely one to pick up.
2782586	2784726	On PSP, though, you've got some good stuff.
2785266	2794169	Of course, you've got Brothers in Arms, D-Day, and also on the PlayStation 3, Full Auto 2, which is basically Full Auto 1 with Deathmatch.
2795022	2799845	and Fight Night Round 3, which is basically Fight Night Round 3 with first-person mode.
2800925	2803326	I'm kind of curious about the Star Trek game.
2803366	2804647	I liked what I saw at E3.
2805047	2808849	I'm not usually a tactical games type person, but I am a little bit of a Trekkie.
2809449	2811551	I liked the whole Borg ship.
2811731	2814232	Well, I liked how they reenacted the Arathacon thing.
2814252	2815613	That was fabulous.
2815653	2817614	So I'm tempted to check it out.
2817834	2823517	The PSP also is getting Star Wars Lethal Alliance, which is that kind of original game for PSP, so.
2825234	2828578	A little bit of, it's kind of a smorgasbord of stuff to lead from November.
2830280	2836928	Well, in UK gaming news, actually a bunch of games already came out, but we weren't
2837530	2839492	Live to cover it, so I'll just go quickly over that list.
2839893	2850222	Sonic Rivals came out, a couple Football Manager games, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, Viva Pinata, Yoshi's Island, today being the second, actually.
2850743	2853025	Tokobot Plus, Mysteries of the Karakuri came out.
2853786	2856328	Coming out on the 8th, though, we have Wii Launch!
2857609	2858690	So, get your Wii.
2858911	2861173	Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, and then give me your friend code.
2861793	2861893	So...
2863078	2872625	So coming out, we have Barnyard, you have Brothers in Arms, D-Day, Call of Duty 3, Cars, Dead or Alive Extreme 2, get that as well.
2872725	2878350	EA Replay, Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter, with more, you know, acronyms.
2880852	2883554	Hey, if you guys in the UK are camping out for a wee...
2884441	2885262	Thank you for watching!
2908570	2909311	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2931349	2946976	GT Pro Series Madden 2007 Monster 4x4 World Circuit Need for Speed Carbon Open Season Rampage Total Destruction Rayman Raving Rabbids Red Steel Star Trek Legacy
2948168	2977030	Star Trek Legacy Star Wars Lethal Alliance Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz Superman Returns the Video Game Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam Wii Play, Wii Sports and other notables later on this month is Far Cry Vengeance Sims 2 Pets which is actually kind of fun because your pets are on crack
2977739	2981321	and actually Marvel Ultimate Alliance already came out too on I think PS2.
2981421	2984764	On PSP, I'm sorry.
2985944	2986965	And that's really it.
2987085	2996931	And also, just to go ahead and make a mention, I am going to try to be focusing at least once a month on some of the other countries that have different release dates.
2996991	3003996	So if there's any place in particular that you've found as a reliable source for release dates internationally, let me know.
3004056	3005557	Send me an email, jamie.orangerousradio.com.
3006496	3008998	The Better Business Bureau is challenging Toys R Us based on what happened at the Wii launch.
3027540	3028301	www.DarkSakura.com
3049861	3056645	and this one lady was mad and was arguing with the manager about it and we sold out while they were arguing about it.
3056925	3057885	She was pissed.
3058145	3064549	She did one of those consumer call the news things and now the Better Business Bureau is investigating it and I say good.
3065069	3065470	I agree.
3065910	3072496	I think companies need to be aware that we're not going to tolerate that bullshit bundling stuff.
3072676	3075218	I don't want your stupid warranty.
3075618	3076639	If somebody does, great.
3076659	3077540	They can purchase that.
3077580	3079902	You can offer it to me and I can say no, but don't force me to buy it.
3080202	3080783	That's messed up.
3080863	3083185	And the games and all that crap,
3083993	3085334	You know, I say good.
3085575	3098046	And this isn't necessarily something against Toys R Us, because in my mind, reading this story, this sounds like one manager's or district manager's very piss-poor decision that's going to screw the company as a whole, thanks to that.
3098407	3106594	So I will take great satisfaction in knowing that thanks to this, that manager or district manager will probably be canned because of this.
3106895	3107015	And...
3108248	3113151	You know, I hope it will be a lesson for other managers and district managers nationwide.
3113211	3117113	Don't try to use these big console launches.
3117173	3123978	Not that there's going to be another one for quite some time, but in the future, don't use these big console launches and the consumer demand for them to sell your crap.
3124618	3125699	Force us to buy your crap.
3126399	3129141	So, any other thoughts on that, Loki?
3129401	3133323	I understand why they did it, but, you know, the bait and switch part's not good.
3133623	3135745	The bundling's okay, bait and switch's not good.
3135765	3137526	Do you think it's okay to force people to buy those bundles?
3137886	3138006	Yeah.
3138622	3141404	I think it's perfectly fine to do that.
3161348	3164212	And if they have a good experience with about the system, they'll buy their games there.
3164332	3165753	It's about the return business.
3166014	3166574	You know what I mean?
3166615	3175606	If they're going to buy a PlayStation 3 for $2,000 on eBay, what the hell is going to stop me from selling a PlayStation 3 in a retail store with three games attached to it?
3176226	3177348	You're going to buy it, so...
3177762	3178283	No, I'm not.
3195183	3195903	That's human nature.
3195923	3199744	That's the biggest part of it, is you tell me I have to, and I'm like, no, I don't have to do shit.
3199844	3200644	I don't have to do shit.
3200664	3201304	I'm gonna.
3201324	3203005	Who the hell are you to tell me what I have to do?
3203205	3210486	Well, the way Target did it, which I was actually very, very, very pleased with this, is they gave you an incentive.
3210586	3212327	It wasn't like much of an incentive.
3212347	3215447	You get a flashy thing that gives you... Hey, I still have mine.
3215527	3216107	It's pretty.
3216447	3216928	It is pretty.
3216968	3217268	Look at that.
3217568	3218208	It glows blue.
3218988	3219808	I can go get one right now.
3220168	3223329	Miklatov bought 15 of these with a dollar each.
3224404	3225125	On the card.
3225165	3226786	These little gift cards that glow blue.
3226886	3228587	I hope you international folks get something similar.
3228607	3231449	I don't know if they even have Target internationally, but they're so pretty.
3232330	3234492	I was going to get one just to have one, you know?
3234552	3234812	You know what?
3234832	3238014	If they don't do this internationally, maybe I'll send this one to one of our international listeners.
3238034	3238415	They're pretty.
3238635	3239315	They're very pretty.
3239355	3240076	Yeah.
3240136	3246340	It's awfully cool that they glow blue there, even though the console doesn't seem to.
3247081	3247321	Yes, it does.
3247341	3248022	When do you get new mail?
3249203	3250183	Only when I get new mail.
3250203	3250944	Only when it runs updates.
3252349	3253590	Do you want me to send you mail, Loki?
3253970	3258212	No, I can get mail myself, but I'm just saying I want to glow blue all the time.
3260114	3262055	It can pulse blue when I have mail.
3262175	3262675	You're picky.
3263456	3270079	Well, at any rate, I think that we should pick up a couple of them and send some to our overseas listeners if they don't get them.
3270420	3272541	Yeah, I don't know if Target's overseas or what.
3272601	3275082	Send some emails if you really want it.
3275503	3276103	We'll see what we can do.
3276443	3276643	Yeah.
3277484	3277804	All right.
3279131	3282994	With the launches, of course, there's still a lot to desire, especially from the Wii.
3283554	3285995	Lots of things that we wish they would have done that they didn't do.
3286616	3289558	For example, and this is actually... Wait, whose list is this?
3289578	3290438	Because this ain't my list.
3290458	3291839	This is Game Informer's list.
3292259	3294801	But I do agree with a lot of it, and a lot of it I do agree with.
3294821	3298683	Like, for example, accessories component and S-video cables.
3299504	3300084	Where are they?
3300144	3306148	They certainly are sold out and can't seem to find anywhere, so that kind of sucks.
3306228	3307829	More virtual console downloads.
3310036	3317239	A wireless sensor bar, especially if you have a projection TV.
3317839	3328722	The ability to save GameCube saves to the flash memory cards or SD cards might be good, especially if you're renting games or never had GameCube stuff.
3330722	3332403	Better straps for the wireless...
3333604	3340126	Weemotes, now, I think that's just stupid people letting the controllers go, so whatever, but I guess they could be stronger.
3340986	3345488	More user-friendly friends lists, and that's, I could definitely agree with that.
3346208	3350709	A wireless classic controller, so it doesn't have to be tethered to the remote there.
3352650	3358592	And of course, you know, redesign the WaveBird, which I don't really understand that part of it, but okay.
3358902	3359462	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3380126	3386729	I've actually been able to use Picture Channel because my phone saves to the micro SDs and I have a converter so I put the SD card in there and that's why I sent some pictures.
3387049	3389090	Didn't I send you and Nellie like a picture that I doctored?
3389170	3389851	Yeah.
3390071	3392852	A picture I took of a stripper and I drew like a fart cloud coming out.
3392872	3395453	It was really immature but it was funny when I sent it.
3395493	3401216	But actually I heard that it'll grab stuff off of Bluetooth so if your phone's Bluetooth it'll grab it off there.
3401236	3402196	The Bluetooth on my phone's weird.
3402596	3402876	Okay.
3403397	3403657	Anyways.
3404657	3407399	Points leftovers because the Wii points you have to buy them in $10 increments.
3408735	3409175	ProLogic2 ProLogic2
3437641	3440803	Wireless Nunchuck More Control Over The Blue Slot and Illumination Rechargeable Battery Packs
3460908	3462088	I agree with the achievement thing.
3462148	3464850	I can't believe no one copied Microsoft on that whole thing.
3464910	3465650	I think it's cute.
3466130	3467390	I wish they would have done something like that.
3469331	3470011	What was I going to say?
3470051	3472973	The battery packs, I think, are coming.
3473333	3479035	Because if you look inside of it, there's actually a contact where they could have a battery pack for it.
3479375	3481176	So that might be something that's on its way.
3482616	3484537	Better speakers in the Wiimote because they suck.
3484577	3488138	And I'm actually thinking about taking one apart to replace a speaker in it.
3488438	3488878	You're weird.
3488898	3490179	We may see that on a future show.
3491041	3493182	Save games in the Wiimote, which might be cool.
3493582	3495263	More customization for the Wii menu.
3495683	3499225	Game Boy Player, timed demos for every virtual console game.
3499385	3502367	Because a lot of these games I haven't played, so I don't know if they're crap.
3502427	3508690	Okay, this is turning into just a complete, you know, like every little thing that they can think of, you know, they're putting on here that...
3509286	3511328	You know, I don't know.
3511348	3513489	Probably not as if they haven't already thought of it themselves.
3513509	3514871	I know, this is getting to be a little much.
3514891	3519654	Wii Sports in a case, because they got it in a case in... I could agree with that.
3519815	3520215	Australia.
3520235	3524258	But that is, you know... No Ethernet port, which is kind of lame.
3525119	3526900	And this doesn't even have anything to do with it.
3526960	3528181	Club Nintendo for the US.
3530403	3530884	Well, it's cool.
3530944	3535928	They get the points and stuff, and they get the free DS... Was it those...
3537327	3538047	Games and stuff.
3538147	3540848	How hard would it really be for Nintendo to go back and add some of this stuff, though?
3540868	3542448	They have built the updates to be pretty easy.
3542888	3544529	They could add the music channel if they wanted.
3544809	3546529	And who says that's not coming later on?
3546569	3550550	I mean, they said that there's a bunch of surprises, and we'll see some in the next few weeks.
3550570	3551090	All right.
3552190	3552730	It's not hard.
3553811	3554211	We'll see.
3555571	3556411	You know what I want?
3556591	3556771	What?
3557191	3559532	I want freaking region-free, but no.
3560592	3563833	Yeah, they've confirmed it is region-locked, the Wii is, so...
3565629	3566710	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3590768	3591108	We'll see.
3611161	3624687	and then it locked out that whole thing where people were going into the shop channel and turning it into a browser which was kind of pointless because you couldn't do much with the browser but I think it was just one of more of those things where somebody wanted to be able to do it to say they did it.
3625147	3627048	Well, Nintendo put the smack down on that.
3628068	3631130	You could do it and they're still working on a way around that.
3632050	3633531	It's turning into the PSP now.
3633591	3640574	How can we hack away their little, you know, and then they'll update and then somebody finds another hack to get what they want and then they'll update.
3641661	3660674	PSP all over again it's still going on so you know sooner or later and also the other thing too is people were able to download virtual console games off of the server so all they have to do is figure out how to encode them and you'd be pirating games off of their servers so yeah that's probably another reason why they wanted to fix that
3661192	3664314	Yeah, Nintendo may be already looking into making sure that doesn't happen.
3664795	3665175	We'll see.
3665315	3671900	Didn't they change, like, because you could browse the virtual console stuff on the web, but then they changed that where now it's all certificate-based or something like that?
3671920	3676904	Yeah, it's all certificate-based, and now it checks the IP instead of just the URL.
3677164	3678926	But I think people are going to find ways around that.
3679046	3680066	It's just a matter of time.
3680307	3681107	That's really what it is.
3682702	3687684	Now, speaking of updates to the Virtual Console, there are going to be some more games coming out on Monday here.
3688404	3690265	And some good stuff.
3690525	3691566	Donkey Kong Jr.
3692326	3694567	for the NES is going to be making its way out there.
3694587	3702530	And then on the Genesis, we've got Columns, Rizstar, and Victory Run for, I believe, the TurboGrafx-16.
3703070	3705131	So, not too bad.
3706112	3706432	I don't know.
3706732	3707452	I want some more games.
3707472	3709293	Rizstar was Saturn, wasn't it?
3710153	3710413	No.
3710493	3711934	No, that was, I'm thinking of another game, sorry.
3713019	3713760	It was Genesis.
3714280	3718083	Anyways, I want my Super Mario Brothers, goddammit.
3719485	3723388	I want Super Mario World, and I want Kid Icarus.
3724589	3725910	I want Kid Icarus so bad.
3726731	3727851	I want it so bad.
3727871	3729713	I hope that's the one game they're like,
3730137	3733881	Oh, by the way, for some reason this just wouldn't work with a virtual console.
3734982	3741429	I will poke Reggie in the eye myself if they can't get Kid and Chris working on the Wii virtual console.
3741870	3744112	I will drive up to Redman and poke him in the eye.
3744352	3746355	I want them to emulate TurboDuo.
3748137	3751200	Because I want Dracula X. Dream on.
3753191	3756813	No offense, but, I mean, do you think that's high on their priority list right now?
3756853	3757453	I know it should be.
3757473	3759414	No, but it would be very easy.
3759874	3763556	It's a freaking Super Nintendo game with real audio, is what it is.
3763656	3764336	I mean, seriously.
3764996	3766497	But, yeah.
3766537	3768418	That would be my bit of heaven right there.
3768898	3769938	I would pay for that.
3770018	3776621	I mean, so that I don't have to gingerly handle my, you know, CD and go, oh, please don't scratch, please don't scratch.
3776641	3777502	Where's one of the burns of it?
3777942	3778922	Okay, my burn doesn't work.
3778982	3779242	Damn.
3779763	3781463	Because that's what I go through every time I play that game.
3782364	3782764	All right.
3783408	3796038	or one other thing Jamie goes through every week is that she likes to open up the mailbag and read some emails that you guys send in to us at mailbag at orangelaundradio.com and she reads the mails and responds to them right here on our program.
3796278	3797699	And she's going to do that right now.
3805105	3808767	Well, the first one comes from someone named Guy.
3810008	3811630	Actually, apparently one of our listeners from the U.K.,
3813055	3819018	Hey, by the way, Guy, I was kind of mad that you weren't in the Final Fight they put on Super Nintendo until way later.
3819499	3822460	I just wanted to point that out because Guy was my favorite.
3825542	3826202	Sorry, go ahead and read.
3826222	3827263	I actually have Final Fight Guy.
3827343	3828183	Read the damn email.
3828303	3828663	Sorry.
3828964	3830224	Did I tell you about my Final Fight collection?
3831105	3833266	I was trying to collect every version of Final Fight.
3833446	3835327	Dude, they need to put Final Fight Guy on Virtual Console.
3835347	3836207	I have Final Fight Guy, though.
3837348	3837888	Anyway, sorry.
3838528	3839009	With the box.
3839209	3840289	We totally just lost a listener.
3840329	3840569	Sorry.
3841110	3841450	Hi.
3841470	3841510	Hi.
3842595	3845576	I don't get why all the movies and games are out in America before in England.
3845656	3848097	Is it because America is a bigger financial target?
3848397	3848977	Thanks, Guy.
3849397	3850218	What's your speculation?
3851318	3852158	It's your TVs.
3852899	3853379	It's your TVs.
3853399	3859361	Because they have to convert everything for the other format, and I think that's what causes things to get delayed.
3859781	3863643	Everyone needs to have an HDTV, and then it won't matter.
3864063	3870605	So maybe in five years, because HDTV's picking up more and more, but for right now, yeah, it's your TVs.
3871782	3873503	I've got my Gorillaz DVDs.
3873843	3874544	They're PAL.
3875024	3876706	I had to run through my laptop into the TV.
3877607	3877987	So, yeah.
3884482	3887904	You know, videos and things of that nature because you guys get a lot more music stuff over there.
3887925	3889045	Oh, it's Region 2, but it's PAL.
3889085	3889606	Exactly.
3889946	3897151	Or I remember one big thing that I had friends doing was that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was out on DVD over there way sooner than it was over here.
3897231	3897812	Highlander.
3897932	3901134	So... When the Highlander... Because this is when I was in college at first.
3901154	3904977	When the Highlander series came out, the UK versions had extra footage.
3905317	3908600	So take comfort that once in a while you get something the nerds really want.
3908640	3911762	You get them unedited and freaking Torchwood has like...
3912342	3927417	blood and sex and language and I love it so sorry I had to go off on that because I was watching Torchwood and going wow this wouldn't make it here anyway we have one from Miso says I'm Miso Skye
3929211	3931833	Is the creation of video games similar to an art form?
3932193	3934095	I think it is, as it involves creativity.
3934655	3938538	It could be closely related to theater arts because it is a collaborative art.
3938598	3942301	You have your music people, your writers, your technical people, so I think it could be an art form.
3942381	3943162	Happy Yule, Miso.
3944232	3944632	I agree.
3945192	3947513	I think it's very similar to a movie.
3947893	3950313	It's like an interactive movie, especially these days.
3950673	3953134	I mean, movies, storyboarded.
3953774	3954914	Games, storyboarded.
3955414	3957295	There's similarities between the way that they go.
3957315	3958935	You're scripting and the concept and everything.
3959575	3962036	I think it's a visual art form.
3962476	3965597	I mean, sometimes when you say art form, people want to compare it to paintings.
3965657	3966837	They want to compare it to Picasso.
3966937	3969757	No, art's a lot of different things.
3970118	3972198	Well, it's like spoken word is art.
3973121	3973721	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3997572	3998372	Okay, when you play it.
3998833	4002134	You can't tell me that's not an art form, like a movie.
4002194	4004855	Well, even the actual physical art that goes into it.
4004915	4009916	I mean, we had, what was the... That's right, the art, the bonus disc that has all the actual, like, art.
4010597	4011557	Or, um... Like, drawn art.
4011737	4013698	The gallery showings they had at E3.
4013958	4014358	Oh, sure.
4014378	4016139	Oh, the IM8 bit and all that stuff?
4016799	4017579	That was that book I got you.
4017859	4018760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4018780	4019740	But that was a gallery, too.
4020920	4021981	The pixel one, too.
4022641	4022721	Yeah.
4022781	4023821	Well, you know where we're going with this.
4023841	4024022	Yeah.
4024402	4024762	But, yeah.
4025062	4025122	Um...
4025649	4027691	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4046667	4050650	You guys pulled through for me as I waited for a wee and did not manage to get one.
4051150	4055513	Many people asked what I was listening to since I was sitting still for a few hours, so I just had to tell them.
4056054	4057375	About your amazing show, of course.
4057415	4057915	Good PR.
4057955	4058235	Hehe.
4059096	4059396	Thank you.
4059516	4060157	Good job.
4060217	4061318	The OL Army salutes you.
4062238	4066541	I have also spread the word at school to let OLR widely known amongst my fellow classmates.
4066681	4070504	I work on the school newspaper and I write the entertainment column, so I decided to spread some love.
4071885	4073526	I'm going to keep this short.
4073646	4075668	I have to study for exams, so peace and love to all.
4076533	4077293	That was very sweet.
4078154	4078534	That's it?
4078594	4081475	They just wrote to write in what the great PR they're doing?
4082076	4082576	Well, thank you.
4082696	4083596	I mean, we really appreciate that.
4083636	4087098	That's, you know, because, you know, we do do this for free and all that stuff.
4087138	4102005	That's really, if you feel like you want to give us something, give us word of mouth because we don't have the luxury of, you know, a corporate sibling magazine that can run four-page ads, you know, every month for our little dumb show or, you know, we don't have,
4102643	4107847	The corporate tie-ins, the companies that we rely on word of mouth and things of that nature to get our name out there.
4107947	4112189	So if you feel like you want to give us something, you don't have to give us your money.
4112250	4113710	Give us your word of mouth.
4114111	4114811	I'll tell you what, though.
4115151	4116572	Give us your loyalty and your soul.
4116792	4117453	I'll tell you what, Ricky.
4117933	4120055	If you shoot me an email, I'd actually like to see the newspaper.
4120715	4123977	So I will pay for the cost of the newspaper and shipping via PayPal.
4124418	4124698	Sweet.
4124758	4127720	If you want to send me a copy so that we can see the article.
4127740	4128140	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4128809	4129009	Anoush
4153695	4155216	says, Hi Jamie, Rob, and Matt.
4155576	4159298	Rob, I was wondering if you guys will be doing an OLR meetup like you did in New York City.
4159618	4161099	Anyway, have a great show, you guys.
4161539	4161799	Where?
4162920	4163580	That's a good question.
4164119	4164479	I don't know.
4165380	4168744	Well, I guess this is going to be an opportunity to talk about live appearances that we're doing.
4169225	4173669	Really, the next thing we have scheduled is that we're going to do, at least I'm going to be at for sure.
4173729	4175772	I don't know about my two partners in crime here.
4176132	4182379	I will be at SakuraCon in April in Seattle, and there's going to be at least hopefully one panel that goes with that.
4183260	4186083	That's the only live thing I have scheduled for right now.
4186573	4187353	I may or may not be
4209147	4211408	But we really want to go back to Canada because we love Vancouver.
4211949	4213990	And he's never been to Hawaii, so I want to go to Hawaii.
4214250	4218692	I'm also planning, and this is still up in the air as I have to find a good package deal and everything.
4219132	4226035	I'm planning for hopefully around Christmas, New Year 2007 of going to London.
4226856	4228516	I definitely want to do the UK at some point as well.
4228656	4233939	And I know we have a lot of great listeners over there who I'd love to meet up with for tea and crumpets at some point.
4234810	4235931	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4252244	4252604	Kyle Snyder
4279656	4280256	Dude, sweet.
4280296	4286279	Kyle Snyder, for those who don't know, we used to do pretty much exclusively a show about DDR.
4286779	4289500	So, Kyle Freestyler for DDR.
4290221	4291741	Music writer extraordinaire.
4291881	4293402	Does music, his own stuff as well.
4293722	4298724	He's a bit of a celebrity amongst the... He's like a DDR celeb.
4298844	4304487	He's like up there with the Mel B's and the Mr. Wendels and the folks you well know in the freestyle world.
4305627	4307808	Anyway, we still have the... You know what?
4307948	4308449	You know what?
4308769	4309109	People...
4309673	4312895	to this day still mimic that butterfly freestyle.
4313276	4314056	So you know what?
4314156	4317059	That's the ultimate compliment.
4317139	4318580	Imitation is the finest form of flattery.
4318600	4320281	He is the William Hung of the DDR community.
4323131	4336216	Dear crew of OLR, As you are aware, I have been back from my mission for almost two months.
4337176	4342438	I'm only going to be creating one more song on my current music mixing program before I get a new and better one, Acid.
4343519	4349501	My new song should be up in about two weeks after the song and after I get a new music mixing program and my
4350509	4352410	My new music should hopefully sound better.
4352790	4356132	I'm planning on creating a remix to I Can Never Be Japanese.
4356772	4358313	Most likely a happy hardcore remix.
4358333	4359274	That'll be fun, actually.
4360214	4364997	Is there anything you would like for me to work on for future songs such as Eurobeat, Gabba, Electro, or any other genre?
4365457	4369960	I might not have a lot of time to create music starting mid-January since I'll be starting college at that time.
4370340	4371561	One of your fans, Kyle Snyder.
4371841	4372161	P.S.
4372241	4373962	I plan to major in biotechnology.
4374462	4374842	Wow.
4374983	4376123	That's pretty hardcore.
4376143	4376483	Good luck.
4378164	4378625	You know, I...
4379858	4380958	Thank you for watching!
4401007	4406191	You know, I say save something really good for that because I think you'd want to be in a video game, wouldn't you?
4406491	4407052	That's pretty cool.
4407092	4408733	And that goes for anybody out there who's making music.
4409013	4416758	My advice in this actually, because a lot of what goes in physical art goes into music art, you know, go where your instincts lead you.
4416818	4417879	Don't stick to a style.
4418559	4419160	Experiment.
4420080	4426825	You know, even if it comes out like complete crap, if you've learned something from it, then you've progressed.
4427205	4428046	That's what I have to say.
4429224	4430324	So, moving on.
4432165	4436087	We have one actually from the Sober Irish guy.
4436787	4437367	That's cool.
4437727	4438168	The one.
4438368	4438708	The one.
4439648	4439928	Okay.
4440929	4446691	As first off, generic thanks and praise like things from Ireland, your show has landed onto the Irish scene.
4448351	4450012	Anyway, onto something important-ish.
4450112	4453914	I've been listening to the downloads and loving them for quite a while now, but I need to make a request.
4454354	4457275	Every time you give release dates for the UK, this is going to now...
4458145	4459586	I see, this is the email that inspired that.
4459846	4461327	I always think, well, that's not me.
4462067	4463968	And for the past 90 years anyway.
4464528	4472832	Since you're always talking about European gamers and how we keep getting screwed with release dates and Babani releases, they don't actually exist over here.
4472872	4473612	Thanks a lot, Konami.
4474272	4476393	Any chance of getting European release dates?
4477274	4478554	I actually am working on it.
4478694	4480075	I need to find some sources.
4480135	4481616	What I'm thinking about doing is actually...
4482702	4487929	Sending in some of my PR contacts at some of the various companies and seeing if they'll give me international estates.
4488188	4497034	Keep in mind, guys, and trust us, we love our international listeners, and we love the fact that this little show that we do out of the spare bedroom goes everywhere, everywhere in the world.
4497234	4498635	That's like the ultimate compliment.
4498935	4506460	But keep in mind, we can't do everybody, because, you know, like India just got the 360, so they've probably got their own release dates, and I'm sure we've got at least one listener there.
4506800	4508942	And, you know, I'd love to do those release dates, too.
4508982	4511844	We would do a show of nothing but release dates.
4512064	4512644	But we'll try.
4512864	4514085	We'll try to do at least the big titles.
4515246	4518088	Well, my idea for this is to do quarterly updates.
4518828	4525090	for major countries like, for example, for India, for South America, for Africa.
4525510	4525831	Africa.
4526711	4527891	Sorry, I couldn't pass that up.
4528431	4531312	Here are those new screenshots of Africa out there on the interweb.
4533253	4542096	Also, though, for any place that's got similar dates but deviations, I'm going to actually try doing different compilations for my list and seeing if I can't be a little more accommodating.
4543190	4543771	All right.
4544631	4549534	We'll do what we can, but we do appreciate your suggestion and listening to us in other countries.
4549694	4552676	You also addressed another part to me about Aragon.
4553657	4553877	Really?
4554177	4556699	Because you know I was complaining about how poorly written the book is.
4557379	4561602	Well, basically to go into the rest of this email...
4562914	4566277	I've read Eragon, and while it did start a little badly written, I enjoyed it.
4566317	4570100	But then again, I've read a lot of fantasy, both bad and good, Dragonlance and Discworld respectively.
4570460	4574943	I actually like Dragonlance, but I also played a lot of D&D when I was into Dragonlance.
4576044	4580127	Eragon is a bit slow-paced, and the overall story is good, even if the writing isn't terribly great.
4583354	4589137	I have been getting some feedback on the book just from my friends, you know, locally, emails I've gotten.
4589917	4602904	I have started reading it again, even though I've been distracted by copious amounts of Doctor Who and the fact that I'm into reading historical biography now and anthropology books.
4603164	4605685	So I'll set some time aside for it.
4605905	4606986	I'll give it another chance.
4607366	4608787	This story could be better than the writing.
4609287	4612889	I've read worse fan fiction, so I'm going to give it a go.
4614125	4637639	so um the end closing says anyhow that's it from this side of the Atlantic keep up the show and keep uploading it uh GMT9 is not a good time to be awake um I also sort of want to wake up like in the you know middle of the morning for myself and say hey overseas people listen to me because I am randomly awake on the weekends that early so
4639032	4652143	Moving forward, last email comes... Oh, I just want to say real quickly, some of our tape shows, such as the new STFU show that's not live, it's taped, we might actually play those at an hour that would be friendly for the folks overseas.
4652183	4655906	We are exploring doing that, because it's really easy for us to do the rebroadcast of the tape shows.
4656266	4658368	So, something to look forward to.
4659729	4663212	Last one comes from Robert.
4664193	4665814	I really missed you guys this week.
4666955	4668236	Aw, thank you for missing us.
4668849	4681351	Anyway, I've just unlocked the first bonus mission on Elite Beat Agents, and although I'm nowhere near ready to say I'm all that good at the game yet, I was wondering if there's a soundtrack mode or audio test mode unlockable in the game to listen to the music outside of the game.
4681931	4684632	It's amazing the amount of digital audio they were able to fit into that cartridge.
4686912	4687532	I don't know of any.
4688252	4691973	I'm sure someone might figure out a little hack or crack for the cartridge.
4692873	4697414	I would say, honestly, the songs are so close to their originals that
4697779	4698780	Well, not always.
4698900	4700061	Like, some are sped up.
4700301	4701602	Like, a couple of the songs are sped up.
4701642	4703183	So I guess I could see why you'd want that.
4704044	4704524	You never know.
4704584	4708007	Some folks are able to creatively rip from the game.
4708067	4708808	Some people do that.
4709448	4713912	Check some of those various sound archive sites, especially for those really big and import games.
4713952	4714673	I'll bet you see something.
4714973	4716514	You know what we had to do back in the 80s?
4717215	4721378	We held up our boombox to our TVs and recorded it, and we liked it.
4721618	4722819	That might be how you have to do it.
4722999	4723319	I don't know.
4724581	4725101	So that's it.
4725241	4725641	That was it?
4725701	4726222	No more emails?
4727458	4727918	How sad.
4728118	4728618	That's all right.
4728978	4729478	Send us more.
4729578	4731439	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4731499	4732539	We love to hear from you.
4733279	4735900	Someone who doesn't like to hear from you so much is Capcom.
4736980	4741801	They totally ignored the folks who were bitching about Dead Rising text being too small.
4742241	4746321	And I guess in a way, you know, I'm teasing them a little bit, but what could they really do?
4746541	4748822	I mean, do you think that is something that really could have been patched?
4748922	4750362	That's a pretty big game element.
4750742	4753163	I don't think that's something that could have been delivered in an itty-bitty patch.
4753223	4754843	So I think they realized they botched it there.
4755270	4757053	Or at least I thought they realized they botched it there.
4757153	4759938	Then the Lost Planet demo came out.
4760018	4762061	I haven't played it yet, but I've seen pictures of it.
4762141	4764345	And yes, the text, once again, uber small.
4764365	4766669	But this time, they've changed it.
4767810	4797403	folks were bitching on the internet about the small text and so Capcom sent out some screenshots and said hey listen you jerks who keep bashing us we fixed it here's a screenshot to prove it remember that beta games and test games are not always indicative of the final release STFU bitches in so many words is what they said but their last game which pretty much is their only game on the 360 right now had small text and that was indicative of the demo
4797904	4799606	So, what do you expect?
4799746	4802670	I mean, they're just going based off of their prior track record.
4803090	4805433	Well, I'm sure Capcom's learned their lesson.
4805853	4806254	Well, good.
4806274	4808216	I'm glad it took them only one game to do that.
4809497	4811159	So, you know, that's always good.
4811179	4815684	I guess I'm spoiled because I am an HDTV owner, and I didn't find the text in Dead Rising to be that bad.
4816225	4816926	It wasn't that bad.
4816986	4817807	It wasn't that bad at all.
4818109	4824594	Yeah, but again, you have Mondo, Hugh, Joe TV in the living room, and you have a TV that's bigger than mine, too.
4824875	4829298	So we're all spoiled, you know, for our friends on standard TVs.
4829338	4829678	Really?
4830299	4831340	You didn't think it was a pain in the ass?
4831480	4831600	No.
4831640	4831960	Or blurry?
4833061	4837725	The only thing I noticed was my monitor's too dark, so I can't see anything when it turns night.
4837925	4838946	Then people just complain too much.
4838986	4839626	I don't know what to tell you.
4839947	4840087	But...
4840427	4841267	Whatever.
4841367	4843188	So anyways, issues that need to be ironed out.
4843268	4851731	Well, apparently the new movie and TV download service for Microsoft's Xbox 360 has a little bit of some issues there.
4852431	4854892	For example, the movie downloads.
4855432	4856933	Way too damn slow.
4858213	4861915	I haven't really tried it yet because I don't really... Neither have I. There's not a damn thing on there I want.
4862255	4862875	Yeah, it's just...
4864736	4869418	I was going to get Star Trek Generations, but then it wasn't in HD.
4869518	4871118	So I was like, well, forget it.
4871258	4873198	I only want to do this because it has HD movies.
4873639	4878280	So bring me more HD movies I'm interested in and I'll maybe take a look.
4878660	4881761	I've also heard issues of people downloading stuff and getting something else.
4882681	4887042	But apparently they are going about to fix this stuff and
4888082	4898428	I guess for the first initial downloads, if you did download something or tried to download something and got your credits taken away and weren't able to download it, they will be refunding you your points and stuff.
4899669	4901530	It's a work in progress.
4902490	4906533	Once again, they really need to test this stuff before they go and release it.
4906753	4907833	It's like a lot of the games.
4908074	4909855	Oh, it goes out.
4911375	4915918	Can you really test thousands of people downloading your movie at once, though?
4916892	4918432	Yeah, it's called an online beta test.
4919813	4920813	They have stress tests.
4921593	4922253	That's what they do.
4922333	4923513	That's what a stress test is.
4923573	4927834	You test to see if your servers can handle people downloading stuff.
4928755	4935376	I remember when I was testing Test Drive Unlimited, they would have you, okay, we need everybody to go to this one spot and start a race.
4935836	4940037	We're going to see if this spot can handle the stress test of thousands of people doing that.
4940557	4941177	And that's what they do.
4941217	4943458	They specifically try to break it.
4943858	4943978	And
4944924	4974556	obviously they're just not testing it enough and same with like network play how the fuck you on you know like playing Call of Duty 3 or something like that not know especially after the last one that the online play is gonna be laggy as fuck and you release the game anyways to make it there for the holiday rush you know you know right away that's not gonna work but you just plan on patching it later it's kind of like oh well whatever it's good enough for now you know we'll patch it later people buy it anyways and they do because how are they supposed to know
4978042	4988189	Well, speaking of the other things that are going to be available, at least online and beta testing, there is going to be a beta test for Halo 3, a public beta.
4990131	4991932	The sign-up begins on the 4th.
4992352	4993473	That's this Monday.
4994233	4997075	So people will already be listening by that point, hopefully.
4998516	5004721	But you would have to go to Halo3.com on Monday and start your sign-up.
5006479	5015843	They're basically saying that Halo 3 beta will be available in the US, Europe, other places internationally, and they are going to keep the updates through that site.
5016443	5017644	So that's good.
5017704	5023906	But if you don't manage to get in on that, though, there are going to be premium multiplayer maps for Halo 2 coming out as well.
5024407	5025527	This is going to be available in the spring.
5025787	5030049	And there's going to be more info on the beta in the next coming weeks, according to our Microsoft reps.
5030869	5032650	We bugged him when we first had this.
5032710	5034491	We're like, how can you get us in?
5035419	5037580	Have you bugged him about that whole March release date?
5037620	5038701	Is that what they're still sticking to?
5039301	5040661	No, he wasn't the one that told you that, though, right?
5040681	5041582	He wasn't the one that told me that.
5041782	5043823	I haven't bugged him yet about that.
5044183	5048225	Well, just to say I am going to try to sign up for the beta.
5048985	5049385	Can we?
5049625	5051406	Doesn't this show disqualify us from that?
5051666	5052527	Or are you just all going to lie?
5055268	5064052	We don't get paid for it, so... I signed up for the Shadowrun beta, which is also this week, for the 360, so that might be another one if you want to try to get in on something.
5064707	5065947	That's another thing that's going on, too.
5065987	5069069	Well, it's sort of a part for... We're going to get reports on it anyway, is how I see it.
5069169	5070989	But my whole thing is, I love beta testing.
5071429	5076171	Well, you know, I tried to sign up for a beta test, and the first question they asked was, do you work for a gaming website or whatever?
5076191	5078372	I put, yeah, because, you know, that's kind of what we do here.
5078752	5079232	No, no, no.
5079252	5079753	It booted me.
5079773	5080313	No, no, no.
5080773	5082153	Work implies that you get paid.
5082193	5082814	I guess that's true.
5082834	5084054	Therefore, I do not work.
5084474	5088896	The way the question was worded, I wanted to... You know, and I'm not going to lie.
5089440	5097167	But just for a silly beta test, the way it was worded, and I don't want to say what site it was for, but it was a pretty major gaming operation.
5098208	5101270	I was signing up, and it booted me right out for that.
5101410	5103872	I've gotten selected for quite a few beta tests lately.
5103912	5109757	I've actually gotten selected for betas through... Well, fuck you and fuck you, because I don't get paid for anything.
5109998	5111839	Through the media mailings, because I'll have the media send it.
5111859	5113260	I did the Phantasy Star Universe beta.
5113280	5114081	I guess that's something.
5114401	5115242	Everybody did that, though.
5115723	5115983	All right.
5116451	5117372	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5130997	5133438	Xbox Live with a full co-op mode
5153604	5155425	So, gonna be the arcade version, I'm sure.
5155705	5159146	Online co-op, probably be pretty cool, as long as it's not laggy as hell.
5159166	5160286	So I hope you did your stress test.
5160546	5164968	Yeah, I was gonna say, as long as it's able to stay synced, unlike Contra.
5164988	5169129	I still haven't played Contra online.
5169970	5170750	None of my friends have it.
5170910	5172290	I'm like the only one of my friends that hasn't.
5172430	5173011	I have Contra.
5173191	5173451	Do you?
5173831	5174351	Let's play!
5174651	5175972	Let's get some achievements online!
5176652	5177072	Points!
5178112	5178432	That's all.
5179913	5180213	Are you sure?
5181633	5181774	Yep.
5182474	5183074	Are you sure you're sure?
5184127	5184387	Yes.
5184747	5185948	Okay, okay, okay.
5186628	5196092	Well, anyway, Microsoft, speaking of which, has decided that they are going to release the 1080p fix.
5197412	5198953	It's a dashboard update.
5200694	5206976	Basically, when you log into Xbox Live, the patch is supposed to fix everything.
5207737	5211558	You don't have to download the update, but you can't connect to Live until you do.
5211758	5213239	I was going to say, I don't think
5215059	5218380	I got the patch last night when I was playing one of those Burger King games and it made me do it.
5219261	5220721	But I'm pretty much always on live.
5223163	5226784	It's also trying to improve the accuracy of the reporting on things.
5226804	5229506	You'll see changes to your recently played games.
5230106	5230966	Oh, interesting.
5231327	5231887	Alright, cool.
5232467	5235208	I couldn't tell you what it did for 1080p though because my TV didn't support it.
5235749	5242352	It's supposed to also have improved plug and play for your headsets and the wireless controllers.
5243005	5244026	Again, something I don't have.
5257417	5280502	So one thing I'm kind of a little sad about, and so far I haven't really tried it, so I'm not really sure if this has affected anything yet, but apparently Microsoft is taking precautions and blocking some of the Europe live users that are using the region workaround to be able to download demos that are available to the U.S.
5281102	5285523	And apparently they are blocking the accounts, not necessarily banning them,
5286195	5290498	And I've done this, you know, over here to download Japanese demos and stuff.
5290918	5291498	And it's fun.
5292619	5296522	But so far, they've only confirmed that they've been blocking the UK ones.
5296902	5300244	They've been blocking them from downloading our demos and whatnot.
5301104	5303126	Apparently some licensing issues or something.
5303226	5303586	I don't know.
5304086	5306488	But whatever.
5307068	5307669	We're next.
5308669	5309470	We're not next.
5309610	5310210	We're spoiled.
5311331	5312191	But I don't know.
5312211	5312892	I haven't tried it yet.
5312972	5314633	So we'll see.
5315322	5316462	I guess we'll see.
5316602	5319743	Now, this was causing some rumors to go around that they were banning people, right?
5320103	5323063	But then they came out and said, no, we're not banning anyone, just blocking.
5323503	5324724	Yeah, it's just blocking people.
5324744	5327324	I mean, because, really, they're just silver accounts anyway.
5327344	5330365	So, I mean, yeah, sure, go ahead, ban the silver account.
5330745	5331585	Can't just, like, create a new one.
5331605	5336006	Yeah, but, you know, folks are starting rumors that, oh, your gold that's on the same system is going to get banned, too.
5336066	5338406	And I'm like, that would cause problems.
5338446	5339526	No, we don't want money.
5341306	5341606	Right.
5342007	5342307	All right.
5342347	5343867	Well, regardless, the mere...
5345131	5345371	F.U.S.
5345572	5347254	of the Week
5372847	5373507	Yes, that's right, kids.
5373527	5375929	This is the part of the show where we get ranty and angsty.
5376429	5381073	And who better to start us off when it comes to rants and angst than DarkSakura?
5381973	5386777	Amazingly enough, I am not angsty about anything today.
5387377	5388178	I'm not ranty.
5388718	5389759	I'm on new medication.
5391200	5393021	Hell froze over, ladies and gentlemen.
5393401	5394022	It's happened.
5394602	5396383	Somebody's skiing in hell right now.
5396483	5397284	Jamie's not angsty.
5397304	5398345	I'm just fucking with you.
5398365	5398845	No, um...
5399235	5401577	I'm glad to hear things are socially happy.
5401597	5405820	We finally found a treatment that's helping me with my chronic disease.
5405940	5409363	But we finally found something that helps, so I'm not really all that upset about much.
5409883	5411044	I'm pretty happy, actually.
5411484	5414667	Except for the person who took my blood at Kaiser.
5414687	5417809	He freaking always leaves bruises on me.
5418850	5420731	He's like, plot, plot, blood out.
5422773	5424554	Fine, but what about the bruise on my arm?
5425274	5426495	Oh, you do that anyway.
5426715	5428617	Because she's taken my blood a couple times before.
5429232	5430753	Like, whatever, lady.
5431874	5432895	Just, whatever.
5432975	5435957	I don't like walking around looking like a freaking heroin addict or something.
5436537	5439059	So, that's it.
5439099	5440320	Loki.
5440340	5442822	F you to my lower back right now.
5442882	5444603	It's apparently away from my bed.
5444623	5446664	It's situated in our bedroom.
5447545	5452008	I'm next to the window, and the window, because it's in an apartment, has horrible seals.
5452526	5458411	So, like, everything that's on the backside of my body, like my neck, my back, and everything are completely sore right now.
5458431	5463895	It feels like I've been in a fight or something, but it's just from the cold air because it's winter.
5464035	5465396	It sucks.
5465556	5467918	I feel like an old person, like, oh, my back!
5468778	5471460	So, yeah.
5471641	5481228	I'm relatively in good spirits as well, so I just have to say F you to being so busy, because, you know, it's the reason why I have to pre-tape tonight, and I got, you know, like,
5481884	5485545	Hey, this will put some of our listeners in even better spirits.
5485565	5486245	We have a story about lesbians.
5510613	5512454	All right, lesbians, hooray.
5513495	5523361	There was this story ran on this site called gamesradar.com, which I guess is actually some corporate website, but I'd never heard of it until this story, so whatever.
5524862	5530565	They are going over the top seven lesbian kisses in video games ever.
5532105	5536807	Let's see, it started off with number seven was Kitana and Mileena with their fatalities, right?
5536827	5541329	Because remember how Kitana would kiss Mileena and then she'd blow up and then, you know, all that stuff.
5541369	5544810	Or that Mileena would kiss Kitana and then, like, suck her in and, you know, that's it.
5544830	5546051	She'd eat her face or something.
5546651	5551873	Jade Empire came in at number six with their little girl-on-girl action on the eve of battle.
5552893	5554954	And they have a little hot picture to go with it there, so...
5555675	5556675	Fear Effect 2, Retro Helix
5584720	5587523	which was, you know, kind of an older game for PlayStation 1 on 2001.
5589025	5594129	And there's this chick, Hannah, and her applied lover, Rain.
5594730	5597673	They do a make-out in an elevator to distract some guards.
5598714	5599795	No nudity involved, though.
5601448	5605771	The number three hottest lesbian kiss in video games ever from GamesRadar.com.
5605791	5609654	They said Persephone and Niobe in Enter the Matrix.
5609754	5613697	I remember that one because I actually played Enter the Matrix on, I think it was GameCube.
5614297	5615638	And I remember that scene.
5615978	5621862	So that's some Monica Bellucci and Jada Pinkett action there in your live action clip.
5622923	5631009	And then in Leisure Suit Larry, Magna Cum Laude from the character Luba who likes to get naked and make out with chicks.
5631471	5631951	at number two.
5632712	5633552	I remember playing that game.
5633752	5640955	And the number one lesbian kiss game, Sims 2, with the do-it-yourself makeouts.
5641235	5649578	And they show a little clip here from The Sims 2 of some girls in scantily clad bikinis all over each other on their leopard print bed.
5649739	5650419	Now, wait a minute.
5650459	5652380	There was another game, though, I know that they had.
5652940	5654821	It was full nudity and everything.
5655261	5660343	I can't remember what it was called, though, because it was some other Sims-like knockoff game.
5661187	5666752	And I remember they did a, they were doing a thing on, um, it was on SomethingAwful.com.
5666832	5675479	They were doing, kind of reviewing the game and talking about how he'd make his characters, um, force them to be gay against their will type thing.
5675679	5676259	Interesting.
5676420	5681264	I, you know, and I'm trying to think, well, okay, where's the list of the top seven gay male kisses ever?
5681324	5683926	And I'm like, God, I can't hardly think of any games that have that.
5684106	5684206	Um,
5684713	5685113	I guess Bully.
5685133	5686814	Bully in Final Fantasy 7, I guess.
5686974	5687194	What?
5687594	5690994	Wasn't there a part with the whole gay thing in there?
5691155	5693375	There was the Barret date.
5693735	5695115	Oh, the Barret date!
5695135	5696596	That doesn't count.
5696716	5697796	I've got the Barret date.
5697816	5699837	There's no making out action in the Barret date.
5699997	5702797	What it is, some Japanese player decided to get the Barret date.
5703417	5710119	And so back when the Dex drive was really big and I downloaded a Dex file, translated it for the US one and played it on my PC.
5711419	5713400	on my game, and it was funny.
5713960	5714821	It was really funny.
5715101	5715621	Interesting.
5716161	5717282	The Yuffie one was stupid.
5717302	5718542	I've seen the Yuffie one as well.
5719063	5721183	I hate Aerith, so I'll have done myself a favor.
5721283	5725085	I'm pretty sure when I played through the game, that's who I went on the date with was Aerith.
5725545	5726125	She sucks.
5727186	5727666	I liked her.
5727686	5729567	She's dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.
5731067	5734729	But she'll always be talked about through flashbacks, so screw you, hippie.
5736370	5737730	Anyways, so speaking of...
5740487	5743969	I hope you weren't hurt that I didn't know your website, but most people don't know us, so we're used to it.
5744769	5750651	But you should do the top seven gay guy kisses for us to report on next week.
5750951	5761496	So anyways, speaking of games that are out there that kind of are interesting, there's a new Bubble Bobble game coming out for the DS.
5761656	5764037	Bubble Bobble Double Shot has been announced.
5764877	5768279	It's a co-op dinosaur game, and of course...
5769622	5771844	Bubble Bobble, but damn, damn
5791764	5796105	Oh, that was another one that came out I forgot to mention that's coming out next week here.
5796425	5798625	Bubble Bobble Evolution for the PSP.
5798905	5799425	Whoopee!
5800326	5801166	Yeah, so.
5802986	5803486	Hooray.
5804206	5804506	All right.
5805086	5809747	Something else that will be coming to you very soon is DarkSakura's website of the week.
5809807	5815968	She serves the internet all over to look for a website that she wants to share with you, and she has one for you right now.
5816028	5816949	It's her website of the week.
5817209	5819169	DarkSakura, tell the kids what it is.
5820791	5825192	This is a website that I'm sure everybody knows about and it's about damn time I mentioned it.
5825652	5828053	Today's website of the week is 4chan.org.
5828533	5830914	The number 4, C-H-A-N dot O-R-G.
5831734	5834955	4chan, where the internet also goes to die when it's not at Myspace.
5836155	5837256	Home of Catterday.
5839036	5844498	Home of lots of lovely, lovely Yowie and Yuri and...
5845600	5850201	Bungie Hentai and NECA and all kinds of art cosplay.
5850221	5851701	You want to know something funny?
5851841	5852041	What?
5852101	5853102	I've never been to this site.
5853142	5857163	I hear about it all the time, but I just have never thought to go to it.
5858623	5858763	Oh.
5859063	5860703	Isn't that, I don't know, am I weird?
5860923	5863284	4chan has lots of fun, but I love Caterday.
5864244	5867385	That sounds, that sounds worthy of a visitation.
5867605	5872906	Well, also, though, on 4chan, the other cool thing is in Oikaki Board, where basically you
5873550	5873950	Draw.
5874370	5883112	Oh, weren't those really huge on the internet a couple years ago where you'd have the paint program, basically, and you could save your paint and post it?
5883332	5883692	Yeah.
5883752	5884872	That was huge a few years ago.
5884952	5890513	I used to do... My very first Oekaki that I ever did was of Leafmon.
5890753	5891694	I don't like that name.
5892054	5893974	That sounds too close to Buekake.
5894494	5895814	No, that's Bukake.
5896355	5898175	I know it's Bukake, but it's close.
5898195	5900435	Bukake and Oekaki, I should say.
5900935	5903196	O-E-K-A-K-E, not Bukake.
5904554	5904994	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5927879	5933562	What's interesting is that there's some rumors going around about what's coming up with Final Fantasy VI on the Game Boy Advance.
5933642	5939104	And it's kind of rumor status because it was reported that you're going to be able to have the new characters.
5939344	5944567	You can do Leo and you can play as Emperor Gestalt, too, which I thought was a very strange character addition, you know.
5944827	5945988	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5964143	5993037	having new summons in the game Gilgamesh, Sabertender they will actually be there so at least you'll have that, something extra even if the fangirl fantasy of reviving Leo may in fact not be true but how hard would it be to just let them revive Leo already but I have to admit when I read the story it did sound a little bit too good to be true that it was going to be the Phoenix Esper that revived him and I'm kind of like that almost sounds a little too cliche, I don't know
5994625	5998707	I still would want to check this out, though, because Final Fantasy VI, good game.
5999087	5999587	Very good game.
6000427	6000968	Interesting.
6001388	6010571	Well, Elebits, which is coming out here in a couple weeks, is actually going to be having some Wii Connect 24 functionality, including level trading.
6011451	6015873	The custom levels are going to be used, basically built with a point system.
6015933	6021035	The points are charged for each item used to populate the level, including trash cans,
6021898	6024300	Elebits, Toy Tanks, etc.
6025120	6027522	It says no level can exceed 1,000 points.
6028442	6033185	Basically, the levels can be sent to your friends with screenshots.
6034106	6036807	And it's kind of a neat little thing.
6037008	6042451	Probably the first game I've seen actually utilize the Wii Connect 24 system, so looking forward to that.
6043001	6043721	Picking it up anyways.
6070413	6074476	Well, that was the last story that we had for you guys tonight.
6074576	6078838	Unfortunately, we have no Skype line tonight because we're not actually live.
6079599	6086163	But we will be back live next week at Orange Lounge Radio and, of course, inviting your calls as always and your participation.
6086183	6090346	I'm sure a lot of you have some built-up stuff, having no show last week and now a tape show this week.
6090886	6093508	But is there any last-minute stuff from Loki or DarkSakura?
6093788	6095029	Yeah, I've got a couple things.
6096050	6096550	I do as well.
6097076	6097997	Alright, Loki.
6098017	6099478	Well, no, let's start off with DarkSakura.
6099498	6100198	Why don't you start us off?
6100418	6110965	Just for UK news, for Football Manager 2007, Sega and Sports Interactive released a patch for the PC, Mac, and Intel Mac versions of Football Manager 2007.
6112246	6116629	Basically, the patch deals with some of the issues that the fans brought up.
6118078	6119659	like some of the bugs that were still in the game.
6120299	6126662	The patch is saved game compatible but to get the full effect you have to start a new game.
6128303	6132805	You can actually grab it from Sport Interactive's website over there.
6134845	6136946	I know it's kind of a big game over there so I thought I'd bring it up.
6137727	6138047	Alrighty.
6139948	6145290	If you're looking to use your old Nintendo and Super Nintendo controllers with the Wii Virtual Console games
6145982	6175335	a website called RetroZone which is at RetroUSB.com and this stuff is actually going to be slash Wii.html you can buy both the adapters for the NES and Super NES controllers and those are priced at $19 each including if you buy a second controller it will have free shipping so that's kind of neat and those would actually plug into your GameCube ports on the Wii so it's pretty cool
6176209	6184332	And then finally, apparently there's that hacking group Team Executor that was famous for a lot of the PSP stuff.
6185073	6195097	They've got the full-size SATA hard drive working with the PlayStation 3, and now they have 750 gigabytes on their one PlayStation 3.
6195137	6195777	For what?
6197267	6197827	For what?
6198107	6199127	For what, you may say?
6199447	6202048	Well, they're working on running the Blu-ray games.
6202088	6202848	For porn.
6203088	6204368	For 750 gigs of porn on your PS3.
6204988	6207109	For running the Blu-ray games off the hard drive.
6208269	6208689	All right.
6208829	6209189	I see.
6209949	6210409	Interesting.
6211310	6211730	So that's it.
6212170	6212470	All right.
6212910	6215691	Well, that's going to do it then for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
