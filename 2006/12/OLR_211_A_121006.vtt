Porridge Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
We're the hosts, Bart Sakura, Sky, and Moto.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, December 10th, 2006.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
Microsoft gets sued over brick 360s, the old Apple entering the console market rumor resurfaces,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
and is the Playstation 3 harming the acceptance of Blu-ray?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
We are that video game program dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts and unfortunately not joining us this week is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
But we do have the ferret to speak for her in her plays.

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
She's actually in L.A. this week. She's spinning around on the teacups back at Disneyland.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I know, again? She's at Disneyland again?

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Well, she's there with Chris and oh well.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
She's not here this week.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
She was going to call in with a special report, but I guess she got too dizzy because I didn't see anything on the Skype line.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
So, maybe she'll bug us later. I don't know.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
But in the meantime, the one and only Loki is joining us here tonight.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Yes, I am.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Alright, how you doing?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm doing okay.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Alright. It's kind of weird because we haven't been live in a while.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Like, since before Thanksgiving.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
You know, we missed that show Thanksgiving week and then we were pre-taped last week.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
And now, this week, it doesn't feel like a full thing because it's just you and me and there's no Dark Sakura.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
There's no special guests yet, although supposedly Miklotov's going to be here.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
But, like, an hour before we went live, they were like,

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
Bye! We're going to go play DDR at the bowling alley. And I'm like, dude, I've been wanting to go check out the machine for like three weeks.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
What machine?

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
There's supposedly a DDR Supernova at the bowling alley at Country Club.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
At the Ultra Ghetto Club?

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh, I hear Keys. They might be back now. I don't know. We'll see.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Well, in the meanwhile, while we figure out what's going on there, we'll start off the show how we always do it with a little bit of

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
How was your gaming week? Loki, how was your gaming week?

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
My gaming week is okay. I actually tried out Viva Pinata and I played it for about half an hour.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Until which the game decided I don't want to play it anymore.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
Which is ironic because I really didn't want to play it anymore because, well, it froze up on me.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
And the game itself was just very kind of boring.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
I mean, I got really bored with it really quick, so I plan on selling it back since I didn't pay for it in the first place.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
So, I don't know. Can't recommend it, but I guess if you stick with it long enough it might be fun.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I just found it very, very, very annoying.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
So, whatever.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Played more Excite Truck because that's fun. Played more Wii Sports.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
We've been doing more of the Wii Sports bowling.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
And my friend who's, you know, used to be in a bowling league was kicking our ass.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
So, whatever.

02:57.000 --> 03:06.000
And then, I don't know, just waiting for Elibits this week and actually I'm going to probably try to pick up Far Cry Vengeance as well.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
So, those would be fun.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
And, you know, more Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
And, I don't know. That's pretty much it.

03:16.000 --> 03:26.000
I know, was it, on Tuesday actually I'm going to be hooking up the Wii in our kind of giant theater at work that we have.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
For a demonstration for all the sales staff.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
And it's going to be kind of cool because we get to use my wireless sensor bar that I made.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
So, I'm going to be playing the Wii on a giant screen.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I actually tried it out on Friday and it worked out pretty good.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
So, looking forward to that.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
But, in the meantime, just kind of kicking back and waiting for some better games to come out.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
And, from the looks of things, it's going to be a little bit before some good stuff comes out.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
I do have a real quick story though that's unrelated to games slightly.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh, sure. Why not?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
We went go-kart racing today.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
And I'm not talking about the crappy go-karts at Golf Land, but actual indoor go-kart tracks.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
You know, the karts that go up to about 40 miles an hour and type stuff.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Is that that little place right up here?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I've always wanted to go there.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
Other than the fact that it hurts the hell out of my hands driving those things because there's no power steering on them, of course.

04:15.000 --> 04:24.000
I was able to successfully drift at 40 miles an hour thanks to video games because of how I learned to drift in Ridge Racer.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
The same logic applies and I was able to drift around corners pretty quick.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
And that's pretty awesome.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
So, you can learn something from games.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
What was the reason that you decided to go to RPM today?

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
My dad's birthday. We took him down there.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
What made him decide to do RPM of all places?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
He likes race cars.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
He likes to drag cars and everything.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
So, we thought it would be fun to go down there because I've never been down there.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
My sister asked. She actually goes down there quite a bit. She has a membership and stuff.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
So, I got a membership.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
It's kind of cool though because you have to suit up and like the whole jumpsuit and the helmet and everything.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
And there's people there that they have memberships.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
They buy their own helmets.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
They have their own jumpsuits, their own racing gloves.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
And it's just crazy.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
But it's pretty fun.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
They time your laps and everything.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
And you're basically racing against the clock.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
It sucks that the second car I got, because it's kind of like QZAR in a sense,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
the second car I got really sucked and the tires were all fucked up on it.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
So, it wouldn't grip it.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I kept spinning it out and hitting the wall.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
And I don't know. It was fun though.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Can you imagine what Loki must be like at one of these places?

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Yes, that's right. The music's starting.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And it's like, oh, it's like initial D.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
D! Ready, set, go!

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
Everything I need to know here I learned from initial D!

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Mega Drift!

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Damn, I left my little stupid Sega card at home. What am I going to do?

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
It was fun though. I mean, really, we should go do it.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Like this show.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
I think it would be fun. I think that's something we should put on YouTube.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
We could too, because you could film it.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Only if we get loaded before we go.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Don't drink and drive, kids. We're only kidding.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
But I thought I'd mention that though.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Oh, and I played a bit of Motorstorm at Kiosk at Best Buy.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
And I like it. I think it's kind of cool.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
But it's a lot slower though than Excite Truck.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
To be honest, I really wish that EA would do a Burnout off-road series.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
You know what Motorstorm did for me?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Oh, this game sucks!

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
That was Motorstorm.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
That's it. I played it at Target.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Hi, Miklotov! You decided to join us after all.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah, we just got back from the bowling alley. How's my mic?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I think you're okay. I might have to turn you up a little bit.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
But how are you doing?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I'm tired now.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
So you guys want to go play the new DDR without me?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Yeah.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, not the new, new DDR.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
The newest DDR.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
The newest DDR to us in Sacramento. How was it?

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Oh, I didn't realize how stupid I am when I make steps sometimes.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Oh, that's right, because you do steps for the game.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
Yeah, and we had to redo some steps a while ago for the UltraMix 1 songs.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
Like, I played Gorgeous 2012 on doubles and I played heavy.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
I don't know if many people realize, but it has new heavy steps.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
And so I was playing and I was like, oh, yeah, I remember making these. These are fun.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
And then it got to utter crap. I was like, what was I thinking?

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
And then I just gave up and died.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Was there a large crowd there playing DDR?

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
If me and Irene are a large crowd, then yeah, there was a very large crowd.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
All right, I'm trying to fix your mic here. How else was your gaming week?

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
I played more Elite Beat Agents, trying to S everything on hard rock.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Wow, I can hear myself.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
You're supposed to be able to.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
OK, yeah, I played Elite Beat Agents.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
I started playing Zelda again, and the fourth dungeon boss is the best boss fight I've ever played in my life.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
It was so cool.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
And I don't think I did anything else besides that.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
So it's just been Zelda all week long?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
No, because I don't play video games anymore.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
I hope you've been playing PSP and DS and all that stuff.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
PSP? When did I say I played PSP?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Or DS. I'm fine, DS.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Elite Beat Agents.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
That's it?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yes.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
It's my favorite game that I have on DS called Elite Beat Agents.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Say hello as well to someone else who's here.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Say hello to Rice Princess.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
God, we haven't seen you in forever.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Yeah, it's been a while.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
How was your gaming week? What have you been playing?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Nothing.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Elite Beat Agents.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
You've got to get real close to the mic. These mics are not very sensitive.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
What have you been playing?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Can you take a guess?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
I can.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
What is it, Jay?

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
It rhymes with ka-wow.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
You'd be right.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
It rhymes with World of BoarCraft.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah, shut up.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
That would be W.A.B.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Are you saying the World of BoarCraft?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Yes, you are World of BoarCraft.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
What server are you on? What character class are you?

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
What are you doing in the W.A.B.?

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
I'm on Elder Thallus and I BVB.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
All day long?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
All day long.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
All right.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Yep.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Well, have fun with your W.A.B.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I'll do that.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
All right.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Chirp, chirp, chirp.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
My gaming week, not a whole lot of new stuff.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
I decided to go back and rediscover GameTap because I haven't been playing it a lot lately,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
and so I decided to load that up, and they actually have some cool new stuff on there

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
because they have the Castlevania games and Contra games from the old school 8-bit NES

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
are on there, and Silent Hill 2 is on GameTap, which it looks very nice.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
I was very surprised.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
It looks better than it does on PS2 because it uses the advanced hardware on the computer

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
to give the smoother textures and things.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
I was very, very pleased with that, and you can really control the resolution and everything,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
so that was really cool.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And Civilization III.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
For those who have listened to the show in the past, you guys know I love Civilization.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
It's my favorite PC game of all time.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
Yet, Civilization II was such a shock to me that I just wrote off the series altogether.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
I had played Colonization, which was kind of cool, but I wrote off the series with Civilization II

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
because I'm like, this is too much.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
So I never did play Civ III or Civ IV.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
I never spent the money on it, but I went back and played Civ III, and it's not bad.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I like it a little more than Civ II.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
It seems to be a little bit truer to the original than Civ II was, so I'm kind of liking it.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
I'm going to go play it some more.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Good times.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Maybe I'll have to play some OLR listeners, because it's multiple.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
Although, I don't even know anyone else with GameTap besides our webmaster, VX JasonXV.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I'm still waiting for Myst Online to come out on there.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I have not played the Sam & Max game yet, though.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
I will at some point.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Definitely play that.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
Otherwise, I decided, based on a new forum we have in our Orange Launch Radio forums,

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
there's a PC gaming forum, and somebody had posted a thread about what freeware games

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
have you been playing.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
And I think Dartetsuya made a post that reminded me that there's a freeware game called Every

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
Extend, which the PSP game Every Extend Extra is based off of.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
So I decided, well, I played the Every Extend Extra demo, and I really sucked at it, so

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
I wanted to see if maybe I could try and pick up the game again.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
So I downloaded Every Extend, and it's actually pretty fun.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
It was a lot of fun, so much so that I decided to spend the $20 and get Every Extend Extra

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
on the PSP.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
So I'll know more about that game next week when I've actually played it some more.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
You found it today?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Yes, it was actually easy to find.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
GameStop has it cut down to $20.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Too bad GameStop is evil, but wow.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
Well, you know, I'll get it wherever I can get it, because I use their online search

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
for the store to shut up.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Also, I got a present.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Loki got me a Christmas present.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Can I play it right now?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
I got Final Fantasy III on the DS.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
No, you may not.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Please?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
No, you may not.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Well, I'm going to punch you in the face.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Then I will play it.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
Only I get to de-virginize my cartridge.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
You know that feeling, like when you buy a new game, you don't want someone else to

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
crap out your-

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Have sex with it first?

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Or someone else to crap up your game with their save file, right?

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
It's like, you want to be the first one to turn it on, see the opening cinema, all

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
that stuff.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
You don't want someone else to skank it up.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
So, I don't want you to dirty up my game.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
So, maybe next time you're here.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
That's in forever from now.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
It's not my fault you're going away for Christmas.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
I think it is.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
So, I'll know more about Final Fantasy III next week, because I just got it like 10 minutes

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
ago from Loki.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
You rock, Loki.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Thank you so much.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
You know what else I got for Christmas from Extrofer?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
I got my Christmas present from Extrofer today.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
I was there.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
No, I did not get an STD reference.

12:40.000 --> 12:46.000
I got a Hello Kitty toaster.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
I'm so excited.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
I can't wait.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
I need bread.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
I need bread.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I'm having my Christmas present.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
What?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
That'll be my Christmas present.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Awesome.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
When you got it, did you make a high-pitched squealing noise?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
I did.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
I thought I heard you from the bathroom.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
Hopefully, that was me and not something, you know, some bathroom noise.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
What?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Anyway, no, nothing.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I guess that's it for my gaming week.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
I don't really have anything else to share.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
So, anyway, let's go to a little bit of housekeeping.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
And I mentioned that there were some new forums on our website at orangesontradiocom, and

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
you should definitely go check those out.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
There's a new PC gaming forum available on orangesontradiocom, and every weeknight show

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
has their own forum now.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
So if you're a Pump Up the Volume fan, she's got a whole forum there, Dark Sakura.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
And if you like guys on a show, there's a forum for that.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
STFU on Thursdays, Travis Donovan on Saturdays, and something on Fridays.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
And then also we're in the process of revamping our news blog.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
So take a look for that this coming week.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Let's get into some gaming news now.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
We'll start it off with a little news about the Xbox 360.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
But this is the type of news that Microsoft is not going to be happy to hear.

14:03.000 --> 14:12.000
One of the Xbox Live users who goes by the name of Redrum6622, Redrum, Redrum, I love

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
the shining, claims he's filed a class action lawsuit against Microsoft because of some

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
problems he had after their recent fall system update.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
This was posted on the official Xbox forum, so you can kind of take this with a grain

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
of salt because it's an official Xbox forum post and those can be a little crazy.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
He basically said he filed this class action lawsuit, plaintiff versus Microsoft Corporation,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
a Washington Corporation, blah, blah, blah.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
And then their summary of claims, blah, blah, blah, legal mumbo jumbo one.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
This is a class action against Microsoft and its affiliates for breach of contract, violation

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
of the Washington Consumer Protection Act, and alternatively negligence.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and all other persons who experienced

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
hardware problems with their Microsoft 360 gaming consoles following installation of

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
Microsoft's fall 2006 update for the Xbox 360.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
The parties, plaintiff, name blocked, is an individual resident of California.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
Plaintiff is the original purchaser and current owner of an Xbox 360 gaming console.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
Plaintiff brings this action individually and as a class action under Rule 23 of the

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of the class specified herein, blah, blah,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
blah, blah, ipso facto, et cetera, et cetera.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
What do you think, Logy?

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
But he's saying that it's in violation of Washington law, yet he's a California resident.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Supposedly, that's what it is, yeah.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
Okay, and the other fact that the fall update only affected, the glitch in the fall update,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
I guess, only affected less than 1% of the 360s out there.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
You have to admit that's still a lot, though.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
Okay, that's true, to which any of them that were affected by that were immediately fixed

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
and replaced, you know, if you called the 1-800 number.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
So it's not like they're saying, fuck you, you're just out of 360.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
They're doing, you know, their part to fix it.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
So this is just some dumbass Californian who's trying to get more money from them.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Pooh-fucking-hoo, your damn 360 broke.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Send it in like everybody else and just get a new one.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
God, is it really that big a deal?

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
ShadowNextGen in our chat room, which, by the way, hi, chat room, chat.orangelauntrader.com

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
if you want to join.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
ShadowNextGen said, do just once attention.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Is that what's going on?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
He does once attention.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Well, now you have his gamertag, so fucking send him hate mail.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
There you go.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
OL Army Alex says, I can't prove my 360 having died, though my useless posts in the forums

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
and having called MS support twice count.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
In other words, like how are you going to prove that your 360 was bricked?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
I don't know.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I guess that's an interesting idea.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Let's see.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
There was another comment here.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Oh, Jumpman said, my 360 died.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Microsoft gave me a new one and all is right with the world.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
See?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Is it that hard?

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
I mean, they're aware of the problem and they were fixing them.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
So, what more do you want them to do?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Fucking give you a blowjob or something?

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
I mean, seriously, just this guy...

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
You're a little bit feisty tonight.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
He needs to...

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Go ahead with your class action lawsuit.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Who leveled your feathers before the show tonight?

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
No, no, no.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Go ahead with your class action lawsuit.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Just because you have a lawsuit doesn't mean you're going to win.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
I hope you waste all the money in the world and I hope your 360 doesn't work afterwards.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
So, fuck you.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Macman in our chat says it's about time someone sued Microsoft.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Rise, my iMac.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Rise from your grave.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Get it?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Altered Beast reference?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Get it?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Altered Beast.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
That's a good game.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
I know.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Altered Beast.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
I said I won't buy it on Virtual Console.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Not for eight bucks.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Not when it's not the arcade version.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
Anyways, so, more craziness, 360 related, of course, this week.

17:35.000 --> 17:43.000
On Monday, during Monday Night Football, the first kind of teaser trailer for Halo 3 was

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
aired on TV in the course.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
Everybody and their brother basically took this and decided, hey, you know what, be fun.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
Let's change the music on it, just like we did with the Mad World ad for Heroes of War.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
You know, I thought it was a pretty cool trailer.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I mean, I like it.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
It's just like it has the same impact as the first one, I think.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
The first teaser during E3.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I'm really psyched for the game.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
Hopefully, we'll hear something from the beta, you know, despite the fact that there's

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
probably going to be, you know, tight lipped.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I swear I could not sign up for the beta.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I tried like 50 times and I couldn't get in on it.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Stupid sight.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
It was funny because they had the link up for the beta before the beta thing even launched,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
so I signed up then.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Yeah, so did I.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I didn't have to worry about the feature.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Well, la di da di, you both.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
But, some of us have to actually work at work and can't refresh constantly.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
This is not me on the site.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
I didn't hit refresh constantly.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
I read it in a blog and then I went and signed up.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
I also signed up for Shadowrun, so hopefully I get in on one of those.

18:45.000 --> 18:51.000
Because, to be honest, the last one I played was Test Drive Unlimited and, you know,

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
just the PlayStation 2 version is not as good as the 360 one.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
But, yeah, Halo 3 looks cool.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
I mean, we know it's going to be pretty good.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
So, just have to wait until they tease us with more shit.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
Of course, many folks in our chat room are talking about how they signed up for the beta.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
Jeremy Todd 1 says, I signed up for the beta, but still, there's like.9% of actually getting

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
into the beta.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Too many Halo fanboys.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
But, here's the thing, though.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
There's going to be more ways to get into the beta as the weeks go along.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
This is straight from my EA rep because we were like, once we saw that the beta...

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
The fuck does EA know about Halo, though?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Not EA.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I'm sorry.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Microsoft.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
My Microsoft rep.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Good job.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Good job, Loki.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Sorry.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Whatever.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
He's human, folks.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
I was looking at something that said EA and, you know, it's a slip.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Anyways, yeah, my Microsoft rep because we were like, hey, how can you get us into this

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
beta?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Come on.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Pull some strings.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
And, he's like, no.

19:49.000 --> 19:57.680
I want to play some pimps at sea, as it was called when folks were spotting them on Xbox

19:57.680 --> 20:00.680
Live this week, testing Halo 3.

20:00.680 --> 20:04.280
You really think we're going to have to wait all the way to next Thanksgiving for this

20:04.280 --> 20:05.280
game?

20:05.280 --> 20:09.000
I mean, jeez, they're advertising it like it's coming out tomorrow, it seems like, with

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
all this hype.

20:10.000 --> 20:17.640
I don't think we'll have to wait, and to be honest, I really...

20:17.640 --> 20:21.880
They're pretty much, you know, if they're going in the beta, I mean, the game's almost

20:21.880 --> 20:22.880
done then.

20:22.880 --> 20:27.160
I mean, they wouldn't be going in the beta if it was, you know, being put out in November.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.120
I mean, that's a perfect example right there.

20:29.120 --> 20:33.240
The beta test is in the spring because it's a beta test.

20:33.240 --> 20:35.960
It means the game's right about to come out.

20:35.960 --> 20:43.640
So, you know, I think it's definitely going to be hitting the, probably the stores around

20:43.640 --> 20:44.640
the end of March.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.640
Oh, I see.

20:45.640 --> 20:46.640
Mid-March.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.560
There's going to be some interesting stuff, though, because this, you know, beta sign-up

20:49.560 --> 20:54.240
was mainly for the US and North America type stuff.

20:54.240 --> 20:59.560
However, if you're in the UK, there's going to be a few ways you can get signed up, and

20:59.560 --> 21:04.340
there's actually quite a list of websites, depending on which country you're in, that

21:04.340 --> 21:05.580
you can sign up.

21:05.580 --> 21:08.720
They have limited slots for the beta available.

21:08.720 --> 21:22.480
Such sites, for example, the UK Rewired Mine, 360 Monster, BritXBox, msxboxworld.com, totally360.com,

21:22.480 --> 21:28.720
and of course, Germany's got a bunch of different sites, well, PlanetXBox, et cetera.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.120
So, you know, definitely take a look out there.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.720
There's tons of links.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.800
I know IGN ran a story with some of this stuff.

21:36.800 --> 21:41.600
So, if you're looking to get signed up and you don't live in the United States, then

21:41.600 --> 21:46.880
definitely check these out, because they haven't finished their beta sign-ups yet.

21:46.880 --> 21:52.480
You know, I suck at Halo, like I'm really, really bad at Halo, but I think the game is

21:52.480 --> 21:57.400
presented just beautifully, and you know, I'm getting suckered into this marketing campaign

21:57.400 --> 21:58.640
stuff a little bit.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.080
My hype meter's going up a little bit.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.080
I'm excited for this.

22:01.080 --> 22:06.200
I've played Halo 2 maybe twice in my life.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.680
When are you going to get Halo 3?

22:07.680 --> 22:08.680
I'll get Halo 3.

22:08.680 --> 22:09.680
Sucker.

22:09.680 --> 22:10.680
Why?

22:10.680 --> 22:11.680
It's a first-person shooter.

22:11.680 --> 22:12.680
It looks fun.

22:12.680 --> 22:13.680
It'll be fun.

22:13.680 --> 22:14.680
I'm sure it'll be good.

22:14.680 --> 22:15.680
It's a good multiplayer game.

22:15.680 --> 22:16.680
It's like Call of Duty 3.

22:16.680 --> 22:19.960
I've been playing Call of Duty 3, and that's okay.

22:19.960 --> 22:22.960
I mean, there's a few things that...

22:22.960 --> 22:27.800
I don't understand why they're making sequels, why they don't just improve on the original

22:27.800 --> 22:28.800
one.

22:28.800 --> 22:32.880
They always have to take content out, and it's really obvious stuff that should be in

22:32.880 --> 22:37.040
there, like I don't know, a radar or something when the gunfire is going off.

22:37.040 --> 22:41.240
You can see where the person is on the map, flash where they're at.

22:41.240 --> 22:46.280
That was perfect for Call of Duty 2, so you had to be quiet, but now you can just fire

22:46.280 --> 22:48.520
away and no one knows where the hell you are.

22:48.520 --> 22:51.120
I don't know.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.520
I haven't really played that series.

22:52.520 --> 22:53.520
Couldn't tell you.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.520
Couldn't tell you.

22:54.520 --> 22:58.760
Well, you know, Loki messed up there and was talking about EA, but maybe it was a bit of

22:58.760 --> 23:04.040
a slip because the next story is about EA, and that's right.

23:04.040 --> 23:08.440
You know how EA is famous for putting out things on Marketplace that basically just

23:08.440 --> 23:11.520
unlocks things you could get in the game anyway.

23:11.520 --> 23:19.680
Well, Need for Speed Carbon has gotten their list on Xbox Live now of some various custom

23:19.680 --> 23:26.040
car packages, an aftermarket hoods bundle and spoilers bundle and roof scoops and a

23:26.040 --> 23:31.600
87 Toyota Corolla that you can now purchase for various amounts of points, and this is

23:31.600 --> 23:34.560
just all crap that you can basically unlock in the game if you're patient, at least most

23:34.560 --> 23:36.040
of this I believe.

23:36.040 --> 23:40.760
I think some of the cars are exclusive to that.

23:40.760 --> 23:45.560
I think maybe the 87 Corolla, but most of that other stuff you can get in the game if

23:45.560 --> 23:46.560
you're just patient.

23:46.560 --> 23:47.560
Exactly.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.560
So, whatever.

23:48.560 --> 23:54.080
Well, other news about EA, and this was kind of cool because I like Burnout.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.180
Burnout's awesome.

23:55.180 --> 24:01.700
They're doing a special Burnout game for the PS2 and PlayStation Portable, Burnout Dominator,

24:01.700 --> 24:05.520
and from what I've gathered from the press release so far is it's going to be similar

24:05.520 --> 24:08.800
to the Burnout Legends game on the PSP.

24:08.800 --> 24:14.520
Kind of a culmination of the entire series so far, featuring all the tracks from one

24:14.520 --> 24:23.280
all the way through three and probably also Burnout 4 or Revenge.

24:23.280 --> 24:28.120
Looks cool, kind of a good way to end the series on the PlayStation 2.

24:28.120 --> 24:31.680
Maybe there might be another PSP version, assuming this one does okay.

24:31.680 --> 24:37.680
But Burnout 5 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and the 360, so that will be

24:37.680 --> 24:39.080
kind of fun to look forward to.

24:39.080 --> 24:42.480
Hopefully they have one for the Wii because that would be kind of cool too.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.480
Burnout on the Wii?

24:43.480 --> 24:44.480
I don't know.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.480
They have Excite Truck on the Wii.

24:45.480 --> 24:46.480
Yeah, I guess.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.480
I don't know.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.480
It would be a little weird.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.520
I actually, one game, I don't think I mentioned this during my gaming week, but I have been

24:50.520 --> 24:53.880
playing Burnout on the 360 quite a bit this week for no particular reason.

24:53.880 --> 24:59.040
I just wanted to play more Burnout and have custom soundtracks and all that fun stuff.

24:59.040 --> 25:04.680
And I also really suck at Burnout, so I don't just suck at Halo, I suck at Burnout too.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.360
Good times.

25:06.360 --> 25:09.560
I will definitely check out the next Burnout on 360 though.

25:09.560 --> 25:12.140
It will be fun.

25:12.140 --> 25:16.480
Something else I might have to check out at some point, there's a new magazine that is

25:16.480 --> 25:17.560
being made.

25:17.560 --> 25:20.960
It's called, get this, Wii 60 Magazine.

25:20.960 --> 25:26.380
Somebody took this whole concept about getting a Wii and getting a 360 and they have decided

25:26.380 --> 25:31.760
to run with it and they're creating a magazine called Wii 60.

25:31.760 --> 25:35.800
It's being called an underground movement birthed by the most noble of players during

25:35.800 --> 25:38.280
the E3 2006 conference.

25:38.280 --> 25:43.000
They're calling it the unadulterated voice of truth in this generation of gaming.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.920
These men of valor are some of the most important people in the video game industry and their

25:46.920 --> 25:50.520
voice must be heard not just from coast to coast but from pole to pole.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.400
What the, who writes this crap?

25:52.400 --> 25:56.120
Probably the same people that are going to be writing this magazine and to be honest

25:56.120 --> 25:59.520
it's probably going to suck.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.360
These people really love themselves.

26:01.360 --> 26:08.040
Well anyway you can check out www.Wii60.com to get more information on the magazine if

26:08.040 --> 26:11.600
you are curious about this and want to check it out.

26:11.600 --> 26:17.480
Now what's interesting is that there is a Wii60.com but the link here leads to Wii60.tv

26:17.480 --> 26:18.800
so I'm not sure what that's all about.

26:18.800 --> 26:19.800
Maybe there's two sites.

26:19.800 --> 26:20.800
Not sure.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.080
Maybe you should type it in and look.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.080
I'm looking.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.080
I'm looking.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.320
No it looks like Wii60.tv looks like the real site.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.320
Oh get this.

26:29.320 --> 26:38.120
The publisher's name is Martin Lokey Alessi and his email address is lokey at Wii60.tv.

26:38.120 --> 26:45.040
Here's another magazine that will be stealing from you Lokey.

26:45.040 --> 26:50.760
Blaze in our chat room says, hi I write for the magazine Wii60 and I fucking rule heart.

26:50.760 --> 26:53.400
James Patrick calls this the hate on Sony magazine.

26:53.400 --> 26:59.160
Those comments from me come from our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

26:59.160 --> 27:05.440
Anyways speaking of the Wii, Sony and Microsoft may have a Wii dilemma.

27:05.440 --> 27:08.120
Haha I get it.

27:08.120 --> 27:17.100
If you know basically this what Jack Uldrich from Motley Fool if what he says is correct.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.000
Basically it makes sense.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.540
This is kind of what they're targeting towards.

27:21.540 --> 27:26.380
Since the Wii is kind of aiming at that you know casual gamer, non-gamer, people that

27:26.380 --> 27:31.760
haven't picked up a video game system yet market, they may be able to actually grow

27:31.760 --> 27:37.520
the games market and basically instead of just trying to target the same people that

27:37.520 --> 27:43.040
have you know say a Playstation 2 or Xbox or GameCube, they can actually get a bunch

27:43.040 --> 27:49.480
of new gamers with the Wii and if that's the case, the 360 and the Playstation 3 might

27:49.480 --> 27:53.880
not be able to have the same poll with their systems because they're kind of too I guess

27:53.880 --> 28:00.160
hardcore and probably more expensive which case they could actually end up you know coming

28:00.160 --> 28:04.800
ahead of everybody else because that was also the same thing before during E3 where the

28:04.800 --> 28:06.360
Wii was going to be everyone's second system.

28:06.360 --> 28:09.900
Well if it's everyone's second system then of course it's going to be the system that's

28:09.900 --> 28:10.900
sold the most.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.240
I don't know.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.720
I think it's interesting.

28:13.720 --> 28:14.720
It makes sense.

28:14.720 --> 28:19.480
Uldrich is basically quoted as saying unfortunately because most of the time and energy for the

28:19.480 --> 28:23.920
past year has been focused on providing more horsepower and fancier graphics for existing

28:23.920 --> 28:28.960
customers the hardcore gamers demand the upgrades found in the Playstation 3.

28:28.960 --> 28:33.680
Sony has not busied themselves in developing products that appeal to non-gamers.

28:33.680 --> 28:38.160
As a result, it appears that they are now behind the curve in development of simpler

28:38.160 --> 28:42.720
to use and less expensive technologies like the Wii and it makes sense.

28:42.720 --> 28:47.480
I mean the Playstation 3 is that's a lot of money to drop on a system that you might not

28:47.480 --> 28:53.040
be sure you know about and whereas the Wii I think it's pretty much pick up and go type

28:53.040 --> 28:57.760
of thing especially since it comes with its own new game already.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.160
Hmm.

28:59.160 --> 29:02.560
Interesting I mean so you kind of agree with what's going on here with this story?

29:02.560 --> 29:09.040
I think so but then again the 360 I think you know with Sony though I don't rule out

29:09.040 --> 29:12.080
that they're not going to try to copy more stuff that the Wii is doing.

29:12.080 --> 29:18.200
I mean I think there is already some patents registered for more devices like the Wiimote.

29:18.200 --> 29:23.560
I wouldn't be surprised if they try to copy everything that you know the Wii is doing.

29:23.560 --> 29:26.360
Even if they did copy it though do you think it would work?

29:26.360 --> 29:32.400
I don't think so because even still so you already have some games that appeal to a casual

29:32.400 --> 29:33.400
gamer.

29:33.400 --> 29:37.600
Well a casual gamer is not going to drop $600 for your system.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.600
That's true.

29:38.600 --> 29:42.000
Also I kind of think about you know I don't know I think about the Wii and I think about

29:42.000 --> 29:48.880
all those real big brand names that Nintendo has and big franchises like Metroid and Smash

29:48.880 --> 29:54.120
Brothers and Mario and Zelda and you know you get my point but then on Sony I think

29:54.120 --> 30:00.000
about franchises and I don't know they don't have that same I can't picture them in that

30:00.000 --> 30:04.660
well there's not a lot of franchises in Sony that Sony really owns I mean they're all third

30:04.660 --> 30:06.080
party franchises really.

30:06.080 --> 30:10.160
That's the thing is when you think about Nintendo you think okay Mario, Zelda, and you know

30:10.160 --> 30:17.120
Metroid when you think about Microsoft and 360 you think Halo and well that's pretty

30:17.120 --> 30:23.480
much it Halo but still when you think of Sony you kind of have trouble thinking of an actual

30:23.480 --> 30:28.000
franchise you know that's exclusive to them maybe you know Gran Turismo and God of War

30:28.000 --> 30:34.040
but they don't really have any like mascots or any you know games that really people buy

30:34.040 --> 30:35.040
the system for.

30:35.040 --> 30:39.800
I mean I guess in the middle of your solid four but I mean the air talking now that's

30:39.800 --> 30:46.040
going to be on both systems so really they're just Final Fantasy 13 question mark?

30:46.040 --> 30:51.000
You know if let me put it this way if Final Fantasy 13 for the Playstation 3 okay if it

30:51.000 --> 30:58.280
ends up that the Xbox 360 is sold tens of millions more systems than say the Playstation

30:58.280 --> 31:02.320
3 at the time the game is coming out I will bet you anything that they will be putting

31:02.320 --> 31:09.120
out on the Xbox 360 as well as the Playstation 3 if not only on the Xbox 360.

31:09.120 --> 31:13.080
Footy Monster in our chat room responded to something I said earlier saying Sky but on

31:13.080 --> 31:16.160
the other hand Nintendo has no third party so far.

31:16.160 --> 31:21.200
Well yes and no I mean the third party they don't have any like really huge third party

31:21.200 --> 31:26.160
franchises the way that maybe some of the other consoles do but third parties do seem

31:26.160 --> 31:31.000
to be sort of rallying around the Wii a little bit I mean they want to put out some of their

31:31.000 --> 31:35.160
franchises on there like and it has gotten support at least at their launch I mean Red

31:35.160 --> 31:38.720
Steel was a big title even though it was a critical hit and miss.

31:38.720 --> 31:43.200
Trauma Center was a great game even though it wasn't really widely picked up on but it

31:43.200 --> 31:48.160
was a little more critically aware so Elibits is looking to be a big title that's made by

31:48.160 --> 31:55.760
Konami so you know I think some of the mistakes made with GameCube in regards to third party

31:55.760 --> 32:01.760
are definitely already on their way to being remedied with the Wii.

32:01.760 --> 32:05.000
The more Wii's that get out there the more third parties that will want to develop for

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
it.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.720
And here's the other thing too I mean Squaresoft I mean I know that they're really dedicated

32:08.720 --> 32:13.880
to Sony but I mean at some point they're going to have to understand okay this system you

32:13.880 --> 32:18.520
know let's say a year from now when Final Fantasy 13 is coming out say that they're

32:18.520 --> 32:23.160
not able to sell as many systems as they would have liked for the PlayStation 3 so they're

32:23.160 --> 32:26.720
behind by say 10 million systems.

32:26.720 --> 32:31.280
Why would I develop for a system that has less units out there less of a chance for

32:31.280 --> 32:35.400
me to make my money back when there's a system that's cheaper to develop for and has a lot

32:35.400 --> 32:41.240
more systems out there and is capable of doing comparable graphics?

32:41.240 --> 32:46.440
I don't understand why that would be pure idiocy to just develop for the one system

32:46.440 --> 32:53.120
that's why you have companies like you know Koei developing Fatal Inertia and their Blade

32:53.120 --> 32:57.940
Storm game for both systems now because to be honest they're not going to make their

32:57.940 --> 33:02.360
money back if they just put it out on the PlayStation 3 and that's a big problem for

33:02.360 --> 33:03.360
Sony.

33:03.360 --> 33:07.120
They've got to figure out how to get these systems sold first off getting the systems

33:07.120 --> 33:12.080
out there and give people a reason to buy this system because right now it's just seeing

33:12.080 --> 33:15.640
that it has a blu-ray player well you know what a lot of people say who gives a shit

33:15.640 --> 33:19.880
about blu-ray player I don't care right now because I'm not going to go replace my entire

33:19.880 --> 33:22.760
DVD library.

33:22.760 --> 33:26.200
Interesting thoughts if you agree or disagree send us an email because we'll get to the

33:26.200 --> 33:31.140
emails a little later in the program mailbag at orangesloungeradio.com meanwhile we got

33:31.140 --> 33:36.760
to keep going through the news and speaking of Nintendo Wii very interesting I don't know

33:36.760 --> 33:40.900
if this would be news or rumor the thing is that it's coming from a foreign website and

33:40.900 --> 33:44.640
not to discount what foreign websites might be saying but you know we kind of get a little

33:44.640 --> 33:48.760
bit until we see like a you know press release from Nintendo of America we're not really

33:48.760 --> 33:54.820
sure what to think of this but according to this website cyamite.de they were reporting

33:54.820 --> 33:58.840
that you're going to be able to download Wii game demos you can either store the demos

33:58.840 --> 34:04.480
in your flash ram on the console or to an external SD card now what's kind of interesting

34:04.480 --> 34:09.120
about this is that well the Wii doesn't have exactly that much internal memory I mean it's

34:09.120 --> 34:12.960
got what about 512 megs yep and by the time you start downloading all this other stuff

34:12.960 --> 34:16.600
that Nintendo's planning to put out like the internet channel you know things of that nature

34:16.600 --> 34:19.680
that stuff's going to start to fill up especially with some of the other big virtual console

34:19.680 --> 34:24.940
releases so you know where are these demos going to go I guess there's the SD card but

34:24.940 --> 34:30.180
still it seems a little not quite I don't know well one thing to keep reading and they're

34:30.180 --> 34:37.200
saying that there's support for USB hard drives and USB devices coming but you have to have

34:37.200 --> 34:42.380
the latest update to be able to store stuff to it the only thing is though is this update

34:42.380 --> 34:47.160
I think people are talking about isn't out yet and from what the rumors I've been reading

34:47.160 --> 34:53.240
are that an update with the internet channel is going to support USB hard drives as well

34:53.240 --> 34:56.960
if that's the case then they can store them to that and I'm sure you'll see a Nintendo

34:56.960 --> 35:03.320
hard drive of some sort that'll plug in via the USB ports on there I don't know that looks

35:03.320 --> 35:08.240
sounds like a little after the fact I mean I really wish they would have put more storage

35:08.240 --> 35:12.840
in the system but that's a little bit disappointing I would have thought they would have put more

35:12.840 --> 35:16.200
storage inside the actual system itself but I mean I guess you know they want to keep

35:16.200 --> 35:20.600
it cheap so it makes sense okay that's fine if you want to keep it cheap fine build a

35:20.600 --> 35:25.960
port for a hard drive then well it's not what the SD card slots for really cuz you can fit

35:25.960 --> 35:31.200
quite a bit on those little cards I mean and they were good enough to that you can put

35:31.200 --> 35:35.720
any SD card in there in fact you know most people are saying screw these official Nintendo

35:35.720 --> 35:41.080
SD cards I'm gonna go buy I'm gonna go buy the cheaper ones and use those I've been using

35:41.080 --> 35:45.680
the card for my camera phone to send pictures if I was digging through the my phone the

35:45.680 --> 35:50.780
other day and I saw a picture of you at E3 outpost it's really funny cuz you're like

35:50.780 --> 35:55.200
leaning over the couch and going rawr but you can see Bobby Blackwolf in the background

35:55.200 --> 35:59.800
like doing some busy work so I send it to Bobby and I drew like a big arrow in the in

35:59.800 --> 36:05.440
the paint channel I put who dat or something like that so I've been having fun with the

36:05.440 --> 36:11.640
camera phone converter thing SD card and I put I put Zelda on it just for fun even though

36:11.640 --> 36:17.800
I know I can't play it on other Wii's just for fun I'm gonna say I got Zelda in my pocket

36:17.800 --> 36:23.120
cuz I'm lame like that anyways so there is another story that came out very vague this

36:23.120 --> 36:29.400
week was coming from a magazine called games TM and oh wait I gotta say that this is a

36:29.400 --> 36:34.520
very good point James Patrick is saying 360 has no hard drive in its core bundle true

36:34.520 --> 36:40.760
that's a good point but they had a port for one though true okay you got that and it does

36:40.760 --> 36:45.680
have some internal memory but not that you can save games on really it's just for you

36:45.680 --> 36:53.840
know updates and things like that yeah anyways so yeah there is a very vague comment from

36:53.840 --> 37:02.240
the magazine says something big coming to Wii Virtual Console and how big is it well

37:02.240 --> 37:06.640
it doesn't say what hell am I reporting is this news I know what what the fuck kind of

37:06.640 --> 37:16.960
news there is something something big is on its way well you know better be some damn

37:16.960 --> 37:22.080
you know Reggie fees amaze about to make a big duty that you can download on your virtual

37:22.080 --> 37:28.960
console this Monday I want my fucking Nintendo games TurboGrafx-16 is great and all but uh

37:28.960 --> 37:35.320
give me more Nintendo games you know what the hell where's my kid Icarus where's my

37:35.320 --> 37:42.320
guardian legend where's my super Castlevania 4 which they have overseas where's my link

37:42.320 --> 37:47.280
to the past which they have overseas damn you people where's my Super Mario Brothers

37:47.280 --> 37:56.520
Super Mario World Mario Kart Mario Kart 64 damn you Reggie anyways well you know this

37:56.520 --> 38:00.960
might be enough to sway you back into a like in the TurboGrafx-16 downloads there are some

38:00.960 --> 38:07.580
rumors abounding that Alien Crush which was a pretty badass TurboGrafx-16 game and Dungeon

38:07.580 --> 38:12.040
Explorer on their way to the Wii's Virtual Console now the story here is kind of vague

38:12.040 --> 38:16.400
you're not sure if they mean it's coming out this week or that it's coming out in the future

38:16.400 --> 38:21.660
so I'm thinking it means it's coming out soon so whether that means this week or the future

38:21.660 --> 38:27.580
I mean we just did kind of get a big clump of TurboGrafx-16 games supposed to be every

38:27.580 --> 38:31.760
Monday yeah but but do we have to be getting TurboGrafx and Genesis every Monday I mean

38:31.760 --> 38:36.960
don't get me wrong there's some good games there but there's things I want more on the

38:36.960 --> 38:42.320
NES and if somebody in chat was saying Gunstar Heroes is rumored for this Monday I imagine

38:42.320 --> 38:46.600
the four games we're gonna get probably are just gonna be games that are available elsewhere

38:46.600 --> 38:51.760
but who knows which ones I tried using my credit card to put more points on my Virtual

38:51.760 --> 38:56.800
Console account and didn't work really mine works fine yeah mine it I guess their network

38:56.800 --> 39:01.620
was having trouble or something but you know plenty of money on there definitely not broke

39:01.620 --> 39:08.080
or anything so I don't know stupid stupid virtual console and of course now everybody

39:08.080 --> 39:12.020
in the chat room is talking about I want I want I want I want I want let's see we've

39:12.020 --> 39:19.320
got act deft I want my Super Mario RPG yeah monster once zombies ate my neighbors shadow

39:19.320 --> 39:24.520
Charlie's okay with more Genesis as long as the streets of rage and shadow next-gen agrees

39:24.520 --> 39:28.920
the mean link to the past on Virtual Console shadow next-gen also want Super Metroid on

39:28.920 --> 39:34.720
VC hell yeah Dark Knight once pilot wings those are all good stuff property once Super

39:34.720 --> 39:40.720
C that was a pretty cool game Super C I think is on game tap I think as well with the Contra

39:40.720 --> 39:44.720
so you can always check it out there I I want the the Super Nintendo Contra though that

39:44.720 --> 39:48.560
wasn't called Super C was it was something else Super Contra right I want that one that

39:48.560 --> 39:53.040
was pretty cool because they had like the mode seven levels those are rad yeah anyways

39:53.040 --> 40:01.920
so much like you know immersion did with the Sony PlayStation 2 dual shock controller another

40:01.920 --> 40:06.800
company has claimed that they want to take Nintendo the court over the Wii remote because

40:06.800 --> 40:13.640
they say they have a patent for it and very similar kind of lawsuit company called interlink

40:13.640 --> 40:18.920
who has revealed that they have a device that's very similar to the Wii remote that they've

40:18.920 --> 40:23.240
patented my guess they probably haven't created said device but you know they have a patent

40:23.240 --> 40:29.160
for it anyways and basically you know going to try to get some money out of Nintendo you

40:29.160 --> 40:36.440
know different companies same song it sounds like but gotta hate hate when these companies

40:36.440 --> 40:41.980
do this stuff because they totally create patents for stuff that they don't imagine

40:41.980 --> 40:47.440
on that they're not going to even use just the because they probably hear that some companies

40:47.440 --> 40:53.040
make it something similar well what if this did legitimately already exist well it looks

40:53.040 --> 40:58.000
like crap anyways it looks like it to be honest looking at this right now it it looks like

40:58.000 --> 41:05.880
a TV remote it that's all it looks like it it looks like it has an infrared emitter inside

41:05.880 --> 41:14.000
the actual device you know controller I guess and then there is a receiver that you know

41:14.000 --> 41:18.920
would be an infrared receiver so if anything I would say that the people that created like

41:18.920 --> 41:26.360
a TV remote would be able to sue over the Wii remote because I don't know this I think

41:26.360 --> 41:31.400
there's enough different with the two devices that they probably won't well now it says

41:31.400 --> 41:35.520
here that in the come I'm reading through the complaint here and this patent was filed

41:35.520 --> 41:39.760
by the other company on February 1st 2005 long before anyone knew anything about the

41:39.760 --> 41:48.520
Wii so true though okay so it was filed 2005 doesn't mean though that they weren't you

41:48.520 --> 41:54.400
know that I'd want to see when the patent was filed for the Wii remote because apparently

41:54.400 --> 42:02.360
the Wii has been in production for a long time I don't know oh I see it's it's you use

42:02.360 --> 42:05.920
it in operating the computer from far away they use it between it's they made it for

42:05.920 --> 42:10.720
the computer it's probably to it's like one of our point yeah it's one of the yeah it's

42:10.720 --> 42:13.840
one of those things I'll let you run like the PowerPoint shows from a room from I have

42:13.840 --> 42:19.060
I want to work that's just saying like that a TV remote though basically I mean that's

42:19.060 --> 42:26.240
basically what it is interesting I mean isn't that what a TV remote is I mean or D like

42:26.240 --> 42:30.480
a DVD remote for example you know that would be basically what it is because you know I

42:30.480 --> 42:38.360
use the PlayStation 2 DVD remote to navigate menus and stuff it's very similar to this

42:38.360 --> 42:44.720
it uses IR as well I just think that they're too different I mean this is very similar

42:44.720 --> 42:50.800
to say a TV remote than it is you know the Wii remote Raven's Dolphin says the Wii trigger

42:50.800 --> 42:59.140
goes through Bluetooth not infrared they will lose exactly hmm well you know these lawsuits

42:59.140 --> 43:03.200
that seemingly come out of nowhere when something gets popular they make us angsty and we get

43:03.200 --> 43:08.000
really angry about this stuff because we don't want anyone taking away our we so that means

43:08.000 --> 43:18.920
it's about time for the F use of the week

43:18.920 --> 43:23.920
since dark soccer is not here tonight Loki you're gonna have to start us off if you to

43:23.920 --> 43:33.600
dark soccer for not being here yeah if you to the ferret I want to say f you to rpm racing

43:33.600 --> 43:39.200
because they're number 11 car had fucked up traction on it so I kept slamming into the

43:39.200 --> 43:47.920
wall and I actually had to get pitted one lap because they black flagged me fuck you

43:47.920 --> 43:58.760
to rob for the fact that you know pretty good music I like this let's see I would have to

43:58.760 --> 44:05.480
say gosh I don't have a lot to be angsty about today I would say an F you to the rain and

44:05.480 --> 44:09.360
it being so cold out recently an F you to the fact that I'm spoiled by California weather

44:09.360 --> 44:14.600
so what's what's cold right now probably isn't really cold to other people so if you to the

44:14.600 --> 44:21.280
weather lately has been kind of crappy that's it left the room because he has a bad headache

44:21.280 --> 44:26.000
I guess DER gave him a headache so maybe it's not here to put in his F you so F you to headaches

44:26.000 --> 44:36.480
and Advil it doesn't work anyhow let's go into our next story which is about the spike

44:36.480 --> 44:44.520
TV VGA's if I'm not mistaking did you these have an air jet have they I think they're

44:44.520 --> 44:57.360
going to air it taped on Friday but it's going to air on what the 13th probably spoiler alert

44:57.360 --> 45:01.600
we're going to ruin it for you right now here's who won at the spike TV game of the year was

45:01.600 --> 45:08.440

45:49.600 --> 45:53.600
Johnny Depp to show up at the award show you know this is true faster anyway we actually

45:53.600 --> 45:58.120
have someone on the line with us who actually attended the event and is going to tell us

45:58.120 --> 46:02.200
a little bit more about what happened on the inside it's Orange Lounge Radio's very own

DJ Tyrant from STFU you there DJ Tyrant yeah how's it going guys good how are you doing

46:08.440 --> 46:14.120
I'm doing good my voice is a little shot from yelling at the awards but what happened tell

46:14.120 --> 46:20.400
us about like how you got into the VGAs and how it all went down I got an email from Xfire

46:20.400 --> 46:25.680
and they had a thousand tickets to give out so I just showed up and they they gave them

46:25.680 --> 46:31.640
to me right on wow so you just went right in and got to see all this stuff were there

46:31.640 --> 46:37.320
a lot of celebrities there yeah there were just a ton of celebrities I got to meet the

46:37.320 --> 46:43.160
guys who do Mega64.com it was really cool you know I met them at an E3 a couple years

46:43.160 --> 46:47.080
ago and they seemed really offended I didn't know who they were I mean I know who they

46:47.080 --> 46:50.820
are now but at the time they seemed really offended that I didn't know who they were

46:50.820 --> 46:55.600
I'm like sorry but somebody explained it to me afterwards I'm like oh that Tetris video

46:55.600 --> 47:01.120
yeah that's that's kind of funny so anyway were they cool to you they seemed pretty cool

47:01.120 --> 47:06.380
yeah they were they were pretty pretty nice to me how about how about any A-list celebrities

47:06.380 --> 47:11.800
because you know Mega64 with all due respect it's kind of like D, E-list, internet celebrities

47:11.800 --> 47:16.440
where do internet celebrities go on the E-list somewhere where did you meet did you meet

47:16.440 --> 47:24.040
Samuel L. Jackson or Tom Cruise I don't know the A-list celebrities I'm sorry to hear that

47:24.040 --> 47:28.720
so why is your voice so hoarse were you screaming and yelling and cheering at all these people

47:28.720 --> 47:35.240
yes I was I was more booing at them than than anything so you were booing all the celebrities

47:35.240 --> 47:42.200
as they came out on stage yeah as Ravenstaufen1 says in chat I did boo 50 Cent when he came

47:42.200 --> 47:49.000
to present an award what'd you say to 50 Cent I said your game sucks well I mean it does

47:49.000 --> 47:54.600
I mean did did did anybody yell back or could people actually hear you or was it the place

47:54.600 --> 48:00.280
so huge they couldn't really hear you I I think some people know the first floor heard

48:00.280 --> 48:07.700
me and they they laughed so so you you were the heckler guy huh yes I was I'm reading

48:07.700 --> 48:12.360
a little bit of back and forth that's going on on destructoid.com because you made a comment

48:12.360 --> 48:15.680
you were talking about in their in their comments you're talking about you know how you yelled

48:15.680 --> 48:22.240
at 50 Cent your game sucks and his game didn't suck let's see DJ Tyrant wrote booing yellow

48:22.240 --> 48:29.960
cards saying get off the stage asshole and yelled at Sarah Silverman you're not funny

48:29.960 --> 48:33.680
see I think this stuff is kind of funny but then somebody replied to you dude you were

48:33.680 --> 48:38.460
a total ass I sat three rows behind you you were wearing a blue X-Fire shirt you were

48:38.460 --> 48:45.000
a huge asshole throughout the show comments were you a big asshole throughout the show

48:45.000 --> 48:52.480
yes I was I'll admit that I don't see how anyone can take it seriously though the show

48:52.480 --> 48:57.240
it's terrible you know what I think it's funny because you're right all these celebrities

48:57.240 --> 49:01.680
are just coming out how many of them do you think actually play games how much of 50 cents

49:01.680 --> 49:06.640
game do you think he actually played I think these celebrities just show up to these events

49:06.640 --> 49:09.400
because they know it's something they can add to their resume and say that they were

49:09.400 --> 49:18.200
on TV right yeah definitely although the guy who was Superman Superman Returns I can't

49:18.200 --> 49:25.400
think of his name Brandon Routh he's a he was obviously a big Warcraft fan when he introduced

49:25.400 --> 49:31.960
the World of Warcraft Burning Crusade video why did he come out there and go Leroy Jenkins

49:31.960 --> 49:38.640
he do that nobody he said he he had played Warcraft 2 and mentioned a lot about how he

49:38.640 --> 49:46.600
liked wizard so so you didn't see at least one gamer out there so you didn't boo him

49:46.600 --> 49:52.080
no okay so somebody if somebody earned their cred with DJ Tyrant then they didn't get booed

49:52.080 --> 49:57.160
all right yeah I cheered for Gears of War I haven't played it but they definitely deserve

49:57.160 --> 50:02.360
the respect it's a good game if you're into first-person shooters it's a good game all

50:02.360 --> 50:07.640
right well anything else you want to say about the award show watch it and see if you can

50:07.640 --> 50:12.440
hear me during it no they'll they'll they'll have muted you or bleeped you out that's that's

50:12.440 --> 50:16.360
why they don't air it live because they're too they're too chicken shit to air it live

50:16.360 --> 50:20.800
because these these celebrities egos would be damaged if heaven forbid they could pick

50:20.800 --> 50:28.640
up in the background some a-hole in the bleachers no offense going your game sucks so they're

50:28.640 --> 50:33.540
they're they're doing that post editing right now bleeping you out and probably blurring

50:33.540 --> 50:38.000
your seat they'll work hard what well I made them work hard there you go that's all that

50:38.000 --> 50:42.200
matters all right well yeah and black wolf in our chat room says the crowd noise will

50:42.200 --> 50:47.520
be faked the entire show most likely was there a lot of thunderous applause did they have

50:47.520 --> 50:54.000
the lights that say applause applause or did they bring a girl on stage they had a lot

50:54.000 --> 51:01.240
of seat fillers though a lot of seat fillers oh like the people they pay to go fill in

51:01.240 --> 51:05.400
the celebrity seats when they go to the bathroom yeah they were they were all in the front

51:05.400 --> 51:10.720
row it seemed like interesting huh all right well thank you for the insider perspective

51:10.720 --> 51:14.760
and hey try to go to some more awards so say hey if they do a G4ia this year you definitely

51:14.760 --> 51:18.840
have to get in there and do some heckling all right I'll see what I can do all right

51:18.840 --> 51:23.760

have a good one DJ Tyrant and we'll see you on Thursday for STFU all right bye later

51:43.560 --> 51:49.600
guys all right that was our very own DJ Tyrant giving us the the scoop on what went on at

51:49.600 --> 51:55.120
the video game awards and how he was a big jerk but you know what it's you know you can't

51:55.120 --> 51:58.880
take celebrities seriously like if Britney Spears had come out I would have yelled you

51:58.880 --> 52:02.800
know where's your panties you know because you know because of all the pictures recently

52:02.800 --> 52:11.160
anyway forget it anywho back to some news um you know I'm starting to think we should

52:11.160 --> 52:21.480
really curb from now on any stories that are from an analyst I mean seriously the rumors

52:21.480 --> 52:26.640
come back up again from an analyst saying that Apple is entering the console market

52:26.640 --> 52:33.440
and their take on it is basically we think that the video game market represents a distinct

52:33.440 --> 52:37.480
possibility for Apple especially considering that it recently announced that the availability

52:37.480 --> 52:44.440
of video games for its iPod through the iTunes store that's not a reason that's stupid that's

52:44.440 --> 52:49.280
like I don't get it every fucking week on this program for the past almost five years

52:49.280 --> 52:54.280
what do we sit here and do we sit here and analyze the game scene that's what we do and

52:54.280 --> 53:00.520
nobody's ever thrown money at us I don't get it these finance if I got a degree would they

53:00.520 --> 53:05.280
throw money at us in in whatever these people have degree in marketing analysis or whatever

53:05.280 --> 53:09.120
and they don't even have to be right they're like the goddamn weatherman of you know the

53:09.120 --> 53:15.200
fucking video game industry or whatever industry they're having to be reporting on oh I think

53:15.200 --> 53:21.660
that you know squirrels are gonna fly on my ass today and if it doesn't happen who cares

53:21.660 --> 53:26.600
because I'm an analyst and if I'm wrong well that's because the company's changed their

53:26.600 --> 53:31.120
mind I mean it doesn't matter here's what Apple is gonna create next they're gonna create

53:31.120 --> 53:36.120
their own line of sex toys you're gonna have the eye the Apple like I vibe or something

53:36.120 --> 53:42.800
like that I mean seriously that is my analyst take on this because people like having fun

53:42.800 --> 53:47.820
therefore they like being pleasured there you go you know have feel the bass through

53:47.820 --> 53:54.440
the I vibe FireBoma calls it the eye-braider eye-braider whatever you know seriously this

53:54.440 --> 53:59.880
is how ridiculous these stories are I for one I will not be putting talking about any

53:59.880 --> 54:04.880
analyst crap from now on okay do you think it's feasible though that Apple could do a

54:04.880 --> 54:09.800
console it's feasible that they could do a console I mean after all they're doing here's

54:09.800 --> 54:14.340
what I think they would do if anything their ITV supporting some casual games and that's

54:14.340 --> 54:19.220
about it I'd say I agree with that exactly I think that little you know much like video

54:19.220 --> 54:23.540
games consoles in this generation 360 and the PlayStation 3 have been a Trojan horse

54:23.540 --> 54:28.200
in the living room to do movies and TV and all that stuff I think Apple's gonna do that

54:28.200 --> 54:32.080
in reverse I think they're gonna have put this Trojan horse in as a movie device and

54:32.080 --> 54:37.120
then hey it'll play Zuma and Bejeweled too that's it that's it's not gonna be able to

54:37.120 --> 54:42.960
run much anything else and have you tried playing any of these games on the Apple iPod

54:42.960 --> 54:50.520
they suck so I mean seriously and you know I hate I hate to sound like the fucking Apple

54:50.520 --> 54:57.360
hater but the Apple I mean their line of computers not exactly the biggest gaming machines I

54:57.360 --> 55:02.600
don't think they know how to make gaming machines if they even really want I I you know I will

55:02.600 --> 55:09.340
admit I love my now I love my Mac I love my little Mac laptop it's it's great I consider

55:09.340 --> 55:13.760
myself bi when it comes to computers I like Apple sometimes I like you know PC's other

55:13.760 --> 55:19.480
days but I don't exactly when I think hey I'm gonna go play some games on the computer

55:19.480 --> 55:23.480
I don't exactly think about my Apple and there's nothing wrong with that I mean they could

55:23.480 --> 55:28.040
they could come out with a game console I just I don't I think it's too late in the

55:28.040 --> 55:33.920
game to come out with a new console right now and I think if they did it it would fail

55:33.920 --> 55:39.260
it would be like you know the Phantom or something like that the Pippin Black Wolf says

55:39.260 --> 55:45.240
apparently Tetris works really well on an iPod I I don't know I don't read but my iPod

55:45.240 --> 55:50.360
was the old ass black and white one and it broke so I'm hoping I get gift certificates

55:50.360 --> 55:55.120
this Christmas so I can get myself a new one but great then I can tell you blue ass though

55:55.120 --> 56:01.120
and that's the thing I mean so great one and at the end of the day it's bejeweled again

56:01.120 --> 56:06.400
I mean you know you can't take this seriously as a console unless there's new things to

56:06.400 --> 56:10.880
breathe life and anything you know what I will admit there was one time you know with

56:10.880 --> 56:15.400
Apple II that they had good games on there I mean you know you had some pretty good stuff

56:15.400 --> 56:26.280
on the Apple II but uh that that day is long past so well if you agree or you disagree

56:26.280 --> 56:30.380
again the mailbag is always open I'm trying to see if the chat rooms had anything to say

56:30.380 --> 56:34.080
about that but a lot of them are talking about trying to find those Britney Spears pictures

56:34.080 --> 56:39.320
again because I guess not everybody heard about it uh Loki why don't you take the next

56:39.320 --> 56:47.120
story too anyways so there was a game that's been announced here um which I mean I know

56:47.120 --> 56:52.640
that we're slightly a you know fan of the show uh Little Britain it's a show that's

56:52.640 --> 56:58.760
run in um the UK and also on BBC America yeah it's on BBC America um it's as very these

56:58.760 --> 57:04.000
do very well it's actually a parody of life in in Britain and they've got a bunch of different

57:04.000 --> 57:11.240
characters in there almost reminds me a little bit of like um kind of a modern take on say

57:11.240 --> 57:15.320
Monty Python everybody's got kids in the hall kind of yeah kind of kids with two people

57:15.320 --> 57:19.800
but um it yeah it's basically these two guys and it's hilarious it's a funny show well

57:19.800 --> 57:24.280
they're ba- making a brand new PlayStation 2 game based off of it and it's gonna be a

57:24.280 --> 57:30.440
collection of a bunch of mini games and it's just it's pretty funny looking from what I've

57:30.440 --> 57:33.440
seen so far what the hell are you gonna do with the Little Britain game don't be wrong

57:33.440 --> 57:37.800
I love the show but I can't really picture it as a game I mean are you gonna go around

57:37.800 --> 57:42.920
yelling I am the only game in the village no I that was funny that you mentioned that

57:42.920 --> 57:48.080
because actually they that was one of the the advertisements on the um the story they

57:48.080 --> 57:54.360
said you know I am the only game in the village no there's actually one though um one scene

57:54.360 --> 58:00.920
that I saw where you're riding around um trying to basically scare away the other gays that

58:00.920 --> 58:05.240
are in the village so that you can become the only game in the village you know just

58:05.240 --> 58:09.800
it's it's funny it's basically gonna be a collection of is there like is there gonna

58:09.800 --> 58:13.960
be like a music game for rap for the one girl that goes no but yeah but yeah but yeah but

58:13.960 --> 58:18.400
yeah and I you know her that tells all the the stories and stuff um basically anyways

58:18.400 --> 58:23.160
so the game is going to be like I said a collection of mini games presented in a format of an

58:23.160 --> 58:28.400
episode of the TV show and since players can enter um can get interactive with their favorite

58:28.400 --> 58:33.960
sketch show characters um in the series of eight mini games featuring Lou and Andy, Vicki

58:33.960 --> 58:43.360
Pollard, which you know no but yeah, uh Mr. Man, uh Emily and Florence, we got a lady!

58:43.360 --> 58:50.800
Majorie Dawes, um Daphne Thomas, uh Judy and Maggie and Letty and says each mini game plays

58:50.800 --> 58:54.800
like a sketch from the TV show to win the game players must progress through all the

58:54.800 --> 59:00.680
sketches to the end of the show or the credits will roll and um I don't know they have and

59:00.680 --> 59:02.120
that's coming out here in America too?

59:02.120 --> 59:06.560
I don't think so I think it's only in the UK and it's coming out on PC because you won't

59:06.560 --> 59:11.320
even be able to import that oh if it's PC you can PC PlayStation Portable you can get

59:11.320 --> 59:17.600
the PlayStation Portable version and um PlayStation 2 the PlayStation 2 and PC versions will be

59:17.600 --> 59:24.880
out January 22nd um and then May for the PSP version so we can import the you know the

59:24.880 --> 59:29.400
PSP one which might be fun is what's-his-name from Buffy in it and Anthony Stewart Head

59:29.400 --> 59:34.120
is that his name is he in it um I'm not sure but like they've got you know examples here

59:34.120 --> 59:38.480
oh here's a screenshot you know really great radio here but it's one of the mini games

59:38.480 --> 59:45.480
where you're smashing objects okay so I I don't know smashing frogs it looks like so

59:45.480 --> 59:54.800
I don't know it'll it'll be funny but interesting I'm sure it will be a good game anywho so

59:54.800 --> 01:00:01.120
um kind of moving on to a completely different topic here the Xbox 360 well we know that

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:08.680
it has an HD DVD drive well guess what it's gonna be people are using it to copy HD DVDs

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:15.800
to rip them to their PC because the HD DVD drive uses a USB port and a connection or

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:23.040
USB connection and can be um you know you can do the 1080p connection over component

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:29.760
cables you can actually use a video capture card to capture that and then dump it of course

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:36.880
to your hard drive for backup purposes only of course um of course you know the PlayStation

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:43.840
3 I think does the same thing with blu-ray I mean I don't know but later on um I suppose

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:48.320
when they're gonna require the HDMI cables that might be able to circumvent some of the

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:54.440
stuff but right now you can dump them via that I don't know oh I'm sure this has the

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.280
movie industry so excited whatever I mean it's their own fault that they couldn't figure

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:04.760
out a way they encrypted I still don't know what movies I really want on HD DVD I guess

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.160
I'm still waiting for the format to kind of take off that's the thing too like there was

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:13.320
a movie that I wanted but it's only on blu-ray interesting annoying you know that you're

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:19.800
gonna get a PlayStation 3 eventually right maybe I mean I don't know probably interesting

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.560
I got I got berated by the wife because she's like I thought you said you weren't gonna

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:28.800
get one of those I'm like what you just got excited about the you know motorstorm games

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:35.200
so all right well moving on to some ads that were about the PlayStation 3 they were run

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.840
by Circuit City and a joystick picked up some of these Circuit City ads running it under

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:44.400
the headline circuit city faults or stupid advertising you decide that's again on joystick

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:49.480
with a q.com which is interesting because they talk about some things from the catalog

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:54.860
and how it said PlayStation 3 ready to rumble it's hot and of course you know the joke would

01:01:54.860 --> 01:02:00.480
be that the PlayStation 3 does not in fact rumble and it has been overheating yeah and

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:06.520
so using the word hot is kind of funny as well and also I guess they show people playing

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:11.920
Xbox 360 Madden yet the controllers are off you know because you know Holly even when

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.920
even if you have a wired controller the Xbox guide button glows green with what you know

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:20.880
player you're in well of course in the picture you know obviously it's posed I mean they're

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:25.020
not really playing the game this isn't too hard to figure out but of course the anal

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:29.680
gamer will notice that the lights are off and so in fact the controllers are not plugged

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:36.680
in did you see the one of the we though on there no I did I missed that one there's a

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:44.400
picture with the Wii saying that the Wii can be played without a TV because it has a built

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:52.280
in projector into it what I'm serious I am wasn't that one of the old rumors about the

01:02:52.280 --> 01:03:00.480
was one of the old rumors but if that's how like somebody did not get the memo it's really

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:09.640
bad but I how does this like get through I mean seriously how does this get by without

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:16.120
people you know noticing this stuff so seriously because there's no gamers that work at circuit

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.040
cities proofreading department no here it is right here it's it's actually take a look

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:27.560
at the the story again it says the USB port lets you plug in the game system to a project

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:34.240
and play or to project and play on awesome eleven and a half foot widescreen and that

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:41.960
was for the Wii that might actually be for the 360 whatever it's still wrong it doesn't

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:49.160
matter the turned off Xbox 360 controllers playing Madden on a projection television

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:57.920
supposedly attached to the Xbox 360 by a USB cable interesting whatever it's just obviously

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:03.220
all that stuff supposed you know people read a little bit too much into that stuff well

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:10.200
you may not be able to actually you know have a projector built into your Xbox 360 or we

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:17.620
but you can make your own power glove and that's what someone's done actually they have

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:24.720
modified a power glove to put a black we remote on it and they've captured the hearts of geeks

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:31.000
everywhere for about five minutes until the next video comes out with something else even

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.800
more shiny I don't know it's stupid but I'm sure someone was going to do it at some point

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:45.800
and I'm sure someone has commented on this video it's so bad let me see how many posts

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:55.840
it took to say it's so bad you know I am actually surprised oh oh oh eight posts eight posts

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:01.720
all right there you go speaking of things that are so bad this is this is so so bad

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:07.840
it's good I mean like so awesome you know bad meaning good get this the DS Lite has

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:12.560
some new decals being made for it you can turn your DS Lite you know you can use the

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:18.840
decals to change your DS Lite and they're being sold by Sanrio that's right you can

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:25.520
make your DS Lite the Hello Kitty DS Lite oh how fun is that going to be for the low

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:32.840
low price of 680 yen that's about five dollars and ninety cents you can get this from Sanrio

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:37.880
so awesome and they look best by the way on the pink DS's just so you know goodie just

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:42.840
more reason for me to get a pink DS Lite this Christmas well those pink lights are going

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:46.720
for a lot of money actually on eBay from what I've been hearing really of course my customers

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:51.680
are still in stock in most places no eBay people are selling out of them quick interesting

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:59.880
anyways apparently Canada is bleeding up your DS stylus future shop you can actually purchase

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:10.900
a 18 karat gold stylus for the low low price of $19.99 and wow Neil that would really suck

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:17.760
if you lost that one because is that like one of the fat ones or the light light so

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.800
then it's like one of the fat pens because the DS Lite actually had a fatter pen and

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:28.120
my guess is probably it's gold plated it'd be funny if this is gold painted well it might

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:35.700
be painted in the 14 karat gold or whatever it is I don't know all right well something

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:39.440
else I'm sure people are going to be paying a lot of money for depends if they decide

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:44.960
to charge this for this or not but there is a huge rabid fan base around the television

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:49.080
show that used to be on the air called Firefly and you might remember they made it into a

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:53.880
movie as well called serenity I didn't really follow the TV show but extra firm you know

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:59.200
my roommate is a huge Whedon whore you know Buffy and angel and all that so I got dragged

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.000
to see serenity the day it opened it wasn't bad I was right it was pretty good I didn't

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.640
fall if I did get an HD DVD player I would buy serenity serenity a good movie for HD

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:11.520
or any sci-fi movie really would be good well that's not what I'm reporting on what I'm

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:18.840
talking about is that this has been licensed for an MMO multiverse has struck a deal with

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:25.520
Fox to put the Firefly property into the MMO ring now keep in mind this is very early on

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:31.160
there's no development team yet put together like this but they want to do a type of Star

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:37.940
Wars galaxy type game but they say they will make it unique and fun and interesting so

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:43.280
it probably won't happen till 2008 but that could be very interesting and there's certainly

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.080
a huge fan base out there that'll at least check this out for curiosity factor alone

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:51.640
what'd you think I think so I didn't even check it out even though I don't know much

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:56.920
about the series it's like you know space cowboys I mean it's it's definitely unique

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:01.200
and who doesn't love cowboys in outer space you gotta love the fact that the show's been

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:06.240
canceled you know and the series has been canceled and it's not coming back there's

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.880
not going to be a sequel to Serenity yeah but isn't that what happened to Star Trek

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.960
the original Star Trek got canceled pretty early on and then they made a movie and it

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:18.520
became huge but then again Serenity unfortunately did not quite have a huge box office success

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:26.180
call it Firefly the movie yeah oh well anyway that's our last story for this part A of Orange
