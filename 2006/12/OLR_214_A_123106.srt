00:00:13,183 --> 00:00:26,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight, December 31st, 2006, it's our year-end special with guests from The Bobby Blackwolf Show, STFU, Video Game Outsiders, Pod Culture, Travis Donovan Live, Destructoid.com, and Gamer Tag Radio.

2
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:32,397
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

3
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Among other things, I'm sure.

4
00:00:58,133 --> 00:00:58,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Among other things.

5
00:00:58,934 --> 00:00:59,214
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

6
00:00:59,574 --> 00:01:01,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

7
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:02,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

8
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,316
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you doing, Loki?

9
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:04,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing good.

10
00:01:04,936 --> 00:01:05,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

11
00:01:05,637 --> 00:01:05,837
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

12
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, tonight we have a little bit of a different kind of show tonight.

13
00:01:08,398 --> 00:01:10,899
[SPEAKER_07]: We've invited a lot of special guests to come on tonight.

14
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:12,640
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're probably wondering, why did we do that?

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're dedicated to independent radio and giving everyone a voice.

16
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:24,865
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do that through the Skype line every week, taking your calls to our 800 number, your voicemails of the week that you leave at 877-GAME-OLR.com.

17
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:27,767
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakra, how was your gaming week?

18
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:53,573
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty fun.

19
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:58,335
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Cooking Mama at the doctor's office, which was entertaining.

20
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:00,476
[SPEAKER_07]: You were poking Mama's steak at the doctor's office?

21
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:00,936
[SPEAKER_07]: That's gross.

22
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:02,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pulling the heads off of shrimp.

23
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:03,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

24
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:16,785
[SPEAKER_01]: And then went to Roosevelt Golf Line last night, the horrible place that it is, and played lots of Derby Owners Club until it pissed me off that the G1 race was for mares and I had a stallion.

25
00:02:18,343 --> 00:02:19,864
[SPEAKER_01]: But my horse, Pulp Eater, is awesome.

26
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:27,990
[SPEAKER_07]: For those that have never played Derby Owner's Club, because they don't have a lot of these machines everywhere, please explain real quickly, for those that may not know, what is Derby Owner's Crack?

27
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:34,535
[SPEAKER_01]: The way the machine looks is you've got two, are they plasma screens?

28
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:35,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they are.

29
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:36,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe so.

30
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:37,337
[SPEAKER_04]: They're projection screens.

31
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, the one at Resolve has a ton of burn-in anyway.

32
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:46,564
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're two screens side-by-side so that you get a very, very large widescreen.

33
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:48,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have different consoles.

34
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:50,555
[SPEAKER_01]: They have one that's either four or eight.

35
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:53,576
[SPEAKER_01]: And you sit at that.

36
00:02:53,696 --> 00:02:56,057
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pay money to breed horses.

37
00:02:56,697 --> 00:02:58,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you train your horse.

38
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,858
[SPEAKER_01]: You race your horse.

39
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:10,261
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a while, after you start breeding your own horses off of your little cards that you get, you can get zebra-looking horses, albino horses.

40
00:03:11,702 --> 00:03:14,343
[SPEAKER_01]: One person last night had one that looked like that weird...

41
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:19,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say it's in the same family as Antelope.

42
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:23,801
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the white jaw, the zebra-striped legs.

43
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,603
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other jokes of God.

44
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:27,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I think I'm here.

45
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:30,608
[SPEAKER_07]: So what is so alluring about Derby Owner's Crack?

46
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:32,303
[SPEAKER_01]: You race your horses.

47
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:32,964
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crack.

48
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:34,044
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just addicting.

49
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:35,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually was playing this game.

50
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:36,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do people play Pokemon?

51
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:42,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I was playing this game last night as well, and I had a horse called Paris Hilton, because you get to whip your horse as part of the game.

52
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:44,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of fun to say, hey, I'm beating Paris Hilton.

53
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:45,668
[SPEAKER_01]: My horse was a throwaway.

54
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I named him Poopeater, which I guess DJ Poopeater might appreciate.

55
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even think about it.

56
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,611
[SPEAKER_01]: But my next horse I'm going to do, if I get a mare, I'm going to name it Your Mom.

57
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:56,552
[SPEAKER_01]: So people say, what were you doing?

58
00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:58,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was with your mom last night.

59
00:03:59,213 --> 00:03:59,373
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

60
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:01,378
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so mature.

61
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:03,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I played DDR Supernova.

62
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:04,839
[SPEAKER_01]: That machine sucks.

63
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the game was fun.

64
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,100
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.

65
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Except the pads were, it was the same old crappy extreme machine that was at Roosevelt Golf Land, and the pads were shitty.

66
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:22,424
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, though, when we were playing You're Not Here, I think I twisted my knee, because on the last song, my right knee just started to really kill me.

67
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:23,784
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

68
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:25,005
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I stopped, right?

69
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:26,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know me, I don't stop.

70
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:29,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, hell, am I old?

71
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,681
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

72
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:56,329
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

73
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:18,033
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

74
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:19,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

75
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:24,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, other than watching Extrovert play Alien Crush on the Virtual Console.

76
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:25,837
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been obsessed with that game.

77
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:28,238
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs Devil's Crush, though, because Devil's Crush is so cool.

78
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:32,800
[SPEAKER_07]: He says Alien Crush is the best Virtual Console game out there right now, which I entirely disagree with.

79
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Gunstar Heroes was a pretty... I was actually pretty impressed at how well emulated some of these games are.

80
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:40,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Castlevania IV for life, yo.

81
00:05:41,063 --> 00:05:44,245
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to somehow put Dracula X on there, because then that would be...

82
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:46,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the shitty Super Nintendo 1.

83
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:46,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, no, no.

84
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:47,408
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no.

85
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:47,969
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no.

86
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:49,110
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Loki.

87
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:51,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I, too, played a game with a horse.

88
00:05:51,832 --> 00:05:53,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Oblivion.

89
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:53,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Furlong.

90
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:54,335
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

91
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:54,835
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

92
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:59,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Elder Scrolls Oblivion, because I thought I had sold it back, but apparently I hadn't.

93
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,524
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just loaded up a new save game and went around, and I was...

94
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:11,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Punching horses and deer and basically destroying small woodland critters.

95
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,471
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was funny, though, because when you start attacking a horse, they'll actually come after you.

96
00:06:15,511 --> 00:06:18,052
[SPEAKER_04]: So I opened the gate, and it chased me around for quite a while.

97
00:06:18,572 --> 00:06:22,933
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a sheep, I managed to kill a sheep, and it made it roll it down the hill.

98
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:28,334
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, I stole a horse and jumped it off a cliff, and then the horse, you know, tumbled to its death, which is funny.

99
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:33,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a deer, it was funny because there was a deer from far away, and I was just far enough away where I could hit it with, like, my...

100
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:43,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Magical Missile Magic Missile If there's any chicks there I want to do them You will only ever hear Rob say that I played the demo I am hell not buying this game Novadrome Horrible Horrible game It was awful

101
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:05,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I would never play that game again.

102
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:07,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

103
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:08,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

104
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the game looks like it's very cheap.

105
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,303
[SPEAKER_04]: It wants to be like a Twisted Metal type of game, but it's nowhere near like a Twisted Metal.

106
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:23,027
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just very boring and just very... I didn't even really know what the hell I was supposed to do in certain points of the game.

107
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:24,268
[SPEAKER_04]: It was dumb.

108
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:25,268
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really dumb.

109
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:27,350
[SPEAKER_04]: The arenas are very basic and stupid.

110
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,391
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think so.

111
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:33,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, of course, let's see...

112
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:36,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I played more of Call of Duty 3, actually.

113
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,819
[SPEAKER_04]: More multiplayer on that, because that's fun.

114
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:48,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been doing the thing now where it's either the anti-armor class or the sniper class or whatever.

115
00:07:48,543 --> 00:07:51,664
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's either rockets, pistol, or sniper rifle.

116
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:54,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just play a match just using just those.

117
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:54,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's we?

118
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:55,865
[SPEAKER_04]: You and your coworkers?

119
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:59,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my coworkers and I will do it during lunch.

120
00:07:59,667 --> 00:07:59,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

121
00:08:00,652 --> 00:08:01,092
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

122
00:08:01,552 --> 00:08:06,253
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really fun with rockets and stuff because I'll be driving Jeeps over them and stuff.

123
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,174
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of fun.

124
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:10,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

125
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:13,975
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's pretty much it.

126
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:17,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff this week.

127
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:19,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I went back to some really weird games.

128
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:21,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I went back and played 99 Nights.

129
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:24,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea why, but I think I just wanted to get more achievements.

130
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:25,475
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

131
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:48,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

132
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:24,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Watched me play the game one time, and then I said, here, you play on your account, and he unlocked 20 achievement points just like that, playing one time through the game, having no idea what the eff he was doing.

133
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,097
[SPEAKER_07]: He got 20 achievement points just like that.

134
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:32,939
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if you want some easy achievement points, you whores, go and play RallyX and you can increase your e-penis standings.

135
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:39,723
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, if you are a new Orange Lounge Radio listener, check out our forums, OrangeLoungeRadio.com and check out the OL Army section.

136
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:48,167
[SPEAKER_07]: It's our little clan we have across different video games dedicated to just playing games and the number one rule of the OL Army clan is don't be a dick.

137
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:54,429
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you think you can do that, then join the OL Army clan and join with some players who aren't being dicks.

138
00:09:54,829 --> 00:10:09,456
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can join our e-penis leaderboard, which is provided through mygamercard.net, and you can see the standings of all the different people and how many achievement points they have, or as we say on the program, how big your e-penis is, because that's pretty much what achievement points go towards, is how big your e-penis is.

139
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:10,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

140
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

141
00:10:57,383 --> 00:11:04,064
[SPEAKER_04]: The first mixed show is basically dance and club music, some trance music mixed with video game music.

142
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:05,384
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have long versions.

143
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:20,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for this week, for example, we had long versions of some of the Luminous tracks, some stuff from Luminous 2, stuff from DDR, and then of course mixed in with other trance and dance and club music and stuff.

144
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:21,167
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was pretty cool.

145
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:25,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the second show is called

146
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:27,047
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR Underground

147
00:11:48,055 --> 00:12:04,869
[SPEAKER_04]: and that one actually is kind of a smorgasbord of stuff normally stuff you might not normally hear on the radio like synth pop and stuff like that or you know theme shows it's kind of what I used to do on the old live wire not necessarily all dance music but just theme shows and stuff you may not have heard before

148
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at some of the feedback because we debuted it for the first time on Friday, December 29th.

149
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:11,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at some of the feedback in the thread.

150
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:12,051
[SPEAKER_07]: You got a lot of great feedback.

151
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,811
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd Magus says, Rock on, dude.

152
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:16,212
[SPEAKER_07]: First broadcast, kick some serious ass.

153
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:18,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Sycoon says, Whoa, this is good stuff.

154
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,753
[SPEAKER_07]: You should post a list of what music you use so I can go find it.

155
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:22,153
[SPEAKER_07]: And look at this from Vandalus.

156
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:23,593
[SPEAKER_07]: This is awesome, Loki.

157
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:25,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Plan on selling some mix CDs sometime?

158
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:26,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll buy them from you.

159
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:28,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, may I contract you to make some mix CDs?

160
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:29,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm serious.

161
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll compensate your time and media.

162
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:34,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I love well-done mixes and your stuff is always fab.

163
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:34,815
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great compliment.

164
00:12:35,606 --> 00:12:36,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

165
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:37,808
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was fun.

166
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:42,392
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of work, but I'm going to stick to it.

167
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:46,275
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole point is to have something for everybody at some point.

168
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:49,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you're not into trance music, but maybe you're into hardcore stuff.

169
00:12:50,158 --> 00:12:51,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

170
00:12:51,439 --> 00:13:00,406
[SPEAKER_04]: The other cool thing about it for the UK listeners is we rebroadcast it on Saturdays at noon, which is 8pm London time.

171
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:02,108
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's

172
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:04,049
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

173
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start off the show tonight.

174
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:17,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about a little bit of news.

175
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:22,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Because even though it's been a slow news week because of the holidays and everything, there have been some stories.

176
00:13:23,127 --> 00:13:25,869
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do something a little different from our usual game.

177
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:28,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually we all go around and we'll all share a little bit of news.

178
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:37,299
[SPEAKER_07]: But because tonight's show is a little bit special and the focus of tonight's show is really our guests, we're just going to give Loki about five or ten minutes to just run down some of the latest news headlines.

179
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:38,540
[SPEAKER_07]: So Loki, take it away.

180
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us what's been going on this week.

181
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:41,582
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

182
00:14:06,668 --> 00:14:10,534
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's actually pretty sweet, and they've had some pretty cool videos up from that.

183
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:22,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, now another thing that we've heard about is price drops in the 360, and what's going to make that possible, of course, is the brand new 65 nanometer processors.

184
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:26,355
[SPEAKER_04]: which are going to be a lot smaller, a lot cheaper to produce, and a lot cooler.

185
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:30,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, right now those aren't ready, and so it's actually being delayed now.

186
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:34,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of quarter one 2007, it's going to be mid-2007.

187
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:37,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that's actually going to cause 360's price to drop?

188
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,565
[SPEAKER_04]: For Microsoft it will, but they're not going to drop the price, at least not until Christmas.

189
00:14:41,585 --> 00:14:43,406
[SPEAKER_07]: They just want to make money on their consoles for a little bit.

190
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:45,748
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't drop it until they have to drop it.

191
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:51,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think when Sony finally comes around and drops the price of their console, that'll be what Microsoft's response is?

192
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:52,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

193
00:14:53,262 --> 00:14:57,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 64 is one of the titles slated to head to the Virtual Console in January.

194
00:14:58,943 --> 00:14:59,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

195
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:00,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Toad's Highway!

196
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:03,244
[SPEAKER_04]: We're probably going to get it at some point as well.

197
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,024
[SPEAKER_04]: This will make you happy, though.

198
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:08,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Additional classics coming to the Virtual Console also announced for Japan.

199
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:14,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Ice Climber, Kid Icarus, and Zelda 2 Adventures of Link will be

200
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:17,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Hedden as well, and then of course, you know, more Genesis.

201
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,164
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it, Nintendo.

202
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:20,084
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn you.

203
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:22,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Give us a new Kid Icarus.

204
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:24,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't screw with the formula.

205
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:27,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a fun little 2D game with, you know, like New Super Mario Brothers was.

206
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:30,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a fun little game that I can play on the console.

207
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:33,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Me love you long time if you do that for me.

208
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, Nintendo.

209
00:15:34,544 --> 00:15:39,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see the new things that they have over, was it the Club Nintendo Store or whatever they have?

210
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:41,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Tingle's Balloon Fight?

211
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Not in this country.

212
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not in this country.

213
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:51,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the thing tied to my Nintendo account, so every time I buy a virtual console game, it attaches to my Nintendo account.

214
00:15:51,757 --> 00:15:56,160
[SPEAKER_07]: And believe me, I have almost filled up a second screen of channels on the Wii.

215
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,743
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how many of those stupid virtual console games I've bought on Total Impulse Buys.

216
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:02,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a damn reward thing from Nintendo yet.

217
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:02,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm open.

218
00:16:03,454 --> 00:16:07,135
[SPEAKER_04]: There are three months of Nintendo Power, which is lame.

219
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:09,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got that a long time ago, though, when I registered my GameCube.

220
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:10,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoop-de-doo.

221
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:11,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyways.

222
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:17,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega Sammy is going to be teaming up with Sanrio to make some Hello Kitty games.

223
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:17,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo-hoo!

224
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:18,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, goody.

225
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:21,679
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all I'm going to report for that.

226
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad Batsamaru the game.

227
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:23,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thanks.

228
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:24,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

229
00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:37,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom, they're slated to release an amazing number of titles 77 new titles across all platforms Games on multiple platforms count more as one How many of those will be Street Fighter 2 rehashed?

230
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:39,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I think these are new games

231
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:51,989
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 of which I believe are going to be for the, no actually 6 are going to be for the Xbox 360 so that's kind of cool because they've had some good runs wait out of 77 new games 6 for the 360?

232
00:16:53,490 --> 00:17:08,739
[SPEAKER_04]: 77 games total but those 77 games are on multiple platforms so if they have something on like 6 platforms that counts as 6 games I get it now 2 rumored titles of course were going to be God Hand and Okami but that ended up being a mistranslation of

233
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:11,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Techin5 Techin Dark Resurrection Techin5

234
00:17:39,386 --> 00:17:40,886
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still holding out for Tekken 6 though.

235
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:49,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, of course, not a big surprise, but Christopher Gans is talking about doing a Silent Hill 2.

236
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:52,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

237
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:53,529
[SPEAKER_04]: You just want more Pyramid Head.

238
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:54,369
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

239
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:59,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, first of all, Red Pyramid is not my focus in Silent Hill.

240
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,231
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the other creepy, cool stuff that goes on that makes me all happy.

241
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the psychological parts behind it.

242
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:08,292
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I was checking something out.

243
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:11,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking at the various game blogs this week, and I saw something that totally made me think of you.

244
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:17,994
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to say I saw it over on Destructoid.com that they ran this story earlier this week about a pillow that involved Pyramid Head.

245
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see if I can find it here.

246
00:18:19,895 --> 00:18:23,936
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still taping live, boys and girls, so pardon the delay here.

247
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:24,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

248
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:24,736
[SPEAKER_07]: I found it.

249
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:25,056
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

250
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:29,358
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little homemade Pyramid Head pillow that says, Rape, Sweet Rape.

251
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:31,798
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought of you when I saw that.

252
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:33,719
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so sweet.

253
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:40,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, somebody on DeviantArt put up a Pyramid Head plushie, and I want one.

254
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:42,239
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's funny.

255
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:44,981
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bit of irony, I guess.

256
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:51,706
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember last week we were talking about the British sites getting penalized for selling Halo 3 beta codes.

257
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:52,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, back up for a minute.

258
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:58,591
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Silent Hill thing, I heard that the writer, or whoever they said was supposedly writing it, came out and said, no, I'm not really writing it.

259
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:01,493
[SPEAKER_07]: So is it still kind of a question mark, or what?

260
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:03,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Christopher Gans wants to do it, but, you know.

261
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:04,115
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

262
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:12,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so as I mentioned, a bit of irony from last week where Microsoft was punishing those British sites for selling Halo 3 beta codes.

263
00:19:13,844 --> 00:19:26,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, come to find out, according to the latest issue of GamePro Magazine, Microsoft will be selling Halo 3 beta invitations with Crackdown, their brand new game coming out in March, or not March, February.

264
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:33,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And, I mean, personally I was going to buy Crackdown anyways, but this is more incentive to buy it, even if you might not want to play Crackdown, you're going to buy it to get a Halo 3 beta.

265
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,131
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like rain on your wedding day.

266
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:39,651
[SPEAKER_04]: But Crackdown's an awesome game.

267
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:41,472
[SPEAKER_04]: You should pick it up anyways.

268
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:50,274
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're not a fan of Crackdown and you maybe have a PC and were a little bit disappointed by Red Steel, you'll be happy to... A little bit disappointed.

269
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:52,714
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot disappointed in Red Steel.

270
00:19:52,854 --> 00:20:02,397
[SPEAKER_04]: GoldenEye Source, the beta has been launched and you can download it now from the official website which is GoldenEyeSource.com and it looks pretty.

271
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:03,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely pretty.

272
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:19,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then, you know, we report on this probably about every month or so, but, um, brand new game coming to the Dreamcast, uh, Karos, um, and it's apparently a game, a new side-scroller, like, shooter game, and it's kind of a

273
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Black and White, actually, giving it kind of a gothic feel.

274
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:27,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Dreamcast fans, look, I know you're really attached to your system.

275
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:37,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Dreamcast was a horribly underrated and great system, I understand that, but seriously, you will not have another game as good as Soul Calibur or any of those games that were as good on Dreamcast.

276
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:37,693
[SPEAKER_07]: You won't.

277
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:43,478
[SPEAKER_07]: You think these new games are going to be like classics as good as some of those games you had on Dreamcast?

278
00:20:43,698 --> 00:20:46,140
[SPEAKER_01]: For the benefit of our listeners, I'm frumping it, Rob.

279
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:49,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I like quirky games, right?

280
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:16,907
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm saying that there's going to be some sort of built-in flash drive or hard drive into it.

281
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:26,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, some more stuff coming out from Samsung actually, a presentation that they did showcasing their 60 gigabyte 1.8 inch hard drive.

282
00:21:27,455 --> 00:21:33,560
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really a confirmation, however, there was a nice little illustration that they had

283
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:39,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm showing a PSP and it says, tagline, enjoy the movies everywhere.

284
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:48,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, you could put arms and legs on the PSP so it could vacuum my house and do my fucking dishes, but nobody's going to buy them until they actually have more of those must-have games.

285
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:50,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Metal Gear Portable Ops, good start.

286
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Luminous, yes, but needs more.

287
00:21:54,386 --> 00:22:19,213
[SPEAKER_04]: and then one last thing I'd like to mention because we were watching it before we started the show here and I highly recommend checking it out on YouTube Saints Row Glitches the Musical and absolutely hilarious if you haven't checked it out yet you can check it out on the original website that it came out on which was www.cabel.name that's C-A-B-E-L dot N-A-M-E

288
00:22:23,494 --> 00:22:31,922
[SPEAKER_04]: slash 2006 slash 12 and then buggy-saints-row-musical.html I hope you guys can write that.

289
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:36,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just go to cabal.name and I'm sure that they have a link on there.

290
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:43,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Hilarious musical and all I gotta say is where's my fucking car?

291
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:51,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, as we promised, we want to bring on some special guests to talk about the year 2006 in review.

292
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,612
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a really interesting year.

293
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:56,234
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you guys say were some of the highlights of 2006?

294
00:22:57,315 --> 00:23:01,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just in gaming, but just in your lives that go around gaming.

295
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:03,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, I think of one of the highlights being E3.

296
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,121
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, every year E3 is one of the big highlights.

297
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:08,864
[SPEAKER_07]: And just us getting to go down to the E3 outpost and everything and have a good time there.

298
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:09,985
[SPEAKER_07]: What were some of the highlights you guys thought of 2006?

299
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:13,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Corny, but I'm going to go ahead and say it.

300
00:23:13,468 --> 00:23:13,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was

301
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:14,563
[SPEAKER_01]: E3 Loki

302
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:47,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Being one of the first people in the United States to actually be able to play the DDR Supernova machine at Konami's Gamer Day.

303
00:23:48,163 --> 00:23:48,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, okay, cool.

304
00:23:49,464 --> 00:23:49,905
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

305
00:23:50,705 --> 00:23:51,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the Wii.

306
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:58,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, some of that fire burnt out when the actual console launched.

307
00:23:58,331 --> 00:23:59,052
[SPEAKER_04]: It was exciting.

308
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:01,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's like just everything.

309
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:05,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but that's because you've allowed yourself to buy a lot of crap games for that system.

310
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,798
[SPEAKER_07]: You should have just beat Zelda.

311
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,040
[SPEAKER_07]: You should have just played Zelda until you beat it.

312
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,641
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I really haven't been playing Zelda much.

313
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:11,162
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell?

314
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,471
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

315
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:36,412
[SPEAKER_07]: We never have talked to before, but we thought maybe they'd want to come on and say hi and be a part of this.

316
00:24:36,452 --> 00:24:39,854
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to thank everybody who came on, and let's kick it off.

317
00:24:39,894 --> 00:24:42,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, who's going to come on our show first and open up the first box?

318
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have Bobby Blackwolf from allgames.com.

319
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:55,161
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's go to the phones where Bobby Blackwolf is there.

320
00:24:55,321 --> 00:24:56,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby, you there?

321
00:24:56,702 --> 00:24:57,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I am.

322
00:24:57,422 --> 00:24:57,782
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

323
00:24:57,982 --> 00:24:59,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, not a lot.

324
00:24:59,063 --> 00:24:59,723
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

325
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:00,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing good.

326
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:02,040
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your holidays?

327
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,540
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't too bad.

328
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,220
[SPEAKER_06]: How about yourself?

329
00:25:05,081 --> 00:25:05,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I did pretty good.

330
00:25:05,741 --> 00:25:06,381
[SPEAKER_06]: I did pretty good.

331
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:09,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you've had a pretty good year all around over at All Games, haven't you?

332
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:11,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're trying, yeah.

333
00:25:12,343 --> 00:25:21,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it seems to me that just recently I was on dig.com looking at their podcasting list, and someone's kicking our butt by a mile on the rankings there, and I think his name is Bobby.

334
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:22,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all are joining him.

335
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:22,887
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

336
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:23,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all are coming up.

337
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:28,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you're doing pretty darn good there for just one guy doing his own show there.

338
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:35,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's hard to try to do it every week and know that I have no net, but people seem to enjoy it, so I just keep on doing it.

339
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:36,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, very good there.

340
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:39,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Bobby, you know, you've been a longtime friend of the show.

341
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:44,042
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a great time with you at the E3 Outpost this year and just hanging and, you know, bringing us into the All Games family.

342
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:46,363
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had an awesome time with everybody over there at that site.

343
00:25:46,744 --> 00:25:51,967
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely wanted you to be one of the first to play our little game here called the Year 06 in Review.

344
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:52,408
[SPEAKER_07]: So you ready?

345
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:53,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm ready.

346
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:56,250
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we've got 15 cases there.

347
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:58,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Pick one of the cases, 1 through 15.

348
00:26:00,922 --> 00:26:02,243
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's open up seven.

349
00:26:05,845 --> 00:26:10,948
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, what did you think was the best voice acting in a game in the year 2006?

350
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:15,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, keep in mind, Bobby had no idea of these categories in advance.

351
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:17,052
[SPEAKER_07]: This is all surprise.

352
00:26:17,392 --> 00:26:19,193
[SPEAKER_07]: The best voice acting, in your opinion?

353
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:20,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn.

354
00:26:21,694 --> 00:26:22,595
[SPEAKER_07]: You picked a tough one.

355
00:26:23,055 --> 00:26:23,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I did.

356
00:26:23,976 --> 00:26:25,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I screwed Lucky Seven there.

357
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Uno had no voice acting, so I can't choose that.

358
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:36,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Uno kind of did have the people going, you know, F you, draw four, bitch, right?

359
00:26:36,723 --> 00:26:41,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you play any of the, you know, well, you can't do Zelda either, because Link doesn't really talk in Zelda.

360
00:26:41,444 --> 00:26:41,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey!

361
00:26:43,005 --> 00:26:43,285
Hey!

362
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:44,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Come over here!

363
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:45,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen!

364
00:26:46,286 --> 00:26:51,008
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the ones, I actually was really impressed, and I like some of the voice acting so far in Final Fantasy XII.

365
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:59,646
[SPEAKER_06]: which may not be something a lot of people talk about because it's an old PS2 game but I want to give that game a lot of props because I have been enjoying it.

366
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:05,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XII is kind of interesting because it's such a landmark series, the Final Fantasy series.

367
00:27:06,132 --> 00:27:15,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I've personally been a Final Fantasy whore for the longest time but XII kind of got lost in this whole shuffle of next-gen systems which seems like such a shame because it's such an awesome game.

368
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:26,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and, you know, that's why I'm not that far in it, because I keep having to, like, look at other things that's going on and stuff, so I definitely want to keep playing it and get farther.

369
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,260
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, you know, right now I don't have the time to get into it.

370
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,441
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's so many side quests, too, in that game.

371
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:38,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I feel like I'm barely making any progress in that game at all, you know, with all the people that you can talk to and the hunts and all that other stuff, so.

372
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:38,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

373
00:27:38,662 --> 00:27:40,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a favorite character in Final Fantasy XII?

374
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:42,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask me when I'm a little bit farther in the game.

375
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:43,890
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm going to tell you this.

376
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:46,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's all about Balthier, by the way.

377
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:50,216
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how far you're in it, but he's the bomb, and he has a great voice actor.

378
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's one of my favorite performances of the year.

379
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:58,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, since that was a tough category to pick a game for, you get a really easy news topic.

380
00:27:58,503 --> 00:27:59,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious about your thoughts.

381
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:03,187
[SPEAKER_07]: The news topic that's in your case is Bye Bye E3.

382
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:09,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, the big news, E3 2006, the last year as we know it, quote, unquote.

383
00:28:09,913 --> 00:28:14,876
[SPEAKER_07]: What was your reaction when you heard the news about E3, you know, kind of going away and changing for the new year?

384
00:28:15,637 --> 00:28:17,478
[SPEAKER_06]: You killed my birthday, you bastards.

385
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:19,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Did that news come out on your birthday?

386
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,461
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but E3 was on my birthday.

387
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:22,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

388
00:28:22,822 --> 00:28:24,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're talking about changing the time frame to it, too.

389
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:25,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

390
00:28:26,764 --> 00:28:37,492
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no, to be serious about E3 for a second, I mean, it really got to be too much of a circus and it was very hard for me to see what I wanted to see because I had to wait for...

391
00:28:38,231 --> 00:28:39,731
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

392
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:06,208
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

393
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:24,435
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

394
00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:49,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably should put these on YouTube.

395
00:29:49,168 --> 00:29:53,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually stunk my video camera in in some of the early years to the Square presentation and videoed the whole thing.

396
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:54,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

397
00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:00,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And I should probably try to get some of that because it's on old VHSC tapes from my old camera.

398
00:30:00,752 --> 00:30:06,313
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was trying to get into a format that I can put up on YouTube or something because you're not supposed to have the cameras in there.

399
00:30:06,553 --> 00:30:08,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you get big trouble for that.

400
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,255
[SPEAKER_06]: E3 was getting worse and worse off and harder to get things done

401
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:33,948
[SPEAKER_06]: and it just became more of a spectacle.

402
00:30:33,988 --> 00:30:40,110
[SPEAKER_06]: So I knew it was going to downsize sometime, but I didn't think it was going to downsize this much and for this reason.

403
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:54,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, I don't know how DarkSakura and Loki feel, what they thought when they kind of saw that, but I kind of thought when I was walking around and looking at it, I thought, you know, something's wrong here when we have like this six-hour wait to see the Wii and then a two-hour wait to see Paris Hilton.

404
00:30:56,176 --> 00:31:00,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember getting diverted by Paris Hilton's bodyguards and I'm like, something is wrong with this picture.

405
00:31:01,098 --> 00:31:02,479
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not about video games now.

406
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:03,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

407
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,603
[SPEAKER_06]: It was about a big arcade and a big festival, and it was like the mecca for gamers.

408
00:31:08,703 --> 00:31:14,746
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what they're trying to do with the new, what is actually E3, is saying this is not for the gamers.

409
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,608
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to make this attractive for gamers to go to.

410
00:31:17,648 --> 00:31:20,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, all the gamers are saying the new E3 is boring.

411
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,311
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's exactly what the industry probably needs.

412
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:25,793
[SPEAKER_07]: So you think this new E3 is going to be a good thing?

413
00:31:26,932 --> 00:31:28,613
[SPEAKER_06]: GamePro Expo GamePro Expo GamePro Expo

414
00:31:54,117 --> 00:32:00,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Gamers want to go to E3, but E3 is not going to go to GamePro Expo, and they're not going to bring the big lavish booths.

415
00:32:00,582 --> 00:32:06,866
[SPEAKER_06]: The booth babes may not be there in as much capacity as they were at E3, and so I think the gamers might get disappointed.

416
00:32:07,286 --> 00:32:19,435
[SPEAKER_07]: So you think they'll have a lot of the same first-year issues that a lot of startup cons have, cons that we've seen in their first year that have needed room to grow, such as the Video Game Expo and Penny Arcade Expo and all those.

417
00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:20,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

418
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:21,416
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

419
00:32:21,826 --> 00:32:24,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you so much for your thoughts on the E3.

420
00:32:24,587 --> 00:32:30,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're going around, we're going to poll everybody today, try to figure out definitively what, in your opinion, was the best game of 2006.

421
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:38,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the best game, which is why I didn't vote for this in the best voice acting, is Oblivion.

422
00:32:39,511 --> 00:32:49,595
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason that I'm saying Oblivion and not any of those first-person shooters that I'm sure everybody else is saying is because I have watched my girlfriend play this game for well over 200 hours.

423
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:49,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

424
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:49,855
[SPEAKER_06]: She's

425
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:53,981
[SPEAKER_06]: She's beaten the game like twice.

426
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:59,584
[SPEAKER_06]: She's gotten all the achievements, but she still keeps on going back in and saying, oh, there's another dungeon I can go loot.

427
00:32:59,825 --> 00:33:01,005
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all the add-ons, right?

428
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:01,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

429
00:33:01,806 --> 00:33:03,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's not even just the add-ons.

430
00:33:03,027 --> 00:33:06,409
[SPEAKER_06]: She'll finish the add-ons and then just keep on going and finding new dungeons.

431
00:33:06,469 --> 00:33:08,090
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's been playing for over 200 hours.

432
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:17,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So my thing is any game that is offline single player that can hook you in that much, just like a World of Warcraft or an EverQuest could do,

433
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:20,175
[SPEAKER_06]: That deserves props.

434
00:33:20,555 --> 00:33:26,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't think people are playing Gears of War single player offline for over 200 hours and still finding new things to do.

435
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:28,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, interesting perspective.

436
00:33:28,898 --> 00:33:30,338
[SPEAKER_07]: How about the worst game of 2007?

437
00:33:30,618 --> 00:33:30,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Or 2006?

438
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:35,099
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know 2007 yet, but worst game of 2006?

439
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic the Hedgehog.

440
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, ouch.

441
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:42,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Any particular platform or just in general?

442
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:44,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in general.

443
00:33:44,882 --> 00:33:45,682
[SPEAKER_07]: What went wrong?

444
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:47,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic the Hedgehog used to be so rad.

445
00:33:47,403 --> 00:33:47,423
[SPEAKER_07]: 3D.

446
00:33:49,506 --> 00:33:49,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

447
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:52,328
[SPEAKER_07]: But this isn't the first Sonic 3D game.

448
00:33:52,648 --> 00:33:54,429
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go all the way back to Sonic on the Genesis.

449
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,091
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's where it went wrong.

450
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:01,034
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great as a 2D game, but I don't think it's working too well as a 3D game.

451
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:05,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And I liked Sonic Adventure, but it was no original Sonic.

452
00:34:05,997 --> 00:34:06,297
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

453
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:10,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, I don't think you'll be the only one to pick that as the worst game of the year.

454
00:34:10,938 --> 00:34:24,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking forward to 2007, you know, you do a lot of work with independent press, and certainly, you know, Orange Lounge being in this all-games thing, and all-games interactive, and your own show, kind of all pushing towards this independent, you know, news going into 2007.

455
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:29,210
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think the impact is going to be of the independent gaming press in 2007?

456
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think they're going to be more relevant, less relevant?

457
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:33,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think their credibility was damaged in 06?

458
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,635
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think is going to happen in 07 with the independent media?

459
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:38,597
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

460
00:35:06,758 --> 00:35:11,862
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not as in the pocket as the mainstream press.

461
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:17,247
[SPEAKER_06]: We will actually say what we feel instead of what they want us to say about a game that's in a preview.

462
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:19,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's really going to be interesting.

463
00:35:19,148 --> 00:35:21,970
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on how the companies react to the independent press.

464
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,151
[SPEAKER_06]: But Microsoft gets it.

465
00:35:23,852 --> 00:35:30,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Nintendo is trying to get it, but I think they're failing right now based on some of the other independent press that I've talked to.

466
00:35:31,418 --> 00:35:32,559
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sony, who knows?

467
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:37,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony just needs any press right now, any good press they can get.

468
00:35:38,895 --> 00:35:40,935
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, tell us a little something about your show.

469
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:44,197
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to let all our guests pimp their show, so tell us a little something about your show.

470
00:35:44,997 --> 00:35:46,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, it's the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

471
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:49,078
[SPEAKER_06]: We do it Sunday nights at 8 p.m.

472
00:35:49,138 --> 00:35:49,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Eastern, 5 p.m.

473
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:54,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Pacific, and we try our hardest to end right when Orange Lounge Radio starts.

474
00:35:55,461 --> 00:35:56,661
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on All Games Radio.

475
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:59,022
[SPEAKER_06]: We broadcast live on All Games Radio over at allgames.com.

476
00:36:00,029 --> 00:36:00,549
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

477
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:23,965
[SPEAKER_06]: XNA Game on Live XNA Game on Live

478
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:51,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Not on live arcade, but there are people that have already created games using the beta XNA because it's been out since September.

479
00:36:51,853 --> 00:36:53,856
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't think anyone's going to break through that barrier?

480
00:36:55,058 --> 00:36:56,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to get on live arcade.

481
00:36:57,802 --> 00:36:58,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

482
00:37:15,345 --> 00:37:17,485
[SPEAKER_06]: and put them on like a PlayStation Underground CD.

483
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:25,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, that would be kind of, hey, that would give some of those gaming CDs a little something extra as opposed to the same demos you can download online.

484
00:37:25,087 --> 00:37:25,627
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good idea.

485
00:37:26,207 --> 00:37:32,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, because the thing that sets XNA apart from like Xbox Live Arcade is because Xbox Live Arcade, you know, has like that 50 meg barrier.

486
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:36,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you have two gigs with XNA.

487
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:43,051
[SPEAKER_06]: So most people making XNA games probably wouldn't be able to condense it down to an Xbox Live Arcade executable.

488
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:43,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

489
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:44,660
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

490
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,760
[SPEAKER_06]: So it may have to be on CDs.

491
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:46,321
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

492
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:48,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I look forward to hearing more about this progress on your program, Bobby.

493
00:37:49,422 --> 00:37:49,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

494
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:51,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf, always a good friend of the show.

495
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:54,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks so much for being here, and happy 2006, and best to come for you in 2007.

496
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:58,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you, and Happy New Year to all y'all.

497
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:04,907
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

498
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:07,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks so much to Bobby for coming on the show.

499
00:38:07,188 --> 00:38:12,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Best Voice Acting in Bye Bye E3 were the topics he pulled out of that box.

500
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:16,219
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of sad, though, that E3 is going to be different.

501
00:38:16,339 --> 00:38:19,642
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be the big deal it was before, but I don't know.

502
00:38:19,662 --> 00:38:20,863
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you guys think about that whole thing?

503
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:22,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hopefully they'll do that.

504
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:37,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they have a bunch of alternate kind of events going on around that time anyways, and if anything, I think the lack of the official E3 will bring more gaming events, hopefully some in Northern California, and more is better, I think.

505
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Big thanks to Bobby for coming on the show.

506
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:42,882
[SPEAKER_07]: We've actually been working with Bobby pretty much all year.

507
00:38:43,543 --> 00:38:49,706
[SPEAKER_07]: We joined the All Games community probably back in January or February, I believe, is when we joined up.

508
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:53,568
[SPEAKER_07]: We've really had a good year working with Bobby's show and got to meet him in E3.

509
00:38:53,608 --> 00:38:54,588
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a good guy.

510
00:38:54,988 --> 00:38:55,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Very knowledgeable.

511
00:38:55,689 --> 00:38:59,170
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what my other favorite thing of 2006 was?

512
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:04,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Meeting Bobby and Scott and Lawrence for the first time in San Jose.

513
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,296
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

514
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:24,722
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

515
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:25,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I get this.

516
00:39:25,803 --> 00:39:38,959
[SPEAKER_07]: But then having actually met him and interacted with him, not only is he so knowledgeable with games and just has a real passion for games, but you kind of learn more about how TV can really alter the perception of what a real person is.

517
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:44,325
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know some other hosts, previous hosts on G4 Network across the board get some bad raps sometimes.

518
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:49,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Tommy Tallarico, I met him at E3, and you would think watching him on TV, like, what a pompous ass.

519
00:39:50,048 --> 00:39:51,469
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, he's actually really cool.

520
00:39:51,549 --> 00:39:52,290
[SPEAKER_07]: He's really nice.

521
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,251
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I really enjoyed that.

522
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:55,031
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's pretty cool.

523
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:56,112
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

524
00:39:56,472 --> 00:39:57,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, who's coming on next?

525
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:01,375
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be DMN from STFU.

526
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:07,630
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura and Loki

527
00:40:32,028 --> 00:40:36,550
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually quite a fun time, despite all the crap that I did talk on the episode I appeared.

528
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:42,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, did you have a good time handing out the cookies and everything to the Wii line waiters when we did that whole thing?

529
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:44,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that was a blast.

530
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here's how it's going to work, DMN.

531
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:53,555
[SPEAKER_07]: We have 14 cases for you to pick from, and inside the case is a game category and news topic we want your opinion on.

532
00:40:53,575 --> 00:40:54,456
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's it going to be, 1 through 14?

533
00:40:57,697 --> 00:40:58,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Big bucks, no whammies, 14.

534
00:40:58,857 --> 00:40:59,277
[SPEAKER_02]: 14, here we go.

535
00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:09,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, your topic is game I most want a sequel for in 2007.

536
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:12,713
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a no-brainer.

537
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:13,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Sneak King.

538
00:41:13,993 --> 00:41:14,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Sneak King!

539
00:41:16,314 --> 00:41:17,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Why Sneak King?

540
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:28,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got a chance to play it over the weekend, and I have to say that for $4, it's ridiculously simple and actually a lot of fun.

541
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,802
[SPEAKER_02]: And I need another game to buy my dad to scare the crap out of him from 407, so...

542
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:42,292
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's interesting is that game being $4 was better than some of the games that, you know, we were paying $5, $10, $8, $6, depending on what system it was.

543
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:44,532
[SPEAKER_07]: It was better than a lot of the games we were paying more money for.

544
00:41:44,993 --> 00:41:49,254
[SPEAKER_02]: It was better than a lot of the games that were retailing for $40, which is kind of scary.

545
00:41:49,494 --> 00:41:56,856
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true, that's true, because when you consider there's certain games, now I don't want to name names, but Bomberman X Zero, that they're charging $60 for.

546
00:41:56,876 --> 00:41:58,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't knock the hedgehog, I'm sorry.

547
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:02,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll get to what you think is the worst game a little later in the show.

548
00:42:02,258 --> 00:42:02,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Sneak King.

549
00:42:03,158 --> 00:42:05,179
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to see Sneak King 2 in 2017?

550
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:10,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, and I think Burger King would be smart to do it because those games are actually outselling Gears of War.

551
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:12,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but wait a minute, though.

552
00:42:12,481 --> 00:42:15,762
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a little bit of a warped statistic because you're putting the three games together.

553
00:42:16,722 --> 00:42:18,563
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still pretty good.

554
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:19,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's still not bad.

555
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:21,484
[SPEAKER_02]: They're selling over a million copies combined, which is incredible.

556
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:22,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's still not bad.

557
00:42:22,664 --> 00:42:27,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that there's another commercial entity that Microsoft should be hooking up with?

558
00:42:28,986 --> 00:42:29,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Ugh.

559
00:42:30,766 --> 00:42:31,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

560
00:42:33,107 --> 00:42:35,028
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't know.

561
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:38,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Burger King just because the king scares the crap out of everybody.

562
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't see any other corporate icons.

563
00:42:42,551 --> 00:42:44,132
[SPEAKER_07]: It did have a pretty freaky opening movie.

564
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:45,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.

565
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:47,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the Jack thing from Jack in the Box.

566
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:48,906
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy's kind of creepy too.

567
00:42:49,126 --> 00:42:49,746
[SPEAKER_07]: That might work.

568
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here's the news topic we want your opinion on.

569
00:42:52,408 --> 00:42:55,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, PlayStation 3, very controversial device this year.

570
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:58,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Specifically, the Blu-ray shortages.

571
00:42:59,072 --> 00:43:03,855
[SPEAKER_07]: The Blu-ray diode shortages causing there to be delays in PlayStation 3s this year.

572
00:43:04,255 --> 00:43:07,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it a good idea for Sony to include the Blu-ray with their console?

573
00:43:09,299 --> 00:43:10,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was inevitable.

574
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Sony...

575
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:13,667
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

576
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:38,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

577
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:07,523
[SPEAKER_07]: How important do you think it is in the war on HD DVD that Blu-ray is waging?

578
00:44:08,364 --> 00:44:12,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that being in the PlayStation 3 gives it an edge in that war?

579
00:44:13,646 --> 00:44:14,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.

580
00:44:14,706 --> 00:44:27,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I think mainly because the higher, I won't say the higher end because we all know the first generation players are crappy, but the higher priced ones are about $1,000 whereas the low end PS3 is $500 which is half the price

581
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,302
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's about the price of a pretty good HD DVD player.

582
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:41,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sony was smart in releasing at least a $500 price point on one of the versions of the PlayStation 3 to keep up with the HD DVD war.

583
00:44:42,171 --> 00:44:47,696
[SPEAKER_02]: But looking at it, it's about $500 if you get a 360 and an HD DVD drive.

584
00:44:48,116 --> 00:44:48,877
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the same thing.

585
00:44:49,377 --> 00:44:50,859
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see what happens in 2007.

586
00:44:50,919 --> 00:44:53,461
[SPEAKER_07]: What Blu-ray movie are you wanting to see really bad?

587
00:44:54,198 --> 00:44:54,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything?

588
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:55,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Talladega Nights.

589
00:44:55,458 --> 00:45:00,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no interest to see anything really in Blu-ray or HD DVD yet.

590
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to seeing Silent Hill at some point.

591
00:45:04,241 --> 00:45:05,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that should be second.

592
00:45:06,062 --> 00:45:10,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I did say over the weekend I did see Batman Begins on HD DVD and it looked really amazing.

593
00:45:10,923 --> 00:45:11,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll see.

594
00:45:11,984 --> 00:45:15,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're also taking everybody's opinion and counting it up by the end of the show.

595
00:45:15,785 --> 00:45:18,146
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you believe was the best game of 2006?

596
00:45:19,986 --> 00:45:23,047
[SPEAKER_02]: The best game of 2006 was not a console game.

597
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:24,747
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually a handheld game.

598
00:45:24,887 --> 00:45:26,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that New Super Mario Bros.

599
00:45:26,948 --> 00:45:27,688
[SPEAKER_02]: is the game of the year.

600
00:45:27,888 --> 00:45:29,028
[SPEAKER_07]: New Super Mario Bros.

601
00:45:29,068 --> 00:45:29,648
[SPEAKER_07]: game of the year.

602
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:34,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this is something I'm seeing in a lot of top ten lists, but I'm not seeing take the cake in many polls.

603
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does this game take the cake for you?

604
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:49,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you've seen throughout maybe the past five, six years, any Mario game that's come out, either has the word party after it, either has something to do with sports, or is a 3D adventure that's awful.

605
00:45:51,339 --> 00:46:00,801
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a breath of fresh air, I think, across all sorts of levels to see a 2D platformer that was fun and somewhat challenging.

606
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:04,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what do you think was the worst game of 2006?

607
00:46:06,082 --> 00:46:06,982
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a tough call.

608
00:46:08,382 --> 00:46:11,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to say... Yikes.

609
00:46:13,723 --> 00:46:15,343
[SPEAKER_07]: You must have played quite a few bad ones.

610
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:17,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you have no idea.

611
00:46:17,824 --> 00:46:18,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to say...

612
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:22,732
[SPEAKER_02]: This did come out in 2006, technically.

613
00:46:23,772 --> 00:46:25,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to say Chibi-Robo.

614
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:26,273
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this?

615
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:27,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Chibi-Robo.

616
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:28,834
[SPEAKER_02]: It was released in Europe in 2006.

617
00:46:28,874 --> 00:46:30,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

618
00:46:30,775 --> 00:46:31,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Why this game?

619
00:46:33,516 --> 00:46:40,899
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like it was ripping off Katamari Damacy a little bit, and while it was a good idea on paper, it was executed poorly.

620
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:42,299
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

621
00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:44,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's one vote for Chibi-Robo.

622
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:45,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it?

623
00:46:45,621 --> 00:46:45,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

624
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:46,781
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

625
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:47,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Chibi-Robo.

626
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:48,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Chibi-Robo.

627
00:46:48,502 --> 00:46:49,522
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never even heard of that.

628
00:46:49,966 --> 00:46:50,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I love bad games.

629
00:46:50,806 --> 00:46:51,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to look that up.

630
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:53,067
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for the GameCube.

631
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:53,807
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

632
00:46:54,307 --> 00:46:56,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I got a question for you also about 2007.

633
00:46:56,968 --> 00:47:01,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you know, I know you've got a lot of loyalty to Nintendo because, you know, you work for Nintendo.

634
00:47:01,189 --> 00:47:07,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me ask you specifically about Sony versus Microsoft because Nintendo has kind of decided to go in this whole different direction with the Wii thing.

635
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:11,132
[SPEAKER_07]: So where do you see the Sony-Microsoft war headed in 2007?

636
00:47:12,712 --> 00:47:15,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it headed towards new formats.

637
00:47:16,013 --> 00:47:17,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Microsoft's going to be...

638
00:47:21,249 --> 00:47:25,972
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to try to make some point of making games for that HD DVD drive to sell it.

639
00:47:27,532 --> 00:47:30,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Sony is going to be a lot more focused on the PS3.

640
00:47:30,674 --> 00:47:37,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one with their marketing campaigns and just the complete lack of games for their PSP, they need to scrap that.

641
00:47:37,577 --> 00:47:44,581
[SPEAKER_02]: As I've said on my own show, that thing needs to be dead by the end of 07 because the more money Sony puts into that portable...

642
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:47,549
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're going to lose even more money on it.

643
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:49,570
[SPEAKER_07]: So you think the PSP is a done deal?

644
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:55,714
[SPEAKER_07]: There's talk about they should re-release a PSP Lite kind of thing like Nintendo did, but you say no.

645
00:47:55,854 --> 00:47:56,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Scrap it all.

646
00:47:56,755 --> 00:47:59,036
[SPEAKER_02]: If you release a PSP Lite, I don't know what you're going to do.

647
00:47:59,056 --> 00:48:13,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you're going to make that thing any thinner or more portable because the thing's already... You can hold it enough and the screen's so big and I know Sony's not going to want to sacrifice dumbing down that screen

648
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:19,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize we're talking kind of the end of 2006 here, but do you think Metal Gear Portable Ops gave the system the kick in the pants it needed?

649
00:48:20,174 --> 00:48:20,354
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

650
00:48:21,055 --> 00:48:21,835
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't think it's enough?

651
00:48:22,496 --> 00:48:22,636
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

652
00:48:23,796 --> 00:48:24,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

653
00:48:24,337 --> 00:48:29,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, quick, give us a plug for your show, DMN, that you have here on Orange Launch Radio.

654
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:36,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you guys need to listen Thursdays at 7pm, Saturdays at 2pm, STFU with myself and DJ Tyrant.

655
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,246
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot quicker than this show is.

656
00:48:39,866 --> 00:48:40,607
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you trying to say?

657
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what are you trying to call small?

658
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:43,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

659
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:03,351
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

660
00:49:30,285 --> 00:49:30,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

661
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:50,619
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR cups?

662
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:54,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he sent this picture of a DDR cup from Burger King for no reason to my phone.

663
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:54,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a DDR cup.

664
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have those plastic cups, or is it just their normal cardboard cup?

665
00:49:58,701 --> 00:49:59,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's plastic.

666
00:49:59,902 --> 00:50:01,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to check the picture again.

667
00:50:01,642 --> 00:50:09,624
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny, though, is actually since I do this retail site training for Microsoft, and they have free things.

668
00:50:09,724 --> 00:50:17,226
[SPEAKER_04]: When you go through their training program, you can buy little tchotchkes and stuff, and they have an Xbox 360 Tumblr glass thing.

669
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking about buying that.

670
00:50:18,846 --> 00:50:19,647
[SPEAKER_04]: She'd get one of those.

671
00:50:19,927 --> 00:50:29,953
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, while we're talking about DDR cups, we want to give a huge Orange Lounge Radio thank you to our listener, Misty, who sent us a copy of the DDR soundtrack that they're selling at Burger King.

672
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:34,836
[SPEAKER_07]: And not only that, but Misty's always been a really great supporter of Orange Lounge Radio.

673
00:50:35,096 --> 00:50:37,178
[SPEAKER_07]: She sent us a gift certificate for Live 365.

674
00:50:37,258 --> 00:50:41,881
[SPEAKER_07]: So January is Misty month on Live 365 because essentially she's paid for it.

675
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:44,363
[SPEAKER_07]: So we wanted to say thanks to Misty.

676
00:50:44,383 --> 00:50:46,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And she also sent us samples of the jewelry she's been making.

677
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:50,387
[SPEAKER_07]: She's been making OL Army jewelry and selling it on our forums.

678
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:54,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And we gave the OL Army one to Jamie for her cell phone, and she's been using that.

679
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:55,251
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on my phone.

680
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:56,632
[SPEAKER_01]: It's oranging it up.

681
00:50:57,256 --> 00:50:58,677
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, everybody.

682
00:50:58,717 --> 00:50:59,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Misty.

683
00:50:59,638 --> 00:51:00,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

684
00:51:00,138 --> 00:51:00,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

685
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:01,059
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

686
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,483
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you, DMN, also, as well, for coming to visit and that Wii line.

687
00:51:05,523 --> 00:51:08,145
[SPEAKER_07]: When we went out and gave the cookies and soda to the Wii line.

688
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:08,686
[SPEAKER_07]: That was fun.

689
00:51:08,826 --> 00:51:10,007
[SPEAKER_07]: We met so many cool people.

690
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:12,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope some of them are still listening to the show.

691
00:51:12,049 --> 00:51:17,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw, was it the one chick that he gave, was it a hat to?

692
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:17,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

693
00:51:17,613 --> 00:51:19,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw her at GameStop the other day.

694
00:51:19,515 --> 00:51:19,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

695
00:51:20,075 --> 00:51:20,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

696
00:51:20,516 --> 00:51:21,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Did she recognize you at all?

697
00:51:21,637 --> 00:51:21,937
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

698
00:51:22,217 --> 00:51:25,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say anything because I'm an ass and I don't, I don't.

699
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to people, but I saw her and I recognized her.

700
00:51:29,144 --> 00:51:30,525
[SPEAKER_01]: She was in line with me and Chris.

701
00:51:30,565 --> 00:51:31,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she was cool.

702
00:51:31,646 --> 00:51:32,527
[SPEAKER_01]: She was hanging out with us.

703
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:34,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it, we should have emailed her and brought her on the show.

704
00:51:34,449 --> 00:51:35,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, we'll get her next time.

705
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if I see her again, I'll say hi.

706
00:51:38,514 --> 00:51:39,254
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you do that.

707
00:51:39,495 --> 00:51:41,817
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, in the meantime, let's say hi to some more guests.

708
00:51:41,897 --> 00:51:42,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, who's coming on next?

709
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:48,284
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be John and Michelle from Video Game Outsiders.

710
00:51:55,217 --> 00:51:59,901
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and we're joined on the line by Michelle and John from the Video Game Outsiders.

711
00:51:59,941 --> 00:52:01,302
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys there, Michelle, John?

712
00:52:02,482 --> 00:52:02,903
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here.

713
00:52:03,183 --> 00:52:04,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, how you guys doing?

714
00:52:04,964 --> 00:52:05,845
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, you mother?

715
00:52:08,147 --> 00:52:10,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy 2006, soon to be 2007 to you.

716
00:52:10,348 --> 00:52:12,270
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

717
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, 2006 has been a really good year for you guys, huh?

718
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:17,130
[SPEAKER_00]: It has.

719
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:23,793
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually kind of gone beyond what we thought we would do with this little podcast here, and we're enjoying it.

720
00:52:24,193 --> 00:52:24,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, awesome.

721
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:28,114
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys just recently won like an Xbox award, right?

722
00:52:28,915 --> 00:52:29,335
[SPEAKER_07]: We did.

723
00:52:29,495 --> 00:52:30,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Podcast of the Year.

724
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:31,095
[SPEAKER_07]: How about that, huh?

725
00:52:31,376 --> 00:52:32,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

726
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:33,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, you guys.

727
00:52:33,336 --> 00:52:33,836
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

728
00:52:33,856 --> 00:52:34,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

729
00:52:34,357 --> 00:52:35,317
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely a shock.

730
00:52:35,597 --> 00:52:37,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that something that was like community-based?

731
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:39,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Were the community voted, or was that like an editorial?

732
00:52:40,479 --> 00:52:45,161
[SPEAKER_00]: It was voted by people who listen to gaming podcasts, I guess, and that's why it was important to me.

733
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:45,881
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just some

734
00:52:46,394 --> 00:52:47,055
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com.

735
00:53:00,038 --> 00:53:00,598
[SPEAKER_07]: www.DarkSakura.com

736
00:53:27,489 --> 00:53:31,710
[SPEAKER_07]: So ladies first, Michelle, why don't you give me a box number 1 through 13.

737
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,790
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take a look at what's inside.

738
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:34,970
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take number 4.

739
00:53:35,751 --> 00:53:37,371
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, box number 4.

740
00:53:37,491 --> 00:53:38,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's have a look.

741
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:46,072
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, the category we would like to know your opinion on, best graphics in a game in 2006.

742
00:53:46,392 --> 00:53:48,313
[SPEAKER_07]: The best graphics of any game in 2006.

743
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:51,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Best graphics in a game.

744
00:53:51,193 --> 00:53:54,454
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to give it to a game I actually do not like, Gears of War.

745
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:55,990
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

746
00:54:16,832 --> 00:54:17,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

747
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:22,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a big relief because at our show we had a lot of people writing in like, how dare you hate this game and you're crazy.

748
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:24,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop playing your Tom Clancy stuff.

749
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell them to sit down.

750
00:54:25,821 --> 00:54:26,902
[SPEAKER_07]: People like what they like.

751
00:54:27,363 --> 00:54:27,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

752
00:54:28,764 --> 00:54:31,847
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it, but the graphics were amazing, so that's my pick.

753
00:54:32,267 --> 00:54:34,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, John, since you're on the line, you want to buy into this too?

754
00:54:34,209 --> 00:54:35,210
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think is the best graphics?

755
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:35,571
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

756
00:54:36,187 --> 00:54:37,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely agree with Gears of War.

757
00:54:37,429 --> 00:54:41,134
[SPEAKER_03]: The second game that comes to mind, though, is definitely, I think, Splinter Cell is a close second.

758
00:54:41,955 --> 00:54:42,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Double agent.

759
00:54:42,796 --> 00:54:45,239
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Gears of War, I'd say, is definitely the best looking game of the year.

760
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Without a doubt.

761
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:49,064
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it about Splinter Cell that makes it stand out to you?

762
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:53,079
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, personally I was a little disappointed with Splinter Cell.

763
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:57,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that the multiplayer just was horrible compared to what they did in the past.

764
00:54:57,181 --> 00:54:58,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved Chaos Theory.

765
00:54:58,181 --> 00:54:59,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it was a huge step backwards.

766
00:54:59,822 --> 00:55:06,126
[SPEAKER_03]: But visually, I just, you know, I look at like Sam's noggin on the screen with all the sweat and the detail and the stubble.

767
00:55:06,486 --> 00:55:07,066
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighting.

768
00:55:07,226 --> 00:55:09,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I just love the character models in that game.

769
00:55:09,267 --> 00:55:10,588
[SPEAKER_03]: So it definitely stands out for me.

770
00:55:11,088 --> 00:55:11,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, very cool.

771
00:55:11,969 --> 00:55:19,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now, you not only have a pretty big category there, but you have a really big news topic we want to know your opinion on for the year, Michelle.

772
00:55:19,453 --> 00:55:25,717
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a news topic that seems to be something that keeps going on and on and on throughout the year.

773
00:55:25,757 --> 00:55:32,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's somebody we don't refer to by name here on this program, but we'll call him Tack Johnson.

774
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:34,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

775
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, you know this guy, right?

776
00:55:38,107 --> 00:55:41,510
[SPEAKER_07]: He's somewhat of a bully in the legal sense.

777
00:55:42,031 --> 00:55:47,716
[SPEAKER_07]: And remember, he actually went to court to try to stop the game Bully on the PlayStation 2 from even coming out.

778
00:55:48,157 --> 00:55:50,479
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it about this guy you think?

779
00:55:50,539 --> 00:55:53,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you think this guy keeps wanting to pick on us gamers?

780
00:55:53,622 --> 00:55:54,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Why won't he just leave us alone?

781
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:03,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, that's funny because a long time ago on our show, I mentioned this kind of violence in video games, and I mentioned the game Bully, and John and Kyle, the other hosts, shot me down.

782
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,270
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh, nothing's become of that, and that's a fine game.

783
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:08,411
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really not that bad.

784
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:13,256
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the angle of that with the school kids, and I think that that's what's really getting this guy going.

785
00:56:13,296 --> 00:56:14,697
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, it's fine.

786
00:56:14,717 --> 00:56:20,162
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up playing violent video games, and I feel guilty when I kill a gnat, so I think the guy needs to back off.

787
00:56:21,668 --> 00:56:23,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of have an opinion about this.

788
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:26,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it all comes down to parenting and parents and all that in general.

789
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that these are just like campaign issues.

790
00:56:29,096 --> 00:56:33,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Hillary Clinton kind of lashed onto this as a campaign issue.

791
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:36,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think like the soccer moms, I don't want to get political here.

792
00:56:36,204 --> 00:56:36,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Soccer?

793
00:56:36,924 --> 00:56:46,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there's a certain demographic that don't know enough about video games and they just hear this stuff and they say, oh yeah, we should get on board with this and we should ban this too.

794
00:56:46,947 --> 00:56:47,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bunch of crap.

795
00:56:47,747 --> 00:56:52,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jack Thompson doesn't know a dick about video games.

796
00:56:52,388 --> 00:56:53,429
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't even play Bull.

797
00:56:53,669 --> 00:56:55,649
[SPEAKER_03]: He already decided that he hates it.

798
00:56:55,689 --> 00:56:57,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably one of Rockstar's tamest titles.

799
00:56:58,419 --> 00:56:59,160
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

800
00:57:23,517 --> 00:57:38,349
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think recently, and this is all kind of recently in the November, December of the year, it's kind of been that Hillary and, who's the other guy, Lieberman, have seemed to come out kind of embracing the ESRB, like almost that there's been a change in attitude, a little bit.

801
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:40,151
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't trust Lieberman.

802
00:57:40,171 --> 00:57:43,914
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Connecticut, and he ran as an independent, so we all were like, whoever, who cares?

803
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:48,477
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I want to back up here and say, you know, our podcast is not political at all.

804
00:57:48,597 --> 00:57:51,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we try not to go there because we get the mail too, yeah.

805
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:54,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Take us down a road that we never go down.

806
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:55,592
[SPEAKER_03]: We just want to have fun.

807
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:59,636
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I think this whole Yashar Bain thing is a joke.

808
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:03,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless the retailers really enforce it, it's absolutely meaningless.

809
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:08,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I see these kids trying to buy Grand Theft Auto all the time, and I think most of them succeed.

810
00:58:08,824 --> 00:58:12,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Some 50-year-old fat housewife at Walmart is going to sell the kid the game.

811
00:58:12,888 --> 00:58:14,089
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on eBay anyway.

812
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:16,832
[SPEAKER_00]: These days it's really hard to control that.

813
00:58:16,852 --> 00:58:17,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

814
00:58:17,606 --> 00:58:18,107
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, all right.

815
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:21,630
[SPEAKER_07]: We better get off this political road because I can see people emailing us already.

816
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:22,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to go down there.

817
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:23,511
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, all right.

818
00:58:23,591 --> 00:58:24,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to another box.

819
00:58:24,552 --> 00:58:25,593
[SPEAKER_07]: John, it's your turn.

820
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:26,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Go and pick a box.

821
00:58:26,854 --> 00:58:27,915
[SPEAKER_07]: One through 12 now.

822
00:58:28,896 --> 00:58:29,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Only through 12.

823
00:58:30,097 --> 00:58:30,657
[SPEAKER_03]: How about seven?

824
00:58:31,198 --> 00:58:32,539
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, box number seven.

825
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:33,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take a look.

826
00:58:33,279 --> 00:58:37,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Most hilarious video game of 2006.

827
00:58:37,483 --> 00:58:38,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Most hilarious.

828
00:58:43,539 --> 00:58:45,000
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

829
00:59:10,271 --> 00:59:14,454
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just got this twisted art direction, which I kind of appreciate.

830
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:22,401
[SPEAKER_03]: They really create these little mutant-looking rabbit characters, and you just kind of throw it in this little rabbit world, and it's just very bizarre.

831
00:59:22,781 --> 00:59:26,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny, and I think that's all I can say.

832
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:27,485
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, very cool.

833
00:59:27,525 --> 00:59:29,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Michelle, would you agree, or do you have a different pick?

834
00:59:30,569 --> 00:59:35,891
[SPEAKER_00]: for me I'm going to have I don't know if this is on the console or anything I'm going to have to go with officiallinewriter.com what?

835
00:59:36,811 --> 00:59:47,755
[SPEAKER_00]: yes it's a little web game of this guy that's on a sled and he goes flying around and I laughed for like an hour when I first played this game well you're simple we'll take it it's PC gaming we'll take it

836
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,261
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little PC game, I'm telling you, and it's a gem.

837
00:59:51,361 --> 00:59:52,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it out and you'll get a good laugh.

838
00:59:53,101 --> 00:59:54,121
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, awesome.

839
00:59:54,361 --> 01:00:02,682
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, yeah, you know, I was trying to pull up Line Rider on the Wii when the browser came out, but now I guess since they're going to make it an official game, they locked everybody out.

840
01:00:03,283 --> 01:00:04,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can't wait for that.

841
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:10,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a Flash issue because the Wii only supports Flash 7 or older, and that's like in Flash 9 or something.

842
01:00:10,624 --> 01:00:15,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we had thought that they shut people out because they're going to be releasing the full version later on as a game.

843
01:00:16,265 --> 01:00:17,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's a newer Flash version, yep.

844
01:00:18,038 --> 01:00:18,759
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

845
01:00:33,744 --> 01:00:39,926
[SPEAKER_07]: and for about a month, people were running wild like, oh my gosh, Microsoft's going to enter the handheld market.

846
01:00:40,186 --> 01:00:42,927
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to obliterate the PSP and the DS and da, da, da.

847
01:00:42,947 --> 01:00:49,149
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it turns out the Origami is just pretty much this fancy schmancy PC and that's why the screenshot of Halo was on it.

848
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:54,511
[SPEAKER_07]: So this kind of bears the question about Microsoft entering the handheld market.

849
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:56,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this something Microsoft ought to consider in 2007?

850
01:00:59,213 --> 01:01:01,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I would definitely say so.

851
01:01:01,634 --> 01:01:02,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a Nintendo fanboy.

852
01:01:03,155 --> 01:01:08,717
[SPEAKER_03]: The DS Lite has sold 34 million units compared to the PSP, which is like 18 million.

853
01:01:09,277 --> 01:01:16,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo owns that category, and I think that there's definitely a need still for a portable for an older market.

854
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:20,222
[SPEAKER_03]: The Nintendo is young and skews a little bit older, but

855
01:01:20,342 --> 01:01:20,902
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

856
01:01:46,761 --> 01:01:51,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that's something they might end up trying to do with Zune because of the iPod games and everything?

857
01:01:52,184 --> 01:01:57,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that because the thing about the Xbox is that you can download movies now.

858
01:01:57,788 --> 01:01:59,089
[SPEAKER_03]: No music is around the corner.

859
01:01:59,369 --> 01:02:01,130
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is you can't get it off the console.

860
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,171
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't take it with you.

861
01:02:02,231 --> 01:02:06,774
[SPEAKER_03]: So some device is going to enable that, be it the Zune or this other device that comes.

862
01:02:06,834 --> 01:02:08,955
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's all part of the big picture.

863
01:02:09,568 --> 01:02:10,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely do.

864
01:02:10,528 --> 01:02:11,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Michelle, what are your thoughts?

865
01:02:11,849 --> 01:02:13,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft, they need a handheld?

866
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:21,193
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they should really get into it because although the Nintendo DS is very cool, I do not like playing multiplayer on it because of the little friend code thing.

867
01:02:21,233 --> 01:02:32,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing Microsoft does and does well is the Xbox Live community and if they could get that on a handheld, I would definitely pick it up because to be able to just get up and go and play with your friends no matter where you are, that's something that the DS just doesn't have.

868
01:02:34,566 --> 01:02:37,647
[SPEAKER_07]: If you remember, the DS didn't even get online for about a year and a half.

869
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:39,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, exactly.

870
01:02:40,888 --> 01:02:45,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd agree with you there that Xbox definitely knows what they're doing when it comes to the online stuff.

871
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:45,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

872
01:02:46,111 --> 01:02:46,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

873
01:02:46,571 --> 01:02:48,572
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, one more question for you guys.

874
01:02:48,612 --> 01:02:49,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, two.

875
01:02:49,192 --> 01:02:49,913
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a two-parter.

876
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:54,795
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to know, because we're taking a tally all day long, what do you guys believe is the best game of 2006?

877
01:02:56,516 --> 01:02:57,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Michelle, we'll start with you.

878
01:02:57,216 --> 01:02:58,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Michelle, what do you think is the best game of 2006?

879
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:09,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for multiplayer, I'm going to give it to Rainbow Six Vegas, but I want to talk about single player, because to me, I was not into single player games until this game came along, and it's Oblivion.

880
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:19,727
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent countless hours, and I even played the game twice, and it just really, everybody I ever talked to kind of liked the game, except for people who didn't have time for it, so it seemed to have something for everyone.

881
01:03:19,747 --> 01:03:20,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

882
01:03:20,689 --> 01:03:22,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst game, do you want me to go right into?

883
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:23,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, why not?

884
01:03:23,111 --> 01:03:24,012
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take your worst game.

885
01:03:24,032 --> 01:03:24,672
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think, Michelle?

886
01:03:24,692 --> 01:03:30,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst game is going to be, although there were worse games, it's going to be Gears of War because I had the most hype.

887
01:03:31,217 --> 01:03:35,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because I wanted that to be good because it had the capability to be good and it just wasn't.

888
01:03:36,141 --> 01:03:36,621
[SPEAKER_00]: and DarkSakura.com.

889
01:04:04,301 --> 01:04:12,264
[SPEAKER_07]: because when I looked at E3, I thought, boy, the cover, it seems so neat how one button will do all this stuff.

890
01:04:12,504 --> 01:04:16,446
[SPEAKER_07]: But then when I actually sat down and played it, I was like, I don't like this.

891
01:04:16,726 --> 01:04:19,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to just run out there and start shooting people like Quake or Halo.

892
01:04:20,748 --> 01:04:21,068
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

893
01:04:21,388 --> 01:04:22,969
[SPEAKER_07]: John, what do you think was the best game of 2006?

894
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,803
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite game by far this year so far is Zelda for the Wii, Twilight Princess.

895
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:32,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely the best single player game of the year.

896
01:04:32,365 --> 01:04:33,806
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just absolutely immersive.

897
01:04:34,266 --> 01:04:38,450
[SPEAKER_03]: The art direction, the plot, everything about it I just absolutely love.

898
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:39,290
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what I live for.

899
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:51,279
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my favorite multiplayer game, I agree with Michelle, it's Rainbow Six Vegas with a close second Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter because I think at the end of the day that's the game I probably played the most this year is Ghost Recon.

900
01:04:51,937 --> 01:04:52,718
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, interesting.

901
01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:59,045
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so we'll put you down for it because I think it sounds like you're very passionate about the Zelda, so we'll put that down as the single best game.

902
01:04:59,065 --> 01:05:00,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, very much so.

903
01:05:00,267 --> 01:05:02,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would say so.

904
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:02,790
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

905
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:03,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Worst game.

906
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:04,792
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to hear my totem ball?

907
01:05:05,153 --> 01:05:06,614
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell is that?

908
01:05:07,355 --> 01:05:12,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder when someone was going to go to the Xbox Live and some of their questionable picks this year.

909
01:05:13,354 --> 01:05:17,076
[SPEAKER_07]: So even though the game was free, you still say it's not worth being free.

910
01:05:17,697 --> 01:05:20,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was an embarrassment to Xbox Live.

911
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:22,580
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you that.

912
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,021
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what is it about camera games anyway?

913
01:05:25,101 --> 01:05:28,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody seems to want to do camera games, but it seems to me like no one's done it right.

914
01:05:29,544 --> 01:05:32,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the eye toy, the Sony eye toy was pretty successful, though.

915
01:05:32,987 --> 01:05:35,388
[SPEAKER_07]: It was successful, but how fun was it, really?

916
01:05:35,669 --> 01:05:35,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

917
01:05:36,089 --> 01:05:37,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

918
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:41,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun for like an hour, and then it kind of, I don't know, the thrill is lost.

919
01:05:41,172 --> 01:05:41,812
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a novelty.

920
01:05:42,273 --> 01:05:45,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, best of luck to you guys in 2007.

921
01:05:45,995 --> 01:05:49,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell our listeners really quick who may not be familiar with your program, tell them a little bit about your show.

922
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:52,559
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a really stupid podcast.

923
01:05:52,759 --> 01:05:53,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, stop.

924
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:59,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we have a very relaxed kind of podcast in the atmosphere of you're just kind of talking with your friends.

925
01:05:59,803 --> 01:06:01,364
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not game experts.

926
01:06:01,384 --> 01:06:02,385
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not in the industry.

927
01:06:03,595 --> 01:06:07,577
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have a really great forum and community and I think that's what makes our show so great as well.

928
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:14,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have awesome listeners and there's actually a third host who's not here, Kyle Jones, and he's Canadian.

929
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she's our resident Canadian.

930
01:06:17,001 --> 01:06:19,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So check us out, VideoGameOutsiders.com.

931
01:06:19,562 --> 01:06:20,203
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a forum.

932
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:23,104
[SPEAKER_03]: You can download the episodes and all that, show archives, blah, blah, blah.

933
01:06:23,524 --> 01:06:26,045
[SPEAKER_03]: VideoGameOutsiders.com Alright, very cool.

934
01:06:26,146 --> 01:06:26,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Check that out you guys.

935
01:06:26,846 --> 01:06:28,247
[SPEAKER_07]: It's VideoGameOutsiders.com.

936
01:06:28,287 --> 01:06:29,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations to you guys on an awesome 2006.

937
01:06:30,588 --> 01:06:32,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming on our program tonight.

938
01:06:32,429 --> 01:06:33,189
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate it.

939
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:34,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having us.

940
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:35,271
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll see you in 2007.

941
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:35,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

942
01:06:36,551 --> 01:06:37,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy New Year.

943
01:06:43,575 --> 01:06:46,797
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely want to thank John and Michelle for coming on from VideoGameOutsiders.com.

944
01:06:47,082 --> 01:06:49,543
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that was one of those people that we contacted.

945
01:06:49,563 --> 01:06:59,226
[SPEAKER_07]: We really didn't know them, but we just kind of thought we'd get along with them just because, hey, you know, it's two guys and a girl that do their show, and they all met through a gaming community, and we know some of our listeners are in common.

946
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:02,987
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was very cool of them to come on without really maybe knowing who we were.

947
01:07:03,047 --> 01:07:04,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they knew beforehand or what.

948
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:06,208
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was just very cool.

949
01:07:06,368 --> 01:07:11,430
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got to say, that Michelle, she's got some pretty big balls, naming Gears of War the worst game of the year.

950
01:07:12,577 --> 01:07:16,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, it was kind of a disappointment sometimes, but maybe I need to play it more.

951
01:07:16,779 --> 01:07:18,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's fucking hard, though.

952
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, all my coworkers that bought that game said, my God, this game is so fucking hard.

953
01:07:22,722 --> 01:07:26,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm playing it on easy, and I can't fucking pass the goddamn beginning of the game.

954
01:07:26,524 --> 01:07:30,106
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, I can't say I disagree with her.

955
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:34,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I would have called it the worst game of the year, but definitely one of the biggest disappointments for me, personally.

956
01:07:35,048 --> 01:07:35,848
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

957
01:07:35,868 --> 01:07:40,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go on the record saying I think the best game of next year is going to be Earth Defense Force 2017.

958
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:42,593
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

959
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:44,373
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an awesome game.

960
01:07:44,413 --> 01:07:47,234
[SPEAKER_04]: You're fighting giant ants and robots and stuff.

961
01:07:47,654 --> 01:07:49,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, maybe it's not the best game, but it's a game I want.

962
01:07:50,115 --> 01:07:50,375
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

963
01:07:50,635 --> 01:07:54,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thanks again to those guys over at VideoGameOutsiders.com.

964
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:55,236
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pretty rad.

965
01:07:55,256 --> 01:07:58,576
[SPEAKER_04]: They just need to release the whole Simple 2000 series over here.

966
01:07:58,897 --> 01:07:59,477
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fun.

967
01:08:00,437 --> 01:08:00,757
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

968
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:03,878
[SPEAKER_07]: You're looking at this whole other world right now, Loki.

969
01:08:05,878 --> 01:08:06,378
[SPEAKER_07]: As usual.

970
01:08:06,778 --> 01:08:08,238
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, who's our next interview?

971
01:08:08,739 --> 01:08:10,579
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one is Brad from PodCulture.

972
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:20,291
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm joined here by Brad from PodCulture.

973
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:21,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the program, Brad.

974
01:08:21,591 --> 01:08:22,111
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing?

975
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:23,332
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll beat you, Kane.

976
01:08:23,552 --> 01:08:31,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, now this is a little different because PodCulture, not exactly exclusively a games podcast, but you're still a games fan, yes?

977
01:08:32,094 --> 01:08:32,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

978
01:08:32,574 --> 01:08:35,155
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of stuff do you talk about over there on PodCulture, for those that don't know?

979
01:08:36,055 --> 01:08:37,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically just geek life.

980
01:08:38,575 --> 01:08:44,617
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's me, a friend of mine I've known for, I guess, almost 20 years now, and my girlfriend, and the three of us...

981
01:08:45,748 --> 01:08:54,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Just sit around and talk about what TV we're watching, what games we're playing, what movies we're watching, that kind of stuff.

982
01:08:54,837 --> 01:08:57,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds just like what we do here but a little more geeky.

983
01:09:01,038 --> 01:09:03,599
[SPEAKER_08]: More in the pop culture business, so I guess.

984
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:04,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing wrong with that.

985
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thanks for coming on the show today, Brad.

986
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:08,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to play a little game with you.

987
01:09:08,821 --> 01:09:12,122
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's called the Year 2006 in Review.

988
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:14,483
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have 11 boxes left.

989
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:16,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you pick one of those boxes, 1 through 11.

990
01:09:16,844 --> 01:09:18,244
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll open it up and see what's inside.

991
01:09:19,144 --> 01:09:19,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Number 9.

992
01:09:19,985 --> 01:09:20,685
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, number 9.

993
01:09:20,745 --> 01:09:21,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

994
01:09:25,058 --> 01:09:27,720
[SPEAKER_07]: The best puzzle game of 2006.

995
01:09:28,381 --> 01:09:30,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you a big puzzle game fan?

996
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:32,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I like some of them, yeah.

997
01:09:32,624 --> 01:09:32,924
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

998
01:09:32,964 --> 01:09:36,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, did you have a particular favorite that you would call the best puzzle game of 2006?

999
01:09:36,227 --> 01:09:42,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know if it came out in 2006, but I started playing it in 2006.

1000
01:09:42,451 --> 01:09:42,972
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take it.

1001
01:09:43,772 --> 01:09:44,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Astro Pop.

1002
01:09:44,993 --> 01:09:45,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Astro Pop.

1003
01:09:45,574 --> 01:09:47,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe technically that was a release this year.

1004
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:49,637
[SPEAKER_07]: So on Xbox Live Arcade.

1005
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:50,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1006
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:56,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting choice, because some of those PopCap games, some folks say they don't belong on Xbox Live.

1007
01:09:57,004 --> 01:09:59,706
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it about the Astro Pop game that you like so much?

1008
01:10:00,186 --> 01:10:10,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's, I have ADD when it comes to games, so when it comes to trying to play something for a long time, I kind of lose interest in it a lot.

1009
01:10:11,534 --> 01:10:14,235
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, pick that up and just run with it.

1010
01:10:14,616 --> 01:10:18,418
[SPEAKER_07]: So Astro Pop's one of those games that you really sit down and you only play it for a little while at a time.

1011
01:10:19,022 --> 01:10:20,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't got any on Astropop.

1012
01:10:20,263 --> 01:10:20,764
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a tough game.

1013
01:10:35,919 --> 01:10:46,187
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, we also want to know your opinion on a particular news topic, and the one we have in box number nine is the PlayStation 3 line versus the Wii line.

1014
01:10:46,467 --> 01:10:51,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, in November, big, big console launches, and you hear about this violent outbreak.

1015
01:10:52,011 --> 01:11:00,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there was this comic that put it so well, is that there was this violent outbreak going on in the PlayStation 3 lines where people were getting shot and pushed into telephone poles.

1016
01:11:00,778 --> 01:11:04,381
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you go to the Wii line, and it's like people are wearing buttons that say, free hugs.

1017
01:11:04,781 --> 01:11:06,682
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's just, you know, Kumbaya and everything.

1018
01:11:07,343 --> 01:11:10,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you think there was such a radical difference between the two lines this year?

1019
01:11:13,907 --> 01:11:21,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's just that the Nintendo's more of a fun system versus the hardcore gamers on the P3 or what.

1020
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:26,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't know.

1021
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:31,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo's always had more of a fun thing around their system.

1022
01:11:31,658 --> 01:11:32,299
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been less...

1023
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:37,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Hardcore gamers than the PlayStations have been.

1024
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:38,231
[SPEAKER_08]: At least to me, anyway.

1025
01:11:38,531 --> 01:11:54,959
[SPEAKER_07]: So you think maybe when you say it's more fun, maybe the fact that there were more people in the Wii line that were really dedicated and you knew that those people were going to be playing the Wii versus the eBaying that they say was going on in the PlayStation 3 line where half those people were camping to put it on eBay.

1026
01:11:55,599 --> 01:12:01,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and you're looking at it where the system costs half as much too.

1027
01:12:01,082 --> 01:12:02,823
[SPEAKER_08]: More people are going to be able to afford to

1028
01:12:03,649 --> 01:12:04,149
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com

1029
01:12:33,723 --> 01:12:35,643
[SPEAKER_07]: You're only talking a couple of days there, really.

1030
01:12:35,864 --> 01:12:36,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's true.

1031
01:12:36,764 --> 01:12:39,544
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, what, a week, maybe a week, a couple of days?

1032
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:40,645
[SPEAKER_07]: About like four days, yeah.

1033
01:12:40,925 --> 01:12:41,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's true.

1034
01:12:41,985 --> 01:12:45,946
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, hey, just out of curiosity, did you end up waiting in line for one of these systems?

1035
01:12:47,306 --> 01:12:51,987
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I've never been a get-it-at-the-moment kind of guy.

1036
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:58,029
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only been within the past four or six months that I've even got an Xbox 360.

1037
01:12:59,569 --> 01:13:02,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to wait this little war out and see what happens, huh?

1038
01:13:02,702 --> 01:13:06,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I didn't feel like fighting the crazy lines to get a Wii.

1039
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:13,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought about getting a Wii, but I kind of looked around and then the day they went on sale, I had to work anyway.

1040
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:16,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the time I got off, everybody had sold them all out at the Targets.

1041
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:21,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think if there wasn't all this craziness around the Wii still that you might have one right now?

1042
01:13:22,995 --> 01:13:26,497
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had $250, yeah, you betcha I'd have one.

1043
01:13:27,077 --> 01:13:29,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess this is the wrong time of year to be asking right after Christmas.

1044
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:30,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

1045
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:30,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1046
01:13:31,656 --> 01:13:33,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well thanks so much for your opinion.

1047
01:13:33,538 --> 01:13:35,959
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to get your opinion on a couple more things here real quick.

1048
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:42,124
[SPEAKER_07]: We also want to know, we're taking a poll all night long, what do you believe was the best video game of 2006?

1049
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,386
[SPEAKER_07]: And your opinion using whatever criteria you want.

1050
01:13:46,487 --> 01:13:54,273
[SPEAKER_08]: The best video game that I've gotten, and this is kind of weird because it conflicts with my ADD and games, but Phantasy Star Universe.

1051
01:13:54,873 --> 01:13:59,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I've loved that whole series and I picked that up because I love the Dreamcast version and

1052
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:04,796
[SPEAKER_08]: and all that and I picked up PSU and I've had a blast with that.

1053
01:14:05,217 --> 01:14:07,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you playing more of the single player or more of the online in that game?

1054
01:14:08,601 --> 01:14:10,103
[SPEAKER_08]: About 50-50.

1055
01:14:10,823 --> 01:14:11,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe a little more online.

1056
01:14:12,955 --> 01:14:15,155
[SPEAKER_07]: This game was a little bit, I think, overlooked.

1057
01:14:15,436 --> 01:14:22,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree that Phantasy Star Universe is actually a much better title than I think a lot of people are giving it credit for, in my opinion.

1058
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:31,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I think part of the reason people are overlooking it is because it came out right around the same time that you had Final Fantasy XII, a real powerhouse RPG on Sony's PlayStation.

1059
01:14:32,839 --> 01:14:34,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think people are overlooking this game?

1060
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:42,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, as far as I can remember, Phantasy Star hasn't been the big

1061
01:14:43,194 --> 01:14:48,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Blowout, you know, that hadn't had the fanboy following maybe that Final Fantasy has.

1062
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:50,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

1063
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:56,023
[SPEAKER_07]: So what is it about Phantasy Star Universe that appeals you to that game as opposed to a game like Final Fantasy XII?

1064
01:14:57,425 --> 01:14:59,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, having never played any of the Final Fantasy games.

1065
01:15:00,347 --> 01:15:00,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1066
01:15:02,428 --> 01:15:10,654
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, you know, I create my own character, I go through it, and it's not, it doesn't seem to be as complex, or at least the...

1067
01:15:12,045 --> 01:15:13,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Phantasy Star Online didn't seem to be as complex.

1068
01:15:13,994 --> 01:15:16,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Now Phantasy Star Universe is a little more...

1069
01:15:16,735 --> 01:15:17,475
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1070
01:15:46,485 --> 01:15:55,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the worst game, it's weird because it's a fun game, but it's the worst controls, is Sneak King.

1071
01:15:56,248 --> 01:15:58,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Sneak King, worst game.

1072
01:15:58,928 --> 01:16:00,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Why'd you say Sneak King?

1073
01:16:01,549 --> 01:16:05,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's hard as hell to control that damn thing, at least to me.

1074
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:09,292
[SPEAKER_08]: So even for $4, it's too much, you think?

1075
01:16:10,813 --> 01:16:11,314
[SPEAKER_08]: $4 is $4.

1076
01:16:11,814 --> 01:16:15,458
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not that big of a deal, but it's hard as hell to discontrol it.

1077
01:16:15,758 --> 01:16:23,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think it was a little bit of a throwaway title just because of the commercial tie-in that maybe the people who developed it thought, eh, you know, it's a $4 game.

1078
01:16:23,526 --> 01:16:24,647
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need to purchase it.

1079
01:16:24,667 --> 01:16:25,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, exactly.

1080
01:16:26,109 --> 01:16:26,369
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1081
01:16:27,335 --> 01:16:29,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the quality showed up there in the end.

1082
01:16:29,216 --> 01:16:31,997
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, thank you for sharing your opinion with us there.

1083
01:16:32,418 --> 01:16:38,441
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got Phantasy Star Universe and Sneak King for best and worst of 2006, and we'll tally it up throughout the night and see where we end up.

1084
01:16:39,701 --> 01:16:42,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad, what are your plans for 2007 with PodCulture?

1085
01:16:42,423 --> 01:16:46,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Just going to kind of keep on doing the same old, same old, or any big things coming up for 2007?

1086
01:16:48,526 --> 01:16:50,107
[SPEAKER_08]: We've tweaked the format a little bit.

1087
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:52,568
[SPEAKER_08]: We're starting to go weekly rather than biweekly.

1088
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:57,048
[SPEAKER_08]: with the show, and who knows what lies in the future.

1089
01:16:57,068 --> 01:17:01,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Trying to get the word out and getting some more people listening to the show.

1090
01:17:01,353 --> 01:17:01,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1091
01:17:01,593 --> 01:17:02,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, get the word out right now.

1092
01:17:02,614 --> 01:17:06,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell them how they can tune in to PodCulture for some more geek and sci-fi chat.

1093
01:17:06,898 --> 01:17:09,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Be over at podculture.net.

1094
01:17:10,242 --> 01:17:10,802
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1095
01:17:11,443 --> 01:17:14,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's three or four different ways to subscribe to it.

1096
01:17:14,706 --> 01:17:16,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Got an iTunes link, audio link.

1097
01:17:17,648 --> 01:17:22,054
[SPEAKER_08]: and just the regular RSS feed and we're listed on Dig and PopCurrent and all that fun stuff.

1098
01:17:22,274 --> 01:17:22,554
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1099
01:17:22,714 --> 01:17:23,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Go give them a dig.

1100
01:17:23,575 --> 01:17:25,157
[SPEAKER_07]: PodCulture.net.

1101
01:17:25,197 --> 01:17:27,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad, thanks so much for coming and joining us on the show.

1102
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:33,768
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you've been a long-time listener of Orange Lounge and we appreciate the support and we're glad to have you on to support your independent program as well.

1103
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:35,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1104
01:17:41,468 --> 01:17:44,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Big thanks to Brad from PodCulture for coming on the air.

1105
01:17:44,691 --> 01:17:49,955
[SPEAKER_07]: And a little birdie told me that we might be doing some more work with PodCulture in 2007, so stay tuned.

1106
01:17:50,355 --> 01:17:55,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And I liked having Brad on, and I know some of you guys might think, boy, Brad kind of had some interesting choices there.

1107
01:17:55,639 --> 01:18:00,823
[SPEAKER_07]: But keep in mind, this is about giving every gamer their voice, from the casual gamer to the hardcore gamer.

1108
01:18:00,923 --> 01:18:04,126
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't want to just bring on a bunch of hardcore gamers, but it's important.

1109
01:18:04,586 --> 01:18:05,427
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1110
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:29,052
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

1111
01:18:52,967 --> 01:18:57,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking, you know, there's a lot of people that, you know, they shuffle into a bus and go to a casino, you know.

1112
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:02,792
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can bring that experience home, you'll maybe have the Wii puff out some cigarette smoke.

1113
01:19:04,453 --> 01:19:07,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's that hidden feature of the Wii no one knows about yet.

1114
01:19:07,454 --> 01:19:08,615
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll blow smoke in your face.

1115
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,316
[SPEAKER_07]: You are so strange.

1116
01:19:11,836 --> 01:19:12,116
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1117
01:19:12,577 --> 01:19:19,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we're going to take a little detour here because we're going to bring on some more people in segment B of our show.

1118
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,481
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, it would not be...

1119
01:19:22,442 --> 01:19:23,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I blame you for this, Rob.

1120
01:19:23,203 --> 01:19:24,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I blame you for this so hardcore.

1121
01:19:49,796 --> 01:19:55,180
[SPEAKER_01]: This, uh, the site of the week is one that, uh, Rob turned me onto.

1122
01:19:56,381 --> 01:19:58,443
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Catterday Live Journal community.

1123
01:19:59,423 --> 01:20:04,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I've been looking over and, yeah, I love Catterday.

1124
01:20:05,628 --> 01:20:08,870
[SPEAKER_01]: The sole reason I still really go to 4chan anymore is for Catterday.

1125
01:20:09,591 --> 01:20:15,015
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one, um, is community.livejournal.com slash Catterday, C-A-T-T-U-R-D-A-Y.

1126
01:20:15,075 --> 01:20:15,235
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh,

1127
01:20:17,831 --> 01:20:22,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at one right now that has a cat with one of those frilly head things and a little wand.

1128
01:20:22,694 --> 01:20:25,535
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, ban your fairy kitty, plot your death for this.

1129
01:20:26,816 --> 01:20:27,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.

1130
01:20:28,677 --> 01:20:34,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking in 2007 we ought to just change the name of the segment to DarkSakura's Cat Picture Site of the Week.

1131
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:35,220
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

1132
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's all you ever pick.

1133
01:20:36,461 --> 01:20:39,142
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no, because I also pick Doctor Who sites.

1134
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:39,802
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1135
01:20:39,822 --> 01:20:42,404
[SPEAKER_04]: God forbid they come out with a Cat Doctor Who site.

1136
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:47,074
[SPEAKER_07]: or Doctor Who gets a little cat companion.

1137
01:20:47,574 --> 01:20:49,475
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because he doesn't like cats.

1138
01:20:49,835 --> 01:20:50,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what a bastard.

1139
01:20:50,955 --> 01:21:01,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, I've got to say, though, in all honesty, you may think Jamie's a little weird for her Doctor Who obsession, but she finally did her best to make me a Doctor Who fan this week, and it's actually kind of working.

1140
01:21:01,719 --> 01:21:05,000
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been watching season one, and we're, what, like five episodes in?

1141
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,840
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually really enjoy it.

1142
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,061
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really good show.

1143
01:21:08,121 --> 01:21:09,321
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is good.

1144
01:21:09,641 --> 01:21:10,341
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm enjoying it a lot.

1145
01:21:10,361 --> 01:21:10,922
[SPEAKER_01]: We're more than that.

1146
01:21:10,962 --> 01:21:11,722
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on the...

1147
01:21:12,412 --> 01:21:12,712
[SPEAKER_01]: The Daleks

1148
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:23,973
[SPEAKER_07]: X-Terminate.

1149
01:21:44,824 --> 01:21:46,345
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do a Doctor Who MMO anymore.

1150
01:22:13,788 --> 01:22:19,672
[SPEAKER_07]: You know the reason why I love the British version of Queer as Folk is I have a total crush on Vince, who is the nerdy one there.

1151
01:22:20,052 --> 01:22:20,932
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the other guy.

1152
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:21,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1153
01:22:21,453 --> 01:22:22,814
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a stew-ass.

1154
01:22:22,974 --> 01:22:23,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Stew-ass?

1155
01:22:23,614 --> 01:22:24,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Stew-ass.

1156
01:22:24,895 --> 01:22:25,235
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1157
01:22:25,355 --> 01:22:32,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, but I've got to say that I like the BBC Queer as Folk more than the American one because it was over in like eight episodes, which is better.

1158
01:22:32,299 --> 01:22:34,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only seen one episode of the U.S.

1159
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:35,701
[SPEAKER_01]: one, and that was with the lesbians getting married.

1160
01:22:36,621 --> 01:22:37,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, isn't that sweet?

1161
01:22:37,722 --> 01:22:40,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, before this show gets any gayer, we better take a break.

1162
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:46,752
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be back here on Orange Lounge Radio Part B to talk more about the year in review.

1163
01:22:46,872 --> 01:22:47,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay tuned.

1164
01:22:47,272 --> 01:22:50,093
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Travis Donovan from Travis Donovan Live coming on.

1165
01:22:50,113 --> 01:22:52,253
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some folks from Destructoid.com.

1166
01:22:52,574 --> 01:22:53,334
[SPEAKER_07]: We love that blog.

1167
01:22:53,454 --> 01:22:57,655
[SPEAKER_07]: And Gamertag Radio getting some representation up in Part B. Stay tuned.

1168
01:22:57,695 --> 01:22:58,616
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back after this.

1169
01:22:59,036 --> 01:23:03,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
