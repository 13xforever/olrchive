We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and the Lowkey

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, December 31st, 2006, it's our year-end special with guests from the Bobby Black Wolf Show, STFU, Video Game Outsiders, Pod Culture, Travis Donovan Live, Destructoid.com, and Gamer Tag Radio

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody and welcome to another week, a very special week of Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, the gaming lifestyle, and gamer culture

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to my awesome co-host back there, it's Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yo

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How you doing?

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm amused

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Amused?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Are you amused at this year-end special we're putting on tonight?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, among other things I'm sure

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Among other things

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Alright, also say hello to the one and only tech master, Lowkey

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hello

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How you doing Lowkey?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm doing good

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Awesome

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Alright, well tonight we have a little bit of a different kind of show tonight, we've invited a lot of special guests to come on tonight

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're probably wondering why did we do that?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're dedicated to independent radio and giving everyone a voice

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And we do that through the Skype line every week, taking your calls through our 800 number, your voice mails of the week that you leave at 877-GAME-OLR

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The forums, the mailbag, all of that

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And since we always talk about supporting other independent podcasts, we wanted to invite some folks that either we've worked with

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Or even some folks we've never worked with before that just caught our eye

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We wanted to invite them on tonight to just talk about the year 2006 and reveal

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We'll get into that in a little bit, but it would not be an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, certainly not the last episode of the year

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If we didn't start it off with How Was Your Gaming Week?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
DarkStakra, how was your gaming week?

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It was pretty fun

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I played Cooking Mama at the doctor's office, which was entertaining

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You were poking mama's steak at the doctor's office? That's gross

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I was pulling the heads off of shrimp

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I see

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And then went to Roseville Golf Run last night

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The horrible place that it is

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I played lots of Derby Owners Club until it pissed me off that the G1 race was for mares and I had a stallion

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But my horse pole-beater is awesome

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
For those that have never played Derby Owners Club, because they don't have a lot of these machines everywhere

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Please explain real quickly, for those that may not know, what is Derby Owners Crack?

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The way the machine looks is you've got two, are they plasma screens? I think they are

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I believe so

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
They're projection screens

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, the one at Roseville Golf Run has a ton of burn-in anyway

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But they're two screens side-by-side so that you get a very, very large widescreen

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Then you have different consoles, they have one that's either four or eight

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And you sit at that, you can pay money to breed horses

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And then you train your horse, you race your horse

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And after a while, after you start breeding your own horses

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Off of your little cards that you get, you can get zebra-looking horses, albino horses

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
One person last night had one that looked like that weird, I want to say it's in the same family as Antelope

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's got the white jaw, the zebra-striped legs

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
One of the other jokes of God, to say, hi, I think I'm here

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So what is so alluring about Derby Owners Crack?

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You race your horses, it's crack, it's just addicting

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I actually was playing this game

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why do people play Pokemon?

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I was playing this game last night as well and I had a horse called Paris Hilton

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Because you get to whip your horse as part of the game

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So it's kind of fun to say, hey, I'm beating Paris Hilton

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
My horse was a throwaway, I named him Poop Eater

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Which I guess DJ Poop Eater might appreciate, I didn't even think about it

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But my next horse I'm going to do, if I get a mare, I'm going to name it Your Mom

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So people say, what were you doing? Oh, I was with your mom last night

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, anyway

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're so mature

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I played DDR Supernova

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That machine sucks

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I mean, the game was fun, it was pretty cool

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Except the pads were, it was the same old crappy extreme machine that was at Roseville Golf Land

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And the pads were shitty

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And I think, though, when we were playing You're Not Here

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think I twisted my knee because on the last song

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
My right knee just started to really kill me

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's why I stopped right, because you know me, I don't stop

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And I was like, hell, am I old?

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It was kind of fun to go back to the good old days

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Because, you know, when the show started about four and a half years ago

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Wherever the hell long we've been doing this now

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We all met playing DDR at the arcade

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Which some people who listen to this program may not realize

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So it's kind of funny

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But I went back to an old love

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I played Drummania

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I played a lot of Drummania

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I have a blister on my hand, it's great

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What do you think would happen if Harmonix put out Drum Hero next?

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Would you play it?

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, hell yeah

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
As long as it plays like Drummania

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I mean, honestly, it was a lot of fun

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now the thing is, they had a tall stool there, so I had to put it in auto-base

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Although I did try to play with the base a couple times

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And it's just really hard, because I'm short and the stool was not

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So I just put it in auto-base and just played all my favorite

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I was playing the old stuff more than I was playing the new stuff

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But it is pretty cool

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Anything else you want to share with the gaming week?

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Um, no

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, other than watching Extrovert play Devil's Crush

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Not Devil's Crush, Alien Crush

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
On the virtual console?

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's Devil's Crush, though, because Devil's Crush is so cool

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He says Alien Crush is the best virtual console game out there right now

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Which I entirely disagree with

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, Gunstar Heroes was a pretty-

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I was actually pretty impressed at how well emulated some of these games are

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Super Castlevania IV for life, yo

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
They need to somehow put Dracula X on there, because then that would be

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Not the shitty Super Nintendo 1, though

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Alright, Loki

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I, too, played a game with a horse

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I played Oblivion

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Final Furlong

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I played Elder Scrolls Oblivion

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Because I thought I had sold it back

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But apparently I hadn't

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So I just loaded up a new save game

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And went around

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And I was punching horses and deer

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And basically destroying small woodland critters

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And it was funny, though

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Because when you start attacking a horse

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They'll actually come after you

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So I opened the gate and it chased me around for quite a while

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And then a sheep

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I managed to kill a sheep

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And it made it roll it down the hill

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And finally I stole a horse and jumped it off a cliff

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And then the horse, no tumble to its death

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Which was funny

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And then a deer

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It was funny because there was a deer from far away

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I was just far enough away where I could hit with my

143
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You know, magical missile or whatever

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Magic missile

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So I kept shooting at the deer

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And apparently the deer doesn't mind being caught on fire

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So I thought it was funny

148
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If there's any chicks there, I want to do them

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I love Oblivion

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You will only ever hear Bob say that

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I played the demo

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Because I am hell not buying this game

153
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Novadrome

154
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Horrible

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Horrible game

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It was awful

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I would never play that game again

158
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Why not?

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Why not?

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Because the game looks like it's very cheap

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It wants to be like a Twisted Metal type of game

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But it's nowhere near like a Twisted Metal

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's just very boring and just very

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I didn't even really know what the hell I was supposed to do

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
At certain points of the game

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And it was dumb

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It was really dumb

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The arenas are very basic and stupid

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's just

170
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't think so

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Then of course, let's see

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I played more Call of Duty 3 actually

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
More multiplayer in that

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Because that's fun

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And we've been doing the thing now

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Where it's either the anti-armor class

178
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Or the sniper class or whatever

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And so it's either rockets, pistol, or sniper rifle

180
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And we just play a match just using those

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Who's we?

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You and your co-workers?

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, my co-workers and I will do it during lunch

184
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And it's fun

185
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's really fun with rockets and stuff

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Because I'll be driving Jeeps over them and stuff

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And it's a lot of fun

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Alright

189
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Anything else?

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No, that's pretty much it

191
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff this week

192
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I went back to some really weird games

193
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I went back and played 99 Nights

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I have no idea why

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But I think I just wanted to get more achievements

196
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So I'm going to play that

197
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But probably the only new game

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I gave some time to this week

199
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Was New Rally-X

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Stop laughing

201
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I really did get this

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
New Rally-X is cool

203
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You know what's interesting though

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's getting a lot of shit this week

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Because it was an arcade release

206
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That kind of let people down

207
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Because they had a bunch of independent releases

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Hey, it's New Rally-X

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It was a free game on a PSP game

210
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The only reason I got it

211
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Is because I do remember Rally-X

212
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
From when it was in the arcades

213
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And I did kind of like the game

214
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I did play Dig Dug and some of those other stuff

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So I actually got it for the nostalgia value

216
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The achievements are the easiest

217
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm so close to having the 200 out of 200

218
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
There's only one more achievement I need

219
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And that's the I get to round 7 perfectly

220
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I can get to round 6 perfectly

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So I'm almost there

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So probably the easiest achievements

223
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Of any Xbox game I've ever played

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
In fact, I even put it to the test

225
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Xtavor watched me play the game one time

226
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And then I said

227
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Here, you play on your account

228
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And he unlocked 20 achievement points

229
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Just like that

230
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Playing one time through the game

231
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Having no idea what the eff he was doing

232
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He got 20 achievement points

233
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Just like that

234
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So if you want some easy achievement points

235
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You whores

236
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Go and play Rally-X

237
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And you can increase your e-penis standings

238
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
By the way, if you are a new Orange Launch Radio listener

239
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Check out our forums

240
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
OrangeLaunchRadio.com

241
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And check out the OL Army section

242
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's our little clan we have across different video games

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Dedicated to just playing games

244
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And the number one rule of the OL Army clan

245
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Is don't be a dick

246
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So if you think you can do that

247
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Then join the OL Army clan

248
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And join with some players who aren't being dicks

249
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And you can join our e-penis leaderboard

250
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Which is provided through MyGamerCard.net

251
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And you can see the standings of all the different people

252
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And how many achievement points they have

253
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Or as we say on the program

254
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
How big your e-penis is

255
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Because that's pretty much what achievement points go towards

256
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Is how big your e-penis is

257
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight

258
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Before we start bringing on the guests

259
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
First off, we want to say we've been taped for the past couple weeks

260
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Because of the holiday

261
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But we will be back live on OrangeLaunchRadio.com

262
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We tape live on Sunday nights

263
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I know a lot of folks listen to us through our audio RSS

264
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Or podcasting feed

265
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But we do tape live on Sunday nights

266
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
At 6 o'clock Pacific time

267
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Check it out over on OrangeLaunchRadio.com

268
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We'll be back live Sunday, January 7th

269
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Also, speaking of live

270
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This is a great show

271
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's a new show we have on Orange Launch Radio

272
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's live only

273
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's not podcast because it involves RIAA music

274
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And you know you can't podcast that stuff

275
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But it's Loki's brand new mix show

276
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's called Club OLR

277
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Tell them really quickly, Loki

278
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What they can expect on Club OLR

279
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Fridays at 7 Pacific

280
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Basically, it's three different mix shows

281
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Kind of in one long block

282
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The first mix show is basically

283
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Dancing, club music

284
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Some trance music mixed with video game music

285
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So you have like long versions

286
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Like I think for this week for example

287
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We had long versions of some of the Luminous tracks

288
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Some stuff from Luminous 2

289
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Stuff from DDR

290
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And then of course mixed in with other trance and dance

291
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And club music and stuff

292
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So that was pretty cool

293
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Then the second show is called Fragged

294
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And this one is hardcore music

295
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's basically got a lot of hardcore speedcore

296
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Metal

297
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You can throw some metal in there

298
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Drum and bass

299
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Just really you know

300
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's basically touted as music to kick ass to

301
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You know the perfect thing to pop on

302
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
While you're playing a first person shooter

303
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Or something like that

304
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And the last one is the OLR Underground

305
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And that one actually is kind of a smorgasbord

306
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Of stuff normally

307
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Stuff you might not normally hear on the radio

308
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Like synth pop and stuff like that

309
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Or you know theme shows

310
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's kind of what I used to do on the old live wire

311
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Not necessarily all dance music

312
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But just theme shows

313
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And stuff you may not have heard before

314
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm looking at some of the feedback

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Because we debuted it for the first time

316
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
On Friday December 29th

317
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm looking at some of the feedback in the thread

318
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You got a lot of great feedback

319
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
23rd Magus says

320
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Rock on dude

321
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
First broadcast kick some serious ass

322
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Psycoon says

323
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Whoa this is good stuff

324
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You should post a list of what music you use

325
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So I can go find it

326
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And look at this from Vandalous

327
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is awesome Loki

328
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Plan on selling some mix CDs sometime

329
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll buy them from you

330
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Otherwise may I contract you to make some mix CDs

331
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm serious

332
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll compensate your time and media

333
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I love well done mixes

334
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And your stuff is always fab

335
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's a great compliment

336
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Thank you

337
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No it was fun

338
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's a lot of work

339
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But I'm gonna stick to it you know

340
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And it's really

341
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The whole point is to have something for everybody

342
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You know at some point

343
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You know maybe

344
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Maybe you're not into trance music

345
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Or maybe you're into hardcore stuff

346
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know

347
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So that's what we have

348
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The other cool thing about it

349
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
For the UK listeners

350
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Is we rebroadcast it on Saturdays at noon

351
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Or which is 8 p.m.

352
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You know London time

353
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So

354
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Alright

355
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So it's

356
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You know a time that's friendly to you

357
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
To listen to it

358
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So

359
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Or if you're you know in the United States

360
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You get to listen to it twice

361
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So don't say we don't love you

362
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Over there in the UK

363
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah we love you

364
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Alright

365
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Let's start off the show tonight

366
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's talk about a little bit of news

367
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Because even though it's been a slow news week

368
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Because of the holidays and everything

369
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
There have been some stories

370
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We're going to do something a little different from our usual game

371
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Usually we all go around and we'll all share a little bit of news

372
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But because tonight's show is a little bit special

373
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And the focus of tonight's show is really our guests

374
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We're just going to give Loki about 5 or 10 minutes

375
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
To just run down some of the latest news headlines

376
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So Loki

377
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Take it away

378
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Tell us what's been going on this week

379
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Okay so there's been new firmware that's been released

380
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
For the PSP

381
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Homemade firmware

382
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's been cracked

383
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Because you know the last firmware

384
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They had the PlayStation 1 emulator added

385
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And they've had stuff on the PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 3

386
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You can download for certain games and stuff

387
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Well someone's cracked that

388
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And now you can dump any PlayStation 1 game

389
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
To play it on the emulator

390
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So you've seen like Final Fantasy 7 and all that stuff

391
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This firmware makes it possible

392
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So that's actually pretty sweet

393
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And they've had some pretty cool videos up from that

394
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Of course

395
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Now another thing that we've heard about is

396
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Price drops in the 360

397
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And what's going to make that possible of course

398
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Is the brand new 65 nanometer processors

399
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Which are going to be a lot smaller, a lot cheaper to produce

400
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And a lot cooler

401
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Of course right now those aren't ready

402
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And so it's actually being delayed now

403
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Instead of Quarter 1, 2007

404
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's going to be mid-2007

405
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Do you think that's actually going to cause 360's price to drop?

406
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
For Microsoft it will

407
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But they're not going to drop the price

408
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
At least not until Christmas

409
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
They just want to make money on their consoles for a little bit

410
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They won't drop it until they have to drop it

411
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So

412
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So when Sony finally comes around and drops the price of their console

413
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That'll be what Microsoft's response is?

414
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh yeah

415
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Definitely

416
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Mario Kart 64 is one of the titles slated to head to the Virtual Console in January

417
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yay!

418
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Toe-tai-way! Toe-tai-way!

419
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We're probably going to get it at some point as well

420
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
In March

421
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
This will make you happy though

422
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Additional classics coming to the Virtual Console

423
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Also announced for Japan

424
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Ice Climber

425
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Kid Icarus

426
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yay!

427
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And Zelda II Adventures of Link

428
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Will be heading as well

429
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And then of course more Genesis

430
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
God damn it Nintendo

431
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
God damn you

432
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Give us a new Kid Icarus

433
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Don't screw with the formula

434
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Just a fun little 2D game

435
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Like New Super Mario Brothers was

436
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Just a fun little game that I can play on the console

437
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Me love you long time if you do that for me

438
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Please, Nintendo

439
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Did you see the new things that they have

440
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Over at the Club Nintendo Store

441
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Whatever they have

442
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Tingle's Balloon Fight

443
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Not in this country

444
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah, not in this country

445
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I have the thing tied to my Nintendo account

446
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So every time I buy a Virtual Console game

447
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It attaches to my Nintendo account

448
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And believe me

449
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I have almost filled up a second screen of channels

450
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
On the Wii

451
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's how many of those stupid Virtual Console games

452
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I've bought on total impulse buys

453
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Not a damn reward thing from Nintendo yet

454
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm hoping

455
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
There are three months of Nintendo Power

456
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Which is lame

457
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah, I got that a long time ago though

458
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
When I registered my GameCube

459
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Whoopie-doo

460
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Okay, anyways

461
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Sega Sammy's going to be teaming up with Sanrio

462
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
To make some Hello Kitty games

463
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Woohoo

464
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh goodie

465
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And that's all I'm going to report for that

466
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Bad Batsumaru the game

467
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
K, thanks

468
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Anyways

469
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Capcom

470
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
They're slated to release

471
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
An amazing number of titles

472
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
77 new titles

473
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Across all platforms

474
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So, you know

475
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Games on multiple platforms

476
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Count more as one

477
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
How many of those will be Street Fighter II rehashed?

478
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't know

479
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I think these are new games

480
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Seven of which, I believe

481
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Are going to be for the

482
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No, actually six

483
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Are going to be for the Xbox 360

484
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So that's kind of cool

485
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Because they've had some good ones

486
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Wait, out of 77 new games

487
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Six for the 360?

488
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
77 games total

489
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But those 77 games are on multiple platforms

490
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So if they have something on like six platforms

491
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That counts as six games

492
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh, okay

493
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I get it now

494
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Two rumored titles

495
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Of course were going to be

496
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
God Hand and Okami

497
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But that ended up being a mistranslation

498
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Of a press release

499
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So, not going to happen

500
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Tekken 5 has finally

501
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Hit the PlayStation Store

502
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
In Japan

503
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And Dark Resurrection

504
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Definitely a really good title

505
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
For their kind of arcade service

506
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Is that out in the US yet?

507
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No, I don't think so

508
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Jamie, are you going to get that on your PS3?

509
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Because you're the only one that has a PS3

510
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The Tekken Dark Resurrection?

511
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Because I know you're a Tekken fangirl

512
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Probably

513
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah, 1080p Tekken 5

514
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So that's pretty cool

515
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Pretty gin, Jamie

516
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Pretty gin

517
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm still holding out for Tekken 6 though

518
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Alright

519
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Anyways

520
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Of course, not a big surprise

521
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But Christopher Gens is talking about

522
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Doing a Silent Hill 2

523
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yay

524
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You just want more Pyramid Head

525
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No

526
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay

527
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
First of all

528
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Red Pyramid is not my focus in Silent Hill

529
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's all the other creepy cool stuff that goes on

530
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That makes me all happy

531
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I love the psychological parts behind it

532
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You know, I was checking something out

533
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I was looking at the various game blogs this week

534
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And I saw something that totally made me think of you

535
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And I want to say I saw it over on Destructoid.com

536
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That they ran this story earlier this week

537
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
About a pillow that involved Pyramid Head

538
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Let me see if I can find it here

539
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
We're still taping live, boys and girls

540
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So pardon the delay here

541
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Here we go, I found it

542
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There it is

543
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's a little homemade Pyramid Head pillow

544
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That says, rape sweet rape

545
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Aww

546
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And I thought of you when I saw that

547
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That's so sweet

548
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I want to, actually somebody on DeviantArt

549
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Put up a Pyramid Head plushie

550
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And I want one

551
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So it's funny

552
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's a bit of irony I guess

553
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But remember last week we were talking about

554
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The British sites getting penalized for selling

555
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Halo 3 beta codes

556
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Wait, wait, back up for a minute

557
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
On the Silent Hill thing

558
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I heard that the writer

559
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Or whoever they said was supposedly writing it

560
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Came out and said

561
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
No, I'm not really writing it

562
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So is it still kind of a question mark or what?

563
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I think Christopher Ganz wants to do it

564
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But you know

565
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Alright

566
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Anyways

567
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So as I mentioned a bit of irony from last week

568
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Where Microsoft was punishing those British sites

569
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
For selling Halo 3 beta codes

570
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well come to find out

571
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
According to the latest issue of GamePro Magazine

572
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Microsoft will be selling Halo 3 beta invitations

573
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
With Crackdown

574
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Their brand new game coming out in March

575
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Or not March, February

576
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And I mean personally I was going to buy Crackdown

577
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Anyways

578
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But this is more incentive to buy it

579
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Even if you might not want to play Crackdown

580
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You're going to buy it to get a Halo 3 beta

581
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's like rain on your wedding day

582
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But Crackdown's an awesome game

583
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You should pick it up anyways

584
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So

585
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But if you're not a fan of Crackdown

586
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And you maybe have a PC

587
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And were a little bit disappointed by Red Steel

588
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You'll be happy to

589
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
A little bit disappointed

590
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
A lot disappointed by Red Steel

591
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
GoldenEye Source

592
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The beta has been launched

593
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And you can download it now from the official website

594
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Which is goldeneyesource.com

595
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And it looks pretty

596
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Definitely pretty

597
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And then

598
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You know we report on this

599
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Probably about every month or so

600
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
But

601
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Brand new game coming to the Dreamcast

602
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Kuros

603
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And it's apparently a game

604
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
A new side scroller

605
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Like shooter game

606
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And it's kind of a

607
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Black and white actually

608
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Giving it kind of a gothic feel

609
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Dreamcast fans look

610
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I know you're really attached to your system

611
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Dreamcast was a horribly underrated and great system

612
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I understand that

613
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But seriously you will not have another game

614
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
As good as Soul Calibur

615
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Or any of those games that were as good on Dreamcast

616
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You won't

617
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You think these new games are going to be like

618
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Classics

619
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
As good as

620
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
As good as some of those games you had on Dreamcast

621
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
For the benefit of our listeners

622
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm frumping it Rob

623
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Won't be Shenmue

624
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'll tell you that

625
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Won't be Shenmue

626
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You can get some talented people out there to do stuff

627
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I understand

628
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But you know

629
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's just

630
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's not going to be

631
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Sega Swirl

632
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
My favorite game on Dreamcast was

633
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Freaking Rainbow Cotton

634
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yeah but you're weird

635
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Anyway

636
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I like quirky games Rob

637
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Anyways

638
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
There's another rumor going around

639
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I think we mentioned something like this before

640
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
About the Playstation

641
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Portable 2

642
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And saying that there's going to be

643
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Some sort of built in flash drive

644
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Or hard drive into it

645
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Well some more

646
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Stuff coming out

647
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
From Samsung actually

648
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
A presentation that they did

649
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Showcasing their 60 gigabyte

650
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
1.8 inch hard drive

651
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's not really a confirmation

652
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
However

653
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
There was a nice little

654
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Illustration that they had

655
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Showing a PSP

656
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And it says

657
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Tagline

658
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Enjoy the movies everywhere

659
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Look you could put arms and legs on the PSP

660
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So it could vacuum my house

661
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And do my fucking dishes

662
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But nobody's going to buy them until they

663
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Actually have more of those must have games

664
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Metal Gear Portable Ops

665
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Good start

666
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Luminous yes

667
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But needs more

668
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And then

669
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
One last thing I'd like to mention

670
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Because we were watching it before we started

671
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
The show here

672
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And I highly recommend checking it out on

673
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
YouTube

674
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Saints Row

675
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Glitches the musical

676
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And absolutely hilarious

677
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
If you haven't checked it out yet

678
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You can check it out on the original

679
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Website that came out on which was

680
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:32,000
www.cabel.name

681
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Or just go to cabel.name

682
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And I'm sure that they have a link on there

683
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Hilarious musical

684
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And all I got to say is

685
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Where's my fucking car

686
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Alright

687
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Well as we promised

688
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We want to bring on some special guests

689
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
To talk about the year 2006

690
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
In review

691
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's been a really interesting year

692
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What would you guys say were some of the highlights

693
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Of 2006

694
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Not just in gaming

695
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But just in your lives

696
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That go around gaming

697
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Like you know I think of one of the highlights

698
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Being E3

699
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You know every year E3 is one of the big highlights

700
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And just us getting to go down to

701
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The E3 Outpost

702
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And everything and have a good time there

703
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What were some of the highlights you guys thought of 2006

704
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Corny

705
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But I'm going to go ahead and say it

706
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
E3 was just getting to meet Chris

707
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
For the first time this year

708
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Because she's been so much fun to hang out with

709
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And going to Disneyland

710
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Which is why you miss all the shows you do

711
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Hey!

712
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I love Disneyland

713
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
E3 was okay

714
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I was just sort of sick the whole time

715
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So

716
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And you know

717
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's sort of like E3 was going out with a bang

718
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I guess

719
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Trying to anyway

720
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But

721
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That was I have to say among some of the fun

722
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Good stuff

723
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Loki

724
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Being one of the first people in the United States

725
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
To actually be able to play the DDR supernova machine

726
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
At Konami's gamer day

727
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Oh

728
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Okay cool

729
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That's right

730
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And then the Wii

731
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Alright

732
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Of course some of that like fire burnt out

733
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
When the actual console launched

734
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It was exciting and then it's like

735
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Okay it's like just everything

736
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Yeah but that's because you've allowed yourself to buy

737
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
A lot of crap games for that system

738
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You should have just beat Zelda

739
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You should have just played Zelda till you beat it

740
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
No I really haven't been playing Zelda much

741
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
What the hell

742
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I know

743
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Alright

744
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Shame

745
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Alright well look

746
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
What we want to do is we devise this little game

747
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
What we've got is we've got 15 boxes sitting up here on the table

748
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And we're going to invite some other podcasters, bloggers

749
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Just people throughout the community to come on

750
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And open some boxes

751
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And throughout the week we've taped some interviews

752
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
With some of our buddies out there

753
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And some people we never have talked to before

754
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But we thought maybe they'd want to come on and say hi

755
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And be a part of this

756
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So we want to thank everybody who came on

757
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And let's kick it off

758
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Jamie

759
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Jamie who's going to come on our show first

760
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And open up the first box

761
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
We have Bobby Blackwolf from AllGames.com

762
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Alright let's go to the phones where Bobby Blackwolf is there

763
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Bobby you there?

764
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yeah I am

765
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What's up?

766
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Hey not a lot

767
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
How are you doing?

768
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm doing good

769
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
How was your holidays?

770
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It wasn't too bad

771
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
How about yourself?

772
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I did pretty good

773
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I did pretty good

774
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yeah you've had a pretty good year all around

775
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Over at AllGames haven't you?

776
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Well we're trying yeah

777
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Well it seems to me that just recently I was on Dig.com

778
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Looking at their podcasting list

779
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And someone's kicking our butt by a mile on the rankings there

780
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And I think his name is Bobby

781
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yeah I think y'all are joining him

782
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What?

783
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Y'all are coming up

784
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Well you're doing pretty darn good there

785
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
For just one guy doing his own show there

786
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah it's hard to try to do it every week

787
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And know that I have no net

788
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But people seem to enjoy it so I just keep on doing it

789
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Well very good there

790
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Well Bobby you know you've been a long time friend of the show

791
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
We had a great time with you at the E3 Outpost this year

792
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And just hanging and you know bringing us into the AllGames family

793
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
We've had an awesome time with everybody over there at that site

794
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
We definitely wanted you to be one of the first to play our little game here

795
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Called the Year 06 in Review

796
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So you ready?

797
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm ready

798
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Alright we've got 15 cases there

799
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Pick one of the cases 1 through 15

800
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
7

801
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Alright let's open up 7

802
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Alright what did you think was the best voice acting in a game in the year 2006?

803
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Now keep in mind Bobby had no idea of these categories in advance

804
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
This is all a surprise

805
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The best voice acting in your opinion

806
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Damn

807
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You picked a tough one

808
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah I did

809
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I screwed lucky 7 there

810
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Cause Uno had no voice acting so I can't choose that

811
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Well Uno kind of did have the people going you know F you draw 4 bitch right?

812
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
How'd you play any of the uh you know well you can't do Zelda either cause Link doesn't really talk in Zelda

813
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Hey hey come over here

814
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Listen one of the ones I actually was really impressed and I like some of the voice acting so far in Final Fantasy 12

815
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Ahh Final Fantasy 12

816
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Which may not be something a lot of people talk about cause it's an old PS2 game

817
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But I mean I want to give that game a lot of props because I have been enjoying it

818
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Final Fantasy 12 it's kind of interesting because you know it's such a landmark series the Final Fantasy series

819
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I've personally been a Final Fantasy horror for the longest time

820
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But 12 kind of got lost in this whole shuffle of next gen systems which seems like such a shame because it's such an awesome game

821
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Right and you know that's why I'm not that far in it because I keep having to like look at other things that's going on

822
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And stuff so I definitely want to keep playing it and get farther it's just you know right now I don't have the time to get into it

823
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And there's so many side quests too in that game like I feel like I'm barely making any progress in that game at all

824
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You know with all the people that you can talk to and the hunts and all that other stuff so

825
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Do you have a favorite character in Final Fantasy 12? Ask me when I'm a little bit farther in the game

826
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Alright I'm gonna tell you this I think it's all about Balthier by the way I don't know how far you're in it but he's the bomb

827
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And he has a great voice actor I think that's one of my favorite performances of the year

828
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Okay well since that was a tough category to pick a game for you get a really easy news topic

829
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm curious about your thoughts the news topic that's in your case is bye bye E3

830
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Of course the big news E3 2006 the last year as we know it quote unquote

831
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
What was your reaction when you heard the news about E3 you know kind of going away and changing for the new year?

832
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You killed my birthday you bastards

833
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Did that news come out on your birthday?

834
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
No but E3 was on my birthday

835
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh that's right they're talking about changing the time frame to it too

836
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah so no to be serious about E3 for a second I mean it really got to be too much of a circus

837
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And it was very hard for me to see what I wanted to see because I had to wait for

838
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:48,000
The old cash register jockey from Best Buy who got in and stuff and it was really people were treating it like the world's largest arcade set to free play

839
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,000
When it was really about trying to get business done and trying to show what was going on in the game industry

840
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And things kept going behind closed doors people started like ramping back like the square presentation was not anywhere as good as it used to be

841
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah which is strange because the past two years before it it had been pretty awesome it was something I looked forward to seeing

842
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But the square presentation I was let down by it this year too every single thing we saw was Final Fantasy something everything

843
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Right well you see what the thing that got me was that all we saw in the square presentation was video

844
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And I don't know how many E3's you've gone to but square has always put on this big huge theatrical production with the video

845
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
But it incorporated the audience it was in like 360 degree rooms

846
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The first year I went they did that that was like the 360 thing I remember that

847
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Right but I mean they had stuff where they had in each chair they had like a little LCD screen that showed other information

848
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And I actually I probably should put these on YouTube I actually stunk my video camera in some of the early years to the square presentation and videoed the whole thing

849
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And I should probably stick try to get some of that because it's on old VHSC tapes from my old camera so it's trying to get into a format that I can put up on YouTube or something

850
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Because you're not supposed to have the cameras in there

851
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah you get big trouble for that

852
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah I think I have like three or four old square presentations on video

853
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Awesome that's right now this was only my 33 this year but this is what you're like your 10th 11th E3?

854
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
This was my 10th I started going when they were here in Atlanta

855
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Wow that's amazing so having been to so many E3's did you see this coming?

856
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I saw that E3 was getting kind of worse and worse off and harder to get things done

857
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And it just became more of a spectacle so I knew it was going to downsize some time but I didn't think it was going to downsize this much and for this reason

858
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yeah you know I don't know how Dark Soccer and Loki feel what they thought when they kind of saw that

859
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But I kind of thought when I was walking around and looking at it I thought you know something's wrong here

860
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
When we have like this six hour wait to see the Wii and then a two hour wait to see Paris Hilton

861
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I remember getting diverted by Paris Hilton's bodyguards and I'm like something is wrong with this picture

862
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
This is not about video games now

863
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Right it was about a big arcade and a big festival and it was like the mecca for gamers

864
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And so what they're trying to do with the new what is actually E3 is saying this is not for the gamers

865
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We're not going to make this attractive for gamers to go to and in fact all the gamers are saying the new E3 is boring

866
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But it's exactly what the industry probably needs

867
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So you think this new E3 is going to be a good thing?

868
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
For the industry yes for the gamers probably not so much

869
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So real quickly since we actually don't have this as one of the other topics

870
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
What do you think about the whole you know this new what was a game pro expo or whatever they're talking about

871
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
That might pick up that slack of what the gamers want do you think that's needed?

872
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I think that those are needed because I mean gamers have been wanting to get into E3

873
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But the problem is I don't think that the big companies are going to go into the game pro expo as much as they did with E3

874
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Gamers want to go to E3 but E3 is not going to go to game pro expo

875
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
They're not going to bring the big lavish booths the booth babes may not be there in as much capacity as they were at E3

876
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And so I think the gamers might get disappointed

877
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So you think they'll have a lot of the same first year issues that a lot of startup cons have

878
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You know cons that we've seen in their first year that have needed room to grow such as you know the video game expo and penny arcade expo and all those

879
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Exactly

880
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Alright well thank you so much for your thoughts on the E3

881
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Now we're going around we're going to poll everybody today

882
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Try to figure out definitively what in your opinion was the best game of 2006

883
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Okay the best game which is why I didn't vote for this in the best voice acting is Oblivion

884
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And the reason that I'm saying Oblivion and not any of those first person shooters that I'm sure everybody else is saying

885
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Is because I have watched my girlfriend play this game for well over 200 hours

886
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Wow

887
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:00,000
She's beaten the game like twice she's gotten all the achievements but she still keeps on going back in and saying oh there's another dungeon I can go loot

888
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's all the add-ons right?

889
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Right well it's not even just the add-ons she'll finish the add-ons and then just keep on going and finding new dungeons and she's been playing for over 200 hours

890
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So my thing is any game that is offline single player that can hook you in that much just like a World of Warcraft or an EverQuest could do

891
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:27,000
That deserves props because I don't think people are playing Gears of War single player offline for over 200 hours and still finding new things to do

892
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Alright the interesting perspective how about the worst game of 2007 or 2006 we don't know 2007 yet but worst game of 2006

893
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Sonic the Hedgehog

894
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Oh ouch any particular platform or just in general?

895
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Just in general

896
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
What went wrong? Sonic the Hedgehog used to be so rad 3D

897
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Oh

898
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:57,000
But this isn't the first Sonic 3D game you can go all the way back to Sonic on the Genesis but that's where it went wrong

899
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:05,000
It was great as a 2D game but I don't think it's working too well as a 3D game and I liked Sonic Adventure but it was no original Sonic

900
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Alright well I don't think you'll be the only one to pick that as the worst game of the year

901
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Looking forward to 2007 you know you do a lot of work with independent press and certainly you know Orange Lounge being in this all games thing

902
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and all games interactive and your own show kind of all pushing towards this independent you know news going into 2007

903
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
What do you think the impact is going to be of the independent gaming press in 2007?

904
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Do you think they're going to be more relevant? Less relevant? Do you think their credibility was damaged in 06?

905
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
What do you think is going to happen in 07 with the independent media?

906
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Some publishers will not understand it still but some will embrace it a lot more

907
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Microsoft has done a lot with the independent press because Microsoft actually gets blogging and podcasting and independent sites

908
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and there are places like you know I hate to say it because I know you're buddy buddy with them but Konami

909
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
the way they reacted to Kotaku, Joystick, whichever it was at E3

910
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:11,000
that shows that you know some people just don't understand the independent press because we're not as you know in the pocket as the mainstream press

911
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
you know we will actually say what we feel instead of what they want us to say about a game that's in a preview

912
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
and so it's really going to be interesting it depends on how the companies react to the independent press

913
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
but Microsoft gets it I think Nintendo is trying to get it but I think they're failing right now

914
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
based on some of the other independent press that I've talked to and Sony who knows

915
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Sony just needs any press right now any good press they can get

916
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Alright well tell us a little something about your show we want to let all our guests pimp their show so tell us a little something about your show

917
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Okay well it's the Bobby Black Wolf Show we do it Sunday nights at 8pm Eastern 5pm Pacific

918
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
and we try our hardest to end right when Orange Lounge Radio starts

919
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
we're on All Games Radio we broadcast live on All Games Radio over at AllGames.com

920
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
it's basically like you said it's me without a net pretty much talking and then I read chat comments

921
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I take live calls and basically I try to give my perspective on things because I can get a mic and get on the air

922
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
one of the things I'm going to be covering a lot in the beginning of 07 is XNA

923
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
because I am a programmer I've been in the programming industry a lot

924
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
and I'm really interested in seeing how easy XNA can make game programming for people who can already program

925
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and so I'm kind of delving into that in some of the techy side of what XNA really is

926
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I'll be very interested to see how this whole XNA thing plays out in 07

927
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I think it's just a matter of time before the end of the year I think we'll see our first user created XNA game on live

928
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
do you think so?

929
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:52,000
well not on live arcade but there are people that have already created XNA games using the beta XNA because it's been out since September

930
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
you don't think anyone is going to break through that barrier?

931
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,000
not to get on live arcade not by the end of 07

932
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
not by the end of this year

933
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
by the end of 07 you think someone will break through that barrier?

934
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I think someone will

935
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
it will be kind of like the net euro say hopefully that Sony did

936
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
where they took a couple of the best games and put them on a Playstation Underground CD

937
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
that would give some of those gaming CDs a little something extra as opposed to the same demos you can download online

938
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
that's a good idea

939
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,000
right because the thing that sets XNA apart from Xbox Live Arcade is because Xbox Live Arcade has that 50 meg barrier

940
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:43,000
well you have two gigs with XNA so most people making XNA games probably wouldn't be able to condense it down to an Xbox Live Arcade executable

941
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
so it may have to be on CDs

942
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
well I look forward to hearing more about this progress on your program Bobby

943
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
yep

944
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Bobby Blackwell is always a good friend of the show thanks so much for being here and happy 2006 and best to come for you in 2007

945
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:04,000
yeah thank you and happy new year to all y'all

946
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
alright thanks so much to Bobby for coming on the show

947
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
it's Best Voice Acting in Bye Bye E3 were the topics he pulled out of that box

948
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
so it's kind of sad though that E3 is going to be different

949
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
it's not going to be the big deal it was before

950
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
but I don't know what do you guys think about that whole thing

951
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
well hopefully they'll do that well they have a bunch of alternate kind of events going on around that time anyways

952
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:34,000
and if anything I think the lack of the official E3 will bring more gaming events hopefully some in Northern California

953
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and more is better I think

954
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
well big thanks to Bobby for coming on the show

955
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
we've actually been working with Bobby pretty much all year

956
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
we joined the all games community probably back in January or February I believe is when we joined up

957
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
and we've really had a good year working with Bobby's show and got to meet him in E3 he's a good guy

958
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
very knowledgeable

959
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:05,000
you know my other favorite thing of 2006 was meeting Bobby and Scott and Lawrence for the first time in San Jose

960
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
that was cool

961
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
that's true because we all went to the not Benihanas but some other type of place

962
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
just kind of kicked around

963
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
the almost Benihanas

964
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
and it was interesting because that was the first time I had seen Scott outside of television

965
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
so it was kind of interesting

966
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
surreal

967
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
yeah I remember seeing him on television I kind of used to watch that G4TV.com

968
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and I was kind of like I don't know I don't know if I get this

969
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
but then having actually met him and interacted with him not only is he so knowledgeable with games

970
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and you know just has a real passion for games

971
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
but you kind of learn more about how TV can really alter the perception of like what a real person is

972
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
you know and I know some other hosts previous hosts on G4 network across the board get some bad rap sometimes

973
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Tommy Tallarico I met him at E3 and you would think watching him on TV like what a pompous ass

974
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
but no he's actually really cool he's really nice

975
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
and so I really enjoy that so it's pretty cool

976
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
alright

977
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Jamie who's coming on next?

978
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
that would be DMN from STFU

979
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
alright please welcome to the show everybody DMN how are you?

980
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
hey

981
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm doing fantastic

982
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
hey alright it's been a big year for you

983
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
yeah it has

984
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
you've gone from OLR fanboy calling in the show every week to having your own dang show on the network

985
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
yeah that's what I get when I bug you enough

986
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
would you say that one of the highlights of 2006 was coming out here to meet myself Dark Soccer and Loki?

987
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
that was actually quite a fun time despite all the crap that I didn't talk on the episode I appeared

988
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
well did you have a good time handing out the cookies and everything to the we line waiters when we did that whole thing?

989
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
oh yeah that was a blast

990
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
alright here's how it's going to work DMN we have 14 cases for you to pick from

991
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and inside the case is a game category and news topic we want your opinion on so what's it going to be 1 through 14?

992
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
big bucks no whammies 14

993
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
14 here we go

994
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
alright your topic is game I most want a sequel for in 2007

995
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
this is a no brainer sneak king

996
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
sneak king? why sneak king?

997
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:28,000
well I got a chance to play it over the weekend and I have to say that for $4 it's ridiculously simple and actually a lot of fun

998
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and I need another game to buy my dad and scare the crap out of him for $4.07

999
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:42,000
you know what's interesting is that game being $4 was better than some of the games that we were paying $5, $10, $8, $6 depending on what system it was

1000
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
it was better than a lot of the games we were paying more money for

1001
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
it was better than a lot of the games that were retailing for $40 which is kind of scary

1002
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
that's true that's true because when you consider there's certain games now I don't want to name names

1003
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
but Bomberman X0 that they're charging $60 for

1004
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
tell him I got a hedgehog sorry

1005
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
well we'll get to what you think is the worst game a little later in the show so sneak king

1006
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
you want to see sneak king 2 in 2007

1007
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I do and I think Burger King would be smart to do it because those games are actually out selling Gears of War

1008
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
well but wait a minute though that's a little bit of a warped statistic because you're putting the three games together

1009
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
that's still pretty good

1010
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
yeah that's still not bad

1011
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
they're selling over a million copies combined which is incredible

1012
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
yeah that's still not bad

1013
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
do you think that there's another commercial entity that Microsoft should be hooking up with?

1014
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I don't know

1015
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
no I don't know I like Burger King just because the king scares the crap out of everybody

1016
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I really don't see any other corporate icons

1017
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
it did have a pretty freaky opening movie

1018
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
oh yeah

1019
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
maybe the jack thing from Jack in the Box that guy's kind of creepy too

1020
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
that might work

1021
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
alright here's the news topic we want your opinion on of course

1022
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,000
PlayStation 3 very controversial device this year specifically the Blu-ray shortages

1023
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
the Blu-ray diode shortages causing there to be delays in PlayStation 3's this year

1024
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
was it a good idea for Sony to include the Blu-ray with their console?

1025
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I think it was inevitable

1026
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I don't think Sony wasn't going to go with the DVD format anymore

1027
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I think they stepped it up with the PS1

1028
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
they said you can play games and then you have your CD player

1029
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
PS2 was like you can play your DVDs your CDs and your games

1030
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
so Sony almost put it upon themselves to introduce a new format

1031
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
yes it's a cheap Blu-ray player

1032
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,000
but I think Sony's problem was they were rushing to release this way too quickly

1033
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
and had they have held off to Spring of 07 I think they could have had a better market share

1034
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
but because they released in the holiday season they only got a total of

1035
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I want to say it worldwide 600,000 consoles if that to consumers

1036
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
it didn't sell well and a lot of those PS3's actually went back on the shelves

1037
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
because they wouldn't go for anything on eBay

1038
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
how important do you think it is in the war on HD DVD

1039
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
the Blu-ray is waging

1040
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
do you think that being in the PlayStation 3 gives it an edge in that war?

1041
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
yes I do I think mainly because the higher

1042
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I don't say the higher end because we all know the first generation players are crappy

1043
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
but the higher priced ones are about $1000

1044
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
whereas the low end PS3 is $500 which is half the price

1045
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and it's about the price of a pretty good HD DVD player

1046
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
so Sony was smart in releasing at least a $500 price point on one of the versions of the PlayStation 3

1047
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
to keep up with the HD DVD war

1048
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
but looking at it, it's about $500 if you get a 360 on an HD DVD drive

1049
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
so it's the same thing

1050
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
we'll see what happens in 2007

1051
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
what Blu-ray movie are you wanting to see really bad?

1052
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Talladega Nights

1053
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I have no interest to see anything really in Blu-ray HD DVD yet

1054
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm looking forward to seeing Silent Hill at some point

1055
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
because that should be second

1056
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I did say over the weekend I did see Batman Begins on HD DVD and it looked really amazing

1057
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
we're also taking everybody's opinion and counting it up by the end of the show

1058
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
what do you believe was the best game of 2006?

1059
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
The best game of 2006 was not a console game

1060
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
it was actually a handheld game

1061
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I believe that New Super Mario Brothers is the game of the year

1062
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
New Super Mario Brothers game of the year

1063
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
now this is something I've seen in a lot of top 10 lists

1064
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
but I'm not seeing Take the Cake in many polls

1065
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
why does this game take the cake for you?

1066
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
well if you've seen throughout maybe the past 5-6 years

1067
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
any Mario game that's come out

1068
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
either has the word party after it

1069
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
either has something to do with sports

1070
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
or is a 3D adventure that's awful

1071
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,000
it was a breath of fresh air I think across all sorts of levels

1072
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
to see a 2D platformer that was fun and somewhat challenging

1073
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
what do you think was the worst game of 2006?

1074
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
that's a tough call

1075
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I would have to say

1076
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
yikes

1077
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
you must have played quite a few bad ones

1078
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
oh you have no idea

1079
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I would have to say

1080
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
this did come out in 2006 technically

1081
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I would have to say Chibi-Robo

1082
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
what's this?

1083
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Chibi-Robo

1084
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
it was released in Europe in 2006

1085
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
oh okay

1086
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
why this game?

1087
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
it felt like it was ripping off Katamari Damacy a little bit

1088
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
and while it was a good idea on paper

1089
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
it was executed poorly

1090
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
alright well that's one vote for Chibi-Robo

1091
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
is that it?

1092
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
yes

1093
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
alright we got marked Chibi-Robo

1094
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I've never even heard of that

1095
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I love bad games I'll have to look that up

1096
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
it's for the GameCube

1097
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
alright

1098
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
hey I got a question for you also about 2007

1099
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
now I know you've got a lot of loyalty to Nintendo

1100
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
because you work for Nintendo

1101
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
so let me ask you specifically about Sony vs. Microsoft

1102
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
because Nintendo has kind of decided to go in this whole different direction with the Wii thing

1103
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
so where do you see the Sony-Microsoft war headed in 2007?

1104
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I see it headed towards new formats

1105
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I think Microsoft's going to be

1106
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
they're going to try to make some point of making games

1107
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
for that HD DVD drive to sell it

1108
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I think Sony is going to be a lot more focused on the PS3

1109
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I think one with their marketing campaigns

1110
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
and just the complete lack of games for their PSP

1111
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
they need to scrap that

1112
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
as I've said on my own show

1113
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
that thing needs to be dead by the end of 2007

1114
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
because the more money Sony puts into that portable

1115
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
they're going to lose even more money on it

1116
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
so you think the PSP is a done deal

1117
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
because there's talk about they should re-release a PSP lite

1118
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
kind of thing like Nintendo did

1119
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
but you say no scrap it all

1120
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
if you release a PSP lite I don't know what you're going to do

1121
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
you're going to have to

1122
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I don't know how you're going to make that thing any thinner

1123
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
or more portable

1124
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
because the things already

1125
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
you can hold it enough

1126
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
and the screen's so big

1127
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
and I know Sony's not going to let a sacrifice

1128
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
dumbing down that screen

1129
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I realize we're talking kind of the end of 2006 here

1130
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
but do you think Metal Gear Portable Ops gave the system the kick in the pants it needed?

1131
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
No

1132
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
No, you don't think it's enough?

1133
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
No

1134
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Alright, well quick give us a plug for your show DMN

1135
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
that you have here on Orange Launch Radio

1136
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Yeah, you guys need to listen

1137
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Thursdays at 7pm, Saturdays at 2pm

1138
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
STFU with myself and DJ Tyrant

1139
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
it's a lot quicker than this show is

1140
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
What are you trying to say?

1141
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I'm trying to say it's 45 minutes and not 3 hours

1142
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I see

1143
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Of course listen to this show too

1144
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
If you need something a little more compacted

1145
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
STFU is in a much smaller package

1146
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
What are you trying to call small?

1147
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Emphasis on small package with you DMN

1148
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Alright, in all seriousness

1149
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
it's been awesome to have you aboard

1150
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
and officially a part of the Orange Launch Radio family

1151
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and we wish a lot of success for your show in 2007

1152
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
and I hear we're going to step it up

1153
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
and do some more podcasting with STFU in 2007

1154
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
so we can look forward to that as well, right?

1155
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Oh yes

1156
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Alright, sounds good

1157
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
DMN, thanks so much for being on the program

1158
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Thanks, and you have nothing to talk about with small packages

1159
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
It's been a very interesting year, our relationship with DMN

1160
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
wouldn't you say?

1161
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
He kind of started listening earlier this year

1162
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and now he has his own show on the network, it's crazy

1163
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
He's a very interesting individual

1164
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It was cool to meet him when he came out here though

1165
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Who texts my phone with pictures of DDR cups

1166
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Yes, I got that text yesterday too

1167
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
That's funny, but that was...

1168
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
DDR cups?

1169
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Yeah, he sent this picture of a DDR cup from Burger King

1170
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
for no reason to my phone

1171
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I want a DDR cup

1172
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Do they have those plastic cups

1173
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
or is it just like their normal cardboard thing?

1174
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I think it's plastic

1175
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I'd have to check the picture again, but...

1176
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You know what's funny though

1177
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
is actually since I do this retail site

1178
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
like training for Microsoft

1179
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
and they have free things

1180
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
when you go through their training program

1181
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
you can buy little chachkies and stuff

1182
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
They have an Xbox 360 tumbler glass thing

1183
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I was thinking about buying

1184
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I should get one of those

1185
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
By the way, while we're talking about DDR cups

1186
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
we want to give a huge Orange Lounge Radio thank you

1187
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
to our listener Misty

1188
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
who sent us a copy of the DDR soundtrack

1189
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
that they're selling at Burger King

1190
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
and not only that, but

1191
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Misty's always been a really great supporter

1192
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
of Orange Lounge Radio

1193
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
She sent us a gift certificate for Live 365

1194
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
so January is Misty month on Live 365

1195
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
because essentially she's paid for it

1196
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
So we wanted to say thanks to Misty

1197
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
and she also sent us samples

1198
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
of the jewelry she's been making

1199
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
She's been making OL Army jewelry

1200
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
and selling it on our forums

1201
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
and we gave the OL Army one to Jamie

1202
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
for her cell phone

1203
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
and she's been using that

1204
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
It's on my phone

1205
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It's orange-ing it up

1206
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So thank you, Miss

1207
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Everybody, thank you, Misty

1208
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Thank you

1209
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Thank you

1210
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And thank you DMN also as well

1211
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
for coming to visit

1212
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
and that Wii line

1213
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
when we went out and gave the cookies

1214
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and soda to the Wii line

1215
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
That was fun

1216
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
We met so many cool people

1217
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I hope some of them are still listening to the show

1218
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I saw

1219
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Was it the one chick that he gave

1220
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Was it a hat too?

1221
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Yeah

1222
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I saw her at GameStop the other day

1223
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Really?

1224
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Yeah

1225
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Did she recognize you at all?

1226
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
No

1227
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I didn't say anything because I'm an ass

1228
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
and I don't talk to people

1229
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
but I saw her and I recognized her

1230
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
She was in line with me and Chris

1231
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Yeah, she was cool

1232
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
She was hanging out with us

1233
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Damn it

1234
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
We should have emailed her

1235
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and brought her on the show

1236
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Oh, well, we'll get her next time

1237
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Well, if I see her again

1238
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I'll say hi

1239
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Alright, you do that

1240
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
One more time

1241
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Let's say hi to some more guests

1242
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Jamie, who's coming on next?

1243
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
That would be

1244
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
John and Michelle

1245
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
from Video Game Outsiders

1246
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Alright, and we're joined on the line

1247
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
by Michelle and John

1248
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
from the Video Game Outsiders

1249
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
You guys there, Michelle, John?

1250
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Woohoo

1251
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
We're here

1252
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Hey, how you guys doing?

1253
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
What's up, you mother?

1254
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Happy 2006

1255
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Soon to be 2007 to you

1256
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
That's right

1257
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Now, 2006 has been a really good year

1258
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
for you guys, huh?

1259
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
It has

1260
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
We've actually kind of gone beyond

1261
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
what we thought we would do

1262
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
with this little podcast here

1263
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and we're enjoying it

1264
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Yeah, awesome

1265
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You guys just recently won

1266
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
like an Xbox award, right?

1267
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
We did

1268
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Podcast of the year

1269
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
How about that, huh?

1270
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Very cool

1271
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Congratulations, you guys

1272
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
That's awesome

1273
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Thank you

1274
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Was that something that was

1275
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
like community-based

1276
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
or was the community voted

1277
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
or was that like an editorial

1278
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
It was voted by people who

1279
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
listen to gaming podcasts, I guess

1280
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
and that's why it was important to me

1281
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It wasn't just some old fat cat guys

1282
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
in a business room somewhere

1283
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
It was actually by the people

1284
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
That's awesome

1285
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I think it always feels better

1286
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
when it's something from the community

1287
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Absolutely

1288
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
That's great

1289
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
What a compliment

1290
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
How are you going to top that in 2007?

1291
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I have no idea

1292
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
John wants to do a naked episode

1293
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
That's not going to happen

1294
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
We're going to do a musical, actually

1295
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
There you go

1296
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Wow, all right

1297
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
We'll go with that

1298
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Oh, the big musical episode, of course

1299
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
But see, that's when you know

1300
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
your shows jump the shark

1301
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So be careful

1302
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Yes, exactly

1303
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
All right, well, we've invited you

1304
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,500
guys on today to play a little game

1305
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,200
We call the year 2006 in review

1306
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,000
And what we've got, we got 13 boxes

1307
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
on the table

1308
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
And since there's two of you

1309
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Oh

1310
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
We'll let you guys each pick a box

1311
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So, ladies first, Michelle

1312
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Why don't you give me a box number

1313
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
1 through 13

1314
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
We'll take a look what's inside

1315
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I'll take number 4

1316
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
All right, box number 4

1317
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Let's have a look

1318
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
All right, the category we would

1319
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
like to know your opinion on

1320
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Best graphics in a game in 2006

1321
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
The best graphics of any game in 2006

1322
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Best graphics in a game

1323
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I have to give it to a game

1324
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I actually do not like

1325
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Gears of War

1326
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Even though I did not like the game

1327
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I was blown away by the graphics

1328
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
When I turned that on

1329
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I was like, wow, this is what

1330
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
next gen is all about

1331
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And I know we're going to probably

1332
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
have people yelling at me

1333
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
for not liking Gears of War

1334
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
But I'll get to that later

1335
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
You know what's interesting?

1336
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Not from this audience

1337
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Because we've said some very similar things

1338
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
on the program

1339
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I've said the same thing

1340
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I think the game looks great

1341
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
But I was let down by the way it played

1342
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Exactly

1343
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Well, that's a big relief

1344
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Because at our show

1345
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
We had a lot of people writing in

1346
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Like, how dare you hate this game

1347
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And you're crazy

1348
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Stop playing your Tom Clancy stuff

1349
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Tell them to sit down

1350
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
People like what they like

1351
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Exactly

1352
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Sim it down now

1353
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I liked it

1354
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
But the graphics were amazing

1355
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So that's my pick

1356
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Hey John, since you're on the line

1357
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
You want to buy into this too?

1358
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
What do you think is the best graphics?

1359
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I definitely agree with Gears of War

1360
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
The second game that comes to mind though

1361
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Is definitely I think Splinter Cell

1362
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Is a close second

1363
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Double Agent

1364
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
But yeah, Gears of War I'd say

1365
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Is definitely the best looking game

1366
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Of the year

1367
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Without a doubt

1368
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
What is it about Splinter Cell

1369
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
That makes it stand out to you?

1370
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
You know, personally I was a little

1371
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Disappointed with Splinter Cell

1372
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I thought that the multiplayer

1373
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Just was horrible

1374
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Compared to what they did in the past

1375
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I loved K.S. Theory

1376
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah, and it was a huge step backwards

1377
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
But visually, I just

1378
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I look at Sam's noggin on the screen

1379
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
With all the sweat and the detail

1380
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And the stubble

1381
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
The lighting

1382
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I just love the character models in that game

1383
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
So it definitely stands out for me

1384
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Alright, very cool

1385
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Well now, you not only have a pretty

1386
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Big category there

1387
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
But you have a really big news topic

1388
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
We want to know your opinion on for the year

1389
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Michelle

1390
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And this is a news topic that seems to be

1391
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Something that keeps going on and on and on

1392
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Throughout the year

1393
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And it's somebody we don't refer to by name

1394
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Here on this program

1395
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
But we'll call him Tack Jomson

1396
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Okay

1397
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Alright

1398
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Alright, you know this guy, right?

1399
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
He's somewhat of a bully

1400
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
In the legal sense

1401
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
And remember, he actually went to court

1402
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
To try to stop the game Bully

1403
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
On the Playstation 2

1404
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
From even coming out

1405
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
What is it about this guy, you think

1406
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Why do you think this guy keeps wanting

1407
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
To pick on us gamers?

1408
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Why won't he just leave us alone?

1409
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Well, you know, that's funny

1410
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Because a long time ago on our show

1411
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I mentioned that this kind of violence

1412
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
In video games

1413
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And I mentioned the game Bully

1414
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
And John and Kyle, the other hosts

1415
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Shot me down

1416
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
They're like, oh, nothing's become of that

1417
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And that's a fine game

1418
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
It's really not that bad

1419
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
But, you know, the angle of that

1420
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
With the school kids

1421
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And I think that that's what's really

1422
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Getting this guy going

1423
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
But to me, it's fine

1424
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I grew up playing violent video games

1425
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And I feel guilty when I kill a gnat

1426
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So I think the guy needs to back off

1427
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Well, yeah, and I kind of have an opinion

1428
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
About this

1429
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I think it all comes down to parenting

1430
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And parents and all that in general

1431
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And I think that these are just like campaign issues

1432
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
You know, I know Hillary Clinton

1433
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Kind of latched on to this

1434
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
As a campaign issue

1435
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And I think like the soccer moms

1436
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I don't want to get political here

1437
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Soccer moms

1438
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I think that there's a certain demographic

1439
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
That don't know enough about video games

1440
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And they just hear this stuff

1441
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
And they say, oh, yeah, we should get on board with this

1442
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And we should ban this too

1443
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
It's a bunch of crap, you know

1444
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And Jack Thompson doesn't know dick

1445
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
About video games

1446
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
He didn't even play Bully

1447
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
He already decided that he hates it

1448
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And really, it's probably one of Rockstar's

1449
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Tamiest titles

1450
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
You know, that's true

1451
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Is that he really seemed like

1452
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
When they let them all sit down and play the game

1453
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
He seemed kind of mad that

1454
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
They weren't showing enough of the game

1455
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Like he seemed to know all this stuff about the game

1456
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
But the game hadn't even out

1457
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
How was he able to play it?

1458
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Exactly

1459
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Very interesting

1460
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
You know, we've said a lot of the same things

1461
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
On our show here

1462
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It all comes down to the parents

1463
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
So I think it's very interesting

1464
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
We have very similar perspectives there

1465
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
But I wanted to ask real quickly too

1466
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
About the whole Hillary Clinton

1467
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And other politicians

1468
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
What do you think recently

1469
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And this is all kind of recently

1470
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
In the November, December of the year

1471
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It's kind of been the Hillary and

1472
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Who's the other guy

1473
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Lieberman

1474
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Have seemed to come out

1475
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Kind of embracing the ESRB

1476
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Like almost that there's been a change in attitude

1477
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
A little bit

1478
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
You don't trust Lieberman

1479
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I'm from Connecticut

1480
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
He ran as an independent

1481
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
So we all are like

1482
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Whoever, who cares

1483
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And first of all

1484
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I want to back up here and say

1485
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
You know

1486
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Our podcast is not political at all

1487
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yeah, we try not to go there

1488
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Because we get the mail too

1489
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
You take us down a road

1490
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
You take us down a road

1491
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
But we never go down

1492
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
You know

1493
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
We just want to have fun

1494
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
But yeah

1495
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I think this whole ESRB thing is a joke

1496
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Unless the retailers really enforce it

1497
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
It's absolutely meaningless

1498
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And I see these kids trying to buy

1499
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Grand Theft Auto all the time

1500
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
And I think most of them succeed

1501
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Some 50-year-old fat housewife at Walmart

1502
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Is going to sell the kid the game

1503
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So come on

1504
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
It's on eBay anyway

1505
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I mean these days

1506
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It's really hard to control that

1507
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
All right, all right

1508
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
We better get off this political road

1509
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Because I can see people emailing us

1510
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I don't want to go down there

1511
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
All right, all right

1512
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Then let's go to another box

1513
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
John, it's your turn

1514
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Go and pick a box

1515
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
1 through 12 now

1516
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I'll link to 12

1517
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
How about 7?

1518
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
All right, box number 7

1519
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Let's take a look

1520
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Most hilarious video game of 2006

1521
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Oh

1522
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Most hilarious

1523
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Okay, that's easy for me

1524
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It's actually Rayman Raving Rabbids

1525
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Whatever the hell it is

1526
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
It's Rayman Raving Rabbids on the Wii

1527
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Yeah, definitely

1528
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
That game is off the wall crazy

1529
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
So it's one of those laugh-out

1530
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I have to be honest

1531
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I personally haven't played this a whole lot

1532
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
But I did notice it was somewhat quirky

1533
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
When I took a look at it

1534
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It's very quirky

1535
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
What is it about the game that makes it so funny?

1536
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
You know, it's just got this twisted art direction

1537
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Which I kind of appreciate

1538
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
They really create these little mutant-looking

1539
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Rabbit characters

1540
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
And you just kind of throw it in this little rabbit world

1541
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And it's just very bizarre

1542
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
And it's funny, you know

1543
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
And I think that's all it is

1544
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
That's all I can say

1545
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
All right, very cool

1546
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Michelle, would you agree

1547
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Or do you have a different pick?

1548
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
For me, I don't know if this is on the console or anything

1549
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I'm going to have to go with OfficialLineWriter.com

1550
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
What?

1551
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Yes

1552
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
It's a little web game

1553
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Of this guy that's on a sled

1554
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And he goes flying around

1555
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And I laughed for like an hour

1556
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
When I first played this game

1557
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Well, you're simple

1558
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
We'll take it

1559
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
It's PC gaming

1560
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
We'll take it

1561
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It's a little PC game

1562
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I'm telling you

1563
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
It's a gem

1564
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Try it out and you'll get a good laugh

1565
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
All right, awesome

1566
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Yeah, you know

1567
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I was trying to pull up LineWriter on the Wii

1568
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
When the browser came out

1569
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
But now, I guess since they're going to make it an official game

1570
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
They locked everybody out

1571
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Yeah, I can't wait for that

1572
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah, it's a Flash issue

1573
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Because the Wii only supports Flash 7 or older

1574
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
And that's like in Flash 9 or something

1575
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Oh, we had thought that they shut people out

1576
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Because they're going to be releasing the full version later on

1577
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
As a game

1578
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Yeah, it's a newer Flash version

1579
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Yep

1580
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
All right, and here's the story I'd like to ask you about

1581
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
This is a little bit dated

1582
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
This kind of goes back to way early in the year

1583
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
But I don't remember if you remember all the furor that went on

1584
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
When Microsoft announced that they were going to be creating this new system

1585
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Called the Origami

1586
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And for about a month, people were running wild

1587
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Like, oh my gosh

1588
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Microsoft's going to enter the handheld market

1589
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
They're going to obliterate the PSP and the DS

1590
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And da da da

1591
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And then it turns out the Origami is just pretty much this fancy schmancy PC

1592
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
And that's why the screenshot of Halo was on it

1593
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,000
So this kind of bears the question about Microsoft entering the handheld market

1594
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Is this something Microsoft ought to consider in 2007?

1595
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Yes

1596
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I would definitely say so

1597
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
You know, I'm a Nintendo fanboy

1598
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
The DSLY has sold like 34 million units

1599
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Compared to the PSP, which is like 18 million

1600
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You know, Nintendo owns that category

1601
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And I think that there's definitely a need still

1602
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
For a portable for an older market

1603
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
You know, the Nintendo kind of is young and skews a little bit older

1604
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
But not too old

1605
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And I think that Microsoft, it's ripe for the taking

1606
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Because they have the installed user base of the 360

1607
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And yes, I think they should definitely do it

1608
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Are you saying you want to have a dead or alive extreme volleyball on the go, basically?

1609
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
No, I think that Microsoft's bigger plan though

1610
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Is like to integrate the Xbox Live market into the handheld

1611
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
So I think that's where the magic's going to be

1612
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Where you can download movies or music or games

1613
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
And then carry them with you in this portable device

1614
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Do you think that's something they might end up trying to do with Zune

1615
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Because of the iPod games and everything?

1616
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I do think that

1617
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Because the thing about the Xbox is that you can download movies now

1618
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
No music is around the corner

1619
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
The thing is you can't get it off the console

1620
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
You can't take it with you

1621
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So some device is going to enable that

1622
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Be it the Zune or this other device that comes

1623
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So I think that's all part of the big picture

1624
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I definitely do

1625
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Michelle, what are your thoughts?

1626
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Microsoft, do they need a handheld?

1627
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I think they should really get into it

1628
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Because although the Nintendo DS is very cool

1629
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I do not like playing multiplayer on it

1630
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Because of the little friend code thing

1631
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Now one thing Microsoft does and does well

1632
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Is the Xbox Live community

1633
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And if they could get that on a handheld

1634
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I would definitely pick it up

1635
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Because to be able to just get up and go

1636
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And play with your friends no matter where you are

1637
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
That's something that the DS just doesn't have

1638
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
If you remember the DS didn't even get online

1639
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
For about a year and a half

1640
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Yep, exactly

1641
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I agree with you there

1642
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
That Xbox definitely knows what they're doing

1643
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
When it comes to the online stuff

1644
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Very good

1645
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
One more question for you guys

1646
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Actually two, it's a two-parter

1647
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
We want to know, because we're taking a tally all day long

1648
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
What do you guys believe is the best game of 2006?

1649
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Michelle, we'll start with you

1650
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Michelle, what do you think is the best game of 2006?

1651
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
For multiplayer, I'm going to give it to Rainbow Six Vegas

1652
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
But I want to talk about single player

1653
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Because to me, I was not into single player games

1654
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Until this game came along

1655
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
It's oblivion

1656
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I've spent countless hours

1657
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
And I haven't played the game twice

1658
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Everybody I ever talked to kind of liked the game

1659
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Except for people who didn't have time for it

1660
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
So it seemed to have something for everyone

1661
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Worst game, do you want me to go right into?

1662
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Sure, why not?

1663
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
We'll take your worst game

1664
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
What do you think, Michelle?

1665
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Although there were worst games

1666
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
It's going to be Gears of War because I had the most hype

1667
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Come on!

1668
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Yes, because I wanted that to be good

1669
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Because it had the capability to be good

1670
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
And it just wasn't

1671
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
So that was the biggest letdown for me

1672
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
And that's why I gave it to the worst game

1673
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
That is a gutsy, gutsy statement

1674
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
It's a gutsy thing, everybody bring it on

1675
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
You want to give out your email address, your gamertag?

1676
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Oh God, you can find us at videogameoutsiders.com

1677
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Oh, there you go

1678
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Orange Lines Radio

1679
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
All right, all right

1680
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
You know what, I would actually agree

1681
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I named Gears of War at E3

1682
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I said next to Spore, it was the game I was anticipating the most

1683
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Walking out of the doors of E3

1684
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Because when I looked at E3, I thought

1685
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Boy, the cover seems so neat

1686
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
How one button will do all this stuff

1687
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
But then when I actually sat down and played it

1688
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I was like, ugh, I don't like this

1689
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I want to just run out there and start shooting people

1690
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Like Quake or Halo

1691
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
All right, John, what do you think was the best game of 2006?

1692
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Well, my favorite game by far this year

1693
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
So far is Zelda for the Wii, Twilight Princess

1694
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Definitely the best single-player game of the year

1695
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
It's just absolutely immersive

1696
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
The art direction, the plot, everything about it

1697
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I just absolutely love, it's what I live for

1698
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And then my favorite multiplayer game, I agree with Michelle

1699
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,000
It's Rainbow Six Vegas with a close second Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

1700
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Because I think at the end of the day

1701
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
That's the game I probably played the most this year is Ghost Recon

1702
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
All right, interesting

1703
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
All right, so we'll put you down for

1704
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
It sounds like you're very passionate about the Zelda

1705
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
So we'll put that down as the single-player game

1706
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Yes, very much so

1707
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Yeah, I would say so

1708
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Worst game, you want to hear my totem ball?

1709
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
What the hell is that?

1710
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I wonder when someone was going to go to the Xbox Live

1711
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And some of their questionable picks this year

1712
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
So even though the game was free

1713
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
You still say it's not worth being free

1714
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Yes, it was an embarrassment to Xbox Live

1715
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
You know, what is it about camera games anyway?

1716
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Everybody seems to want to do camera games

1717
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
But it seems to me like no one's done it right

1718
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Well the iToy, the Sony iToy was pretty successful though

1719
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It was successful, but how fun was it really?

1720
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I know, exactly

1721
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Fun for like an hour and then it kind of, I don't know, the thrill is lost

1722
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It's a novelty

1723
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Well hey, best of luck to you guys in 2007

1724
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Tell our listeners really quick who may not be familiar with your program

1725
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Tell them a little bit about your show

1726
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
We have a really stupid podcast

1727
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
No stop

1728
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Basically we have a very relaxed kind of podcast

1729
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
In the atmosphere if you're just kind of talking with your friends

1730
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
We're not game experts, we're not in the industry

1731
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And we have a really great forum and community

1732
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
And I think that's what makes our show so great as well

1733
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Yeah, we have awesome listeners

1734
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And there's actually a third host who's not here

1735
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Kyle Jones, and he's Canadian

1736
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Yes, he's our resident Canadian

1737
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
So check us out, videogameoutsiders.com

1738
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
We have a forum, you can download the episodes and all that

1739
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Show archives, blah blah blah

1740
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Videogameoutsiders.com

1741
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Alright, very cool

1742
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Check that out you guys, it's videogameoutsiders.com

1743
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Congratulations to you guys on an awesome 2006

1744
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Thanks for coming on our program tonight

1745
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
We appreciate it

1746
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Thanks for having us

1747
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
And we'll see you in 2007

1748
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Happy New Year

1749
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
We definitely want to thank John and Michelle

1750
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
For coming on from Video Game Outsiders

1751
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
You know, that was one of those people that we contacted

1752
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
We really didn't know them

1753
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
But we just kind of thought we'd get along with them

1754
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Just because, hey, you know, it's two guys and a girl

1755
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
That do their show, and they all met through a gaming community

1756
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And we know some of our listeners are in common

1757
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
So it was very cool of them to come on

1758
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Without really maybe knowing who we were

1759
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I don't know if they knew beforehand or what

1760
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
So it was just very cool

1761
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
And I gotta say, that Michelle, she's got some pretty big balls

1762
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Naming Gears of War the worst game of the year

1763
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Well, I mean, it was kind of a disappointment sometimes

1764
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
But maybe I need to play it more

1765
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I know it's fucking hard, though

1766
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
All my coworkers that bought that game said

1767
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
My God, this game is so fucking hard

1768
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I'm playing it on easy, and I can't fucking pass

1769
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
To the goddamn beginning of the game

1770
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
No, I mean, I can't say I disagree with her

1771
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I don't know if I would have called it the worst game of the year

1772
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
But definitely one of the biggest disappointments

1773
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
For me, personally

1774
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
You know what, I'm gonna go on the record saying

1775
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I think the best game of next year is gonna be Earth Defense Force 2017

1776
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
What?

1777
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
It's the same game, you're fighting giant ants and robots and stuff

1778
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Okay, maybe it's not the best game, but it's a game I want

1779
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Alright, well, thanks again to those guys over at VideoGameOutsiders.com

1780
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
They just released the whole Simple 2000 series over here

1781
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
That'd be fun

1782
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Alright, you're looking at this whole other world right now, Logie

1783
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So?

1784
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
As usual

1785
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Alright, who's our next interview?

1786
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Our next one is Brad from PodCulture

1787
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
And I'm joined here by Brad from PodCulture

1788
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Welcome to the program, Brad, how you doing?

1789
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Beachy King

1790
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Hey, now this is a little different because PodCulture

1791
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Not exactly exclusively a games podcast

1792
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
But you're still a games fan, yes?

1793
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Oh yeah

1794
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
What kind of stuff do you talk about over there on PodCulture for those that don't know?

1795
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Basically just geek life

1796
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
You know, it's me, a friend of mine I've known for I guess almost 20 years now

1797
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:49,000
And my girlfriend and the three of us just sit around and talk about what TV we're watching

1798
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
What games we're playing, what movies we're watching

1799
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
That kind of stuff

1800
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Sounds just like what we do here, but a little more geeky

1801
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
More in the pop culture business, I guess

1802
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Nothing wrong with that

1803
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Well, thanks for coming on the show today, Brad, and we want to play a little game with you

1804
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And it's called The Year 2006 in Review

1805
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,000
So we have 11 boxes left, why don't you pick one of those boxes, 1 through 11

1806
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
We'll open it up and see what's inside

1807
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Number 9

1808
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Alright, number 9, here we go

1809
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:31,000
The best puzzle game of 2006, are you a big puzzle game fan?

1810
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I like some of them, yeah

1811
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Well, did you have a particular favorite that you would call the best puzzle game of 2006?

1812
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Well, I don't know if it came out in 2006, but I started playing it in 2006

1813
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
We'll take it

1814
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Astro Pop

1815
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Astro Pop, I believe technically that was a release this year, so on Xbox Live Arcade

1816
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Yeah

1817
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Interesting choice, because some of those PopCap games, some folks say they don't belong on Xbox Live

1818
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
What is it about the Astro Pop game that you like so much?

1819
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Well, I have ADD when it comes to games, so when it comes to trying to play something for a long time

1820
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I kind of lose interest in it a lot

1821
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
So, you know, you can pick that up and just run with it

1822
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So, Astro Pop is one of those games that you really sit down and you only play it for a little while at a time

1823
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Mm-hmm

1824
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Alright, gotcha, okay, I can understand

1825
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Well, as we say, there are no right or wrong answers, it's your opinion

1826
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
So there you have it, Astro Pop for best puzzle game

1827
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Aren't those achievements a pain in the butt, though, on Xbox Live? I don't think I have any of them

1828
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I haven't gotten any on Astro Pop

1829
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
That's a tough game

1830
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Alright, well, we also want to know your opinion on a particular news topic

1831
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And the one we have in box number 9 is the PlayStation 3 line versus the Wii line

1832
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Of course, in November, big, big console launches

1833
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
And you hear about this violent outbreak

1834
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I think there was this comic that put it so well is that there was this violent outbreak going on in the PlayStation 3 lines

1835
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Where people were getting shot and pushed into telephone poles

1836
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
And then you go to the Wii line and it's like people are wearing buttons that say free hugs

1837
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And it's just, you know, kumbaya and everything

1838
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Why do you think there was such the radical difference between the two lines this year?

1839
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I don't know if it's just that Nintendo is more of a fun system versus the hardcore gamers on the P3 or what

1840
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I really don't know

1841
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Nintendo has always had more of a fun thing around their system

1842
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:38,000
It's been less hardcore gamers than the PlayStation has been, at least to me anyway

1843
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,000
So you think maybe when you say it's more fun, maybe the fact that there were more people in the Wii line

1844
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
That were really dedicated and you knew that those people were going to be playing the Wii

1845
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Versus, you know, the eBaying that they say was going on in the PlayStation 3 line

1846
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Where half those people were camping to put it on eBay

1847
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Yeah, and you're looking at it where the system costs half as much too

1848
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,000
More people are going to be able to afford to buy that to play

1849
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:11,000
And, you know, it's more of a status symbol in a lot of ways

1850
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
You know, I've got a PlayStation 3 that are rare

1851
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
You know, it's hard to get a Wii, sure, but it's a lot harder to get a P3

1852
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I can agree with the status symbol thing

1853
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Because I think the media kind of made it to look like the PlayStation 3 was kind of this, you know, big status symbol

1854
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Especially, you know, when they were covering the lines and everything

1855
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
So do you think some of that might have to do with the fact that the PlayStation 3 came out first?

1856
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
You're only talking a couple of days there, really

1857
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I guess that's true

1858
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
It was, what, a week, maybe a week, a couple of days

1859
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
About like four days, yeah

1860
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I guess that's true

1861
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
All right, well, hey, just out of curiosity, did you end up waiting in line for one of these systems?

1862
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:52,000
No, I've never been a get-it-at-the-moment kind of guy

1863
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:58,000
It's only been within the past four or six months that I've even got an Xbox 360

1864
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
So you're going to wait this little war out and see what happens, huh?

1865
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Yeah, I didn't feel like fighting the crazy lines to get a Wii

1866
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I thought about getting a Wii, but I kind of looked around and then the day they went on sale I had to work anyway

1867
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And by the time I got off, everybody had sold them all out at the Target

1868
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Do you think if there wasn't all this craziness around the Wii still that you might have one right now?

1869
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
If I had 250 bucks, yeah, you betcha I'd have one

1870
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I guess this is the wrong time of year to be asking right after Christmas

1871
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Oh, yeah

1872
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
All right, well, thanks so much for your opinion

1873
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
We want to get your opinion on a couple more things here real quick

1874
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:43,000
We also want to know, we're taking a poll all night long, what do you believe was the best video game of 2006

1875
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
In your opinion, using whatever criteria you want

1876
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:52,000
The best video game that I've gotten, and this is kind of weird because it conflicts with my ADDN games

1877
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
But Phantasy Star Universe, I've loved that whole series

1878
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
And I picked that up because I love the Dreamcast version and all that

1879
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And I picked up PSU and I've had a blast with that

1880
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Are you playing more the single player or more the online in that game?

1881
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
About 50-50, maybe a little more online

1882
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
This game was a little bit, I think, overlooked

1883
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I agree that Phantasy Star Universe is actually a much better title than I think a lot of people are giving it credit for

1884
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
In my opinion

1885
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I think part of the reason people are overlooking it is because it came out right around the same time that you had Final Fantasy XII

1886
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
A real powerhouse RPG on Sony's PlayStation

1887
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Do you think people are overlooking this game?

1888
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Well, as far as I can remember, Phantasy Star hasn't been the big blowout

1889
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Hadn't had the fanboy following maybe that Final Fantasy has

1890
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:56,000
What is it about Phantasy Star Universe that appeals you to that game as opposed to a game like Final Fantasy XII?

1891
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Well, having never played any of the Final Fantasy games

1892
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I create my own character, I go through it

1893
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It doesn't seem to be as complex

1894
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Or at least Phantasy Star Online didn't seem to be as complex

1895
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Now Phantasy Star Universe has a little more depth to it than the other version

1896
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I can see that

1897
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Where Phantasy Star Universe and Phantasy Star Online especially were a little more action oriented

1898
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
You actually use the weapons, like you press a button to swing the weapon

1899
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Whereas Final Fantasy was always a little more weight, cast magic

1900
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
It was a little more think about it in advance type thing

1901
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Think and then act as opposed to having to react to Phantasy Star Universe

1902
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Exactly

1903
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
What would you say would be the worst game that you played in 2006?

1904
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
The worst game

1905
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,000
It's weird because it's a fun game but it's the worst controls

1906
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Is Sneak King

1907
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Oh, Sneak King, worst game, why did you say Sneak King?

1908
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Because it's hard as hell to control that damn thing, at least to me

1909
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
So even for four bucks it's too much, you think?

1910
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Four bucks is four bucks, that's not that big of a deal

1911
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
But it's hard as hell to just control it

1912
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Do you think it was a little bit of a throwaway title just because of the commercial tie-in

1913
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
That maybe the people who developed it thought, it's a four dollar game

1914
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
We don't need to

1915
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Oh, exactly

1916
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Alright, so I guess the quality showed up there in the end

1917
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Alright, well thank you for sharing your opinion with us there

1918
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
So we got Phantasy Star Universe and Sneak King for best and worst of 2006

1919
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
And we'll tally it up throughout the night and see where we end up

1920
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Brad, what are your plans for 2007 with Pod Culture?

1921
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Just going to kind of keep on doing the same old, same old

1922
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Or any big things coming up for 2007?

1923
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
We've tweaked the format a little bit

1924
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
We're starting to go weekly rather than bi-weekly

1925
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
With the show and who knows what lies in the future

1926
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Trying to get the word out and getting some more people listening to the show

1927
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Awesome, well get the word out right now

1928
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Tell them how they can tune into Pod Culture for some more geek and sci-fi chat

1929
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Be over at PodCulture.net

1930
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Alright

1931
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
And there's three or four different ways to subscribe to it

1932
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Got an iTunes link, ODO

1933
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And just the regular RSS feed

1934
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And we're listed on Dig and Pop Current and all that fun stuff

1935
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Alright, go give them a dig, PodCulture.net

1936
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Brad, thanks so much for coming and joining us on the show

1937
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I know you've been a longtime listener of Orange Lounge

1938
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And we appreciate the support

1939
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And we're glad to have you on to support your independent program as well

1940
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Thank you very much

1941
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Especially when you're looking at sales trends and what system is ultimately gonna be victorious

1942
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
It's not going to be just the system that appeals to the hardcore gamer

1943
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
But everybody in between from casual gamer on to maybe a mid-level

1944
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Yeah, I like video games a little bit type thing

1945
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,000
So, big thanks to Brad for coming on and sharing his perspective on the best puzzle game

1946
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
In the PlayStation 3 line and the Wii line

1947
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
You know what the Wii needs to, what market they need to tap

1948
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Is the old people that go to the casino market

1949
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
And you can get some games that they can actually gamble and win money

1950
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Ah, that's a lot of money right there for you

1951
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
You could actually use the Wii controller to pull a slot on a machine

1952
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Exactly

1953
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I mean, World Series of Poker are tournament champions for the Wiis

1954
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
And they honestly have that game out there

1955
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
And how it uses the controller is beyond me

1956
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:58,000
But I'm thinking there's a lot of people that shuffle into a bus and go to a casino

1957
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
If you can bring that experience home

1958
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
You know, maybe have the Wii puff out some cigarette smoke

1959
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Maybe that's that hidden feature of the Wii no one knows about yet

1960
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
It'll blow smoke in your face

1961
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
You are so strange

1962
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Alright, anyway, we're going to take a little detour here

1963
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Because we're going to bring on some more people in segment B of our show

1964
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,000
But first, it would not be an episode of Orange Launch Radio

1965
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
If we did not have our very own Dark Sakura

1966
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Providing us with her perspective

1967
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
From when she surfs up the web, up, down, left

1968
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I mean, that's all she does at work all day, is surf the web

1969
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
So she's finding the website for you

1970
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
What she believes is the website of the week

1971
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week?

1972
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I blame you for this, Rob

1973
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I blame you for this, it's so hardcore

1974
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:56,000
This site of the week is one that Rob turned me onto

1975
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
It's the Katerday Live Journal Community

1976
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Which I've been looking over

1977
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
And yeah, I love Katerday

1978
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
The only reason I still really go to 4chan anymore is for Katerday

1979
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,000
So this one is community.livejournal.com slash Katerday

1980
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
C-A-T-E-U-R-D-A-Y

1981
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
And I'm looking at one right now that has a cat with one of those frilly head things

1982
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And a little wand that says

1983
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Be in your fairy kitty, plot in your death for this

1984
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Fantastic

1985
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I'm thinking in 2007 we ought to just change the name of the segment to

1986
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Dark Sakura's cat picture site of the week

1987
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
No, no, no

1988
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Because that's all you ever pick

1989
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
No, no, no, no, no, because I also picked Dr. Who's site

1990
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
God forbid they come out with a cat Dr. Who site

1991
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Or Dr. Who gets a little cat companion

1992
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
No, because he doesn't like cats

1993
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Well, what a bastard

1994
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
But I got to say though, in all honesty, you know, you may think

1995
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Jamie's a little weird for her Dr. Who obsession

1996
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
But she finally did her best to make me a Dr. Who fan this week

1997
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
And it's actually kind of working

1998
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
We've been watching season one and we're, what, like five episodes in

1999
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
And I actually really enjoy it

2000
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
It's a really good show

2001
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
It really is good

2002
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
We're actually more than that

2003
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
We're on the third disc

2004
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
So we're on the seventh episode in

2005
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Oh dang

2006
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I'm loving it

2007
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I think it's a great show

2008
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I can't wait to get to season two

2009
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
This is my favorite episode for the first season

2010
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
The Daleks

2011
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Exterminate

2012
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
It was good, it was good

2013
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
They should make a video game out of that

2014
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
They actually have made Dr. Who video games

2015
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Yeah, but like a new one

2016
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Because it's all a, you know, new resurgence of Dr. Who

2017
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
So they need new Dr. Who games, I think

2018
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
We need to shoot the Cybermen the game

2019
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Well, we're getting what?

2020
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I heard we're getting a Battlestar Galactica MMO on 360

2021
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
We're getting, you know, the, what else were they making?

2022
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
A Firefly

2023
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
You can't do a Dr. Who MMO

2024
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
It doesn't have to be an MMO

2025
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I don't care if it's an MMO or not

2026
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Make a good, good platformer, good TV tie-in game

2027
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Well, Rob also showed me another show that made me giggle

2028
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,000
He showed me the BBC Queer as Folk

2029
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Yes, because it was actually written by the same guy who did Dr. Who

2030
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
And, well, the new series, anyway

2031
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
And it made me just crack up

2032
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
When the one person watched by teasing one of the main characters

2033
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Going ex-star-men-a

2034
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I was like, yeah

2035
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I have a sonic screwdriver now that I left it at home

2036
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
You know the reason why I love the British version of Queer as Folk

2037
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Is I have a total crush on Vince

2038
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Who is the nerdy, nerdy one there

2039
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I don't like the other guy

2040
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I know, he's a, he's a

2041
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Do it, do it

2042
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Do it

2043
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Alright, anyway

2044
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
But I gotta say that I like the BBC Queer as Folk more than the American one

2045
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Because it's more compa-

2046
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Like, it was over in, like, eight episodes

2047
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Which is better

2048
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I've only seen one episode of the US one

2049
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
And that was with the lesbians getting married

2050
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Aww, isn't that sweet

2051
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Anyway, before this show gets any gayer

2052
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
We better take a break

2053
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:46,000
And we'll be back here on Orange Lounge Radio Part B to talk more about the year in review

2054
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Stay tuned, we have Travis Donovan from Travis Donovan Live coming on

2055
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
We have some folks from Destructoid.com

2056
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
We love that blog

2057
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
And Gamertag Radio getting some representation up in Part B

2058
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Stay tuned, we'll be back after this

2059
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights

2060
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
And is podcasted to the world twice a week

2061
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Stay tuned to our podcast feed

2062
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,000
For the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
