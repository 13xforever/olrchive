The opinions rendered herein are those of the guests, not necessarily those of the guests,

00:35.120 --> 00:39.840
girls do when they go to LA. I know she's been making a lot of LJ posts, which by the

00:39.840 --> 00:44.040
way reminds me to pimp the LiveJournal community. It's a good time. We have a lot of people

00:44.040 --> 00:48.560
there and we like to post show updates and sometimes there will be random discussion

00:48.560 --> 00:53.220
threads as well. Check it out if you're a LiveJournal user. Orange Lounge is our name

00:53.220 --> 01:00.220
on LiveJournal. Also, we have a MySpace. MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Give me more friends.

01:00.740 --> 01:04.980
We want more friends. And by the way, clips of old shows are also on there and sometimes

01:04.980 --> 01:10.100
we post announcements as bulletins and fun things like that. We won't spam you too much

01:10.100 --> 01:15.660
on MySpace, we promise. We used to post little pictures when people would add us, like of

01:15.660 --> 01:19.420
little game-related things. We'll probably get back into doing that pretty soon, so maybe

01:19.420 --> 01:25.320
give people incentive to add us because we'll comment on you. The only people that have

01:25.320 --> 01:28.600
a login for that are myself, Loki, and DarkSakura, so you know if you get that, it's one of us

01:28.600 --> 01:35.300
doing it. So, add us on MySpace. It's fun. Yes. Do that or we'll kill the ferret. Anyway,

01:35.300 --> 01:42.300
let's get back into some news. Anyways, so this one website, reghardware.co.uk, is saying

01:44.240 --> 01:51.260
that Sony is going to ship a major PS3 firmware update in March. And what will it contain?

01:51.260 --> 01:58.260
We don't know. But last, SC Europe VP of Technology, Paul Holman, cited by an Australian website,

02:00.420 --> 02:06.860
Smart House, said, new features and new gaming capabilities. Well, that could be anything.

02:06.860 --> 02:13.060
God damn people. You know, actually, you know, it's only bad enough that we report on this

02:13.060 --> 02:17.820
because it's someone reporting on someone else reporting on something else saying, there

02:17.820 --> 02:24.820
will be new things coming. Where is equally the blame? I guess there's not too much to

02:25.260 --> 02:29.140
be surprised here. What I think is interesting about this story is that if they do release

02:29.140 --> 02:33.540
a big firmware update in March, then it looks like they might be kind of mirroring a little

02:33.540 --> 02:37.700
bit what the 360 is doing with their biannual updates, right? Because they have to do the

02:37.700 --> 02:40.980
fall update and the spring update, at least that's what they promise. And I believe they

02:40.980 --> 02:44.900
were doing that on the old school Xbox as well, so this would, you know, kind of line

02:44.900 --> 02:51.460
up with that. It makes sense. One of the rumors, because one of the stories ran, was that it

02:51.460 --> 02:58.460
would be the 1080i fix. And, well, we know that's not the case because they already released

02:59.420 --> 03:06.420
that. Alright, well, you know, if this whole PlayStation 3 thing is just not for you, this

03:07.780 --> 03:13.540
blogger over at 3dgamer.blogspot.com posted this big list of things you could do instead

03:13.540 --> 03:19.320
of buying a PlayStation 3. You could fly to London. You could pay your rent for a month.

03:19.320 --> 03:26.320
You could buy 300 Big Macs or 3,000 bandages. You could buy 60 large cheese pizzas, 250

03:26.620 --> 03:32.340
gallons of gas. You could buy a 1988 Mazda 323. I guess that's the Blue Book value of

03:32.340 --> 03:36.540
it. You could buy 15 shares of Sony Corps, though that might not be the best idea right

03:36.540 --> 03:42.440
now. You could take a skydiving course and do four jumps. You could get a personal trainer

03:42.440 --> 03:49.440
and do 17 sessions at the gym. You could buy 225 pounds of canned tuna. Or, and it ends

03:50.140 --> 03:55.060
here on a nice on note, you could provide food, shelter, and clothing for two children

03:55.060 --> 04:01.300
for an entire year and have $150 left over for something nice for yourself. What this

04:01.300 --> 04:06.460
doesn't address are the eBay profiteers, though. They don't factor that in. So, I think they

04:06.460 --> 04:11.180
should have said, you know, all these eBay profiteers are stealing from the poor, defenseless

04:11.180 --> 04:15.140
children who have no roof over their head, you bastards.

04:15.140 --> 04:16.140
Think of the children.

04:16.140 --> 04:19.180
I know. Why isn't anyone thinking of the children?

04:19.180 --> 04:25.140
But can you play Resistance on 225 pounds of tuna? I think not. At least that's what

04:25.140 --> 04:26.140
Sony would tell you.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.140
Anywho...

04:27.140 --> 04:32.140
You can't play Ridge Racer with 30 years' worth of toothpaste.

04:32.140 --> 04:39.140
Oh, anyways. Well, definitely time for some wonderful street dates, as always. And I like

04:39.140 --> 04:45.480
to start things off, like we normally do, with some exclusive street dates that you

04:45.480 --> 04:48.440
probably haven't heard from any place else.

04:48.440 --> 04:52.920
So let's get going here. Now, there's a few stories that came out this week with games

04:52.920 --> 04:59.120
that are coming out. One of those, of course, is D3's Simple 2000 series game for the 360

04:59.120 --> 05:05.560
called Earth Defense Force X. And that's coming out on the 360 in the United States on March

05:05.560 --> 05:10.840
21st. And it's only going to be retailing for $39.99. So not bad. I'm glad they're actually

05:10.840 --> 05:13.120
bringing out some cool games like that.

05:13.120 --> 05:20.120
One game that we saw a little bit about, I think last month, was Def Jam Icon. It will

05:20.360 --> 05:26.960
be coming out on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 on March 7th. March is, of course, a big

05:26.960 --> 05:30.400
month for gaming beyond November here.

05:30.400 --> 05:35.440
Of course, around the same time, we're also going to be getting Godfather on the PlayStation

05:35.440 --> 05:42.440
3. Yay, a game that's over a year old now. And Godfather the game on the Wii. Now, that

05:42.800 --> 05:45.720
hasn't been said anywhere yet. That'll be interesting.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.720
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Godfather on the Wii?

05:48.720 --> 05:50.440
Godfather on the Wii.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.040
The fuck?

05:51.040 --> 05:55.920
That'll be fun. I can't wait to play it.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.080
I mean, you're going to get to bitch-slap someone with a controller and it'll, like,

05:59.080 --> 06:00.040
actually work?

06:00.040 --> 06:00.440
I think so.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.600
That might be kind of fun, actually. They really do need Grand Theft Auto on the Wii,

06:03.600 --> 06:04.080
don't they?

06:04.080 --> 06:04.880
Oh, I can't wait.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.200
I want to, you know, be able to pull the hooker out of the car, like, in the real motion,

06:08.200 --> 06:09.200
and then, you know, bitch-slap her.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.960
Anyways, Rainbow Six-

06:11.960 --> 06:12.480
Rated M.

06:12.480 --> 06:17.760
Rainbow Six Vegas for the PlayStation 3. One of those wonderful launch titles delayed to

06:17.760 --> 06:24.760
March 14th. Co-PlayStation 3. A little bit, you know, more difficult to develop for, apparently,

06:26.360 --> 06:32.240
than we thought. Sonic the Hedgehog also delayed on the PlayStation 3 until January 17th.

06:32.240 --> 06:36.160
Oh, are they going to make the game fun?

06:36.160 --> 06:37.200
Probably not.

06:37.200 --> 06:43.160
SSX Blur, which is going to be coming out on the Wii, also coming out in March on March

06:43.160 --> 06:47.480
14th, and that would look pretty cool. I can't wait. They've cheapified it a little bit,

06:47.480 --> 06:48.400
and it looks pretty fun.

06:48.400 --> 06:52.720
I like the cute little video I think you played on our pre-tape show last week. It looked

06:52.720 --> 06:53.440
pretty cute.

06:53.440 --> 06:54.480
Yeah.

06:54.480 --> 07:00.440
Some other stuff. Forza 2 has been delayed until May 16th of next year. Yay.

07:00.440 --> 07:04.920
There's some new DS games coming out, including Theme Park, which I think was announced this

07:04.920 --> 07:10.760
week. That's coming out March 21st, 2007. And another game called Pogo Island, which

07:10.760 --> 07:12.920
is coming out on March 27th.

07:12.920 --> 07:18.920
Finally, Stranglehold, another launch game that was supposedly coming out on the PlayStation

07:18.920 --> 07:21.760
3, delayed to June 1st of next year.

07:21.760 --> 07:27.080
Sid Meier's Pirates on the PlayStation Portable is going to be coming out February 26th. This

07:27.080 --> 07:32.480
one, as I teased on the Wednesday show, Charlie Brown All Stars for PlayStation 2 coming out

07:32.480 --> 07:33.640
March 28th.

07:33.640 --> 07:34.640
Rad.

07:34.640 --> 07:41.080
And then finally, Silent Hill Origins, such an interesting game on the PS3, delayed all

07:41.080 --> 07:42.480
the way to April 25th.

07:42.480 --> 07:47.600
Hmm. Interesting. But of course, dates are subject to change, as they always are. And

07:47.600 --> 07:51.000
one thing I wanted to ask you about, actually, this wasn't anywhere on the show world, but

07:51.000 --> 07:55.040
something we put on OrangeOnTrader.com earlier this week is that folks have been spotted

07:55.040 --> 08:01.240
on the internet playing DDR Universe on Xbox Live, which would indicate that the game has

08:01.240 --> 08:06.160
gone gold, I would believe, or else the achievements and things would not be loaded on Xbox's servers

08:06.160 --> 08:09.640
so that we could find them. So, March still?

08:09.640 --> 08:10.640
So, March.

08:10.640 --> 08:14.320
Are you sure? Because if the game's gone gold, don't you think this will make the January

08:14.320 --> 08:15.320
date?

08:15.320 --> 08:16.320
No.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.320
All right.

08:17.320 --> 08:18.320
Still positive it's in March.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.840
Why? What makes you so damn sure?

08:19.840 --> 08:23.320
Their January game is, or actually, they don't have a game in January.

08:23.320 --> 08:24.320
Well, there you go.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.320
February.

08:25.320 --> 08:26.320
No.

08:26.320 --> 08:31.640
Okay, they have games coming out in January. They have Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, I want to say, Tag

08:31.640 --> 08:35.680
Force is coming out, and then, I don't think anything else.

08:35.680 --> 08:38.160
Yeah, well, what if you go to work tomorrow and then, oop, the date got shifted. They

08:38.160 --> 08:39.160
bumped it up.

08:39.160 --> 08:43.360
They normally don't bump stuff up. I'm thinking they're waiting until March. March is the

08:43.360 --> 08:50.040
big dates, you know, for games. It's the second push of the, or I guess, the first push of

08:50.040 --> 08:58.520
the year, other than November. So, it's still going to stick to March. You'll see. You'll

08:58.520 --> 08:59.520
see.

08:59.520 --> 09:00.520
We will.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.520
We will.

09:01.520 --> 09:02.520
We will.

09:02.520 --> 09:03.520
We will.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.520
We will.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.520
So, we shall see.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.880
And just because they're playing it online, hey, remember, Pimps at Sea is online right

09:07.880 --> 09:08.880
now. Does that mean he'll...

09:08.880 --> 09:12.960
But you couldn't go in and see, like, the little graphics and all the achievements and

09:12.960 --> 09:15.880
everything. Those weren't loaded on Xbox's servers. You couldn't do anything with that.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.920
It just showed that they were playing Pimps at Sea. But with DDR Universe, that's how

09:18.920 --> 09:20.200
we were able to get all the achievements.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.200
So, it doesn't mean anything.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.600
Oh, we'll see.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.600
We will see.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.600
We will see.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.600
MF'er.

09:27.600 --> 09:33.400
Let's go to our buddies over in the UK. Since Dark Sakura is not here this week, I'm filling

09:33.400 --> 09:38.040
in with some dates that you will be getting some new games. Of course, things are starting

09:38.040 --> 09:42.560
to slow down a little bit since it is getting towards the end of the year. But you do have

09:42.560 --> 09:47.840
a few games coming out the week of the 15th, including Cats and Dogs 2006. Those are two

09:47.840 --> 09:51.120
separate games, Cats and Dogs 2006.

09:51.120 --> 09:55.520
Hamsters is also coming out on the DS, so that should be fun. Star Wars Lethal Alliance

09:55.520 --> 09:57.320
on the DS, now that sounds pretty good.

09:57.320 --> 10:03.420
Superman Returns, the video game on PlayStation 2. Oh. Oh. I played the demo of Superman Returns

10:03.420 --> 10:07.080
for Xbox 360. Sucked.

10:07.080 --> 10:12.240
You know, it was more fun to pick up a stranger and try to drop them in the ocean or leave

10:12.240 --> 10:15.880
them on the beach and then fly away. Like, I had more fun with the whole sandbox element

10:15.880 --> 10:20.600
than playing the actual game. It's pretty bad. I'm not going to pick up the full game

10:20.600 --> 10:24.320
based off that demo. I know you're not supposed to make a final judgment of a game based off

10:24.320 --> 10:27.320
a demo, but seriously, don't put it on Marketplace if you don't want people to do that.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.440
I can't pull my pre-order from based off the demo.

10:30.440 --> 10:36.200
Yeah, I can't say I blame you. Oh, also, The Sims 2 Pets coming out on the PSP, also from

10:36.200 --> 10:41.480
EA. Far Cry Vengeance and Marvel Ultimate Alliance on the Wii on the 22nd. Also, Star

10:41.480 --> 10:45.480
Trek Tactical Assault on the DS, also on the 22nd.

10:45.480 --> 10:51.040
And also for the U.S. Sorry, did I cut you off? My bad. No, not yet. It's okay.

10:51.040 --> 10:54.800
Anyways, so, the U.S. We've got some pretty good releases this week. Twilight Princess

10:54.800 --> 10:58.880
on the GameCube, you know, for those who may not have a Wii yet. Definitely worth picking

10:58.880 --> 10:59.880
up. Holdouts.

10:59.880 --> 11:03.600
All your holdouts. Star Trek Legacy, which actually I think that

11:03.600 --> 11:08.840
came out last week. Some of this list is wrong. Anyways, moving on.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.040
I don't remember seeing Star Trek Legacy when I went to the store today.

11:12.040 --> 11:16.600
I thought that was last week. It's moved around so many times it's hard for me to remember.

11:16.600 --> 11:21.040
Blazing Angels on PlayStation 3. Yay.

11:21.040 --> 11:25.520
And Fullmetal Alchemist Dual Sympathy on the DS.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.960
What you hear is supposed to be better than the PlayStation 2 ones.

11:28.960 --> 11:33.800
Let's see here. Elibits on the Wii. I can't wait to pick that one up. That one looks pretty

11:33.800 --> 11:36.560
awesome. I want to get that too, yeah.

11:36.560 --> 11:43.040
Let's see here. Then, I do believe on the PC we've got Rayman's Raving Rabbids finally

11:43.040 --> 11:48.680
making its way out there. And, let's see here. Oh, there's actually a few other things on

11:48.680 --> 11:51.040
the Wii. Metal Slug Anthology.

11:51.040 --> 11:56.120
Chicken Little Ace in Action. Rainbow Six Vegas is finally making its way

11:56.120 --> 12:03.780
on the PC. And then, on the PSP we've got Blitz Overtime.

12:03.780 --> 12:08.920
Which is a part of Blitz League. And then, actually I don't think there's any

12:08.920 --> 12:15.560
love for PlayStation 2. Not too much at least. College Hoops 2K7 which was delayed from the

12:15.560 --> 12:23.080
original Xbox 360 launch. And then, yeah, that's about it.

12:23.080 --> 12:26.960
December is really horrible for games. Yeah, I mean we got most of your big shit

12:26.960 --> 12:29.320
already last month. Pretty much, yeah.

12:29.320 --> 12:34.240
Japan, also kind of slow over there. But they are getting some releases including on December

12:34.240 --> 12:38.440
14th on the Xbox 360 they're getting Phantasy Star Universe finally.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.160
We actually got it first on the 360 here in America.

12:41.160 --> 12:44.560
So, rumor is the Japanese and English servers are supposedly together.

12:44.560 --> 12:48.240
So, you might start seeing some Japanese players start populating the game if you're an Xbox

12:48.240 --> 12:52.120
360 player. Also, a game called Earth Defense Forces 3

12:52.120 --> 12:58.400
coming out on the 14th of December. They're getting Lost Planet on December 21st

12:58.400 --> 13:02.480
might I point out as well. Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Full Auto

13:02.480 --> 13:06.000
2, Battle Lines. Oh, that's actually, is that the US release

13:06.000 --> 13:10.800
actually? Could be? I believe that it came, the US one came out

13:10.800 --> 13:12.840
last week. Oh, so they're getting I guess that over

13:12.840 --> 13:17.720
in the Asian territories as well. Motorstorm, also the Japanese version of Motorstorm

13:17.720 --> 13:21.140
coming out December 14th. We have to wait until March.

13:21.140 --> 13:25.580
Coming out, well, trust me it isn't much. Coming out on the Wii, Pokemon Battle Revolution

13:25.580 --> 13:30.120
and Rayman Raving Rabbids. Also, a title based off of Bleach is coming

13:30.120 --> 13:36.960
out there as well on the Nintendo Wii. Coming out on the PlayStation 2, Beat Mania

13:36.960 --> 13:40.080
2DX Happy Sky. A lot of you music game fans have been waiting

13:40.080 --> 13:42.760
for that one. That is finally coming out this week, December

13:42.760 --> 13:45.620
14th. So, be on the lookout for that.

13:45.620 --> 13:49.320
Lots and lots of PS2 titles by the way coming out this week in Japan.

13:49.320 --> 13:56.480
Nobunaga no Yabu. Actually, I think that's just going into best hits this week.

13:56.480 --> 14:01.960
Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2 also going into the best hits.

14:01.960 --> 14:06.520
And looks like a lot of games getting price reductions on the PS2 this week in Japan.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.560
So check that out. Well, as I mentioned earlier.

14:09.560 --> 14:14.100
Wait, one more, sorry, one more. I want to say on the DS, three Rockman games

14:14.100 --> 14:17.520
coming out. Ryuusi no Rockman Dragon, Leo and Pegasus

14:17.520 --> 14:20.960
all coming out December 14th. Now, what's the funniest game title for this

14:20.960 --> 14:23.560
week? For the DS?

14:23.560 --> 14:28.800
Just for anything. I don't know, there's not a lot of funny stuff

14:28.800 --> 14:31.000
this week. Oh, here we go.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.480
Stationary style set DS Lite, although that's not a game, it's just a set.

14:35.480 --> 14:39.880
It's like a little, you know, like accessory. I don't know, that's the best I could do,

14:39.880 --> 14:41.600
sorry. Okay, anyway.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.000
No Love Hamster this week, sorry. Love Hamster.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.720
Let's see, anyways, as I mentioned earlier, the PlayStation 3 just had a firmware update

14:49.720 --> 14:57.840
and was fixing some of the issues that they had with 720p being downscaled to 480p for

14:57.840 --> 15:03.120
those people that had older TVs that couldn't do the 720p and only did 1080i.

15:03.120 --> 15:09.280
Well, apparently there's a firmware update now, the version 1.3, which actually made

15:09.280 --> 15:16.640
attempts to patching that. It makes the 1080i the default resolution

15:16.640 --> 15:23.160
now, and then the 720p as kind of secondary, so for the people that had, you know, the

15:23.160 --> 15:27.480
1080i only HDTVs, you know, kind of fixed some of that.

15:27.480 --> 15:34.240
However, though, there's still, if you want to watch a Blu-ray movie, the machine will

15:34.240 --> 15:38.880
still scale it back, I guess, to 480p, so you have to switch it manually.

15:38.880 --> 15:42.000
It sounds like that they've sort of fixed the problem, but not quite fixed it all the

15:42.000 --> 15:47.040
way yet, so a little confusing, I guess, you know, mainly having switched up.

15:47.040 --> 15:52.360
Why can't it be just simple, like the 360 where, you know, if it's in 1080i, it stays

15:52.360 --> 15:56.800
in 1080i unless they pop in a DVD, which is only going to go to 480p anyways.

15:56.800 --> 16:01.280
I mean, I don't know, why can't you just manually select your resolution?

16:01.280 --> 16:04.720
That seems like it should make sense. Stop trying to think for me.

16:04.720 --> 16:10.280
Well, I know Sony's been taking a lot of heat lately, but slowly but surely, we're starting

16:10.280 --> 16:14.880
to hear some pretty rad things coming out of Sony, and I think this is pretty awesome.

16:14.880 --> 16:19.000
Even though there is no, you know, price or date set for this, the PlayStation Network

16:19.000 --> 16:21.840
is going to be getting Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.

16:21.840 --> 16:22.840
I think that's pretty rad.

16:22.840 --> 16:23.840
That's pretty awesome.

16:23.840 --> 16:24.840
Yeah.

16:24.840 --> 16:28.020
That's according to Famitsu Weekly, and Bandai Namco is going to be releasing this for the

16:28.020 --> 16:29.440
download service.

16:29.440 --> 16:33.280
Probably Japan will get this first, but at least gives us an idea of what's to come.

16:33.280 --> 16:38.840
The PlayStation 3 version will feature full 1080p visual, and you'll also be able to play

16:38.840 --> 16:43.800
Jinpachi, who previously was unplayable because he was a boss in the arcade version.

16:43.800 --> 16:47.080
All the various modes that you saw in the arcade game, including Arcade Battle, Ghost

16:47.080 --> 16:50.680
Battle, Gallery, will also be available in the PlayStation 3 version.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.480
No word, though, if you could play it online.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.360
I mean, I think that would be a pretty cool addition, but then again, if they were to

16:55.360 --> 16:58.520
go that far with it, shit, they could probably release it as a full game and make pretty

16:58.520 --> 16:59.520
good money.

16:59.520 --> 17:03.920
So, it'll be interesting to see how much they charge for this on the PlayStation Network.

17:03.920 --> 17:08.680
Certainly could be one of the, you know, I think PlayStation's kind of been looking for

17:08.680 --> 17:17.000
its geometry wars, and sure, you've got Blast Factor and Blow, or Blow, Flow, Flow seems

17:17.000 --> 17:20.240
to look pretty cool if you've played the little web application online.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.720
I'm not going to live that one down.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.860
But this could be like the, you know, must have.

17:24.860 --> 17:28.520
This in like Gran Turismo HD also coming out in the network, you know, they're going to

17:28.520 --> 17:32.680
have some pretty powerful stuff on their network soon, so Sony, and you know, I guess they

17:32.680 --> 17:34.000
got Lemmings this week, too.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.400
Yeah, Lemmings 2, and it was a remake.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.680
It was completely redone.

17:38.680 --> 17:39.680
Lemmings 2 was fun.

17:39.680 --> 17:40.680
I liked it.

17:40.680 --> 17:45.280
So, slowly but surely is Sony making some waves in the online scene, I must say.

17:45.280 --> 17:48.000
For once, I say, good job, Sony.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.080
Yep, and actually Enchanted Arms for the PlayStation 3 is going to be getting some enhancements

17:54.080 --> 17:56.440
as well.

17:56.440 --> 17:59.520
It's kind of cool just to see that it's not just a port.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.920
What they're going to be adding, though, are going to be some graphical tweaks, of course,

18:02.920 --> 18:08.360
including new character animations, new chapters to the story, new golems will appear, and

18:08.360 --> 18:10.000
the battle system will be improved.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.200
Will the voice acting be improved?

18:12.200 --> 18:13.400
I don't know about that.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.400
Well, that's too bad.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.880
Even the themes for the opening and ending will be recomposed by Mink.

18:17.880 --> 18:20.240
That's kind of weird.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.980
I wonder why.

18:21.980 --> 18:23.840
It seemed fine in the 360 version.

18:23.840 --> 18:24.840
Okay, whatever.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.320
Whatever they want to do.

18:26.320 --> 18:31.680
I would not pay $60 for this on PlayStation 3, though, when I already have it on Xbox.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.520
It's a decent game.

18:33.520 --> 18:37.920
I think for most people, unless you're like hardcore RPG, it's probably going to be a

18:37.920 --> 18:41.520
little more of a rental for you, but I had a good time with it on 360.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.760
I really do need to finish the damn game.

18:44.760 --> 18:45.760
You know me.

18:45.760 --> 18:46.760
I have gamer ADD.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.120
I can never stick with one game too long.

18:49.120 --> 18:54.820
Well, a lot of flack coming Sony's way, even though we just said something nice about them.

18:54.820 --> 18:59.840
Of course, other folks out there like to, ourselves included, we're no less guilty,

18:59.840 --> 19:01.280
have given Sony a lot of flack.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.640
This is very interesting.

19:02.640 --> 19:06.880
Again, your favorite, Loki, the analyst groups.

19:06.880 --> 19:14.120
This analyst group called Symphonie has noticed that as far as market influence goes, HD DVD

19:14.120 --> 19:20.960
has a 46% more positive discussions when it comes to websites than Blu-ray.

19:20.960 --> 19:25.560
About half as many people are impressed with Blu-ray visuals than are with HD DVD visuals.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.480
I guess these guys are scanning websites to see what people are saying.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.760
Of course, they don't say what websites they're looking at, but whatever.

19:31.760 --> 19:35.040
Now what's interesting about this is that they say the key reasons for the low Blu-ray

19:35.040 --> 19:43.780
acceptance is the forced inclusion on the PlayStation 3 and Sony's previous format reputation.

19:43.780 --> 19:48.660
This might be alluding to the fact that PlayStation 3 might actually be being harmed by the fact

19:48.660 --> 19:51.600
that the Blu-ray is a forced thing on it.

19:51.600 --> 19:56.400
Just like the UMDs, UMDs didn't really take off either.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.400
We all know why UMDs didn't work, because they were charging more than they were for

19:59.400 --> 20:03.120
the DVDs and there wasn't as much on them, and that you couldn't watch them on a TV.

20:03.120 --> 20:07.320
It was a stupid format from the beginning, really.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.800
If they had charged half as much as the DVDs, I bet the format would have done a whole lot

20:10.800 --> 20:11.800
better.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.800
A whole lot better.

20:13.800 --> 20:20.440
I just want to say, by the way, what a report like this could do is it could make more of

20:20.440 --> 20:25.600
those movie studios want to put out HD DVDs, which in the end is going to really hurt Sony.

20:25.600 --> 20:30.360
It is going to hurt them, because pretty soon it's not going to be...

20:30.360 --> 20:34.080
And that's the thing with Blu-ray and HD DVD.

20:34.080 --> 20:40.160
I don't think anyone is really jumping into it right now either, because I buy a movie

20:40.160 --> 20:41.400
that's in...

20:41.400 --> 20:43.080
I buy an HD DVD player.

20:43.080 --> 20:47.440
Well, now some of my movies are going to be on this format and some of them aren't.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.440
So what?

20:48.440 --> 20:49.440
I have to buy two different players?

20:49.440 --> 20:50.440
Fuck that shit.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.280
I ain't going to buy that stuff.

20:52.280 --> 20:56.840
Everyone's waiting until one format prevails and that's what they're going to buy.

20:56.840 --> 21:00.760
Black Wolf, our good buddy Bobby Black Wolf is in chat right now, and he's bringing up

21:00.760 --> 21:02.560
an interesting point.

21:02.560 --> 21:09.120
He says HD DVD has a reference DVD that really shows off the power of the format, King Kong.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.840
Blu-ray doesn't really have a comparable reference DVD.

21:11.840 --> 21:16.720
He says Talladega Nights, which you might be thinking, not really a good choice, because

21:16.720 --> 21:21.400
King Kong was more of an action type movie and big special effects.

21:21.400 --> 21:26.360
Talladega Nights, maybe a few racing scenes here and there, but otherwise not exactly

21:26.360 --> 21:32.560
a big explosions and manly man movie to show off the effects.

21:32.560 --> 21:37.320
What they need to do is they need to fucking bring out the special edition of Final Fantasy

21:37.320 --> 21:39.120
Advent Children.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.800
That shit would blow people away.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.160
Might not be a bad title for Blu-ray.

21:43.160 --> 21:47.320
That's the only thing I want Blu-ray for is that movie, but GS68 says they should use

21:47.320 --> 21:48.320
snakes on a plane.

21:48.320 --> 21:53.360
I don't think the snakes on a plane should be used for a reference for anything other

21:53.360 --> 21:55.680
than crappy movie.

21:55.680 --> 22:02.840
Anyways, so the PlayStation 3, Sony is of course talking about improvements that they're

22:02.840 --> 22:05.600
possibly going to make to the system as well.

22:05.600 --> 22:10.520
They're talking about introducing new third party applications and hardware, new controller

22:10.520 --> 22:14.720
schemes like the Eye of Judgment that's going to suck and-

22:14.720 --> 22:17.760
Shit, we haven't heard about that in a long time, have we?

22:17.760 --> 22:19.840
Maybe they went back and made it better.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.120
That was supposed to be a launch title.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.400
What ever fucking happened to that?

22:22.400 --> 22:27.280
Oh, I know, because it sucks as a game console peripheral, because you have to have this

22:27.280 --> 22:29.560
giant elaborate set up to play a card game.

22:29.560 --> 22:30.560
No, I don't think so.

22:30.560 --> 22:32.880
That's not what I'm going to spend my $600 on.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.720
But it's the Eye of Judgment.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.560
At least that's how they were always introducing it.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.320
The Eye of Judgment.

22:39.320 --> 22:44.760
Yeah, they could have gotten away with the brown Eye of Judgment and take a dump on your

22:44.760 --> 22:45.760
console.

22:45.760 --> 22:51.400
Anyways, so it's kind of interesting though about the whole article and this one text

22:51.400 --> 22:57.960
site Smart House saying that Sony will launch a PlayStation 4 but not any sooner than 2010.

22:57.960 --> 23:02.360
Wait a second, I thought the PlayStation 3 is future proof and it's going to have a ten

23:02.360 --> 23:03.360
year cycle.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.360
Oopsies.

23:04.360 --> 23:13.760
Anyways, so, duh, they're going to be adding more content and more stuff like iTunes and

23:13.760 --> 23:15.960
blah, blah, blah.

23:15.960 --> 23:19.600
It's going to basically be the same thing as all the other consoles out there.

23:19.600 --> 23:26.600
They're going to offer download services for video and for music and for games.

23:26.600 --> 23:30.920
It's not a big surprise.

23:30.920 --> 23:35.160
Unless they said, you know, the PlayStation 4 is going to print money.

23:35.160 --> 23:43.160
I'm surprised that Circuit City ad did not say that the DS prints money or something

23:43.160 --> 23:44.160
like that.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.920
I keep thinking of that picture I've seen all throughout the internet where it says

23:46.920 --> 23:47.920
it prints money.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.960
It has the happy Iwata and Miyamoto.

23:50.960 --> 23:56.400
Anyway, I'm thinking about PlayStation 4 and I kind of think about it in my mind.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.280
I know it's way too early to think about it.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.400
What could really be better?

23:59.400 --> 24:03.600
I mean, graphically these games are starting to look so realistic.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.920
It's hard to imagine what could be even better, but I guess you never know.

24:06.920 --> 24:09.080
I mean, I guess I won't know it until I see it.

24:09.080 --> 24:13.280
And you know, a lot of us probably thought the same thing when the NES first came out.

24:13.280 --> 24:16.960
Like, oh man, this is so much better than Atari 2600.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.520
Games will never look better than this.

24:18.520 --> 24:22.760
Listen, okay, the PlayStation 4 is going to be able to put out games at fucking 240 frames

24:22.760 --> 24:29.400
per second and it's going to be in full 2160p.

24:29.400 --> 24:33.480
Yes, but will it have the Eye of Judgment?

24:33.480 --> 24:34.800
Of course it will.

24:34.800 --> 24:38.920
And you know what the Eye of Judgment is going to be used for now?

24:38.920 --> 24:40.080
Plane checkers.

24:40.080 --> 24:44.440
Because checkers have never been so extreme.

24:44.440 --> 24:51.160
Seriously, do you, I mean, I don't know about you, but like, if you were to play Magic Cards,

24:51.160 --> 24:56.200
do you actually imagine, like, throwing a fireball at somebody or are your monsters

24:56.200 --> 24:57.200
actually attacking?

24:57.200 --> 25:00.160
Or is it just more of a strategy game that you're playing as characters?

25:00.160 --> 25:05.280
I mean, do you really need the visual representation of your monster attacking some other monster?

25:05.280 --> 25:10.520
And is that really worth the, you know, $600 for the console and there's a giant elaborate

25:10.520 --> 25:14.200
setup that looks like it would never work as a peripheral?

25:14.200 --> 25:20.280
I mean, and can you really imagine yourself, I bought this system and I bought these special

25:20.280 --> 25:25.600
cards which, by the way, can probably be photocopied and used in the game, you know, instead of

25:25.600 --> 25:29.760
buying these special decks because there's no copy protection against these cards.

25:29.760 --> 25:33.560
I want to see them release this thing because it's the dumbest idea on the face here.

25:33.560 --> 25:37.520
I remember when we went and saw this thing being demonstrated at E3, I walked out of

25:37.520 --> 25:39.760
there and go, what the fuck was that?

25:39.760 --> 25:42.160
I mean, this is not going to work as a game.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.420
Which is funny because Miyamoto was going in right after us and I think you probably

25:45.420 --> 25:48.060
heard that.

25:48.060 --> 25:52.480
It was the dumbest thing, they were like, I wanted to raise my hand and go, why would

25:52.480 --> 25:53.480
you buy this?

25:53.480 --> 25:55.600
I mean, really, this is stupid.

25:55.600 --> 26:00.200
And with the tech demo right now, great, leave it as a tech demo, then you see it as a launch

26:00.200 --> 26:01.200
game.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.440
No, it's stupid.

26:03.440 --> 26:08.560
Just stop wasting the time on this and produce some better games.

26:08.560 --> 26:12.720
I like the brown eye of judgment, that's something they should do.

26:12.720 --> 26:19.840
I'm seriously, I mean, the brown eye of judgment would be more of a beneficial peripheral than

26:19.840 --> 26:28.680
the fucking, you know, at least it would be neat, you know, I mean, like, look, the PlayStation

26:28.680 --> 26:34.160
3 just took a dump, I mean, that's a lot cooler than saying, look, I made a card game, I mean,

26:34.160 --> 26:35.160
come on.

26:35.160 --> 26:41.120
I mean, they have the little dollies that will fucking take a dump when you feed them,

26:41.120 --> 26:45.840
I mean, if your console can do the same thing, that'd be kind of neat, I guess.

26:45.840 --> 26:54.280
I don't know, I can't just imagine with the brown eye of judgment when you're doing so

26:54.280 --> 26:59.920
horribly in a game, the console shits itself.

26:59.920 --> 27:03.880
Wait, you know, they have rumble on your-

27:03.880 --> 27:10.740
My Sony, my Sony, wherever I go, he goes.

27:10.740 --> 27:13.800
It's like this, okay, you know how they have the rumble features, you know, when there's

27:13.800 --> 27:19.400
something scary on the screen, it'll shake, well, now your console can actually shit itself

27:19.400 --> 27:21.680
when something scary is on the screen.

27:21.680 --> 27:27.840
I mean, this is how ridiculous this peripheral is, I mean, I really wish our listeners could

27:27.840 --> 27:32.060
have been there at E3 when they're demonstrating this thing, because it was the most ridiculous

27:32.060 --> 27:33.060
peripheral.

27:33.060 --> 27:34.060
It was like-

27:34.060 --> 27:37.000
Isn't somebody in the room like it was you or somebody asked, like, what the hell's the

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
point of this thing?

27:38.000 --> 27:41.520
Like, I swear to God, someone asked the question, like, what are you going to do with this?

27:41.520 --> 27:42.520
I mean-

27:42.520 --> 27:43.520
Like, is this it?

27:43.520 --> 27:47.680
Like, I swear you asked, like, is this it?

27:47.680 --> 27:49.000
Could I just copy the guards?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.160
I mean, seriously, what is it?

27:51.160 --> 27:53.600
And they raced us out of there.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.480
It was so horrible.

27:55.480 --> 27:56.800
Sorry.

27:56.800 --> 28:04.880
I like this, Jeremy Todd one says, the brown eye of judgment, this thing is the shit.

28:04.880 --> 28:19.120
You know what else never gets old is stories about stupid children and stupid parents.

28:19.120 --> 28:25.960
A South Carolina woman recently called the cops on her 12-year-old son and had him arrested,

28:25.960 --> 28:32.120
charged with petty larceny for stealing a Christmas present from under the tree.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.360
What does this have to do with games?

28:33.360 --> 28:35.640
Well, it was a Game Boy Advance.

28:35.640 --> 28:41.960
Now, supposedly, this actually follows a string of crimes committed by the kid, shoplifting,

28:41.960 --> 28:44.960
stealing from mom's wallet, and, oh, punching a cop.

28:44.960 --> 28:52.280
Well, I'm glad that they got him in before it was too late, you know?

28:52.280 --> 28:53.720
Next thing you know, he's going to murder someone-

28:53.720 --> 28:55.200
Stealing from Santa Claus.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.160
No, no, no, that's a big no-no.

28:57.160 --> 29:00.120
You know what they should do when they take him into court, they should say, so you're

29:00.120 --> 29:01.440
into games, huh?

29:01.440 --> 29:07.840
Well, instead of having a normal judge, we're going to bring in the brown eye of judgment

29:07.840 --> 29:11.560
and then it will decide if it's going to shit on the kid or not.

29:11.560 --> 29:12.560
That'd be great.

29:12.560 --> 29:13.560
You know what?

29:13.560 --> 29:14.560
No, it's kind of interesting.

29:14.560 --> 29:19.720
I'm surprised they haven't sued Nintendo over the Game Boy Advance because the desire for

29:19.720 --> 29:24.800
the console made him punch a cop because I'm sure that's what they're going to, you know-

29:24.800 --> 29:27.940
You know, there's a story that didn't get on our show roll tonight that I want to say

29:27.940 --> 29:31.720
Rob Way sent to our mailbox, and sorry about that, buddy, we just, um, I forgot to put

29:31.720 --> 29:33.760
it on there, but I'll mention it now.

29:33.760 --> 29:37.440
Something about, speaking of cops, that cops were using their badges to cut to the front

29:37.440 --> 29:38.440
of the PlayStation 3 line.

29:38.440 --> 29:39.440
Did you hear about that?

29:39.440 --> 29:40.440
Yeah.

29:40.440 --> 29:41.440
They were, like, using their authority-

29:41.440 --> 29:42.440
I'm not surprised.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.440
Respect my authority!

29:43.440 --> 29:44.440
And then give me a PlayStation 3.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.080
Yeah, they did that with the 360, too.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.280
A security guard did the same thing with the 360.

29:48.280 --> 29:49.280
It's kind of messed up.

29:49.280 --> 29:50.280
Yeah.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.280
Gotta have it.

29:51.280 --> 29:52.280
Anyways.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.400
That's why the kid punched the cop.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.400
Definitely.

29:55.400 --> 29:58.360
BIPORG99 in our chat says, who buys Game Boy Advance anymore?

29:58.360 --> 30:00.360
Get a DS instead.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.360
True.

30:01.360 --> 30:02.360
No one buys Game Boy Advance.

30:02.360 --> 30:05.240
I haven't sold one in ages.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.240
Anywho.

30:06.240 --> 30:12.760
So, now there's a brand new campaign that's being launched by GameStop, among other people,

30:12.760 --> 30:17.920
to kind of educate parents on the ESRB rating system.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.160
Don't copy that floppy!

30:19.160 --> 30:22.040
Oh, sorry, the ratings.

30:22.040 --> 30:24.320
Rating systems, not copying games.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.320
Anyways.

30:25.320 --> 30:32.360
So, they've launched a brand new website called respecttheradings.com, and it's basically

30:32.360 --> 30:39.520
talking about what the ratings mean, and how you can enforce them better with your kids.

30:39.520 --> 30:43.480
Basically talking about the different genres of games and stuff.

30:43.480 --> 30:50.040
Also having a bit of- they have some actual terminology on here, which is great, because

30:50.040 --> 30:57.480
they actually define frag, defeating an opponent in a first or third person shooter game.

30:57.480 --> 31:04.520
Like giblets, tiny pieces of what's left of the character when they meet an unfortunate

31:04.520 --> 31:05.520
end.

31:05.520 --> 31:12.280
Giblets sounds like something your brown eye of judgement leaves on the camera.

31:12.280 --> 31:15.000
Just talking about different things.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
It's interesting.

31:16.000 --> 31:25.120
I guess a good tool for parents, to be honest, no matter how many websites like this, and

31:25.120 --> 31:30.600
how many posters, and how many people across the counter tell you about the rating system.

31:30.600 --> 31:34.680
You're still going to have a mom calling her cops on the kid because she can't keep a Christmas

31:34.680 --> 31:35.680
present under wraps.

31:35.680 --> 31:40.360
And you're still going to have fucking people suing game companies because their kid committed

31:40.360 --> 31:44.080
a crime and they found little Billy had a mature rating game.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.920
I had no idea what the M meant.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.840
I thought it meant it was good.

31:49.840 --> 31:55.600
M for mom with the tattoo.

31:55.600 --> 31:56.600
This is interesting.

31:56.600 --> 31:57.600
Going back to the last story a little bit.

31:57.600 --> 32:01.760
Rama in our chat room says, Jimmy Kimmel had him and his mom on the show last week and

32:01.760 --> 32:07.680
gave the kid the entire OZ DVD collection as a reminder of what happens in jail.

32:07.680 --> 32:11.480
Do not parade this child on your talk show.

32:11.480 --> 32:12.880
He's supposed to be punished.

32:12.880 --> 32:16.240
Dude, he punched a cop.

32:16.240 --> 32:18.160
I don't care if the cop punched him first.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.200
You don't do that.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.240
It's not like he just stole the damn thing from under the tree.

32:22.240 --> 32:28.760
I mean, they're having him and his mom on television going like, oh, ha ha ha, it's just

32:28.760 --> 32:33.080
a big misunderstanding, wah wah wah wah, we're one big happy dysfunctional family.

32:33.080 --> 32:37.120
He's probably like on there, man, if I knew it was going to be this famous, I would have

32:37.120 --> 32:38.880
stabbed the bitch in the vagina.

32:38.880 --> 32:39.880
Exactly.

32:39.880 --> 32:43.680
I'm just encouraging him to do it again and worse, because what's going to happen when

32:43.680 --> 32:46.080
this kid's 15 minutes of fame runs out this time?

32:46.080 --> 32:48.600
In fact, I'm done talking about him.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.440
I don't want to talk about this kid anymore.

32:50.440 --> 32:55.360
I'm glad I didn't say his name.

32:55.360 --> 32:59.200
So yeah, respect the ratings, bitch.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.520
That's what GameStop says.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.840
And Activision also is hoping folks respect the ratings.

33:03.840 --> 33:07.240
They're actually surveying parents on the ESRB.

33:07.240 --> 33:12.560
They found that an overwhelming 84% of parents were familiar with the ESRB rating system.

33:12.560 --> 33:18.280
79% of them say they pay close attention to the ratings of games their children play.

33:18.280 --> 33:19.280
Very interesting.

33:19.280 --> 33:25.340
Now, you know, also 80.4% of all statistics are made up on the spot, I suppose, but they

33:25.340 --> 33:31.400
do say that in this survey, 1,014 online interviews were conducted among a nationally representative

33:31.400 --> 33:36.480
group of video game players aged 88 to 24 and their parents.

33:36.480 --> 33:39.680
They did this over a week from a Harrison group, who I've heard of before.

33:39.680 --> 33:44.040
They're a pretty respectable surveying group.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.040
So interesting.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.040
Well, great.

33:46.040 --> 33:48.760
Well, there were some interesting guides.

33:48.760 --> 33:54.240
I know one of them was posted on Engadget this week talking about what you need, because

33:54.240 --> 33:59.540
definitely one of the big gifts this holiday season is HGTVs, especially with game systems

33:59.540 --> 34:06.080
out there, a lot of them requiring high def for better graphics and stuff.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.040
You're going to need an HGTV at some point.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.480
It's time to go with the times.

34:09.480 --> 34:16.600
So there's a wonderful little guide, and actually this was done by A&E Interactive, part of

34:16.600 --> 34:24.820
Mercury News, and they've got a guide to what gamers need to know when buying an HGTV.

34:24.820 --> 34:30.040
And they go through everything from the basics, including what the different things mean,

34:30.040 --> 34:37.520
including 480p, what the progressive versus interlaced means.

34:37.520 --> 34:43.940
Very interesting stuff, including comparisons between flat panel or rear projection, etc.

34:43.940 --> 34:48.120
And personally, the other thing, I don't know if it was mentioned on here, but another thing

34:48.120 --> 34:52.880
you might want to check also when looking into a TV is websites like IGN, for example,

34:52.880 --> 34:58.980
were running lists of HGTVs and possible lag on these TVs.

34:58.980 --> 35:01.660
So you want to check into lag, definitely.

35:01.660 --> 35:08.960
Also price-wise, you want to make sure that your TV is going to be putting out the right

35:08.960 --> 35:13.600
resolution for you, whether you want to sell at 720p or you want to spend the money and

35:13.600 --> 35:14.600
get 1080p.

35:14.600 --> 35:20.080
And really, unless you have a really large TV, you're not going to really notice the

35:20.080 --> 35:23.560
difference between 1080p and probably 1080i.

35:23.560 --> 35:29.160
You know what they're really considering though, is it cheap?

35:29.160 --> 35:32.700
Because most of these guys are what, like college kids that are trying to pool together

35:32.700 --> 35:37.820
the money they've got to buy a good TV, so they're just going to buy something cheap.

35:37.820 --> 35:44.960
If I were our listeners, what I would do is, and this is how I bought my TV, shopping around

35:44.960 --> 35:50.400
I actually found Newegg.com was pretty cheap, they had a lot of refurbished TVs.

35:50.400 --> 35:56.720
And you can buy refurbished TV, maybe it's last year's model or earlier this year, whatever,

35:56.720 --> 35:58.760
but it's still pretty good for the price.

35:58.760 --> 36:07.600
And I got a 37-inch TV, does upwards to 1080i, actually has built-in VGA, DVI, et cetera,

36:07.600 --> 36:08.920
for about $800.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.440
And it wasn't that bad.

36:10.440 --> 36:11.860
And they're only going to come down in price.

36:11.860 --> 36:15.860
And probably if you shop right after Christmas, I think you're going to get a lot of deals

36:15.860 --> 36:17.120
that way too.

36:17.120 --> 36:18.120
Here's how I got mine.

36:18.120 --> 36:22.920
About a year ago, I bought an HDTV at Costco for about $600.

36:22.920 --> 36:26.800
And that was a 30-inch widescreen, now it was a CRT, so I had a big back and some things

36:26.800 --> 36:28.460
were a little bit blurry on it.

36:28.460 --> 36:32.800
But here's the thing, that thing broke after like a year, but since I bought it from Costco,

36:32.800 --> 36:34.000
they'll take it back.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.760
So I took it because I still had the receipt, I held onto that baby.

36:36.760 --> 36:41.280
So I took it back to the Costco, they took it back, and for about $100 more, I got an

36:41.280 --> 36:45.720
upgrade to a flat 32-inch widescreen TV that's pretty awesome.

36:45.720 --> 36:49.360
Costco's an in-house brand, but you know what, it works great for what I need.

36:49.360 --> 36:55.200
And the one I bought, it's I don't think really a name brand, but it's just fine.

36:55.200 --> 37:01.320
Really when you're buying a lot of these TVs, they're Sony or Toshiba or whatever, you're

37:01.320 --> 37:07.120
buying it based off a brand, and brand names sometimes run a lot more expensive than they

37:07.120 --> 37:08.120
really need to.

37:08.120 --> 37:17.080
So just read the reviews online, compare pricing, compare features, definitely read any feedback

37:17.080 --> 37:21.840
people have left about certain TVs and stuff, what issues you may run into.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.800
Like mine, going into it, I knew it had a crappy TV remote, and when I bought it, yeah,

37:25.800 --> 37:30.800
it has a really crappy TV remote that sucks balls, but that's the only thing that's really

37:30.800 --> 37:35.720
bad about it, and that can be fixed if I really want to with a universal remote.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.240
And I'm just too lazy and I don't care, so it'll work just fine.

37:39.240 --> 37:40.760
But that's about it.

37:40.760 --> 37:46.440
So just really do your research and score a pretty good HDTV.

37:46.440 --> 37:51.200
Or if you're really cheap, just fucking buy the VGA cables for whatever system you want

37:51.200 --> 37:54.760
to play it on, and just play it on your TV or your computer monitor.

37:54.760 --> 38:01.200
That's what I did with my 360 before I had an HDTV, and it works just good, so interesting.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.640
All right, well we're going to get into the mailbag, but first we're going to go to our

38:03.640 --> 38:08.120
voicemail of the week, and if you want to leave us a voicemail, you can always give

38:08.120 --> 38:12.440
us a call after show hours to 1-877-GAME-OLR.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.940
That's a toll-free number in the US and Canada.

38:14.940 --> 38:19.360
Get this, here is our voicemail of the week that somebody left.

38:19.360 --> 38:23.480
I love you guys!

38:23.480 --> 38:24.480
That's it.

38:24.480 --> 38:29.480
Well, we love you too, but next time leave your name.

38:29.480 --> 38:32.840
Needless to say, we have not been getting many voicemails of the week, so we are encouraging

38:32.840 --> 38:39.320
you guys to leave your thoughts on the program in audio format by giving us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

38:39.320 --> 38:42.400
Thanks to the anonymous listener who was spreading the love there, though, we appreciate it.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.840
It inflates our egos.

38:43.840 --> 38:44.920
We like that.

38:44.920 --> 38:48.880
Let's get into our mailbag, boys and girls, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

38:48.880 --> 38:59.080
Of course, Dark Sakura is not here this week, which means I'm going to be reading the mail,

38:59.080 --> 39:00.680
so deal.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.200
Next email comes to us from ureelover tonight.

39:03.200 --> 39:06.280
Dear OLR, you guys suck!

39:06.280 --> 39:07.280
And sarcasm.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.360
He was just teasing because we said we didn't get enough hate mail.

39:09.360 --> 39:12.840
Anyway, I remember listening to one of the podcasts a few weeks ago, and I forgot to

39:12.840 --> 39:13.960
email you guys about it.

39:13.960 --> 39:17.040
It was during the Wii launch, and some people were playing Risk at the front of the waiting

39:17.040 --> 39:19.240
line, just like the old gamers back in the day do.

39:19.240 --> 39:23.960
And I was just wondering, what bored tabletop games would you like to see in the Xbox 360

39:23.960 --> 39:27.160
Marketplace Wii Connect PlayStation 3 online service?

39:27.160 --> 39:30.320
I personally would like to see a couple things, first being Risk.

39:30.320 --> 39:34.160
I would love to be able to say to the other people, I have Australia, bitches!

39:34.160 --> 39:36.720
Or eat that, com shtaka!

39:36.720 --> 39:39.920
Another one would be Monopoly, just seeing people's faces when they land on Park Place

39:39.920 --> 39:42.240
with a hotel, and if they'd have to pay up.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.720
The last one would be Candyland.

39:44.720 --> 39:48.400
Don't know why, but I bet it would be Microsoft's new Gears of War or Halo 3.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.400
Definitely.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.560
Keep up the good work, and reject false icons.

39:51.560 --> 39:53.100
Thank you, ureelover.

39:53.100 --> 39:56.680
So what bored games would you like to see on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox Live?

39:56.680 --> 39:57.680
What do you think?

39:57.680 --> 40:01.360
I'd like to see a second Monopoly, that might be fun, especially with the Xbox Live Vision

40:01.360 --> 40:02.360
camera.

40:02.360 --> 40:05.800
Because then you can dress up like Mr. Moneybags.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.720
And I'm trying to think, actually...

40:07.720 --> 40:11.240
Well you know you're getting Settlers of Catan in some of the British games, which

40:11.240 --> 40:12.240
is kind of cool.

40:12.240 --> 40:14.600
They're also doing Checkers and Chess, I think, at some point too.

40:14.600 --> 40:18.360
I remember that was with the Vision camera.

40:18.360 --> 40:21.440
Battleship might be pretty fun.

40:21.440 --> 40:25.120
You know, actually, it'd be kind of cool to see some other, like...

40:25.120 --> 40:28.320
I have one, I have one, Clue.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.320
Clue would be fun.

40:29.320 --> 40:30.320
Clue would be awesome.

40:30.320 --> 40:34.840
And I don't want regular Clue, I want Clue Master Detective.

40:34.840 --> 40:38.000
Or how about if you could, like, patch your, like, they could, see, you know what Xbox

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
could do?

40:39.000 --> 40:43.400
Is that they could charge you then, like, you know, 80 points to download, you know,

40:43.400 --> 40:47.040
The Simpsons Clue, and, you know, what other Clue games they've done.

40:47.040 --> 40:51.180
All the licensed versions of Clue that they have, and, you know, Cameo Clue, and Project

40:51.180 --> 40:53.520
Gotham Racing Clue.

40:53.520 --> 40:56.080
I think it was the Ford.

40:56.080 --> 41:00.360
It was the Ford in the Indy Raceway with the carbon monoxide.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.520
Okay, maybe that's kind of lame, I don't know.

41:03.520 --> 41:06.320
Next email comes to us from DDR Dollar Bill.

41:06.320 --> 41:11.000
Hi, my name is Bill, though some of the DDR players from New York City and New Jersey

41:11.000 --> 41:12.840
know me as Dollar Bill.

41:12.840 --> 41:17.300
I used to freestyle on DDR a lot since 2001 and still do, though not as much anymore.

41:17.300 --> 41:20.880
I did compete this year at Digital Life, though it was all improv and not meant to be taken

41:20.880 --> 41:21.880
seriously.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.680
I was the best, but I certainly was not the worst either.

41:23.680 --> 41:28.640
The times I've had were wonderful, and I made some great stories of going to various tournaments.

41:28.640 --> 41:31.920
There's a few videos of me floating around, some good, some not so good.

41:31.920 --> 41:34.960
Seems that if it was good, it was good, and if it was bad, it was, well, let's not go

41:34.960 --> 41:35.960
there.

41:35.960 --> 41:40.880
Before I get into it, I do wonder if I'm one of the older listeners out there at age 31.

41:40.880 --> 41:45.120
I know for a fact we do have some listeners above the age of 31, and in fact, you know,

41:45.120 --> 41:51.440
our own Dark Sakura is 30, and I'm 28, so not too far away, and Loki, you're what, 26?

41:51.440 --> 41:56.480
We're not that far away.

41:56.480 --> 42:00.280
Bill goes on to say, I just wanted to say that the entire cast does a great job in every

42:00.280 --> 42:01.280
broadcast.

42:01.280 --> 42:04.280
I started listening to the podcast mainly once after I got a working iPod after going

42:04.280 --> 42:07.440
through about four of them and a creative Zen that went emo and killed itself after

42:07.440 --> 42:10.240
playing the theme song for Evangelion.

42:10.240 --> 42:14.320
I always look forward to each podcast, though I do enjoy your live show more.

42:14.320 --> 42:17.960
There's times I can't make Sunday nights due to other things going on.

42:17.960 --> 42:21.560
What I do enjoy about each show is the fresh insight into gaming, not the standard garbage

42:21.560 --> 42:25.720
that some game magazine's websites tend to publish, but rather one from every man's,

42:25.720 --> 42:29.120
and woman, I haven't forgot about you, Jamie, especially since you're also a Whovian, point

42:29.120 --> 42:30.120
of view.

42:30.120 --> 42:33.200
I recently have classified myself more as a casual gamer of late, not having the time

42:33.200 --> 42:37.680
to play every game out there, nor the finances to purchase every hot new game release, so

42:37.680 --> 42:41.140
I need to be more selective in what I picked up, and I've tended to agree with pretty much

42:41.140 --> 42:44.760
of most of what has been recommended, Elite Beat Agents, Luminous for the Mobile, or two

42:44.760 --> 42:49.840
examples I can think of right away, plunking $40 to $60 per game only to come up disappointed,

42:49.840 --> 42:54.560
and being only able to get the most half of my money back is not a good way to keep a

42:54.560 --> 42:55.560
living.

42:55.560 --> 42:58.520
I best end this letter before the chat room explodes with people saying to shut the fuck

42:58.520 --> 42:59.520
up and so forth.

42:59.520 --> 43:01.280
In conclusion, great show, guys.

43:01.280 --> 43:03.920
Keep up the work, and see you on the chat rooms whenever I can.

43:03.920 --> 43:05.520
That was a very nice email.

43:05.520 --> 43:06.520
Thank you.

43:06.520 --> 43:07.520
I thought there was a question in it.

43:07.520 --> 43:10.460
Well, I thought there was a question here somewhere, but I guess the older listeners'

43:10.460 --> 43:12.600
part was the question, but that's all right.

43:12.600 --> 43:17.080
We appreciate a nice fuzzy email once in a while that makes us feel good about what we

43:17.080 --> 43:18.840
do and not getting paid for it.

43:18.840 --> 43:19.840
We appreciate it.

43:19.840 --> 43:20.840
You guys are awesome.

43:20.840 --> 43:22.640
Yeah, I'm going to be honest.

43:22.640 --> 43:26.200
A lot of gaming mags and online publications, we've seen it firsthand.

43:26.200 --> 43:30.580
We've heard them talking at the various press events, and what they do is they rehash the

43:30.580 --> 43:34.760
press releases that they're given and turn it into an exclusive, so that's what your

43:34.760 --> 43:40.800
money's going for usually when you're paying for those subscriptions and things.

43:40.800 --> 43:44.440
We on the other hand actually like to play the games before we say anything about it,

43:44.440 --> 43:47.080
or we try to as much as we can.

43:47.080 --> 43:49.400
Next email comes to us from Ricky.

43:49.400 --> 43:53.520
As we upgrade our gaming hardware, we must at some point upgrade our televisions.

43:53.520 --> 43:57.400
To achieve the best display of your next gen system, you must have a really expensive TV.

43:57.400 --> 43:58.680
This kind of goes into your last story.

43:58.680 --> 44:01.900
This is what your average consumer will be slapped in the face with once they purchase

44:01.900 --> 44:05.840
a system and realize that there is only a marginal difference from old gen to new gen.

44:05.840 --> 44:09.960
The only people I know that can discern the differences and meanings of the whole 720i,

44:09.960 --> 44:13.920
1080p thing are the people that talk with the best buyer rep as they are persuaded to

44:13.920 --> 44:16.160
buy a wallet melting television.

44:16.160 --> 44:19.960
In the future, do you think that there will be a particular method of getting the word

44:19.960 --> 44:24.520
out about HD resolutions in the mainstream media, making the info about HD available

44:24.520 --> 44:26.200
to everyone so they can upgrade too?

44:26.200 --> 44:27.560
Your thoughts?

44:27.560 --> 44:32.800
I'm sure they're going to have, well they already have kind of, not really public service

44:32.800 --> 44:35.400
stuff, but they have info.

44:35.400 --> 44:38.880
I think unfortunately what you see now is what you're going to get.

44:38.880 --> 44:43.520
I think since it is best buying those types of places selling the TVs, it is going to

44:43.520 --> 44:48.400
be those folks selling them, obviously trying to sell the most expensive ones and the replacement

44:48.400 --> 44:53.480
plans or whatever, that are going to unfortunately be all there is for most people.

44:53.480 --> 44:57.920
I don't exactly see them running commercials on TV.

44:57.920 --> 45:04.160
Maybe in 2007, as I think especially next Christmas, HD TVs are going to be a big, big

45:04.160 --> 45:05.160
deal.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.960
I mean they already are a little bit this Christmas, but next Christmas especially,

45:06.960 --> 45:10.800
I think they're going to be even more affordable, but I don't think you're going to see a lot

45:10.800 --> 45:15.040
of, the brochures and things you're going to see are going to be a best buy.

45:15.040 --> 45:16.960
Circuit City, the place is selling the TVs.

45:16.960 --> 45:21.240
I don't exactly see there being a big public knowledge campaign.

45:21.240 --> 45:25.360
In the end, people are going to look at what's up on the wall and what's showing on the screen

45:25.360 --> 45:28.000
and they're going to go, which one's pretty?

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
So if a gamer, it's tough for a gamer because they don't show a lot of video games on those

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
things.

45:33.000 --> 45:38.400
So it's hard to choose when you're a gamer what type of TV will look best for your games.

45:38.400 --> 45:42.220
You kind of have to base it off whatever in-store feed they have running.

45:42.220 --> 45:45.640
So it makes the choice a little more difficult.

45:45.640 --> 45:46.640
We'll see though.

45:46.640 --> 45:47.640
We could be proven wrong.

45:47.640 --> 45:48.640
Who knows?

45:48.640 --> 45:49.640
Who knows what they'll do.

45:49.640 --> 45:50.640
All right.

45:50.640 --> 45:52.680
Let's go to the next email, which comes to us from Nim.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.520
Hey guys, how's it going?

45:54.520 --> 45:57.320
I haven't been able to listen to your show for a couple of weeks, seeing as I finally

45:57.320 --> 45:59.920
got my hands on BeatMania 2DX and a new girlfriend.

45:59.920 --> 46:02.000
Hey, keep your hands off her.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.160
You may not appreciate that.

46:03.160 --> 46:04.400
No, I'm kidding.

46:04.400 --> 46:05.400
If you ask, it's okay.

46:05.400 --> 46:06.960
But that's besides the point.

46:06.960 --> 46:10.780
Okay, I feel like touching on a few subjects at hand since I listened to your last podcast.

46:10.780 --> 46:14.520
First of all, I'm not sure I quote unquote hate Sony, but I don't think I'm going to

46:14.520 --> 46:18.680
even get a PS3 until they start releasing some better games or some I've heard rumors

46:18.680 --> 46:23.220
about such as Final Fantasy 7 or they start releasing BeatMania 2DX on it.

46:23.220 --> 46:26.680
The war with me is probably going to be with Microsoft and Nintendo here.

46:26.680 --> 46:30.720
The games already released for the 360 look great and I want them badly.

46:30.720 --> 46:34.120
Kind of along the same lines with the Wii, but I'm going to be waiting to get that

46:34.120 --> 46:36.960
because I've been dying to play Brawl since I've heard about it.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.600
What are some of the rumors you've heard about it?

46:38.600 --> 46:41.600
I've heard there were supposedly over 100 characters supposed to be in it.

46:41.600 --> 46:43.280
I highly doubt that, sorry.

46:43.280 --> 46:47.080
Thanks guys, I'll be tuning in hopefully tonight or I'll get your podcast tomorrow.

46:47.080 --> 46:50.200
That comes from Nim.

46:50.200 --> 46:51.200
You know what's interesting though?

46:51.200 --> 46:55.280
You say that the real war is between Microsoft and Nintendo, but I actually disagree because

46:55.280 --> 47:00.200
if Microsoft and Nintendo can pull enough of the share away from Sony, then they could

47:00.200 --> 47:02.720
both effectively claim victory in here.

47:02.720 --> 47:06.120
Let's face it, they were not number one the last time around, so either one of them comes

47:06.120 --> 47:11.880
up on top or even goes from number two to number, let's say Nintendo goes from number

47:11.880 --> 47:16.440
three to number two, they're going to be sitting pretty.

47:16.440 --> 47:20.440
Some speculate Nintendo is going to go from number three all the way to number one this

47:20.440 --> 47:21.440
time.

47:21.440 --> 47:22.440
Again, speculation.

47:22.440 --> 47:28.000
I'm an analyst, and Xbox 360 is going to stay at number two, but it's going to be

47:28.000 --> 47:38.400
a bigger number two than it was the last time around for them, so if they can take more

47:38.400 --> 47:43.680
of Sony's share, then they both can effectively win, you know what I mean?

47:43.680 --> 47:47.480
Any thoughts from you, Loki, on this?

47:47.480 --> 47:54.640
Of course, Microsoft say both them and Nintendo take the large share away from Sony.

47:54.640 --> 47:59.240
I'm sure they're not going to settle for number two, so you know, there will be a clear winner

47:59.240 --> 48:05.240
I think, but I don't know, I think the 360 is doing pretty good so far where they have

48:05.240 --> 48:12.440
kind of something for everybody, although the only casual games I've seen so far, mainly

48:12.440 --> 48:18.400
just on Xbox Live Arcade and even, well I guess Viva Pinata would be a casual game,

48:18.400 --> 48:19.400
but it sucks.

48:19.400 --> 48:23.560
I didn't think it was that bad, it's just different.

48:23.560 --> 48:26.760
It's not what you think it is, it's not for kids either, I didn't think a kid could

48:26.760 --> 48:29.920
get into that game, but anyway, that's beside the point.

48:29.920 --> 48:32.540
You know what else is interesting about this time around is I really think it's going

48:32.540 --> 48:34.320
to be different region to region.

48:34.320 --> 48:37.880
I think the UK is fucking pissed at Sony and they're probably not going to forgive them

48:37.880 --> 48:41.880
for it anytime soon, I don't see Sony doing very well there, but I see it doing better

48:41.880 --> 48:42.880
in Japan.

48:42.880 --> 48:47.320
I don't think the 360 is going to come out from third place in Japan anytime soon.

48:47.320 --> 48:52.000
Yes, you had Blue Dragon launch recently and yes, we all saw the people camped out in line,

48:52.000 --> 48:56.880
but they need more of that and they need it soon before the Playstation 3 starts delivering

48:56.880 --> 48:59.800
on that or they're going to be screwed.

48:59.800 --> 49:04.320
I think if Xbox really steps it up and puts out some quality stuff along the lines of

49:04.320 --> 49:08.760
those Blue Dragon type things, and it looks like we have the game based on Chopin, what

49:08.760 --> 49:12.960
was that game called, the Tumble Bell or something Bell?

49:12.960 --> 49:13.960
Trusty Bell.

49:13.960 --> 49:14.960
Trusty Bell, thank you, that's coming out.

49:14.960 --> 49:20.240
Some of the other games, maybe they're going in the right direction, but Microsoft needs

49:20.240 --> 49:23.560
to pick it up a little bit or else they're going to get their butt whipped by Sony, at

49:23.560 --> 49:24.560
least in Japan.

49:24.560 --> 49:30.000
But I think that's going to be interesting having different rankings throughout the world.

49:30.000 --> 49:34.800
That's what's going to make this generation of consoles different, in my opinion, and

49:34.800 --> 49:37.960
will ultimately affect the next generation of gaming.

49:37.960 --> 49:40.360
Lastly, a quick email.

49:40.360 --> 49:46.040
It wasn't signed with a handle, so we'll call him Nick S. Nick S. sent us an email.

49:46.040 --> 49:49.160
Hello, first I would like to compliment you on your podcast, I've been listening for a

49:49.160 --> 49:50.360
few months and love it.

49:50.360 --> 49:51.360
Thank you, appreciate it.

49:51.360 --> 49:55.360
I was wondering what you thought about Gears of War, because I would like to get OLR's

49:55.360 --> 49:56.360
opinions.

49:56.360 --> 50:00.200
PS, every time I'm holding my PSP, I'm always listening to you, OLR, you're all the best

50:00.200 --> 50:01.200
gamers I know.

50:01.200 --> 50:03.200
That's very sweet, thank you.

50:03.200 --> 50:08.160
Gears of War, you know, I thought I talked about this on the show a little bit previously,

50:08.160 --> 50:09.900
but I'll say it again.

50:09.900 --> 50:17.040
It's a pretty game, and it's a kick-ass co-op game, but it didn't really click for me.

50:17.040 --> 50:20.920
I'm not feeling all the praise that everybody else is lavishing upon it.

50:20.920 --> 50:25.440
It wasn't ultimately very much fun for me, and I got frustrated with the controls.

50:25.440 --> 50:29.960
I felt like I wasn't really understanding what I was doing throughout a lot of the game,

50:29.960 --> 50:33.240
and it's not like I haven't played first-person shooters before, okay, I've played Halo, I

50:33.240 --> 50:38.480
beat Prey, you know, well of course any idiot can beat Prey, but you know, it just really

50:38.480 --> 50:40.120
wasn't my kind of game.

50:40.120 --> 50:45.240
But I've always been more into music games, action games, you know, first-person shooters

50:45.240 --> 50:51.440
have usually been a little lower on what I like, but I didn't enjoy Gears of War as much

50:51.440 --> 50:56.800
as even frickin' Prey I thought was more fun to play for me, and you know, but maybe that's

50:56.800 --> 51:00.400
because Gears of War isn't quite the same traditional shooter, either.

51:00.400 --> 51:04.640
You know, it's cover, shoot, cover, shoot, and a lot of the game has to do with covering,

51:04.640 --> 51:08.560
and maybe I'm just more into the, you know, kamikaze type of playing.

51:08.560 --> 51:09.560
Leeward Jenkins!

51:09.560 --> 51:11.640
I'm that guy, you know?

51:11.640 --> 51:15.560
Well, I wasn't really into the game either, but then again I haven't really played it

51:15.560 --> 51:23.160
enough to give a fair shake yet, but my coworker just finally got a 360, and he bought actually

51:23.160 --> 51:27.760
Gears of War as well, and he said that he hasn't been able to pass the first tutorial

51:27.760 --> 51:31.960
stage yet, he says it's fuckin' hard, and he's playing on the simplest difficulty, and

51:31.960 --> 51:35.080
he plays a lot of first-person shooters.

51:35.080 --> 51:38.600
It's not EDI, that even like held me up for a little bit too, I finally got out of the

51:38.600 --> 51:42.620
stupid tutorial level, but I, you know, the first, it's just, I don't know.

51:42.620 --> 51:45.600
Of course, I haven't, now admittedly I have not played enough of the co-op.

51:45.600 --> 51:49.440
I think that's my biggest problem, because that's where most people seem to be lovin'

51:49.440 --> 51:53.320
Gears of War, is co-op, and you know, I'll give it that, you know, I'll trust my friends'

51:53.320 --> 51:57.420
assessments on that, and hopefully I'll get some friends someday, and I can play Gears

51:57.420 --> 51:58.420
of War co-op.

51:58.420 --> 51:59.420
That'll be fun.

51:59.420 --> 52:02.580
If I can tear myself away from burnout this week, we'll see.

52:02.580 --> 52:03.580
That's it for the mailbag!

52:03.580 --> 52:07.480
If you want to send some emails, we'd love to hear from you, and sorry, you know, we

52:07.480 --> 52:11.240
weren't able to read every email we got this week on the air, but DarkSakura does make

52:11.240 --> 52:14.640
an effort to always read all the email, and you know, when she's out, I'll step in and

52:14.640 --> 52:16.120
try to read and respond to the email.

52:16.120 --> 52:19.600
We'd love to hear from you guys, and it really keeps us going here at Orange Lontredo, so

52:19.600 --> 52:20.600
we appreciate it.

52:20.600 --> 52:21.600
Thanks, you guys.

52:21.600 --> 52:22.600
Back to the news.

52:22.600 --> 52:30.440
Anyway, so, I swear to God, I've had so many co-workers come up to me and go, hey, have

52:30.440 --> 52:36.680
you heard about those crazy Wii straps breaking, and people breaking their TVs with the Wii

52:36.680 --> 52:37.680
Mode?

52:37.680 --> 52:38.680
And all this...

52:38.680 --> 52:47.160
I mean, it's like ridiculous how much this has been spun out of proportion, just... it's

52:47.160 --> 52:52.160
idiots basically throwing the Wii Mode, you know, at 90 miles an hour, and going, why

52:52.160 --> 52:55.120
did it break and smash my TV?

52:55.120 --> 52:58.880
Maybe because you're trying to throw a real 90 mile an hour fastball in baseball when

52:58.880 --> 53:03.520
you really don't have to, and it says in the manual, you know, make the movement slightly.

53:03.520 --> 53:06.040
You don't have to, you know, do it really hard.

53:06.040 --> 53:13.760
Anyways, that being said, Nintendo has actually gone ahead and fixed the straps.

53:13.760 --> 53:19.720
They're a lot thicker now, and you can actually find them starting with the Australia launch,

53:19.720 --> 53:21.960
and in the Wii Play bundle.

53:21.960 --> 53:27.200
They have new straps, and if you really want to, if you've broken your straps, you can

53:27.200 --> 53:29.880
probably buy them on the Nintendo store.

53:29.880 --> 53:35.440
And so, yeah, the new remotes are going to have new straps that will be...

53:35.440 --> 53:37.600
All it is is kind of just a knot tied around the controller.

53:37.600 --> 53:42.080
Couldn't you just get your own little, you know, steel cable type thing that won't hurt

53:42.080 --> 53:43.080
your hand?

53:43.080 --> 53:46.120
People have been using fishing line, and just basically have done it that way.

53:46.120 --> 53:47.760
That sounds like it would hurt, though.

53:47.760 --> 53:49.880
You know, because remember, this stuff's going to press up against your wrist.

53:49.880 --> 53:50.880
You don't want anything that's too...

53:50.880 --> 53:56.560
No, replacing the little string that goes from the actual strap to fishing line, so

53:56.560 --> 53:59.560
I'm...

53:59.560 --> 54:00.560
Personally just don't...

54:00.560 --> 54:02.040
Do that crap at your own risk, though.

54:02.040 --> 54:03.040
Exactly.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.040
Or don't throw the damn remote.

54:04.040 --> 54:06.520
I mean, seriously, if you're going to...

54:06.520 --> 54:07.520
Don't let go of it.

54:07.520 --> 54:09.200
You're not supposed to let go of it.

54:09.200 --> 54:14.400
They've got, you know, covers in case, you know, your hands get sweaty, like...

54:14.400 --> 54:18.040
My hands have never gotten that sweaty, I mean, and shit, I...

54:18.040 --> 54:21.040
Right before I'm playing the Wii or something, I'm eating, you know, fucking fast food, and

54:21.040 --> 54:24.960
my hands are all greasy from french fries, so if that shit doesn't make the, you know,

54:24.960 --> 54:27.800
the Wii remote fly out of my hands, then nothing will.

54:27.800 --> 54:34.800
So if you're really that clumsy and are prone to throwing shit through windows and TVs,

54:34.800 --> 54:39.960
then maybe you shouldn't, I don't know, buy a Wii, or maybe you should duct tape that

54:39.960 --> 54:42.040
shit to your arm, I don't know.

54:42.040 --> 54:45.560
Jeremy Todd, one in our chat room, says a friend bought four new straps on Nintendo's

54:45.560 --> 54:49.080
website for $6.24 including shipping.

54:49.080 --> 54:51.960
Chat dot orange launch radio dot com if you want to leave your own comments.

54:51.960 --> 54:55.320
If you're listening live here on Sunday night, which we tape live 6pm at orange launch radio

54:55.320 --> 54:58.220
dot com every week.

54:58.220 --> 55:01.400
By the way, component cables in stock on their wrist.

55:01.400 --> 55:05.080
I just ordered from Nintendo as well, and I haven't checked the tracking of them, the

55:05.080 --> 55:07.840
last I checked they were in Portland, so I should be getting them next week.

55:07.840 --> 55:08.840
Very excited.

55:08.840 --> 55:09.840
Mine coming Monday.

55:09.840 --> 55:10.840
Very excited.

55:10.840 --> 55:11.840
Then I'm going to play more Zelda.

55:11.840 --> 55:14.160
I've kind of held off from Zelda because I won't play it until it's as pretty as it's

55:14.160 --> 55:15.160
going to get.

55:15.160 --> 55:17.240
I'm stupid like that, don't listen to me.

55:17.240 --> 55:20.820
Black Wolf comments, Nintendo investigating the wrist traps means that they admit there

55:20.820 --> 55:23.880
is a problem which will open themselves up to lawsuits.

55:23.880 --> 55:27.560
Rama counters, I doubt it though, Nintendo said not to be rough with it.

55:27.560 --> 55:28.560
They did send out an email.

55:28.560 --> 55:31.120
Did you get the email from Nintendo this week?

55:31.120 --> 55:35.200
I got an email from Nintendo that was posted, bloggers got it too, and it was posted all

55:35.200 --> 55:38.520
over and it said, we hope you're enjoying the Wii, but be careful with it.

55:38.520 --> 55:44.680
I didn't get the email, but here, come on, really though, it says like 50,000 times when

55:44.680 --> 55:48.800
you're playing Wii Sports, make sure the wrist strap is securely fastened.

55:48.800 --> 55:50.660
Shouldn't you be taking a break?

55:50.660 --> 55:53.000
Make sure you're not swinging this around wildly.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.160
Be careful of others.

55:54.160 --> 55:58.040
I think they have done everything in their power to make sure that you do not throw that.

55:58.040 --> 56:02.360
If you're just a fucking idiot and want to go ahead and throw your damn remote, you're

56:02.360 --> 56:03.560
the only one to blame.

56:03.560 --> 56:09.400
Do not fucking try to sue Nintendo because you were dumb and decided, oh, I'm going to

56:09.400 --> 56:13.520
let go of the remote while I'm bullying and it went through your goddamn TV.

56:13.520 --> 56:19.160
I mean, seriously, if you're that stupid, and I imagine there will be someone that sues

56:19.160 --> 56:23.040
I didn't know it would fly out of my hand, I thought this tiny piece of string would

56:23.040 --> 56:24.720
keep it from anything.

56:24.720 --> 56:30.240
I thought I could swing it around like a goddamn lasso.

56:30.240 --> 56:32.280
People are so goddamn retarded.

56:32.280 --> 56:37.360
Okay, I'm just going to, devil's advocate, do the games encourage this behavior?

56:37.360 --> 56:42.440
No, I don't think they do because they show you, even like for example Rayman's Raving

56:42.440 --> 56:47.660
Rabbids, when they're showing you how to play it, they show you, you know, holding the remote,

56:47.660 --> 56:49.680
they don't show you wildly swinging around.

56:49.680 --> 56:52.340
They show you just kind of making small little movements.

56:52.340 --> 56:57.520
The wrist strap is around the goddamn bunny's hand, so it is encouraging the proper use

56:57.520 --> 56:58.520
of this.

56:58.520 --> 57:02.480
And nowhere does it say in the game to swing as fast as possible.

57:02.480 --> 57:06.980
It says in the Wii Sports manual, and I know no one reads the manual anymore, but it says

57:06.980 --> 57:10.160
it in there to, you know, swing lightly.

57:10.160 --> 57:14.440
You know, you do not need to do, you do not need to swing it wildly.

57:14.440 --> 57:16.560
I don't know what more they could possibly do.

57:16.560 --> 57:19.920
I mean, Wii Sports seems to be the one that's been the biggest culprit.

57:19.920 --> 57:23.340
You know, baseball, because people are trying to throw a fastball, because you don't exactly

57:23.340 --> 57:27.600
throw pitches in Zelda, you know, and that's the other huge game right now.

57:27.600 --> 57:32.440
So it's basically that game, and it's just people don't get it.

57:32.440 --> 57:35.560
They don't get that you're not actually playing the real thing.

57:35.560 --> 57:40.360
You don't need to throw, I mean, and granted when I was playing baseball, you know, I was

57:40.360 --> 57:45.440
trying to, you know, throw it hard, but you realize after a little bit, you're all, wait,

57:45.440 --> 57:46.440
I don't need to do that.

57:46.440 --> 57:49.880
I can just kind of flick my wrist, and it does the same thing.

57:49.880 --> 57:53.200
So it's just stupid people.

57:53.200 --> 57:54.480
Alright, well, speaking of...

57:54.480 --> 57:55.480
Ruining it for everyone.

57:55.480 --> 57:59.880
Speaking of stupid, you'd be awfully stupid to buy point cards from Toys R Us, at least

57:59.880 --> 58:04.800
the ones that have been marking up their 2,000 point cards to $24.99.

58:04.800 --> 58:06.320
That's what they're charging on the internet as well.

58:06.320 --> 58:12.680
Now keep in mind, 2,000 Wii points, you can buy on your Wii for 20 bucks.

58:12.680 --> 58:15.840
So you'd be kind of dumb to buy this from Toys R Us.

58:15.840 --> 58:20.240
Now Mieklatov, he had to leave the show because he had a pretty bad headache, but I know he

58:20.240 --> 58:23.680
wanted to point out that they were at Best Buy or Target something earlier, and they

58:23.680 --> 58:25.040
saw the same thing going on there.

58:25.040 --> 58:29.580
So this isn't just Toys R Us, it's just people have caught Toys R Us because it's online.

58:29.580 --> 58:34.280
So a lot of folks are selling these things online for more money.

58:34.280 --> 58:40.160
And you know what's actually kind of interesting though, I remember originally when we had

58:40.160 --> 58:45.880
our, when we were adding the SKUs for the Wii stuff before launch, the Wii point cards

58:45.880 --> 58:46.880
were $24, $25.

58:46.880 --> 58:50.200
And I was like, what the fuck, that doesn't make any sense because they're supposed to

58:50.200 --> 58:55.560
be, you know, it's a dollar for every point, or a penny for every point basically.

58:55.560 --> 58:59.560
And I wouldn't be surprised because the margin, as I mentioned on other shows, the margin

58:59.560 --> 59:05.480
of Nintendo products right now because they're trying to make an extreme profit on this stuff

59:05.480 --> 59:06.480
is nothing.

59:06.480 --> 59:13.480
I mean, the price that Best Buy probably pays for this stuff is like $16, and they're making

59:13.480 --> 59:16.960
only $4 off of this thing.

59:16.960 --> 59:18.640
Or it might even be even less than that.

59:18.640 --> 59:24.960
I think it's really like $2 is what they're making off of this stuff, and even less on

59:24.960 --> 59:26.700
controllers and other stuff.

59:26.700 --> 59:31.200
So the fact that they're charging more, you know, granted, yeah, that's not very good,

59:31.200 --> 59:35.360
but the average mom and pop that are buying these things, they don't know how much they're

59:35.360 --> 59:37.720
supposed to cost, and they're going to pay that price.

59:37.720 --> 59:41.200
Do you think Costco would be selling these even cheaper?

59:41.200 --> 59:45.880
Because Costco's notorious for selling things very, very little above cost.

59:45.880 --> 59:50.380
Do you think you could possibly get a $19 card at Costco?

59:50.380 --> 59:53.640
You might be able to, I'm not sure though, it depends.

59:53.640 --> 59:58.440
Because if their margins are that small, they might not sell it at a loss, or that little.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.720
I mean, they might just sell it at the normal price.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:06.320
But I'm not surprised, though, that you're seeing people charging $24 for these things.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:12.240
It's just the same reason why you see mad cats charging $60 for fucking component cables,

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:16.720
when I can buy React's component cables for $19.99.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:21.020
Or fuck, they have official Nintendo ones for like $29.99.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.920
So they're just paying off people who don't know any better?

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:27.920
Yeah, they're paying off people that are buying these stuff as a gift for their kids, or for

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.080
Christmas, and they don't know how much this is supposed to cost.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:35.600
And I guess their excuse would be, it's a convenience for our customers, because little

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.920
Bobby does not have a credit card.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.920
So we're...

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:42.320
And to be honest, I think it's a rip-off to buy them at retail anyways, because you're

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.120
paying tax on $20.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.120
So just buy it online.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:49.280
Well, no, the weird thing is, I could have sworn I saw the Wii in some places was charging

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.280
tax.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.040
Like I saw a screenshot where somebody was being charged tax on the points, but I'm not

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.060
charged tax here.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.900
It says you can, there's a tax thing on there.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:02.320
I'm not sure if it's for that per se, but there's a little tax thing on there where

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.480
you could be charged tax.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.800
It's like a little spot for it, but so far they're not.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.480
Maybe they're only taxing if you live in Washington, since that's where they're based?

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.480
I don't know.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.680
I don't think so, it's...

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.680
I don't know.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.680
No idea.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.320
I could swear I saw a YouTube video where someone was being charged tax.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.320
I don't know.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.640
Because I remember commenting, oh that sucks, Xbox doesn't charge you tax.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.760
Like I remember commenting on that, and I was kind of mad at Nintendo, but then when

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.600
I actually went to buy the points, I was not charged.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.600
I'm stealing a fry.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.480
If you're going to bring food in here, I'm stealing a fry.

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:34.480
It's popcorn shrimp.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.400
Well, I'm still stealing a fry that comes with the shrimp.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.960
Anyway.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.560
Moving on, while I chow down here.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:49.560
So speaking of Nintendo, not a huge surprise.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:53.280
They were a little short on their UK Wii shipment.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.360
Hold on, I'm sorry.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:00.840
Pennsylvania is being charged the tax, and BlackWolf says I must have seen the video

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:05.880
on Joystiq because they have the tax in Pennsylvania, and that's where I guess the Joystiq video

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.880
came from.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.680
Possibly, it's one of like 50 game blogs I read, so probably that is where I saw the

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.680
video.

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.680
Interesting though.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:20.120
Anyways, so they apparently weren't able to ship all the units for the Wii for the launch,

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:27.680
but they are shipping more each week to hopefully be able to catch up before Christmas and get

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.600
as many units out there as possible.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.720
With the whole launch this year, and even last year with the 360, it's not a big surprise

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:40.280
that they're short, and from what I read, they weren't short by that much.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.200
It was only maybe 1,000 units or whatever.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.360
It's not too bad.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:51.240
It's not like the 200,000 units of, say, the PlayStation 3, which couldn't even hit the

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:58.440
200,000 unit mark and ended up being 197,000 units, so whatever.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:04.640
But hopefully, you know what, UK, at least you're getting the system on time, because

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.840
you sure as hell don't have the PlayStation.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.240
On time-ish.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:13.560
On time-ish, but you're still not, I mean, a couple days is a lot better than, say, a

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.560
couple months.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.560
Well, Nintendo is trying to make nice a little bit.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.160
They have screwed over Europe constantly in the past, but now Europe is viewing this as,

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.040
hey, we're getting screwed again.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.100
All our consoles are going to the targets in America.

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:29.100
You know I was at GameStop today, I'll say who it was, I don't care, I was at GameStop

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:33.400
today and I heard the clerk tell somebody, we're not really getting the Wiis in a lot,

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.120
you'd have better luck over at Target.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:39.560
I was like, wow, that's a pretty, it's a good thing I'm not a secret shopper.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:43.600
I probably would have, you know, FFFF on that guy.

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.400
I was pretty surprised to hear that.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.880
I tell my customers that shit all the time, like when we had the 360s, when they first

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.880
launched.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:53.640
I'm like, dude, Best Buy's got them right now, I'm all, you can go down there, pick

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.560
them up, because they were just turning around and selling them for like twice as much to

01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:02.280
their customers, but, you know, I helped the guys score a couple Xbox 360s.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.440
Wow, interesting.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.440
I thought that was kind of interesting, anyway.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:11.760
Well, I hope you folks in the UK are enjoying your system.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.360
Nobody answered the call last week where we asked some of our British listeners to tape

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.120
folks in line that were waiting for the Wii.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.580
No, no, they went to other game blogs instead.

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:26.180
We all saw the, you know, Germany crowd and Kotaku and all that other stuff, but nobody

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:30.800
loves us, but that's fine, we'll try not to be too butter over it.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:36.440
Something that you should be aware of if you are in the CPL, that would be the Cyber Athlete

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.600
Professional League, they're going to be drug testing you at the start of gaming competitions

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.600
next year.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.960
I'm sorry, that doesn't necessarily mean at the start of every competition, I just mean

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.640
at next year they will be testing for this.

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.600
It's kind of interesting because, you know, they're going to be testing for drugs, but

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:55.920
the comparison people are making is that, wow, it's like real sports.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:59.800
Games are becoming closer and closer to being real sports, you know.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.320
Can steroids enhance your game playing abilities?

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.940
So I suppose, you know, I suppose some drugs could make your reaction times better.

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:11.080
Let me get this very, very clear.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:14.720
Video games are not a sport.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:19.880
They will never, ever, ever be a sport.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:26.120
This is including anything with the Wii, because granted you're moving around, okay.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:30.800
The closest thing you may come to a sport, I guess, is Dance Dance Revolution, but that's

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.520
even still not even close.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.040
Games are not a sport.

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.440
Football is a sport.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:42.600
Deaf says not even Wii Sports.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.600
Football is a sport.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:48.240
Basketball is a sport, you know.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.920
DARTED SUYA says DDR is a sport.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.100
Not really.

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.840
In some foreign country out there, what was it?

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.840
Oh, that's right.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.360
Was it Switzerland or something made it a sport?

01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.840
Finland or something, I don't know.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.160
Sorry, pardon our ignorance, folks.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.200
We don't remember who it was.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:07.880
That's kind of a funny story, though, that they're testing for drugs and stuff.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:17.080
There is another article that missed our cut here, talking about soda highs in gamers.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:26.000
Apparently caffeine is the gaming drug of choice, and they're talking about the description.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.560
Caffeine absorption is complete.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:32.780
Your pupils dilate, your blood pressure rises, and as a response, your liver dumps more sugar

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:36.720
into your bloodstream.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.720
That's funny.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.440
Caffeine is a drug?

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.520
Well, they can't really be testing for caffeine.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.520
It's a legal drug.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:48.920
If I want to drink a jumbo-sized coffee before I go play games, that's my right.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.920
It's a legal drug.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.920
I'm not doing anything wrong.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:51.920
True.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:52.920
I don't know.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:07:00.880
I'd love to see them taking steroids if they throw the remotes through TVs and stuff.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:01.880
That'd be hilarious.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:06.360
I somehow doubt that.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.920
There's actually some pretty cool stuff.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:14.040
There was some sort of charity event where they were giving away a custom Guitar Hero

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:17.720
controller that was made out of a real guitar.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:23.400
If you're interested in doing that, Kotaku linked to a story which basically has a how-to

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.400
on how you can do that.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.000
I know this was also run on Hackaday and stuff like that.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:35.320
The story actually comes from Toolmonger, so if you want to check it out, it's toolmonger.com.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:39.920
It's how to build your own custom full-size wireless Guitar Hero controller.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:51.160
It basically requires you to take apart a Guitar Hero controller and an actual guitar.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.160
Pretty cool.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.200
You can make some pretty sweet looking guitars from that.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:59.000
It seems like a lot of money to burn just for a stupid controller.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.640
It's just two games.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:03.080
Well true, but you know what though?

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.080
I'm over Guitar Hero.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.160
I am so over Guitar Hero, at least until the 360 version.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.720
I am so over it.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:19.880
People were buying the full-size arcade units for the Guitar Freaks, the arcade-style controllers.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.560
Argue if you will, which is the better game, Guitar Freaks or Guitar Hero.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:25.720
I don't really care, but at least Guitar Freaks has slightly more games available.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:26.720
At least there's what?

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.160
Like you have Guitar Freaks V and then you only have four games for it.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.840
There's Guitar Freaks 3 and 4, Guitar Freaks V, there's a server collection, 3-2.

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:38.920
And the fact that Guitar Freaks had an arcade machine that most people played on before

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:42.800
they played the home version, so people want to recreate that arcade experience at home.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:46.720
Guitar Hero had no arcade machine.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.720
I don't know.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:50.360
It just seems a little silly.

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.840
It's a lot of money.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:58.040
You can feed the starving children, if you think back to the story on the PlayStation

01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.040
3 cost.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:05.280
Anyway, I wanted to point this out as well, speaking of music games.

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.920
Big news in the DDR world this week.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.840
Not only is DDR now being promoted through Burger King, of all things, did you see the

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.840
little toy?

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.380
Miklotov actually got one of the little toys.

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:19.440
It's the Dancing Boldo that you can press the little button and he does the little disco

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:20.440
dance.

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.440
It's all kinds of stupid.

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:27.880
But the other big news, if you've been following DDR for a couple of years, then you know that

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:32.620
folks were able to find that somewhere on the DDR extreme disk, the song Memories was

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.960
hidden away.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:37.120
And people were figuring out for years, how are we going to get this song?

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.940
How's this song supposed to be unlocked?

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:42.560
And everybody thought, oh, maybe it'll be unlocked when Supernova comes out.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.640
There'll be some type of link data, whatever it is.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:50.360
Well, turns out, sure enough, this week an unlock code was released through the Burger

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:52.000
King promotion for Memories.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.240
So you can finally unlock it legitimately, not using any type of Game Genie style hacks.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.480
You can actually unlock it legitimately in DDR Extreme US.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:07.240
You just plug a controller in port 2, right 4 times, up 3 times, square 1 time, left 2

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:11.400
times, down 3 times, square 2 times, and select 1 time.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.600
Hopefully you got all that written down.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.320
If not, you can go over to Burger King's website for the DDR promotion and play the stupid

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.320
little game they have.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.480
And when you beat the game, you'll get the code.

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.800
So you can finally have Memories in that game.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:22.840
Now here's my thought.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.280
I don't think they waited two years for this.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:30.520
I think this is how they've remedied the situation that was created when the link data in Supernova

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.560
kind of fell through, because you notice it was removed from the final version.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.360
So there's no link data and no Supernova.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.980
I bet you anything that was how it was supposed to happen.

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:44.880
But because it didn't happen this way, you got the debug code instead.

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.880
Makes sense.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:49.120
I would bet money that that's what happened.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.620
I would bet money.

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:51.720
And I swear I don't know anything.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.240
I realize we have folks from Konami that come on the program, but they haven't told me anything.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.400
That's my personal thought.

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.320
All right.

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.480
That's all the news we have for you tonight, but we do want to take some of your calls

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.040
because we're an interactive program.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.040
So why don't you give us a call.

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:07.040
Are you using?

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.040
Oh.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.040
I want to do one thing.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.040
Here.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.040
Yeah?

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.040
Website of the week.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040
Okay.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040
Oh, sure.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.040
Well, then hold on.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.560
I have to get some theme music for you if you want a website of the week.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:21.040
Unfortunately, I don't have Jamie's typical song loaded, so you get this.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:24.280
I hate you.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.280
Anyways.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.280
Loki's website of the week.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.320
I thought this would be cool.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.800
They just ran a story about this thing that they've got going for Nintendo.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:38.600
It's actually for like a Christmas calendar type thing.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.600
It's mission-in-snowdriftland.com.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.600
Drift.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.600
Yeah.

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:42.600
Funny.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:53.040
But it's a bunch of little mini games that you can play, and it's counting down to Christmas.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.080
And I don't know what exactly it is, but each game is kind of like Mario.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.480
What was the website again?

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:05.760
It's www.mission-in-snowdriftland.com.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:11.520
They've got a game for each calendar day, and of course, each one is unlocked as the

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.520
day's gone.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.520
All right.

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:18.400
Loki's website of the week, boys and girls.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.960
Temporarily this week's The Stark Soccer is on vacation.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.240
All right.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.600
Let's go to another call on Skype here.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.320
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.320
Who's this?

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.320
Raven's Dolphin.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.320
Hi, Raven's Dolphin.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.320
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:39.520
The HDTVs and that lawsuit, I've been actually reading up on it.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.920
What do you have to say about it?

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:45.000
They just seem like they're just out for money.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.120
I said it before.

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:53.000
The trigger runs through Bluetooth.ir, and this thing is not motion sensitive.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:00.320
It's just through this crappy D-pad, and it looks like a smart text phaser.

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:05.480
Why do you think they are, then, if they don't believe that they have this product first?

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.200
Why do you think they're going through with this lawsuit, which is not a cheap process?

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:14.880
I know that, but I think the goal is really because they're babies.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:20.280
I guess the CEO's here, he's going to his kid, I want a Wii, I want a Wii, I can't get

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.280
a Wii.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.280
So let's sue Nintendo.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.280
Oh, come on.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.960
You're thinking because some guy at this company could not get a Wii that they're going to

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.960
sue Nintendo?

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.080
That's a little bit far-fetched, don't you think?

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:36.320
A little, but it's just, it's this thing, you know, do you believe that they're actually

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.320
going to win?

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.320
I don't.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:43.560
I don't think so, either, because the controller is a lot more intricate, but, you know, what

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.560
do I know?

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.560
And one more thing.

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:46.560
Yes?

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.560
Have you even heard of this company?

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.020
Have I even heard of what?

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:52.020
The company.

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:53.020
The company, literally.

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:54.020
Have you ever heard of it?

01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:57.180
No, but they don't make game products, so they don't make something I follow, but apparently

01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:02.420
they make PowerPoint push-button thingers for people who give lectures, like myself.

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:05.960
You think I would have heard of them, but mine comes through the projector, which is

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.740
made by, who is our projector, In Focus.

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.600
Here's a question, though, Rob.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.840
Does the Wii do PowerPoint presentations?

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.280
No, it doesn't.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.840
Granted, you could probably use the photo channel for that, but that's beyond the point.

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:21.460
No, I think the fact that the trigger uses Bluetooth and the other one's infrared is

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:22.460
going to be the end of this lawsuit.

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:27.400
The thing is, though, is they have a patent for, like, game controller device or whatever

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.400
like that.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:31.720
This is a patent for new remote control for PC.

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:35.320
I think it's going to be completely different, and they're probably going to throw it out

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.320
once this comes in.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:42.640
Hey, you know what, Raven's Dolphin, Raven's Dolphin, uh, Black Wolf in our chat room is

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:48.680
accusing you of stealing the Wii for the kid joke from his show and is threatening a lawsuit.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:52.200
Uh, Black Wolf, yeah, I have.

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.200
Oh.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.200
Ah!

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.200
I'm sorry, Black Wolf.

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.200
Kiss me later.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:00.360
All right, well, now you have to plug Black Wolf Show, or else we're all getting sued.

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.640
Fine, I'll listen tonight.

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:06.920
Bobby Black Wolf Show, uh, 8 o'clock on Sunday nights before Orange Lounge.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.920
That's 8 o'clock Eastern.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:08.920
5 o'clock Pacific.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:09.920
5 o'clock Pacific.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.920
All right, there you go.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.480
All right, uh, any other quick thoughts, Raven's Dolphin, before we get some more call?

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:20.280
Yeah, one quick, uh, if I was going to buy an HDTV, I'm just going to bring in my Xbox

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.800
360, hook it up to one of the televisions, and see how it looks on there.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.400
Tweeter said I could do that.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.600
Well, then there you go.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.800
If the store will let you do that, then go for it.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:31.800
That's what I'm going to do.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.040
I'm not going to sit there and go, hmm, does this look good?

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.680
No, I want to see it firsthand.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:38.120
All right, well, have fun with that, Raven's Dolphin.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.720
We got to get some more calls, but thank you so much for your phone call.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.080
We appreciate it.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.080
Let's go to some more phone calls here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.760
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:47.760
Who's this?

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:48.760
Hey, guys.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.360
This is Footy Monster.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:51.360
Hey, Footy Monster.

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.360
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:57.600
I just wanted to go on about the whole Wiimote accident thing.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.600
Uh, sure.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.600
What about it?

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:05.880
Well, basically, if they do seem to know about the Wiimote accidents, shouldn't they sue

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:11.320
like baseball-making company persons and like people who play soccer on the street and hear

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:14.640
a person on the head with a ball or something?

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.480
No one's going to get sued over, I mean, have there actually been any lawsuits yet on this

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.480
yet?

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.720
I'm not hearing that there actually has been a lawsuit on this yet, but they'd be so stupid

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:27.360
because exactly the point that Footy Monster's bringing up here, you know what?

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:32.080
Accidents with toys happen around the house all the time, and do they get sued over it?

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:36.320
No, not unless the toy, you know, starts a fire, but that's a little different.

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.720
I haven't heard of any lawsuits yet.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.400
If you actually go to Engadget, there is a picture of a boy who was playing with the

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:49.040
cousins with a Wii, and one of the kids was playing a baseball game, Wii Sports, and hitting

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:55.560
on the head with a Wiimote, and he has a whole mark on his forehead from the Wiimote, and

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.560
it's going to start happening.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:01.440
There's going to be parents suing Nintendo about the Wiimote and their children's game.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:06.080
But at the same time, Wii Sports shows a disclaimer right before you go into the game, and it

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:11.360
even shows the guy spinning around going, make sure there is nothing around you before

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:15.920
you start playing this game, and that would, you know, include your, you know, little brother.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:19.040
So they were at fault for not reading the disclaimer, honestly.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:25.040
I mean, you know, sucks to be the kid, but, you know, don't run at somebody who's flailing

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.920
their arms about like crazy.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:27.920
You know?

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.880
Well, it's still, yeah, but it doesn't prevent the bad publicity, I mean, it doesn't prevent

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:36.800
any of the jacky-poos of the world going all over it about how, you know, Nintendo hurts

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:37.800
children.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:41.480
I'll give you that, it doesn't do any good for Nintendo's publicity, but somebody needs

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:46.120
to put their foot down and say, look, Nintendo is not, you know, these guys are just being

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.120
idiots.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.120
Yeah, I agree.

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:52.920
Well, that's all I wanted to say, and just kind of make it quick, give you a week?

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:53.920
Sure, sure.

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:54.920
Why not?

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:59.560
Okay, my little brother has the chicken pox, I never got him before, so I'm 23 and I'm

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.560
about to get him.

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:04.560
Uh-oh, run for the hills, you don't want that at the age of 23.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:08.840
So you don't get chicken pox, you get shingles, that's always the question.

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:14.120
Oh, yuck, gross, gross, alright, stay far away, we'll pray or something that you don't

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.120
get it.

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.120
Okay, guys.

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:19.680
Alright, have a good one, buddy, and stay away from chicken pox.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.800
Good to see you guys, thanks.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.920
Well, I had it when I was seven, so I don't have to worry, did you have chicken pox when

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:25.920
you were younger?

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:26.920
I've never gotten them.

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:27.920
Oh, shit, you better be careful.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.920
I said I've gotten them four times, I think I'm just...

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.480
How can you get chicken pox four times?

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.320
I don't know.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.720
Are you sure it's just not Herbie's?

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:34.840
No, it's chicken pox.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:36.720
Did you have them four times?

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:41.400
I purposely stayed around her to try to get them, and I never caught them, so I'm immune.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:47.240
One eight seven seven game O-L-R is our 800 number, or you can call us on Skype, Orange

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:49.600
Lounge Radio is the username.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:57.160
I've also never had my gallbladder out, and I've also my appendix, and my tonsils are

01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:02.160
all in too, and I have all my wisdom teeth too.

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.800
I am one whole person.

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:05.800
Let's go to a call.

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.280
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who this?

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:10.800
You obviously know who this is, Legend of Zaku.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:14.760
Well, hi, Legend of Zaku, but you see it's radio, and on the radio they can't see my

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.240
little Skype screen that shows me who's calling, and to be honest, I usually, I'll just click

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:21.280
the button, and whoever happens to be up gets lucky.

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:25.400
Unless somebody's calling repeatedly throughout the show, I'll not pick them up, but anyway,

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:28.280
you got lucky, your call got through, what do you want to say?

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:35.600
Well, basically, I want to throw out this question before anything.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:44.240
Suppose that someone or something, some entity, were supposed to want to create a game on

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:53.760
a mobile cell phone, more like they want to create a rhythm based game, what would be

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:57.360
the best way, in your honest opinion, on how to approach this?

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:01.600
You don't, not in this country on these phones, don't put out a rhythm based game.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:05.520
Wait, wait, wait, no, before you say that, I happen to work with these phones.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:12.600
Okay, no, I understand, and you know what, phones are almost there, because we have phones

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:16.800
that can play the MP3s and all that stuff, but right now they don't really do it through,

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:21.680
unless you know something I don't, they don't really play the CD quality songs through the

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:22.960
little Java games.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.860
Yeah, but that's the thing.

01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:29.760
It's not supposed to be that sophisticated, it's supposed to be within the capacity of

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:30.760
the cell phone.

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:41.080
Now, I'm going to rephrase it, assuming within the maximum capacity of a cell phone, how

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.260
would you approach the situation?

01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:49.840
Keep in mind that most phones can't even do simultaneous key presses.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:55.360
My suggestion then would be not to approach it as a music game, but make it about the

01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:08.440
timing that maybe could be set to music, something along those lines where maybe it's about pressing

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:13.080
the keys at the right time or whatever, but even then, I don't know, I honestly can't

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.840
imagine a game like that being too incredibly thrilling.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:19.120
I don't know, maybe if I had some nice visuals or something.

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:24.560
What about feature wise, like internet ranking or downloadable content?

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.960
Sure why not, downloadable stuff, internet, all that stuff is good.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:34.520
Yeah, basically more like a game and a personalization app at the same time.

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:40.160
Okay sure, I can see, I can look at the rankings or whatever, that's always fun I guess.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:43.280
Alright, well there you have it, what was your other question, we've got to keep moving,

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:45.160
what else was on your mind?

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:51.240
I don't know, I've been talking to Rama recently, and I know this was something else.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:58.280
By the way, sorry, completely different topic, Rama, I saw Rama on GameTap TV, I was just

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.240
kind of curious what kind of stuff they were showing on GameTap TV, and if you go to their

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:07.200
recent, I don't know, whatever it is that Victor Lucas hosts, the GameTap news thing

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:13.080
or whatever the heck it is, you can see Rama for like a split second in this little montage

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:16.800
of what was going on at the Wii launch, and I would have missed him if it wasn't for the

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:22.360
fact that he's the only black Luigi I know anywhere, so you can spot him on my way.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:25.840
Anyway, sorry, so about your conversations with Rama.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:32.880
Let me see, I know we were planning to do, in other words, I don't know if you guys would,

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:39.360
let's say that, to put it this way, I've been having conversations where there's various

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:44.680
other DDR players on something that we plan to do for charity, it hasn't been set in stone

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:51.040
yet, but we need more support and backing, and basically, in the event that this does

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:57.400
happen, I don't know how much support you're willing to give us, if any.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:01.560
Well we'll consider anything, just send us an email and we'll see what we can do.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.560
It's a charity thing?

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.560
Right.

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:04.560
Usually we're going to do that.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:12.060
We're planning to do something along that line, some sort of gaming event for a cause.

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:17.840
Is it more original than the we're going to break the Guinness Book of World Record thing?

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:20.600
We haven't determined that yet.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.520
Right now it's in exploratory mode.

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:26.240
All I'm going to say is that if you're going to do the Guinness Book of World Record thing,

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.520
that thing's been done like six times now, so please do something to make it more original.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.520
Okay, good.

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:36.760
We're probably doing something completely different, like a big gathering of gamers.

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:41.360
We don't care about the records as long as we raise money.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:44.980
Whatever you decide, sure, put it in writing, send it to us, we'll consider anything.

01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:48.480
We have some of our listeners that run anime conventions that want us to come, and if we

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:54.160
can reasonably make it, sure, especially if the event is in California, we have an easy

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.160
time making it.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:01.080
The whole purpose of this is just to shed the other side of the DDR community, more

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:04.680
the charitable and heartful side of it.

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:05.680
Sounds good to me.

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:08.320
If we can't be there in person, we can at least send some prizes.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:11.520
Well, yeah, whatever you're able to provide us, that'll be cool.

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.520
All right.

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.960
Well, we can't turn this program into a sales pitch, so send me an email and we'll see what

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:15.960
we can do, okay?

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:16.960
All right.

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:17.960
All right.

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:18.960
Zaku, thanks so much for your call.

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:19.960
Have a good one, okay?

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:20.960
Okay.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:21.960
Bye.

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:22.960
Good luck with your event and your cell phone game.

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:23.960
Yes, Logan?

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:27.720
I'd like to make a mention real quick that you were talking about earlier when we were

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.360
discussing the Spike TV video game award winners.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.600
We didn't really leak them because they just put out for us release with all the winners

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.600
now.

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.600
Oh, well, whatever.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:40.160
I mean, every freaking game website had that list anyway.

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.160
It's not like we're telling you anything that revolutionary.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.720
You know what cell phone game they should work on?

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:52.680
It's called Stop Playing With Your Cell Phone and Drive Your Fucking SUV, The Game.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:53.680
I like that idea.

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:54.680
All right.

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.800
Thank you guys so much for all your great calls on Skype tonight.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.640
We are going to close the Skype line at this time.

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:01.880
Of course, if you didn't get three, you can always leave us a voicemail.

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:07.080
Our voicemail of the week, 1-877-GAME-OLR, and leave us your thoughts.

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:10.960
That's available to the many of you that listen to us on the podcast.

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.960
We appreciate that.

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:12.960
All right.

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:17.120
Loki, any last minute stories?

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:18.120
Not really.

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:19.520
Nothing that I really want to mention, I guess.

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.520
I don't know.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.520
Wow.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:27.960
I forgot to mention I played, and it was such an impact on me that I forgot the name of

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:28.960
the game even.

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.320
The new Xbox Live Arcade game, RoboBlitz.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.320
I played that.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.320
It was okay.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.320
I played it for like two seconds.

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.320
I didn't get it.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:37.320
I didn't buy it.

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.320
I didn't buy it either.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.320
I played the demo, yeah.

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:40.320
So, yeah.

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.120
I'll give it another try a little later.

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.960
Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood when I played it.

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:44.960
I guess.

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.960
It was interesting.

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:51.560
You know what they really need to put out on Xbox Live Arcade?

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.560
MDK.

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.560
MDK would be awesome.

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:54.560
That'd be pretty rad.

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:55.560
I would love MDK.

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.560
All right.

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.360
Well, I guess that's it for the show.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:59.360
We're all out of news.

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:02.440
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:07.880
You guys are awesome for coming and listening to us every week, especially when we've been

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:10.840
down for a couple weeks, and unfortunately, it's not going to get any better with Christmas

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:11.840
and New Year's on the horizon.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.560
But we appreciate you guys sticking with us as we move into our, if you can believe it,

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:22.600
as of January 2007, our third year of podcasting, and also in 2007, our fifth year of internet

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:23.600
radio, if you can believe.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.440
Actually, going into our sixth year, because we're going to hit our fifth birthday in 2007,

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.440
if you can believe it.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.920
Crazy stuff, huh?

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.580
Anyway, that's going to do it.

01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:35.520
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.360
Gee, my guess will start with my guess, Loki.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:45.640
My final thought is that popcorn shrimp was delicious.

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:50.200
And my final thought is now everybody's gone to dinner without me, and Dark Sakura's not

01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:51.200
here.

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.320
So we can't go say hi to our favorite waitress at Lion's.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.320
That makes me sad.

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:58.440
Hi, Jeannie, if you're listening, we love you.

01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.440
Thanks again, everybody.

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:00.440
We'll see you next week.

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.280
We will be live again next week with another program.

01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:07.000
I hear it might be the holiday episode, because Dark Sakura was saying something about Chris

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.880
coming back, and Chris wants to do some holiday joy with us, so that should be fun.

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.640
Ho, ho, ho, next week on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:15.640
We'll see you then.

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.640
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
