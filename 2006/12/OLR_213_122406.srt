and the Lowkey

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, December 24th, 2006

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Some new channels make their debut on the Wii

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A California lawmaker targets spyware and games

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And is Katamari about to roll over Xbox Live Arcade?

10

Orange Lounge Radio

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The plague has returned, but not nearly as bad. I'm prepared for it this time around.

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Dark Sakura

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How was your gaming week?

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I did! I did do that!

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Super Pac-Man

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's too damn hard to play

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'd like to mention, just real quick, the story that I'm talking about, which I'll get into a little bit later

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I reported back on October 29th

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Just to give you an idea of how behind the times they are

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He's stewing over there

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I smell an angst bunny

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Alright

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We'll have to do the F-Fuse a little early this week

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, we're probably getting rid of one of our pinballs

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Which one?

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Thinking about possibly the Guns N' Roses trying to get in Indiana Jones

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Are you that mad at Axl Rose for canceling the little Sacramento thing?

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No, I don't care

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Axl Rose is an ass

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't care

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But, um, Dan's been wanting an indie for a while

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And that's pretty cool

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
When are you gonna get Pinbot?

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I want one! Actually, we want Jackbot

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't, you know, your fancy schmancy bootlegs or whatever

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's not a bootleg

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Jackbot is the modern pinball version

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Whatever, whatever

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's got the same tracks as Pinbot

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And has the bonus segment from Bride of Pinbot

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Alright, whatever

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So it's really cool. However, we do have friends who have a Pinbot

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So I can just go over there and play it anytime I want

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But does it do the thing where it goes, I am Pinbot?

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay, good

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It is a fully functional Pinbot

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And that game is fucking hard

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
On the NES it was pretty hard, too

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because on the NES it had the little aliens that would try to eat your ball

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But the actual pinball machine is just difficult

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I see

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But I have a special place in my heart for Pinbot

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Alright

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Anything else you've played this week?

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Besides playing with fire?

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I did play with fire because I lit candles on the winter solstice

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They need to make fire the game

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Well, there's putting out fire the game

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The brave firefighters

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay, alright

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's a year-end award I'd like to see

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Best use of fire in a game

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I did

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, there's also Burning Rangers back in the day

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I played another game though

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What's that?

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I played that marine harpoon Sega game

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Because I was at Walmart and I was bored

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So I played the harpoon game

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And how was that?

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Sucks

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Alright

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You spend the first time you play it and after that it's like

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This screen has burning

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Fix

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
How was my gaming week?

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I played a lot of crappy games, unfortunately

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I played Cars on the Wii and it sucked ass

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I bought it for Nellie

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
She said she could try it and then she agreed it did suck ass

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Then I kind of went back on what I said about Ubisoft

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And I went and bought another Ubisoft game

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And this only further proves that their games suck

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Because I went and bought Monster 4x4 World Circuit

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Despite the reviews, I said

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, they're just probably complaining because the graphics look like GameCube graphics

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And it's not like we've been able to trust any major gaming press review recently anyway

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Exactly

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So, you know, I thought, hey, you know, what the hell

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It sounds like it could be like Excite Truck

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's four players

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That could be fun

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No, it's not

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's a horrible game

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Very awful

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
First off, the graphics suck

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The controls suck

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The game is boring

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The music sucks

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Every aspect about this game blows ass

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And if I rented this game

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I would immediately take it back

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And say, what the hell is this piece of shit that you gave me

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Because this is obviously not a real game

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I've done that with a game before

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But what game?

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It was the WWF at the time, Thunder game

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
On Playstation

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It was so bad that Dan and I took it back to Blockbuster

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And had them trade it out

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I seriously, I would urge anyone not to even consider this as an alternative to Excite Truck

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This is not even close

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I mean

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well most people don't like Excite Truck either

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So they're just like, you know what, no racing on the Wii for me

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Well

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Are you going to pick up Need for Speed Carbon?

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Give it one more shot?

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
No, I'm not picking up Need for Speed Carbon

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Need for Speed Carbon, I know what kind of a game it is

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And so I know it would be pretty decent

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's just not the same type of a game as Excite Truck

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Monster 4x4 World Circuit, it's slow

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But it comes with the Elite Steering Wheel peripheral

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh yeah, the Elite Steering Wheel peripheral

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's a piece of shit

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I brought it into the studio today, okay, you know

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I brought it to have Christopher try it out so he can give a review on the next show

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But it is awful

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It is a really bad game

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And I'm sorry, but they just

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So they had six or seven launch games

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, but they all sucked

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ubisoft, you're just trying to capitalize on the lack of titles

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You know, being out there

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And hoping people will get to buy this stuff

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And you know what, I'm sure a lot of people bought this stuff

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't know, maybe their kids liked it and stuff, but

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's just, it's an awful game

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And once you play, you know, like Excite Truck or something like that

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Or Need for Speed Carbon, you're just like, wow

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What the hell is this shit

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I urge you, do not buy this game

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Because you'll only be disappointed

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you think Ubisoft might be able to redeem themselves

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
With some of the later games that are coming out in 2007?

153
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
With, you know, 360, they've got some pretty big titles planned, right?

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Well, 360, they've got Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Which looks okay, but it looks exactly the same as

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 1

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So, you know, Warfighter 2, great

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I mean, seriously, I

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I challenge you to look at the screenshots and be able to tell the two games apart

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can't

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They look exactly the same, so

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't know

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But then again, people like stuff that's the same, so

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It should be fine

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And Rainbow Six Vegas, I heard, is pretty good

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's not my type of game

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I've seen some of the stuff that they're coming out for the Wii

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
For, you know, say, and

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's not anything new, let me put it that way

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's just ports of old shit

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That they're tacking the controls on

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And they really need to come out and create some new games

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And I'm not talking about Red Steel 2

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm talking about a brand new game

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Does Reggie need to come lay the smackdown?

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I think so

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I think

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I think they're just looking at numbers, you know

180
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And Red Steel sold really well

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's just

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It wasn't that good of a game

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You know, people were looking for another GoldenEye

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And it was not GoldenEye

185
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Alright, was that it?

186
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's it

187
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Alright, My Gaming Week, nothing really new to report for you guys

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I've been playing every extend extra

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
A little bit of Luminous 2 as well

191
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Still playing Burnout on Xbox

192
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And I'm getting very frustrated at how bad I suck at Burnout

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Because, like, you know, the achievements

194
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You, for one of them you have to get, like, all

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Basically, the majority of the achievements are

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You get all perfect ratings

197
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
In every difficulty level

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Right? Well, I'm one star shy

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
In the very first basic difficulty level

200
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There's one freaking race I cannot get a gold medal in

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And therefore I'm not able to get a perfect

202
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And it's frustrating the hell out of me how badly I suck at Burnout

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So, I cry a lot

204
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But it does give me an opportunity to use custom soundtracks

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And, like, listen to, you know

206
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Like, what's kind of funny is usually I'll put in the soundtrack to Wangen

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And Midnight Maximum Tune

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And I'll play Burnout to that

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And it's kind of fun

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So, yay for custom soundtracks

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And, you know, I've been watching extra for play a lot of Excite Truck

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
By the way, I'd like to point out

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He just finally got, just like as of a few moments ago

214
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Got the very last trophy

215
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The Super Duper Rings trophy

216
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And says that nothing else happens

217
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You just get all the trophies, that's it

218
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But he's been using the SD card that Jamie got him for

219
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Christmas to do all the custom soundtracks

220
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
He needs to get all the challenge modes finished

221
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And I think that unlocks one other thing

222
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's minor

223
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He's done every single possible thing he can do in race mode

224
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I mean, I don't know anybody, besides Nelly

225
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's probably as obsessed with this game as X for his

226
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Most people wrote off Excite Truck as kind of cheap

227
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Compared to Xbox 360 racers

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You've been playing it at my house

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I have it at Dan House

230
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Interesting, it's so interesting because

231
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This game kind of got a lot of critical

232
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Heat against it, but

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's really caught on with a lot of folks

234
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That I've shown it to

235
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
They dig that, whereas

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They don't get burnout

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Burnout's too intimidating for them

238
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Whereas me, I kind of prefer burnout, personally

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
To Excite Truck

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I like Excite Truck

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, I like Excite Truck

242
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I think EA should take

243
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Burnout and make Burnout off-road

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And kind of compete with Excite Truck

245
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Because it's kind of got the same

246
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Formula, almost

247
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The way that you score points and stuff

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
For doing drifts

249
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Lack of online support being the biggest

250
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Well, that's just, I know

251
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's lame, that really is lame

252
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Lack of four player racing, stupid

253
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I mean, come on

254
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I really don't understand

255
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Nintendo and just saying, oh you know

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
All these other consoles have been online

257
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
For the last two generations

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
No, we're just not gonna

259
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We just don't feel it right now

260
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No, you're stupid

261
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You're stupid, stupid, stupid

262
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But you can't help but wonder if Excite Truck

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Is doing so well with the casual audience

264
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
How well, I mean

265
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
At least from our perspective, I don't know about you guys

266
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Out there, but all of our friends

267
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Who are only borderline into gaming

268
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Are loving Excite Truck

269
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And I can't help but wonder how Mario Kart's gonna do

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Because you know that's inevitable

271
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That we'll get a Mario Kart on the Wii eventually

272
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Probably not until 2008

273
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I hope it won't suck as bad as Double Dash

274
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Because Double Dash blew ass

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But the DS one was pretty rad

276
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And that's the most recent one, really

277
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Mario Kart 64

278
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's why it rocked

279
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But the thing is though

280
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It better have online play

281
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Because if it doesn't

282
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's a huge mistake

283
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And I think that they really should

284
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Patch Excite Truck

285
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So that it does have online play

286
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Because that's major

287
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Well they're not gonna patch it

288
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's just gonna be a feature in Excite Truck 2

289
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Fine, then it better come out quick

290
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Because I want another game

291
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That if they did something sort of like

292
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You know what Excite Truck reminds me of suddenly?

293
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Is Cruis'n World

294
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Sort of

295
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I guess I can see that a little bit

296
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah, I can see that a little bit

297
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
If they had the multiplayer be

298
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Sort of like how, what was that game?

299
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh god, I can't remember

300
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's 2099

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
One of the racing games

302
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It had the dial-in thing to where you could

303
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You know what Excite Truck reminds me of?

304
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You mean

305
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Rush 2049

306
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes, thank you

307
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You know what Excite Truck reminds me of?

308
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
A woman

309
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
How?

310
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Driving

311
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Woman driver of the game

312
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No, I don't drive like that

313
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes you do

314
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No I don't!

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I drive very well, thank you

316
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You know you reward yourself with stars

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
For the air you get in your vehicle

318
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Whenever you go over

319
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hey, I've been driving since I was 16

320
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And I got my first speeding ticket

321
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So bite my ass in a non-literal way

322
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So bite my ass in a non-literal way

323
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Anyway

324
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Anything else on Excite Truck?

325
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, it was still my gaming week

326
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Eh, who cares

327
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
DS Final Fantasy III

328
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Which I'm loving more and more

329
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Even though it's kind of hard

330
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And I finally got the 4 star difficulty in Elite Beat Agents

331
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
God, I love that game

332
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I really do

333
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Thank you again for the year

334
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll tell you that much

335
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick

336
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Before we get into the news

337
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Next week's show is also going to be pre-taped

338
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We're pre-taped tonight, we're not live as we mentioned previously

339
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But those of you guys on our audio RSS

340
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Also known as podcasting

341
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Have a chance to download the program

342
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And so hello folks

343
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Next week is going to be the same deal

344
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
However, next week is going to be a special show

345
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Since we're anticipating there's not going to be a lot of news

346
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Due to the holiday season

347
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's sort of a year-end special

348
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And we're inviting a lot of our friends

349
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
As in other podcasters

350
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Other shows on OLR

351
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Guests that we've had previously on the program

352
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And people in the industry

353
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We're inviting a whole ton of them to come on

354
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
For little mini interviews

355
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We're going to play a little game

356
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And I'll give you more details next week

357
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We're going to play a little game that will help everybody give an input

358
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
On what the best stuff was in 2006

359
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And what we're going to look forward to in 2007

360
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So by the way

361
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
If you are another podcaster

362
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
An industry type or something

363
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And you want to be on the program next week

364
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Drop me a line ASAP

365
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
rob at orangeoltrader.com

366
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm the one scheduling all that stuff

367
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So we definitely want to have you guys on

368
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Also we want to mention

369
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
dig.com just recently added podcasting

370
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
To their listing

371
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And we want to thank you guys who've dug us

372
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Considering we haven't really mentioned it on the show

373
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Or on the front page of the site

374
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
We did give it a shout out on the forums

375
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
They've been helping out with that effort as well

376
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
We've gotten 60 something digs

377
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
On the podcast, that's pretty cool

378
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So if you feel like going and supporting that a little more

379
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That would be awesome because it all helps to spread the word

380
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Which as you know

381
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Independent radio has to rely on

382
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
To get the news out there

383
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Because we don't have no magazine that gives us free

384
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Two, three page spreads in to promote our product

385
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So you have to go on there

386
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And vote

387
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And isn't it interesting

388
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That even that being said

389
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Because they're so out there

390
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And so pushed

391
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
They end up getting dug the most too

392
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Well they do have employees that can go and dig

393
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I suppose that's true too

394
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Anywho, let's get into some gaming news

395
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Starting with Loki

396
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And of course this week

397
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
We had two updates to it

398
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The forecast channel

399
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And the internet channel being added

400
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The forecast channel is, well, weather

401
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And it was pretty simplistic

402
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But fun to play around with

403
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I think we all spun the globe a lot

404
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Because I was bored

405
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I think we all spun the globe

406
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's what you do with globes

407
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
When I was in school and I'd find a globe

408
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'd spin it

409
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
We would try to find the funniest city name

410
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Is what we used to do with the globe

411
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I would take stickers

412
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And paste them all over the globe

413
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I was very disappointed though

414
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No five day forecast for Antarctica

415
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
How am I supposed to know what the weather is going to be like

416
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
For the rest of the week

417
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The forecast for Antarctica

418
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
COLD MOTHERFUCKER

419
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Watch out for penguins

420
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Anyways

421
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So those have been the launch

422
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The of course internet channel is free

423
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Until June 2007

424
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Or June 30, 2007

425
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Which it'll be pay afterwards

426
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Five bucks afterwards

427
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Right now I guess they're considering it a beta

428
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Why is it not done

429
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Damn you Opera

430
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I mean come on, finish the fucking thing

431
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Whatever

432
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So they're working the kinks out

433
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It'll be updated I'm assuming for free

434
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Everyone's assuming, oh we're all going to have to pay for it

435
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
In July or whatever

436
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't think so

437
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I think they're just going to update it

438
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And so look forward to that

439
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And then of course I think in January

440
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
We're going to be getting the news channel

441
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Which hopefully will have a way to sign up for different RSS feeds and stuff

442
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Because I don't really give a shit about the world news

443
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Whatever

444
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah they're really trying to turn the Wii into the front page of Yahoo

445
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Well what do you think though about the browser channel

446
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I think it's pretty good

447
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm glad it does support Flash

448
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Because you'll see a lot more from OLR Wii.com

449
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I've got some good plans for that

450
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Hurry hurry

451
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And what's good though is it's definitely a lot easier to browse than say the PSP browser

452
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's for sure

453
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't know how long it will be before we actually

454
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's actually kind of weird

455
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's a little bit easier to browse than the PS3 browser too

456
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Because apparently their text entry sucks too

457
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But I'm wondering how long it will be before we see a 360 browser

458
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Because they got to jump on the bandwagon

459
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't know

460
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's pretty cool

461
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I know that the Wiicade stuff doesn't work too well

462
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Everyone was hoping that site would be good

463
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But they have to downgrade all their games for Flash 7

464
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It was okay

465
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
They're pretty fun

466
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That's pretty much all I have

467
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's a good start

468
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Did you check out any YouTube

469
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Because I went to YouTube

470
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Not bad

471
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's pretty cool that YouTube will work on the Wii browser

472
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The only problem is that you've got that navigation bar

473
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That does not go away

474
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That sits there on the bottom fifth of the screen

475
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So when you make YouTube full screen

476
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Your video is still only in a tiny little box

477
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Well it's not a tiny box

478
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But when you're looking at a big widescreen TV

479
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It doesn't take up a big portion of it

480
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So I kind of wish there was a way to make that stuff bigger

481
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Because YouTube is a pretty awesome site

482
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
To be looking at on the Wii

483
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You can get everybody in the living room

484
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And what I did is I created my own personal page

485
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Finally on YouTube

486
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And I started bookmarking videos I really like

487
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Like the banana muffin

488
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That our listeners are going to have no idea what I'm talking about

489
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But you can bookmark these videos

490
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And play them for people

491
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So that's cool

492
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I like the Wii browser as well

493
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm looking forward to whatever you are able to come up with

494
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
For OLRWII.com

495
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Because OLRPSP.com

496
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That site is still getting

497
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Even though we haven't really done a lot of maintenance

498
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's still getting talked about

499
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And it looks great on the PSP

500
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You did a really good job with that

501
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So hats off to you

502
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Looking forward to seeing what you can do with the Wii

503
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Really?

504
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I can't help it

505
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes we're looking forward to seeing what Matt can do with his Wii

506
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Let me talk

507
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Also about some other Wii news

508
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
A lot of folks are talking about Virtual Console

509
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And I thought it was quite humorous

510
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That people thought Nintendo was going to throw them

511
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
A free game at Christmas

512
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Well I don't know

513
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I heard rumors that Sony is doing something similar

514
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But I guess

515
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Folks thought Nintendo was going to throw them

516
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Super Mario Brothers, one of their biggest games

517
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
As a free game

518
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Considering how many times we've had to buy

519
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Super Mario Brothers

520
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Like the Game Boy one they had

521
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And the Super Nintendo one they had

522
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And all that crap

523
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You'd think they could give us it for free

524
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But no, it's coming out for 500 Wii points

525
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
On Christmas Day

526
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But also coming out, ToeJam and Earl

527
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
R-Type for the TurboGrafx-16

528
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And

529
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Super Castlevania

530
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Which should be pretty awesome

531
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Street Fighter 2 as well

532
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Even though I don't really plan on checking that one out

533
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah you like R-Type?

534
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Urban Champion

535
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I think it was Baseball

536
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
By the way, Urban Champion kind of sucks

537
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Like

538
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I know a lot of people think it might be cool

539
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Because they haven't really heard of it

540
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But keep in mind this game was made like

541
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Before Double Dragon

542
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Before a lot of that other stuff

543
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Urban Champion kind of sucks

544
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's not going to be worth the 500 points I'm sorry to say

545
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
We need Bad Dudes

546
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
New Year's Day is kind of weak

547
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But Christmas Day is very strong in releases

548
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Are you a bad enough dude to save the president?

549
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
No it sucked on the NES

550
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It totally sucked

551
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Compared to the arcade

552
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Did they make Bad Dudes on Genesis?

553
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I can't remember

554
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I thought they made it on another system besides just the Nintendo

555
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh well

556
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So you have those releases

557
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
To look forward to on Christmas

558
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Well speaking of releases

559
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well

560
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There are some

561
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Next week in the UK

562
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And by some I mean three

563
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Of course on the 25th we have Wii Sports

564
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Duh

565
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
On the 29th we've got

566
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What the hell retailer is going to be open on the 25th in the UK

567
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
To sell Wii Sports

568
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Or whatever whatever

569
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm like yeah

570
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And then also two PSP releases

571
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Free Running

572
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And Lego Star Wars 2

573
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The original trilogy

574
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
On the 29th

575
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Makes sense though that it's a slow week in the UK

576
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's going to be pretty slow over here too

577
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Right Loki?

578
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yeah it's extremely slow

579
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I want to say there's actually nothing coming out

580
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm pretty confident in that

581
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And if anything it was just

582
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
A crappy ass DS game

583
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And I really mean crappy like

584
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Board game collection type crappy

585
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Anyway so but we do have some

586
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Exclusive release dates for you

587
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And I'd like to touch on something I was talking about earlier

588
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
In the show about how websites are carrying

589
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Exclusive stories that certain games

590
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Are coming out and that they have the first

591
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
News on it

592
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
There's actually a news art

593
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
News piece that's being run by GoNintendo.com

594
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Which is actually originally covered on

595
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Codenamerevolution.com

596
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Talking about High School Musical being in

597
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Development for the Wii

598
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
In case you forgot we did mention

599
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That back in episode 206

600
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Way back in the month of

601
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
October and

602
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Gave you a release date of that as well

603
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And in case you

604
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Haven't heard of that I believe it's

605
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Coming out in May

606
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But who cares it's High School Musical the game

607
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I put this right up there with like happy feet

608
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Exactly it's a

609
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's a crappy game

610
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Can't you guys just kiss and make up it's really not worth fighting over

611
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
No it's worth fighting over

612
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Everything is worth fighting

613
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
No but seriously so

614
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That's coming out and you know

615
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Great we did have a few other things

616
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And these were actually some of these were mentioned

617
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
During the week you know I had them posted in our show

618
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
World but you know during the week more news

619
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Came out and we had you know some dates

620
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Being released of course like Prince of Persia

621
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Rival Swords for the Wii

622
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Being announced by Ubisoft and

623
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That's coming out March 14th

624
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
What they didn't mention

625
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Though is that Driver

626
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Parallel Lines will also be coming out on

627
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The Wii and the PSP

628
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
That is also the same day on March

629
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
14th and a week

630
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Prior they're going to be releasing their

631
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Game for the new Ninja Turtles

632
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Movie and that's coming out on

633
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Playstation 2, GameCube, 360

634
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The Wii, the DS and the Game Boy Advance

635
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And that's coming out

636
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
On the 7th

637
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Also from Ubisoft we've got

638
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
A sequel to their really crappy Game Boy

639
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Advance game Dogs, Dogs 2

640
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Which is coming out on the

641
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
7th of March as well

642
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
They have a music game coming out at the end of

643
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
February called Guitar Hit

644
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
For the PSP, no word on what that is

645
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But it's probably some music and rhythm game

646
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Probably is ripping off on

647
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I've never seen a guitar rhythm game before

648
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
This is a completely new concept for me

649
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's on the PSP

650
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So I'm not sure how well that's going to work

651
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That's coming out on

652
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
February 28th

653
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Splinter Cell Double Agent finally making its way

654
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
To the Playstation 3 as they announced earlier this week

655
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That's going to be March 14th

656
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Atari has

657
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Two Dragon Ball Z games coming out

658
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Dragon Ball Z Shin Budokai and other

659
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
For PSP

660
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And other Shin Budokai games

661
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And that's coming out March 14th

662
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And then Dragon Ball Z

663
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Haru Kannaru

664
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's a very long name

665
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Haru Kannaru

666
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Densetsu

667
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Legendary

668
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
For the DS

669
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And that's a mouthful right there

670
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That's coming out on the 21st of March

671
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And then

672
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You're going to love this

673
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Elder Scrolls Oblivion for the Playstation 3

674
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Delayed yet again

675
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
To the end of February

676
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Coming out now February 27th

677
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What the hell

678
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
G, where have I heard this Oblivion getting delayed

679
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
For the new console thing before

680
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Where have I heard this before?

681
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
2006 maybe?

682
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah, seriously

683
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So it's being delayed yet again

684
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't know why they don't have it done yet

685
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But whatever

686
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Alright

687
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Well thanks for the exclusive look at some of the US news

688
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And so nobody else has mentioned that whole Oblivion

689
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Getting delayed thing, huh?

690
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
No, no, but I'm sure a few months

691
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
From now they'll mention, oh by the way it's been

692
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Delayed, we have the exclusive news on it

693
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Because everyone seems to ignore

694
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Us

695
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We're not a real legitimate site

696
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Because we love game in our title

697
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Coming out in Japan

698
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Also kind of slim pickins in Japan

699
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
This week, but you do get the Japanese

700
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Version of Prey on the 360

701
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
This week on December 28th

702
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Also on the Playstation 3

703
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You're going to get Formula 1 Championship

704
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Edition coming out there

705
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Coming to the Nintendo Wii

706
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You get, not a lot, you get a new memory

707
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Card there

708
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Coming to the Playstation 2 you get Formula 1

709
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
2006

710
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yunimishi and Himihibi

711
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Princess Days

712
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Does that sound like a title you're interested in playing?

713
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Sounds kind of cute

714
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Coming for the Nintendo DS

715
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
We have just a bunch of accessories

716
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Some pens, some covers

717
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And an Animal Crossing mascot

718
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Strap and a carrying bag

719
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
For Animal Crossing

720
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Sounds like it might be kind of fun

721
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You do get Dragon Quest Monsters though on the DS

722
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Dragon Quest games are always

723
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Pretty big deals over there in Japan

724
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Even though it's a spin-off game still

725
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Going to be pretty big

726
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And that's really all I have

727
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Not a whole lot, it's a slow week over there too

728
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And as I was going to say, the High School Musical game

729
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I said May, because I was just completely pulling it out

730
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Of my head, but I looked back in the showroom for

731
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Episode 206

732
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And apparently it was July 11th

733
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
May was Pirates of the Caribbean 3

734
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Let it go, Jesus

735
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Okay, I gotta get my information correct

736
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Okay, just in case

737
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Fair enough, fair enough

738
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Anyways

739
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Now that we're moving on from our angst aren't we?

740
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I think so, yeah

741
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Well there is talk of

742
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
DS and Wii

743
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
connectivity coming around

744
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
They're basically comparing it

745
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
To how it was with

746
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
The GameCube and Game Boy Advance

747
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But they're saying that they're hoping that it's

748
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Going to be a lot better

749
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Whereas with the Xbox 360

750
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Connects to your PC for

751
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Streaming video and media

752
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
They're talking about more improving gameplay

753
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And offering new experiences

754
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
The best news about this is that I won't have to

755
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Buy some fucking cable to do it

756
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Like you had to do on the GameCube, remember?

757
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
To connect to your Advance or whatever

758
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But then it didn't work with the Advance SP

759
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Nope, it didn't

760
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It was so annoying, so annoying

761
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Damn you Nintendo, I'm still mad at you over that

762
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That's why I still held onto my GBA

763
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Because I have to tell you what I want to see

764
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Come out again

765
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Is the Pac-Man Plus

766
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Or Pac-Man Versus

767
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Oh, Pac-Man Versus, yeah that would actually be a really

768
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Fun download title for the Wii, wouldn't it?

769
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I actually

770
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
We still randomly play

771
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
That game because it's so much

772
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Fantastic, I mean it was such a fun idea

773
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Well also I think about, you know, they should really give

774
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Four Swords another chance, because I think a lot of

775
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
People didn't get into Four Swords on the GameCube

776
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Because of the fact you had to have all these people

777
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Had to have an Advance and all these people had to have the

778
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Cables, and it wasn't usually hard to find people

779
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
With an Advance, but it was hard to find people with the

780
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Cables to play the game with

781
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Same thing with Crystal Chronicles

782
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I think we actually had to have two or three sets of cables

783
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
At my house just because of that

784
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah, but you're, you know, you're a nerd

785
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Well I mean, it was just that we ended up

786
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Dan worked at Gamestop at the time

787
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Found him cheap, we'd just hold on to him

788
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
But it was really

789
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I think in that respect though

790
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It's, hey we make it require this

791
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We can sell more stuff

792
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So, I don't know

793
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm really, really hoping that we get

794
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Not just

795
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You know, like the one or two ones

796
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
That were out before, but get a whole series

797
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Of games that interact

798
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Between the Wii and the DS

799
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I could really go for that

800
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Is this how they could do that, Loki?

801
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
How they could get more games to interact

802
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
With both systems

803
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Well, probably just

804
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
They'll probably start adding it on

805
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Kind of like they did with the Game Boy Advance

806
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Stuff, you know, where like, remember Metroid Prime

807
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Where you could download the original Metroid

808
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
To it and stuff like that

809
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
They'll probably start with gimmicky

810
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Stuff like that, hopefully maybe the new

811
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Animal Crossing will allow you to download some games

812
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Dream on!

813
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Actually, I have an idea

814
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
They should do

815
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Be able to turn your Wii into a demo station

816
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah, that's been a long time

817
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Rumor, yeah, I remember

818
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Nobody's ever seen if that's really going to happen

819
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
But yeah, the rumor was you'd be able to download

820
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
DS demos through your Wii

821
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Just like you're supposed to be able to do PSP demos through the PS3

822
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But if an Animal Crossing were to come out on Wii

823
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That means that we'd probably get the island

824
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Back, that should be fun

825
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I think everybody's waiting for Animal Crossing

826
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
On the Wii, I don't know, I'm a little skeptical this time

827
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Because I was so excited about Animal Crossing

828
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
On the DS

829
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I was so excited about it and then played it for like two weeks

830
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And then I was done

831
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I think you should have a Mii game

832
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You know, you make your Wii on your

833
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Your Mii on your Wii and download your Mii

834
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
To the DS with a little thing as like sub games

835
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I guess anything is possible

836
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Anything's possible

837
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I don't know

838
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
But one thing that they're probably not going to have

839
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
In Animal Crossing is the

840
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Wiimote throwing game

841
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Because they've been getting a lot of heat

842
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
On the whole Wiimote strap thing

843
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
In fact, of course, as I predicted last week

844
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Immediately the next day

845
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Class action lawsuit

846
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Filed for the stupid Wii strap things

847
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And of course

848
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
He's so humble, isn't he?

849
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Hey, I mean, I'm not taking credit for that

850
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Because anybody could have guessed that

851
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
That's just stupid

852
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I mean, of course it was coming

853
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Because people were looking to profit from all this stuff

854
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So, some company, Greenwelling LLP

855
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Filed a national

856
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Class action lawsuit

857
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
On behalf of the owners

858
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Of Nintendo Wii, thank you them

859
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Because, you know, all these

860
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Wii owners are in dire need

861
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Of some money

862
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
No, you know what? You don't represent me

863
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I am a Nintendo Wii owner since launch day

864
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And you don't represent me

865
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Let that be known on this program

866
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Anyway, you need to say

867
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I represent Wii owners except

868
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Rob from Orange Lawns Radio

869
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And me

870
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You should just say you represent stupid people

871
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
They said that basically

872
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
The class action lawsuit

873
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Rose as a result of the defective nature

874
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Of the Wii remotes

875
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Basically saying that the wrist straps

876
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Were not, you know

877
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Strong enough to withstand

878
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
The use of the player

879
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And that Nintendo

880
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Did not include enough

881
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Instruction on how to use

882
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
The Wii remote properly

883
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
What? Oh my god

884
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
That's a Wii remote up their butt

885
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That's a retard, I'm sorry

886
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
No, no, that's insulting to retarded people

887
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
That's just an idiot

888
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm sorry, I can't deal with that

889
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And that it's basically

890
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
You know

891
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
What they're saying though

892
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And they're looking to do is

893
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
The class action lawsuit is going to

894
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Basically correct

895
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
They want to correct the defect in the Wii remote

896
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And provide a refund to the purchase

897
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Or replace the defective Wii remotes

898
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And

899
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You know

900
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I think they're trying to also claim damages

901
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
For stuff that people have done

902
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I can't help but think though

903
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That they've sent out emails

904
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
There's a stupid indicator in the front of

905
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
All the games

906
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It's built into the games for god's sake

907
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Built into the consoles on every single game

908
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Says the Wii strap thing

909
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
They've offered this free replacement program

910
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
If you want to replace your Wii straps

911
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
They'll do it for free

912
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I told you in the instruction mails

913
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Do not swing wildly

914
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And you don't need to swing wildly

915
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And the commercials don't show them swinging wildly

916
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Granted they show them diving across the couch

917
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
But that's not swinging wildly

918
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That's just acting like an idiot

919
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Well I think the best comparison

920
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I heard about that though

921
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Is that like you know in a commercial

922
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
For a new car

923
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
They show them driving in the wilderness

924
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Doing all these stunts

925
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And they always have that little thing

926
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You know that you don't do that with a regular car

927
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You just know that

928
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Common sense tells you that

929
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Common sense tells you

930
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
If you dive across the couch

931
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You're likely to break the couch or a lamp

932
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Or your wiimote

933
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But that's the risk you take

934
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It had warnings

935
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
They made the warnings abundant

936
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Three words

937
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Idiot

938
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Well this comes down to Nintendo

939
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Of course this is without merit

940
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
We're going to see what we just said

941
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
About the Wii

942
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
That they've given way more than enough

943
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Precautions and stuff

944
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And people are stupid

945
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It's just like you know

946
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
You don't see lawsuits out there for people

947
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Throwing baseball bats and hitting somebody with them

948
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And them suing the baseball bat company

949
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Because they're stupid and let go of the bat

950
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
They know they're not supposed to do that

951
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Well just like you know you're not supposed to swing

952
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
The remote like a 90 mile an hour fastball

953
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And just because your hands became slippery

954
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Well you know if I had a knife

955
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And my hands were slippery and I accidentally

956
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Stabbed someone with the knife

957
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's my old damn fault not the knife company

958
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Because they made their knives sharp

959
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's just

960
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's really dumb and I hope to god

961
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That they have somebody out there

962
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
That sees this case and throws it out of court

963
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
You know but

964
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Did they say this might go to jury trial

965
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Or that's what they want? Is they want a jury trial out of this?

966
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Well they were

967
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I think the lawsuit was

968
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
On the Xbox 360 where they were seeking

969
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Five million dollars for

970
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
They haven't really said a number

971
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That they're looking to get yet

972
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But I mean from what we've seen so far

973
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
The Wii straps breaking has been

974
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Relatively rare

975
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I mean it's happened

976
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But you know people post it on the internet

977
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And so it seems like a bigger problem than it actually is

978
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And a lot of these

979
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
We found out as of last week

980
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That are faked

981
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So I mean

982
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I just see this as just them trying to prop it up

983
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Let's take the fakers to court

984
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Nintendo ought to sue all the fakers

985
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That would be funny

986
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Well that does make sense

987
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Technically it's perjury

988
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
There you go

989
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I say if Nintendo loses money on this

990
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
They take those fakers to court

991
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
That would be funny

992
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Defamation

993
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Defamation suit

994
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I think that would be funny

995
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Now real quickly I want to say though

996
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Did you hear about like that trillion dollar lawsuit

997
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
That the RIAA

998
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Filed against that Russian MP3

999
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Company that was selling all of

1000
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
MP3.com or whatever that site is

1001
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Did you hear about that?

1002
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
It's like one of the biggest lawsuits ever

1003
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Trillions of dollars

1004
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Like 1.6 trillion dollar lawsuit or something like that

1005
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
There was another study I read

1006
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I don't even remember exactly what it was

1007
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But it was something that they were saying

1008
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
That these claims, the damages that are being caused

1009
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
By the downloads are a lot

1010
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That these companies are seeking for

1011
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And that

1012
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Really the

1013
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
People downloading these MP3's are not really

1014
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Causing that much damage to them

1015
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
All this news about lawsuits

1016
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I don't know about you guys but news about stupid

1017
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Lawsuits makes me very angry

1018
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Does it make you angry?

1019
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Everything makes me angry

1020
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You know what happens when we get angry?

1021
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Music

1022
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The F you's of the week time

1023
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
DarkSakura what's pissing you off this week

1024
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
F you to mucus

1025
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And the extreme amounts of it that live in my lungs

1026
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And make me sick every morning

1027
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I hate bronchitis

1028
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I hate it

1029
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I hate it

1030
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I hate it

1031
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Remember Kefka? Oh, forget it.

1032
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Yes. Yes, I remember.

1033
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But, um, I'd also like to just offer an F.U. to a tower video for not having any Dr. Who DVDs before they, uh, went on business.

1034
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Loki?

1035
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I'm pissed off at the lack of Wii games that are out there that- good Wii games.

1036
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Because, you know, I'm really s- I'm kinda searching for some more stuff to play, and I bought a lot of stuff, and I have to say about, you know, 60% of it's been crap.

1037
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And it's just- it's not because, you know, I picked a crappy game, it's just-

1038
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Haven't you played damn near every launch title now, except, like, Happy Feet and Avatar?

1039
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Well, I haven't played, like, any of the, you know, Happy Feet, Avatar, SpongeBob, you know, that stuff that's ports off of old games like Ant Bully and stuff.

1040
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But I've played, you know, quite a bit of everything, and it's- a lot of it's really crappy, and I'm-

1041
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I'm starting to get a little afraid that, you know, maybe this launch for the Wii wasn't as good as everyone's saying it was, because a lot of the games are really shitty, whereas, you know, even like the 360 launch, a lot of the games, you know, I didn't like, like Perfect Dark Zero was pretty shitty, I thought, but it was a lot better than this stuff.

1042
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But, I mean, look, to be fair, the games that were good on Wii were really good, like, you know, Zelda, and I thought Excite Truck was pretty damn good, especially for a launch title.

1043
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Trauma Center, fucking amazing, especially if you haven't played the DS one.

1044
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Here's the thing it's coming down to, is because Excite Truck is really good, it's like, yeah, that's awesome, I want to find another game like this.

1045
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Oh wait, there isn't anything like this, and next month there's only going to be one game.

1046
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Elibits wasn't bad.

1047
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Oh, I like Elibits.

1048
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
WarioWare's going to be pretty good.

1049
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:56,000
WarioWare's going to be really fun, but afterwards, what was there coming out afterwards, in February we've got like two games coming out, it's a big drought, despite what Reggie may say, there will be no drought in games or whatever, there is a drought in games, and it's like three games coming out in the next two months.

1050
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm sorry, they need more than this.

1051
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Don't you expect that there's going to be a drought in January, February, for every system?

1052
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
What do the other systems have coming?

1053
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The other systems, 360's got Lost Planet, which is a pretty large title, well, Battle Stations Midway, which is shit, and Fusion Frenzy, and then Playstation 3 doesn't have shit coming out for it, but Playstation 3 doesn't have shit coming out for it at launch either.

1054
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And then Playstation 2, I mean, January, granted, is a slow month, but February does have a lot of stuff coming out for other systems, a lot of big titles, and the Wii's just kind of being skipped.

1055
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Alright.

1056
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:58,000
My FUs of the week, I don't really have a lot, so FU2 cookies for being so tempting and straying me from my diet this holiday season, because I've gotten so many yummy cookies, like, you know, Loki and Nellie made me some for Christmas that were very good, no offense, I mean, the cookies were great, it's just too tempting, and then some of my students at work made me cookies, and, oh gosh, it's too much, too much to handle.

1057
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Let's get back into some news, and it's funny that you brought this up, but, you know, it was talked about this week, the whole delays for Wii games, there was some news going on that Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime could possibly be delayed all the way to Christmas,

1058
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:31,000
but then, of course, Reggie Fils-Aime discussed with Newsweek, not that long ago, he made a promise Nintendo would not have the launch problems they have with usual consoles, quote, Metroid Prime 3, which is a from-the-ground-up creation of Metroid for the Wii system, will come out in early 2007.

1059
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:46,000
This gives us fantastic momentum coming off the launch, and will certainly be an example of how there will be no new game drought for this system. Another from-the-ground-up Wii game that we are strategically timing to launch to make sure we are continuing driving momentum through 2007 is Super Mario Galaxy.

1060
00:41:46,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You know, and they really are doing a good job keeping games coming out, Nintendo is, you know, because they've got WarioWare for January, Wii Play for February, Mario Party 8 for March, I mean, and that's already, you know, the first quarter of the year, and they've got a game coming out every month.

1061
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Can't say the same for other companies, though, because...

1062
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So it's the third parties that have to pick it up, but is it still kind of new, maybe?

1063
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Maybe, well, and third parties have their development cycles, you know, March you're going to see a ton of games come out.

1064
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And remember how Nintendo wasn't letting a lot of them online at first?

1065
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
That's stupid.

1066
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
That could be part of it, too.

1067
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Nintendo needs to fucking get a clue, online's where it is now, and you know what, people were really excited about the online for the DS, and I thought, okay, because they saw that, let's take that as an example as, get this fucking console online.

1068
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
This Mii Channel, you know, exchanging Miis and exchanging messages shit is, it's old.

1069
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It's old already, and we need, you know, some more online games.

1070
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It needs some actual good support for the online.

1071
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I also want to mention that it was previously said by Reggie as well that virtual console games may pick up the slack a little bit between the big, big support of the first parties,

1072
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:11,000
that that's when they'll release some of the big stuff people want on virtual console, such as, I'm sure, Kid Icarus, Metroid at some point, you know, Super Mario World on Super Nintendo.

1073
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Those types of games will be strategically planned for when there's a drought of big Wii games.

1074
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Great, you know what you need to do with those virtual console games?

1075
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
You need to put them online, like they do with Xbox Live Arcade games.

1076
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Put them so that you can play multiplayer online.

1077
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Maybe not exactly as how they're doing it because the Xbox Live Arcade games have had a little bit of problems with some of the online components of them,

1078
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
but multiplayer online with Mario Kart, I mean, that's going to be awesome.

1079
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Of course, they probably wouldn't want to compete with their new Mario Kart whenever the fuck that's coming out, but...

1080
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Evie, you could really add a lot of oomph to some of these old crap titles, like baseball, tennis, Mario Brothers.

1081
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Well, I shouldn't say it's crap.

1082
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I mean, they all contributed to history, but now...

1083
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
League of Pores at least.

1084
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yeah, you could really add a lot of oomph to these games and really justify the $5 price with these little enhancements, I think.

1085
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It's not asking that much, I mean, I don't know.

1086
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Well, you know, I'm sure there's a huge technical aspect when it comes to lag and all that stuff, but, you know, whatever.

1087
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Well, excuse me for a moment while my voice fills me.

1088
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,000
There are a few rumors floating about, and one that I know a lot of people would really, really like to see.

1089
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:33,000
There are talks actually from EGM on the January issue stating that Katamari Damacy would be coming out on the Wii and Xbox Live Arcade.

1090
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm sort of not sure how it would work, you know, on the Wii, if you'd do it like Monkey Ball.

1091
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Probably like Monkey Ball.

1092
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Yeah, but Xbox Live, though, it would definitely, it's a good idea, I think, for Xbox Live.

1093
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I'm worried about the size limitation on Xbox Live, though, with 50 megs.

1094
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Well, I guess the graphics ain't all that.

1095
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
What's that?

1096
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I don't know, okay.

1097
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I loaded my copy onto my HD loader, and it wasn't that big.

1098
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I'd have to check it again, but it wasn't.

1099
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Well, I'm hearing the rumors that they're going to up the live limit because the new memory card's coming out, the 256 megs.

1100
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I think the 50 meg limit's stupid anyways, and to be honest, so you can't download a live arcade game to your memory card.

1101
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Boo-fucking-who?

1102
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Who cares? Get a goddamn hard drive.

1103
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Or don't use that part of it.

1104
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Just use your fucking memory card for saves, and that is it.

1105
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
We don't even do that. We just use a hard drive.

1106
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Yeah, the only thing I use memory cards for, downloading content from kiosks, and I don't even do that anymore.

1107
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Didn't we heart Katamari have a two-player mode?

1108
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It did, didn't it?

1109
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah, so could you imagine having that on Xbox?

1110
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Well, the original one did too.

1111
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
The original one did too.

1112
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
That's right.

1113
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It was kind of a... I like co-op mode better for Katamari.

1114
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It wasn't like, you know, it's no Halo, Gears of War-style multiplayer that keeps people coming back, but it's a nice addition.

1115
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
You know, makes it a little something special.

1116
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
That would be kind of fun on Xbox Live.

1117
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I would love to see, you know...

1118
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I'd much rather play Katamari Damacy co-op than Gears of War, I'm sorry.

1119
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'd love to see the Wii version have your Miis as, like, the little, you know, characters running around in the levels and stuff.

1120
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
That'd be funny.

1121
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Oh, getting to roll over your friends?

1122
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah.

1123
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
That'd be fun.

1124
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Dude, that would be really cool.

1125
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Or they should do, like, as a...

1126
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Are the massive people in your Mii parade?

1127
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Yeah.

1128
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Or they should do, like, a convert a Mii, an existing Mii into a little prince cousin.

1129
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Little prince face? Maybe.

1130
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
That'd be fun.

1131
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I think that would be good. They have a lot of things that they can do with that, and hopefully they'll actually use all that.

1132
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And of course, Loki will be all about the achievements.

1133
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Fuck that shit.

1134
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yes, it will be all about the achievements.

1135
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
No, but anyways.

1136
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Speaking of the 360, the 360 owner's got a pretty cool surprise recently, as Microsoft has upped their warranty from 90 days to one whole year.

1137
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So if your console happens to be broken, or if it was broken, you're going to be getting a refund for your broken console.

1138
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So that is pretty awesome.

1139
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And definitely, you know, at least they're supporting their hardware with the issues that they may have for it.

1140
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So, go Microsoft.

1141
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Hooray for them.

1142
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Alright, hooray for this, too, because obviously I'm a big fan of Luminous, as you guys know.

1143
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And there's a song in Luminous 2 that is just awesome, and it's a song called Heavenly Star.

1144
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Let me play a little bit of a clip of this song.

1145
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Well, this song, of course, is in Luminous 2 on the PSP, and it was just released for download on iTunes this week.

1146
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
So you can check that out by the Genki Rockets, a song that's called Heavenly Star.

1147
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Well, this song, of course, since Mizuguchi had a part to do with this song, I believe he co-wrote it, it's going to be also making its way to Xbox Live Arcade.

1148
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's going to be in the Heavenly Star pack that's supposed to come out in January 2007.

1149
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Now, we were also supposed to be getting the Artist pack in January of 2007, so we'll see what happens with that.

1150
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Now, Q Entertainment hasn't said what the price for the Heavenly Star pack is going to be,

1151
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:16,000
but I would think that, you know, I would think that it would only cost, like, a dollar or something cheap.

1152
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
If it's just the one skin, I don't know if they're going to do remixes or what,

1153
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
but I would think it would be a nice thing to give away for free if it's just going to be one skin, right?

1154
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And it's such a great song.

1155
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I hear it's going to be about a buck to download.

1156
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
That's not bad.

1157
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I guess that's not bad, considering that's what the song costs to download, and it is a great song, and it's fun to play, too.

1158
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So, we'll see what happens with that.

1159
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I really like this song, ever since the video was posted back in the day.

1160
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Yeah, it's a good song.

1161
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It's fun to play Luminous 2, but, you know, again, you don't want to rely on one song to push your game,

1162
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
so, you know, I would hope that they supplement this with some other, you know, artist skins that come out.

1163
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Because, surprisingly, some of those songs in Luminous 2 weren't bad to play to, and even, I have to admit,

1164
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
even, like, Hall of Batgirl is kind of funny.

1165
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I mean, just to have that playing in Luminous, I know we all hate Gwen Stefani, but, you know, it's kind of fun.

1166
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
And, you know, the Black Eyed Peas pump it song, and Missy Elliott lose control.

1167
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
That's a great one to play Luminous 2.

1168
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I'm sorry.

1169
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
They got some fun.

1170
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
They had some pretty fun choices.

1171
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
For the benefit of our listeners, I'm staring blankly at Rob.

1172
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Whatever.

1173
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Then go to the next story.

1174
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Because I don't listen to any of that.

1175
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Go to the next story.

1176
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Well, you know how we were saying that Metal Gear, not just we, I mean, a bunch of people were saying

1177
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 was going to be multi-platform?

1178
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It was a rumor last week.

1179
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Yeah, it was a rumor.

1180
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Well, an inside source at Konami is not really that reliable.

1181
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It's been, they've come out saying that it's going to be definitely exclusive for PS3.

1182
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
At this time is the key word, or words, I should say.

1183
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
So they let themselves in and out?

1184
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
It's at this time.

1185
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It's just like they said, you know, what was it?

1186
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Well, one I pointed out when they brought their version of the story that Splinter Cell was coming out on the PS3 as well.

1187
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And they said, oh, we had no plans of this coming out on the PlayStation 3 at this time.

1188
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And then next week they announced, oh, it's coming out on the PlayStation 3.

1189
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Oh, no, it wasn't that.

1190
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It was Virtual Fighter V.

1191
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
That's what it was.

1192
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
They were doing an interview for that, and that was a PlayStation 3 exclusive.

1193
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And then this week, you know, 360.

1194
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I'm going to say something uncharacteristic for me.

1195
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I don't really think any other system can do the game justice but PS3.

1196
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Interesting. What makes you say that?

1197
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Playing Resistance Fall of Man.

1198
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
You don't think they could do it on 360? What is it?

1199
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
They could do it, but it would not do it justice.

1200
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:49,000
With everything that I've seen that they want to do with Metal Gear Solid 4, they're going to need the extra processing power.

1201
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
They're really going to need it.

1202
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Because I've played a bunch of stuff on Xbox 360, and it all comes out really pretty.

1203
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:04,000
But I honestly, just doing comparisons for several of the games, I think the PS3 is going to be the better platform for the game anyway.

1204
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I guarantee you this will be out on the 360.

1205
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Not day and date, but it will be out on the 360.

1206
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I'm going to have it on PS3. It doesn't matter.

1207
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Interesting.

1208
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I never really got into Metal Gear past the old NES ones.

1209
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I don't know. I somehow missed that boat, and I know I'm weird for missing it.

1210
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Rob, do you believe that love can bloom on a battlefield?

1211
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Shut up.

1212
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
They basically, it's all about money. That's what it is.

1213
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,000
If the PlayStation 3 has 200,000 units out there, or say, okay, by the end of...

1214
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
What if the PS3 suddenly takes off between this and Final Fantasy 13?

1215
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
That's exactly it. If the PlayStation 3 takes off between now and whenever, then yeah.

1216
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Then it probably will be exclusive to PlayStation 3.

1217
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But, right now, since the 360 has a jump on them by millions of units, it's coming out on the 360.

1218
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,000
They would be dumb to just say, oh, you know, we don't like money, so we're just not going to make it for the 360.

1219
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000
It can be made on the 360 as all these other PlayStation 3 games, and it will be made on the 360.

1220
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Just because they're exclusive right now, Sony does pay them for exclusive rights to some of these games.

1221
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And so, after a certain amount of time.

1222
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,000
But the Xbox 360 does not have 6-axis.

1223
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Yeah, and the PlayStation 3 doesn't have rumble.

1224
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Such flimsy controllers.

1225
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Anyways, so, you know, great.

1226
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And speaking of the PlayStation 3, Sony's actually in talks with Amazon for their movie download service.

1227
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And, you know, because PlayStation 3, they're starting to kind of get into the more downloads and everything.

1228
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And I've got to admit, they do have some pretty good stuff on their network service right now,

1229
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
as far as the equivalents to live arcade games.

1230
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Especially, they're getting that Gran Turismo HD demo, which is not bad for free.

1231
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I've got to admit, that's pretty cool.

1232
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And, you know, now they're talking about going the same way as the 360 and offering movie downloads.

1233
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Which, this isn't a big surprise, you know, because it's Sony and they want it to be this media center type thing.

1234
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So, of course, they're talking with Amazon because they have their digital download service as well.

1235
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And probably, you know, going to hook up with them on that.

1236
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But I see this probably happening.

1237
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Especially with the PSP, I think they have their download service as well.

1238
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So, what does this mean for UMDs?

1239
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
This doesn't mean anything for UMDs.

1240
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
It means that people are going to be downloading videos to the PlayStation 3.

1241
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
UMDs, you know, are going to be like UMDs.

1242
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Meaning they're going to be out there, but they're not going to sell.

1243
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Is this to compete with 360's new little marketplace movie thingy?

1244
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Definitely.

1245
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Which I still don't like, because they don't have enough HD movies.

1246
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
They have like five, literally. I count five or six HD movies, that's it.

1247
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
It's literally, it's going to be to compete with that.

1248
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And it's also going to be to compete with iTunes.

1249
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
That's exactly what it's for.

1250
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Alright.

1251
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Well, something else to be competitive in the movie world.

1252
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Ken Kutaragi has spoken with Impress, that's a magazine over in Japan,

1253
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
about an AV-centric PlayStation 3.

1254
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
This would have the cell processor powering,

1255
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
and would, quote, be a standard AV component-sized box

1256
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
with a more powerful power supply unit, anti-shake insulator,

1257
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
and twice the main memory.

1258
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
And then it also goes on to talk about dual HDMI output for this high-end system.

1259
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Now, this is kind of similar to the PSX,

1260
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
which was a version of the PlayStation 2,

1261
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
but it was just very expensive.

1262
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I guess you could kind of compare it to, you know,

1263
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
like the Panasonic Q was like an AV machine,

1264
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
but it also played GameCube games.

1265
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So it's not necessarily that he's talking about replacing the PlayStation 3 already.

1266
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
But to me, it does seem a little early to be talking about this.

1267
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
To me.

1268
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And it's also the dual-

1269
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It's like, make your PlayStation 3s.

1270
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Well, the dual HDMI out, that was originally what they were talking about.

1271
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I remember that.

1272
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
For the original PlayStation 3.

1273
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Yeah.

1274
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Then, you know, apparently that was a little crazy,

1275
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
and also the same with-

1276
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Well, actually, I remember the dual HDMI out for the PlayStation 3

1277
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
was for multiple monitors.

1278
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Remember, they said that if you had two HDTVs,

1279
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
who would have this?

1280
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Sitting next to each other, you could extend your, you know,

1281
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
desktop to be on both of them for-

1282
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I don't know what reason you would need that,

1283
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
and who the hell would have two giant 50-inch, you know,

1284
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
HDTVs next to each other?

1285
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Whatever.

1286
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
But that was one of the things that they were talking about.

1287
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And now the price tag on this, I think what they were saying, $2,500?

1288
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Who the fuck's gonna pay that?

1289
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I mean, seriously.

1290
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
The $600 is too expensive to sell PlayStation 3s.

1291
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Who the hell's gonna pay $2,500 for this?

1292
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Because, I mean, just because it has DVR and stuff,

1293
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
you can build your own, you know, DVR system, high-end,

1294
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
and buy a PlayStation 3 and still do it cheaper than this.

1295
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It's just stupid.

1296
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And the other thing, too, they're saying normal component size.

1297
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Well, that PlayStation 3 is not small by any means.

1298
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It is already normal component size, if not larger.

1299
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I mean, so what's the size of this power brick thing gonna be?

1300
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I mean, is it gonna be the size of, like, a TV or something?

1301
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I mean, seriously, what are they talking about for this stuff?

1302
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I think this is still a ways out, whatever it is.

1303
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I think they need to shut him up, is what they need to do,

1304
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
because he is just spouting off retardedness as time goes on.

1305
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
He really, he doesn't have a grip on reality.

1306
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
All right, well, we issued a challenge to our listeners last week.

1307
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
If you think the Sony spokespeople have no clue what they're doing

1308
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
in the marketing department, create your own Sony ad.

1309
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
And we invited folks to leave us a voicemail on our Skype line,

1310
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
1-877-GAME-OLR, with their best Sony advertisement.

1311
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And we're proud to say we have a winner.

1312
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
First off, we want to thank everybody that called in

1313
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and took the time to enter the contest.

1314
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
It sounds like some people really, like, rode out, you know,

1315
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
creative things to say, and you gave us a lot of laughs.

1316
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
So thanks to all you guys for entering.

1317
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
We want to play for you guys now, the winner.

1318
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Hi, I'm Sony's new spokesperson, Paradox Vincent.

1319
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Now, look, the PS3 has been getting a lot of rap,

1320
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
but I think that it's really just on this communication, you know?

1321
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
You gamer people just don't understand the way the business works.

1322
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
So I'm here to clear some things up.

1323
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
The biggest complaint we've heard is the price.

1324
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Too cheap, I know, but there's nothing we can do about that now.

1325
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Secondly, some people say it freezes.

1326
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
We're putting freezing technology in so that people can really get a feel

1327
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
for the true next generation look and feel on your 1080i television.

1328
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
To really feel like you're driving that car and you're shooting that alien.

1329
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Or how you're in that giant robot.

1330
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
We want you to feel like you're a ninja or whatever,

1331
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
stabbing the giant enemy crab.

1332
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
We get it, you know?

1333
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
We understand that some people might not have HDTV.

1334
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
In fact, a great number of people don't have HDTV,

1335
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
especially not 1080i HDTV.

1336
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Well, we don't care.

1337
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Leave us alone.

1338
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I'm not hearing you, la la, la la la la la.

1339
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
La la, you're stupid.

1340
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
All in all, it's the perfect gaming console, I know.

1341
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
The Wii's a pedophile and the Xbox 360 takes pictures of you while you're sleeping.

1342
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Would you pay $600 for a pedophile or a pervert or a terrorist?

1343
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I wouldn't.

1344
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Make the right move.

1345
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Make the Sony move.

1346
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Congratulations to Paradox Vincent for winning our little contest there.

1347
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I think my favorite part of that is you wouldn't pay $600 to a pedophile or a terrorist.

1348
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
My favorite was la la la la la la.

1349
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
So good job, Paradox Vincent.

1350
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
We're going to send you some random things from our OLR prize pool.

1351
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I know we have a DDR Extreme 2 bundle.

1352
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Yes, that's Extreme 2.

1353
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
That's last year's game, but hey, those DDR pads are not easy to come by.

1354
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
So you get a bundle there and some other stuff as well.

1355
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I think there's a DS game we have to give away too.

1356
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Don't we have a copy of Tao or something that's got to get given away at some point?

1357
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I don't know.

1358
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
You'll see.

1359
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
You'll find out what you get when you get it.

1360
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
All right.

1361
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
What a great contest.

1362
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
You get to win something.

1363
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
A thing, a random.

1364
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Think of it as Santa Claus coming to your house.

1365
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Something's better than nothing.

1366
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Something random from Orange Lounge Radio.

1367
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
We'll be in touch.

1368
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
You win stuff here.

1369
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
More contests to come.

1370
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
We'll probably do something next week, so stay tuned to Orange Lounge Radio.

1371
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Well, I have some news, and this makes me happy.

1372
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Remember Loco Roco?

1373
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Why, yes, I do.

1374
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Is getting a sequel.

1375
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
That's kind of a given.

1376
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
You mean one of the only PSP games people talked about a lot this year?

1377
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Getting a sequel?

1378
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
No way!

1379
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Well, it was announced by Phil Harrison to MTV News.

1380
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Now, this makes me think, though, that quite possibly, I don't know,

1381
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
given that Loco Roco sort of flopped in Japan,

1382
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I'm wondering if they're going to have a more limited release there than they will here.

1383
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I can just hear that.

1384
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I can see the interview now.

1385
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Yeah, we're doing a sequel to Loco Roco.

1386
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I don't like any of those Mexican games.

1387
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
What?

1388
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Because Loco, you know, Loco Roco.

1389
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Loco Roco is great.

1390
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Anyways, whatever.

1391
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I rolled my eyes, too, when she said they went on MTV to announce the sequel,

1392
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
but I don't get where you're going with this.

1393
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
This also looks very...

1394
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
MTV's stupid.

1395
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,000
This picture looks like...

1396
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
A penis?

1397
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Yeah, it does a little bit.

1398
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Jamie sees a penis in everything.

1399
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I do not.

1400
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I bet you wish you were in Second Life this week.

1401
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I know we didn't get around to that story,

1402
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
but there was some chick that was being interviewed in Second Life,

1403
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:53,000
and all these penises flew by on the screen like people threw dicks at her.

1404
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And I was thinking, Jamie should see this.

1405
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I actually tried downloading Second Life,

1406
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
and this is what, again, it was my fandom that inspired me.

1407
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Someone freaking made a TARDIS on Second Life.

1408
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
You nerd.

1409
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Well, it's not fully extra-dimensional like the actual one,

1410
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
but they had it all laid out, and they had the current one,

1411
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
and then they had the Tom Baker era one in the different rooms and stuff.

1412
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I thought that was cool.

1413
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
And then I played Second Life for like five minutes,

1414
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
and then I was like, this game sucks.

1415
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Anyways...

1416
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Yeah, Second Life, I don't get it.

1417
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
But anyways...

1418
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
New Kingdom Hearts?

1419
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Speaking of Jamie fandom...

1420
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Yay!

1421
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Yeah, I'm sure this is news to everybody.

1422
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
They're making another Kingdom Hearts game that's a shocker.

1423
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Shocker! Why?

1424
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Why would they do something like this?

1425
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
It's not like the last game sold millions or anything.

1426
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So yeah, they're making a new Kingdom Hearts game,

1427
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Kingdom Hearts 3,

1428
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
and of course this was sort of announced on the trailer

1429
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:06,000
that they had for Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix during their Jump Festa show in Tokyo.

1430
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Yay!

1431
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And basically saying that a new project was in the works.

1432
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So, Kingdom Hearts 3, something brand new to the series.

1433
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Well, something Kingdom Hearts-ish is coming.

1434
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Yay!

1435
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Yay, they better have space paranoid in it.

1436
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And I'm here to announce something else that Square's going to be doing.

1437
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I know this is going to be a shock to everyone.

1438
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
After Final Fantasy XIII, there will be a Final Fantasy XIV.

1439
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Oh my god!

1440
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
It's coming soon.

1441
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Oh my god.

1442
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Eloki breaks the world exclusive on Final Fantasy XIV.

1443
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Amazing.

1444
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I speculate there will be five versions of it.

1445
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I am actually thinking, let me think,

1446
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:54,000
there will be another Final Fantasy game re-released on some handheld in the near future.

1447
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
There will be some type of re-release of some game from Square.

1448
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
And there's going to be another Final Fantasy VII side story.

1449
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
After Super Mario Galaxy, there will be another Mario game.

1450
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Amazing.

1451
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
And there will be another Zelda game.

1452
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Well, we actually already know about the Zelda game.

1453
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
But there will be a Metroid IV in some capacity.

1454
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
There will be another Metroid game as well.

1455
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
And then they will also re-release a remade version of the old Metroid.

1456
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And despite what the rumors say,

1457
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
if you think they're not going to make a Halo 4 or some type of Halo story,

1458
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
you're kidding yourself.

1459
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
All right, anyway, speaking of games that are going to be kind of expensive,

1460
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
as all those games are going to be,

1461
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
there was an interesting story run by Forbes this week

1462
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
that breaks down the price of a $60 video game.

1463
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Of course, a lot of people are bitching and moaning because games are $60 now.

1464
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I don't know if you've heard.

1465
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
But games are kind of expensive in this day and age.

1466
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
And this is where your money goes.

1467
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
$27 goes towards the making of the game.

1468
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
$15 goes towards art and graphics.

1469
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
$12 goes towards gameplay mechanics.

1470
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Now, $12 goes to the retail markup,

1471
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
meaning that the store you actually buy it from gets $12

1472
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
because it usually costs them about $48.

1473
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
And there's a console owner fee of $7.

1474
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And the retail and publishing parties involved

1475
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
only really get about $1 for every game sold.

1476
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
They might be able to push it to $3 a game

1477
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
if they sell advertising in the manual or do some of that in-game advertising stuff

1478
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
or what have you.

1479
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Interesting.

1480
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
That's where your money goes, if you ever wondered.

1481
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
That's economics for you.

1482
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Well, if you ever wonder where your emails go when you send them to Mailbag

1483
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
at orangeloungeradio.com,

1484
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
they go to the bowels of hell known as Jamie's House,

1485
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
where she opens them up and reads them

1486
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
and finds some of her favorites to read for you all on air.

1487
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
So do you have some mail for us this week, DarkSakura?

1488
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Yes.

1489
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Damn you people, only five this week.

1490
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
What's up with that?

1491
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I expect better of our listeners.

1492
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I heard there was a holiday or something going on.

1493
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
So?

1494
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It doesn't take long to type.

1495
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I type 90 words a minute.

1496
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I have a letter typed up in, you know, three minutes.

1497
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Anyway.

1498
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Nah, but we got some pretty good emails.

1499
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
The first one comes from, I guess it's pronounced Igor.

1500
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
This is Igor, regular listener from Florianopolis, Brazil.

1501
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
That's cool.

1502
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I've been listening to you for quite some time

1503
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
and I consider it a very good podcast.

1504
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Top five on my iTunes every week.

1505
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
By the way, I believe that you should be experiencing some problems in iTunes.

1506
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Stupid thing popped up.

1507
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Sorry, I had my DVD pop up.

1508
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
But I closed my case while it was reading so it covered email.

1509
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Anyway.

1510
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Okay.

1511
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
It's not the first time this happened at least twice in the last month

1512
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
because I downloaded part A and it's only eight minutes long.

1513
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Does anyone also have this issue?

1514
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Keep doing a great job.

1515
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Hope to see you guys down here in South America.

1516
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Sincerely, Igor.

1517
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I don't use iTunes, so I don't know.

1518
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I do.

1519
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I always check to make sure the podcast works okay on iTunes

1520
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
and I've never been able to duplicate the issue.

1521
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
But you're not the first person I've heard to complain about it.

1522
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Unfortunately, there's not a lot we can do on our end.

1523
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I'm not sure what iTunes is doing to cause it or if it's a server thing.

1524
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I think iTunes, if the download moves too slow,

1525
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
and considering how much we get hammered when a new show goes out

1526
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
because we're distributed on the X...

1527
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
God, now I can't remember.

1528
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Xbox Live?

1529
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
No, not Xbox Live.

1530
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
The XB stream.

1531
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Thank you.

1532
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
We're on that and that hits us every 15 minutes,

1533
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
so a lot of people hit our show right when it comes out

1534
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
and I think it might be causing the server to move a little bit slowly.

1535
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
There are other subscription services you can use.

1536
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Yeah, there are other subscriptions you can use to get on the feed

1537
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
or you can go to the feed directly

1538
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
and just go to where it says download our podcast on the main site.

1539
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
You can actually pull the MP3s directly from our page.

1540
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
And there's also, you know, you can use Yahoo podcasts,

1541
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
although they've fallen behind on the listing,

1542
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
so I don't know how much I support that one right now.

1543
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
And Dig, but they mirror the show on their site or something kind of funny,

1544
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
so if you're not going to use iTunes,

1545
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I would suggest maybe like Pod Nova or the, what is that thing called?

1546
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Juice?

1547
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Or something like that that would pull down the MP3s as well

1548
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
or go directly to the feed and save it from there.

1549
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
When I get them, I go to the feed.

1550
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
So I can tell you it's reliable.

1551
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Well, we have another one coming from Gorilla,

1552
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
which is cool because I'm the fan.

1553
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Well, no, I see Gorilla and I instantly think Gorillas.

1554
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Hey, kids, long-time listener and fan of the show.

1555
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Just wanted to comment on some things said on past shows

1556
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
in regards to eBaying Wii or PS3.

1557
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
It's sort of a long one.

1558
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
So forgive me if I paraphrase a little bit.

1559
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I personally have no problem with someone selling their bought and owned device.

1560
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
If I own a PS3 for two minutes or two years,

1561
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I own it and have a right to put it up on eBay,

1562
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
sell it to my coworker or anyone else.

1563
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
If someone thinks this is wrong,

1564
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
then they should have been in line in front of me and got one,

1565
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
and they could have done whatever they want with it.

1566
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
It's not my business.

1567
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,000
In my own defense, I did get a PS3 and I did wait in line for a Wii, so yeah.

1568
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I don't believe people should be getting anything the easy way.

1569
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I think everyone should work hard for what they have.

1570
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Or the game companies should make enough of it.

1571
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Yeah, there's that too.

1572
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I fully blame Sony and Greed for the state of that.

1573
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Excuse me.

1574
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
This is going to be an email.

1575
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I'm going to post on our forums, because it is long.

1576
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
But I'm going to read the last paragraph,

1577
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
because it sort of mirrors a little bit how I feel about it.

1578
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I'm sure you will edit this if you read it on the show,

1579
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
but the bottom line is this is my opinion.

1580
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
If you own something, no matter how long,

1581
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
especially if you put the time and effort to wait in line

1582
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
with a bunch of people who you would never want to stand next to otherwise,

1583
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
it is your right to self-smash, burn, throw out a window, or keep for years

1584
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
before selling it back to GameStop anyway.

1585
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
If people don't like it, then tell them when they see an auction for $3,000

1586
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
on an already overpriced $600 device, don't bid.

1587
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I do agree with that.

1588
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Hold on, I thought you were staunchly against reselling these consoles on eBay.

1589
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
No, no, no.

1590
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I'm going to say this very specifically.

1591
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I am against buying them out for the specific purpose of selling them.

1592
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
For those people who bought 10 PS3s at 10 different stores in Japan

1593
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,000
just for the purpose of selling them online, I have a problem with that.

1594
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I don't have a problem with someone, you know, and I did think about it.

1595
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I will admit when I can change my opinion about things

1596
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
after putting lots of thought into it.

1597
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Say that this is your college tuition.

1598
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I don't have a problem with that.

1599
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I mean, if you take it home and say you, I actually don't have a problem

1600
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
if you take it home, play this, if you know this is shit, and put it on eBay,

1601
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I don't have a problem with that at all.

1602
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Now, the one problem I have though with using it to make a profit for, say,

1603
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
your bills or for your mortgage is that it's gambling.

1604
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I'm not a gambling person.

1605
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Even though, yeah, just about everyone who sold one on eBay

1606
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
has gotten a lot of money for it, you never know if you're going to get,

1607
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
you know, a bum deal on it or if it's not going to go through

1608
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
and you've wasted $600.

1609
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I love me the slot machines once in a while.

1610
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I like to gamble, but yet I won't do this.

1611
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
And it's, you know, I'm not so, you know, I guess if people are,

1612
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
if eBay is going to let them do it, then, you know, they have the right to do it

1613
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
as much as I may not like it or I may not want to do it myself.

1614
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
But I do blame the buyer almost more than the seller.

1615
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I blame the buyer for making that demand.

1616
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Well, that's exactly the point.

1617
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
It's all those people who are not willing to put any effort into anything.

1618
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
See, okay.

1619
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
It's stupidity.

1620
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
If you're putting the effort into it and buying it, yeah, okay, you can sell it.

1621
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I still don't think it's right, but it is your right to do so.

1622
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I agree with that.

1623
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I don't think it's right for, again, those people who were basically

1624
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
getting the edge on the market by buying 100 PS3s and selling them on eBay.

1625
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
That's, yeah, that's much.

1626
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
That's sick.

1627
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
That's abuse.

1628
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
That's sick.

1629
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
But I think that, yeah, all those people, though, who are paying the money for them on eBay,

1630
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
gouge them.

1631
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Make them pay.

1632
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
You know, because they didn't stand in line and put any damn effort into it.

1633
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
You know, those people deserve to get ripped off.

1634
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
And if it's disposable income, then you know what?

1635
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
They need to take those people away from, you know, their disposable income

1636
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
and make them go work hard for something.

1637
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,000
You know, I have a problem with that.

1638
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I think that people should actually have to work hard for what they have

1639
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
instead of just having it handed to them on a platter.

1640
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Although I don't mind when anybody hands me anything on a platter,

1641
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
but I also work hard for everything else I have.

1642
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It's a different story if you just get everything you want.

1643
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
If you work hard, you should be able to get something.

1644
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,000
But anyway, thanks and love the show for keeping up all the good work and reviews.

1645
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I did buy an Xbox 360 and am keeping it.

1646
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Oh, you're cool.

1647
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
It's from Gorilla.

1648
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Post your game and tag on the forums.

1649
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Join the OL Army.

1650
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Email from Chicago.

1651
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Once in a while you should have a retro game segment and feature a past system

1652
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
such as the 3DO game system, which I loved and still own.

1653
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Okay, you're entitled to that.

1654
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I was way ahead of you.

1655
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Yeah, you're allowed to love it if you really want to love that system.

1656
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Before PS1 came out and killed it.

1657
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:33,000
You know, actually, you must have ESPN, I mean, ESP,

1658
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
because look for something like that to be coming out next year.

1659
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
All right.

1660
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
There's more.

1661
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Right.

1662
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
More emails from mailbag at orangeontrader.com.

1663
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I'm going to have Learn Giants by the time I'm done with this segment.

1664
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
That's all right.

1665
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Hey, guys and girls, yes, Jamie, I wouldn't forget your angsty self.

1666
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Oh, thank you.

1667
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,000
It's Nim, and yeah, it's been going good down here in Texas, I suppose.

1668
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
The stars at night shine big and bright.

1669
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Ow.

1670
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I can't clap with the microphone in my hand.

1671
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Sorry, can't help it.

1672
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Pee-wee.

1673
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Just recently I had an idea for a game.

1674
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Now, don't you start spouting off, I smell a kamami lawsuit.

1675
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Konami will sue.

1676
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Hey.

1677
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
But I was thinking of making a step mania type game for the arcade.

1678
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I have ideas and such, but right now nothing has been done,

1679
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
and I'm trying to get the word out.

1680
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
So you can say I love your show, and I know everybody else should.

1681
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Maybe I can find some help with this.

1682
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I'm not going to read out the email yet.

1683
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Enough of my shameless self-promoting or whatever.

1684
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Hold on.

1685
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
If it's going to change subjects,

1686
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I want to talk about the step mania thing for just a minute.

1687
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Isn't that just in the groove?

1688
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I imagine this person must have some type of separate idea

1689
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
that differentiates it from in the groove,

1690
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
but it wasn't in the groove, just step mania in your case?

1691
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Yeah.

1692
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
And, Loki, you actually had a step mania cabinet

1693
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
that you helped build for a local arcade.

1694
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Tell us briefly, in a minute or so,

1695
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
what was your experience with that?

1696
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
It was a pain in the ass.

1697
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Why, what happened?

1698
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Just the computer...

1699
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Normal computers don't like normal arcade cabinet environments.

1700
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
In other words, they get too damn hot.

1701
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
At the time, I didn't have the right tools

1702
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
to basically put an image on that type of a screen

1703
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
because the arcade screens run at what they call CGA,

1704
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
which is a very low resolution screen.

1705
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,000
But, it looks nice in the arcade because it's a really old screen.

1706
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
But, it's a pain in the ass.

1707
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Let me put it that way.

1708
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
But now, within the grooves, arcade stuff,

1709
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
since they just run a PC anyways,

1710
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:36,000
you can actually buy a lot of this stuff from third party manufacturers

1711
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
and be able to create your own step mania cabinet really easy now.

1712
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And, in fact, they actually built step mania builds

1713
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
meant for arcade cabinets.

1714
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
So, if you build a cool enough computer,

1715
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
and it's also hard, too,

1716
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
because you have to get the computer to turn on

1717
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
with the actual cabinet stuff.

1718
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
But, if you can rig that all up,

1719
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
then, yeah, it's pretty easy to do once you've got the setup.

1720
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Alright.

1721
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
To continue with the email.

1722
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Let me get to my main point.

1723
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I recently picked up a Nintendo DS

1724
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
and was hoping to pick up a copy of Final Fantasy III for it

1725
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
at the closest GameStop.

1726
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Now, well, I have a good reason to get all angsty about the franchise now,

1727
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
seeing as how they didn't even have a copy in.

1728
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Before this, they sold me a defective 2DX game.

1729
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

1730
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
That sounds like me.

1731
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
So, yeah, that's all I really have to say.

1732
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Still waiting to get a 360, or are we me being the poor bastard I am.

1733
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Um, you know what?

1734
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I suggest, um, I don't really think it's the GameStop

1735
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
because they have the stock that they have at the time.

1736
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Use your phone.

1737
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Give them a call.

1738
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
You know, I live close to three GameStops.

1739
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
If I had been told by a GameStop rep previously,

1740
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I'm too busy to look, come down here.

1741
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
And that's when I decided I wasn't going to support that particular store anymore.

1742
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I realized that was that store and not the chain as a whole,

1743
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
but that's when I realized I wasn't ever going to go down there ever.

1744
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Then again, usually all I have to do is say, hey, this is Dan's wife.

1745
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Well, you know, I don't get on the phone and go,

1746
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I have a podcast on the internet, so you damn well better help me,

1747
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
or I'm going to talk shit about you.

1748
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
No, I just call like anyone else does, you know?

1749
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Well, I mean, usually what I do is I call,

1750
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
and then if it's one of the managers I've met before,

1751
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
then I'll say, hey, yeah, it's me.

1752
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,000
But honestly, though, really, I've found a few people who are willing to look

1753
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
and say, hey, I'm going to be coming by if you have this.

1754
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I'm going to be giving you money if you have this.

1755
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
But I've been in a GameStop when it's busy,

1756
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
and when they say they don't have time to look,

1757
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
it means they don't have time to look.

1758
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
That is the fault of not having enough employees to handle the issues then.

1759
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I'm sorry.

1760
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
And having been sort of on the inside of it,

1761
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
that is the fault of GameStop corporate.

1762
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Then there you go.

1763
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
They do not want to give the hours they need to man the stores.

1764
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Well, it's hurting your business, folks.

1765
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I'm not going back to that store.

1766
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
It's not the manager's fault.

1767
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I teach customer service for a living.

1768
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I get offended when people do that kind of stuff.

1769
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Well, I was in customer service for a while too,

1770
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
and I know what I expect of myself.

1771
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Well, you know, what if they're too busy at that one time?

1772
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Then obviously they're too busy to ring me up at the register.

1773
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Can I put you on hold, you know,

1774
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
and they could have one employee that's not necessarily working the register

1775
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
because not everyone ever has to be working the register at the time.

1776
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
They have one employee to check on that.

1777
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
You know, can I put you on hold, you know, and...

1778
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
They are supposed to put you on hold.

1779
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
No.

1780
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
And they are supposed to have you on hold as long as you're on hold.

1781
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I walked right over to the next...

1782
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
You know what?

1783
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Instead, I walked right over to the next store Best Buy,

1784
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
picked up my game, left, in and out, very easy,

1785
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
and that's where I bought all my games for a little while.

1786
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Well, you know, and it's not really, I think,

1787
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
so much the fault of the store managers

1788
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
because having talked to a number of them,

1789
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
they're all like, we need more hours.

1790
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
We need more hours.

1791
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
We need more hours.

1792
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And it's corporate that's not giving it to them, so blame them.

1793
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
No, I don't know whose fault it is, but it sucks.

1794
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
End of story.

1795
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Last one comes from Nekky.

1796
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I guess that's how it's pronounced.

1797
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Downloaded for the first time off iTunes

1798
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
and it's great, nice community feel to it.

1799
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I'm from the UK, so can't do any of the live forums, et cetera.

1800
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Like to hear a few more stories about the UK.

1801
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I do our best.

1802
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I look when I can.

1803
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
WePlay is already out in the UK.

1804
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
In the last podcast, you said it wasn't out,

1805
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
but maybe that's only in the US.

1806
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
We probably were talking about the US

1807
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
because we're not getting it until February,

1808
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
and I know we had a big story on the delay of WePlay last week.

1809
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Whereas you guys, I think you are just now getting Wii Sports,

1810
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
whereas we had it as a pack-in with our system,

1811
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
so it was kind of interesting.

1812
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Anyway, looking forward to the next podcast.

1813
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Till next time, Nekky.

1814
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I'm really actually, I do try to look for UK specific stuff,

1815
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
more like Europe in general.

1816
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I mean, honestly, I myself have a lot of love for the UK,

1817
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
and I want to make sure that our folks are covered.

1818
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Keep in mind, a big part of it is, too,

1819
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
is that a lot of stuff, and I don't mean to offend or worry,

1820
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
but a lot of stuff comes up in Japan in the US first,

1821
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
and then the UK just kind of gets it later.

1822
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Not to say that there aren't specific things in the UK, obviously,

1823
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
and Jamie tries to stay on top of those,

1824
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
but just kind of the nature of the business is,

1825
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
most of the business is done in Tokyo and in the Bay Area.

1826
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
So we try to keep tabs on release dates and things of that nature,

1827
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
because we heart our international listeners,

1828
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
but keep in mind, usually when games are under development and things,

1829
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
it is kind of over on this side.

1830
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
But then again, they do get some games that we don't get,

1831
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
like mostly football.

1832
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Once in a while, once in a while.

1833
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Some of the games of that nature.

1834
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I try to keep my eyes open for specific ones.

1835
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
So think of it this way.

1836
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Hey, at least if we're getting the games first,

1837
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
we can tell you which ones suck,

1838
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
and then that way you don't even have to blink an eye

1839
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
when they come out over there.

1840
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Exactly.

1841
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
For what little it's worth,

1842
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
because we can't force the companies to change their schedule or whatever.

1843
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
By the way, I think we had a slightly increased listenership this week,

1844
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
because iTunes had us,

1845
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
they have video games as their featured category and podcast this week,

1846
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
and we're one of them that's in the little box.

1847
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
So that's kind of cool.

1848
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
So thank you iTunes.

1849
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Is that it for voicemails?

1850
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
That would be it.

1851
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Alrighty.

1852
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
You mean emails?

1853
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Oh yeah, emails, sorry.

1854
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Give them my voice.

1855
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to leave us a voicemail,

1856
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,000
because we're not unable to be live until January of 2007.

1857
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I want voicemail from some of our overseas listeners now.

1858
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
That's true.

1859
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
This listener could call our voicemail any time.

1860
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Now don't use the 800, but you can go through Skype.

1861
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Oh yeah, sorry, that's right.

1862
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
International folks don't want to use it, unless you're Canadian.

1863
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Unless you're Canadian.

1864
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
You can use the 800.

1865
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
But download Skype.

1866
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
You can actually just send us the message through the Skype line.

1867
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
It's a voiceover IP.

1868
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
It costs your internet connection.

1869
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
That's it.

1870
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
That's it.

1871
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
So go to orangesonusradio.com and click on Interact With Us for more information.

1872
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
It's all free.

1873
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
All free?

1874
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Yes, please.

1875
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Excellent.

1876
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Well, getting back into some news here.

1877
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
One thing that we talk about, especially in games and stuff, is all these ads.

1878
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,000
And a big thing when we were doing the Battlefield 2142 stuff

1879
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:02,000
was that their advertisements had a little kind of a spyware feel to it

1880
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
because they were picking up your IP and where you're located and that kind of thing

1881
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
so they could target ads towards you.

1882
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Not a huge deal to some people, but a big deal to others.

1883
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Well, apparently it's a big deal to some Californian lawmakers.

1884
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:24,000
California Assemblywoman Lori Saldana is going to be working on introducing a bill

1885
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
into state legislation that would halt companies like EA

1886
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
from including spyware technology in games.

1887
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And they found certain methods used by these companies as particularly vile, as she puts it,

1888
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,000
and definitely something that I'd like to see passed because I'm not sure.

1889
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I don't think it's on our show roll.

1890
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
We were talking about advertising in games and somehow it's not very effective.

1891
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:56,000
And so gathering information from these companies and EA is really bad on this,

1892
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
especially with where you have to sign up and have your credit card information and stuff like that.

1893
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It's not good.

1894
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,000
What I'm interested in is, she seems to get it.

1895
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Yeah.

1896
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Who is she? How did she figure out about it?

1897
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I mean, is she a gamer?

1898
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
No, it's just, I don't know, she just seems to get it.

1899
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Because one thing we felt like we haven't had much of in the political world

1900
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
is some type of pro-gaming champion.

1901
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I don't mean like a professional gamer,

1902
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
but I mean like somebody who supports the video games and the gaming community.

1903
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
We've certainly had a lot of anti.

1904
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I think she's kind of interested in, it's mainly privacy experts.

1905
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I see, so she's more of like an EFF type champion.

1906
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Yeah, and I think this just kind of relates a little bit to stuff like that.

1907
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,000
And basically she's saying that it doesn't advertise it on the outside of the packaging

1908
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
and it contains the stuff.

1909
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
It's like you bought it and then, oh, by the way,

1910
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:57,000
we forgot to mention that installing this will actually send us some private data.

1911
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And you need to do this in order to play the game.

1912
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I would just like to see someone who gets gaming in Congress, that's all.

1913
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Jamie, run for Congress.

1914
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Okay, pay my way.

1915
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Vote for Jamie, Kay, thanks.

1916
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Yeah, vote for Jamie, or die.

1917
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,000
All right, anyway, well that should be interesting to see what happens with that.

1918
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I think that's kind of cool.

1919
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I think it's something that should, I think the companies should know.

1920
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
They're going to be looked at if they're going to use these type of tactics, so I support it.

1921
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I'm curious to see what the specifics of the bill will be.

1922
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Since this is our holiday episode, this last official story we have for you guys

1923
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
has to do with Bethesda and their big, big, big game Oblivion.

1924
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,000
They are giving away for Christmas a brand new expansion pack for Oblivion.

1925
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Well, it's not new, but it's...

1926
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I was going to say, it's a Christmas theme pack or whatever.

1927
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
No, it's not a theme pack either.

1928
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
It's one of the older expansions. They dropped the price to free.

1929
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Oh, I thought it was a new one.

1930
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Oh, all right, well, whatever.

1931
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Maroon's Razor, which I guess used to cost money, it's now being offered for free.

1932
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Well, that sucks to everyone who bought it before.

1933
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Never mind, these guys are grinches for doing that to those people.

1934
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Unfortunately, I have not played any of the Oblivion expansions.

1935
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I apologize for my mistake.

1936
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
You know what expansion pack I'm going to be downloading?

1937
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
What? The Saints Row Ho-Ho-Ho pack.

1938
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Ho-Ho-Ho, does it come with Ho-Ho-Hos?

1939
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
It comes with Christmas themed stuff.

1940
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
You know, I'm sorry, we missed this in our story.

1941
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I don't remember this being mentioned unless I just forgot.

1942
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Gran Turismo HD is coming for free as well from Sony.

1943
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
So, tis the season.

1944
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
So, I guess Nintendo is the Grinch after all, not putting out anything for you.

1945
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Well, they did have the internet channel, so maybe not.

1946
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,000
They did give you that and the forecast channel coming up the news channel too.

1947
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
But the internet channel, you know, is free.

1948
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
So, I guess we all got a little something for Christmas.

1949
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Now, here's something I got to mention though, and I'm not sure if you noticed.

1950
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Wii Connect 24, what the fuck does it actually do?

1951
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Because it sure as hell doesn't update my system.

1952
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
It sure as hell doesn't download this new stuff automatically.

1953
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
What the fuck?

1954
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I think it's one of those wait and see things with later games.

1955
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I think it's the type of thing where, you know, Animal Crossing,

1956
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
people will visit your village when you're not there, type of thing.

1957
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Like, I mean, seriously, because, you know,

1958
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
it was supposed to be downloading the updates automatically so I wouldn't have to.

1959
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Like, so, poof, the internet channel should be there,

1960
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
or the forecast channel should be there instead of having to,

1961
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
oh, by the way, the forecast channel is there, hit update, you know.

1962
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
No, it should be automatic.

1963
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Well, at least you get that message.

1964
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
That's, I don't know, you have the message, right?

1965
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Nintendo sent you a little email that said the forecast channel is now available, right?

1966
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Yeah, great, good for them, but it's not, you know, this Wii Connect 24.

1967
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
It's always connected to the internet.

1968
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
No, it's always connected, but it's not doing anything.

1969
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
All right.

1970
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Well, we have another segment here before we close out the show,

1971
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
and that would be Dark Sakura, who likes to surf the internet up and down and left and right

1972
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
and all that be-a-select-start kind of stuff.

1973
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,000
She finds a website that she must share with all of you guys,

1974
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
and it's called Dark Sakura's Website of the Week.

1975
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
And we have happy music.

1976
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
So this week's website better be happy.

1977
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I didn't do crap to find it.

1978
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
You told me about it.

1979
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Oh, goody, you used my pick.

1980
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I made a suggestion, and it got picked.

1981
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I'm so excited.

1982
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Wekitty.com, W-I-I-K-I-T-T-Y dot com.

1983
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
This site is crack.

1984
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
It has a gallery of cats and Wiis, and it's so cute.

1985
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
You can see the kitty.

1986
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
So it's like stuff on my cat but with Wii controllers?

1987
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Yeah.

1988
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
This is awesome.

1989
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
This is fantastic.

1990
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I need to do one with Shermie.

1991
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,000
And on top of that, they actually say Happy Catter Day, which makes me think of 4chan.

1992
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
So, yeah, this is cute and those are kitties.

1993
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I'm going to submit Shermie on Wekitty.

1994
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I'm going to go look at Wekitty on my Wii and bookmark it as a favorite.

1995
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I actually have Shermie snuggling up to an Xbox 360 controller.

1996
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
There you go.

1997
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Well, you should make 360kitty.com.

1998
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
No, I'm not going to pay for domain.

1999
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
They're cheap.

2000
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Loki, you can do it.

2001
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I can do it.

2002
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
You should put like ps3kitty.com and have a PS3 crushing the cat because it's so heavy.

2003
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:23,000
No, I got it catbox360 and have like, do like litter boxes up like an Xbox.

2004
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
That would be rad.

2005
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I did notice that Wekitty did use the opportunity to give a big fat plug for the people who

2006
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
made it their own personal little game review site.

2007
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
So, you know, we could use 360kitty or whatever as a big plug.

2008
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I don't know.

2009
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I want to jump on the bandwagon.

2010
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
How about the Xbox puppy?

2011
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Where's the love for the puppies?

2012
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Puppies are stinky and they require too much attention.

2013
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I would admit that I'm a cat person over a dog person, but I do think puppies do deserve

2014
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
a little bit of love.

2015
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,000
How about dsgerbils.com?

2016
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Lovehamster.com.

2017
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
There you go.

2018
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
With a P.

2019
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
When you say love hamster, start thinking of that corn cob vibrator and thinking that

2020
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
they should do like a hamster vibrator.

2021
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
No.

2022
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Last minute stories, anyone?

2023
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Yes.

2024
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Are UK listeners want UK news?

2025
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I got some.

2026
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Pro Evolution Soccer 6.

2027
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
What's Cheerio then?

2028
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Hey.

2029
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
You know what?

2030
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I hate all the ads on this.

2031
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Okay.

2032
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Pro Evolution Soccer 6 is now a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace.

2033
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,000
It's the rival of FIFA 07.

2034
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:46,000
It's only available for Xbox Gold, but it will be available to Silver on the 29th.

2035
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
It's a 1.31 gigabyte game.

2036
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Tell us what's on it because we don't know.

2037
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I'm not a football girl.

2038
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Isn't this the same one we saw an early build of at the Panami BBQ?

2039
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Yes.

2040
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Pro Evolution.

2041
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
It looked pretty hot for soccer.

2042
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Not that I'm necessarily.

2043
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Okay.

2044
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I have to say I do love football a little bit.

2045
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
You're a rugby girl.

2046
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
No.

2047
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,000
When I say football, I mean soccer because American football is shit.

2048
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Pure and simple.

2049
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Sorry.

2050
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
It is.

2051
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
It's crap.

2052
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
It's a crap sport and it's just crap.

2053
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,000
More people will probably watch football if they had cheerleaders like American football.

2054
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
It seems to be the most popular sport in this nation.

2055
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Yeah, and the rest of the world says, screw you, that's stupid.

2056
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
We like real football.

2057
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
It gives me excuse to watch men in shorts.

2058
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I like basketball.

2059
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Yeah, but you know what?

2060
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:49,000
The rest of the world may be all about this metric system, but hey, we're too good for that.

2061
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,000
It's all about fucking base 12 systems.

2062
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Hell yeah.

2063
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
You mean the imperial system?

2064
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Yeah.

2065
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Well, doesn't it sound much nicer to hear that it's 40 degrees Fahrenheit outside?

2066
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
It doesn't sound so bad as negative two.

2067
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Anyway, forget it.

2068
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Never mind.

2069
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Well, there's another one as well.

2070
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:20,000
For the record, I agree the metric system is better just to get that on record.

2071
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Nintendo has stated that the reports that came out of France saying that Wii Sports

2072
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:30,000
was already in development is, quote, a rumor and speculation.

2073
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
But pretty good speculation of that, honestly.

2074
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Well, NGC France reported that there was one that might include swimming, basketball, a

2075
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
few other sports.

2076
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,000
The quote, though, coming from Nintendo is really pleased with the reaction to Wii Sports.

2077
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:51,000
From people completely new to gaming to the hardcore fans, everywhere has taken to it

2078
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
straight away.

2079
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:58,000
That's a quote from one of the Nintendo UK spokespeople, and they're actually speculating

2080
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
it might be the most popular game.

2081
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Interesting.

2082
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
The love for Wii soccer.

2083
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Dude, that would be cool.

2084
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Would you kick your controller around that?

2085
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I know.

2086
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
How would you do that?

2087
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,000
You put your controller in the ball mode.

2088
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Well, it detects directions.

2089
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
That's a great idea.

2090
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Then people can kick the ball around the house because the Wiis aren't breaking enough

2091
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
things around the house as it is.

2092
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Kick a ball through the window.

2093
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Real smart, Jamie.

2094
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
A winner is you.

2095
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Was I serious?

2096
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
No.

2097
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Partially.

2098
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
No.

2099
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Do you need to come out with the Wii Battle Axe?

2100
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Dude, could you bet a golden axe on the Wii?

2101
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
No, I want, what was that, Time Killers or whatever that game was.

2102
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Remember back in the day when Mortal Kombat was big?

2103
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
You had that game, what was it?

2104
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:50,000
You had two buttons for arm and two for legs and one for head, and that was the game.

2105
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
What was that?

2106
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
It was like Time Killers or something like that?

2107
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I don't remember.

2108
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Oh my god, that game was awesome.

2109
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I mean, it was kind of stupid in the gameplay value, but getting to chop people's arms and

2110
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:05,000
legs off and then they still have to fight with no arms or legs was really funny.

2111
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Clay Fighter, man?

2112
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Your arm's off.

2113
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Alright, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

2114
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Of course I do.

2115
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:16,160
So, the story came out, apparently there's a way modifying your own DVD firmware in your

2116
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:19,800
own CD-ROM drive or DVD-ROM drive on your PC.

2117
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:26,160
You're able to rip Wii discs, so now the pirates have won yet another battle.

2118
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:30,040
It's only a matter of time before we see pirated games, you can run on the Wii.

2119
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:33,520
Until Nintendo says, oh, you want that news channel?

2120
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,280
That's what they'll use Wii Connect 24 with the updates.

2121
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:39,800
They'll just silently push out the updates that'll patch that kind of shit.

2122
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:42,720
Well, they haven't done it yet.

2123
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:43,720
We'll see.

2124
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,600
And who says I have to connect it to the internet while I'm playing these games?

2125
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:52,040
And to be honest, if they can burn them the exact same way as the discs are burnt now,

2126
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,040
they'll never know.

2127
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,040
We'll see.

2128
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:55,040
We'll see.

2129
01:32:55,040 --> 01:33:01,620
Anyways, that being said, let's see here, also, it's kind of funny, you know how if

2130
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:07,000
you register three games with Nintendo that you get a free three month trial to Nintendo

2131
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Power?

2132
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,340
Well, apparently the folks at gonintendo.com found out that the Wii internet channel counts

2133
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:17,920
as a game and now they get a free subscription.

2134
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,920
That's kind of funny.

2135
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:19,920
Does it really?

2136
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,600
I mean, I have my subscription a lot of the time, but I actually have all my Nintendo

2137
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:25,840
products registered on Nintendo and it's a lot now because of those stinking virtual

2138
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:26,840
console games.

2139
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:30,640
I have the virtual console tied to my Nintendo account and you get credit for all those games

2140
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,640
you download.

2141
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:34,760
I really wish here in the US they did some type of reward systems like they did in the

2142
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:37,300
other countries.

2143
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:42,520
If you're using the Wii browser and find that you really want tabbed browsing in the Wii,

2144
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:43,520
well fear not.

2145
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,960
The website has actually figured out a way to do that.

2146
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:58,080
If you want to browse tabbed websites, you can check out team-dsx.net slash ds slash

2147
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:04,440
basic dot php and apparently this was used for the Opera browser on the DS, but can also

2148
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:09,520
be used for the Wii Opera browser to add tabbed browsing functionality.

2149
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:14,360
I don't want tabbed browsing so much as I want support for my USB keyboard.

2150
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:17,560
That would be nice.

2151
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:24,820
And of course, since there was the free Gran Turismo HD demo being put out there, it actually

2152
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:32,080
ended up leaking a little bit early on the Playstation 3 network and crashed it because

2153
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:36,720
it was more than it can handle, which is kind of fun.

2154
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:43,280
We mentioned that Bethesda is putting out the free Oblivion expansion, or I should say

2155
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:50,400
dropping the price on it, but more companies are actually putting out new content as well.

2156
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:56,260
Test Drive Unlimited being one of those, you can now download a 1971 Dodge Challenger RT

2157
01:34:56,260 --> 01:35:00,240
in the game for free and that's available in all regions.

2158
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:06,800
Also going along with that, the Test Drive Racers Guild download set, which is 350 Microsoft

2159
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:20,600
points, includes the Ferrari 612 and the McLaren F1 GT, Dodge Viper SRT10 coupe, and many more.

2160
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:22,040
So that's kind of cool.

2161
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:30,960
They've also got a free Forza Motorsports Showdown trailer, which is available on both

2162
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,960
Canada and US Xbox Live.

2163
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:41,960
And then also three different Command & Conquer Tiberian Wars themes as well can be downloaded

2164
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:47,040
for 150 points each, and actually they do have a trailer as well for that, which is

2165
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,680
of course free.

2166
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:56,120
And finally, Transformers, the movie trailer leaked out this week and was pretty awesome

2167
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:57,120
on Yahoo.

2168
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:03,600
I'm kind of surprised it wasn't that bad, and keep in mind I'm not as attached to Transformers.

2169
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:22,960
You haven't seen the Transformers movie trailer?

2170
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:27,840
Speaking of the trailer, apparently there was some interesting stuff shown during the

2171
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:32,240
trailer between the 37 second and 39 second mark on there.

2172
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:39,160
There's a frame that shows Sector 7 Org at the top and Takara-83 at the bottom.

2173
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:46,880
And apparently that, if you go to sector7.org and enter in Takara-83, it starts an ARG.

2174
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:52,080
So brand new alternate reality game tied in with the Transformers thing, a new viral campaign.

2175
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:56,660
And then when you solve it, you get forwarded to All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com.

2176
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:57,660
Isn't that amazing?

2177
01:36:57,660 --> 01:36:58,660
Yeah, that'd be funny.

2178
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:04,000
No, but it's a brand new start, so definitely worth checking out, I guess.

2179
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Alrighty.

2180
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:13,360
Oh, and I'd like to also mention, just to kind of start the show the way I started it,

2181
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:18,320
1UP is reporting Earth Defense Force 2017 is coming to the US, and I do believe I mentioned

2182
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,160
that on an earlier podcast.

2183
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,160
So humble.

2184
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,600
The great and humble Loki.

2185
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,160
Alright, that's it.

2186
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:29,600
It's only a one-part show tonight, because the holiday and the pre-tape and everything.

2187
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,040
So this is the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2188
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,040
And I'll start tonight.

2189
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:39,720
My final thought is January 22nd and heroes returning to TV.

2190
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:40,960
I can't wait.

2191
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,580
It's too long.

2192
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:46,760
At least I have some Kiefer Sutherland to hold me over.

2193
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,760
Let me know when my man is on that show so I can come watch it.

2194
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:50,800
He's supposed to be on the first episode.

2195
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,200
So what is that?

2196
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,640
January 22nd, so you better watch the first 11 before that.

2197
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:55,640
What night is that?

2198
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:56,640
It's Sunday.

2199
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:57,640
F school.

2200
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:58,640
Damn you.

2201
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:00,520
Well, that's...

2202
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:02,760
And on the 8th day the Lord gave us TiVo.

2203
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:08,880
Yeah, and also just to mention, the volume is going to be on sort of moderate hiatus.

2204
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:09,880
More info on the website.

2205
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:10,880
Yeah.

2206
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:11,880
Alright.

2207
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:12,880
I didn't mean to...

2208
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:13,880
No, that's alright.

2209
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:14,880
Your final thought, then Dark Sakura.

2210
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,280
Um, I need new lungs.

2211
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,280
And reject false icons.

2212
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,280
Loki?

2213
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:24,400
Um, my final thought is, I'm not buying more Ubisoft games.

2214
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:28,080
Thanks, I want to get somebody from that company on the show so bad.

2215
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,080
I want a one-on-one with Loki.

2216
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:34,640
Alright, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent radio.

2217
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:35,680
We really appreciate it.

2218
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:38,520
You guys keep it alive and keep us going here.

2219
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,660
We can't wait to head into 2007.

2220
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:41,800
We got one more show for you guys.

2221
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:44,160
It's going to be a wacky show next week.

2222
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:47,800
Also, next week or the week after one of those shows, we're going to be celebrating our second

2223
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:52,400
year, or I should say, moving into our third year of podcasting.

2224
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,560
If you can believe it, we've been doing podcasting for a while now.

2225
01:38:55,560 --> 01:39:00,160
And of course, on the 29th, Club OLR will be debuting on Friday.

2226
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,160
Thank you for reminding me.

2227
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:02,160
7pm.

2228
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:03,160
More news on the site to come.

2229
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:04,160
Yes.

2230
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:05,160
You need to post in your forum more information.

2231
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,160
I'm sorry.

2232
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:07,160
Loki.

2233
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:08,160
Slacking, humble Loki.

2234
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,160
Alright.

2235
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,160
Thank you guys so much.

2236
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,160
