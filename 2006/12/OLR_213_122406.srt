00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:24,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, December 24th, 2006, some new channels make their debut on the Wii, a California lawmaker targets spyware in games, and is Katamari about to roll over Xbox Live Arcade?

2
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:37,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:42,231
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:48,894
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:49,354 --> 00:00:49,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo.

6
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:51,155
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, Miss Thing?

7
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:51,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Hackin'.

8
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:53,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little sick today?

9
00:00:53,396 --> 00:00:58,378
[SPEAKER_07]: A little of that and trying to play with my IP on my computer so I can fool the BBC.

10
00:00:58,739 --> 00:00:59,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

11
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:01,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Santa bring you the flu, the plague?

12
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:04,613
[SPEAKER_07]: The plague has returned, but not nearly as bad.

13
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm prepared for it this time around.

14
00:01:06,354 --> 00:01:06,954
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good to hear.

15
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:10,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello as well to the always prepared Techmaster, Loki!

16
00:01:10,757 --> 00:01:11,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

17
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,117
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, Loki?

18
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:14,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I was doing okay.

19
00:01:14,338 --> 00:01:15,219
[SPEAKER_04]: You were doing okay?

20
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:15,719
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll mention it later.

22
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:19,081
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,103
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of the same crap, you know, where people are reporting exclusive stories that I have reported weeks ago type thing.

24
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:30,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I told you, go post this in the forum in your little thread there.

25
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:30,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

26
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:33,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I did do that stuff.

27
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:34,226
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

28
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:37,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying post the person who's saying that they have the exclusive story.

29
00:01:37,928 --> 00:01:41,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Post that there and, you know, the listeners can see for themselves there.

30
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is one of the best kept secrets on the internet.

31
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:46,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

32
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:47,698
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:07,247
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

34
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:26,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, that's... You know, as much crap as I give mobile phone games on this program, I actually really enjoyed the Luminous one.

35
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:27,616
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't bad for mobile.

36
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:29,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to reinstall Super Pac-Man.

37
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:30,778
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not worth it.

38
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,259
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too damn hard to play.

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,080
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same.

40
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:42,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not really... It's a good emulation of it, but it's just difficult with a... You need one of the bigger phones to do it, and I have a very small phone.

41
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,648
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what cell phone game I have on my phone?

42
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:45,069
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

43
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:45,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Burger Time.

44
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:46,830
[SPEAKER_07]: You're crazy.

45
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:50,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking about downloading Tetris.

46
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:51,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it'll work.

47
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:54,857
[SPEAKER_04]: The one I have on mine, I know we have different carriers.

48
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:56,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the Jamdat Tetris?

49
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:56,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

50
00:02:57,281 --> 00:02:58,543
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very blue.

51
00:02:58,964 --> 00:02:59,465
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not bad.

52
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to mention, just real quick.

53
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

54
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care, but Dan's been wanting an indie for a while, and that's pretty cool.

55
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:41,293
[SPEAKER_07]: When are you going to get PinBot?

56
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:42,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I want one.

57
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:43,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, we want JackBot.

58
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:47,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, you know, your fancy schmancy bootlegs or whatever.

59
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:48,877
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a bootleg.

60
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:53,579
[SPEAKER_07]: JackBot is the modern pinball version.

61
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, whatever.

62
00:03:54,419 --> 00:04:00,682
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got the same tracks as PinBot and has the bonus segment from Bride of PinBot.

63
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:02,537
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, whatever.

64
00:04:02,738 --> 00:04:03,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really cool.

65
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:06,300
[SPEAKER_07]: However, we do have friends who have a pinbot, so I can just go over there and play it anytime I want.

66
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,242
[SPEAKER_04]: But does it do the thing where it goes, I am pinbot?

67
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:09,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

68
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:10,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

69
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,305
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a fully functional pinbot, and that game is fucking hard.

70
00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:16,387
[SPEAKER_04]: On the NES, it was pretty hard, too.

71
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:19,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Because on the NES, it had little aliens that would try to eat your ball.

72
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:22,811
[SPEAKER_07]: But the actual pinball machine is just difficult.

73
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:23,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

74
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:25,953
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have a special place in my heart for pinbot.

75
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:26,494
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

76
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:27,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you played this week?

77
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides playing with fire?

78
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I did play with fire because I lit candles on the winter solstice.

79
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:38,405
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to make fire the game.

80
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:44,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's putting out fire the game, the brave firefighters.

81
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, alright.

82
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:48,112
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a year-end award I'd like to see.

83
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:49,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Best use of fire in a game.

84
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:52,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I did... Well, there's also Burning Rangers back in the day.

85
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:53,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I played another game, though.

86
00:04:53,797 --> 00:04:54,117
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

87
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:59,061
[SPEAKER_07]: I did play that Marine Harpoon Sega game because I was at Walmart and I was bored.

88
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:00,602
[SPEAKER_07]: So I played...

89
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:03,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I played the harpoon game.

90
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:04,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And how was that?

91
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:04,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Sucks.

92
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:05,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

93
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:10,210
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been the first time you play it and that's like, this screen has burned in.

94
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:10,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Fix.

95
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:13,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

96
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:14,992
[SPEAKER_03]: How was my gaming week?

97
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:15,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

98
00:05:15,893 --> 00:05:18,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a lot of crappy games, unfortunately.

99
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:21,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Cars on the Wii and it sucked ass.

100
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:22,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought it for Nelly.

101
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:25,798
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, she said she could try it and then she agreed it did suck ass.

102
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:26,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Um.

103
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:54,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I kind of went back on what I said about Ubisoft And I went and bought another Ubisoft game And this only further, you know, proves that their games suck Because I went and bought Monster 4x4 World Circuit Despite the reviews, you know, I said Oh, they're just probably complaining because the graphics look like GameCube graphics And it's not like we've been able to trust any major gaming press review recently anyway Exactly, so, you know

104
00:05:54,804 --> 00:06:01,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought, hey, you know, what the hell, it sounds like it could be like Excite Truck, it's four players, that could be fun.

105
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,171
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

106
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:07,983
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is this piece of shit that you gave me?

107
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:10,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is obviously not a real game.

108
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:14,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done that with a game before.

109
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,311
[SPEAKER_03]: But what game?

110
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:34,589
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the WWF, at the time, Thunder game on PlayStation.

111
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:38,712
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so bad that Dan and I took it back to Blockbuster and had them trade it out.

112
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:44,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I would urge anyone not to even consider this as an alternative to Excite Truck.

113
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,138
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not even close.

114
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, most people don't like Excite Truck either, so they're just like, you know what?

115
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:51,323
[SPEAKER_04]: No racing on the Wii for me.

116
00:06:52,143 --> 00:06:53,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to pick up Need for Speed Carbon?

117
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:54,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it one more shot.

118
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:57,628
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not picking up Need for Speed Carbon.

119
00:06:57,938 --> 00:07:01,579
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're just being carbon, I know what kind of a game it is, and so I know it would be pretty decent.

120
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:09,282
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not the same type of a game as Excite Truck, but Monster Farmer 4 World Circuit, it's slow, doing the tricks is hard.

121
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:12,484
[SPEAKER_04]: But it comes with the LEET steering wheel peripheral.

122
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:15,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, the LEET steering wheel peripheral, that's a piece of shit.

123
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought it into the studio today, okay?

124
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:24,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought it to have Christopher try it out so he can give a review on the next show, but it is awful.

125
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,489
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a really bad game, and I...

126
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:31,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, but they just... So they had six or seven launch games.

127
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:33,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but they all sucked, Ubisoft.

128
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:39,114
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just trying to capitalize on the lack of titles, you know, being out there and hoping people will get to buy this stuff.

129
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:39,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

130
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:47,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure a lot of people bought this stuff, and I don't know, maybe their kids liked it and stuff, but it's just, it's an awful game.

131
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:55,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you play, you know, like Excite Truck or something like that, or Need for Speed Carbon, you're just like, wow, what the hell is this shit?

132
00:07:55,712 --> 00:08:00,553
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I urge you, do not buy this game, because you'll only be disappointed.

133
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:06,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Ubisoft might be able to redeem themselves with some of the later games that are coming out in 2007?

134
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:09,255
[SPEAKER_04]: With, you know, 360, they have some pretty big titles planned, right?

135
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:17,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, 360, they've got Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, which looks okay, but it looks exactly the same as Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 1.

136
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:20,897
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, Warfighter 2, great.

137
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:22,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, I...

138
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:26,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I challenge you to look at the screenshots and be able to tell the two games apart.

139
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:27,830
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't.

140
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,551
[SPEAKER_03]: They look exactly the same.

141
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:31,553
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

142
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:34,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but then again, people like stuff that's the same.

143
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:35,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it should be fine.

144
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:37,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rainbow Six Vegas, I heard, was pretty good.

145
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:38,759
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not my type of game.

146
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:45,145
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I've seen some of the stuff that they're coming out for the Wii, for, you know, say in, um,

147
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:47,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not anything new, let me put it that way.

148
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:55,698
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just ports of old shit that they're tacking the controls on, and they really need to come out and create some new games, and I'm not talking about Red Steel 2.

149
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about a brand new game.

150
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:01,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Does Reggie need to come lay the smack down?

151
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:01,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

152
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:07,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're just looking at numbers, you know, and Red Steel sold really well.

153
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it wasn't that good of a game.

154
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:14,351
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people were looking for another GoldenEye, and it was not GoldenEye.

155
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:16,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, was that it?

156
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,940
[SPEAKER_04]: MyGamingWeek Nothing really new to report for you guys.

157
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:21,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff.

158
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:25,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Every Extend Extra, a little bit of Luminous 2 as well.

159
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:40,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Still playing Burnout on Xbox and I'm getting very frustrated at how bad I suck at Burnout because the achievements, for one of them you have to get all, basically the majority of the achievements are you get all perfect ratings in every difficulty level.

160
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:45,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm one star shy in the very first basic difficulty level.

161
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,461
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one

162
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Freaking Race, I cannot get a gold medal in, and therefore I'm not able to get a perfect.

163
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:55,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's frustrating the hell out of me how badly I suck at Burnout, so I cry a lot.

164
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:59,110
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does give me an opportunity to use custom soundtracks and listen to, you know.

165
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:08,317
[SPEAKER_04]: What's kind of funny is usually I'll put in the soundtrack to Wangan and Midnight Maximum Tune, and I'll play Burnout to that.

166
00:10:08,437 --> 00:10:08,998
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of fun.

167
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:11,199
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yay for custom soundtracks.

168
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, I've been watching Extifer play a lot of Excite Truck.

169
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:25,024
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I'd like to point out, he just finally got, just like as of a few moments ago, got the very last trophy, the Super Duper Rings trophy, and says that nothing else happens, you just get all the trophies, that's it.

170
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:29,946
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's been using the SD card that Jamie got him for Christmas to do all the custom soundtracks there.

171
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:31,987
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs to get all the challenge modes finished, and then...

172
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:34,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that unlocks one other thing that's minor.

173
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,770
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done every single possible thing you can do in race mode.

174
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know anybody besides Nelly that's probably as obsessed with this game as X4 is.

175
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:46,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people wrote off Excite Truck as kind of cheap compared to X4 360 Racers.

176
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:47,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

177
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:48,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it in Dan House.

178
00:10:49,517 --> 00:10:49,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

179
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:58,383
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so interesting because this game kind of got a lot of critical heat against it, but it's really caught on with a lot of folks that I've...

180
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:00,669
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

181
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,792
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of got the same formula, almost.

182
00:11:22,872 --> 00:11:28,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the way that you score points and stuff for doing drifts and, you know... I mean, Sidetrack does have its weaknesses.

183
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Lack of online support being the biggest, you know.

184
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:32,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's just... I know, it's lame.

185
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:33,561
[SPEAKER_03]: That really is lame.

186
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:35,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Lack of four-player racing.

187
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:35,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid.

188
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:37,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

189
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:46,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I really don't understand Nintendo in just saying, Oh, you know, all these other consoles have been online for the last two generations, um...

190
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:50,477
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're just not gonna, we just don't feel it right now.

191
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:51,739
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're stupid.

192
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:53,581
[SPEAKER_03]: You're stupid, stupid, stupid.

193
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,618
[SPEAKER_04]: and I can't help but wonder how Mario Kart's going to do.

194
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:12,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know that's inevitable that we'll get a Mario Kart on the Wii eventually.

195
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hopefully it won't suck.

196
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not until 2008.

197
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it won't suck as bad as Double Dash because Double Dash blew ass.

198
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:21,303
[SPEAKER_04]: But the DS one was pretty rad.

199
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:22,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the most recent one, really.

200
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:25,185
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because it's like Mario Kart 64.

201
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:27,746
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it rocked.

202
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:35,069
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is though is it better have online play because if it doesn't, that's a huge mistake.

203
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:36,029
[SPEAKER_03]: And

204
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:37,135
[SPEAKER_03]: ExciteTrek 2

205
00:12:58,892 --> 00:12:59,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Sort of.

206
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:00,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of.

207
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:00,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I could see that a little bit.

208
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:01,915
[SPEAKER_04]: And sort of the feel of the game.

209
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:02,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I could see that a little bit.

210
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:07,379
[SPEAKER_07]: If they had the multiplayer be, or sort of like how, what was that game?

211
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:11,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh God, I can't remember.

212
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:14,205
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 2099, one of the racing games.

213
00:13:14,385 --> 00:13:18,268
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what Excite... It had the dial-in thing to where you could... You know what Excite Trek reminds me of?

214
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:20,930
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean Rush 2049?

215
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

216
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:24,293
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what Excite Trek reminds me of?

217
00:13:25,073 --> 00:13:25,494
[SPEAKER_04]: A woman.

218
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:28,276
[SPEAKER_06]: How?

219
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,383
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

220
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:00,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else on Excite Trek?

221
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:02,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it was still my gaming week.

222
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:03,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, who cares?

223
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:07,670
[SPEAKER_04]: DS, Final Fantasy 3, which I'm loving more and more, even though it's kind of hard.

224
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,974
[SPEAKER_04]: And I finally got the four-star difficulty in Elite Beat Agents.

225
00:14:12,254 --> 00:14:13,155
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I love that game.

226
00:14:13,876 --> 00:14:14,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.

227
00:14:14,697 --> 00:14:16,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Expect to see that in my top ten for the year.

228
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:17,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you that much.

229
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:19,141
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

230
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into some housekeeping real quick before we get into the news.

231
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:25,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week's show is also going to be pre-taped.

232
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,335
[SPEAKER_04]: We're pre-taped tonight.

233
00:14:26,355 --> 00:14:33,159
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not live, as we mentioned previously, but those of you guys on our audio RSS, also known as podcasting, have a chance to download the program.

234
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,709
[SPEAKER_04]: and so hello folks.

235
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:36,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week is going to be the same deal.

236
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,550
[SPEAKER_04]: However, next week is going to be a special show.

237
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:54,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we're anticipating there's not going to be a lot of news due to the holiday season, what we're going to do is we're going to do sort of a year-end special and we're inviting a lot of our friends as in other podcasters, other shows on OLR, guests that we've had previously on the program and people in the industry.

238
00:14:55,014 --> 00:14:56,214
[SPEAKER_04]: We're inviting a whole

239
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:57,061
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

240
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:31,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we want to mention Dig.com just recently added podcasting to their listing, and we want to thank you guys who've dug us.

241
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:37,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad, considering we haven't really mentioned it on the show or on the front page of the site.

242
00:15:37,148 --> 00:15:41,372
[SPEAKER_04]: We did give it a shout-out on the forums, and I know All Games has really been helping out with that effort as well.

243
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:44,575
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gotten, I don't know, 60-something digs on the podcast.

244
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:45,175
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

245
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:51,401
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you feel like going and supporting that a little more, that would be awesome, because it all helps to spread the word, which, as you know,

246
00:15:51,821 --> 00:16:00,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Independent Radio has to rely on to get the news out there because we don't have no magazine that gives us free two, three page spreads in to promote our product.

247
00:16:00,465 --> 00:16:03,266
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to go on there and vote.

248
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:12,549
[SPEAKER_04]: And isn't it interesting that even that being said that the Corpcast, you know, because they're so out there and so pushed, they end up getting dug the most too.

249
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:14,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they do have employees that can go and dig.

250
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose that's true too.

251
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:16,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

252
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:20,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywho, let's get into some gaming news starting with Loki.

253
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:21,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

254
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:25,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course this week we had two updates to it.

255
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:29,549
[SPEAKER_03]: The forecast channel and the internet channel being added.

256
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:31,950
[SPEAKER_03]: The forecast channel is, well, weather.

257
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was pretty simplistic, but fun to play around with.

258
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:38,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I spun the globe a lot because I was bored.

259
00:16:38,115 --> 00:16:39,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all spun the globe.

260
00:16:40,777 --> 00:16:41,938
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you do with globes.

261
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:45,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when I was in school and I'd find a globe, I'd spin it.

262
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,841
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it.

263
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:49,183
[SPEAKER_04]: We would try to find the funniest city name.

264
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:55,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I would take stickers and paste them all over the globe.

265
00:17:11,337 --> 00:17:13,579
[SPEAKER_03]: So those have been the launch.

266
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:23,888
[SPEAKER_03]: The, of course, internet channel is free until June 2007, or June 30th, 2007, which it'll be pay afterwards, five bucks afterwards.

267
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:26,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, I guess they're considering it a beta.

268
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:28,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it not done?

269
00:17:29,272 --> 00:17:30,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn you, Opera.

270
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:32,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on, finish the fucking thing.

271
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:59,795
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever so they're working the kinks out they'll be updated I'm assuming for free everyone's assuming oh we're all going to have to pay for it in July or whatever I don't think so I think they're just going to update it and so look forward to that and then of course I think in January we're going to be getting the news channel which hopefully we'll have a way to sign up for different RSS feeds and stuff because I don't really give a shit about the world news but

272
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:00,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

273
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:05,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're really trying to turn the Wii into the front page of Yahoo.

274
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:10,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what do you think, though, I mean, about the browser channel?

275
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's pretty good.

276
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:16,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad it does support Flash, because you'll see a lot more from OLRWii.com.

277
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some good plans for that.

278
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:21,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Hurry, hurry.

279
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:25,761
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's good, though, is it's definitely a lot easier to browse than, say, the PSP browser.

280
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:26,422
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.

281
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:29,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering how long it'll be before we actually...

282
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually kind of weird.

283
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:36,648
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit easier to browse than the PS3 browser, too, because apparently their text entry sucks, too.

284
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,710
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm wondering how long it'll be before we see a 360 browser.

285
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, they've got to jump on the bandwagon.

286
00:18:44,493 --> 00:18:46,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

287
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:47,055
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.

288
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:49,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the WiiCade stuff doesn't work too well.

289
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:52,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone was hoping that site would be good, but they have to downgrade all their games for Flash 7.

290
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:53,860
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

291
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I checked some of it out.

292
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

293
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:57,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're pretty fun, some of the games.

294
00:18:58,463 --> 00:18:58,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

295
00:18:59,937 --> 00:19:00,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

296
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:26,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not tiny box, but when you're looking at a big widescreen TV, it doesn't take up a big portion of it.

297
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:32,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of wish there was a way to make that stuff bigger because YouTube's a pretty awesome site to be looking at on the Wii.

298
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:34,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can get everybody in the living room.

299
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:42,338
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I did is I created my own personal page finally on YouTube, and I've started bookmarking videos I really like, like the banana muffin, muffin, muffin, banana.

300
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:44,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Our listeners are going to have no idea what I'm talking about.

301
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,443
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can bookmark these videos and play them for people.

302
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:50,003
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

303
00:19:50,663 --> 00:19:53,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so, yeah, I like the Wii browser as well.

304
00:19:53,524 --> 00:20:03,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to whatever you are able to come up with for olrwii.com, because olrpsp.com, that site's still getting, even though we haven't really done a lot of maintenance on it, it's still getting talked about.

305
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:06,670
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still getting talked about, and, you know, it looks great on the PSP.

306
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,971
[SPEAKER_04]: You did a really good job with that, so hats off to you.

307
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:10,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking forward to seeing what you can do with the Wii.

308
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:12,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

309
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:12,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

310
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:16,034
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't help it.

311
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we're looking forward to seeing what Matt can do with his Wii.

312
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:22,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me talk also about some other Wii news.

313
00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:30,300
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of folks are talking about Virtual Console, and I thought it was quite humorous that people thought Nintendo was going to throw them a free game at Christmas.

314
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.

315
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:40,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard a rumor Sony's doing something similar, but I guess folks thought Nintendo was going to throw them Super Mario Bros., one of their biggest games, as a free game.

316
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:45,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, you know, considering how many times we've had to buy Super Mario Bros.

317
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:48,595
[SPEAKER_04]: and various, like the Game Boy one they had, and the

318
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:51,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Nintendo 1 they had and all that crap.

319
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:54,296
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd think they could give us it for free, but no.

320
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:57,098
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out for 500 Wii Points on Christmas Day.

321
00:20:57,358 --> 00:21:06,644
[SPEAKER_04]: But also coming out, ToeJam & Earl, R-Type for the TurboGrafx-16, and Super Castlevania, which should be pretty awesome.

322
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:07,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Street Fighter 2 also.

323
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:10,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Street Fighter 2 as well, even though I don't really plan on checking that one out.

324
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:11,287
[SPEAKER_03]: R-Type.

325
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:12,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you like R-Type?

326
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:13,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Urban Champion.

327
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:17,551
[SPEAKER_04]: On January 1st, you get Urban Champion and I think it was Baseball.

328
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:21,147
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, Urban Champion kind of sucks.

329
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:31,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people think it might be cool because they haven't really heard of it, but keep in mind, this game was made before Double Dragon, before a lot of that other stuff.

330
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:33,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Urban Champion kind of sucks.

331
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be worth the 500 points, I'm sorry to say.

332
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,210
[SPEAKER_04]: We need bad dudes.

333
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,311
[SPEAKER_04]: New Year's Day is kind of weak, but Christmas Day is very strong in releases.

334
00:21:40,074 --> 00:21:41,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a bad enough dude to save the president?

335
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:43,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad dudes would be awesome.

336
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:44,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they really need.

337
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:46,499
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it sucked on the NES.

338
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:48,401
[SPEAKER_04]: It totally sucked compared to the arcade.

339
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:49,582
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a horrible game, but it was fun.

340
00:21:49,682 --> 00:21:51,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they make bad dudes on Genesis?

341
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:52,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

342
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:52,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

343
00:21:52,785 --> 00:21:53,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

344
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they made it on another system besides just the Nintendo.

345
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:57,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

346
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:01,652
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have those releases to look forward to on Christmas.

347
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:08,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of releases, as... Well, there are...

348
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:12,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Some next week in the UK.

349
00:22:13,252 --> 00:22:14,253
[SPEAKER_07]: And by some, I mean three.

350
00:22:15,353 --> 00:22:17,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, on the 25th, we have Wii Sports.

351
00:22:17,654 --> 00:22:17,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Duh.

352
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:23,956
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 29th, we've got... What the hell retailer is going to be open on the 25th in the UK to sell Wii Sports?

353
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:25,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, whatever, whatever.

354
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:27,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah.

355
00:22:28,637 --> 00:22:34,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also, two PSP releases, Free Running and Lego Star Wars 2, the original trilogy.

356
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,460
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 29th.

357
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:40,581
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes sense, though, that it's a slow week in the UK because of the holiday and everything.

358
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:42,703
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be pretty slow over here, too, right, Loki?

359
00:22:43,183 --> 00:22:45,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's extremely slow.

360
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say there's actually nothing coming out.

361
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:50,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty confident in that.

362
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:53,829
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anything, it was just a crappy-ass DS game.

363
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really mean crappy, like board game collection-type crappy.

364
00:22:58,673 --> 00:23:10,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so, but we do have some exclusive release dates for you, and I'd like to touch on something I was talking about earlier in the show about how websites are carrying exclusive stories that certain games are coming out and that they have the first news on it.

365
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:23,049
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a news piece that's being run by GoNintendo.com, which is actually originally covered on CodenameRevolution.com, talking about High School Musical being in development for the Wii.

366
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,212
[SPEAKER_03]: In case you forgot, we did mention that back in episode 206,

367
00:23:28,914 --> 00:23:33,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Way back in the month of October, and gave you a release date of that as well.

368
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:39,121
[SPEAKER_03]: And in case you haven't heard of that, I believe it's coming out in May.

369
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:40,241
[SPEAKER_04]: But who cares?

370
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:41,922
[SPEAKER_04]: It's High School Musical The Game.

371
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I put this right up there with, like, happy feet.

372
00:23:44,804 --> 00:23:45,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

373
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:46,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a crappy game.

374
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:48,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't you guys just kiss and make up?

375
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:49,667
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really not worth fighting over.

376
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:51,348
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's worth fighting over.

377
00:23:51,689 --> 00:23:52,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's worth fighting.

378
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:58,313
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but seriously, so that's coming out, and, you know, great.

379
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,703
[SPEAKER_03]: We did have a few other things, and some of these were mentioned during the week.

380
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:08,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I had them posted in our show role, but during the week, more news came out, and we had some dates being released.

381
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:16,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Prince of Persia Rival Swords for the Wii being announced by Ubisoft, and that's coming out March 14th.

382
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:23,418
[SPEAKER_03]: What they didn't mention, though, is that Driver Parallel Lines will also be coming out on the Wii and the PSP.

383
00:24:24,318 --> 00:24:26,200
[SPEAKER_03]: That is also the same day on March 14th.

384
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:32,279
[SPEAKER_03]: And a week prior, they're going to be releasing their game for the new Ninja Turtles movie.

385
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:37,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's coming out on PlayStation 2, GameCube, 360, the Wii, the DS, and the Game Boy Advance.

386
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:40,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's coming out on the 7th.

387
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:47,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Also from Ubisoft, we've got a sequel to their really crappy Game Boy Advance game, Dogs.

388
00:24:47,408 --> 00:24:52,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Dogs 2, which is coming out on the 7th of March as well.

389
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:56,753
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a music game coming out at the end of February called Guitar Hits for the PSP.

390
00:24:57,352 --> 00:24:58,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Ball Z, Shin Budokai, Another

391
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:32,405
[SPEAKER_03]: for PSP, the follow-up of their Shin Budokai game, and that's coming out March 14th.

392
00:25:33,185 --> 00:25:49,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Dragon Ball Z Haru Kanaru, that's a very long name, Haru Kanaru Densetsu for the DS, and that's a mouthful right there.

393
00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:52,176
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out on the 21st of March.

394
00:25:52,557 --> 00:25:52,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And then

395
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,330
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna love this.

396
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Elder Scrolls Oblivion for the PlayStation 3.

397
00:25:57,492 --> 00:25:59,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Delayed yet again to the end of February.

398
00:26:00,053 --> 00:26:01,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out now, February 27th.

399
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:03,514
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

400
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:07,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Gee, where have I heard this Oblivion getting delayed for the new console thing before?

401
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:09,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Where have I heard this before?

402
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:10,437
[SPEAKER_04]: 2006, maybe?

403
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:12,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, seriously.

404
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:14,899
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's being delayed yet again.

405
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why they don't have it done yet, but whatever.

406
00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:19,141
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

407
00:26:20,808 --> 00:26:21,169
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

408
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for the exclusive look at some of the U.S.

409
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,111
[SPEAKER_04]: news.

410
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:27,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody else has mentioned that whole Oblivion getting delayed thing, huh?

411
00:26:27,773 --> 00:26:28,413
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

412
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:32,376
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sure a few months from now they'll mention, oh, by the way, it's been delayed.

413
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:37,439
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the exclusive news on it because everyone seems to ignore us.

414
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,260
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

415
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,082
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not a real legitimate site because we don't have game in our title.

416
00:26:41,282 --> 00:26:41,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

417
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:52,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out in Japan, also kind of slim pickings in Japan this week, but you do get the Japanese version of Prey on the 360 this week on December 28th.

418
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:57,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Also on the PlayStation 3, you're going to get Formula 1 Championship Edition coming out there.

419
00:26:58,228 --> 00:27:02,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming to the Nintendo Wii, you get, not a lot, you get a new memory card there.

420
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:10,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming to the PlayStation 2, you get Formula 1 2006, Unimishi, and Himihibi Princess Days.

421
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:12,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that sound like a title you're interested in playing?

422
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:13,316
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

423
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:14,456
[SPEAKER_07]: That actually sounds kind of cute.

424
00:27:14,837 --> 00:27:15,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds kind of cute.

425
00:27:15,697 --> 00:27:26,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming for the Nintendo DS, we have just a bunch of accessories, some pens, some covers, and an Animal Crossing mascot strap, and a carrying bag for Animal Crossing.

426
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:27,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

427
00:27:28,002 --> 00:27:28,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like it might be kind of fun.

428
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:37,287
[SPEAKER_04]: You do get Dragon Quest monsters, though, on the DS, which is, you know, Dragon Quest games are always pretty big deals over there in Japan, even though this is, you know, it's a spin-off game still.

429
00:27:37,707 --> 00:27:38,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Gonna be pretty big.

430
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:41,018
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really all I have.

431
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:42,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whole lot.

432
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,240
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a slow week over there, too.

433
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I was going to say, the High School Musical game, I said May, because I was just completely pulling it out of the top of my head.

434
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:54,326
[SPEAKER_03]: But I looked back in the show role for episode 206, and apparently it was July 11th.

435
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:56,007
[SPEAKER_03]: May was Pirates of the Caribbean 3.

436
00:27:56,628 --> 00:27:57,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it go, Jesus.

437
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:00,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I've got to get my information correct, okay?

438
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in case.

439
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:03,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough, fair enough.

440
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:04,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

441
00:28:05,012 --> 00:28:07,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that we're moving on from our angst, aren't we?

442
00:28:08,106 --> 00:28:09,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so, yeah.

443
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:42,576
[SPEAKER_04]: The best news about this is that I won't have to buy some fucking cable to do it like you had to do on the GameCube.

444
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:47,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, the first cable you could connect to your Advance or whatever, but then it didn't work with the Advance SP.

445
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:48,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, it didn't.

446
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:49,762
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so annoying.

447
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:50,843
[SPEAKER_04]: So annoying.

448
00:28:50,943 --> 00:28:51,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you, Nintendo.

449
00:28:51,723 --> 00:28:52,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still mad at you over that.

450
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,285
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I still held onto my GBA.

451
00:28:54,646 --> 00:29:02,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I have to tell you what I want to see come out again is the Pac-Man Plus or Pac-Man Versus.

452
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:03,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Pac-Man Versus.

453
00:29:03,773 --> 00:29:07,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that would actually be a really fun download title for the Wii, wouldn't it?

454
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:13,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, we still randomly play that game because it's just fantastic.

455
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was such a fun idea.

456
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:25,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, also, I think about, you know, they should really give Four Swords another chance because I think a lot of people didn't get into Four Swords on the GameCube because of the fact you had to have, all these people had to have an advance and all these people had to have the cables.

457
00:29:25,734 --> 00:29:27,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't usually hard to find people with an advance.

458
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:30,996
[SPEAKER_04]: It was hard to find people with the cables to play the game with.

459
00:29:31,156 --> 00:29:32,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing with Crystal Chronicles.

460
00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:35,878
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we actually have two or three sets of cables at my house just because of that.

461
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:38,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you're a nerd.

462
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:42,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, it was just that we ended up, you know, Dan worked at GameStop at the time.

463
00:29:42,593 --> 00:29:43,354
[SPEAKER_07]: We found him cheap.

464
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:45,175
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd just hold on to him.

465
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:50,979
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was really, I think, in that respect, though, it's, hey, we make it require this.

466
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,320
[SPEAKER_07]: We can sell more stuff.

467
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:54,501
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

468
00:29:55,302 --> 00:30:06,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really, really hoping that we get not just, you know, like the one or two ones that were out before, but get a whole series of games that interact between the Wii and the DS.

469
00:30:07,517 --> 00:30:08,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I could really go for that.

470
00:30:08,518 --> 00:30:09,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Any ideas how they could do that, Loki?

471
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:13,821
[SPEAKER_03]: How they could get more games to interact with both systems?

472
00:30:15,242 --> 00:30:26,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, probably just... They'll probably start adding it on kind of like they did with the Game Boy Advance stuff, you know, where, like, remember Metroid Prime, where you could download the original Metroid to it and stuff like that.

473
00:30:27,788 --> 00:30:29,709
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll probably start with gimmicky stuff like that.

474
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:33,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, maybe the new Animal Crossing will allow you to download some games.

475
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:33,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Dream on!

476
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I have an idea.

477
00:30:37,276 --> 00:30:40,579
[SPEAKER_07]: They should be able to turn your Wii into a demo station.

478
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's been a long time rumor.

479
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:46,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember nobody's ever seen if that's really going to happen.

480
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:49,647
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, the rumor was you'd be able to download DS demos through your Wii.

481
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:52,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like you're supposed to be able to do PSP demos through the PS3.

482
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:57,074
[SPEAKER_07]: But if an Animal Crossing were to come out on Wii, that means that we'd probably get the island back.

483
00:30:57,194 --> 00:30:57,855
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be fun.

484
00:30:59,298 --> 00:31:01,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody's waiting for Animal Crossing on the Wii.

485
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:01,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

486
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:06,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little skeptical this time because I was so excited about Animal Crossing on the DS.

487
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so excited about it and then played it for like two weeks and then I was done.

488
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,981
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you should have a Mii game.

489
00:31:11,722 --> 00:31:19,404
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you make your Mii on your Wii and download your Mii to the DS with a little thing like sub-games.

490
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:21,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess anything is possible.

491
00:31:22,345 --> 00:31:22,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything's possible.

492
00:31:23,545 --> 00:31:23,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

493
00:31:24,471 --> 00:31:34,119
[SPEAKER_03]: But one thing that they're probably not going to have in Animal Crossing is the Wiimote throwing game, because they've been getting a lot of heat over the whole Wiimote strap thing.

494
00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:45,508
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, of course, as I predicted last week, immediately the next day, Class Action Lawsuit filed for the stupid Wii strap things, and of course... He's so humble, isn't he?

495
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:51,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I mean, I'm not taking credit for that, because anybody could have guessed that, that's just...

496
00:31:51,513 --> 00:31:52,633
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just stupid.

497
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:56,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, of course it was coming because people were looking to profit from all this stuff.

498
00:31:57,175 --> 00:32:05,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So, some company, Greenwelling LLP, filed a national class action lawsuit on behalf of the owners of Nintendo Wii.

499
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:11,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, them, because, you know, all these Wii owners are in dire need of some money.

500
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:12,442
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you know what?

501
00:32:12,702 --> 00:32:13,722
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't represent me.

502
00:32:14,082 --> 00:32:17,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a Nintendo Wii owner since launch day, and you don't represent me.

503
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:20,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Let that be known on this program.

504
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:26,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so you need to say I represent Wii owners except Rob Pomorin's Lounge Radio.

505
00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:27,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And me.

506
00:32:28,077 --> 00:32:28,277
[SPEAKER_03]: And me.

507
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:30,578
[SPEAKER_07]: You should just say you represent stupid people.

508
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:38,203
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that basically the class action lawsuit rose as a result of the defective nature of the Wii remotes.

509
00:32:39,363 --> 00:32:50,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically saying that the wrist straps were not strong enough to withstand the use of the player and that Nintendo did not include enough

510
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:54,440
[SPEAKER_03]: instruction on how to use the Wii Remote properly.

511
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,080
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

512
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:56,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

513
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to shove a Wii Remote up their butt.

514
00:32:58,063 --> 00:32:58,964
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a retard.

515
00:32:59,184 --> 00:32:59,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

516
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:00,646
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

517
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:01,967
[SPEAKER_07]: That's insulting to retarded people.

518
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:03,548
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just an idiot.

519
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:04,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

520
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't deal with that.

521
00:33:07,412 --> 00:33:17,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And that it's basically, you know, what they're saying, though, and they're looking to do is the class action lawsuit is going to basically correct

522
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:24,632
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to correct the defect in the Wii Remote and provide a refund to the purchase or replace the defective Wii Remotes.

523
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're trying to also claim damages for stuff that people have done.

524
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:35,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help but think, though, that they've sent out emails.

525
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:39,367
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a stupid indicator in the front of all the games.

526
00:33:39,447 --> 00:33:41,448
[SPEAKER_04]: It's built into the games, for God's sake.

527
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:42,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Built into the consoles.

528
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:44,850
[SPEAKER_03]: On every single game, this is the Wii strap thing.

529
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,192
[SPEAKER_03]: They've offered this free replacement program.

530
00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:50,814
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to replace your Wii straps, they'll do it for free.

531
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:52,255
[SPEAKER_03]: They've...

532
00:33:52,887 --> 00:33:59,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Told you in the instruction manuals do not swing wildly, and you don't need to swing wildly, and the commercials don't show them swinging wildly.

533
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:03,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, they show them diving across the couch, but that's not swinging wildly.

534
00:34:03,657 --> 00:34:04,878
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just acting like an idiot.

535
00:34:06,997 --> 00:34:19,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think the best comparison I heard about that, though, was that, like, you know, in a commercial for a new car, they show them driving in the wilderness doing all these stunts, and they always have that little thing, you know, professional driver on closed course, do not attempt, that whole thing, right?

536
00:34:20,343 --> 00:34:23,104
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know that you don't do that with a regular car.

537
00:34:23,524 --> 00:34:24,305
[SPEAKER_04]: You just know that.

538
00:34:24,465 --> 00:34:26,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Common sense tells you that, right?

539
00:34:26,886 --> 00:34:33,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Common sense tells you if you dive across the couch, you're likely to break the couch or a lamp or your Wiimote, but that's the risk you take.

540
00:34:34,189 --> 00:34:35,810
[SPEAKER_07]: It had warnings, right?

541
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:39,173
[SPEAKER_07]: They've made the warnings abundant.

542
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Three words, idiot.

543
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:48,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it just comes down to Nintendo, of course, said this is, you know, without merit that they've done everything.

544
00:34:48,578 --> 00:34:56,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, reinstating what we just said about, you know, the Wii and that they've given way more than enough, you know, precautions and stuff.

545
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:57,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are stupid.

546
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,123
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, you know...

547
00:35:00,636 --> 00:35:09,141
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see lawsuits out there for people throwing baseball bats and hitting somebody with them and them suing the baseball bat company because they're stupid and let go of the bat.

548
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:10,622
[SPEAKER_03]: They know they're not supposed to do that.

549
00:35:11,022 --> 00:35:26,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just like you know you're not supposed to swing the remote like a 90-mile-an-hour fastball, and just because your hands became slippery... Well, you know, if I had a knife and my hands were slippery and I accidentally stabbed someone with the knife, it's my old damn fault, not the knife company, because they made their knives sharp.

550
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:28,151
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

551
00:35:28,607 --> 00:35:35,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really dumb, and I hope to God that they have somebody out there that sees this case and throws it out of court.

552
00:35:37,073 --> 00:35:39,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they say this might go to jury trial, or that's what they want?

553
00:35:39,594 --> 00:35:41,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Is they want a jury trial out of this?

554
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:56,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think the lawsuit was... No, wait, that was the one for the Xbox 360, where they were seeking $5 million for... They haven't really said a number that they're looking to get yet, but from what we've seen so far, the Wii straps breaking has been...

555
00:35:57,754 --> 00:35:59,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Relatively rare.

556
00:35:59,714 --> 00:36:05,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's happened, but people post it on the internet, and so it seems like a bigger problem than it actually is.

557
00:36:06,556 --> 00:36:09,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of these we found out as of last week that are faked.

558
00:36:10,277 --> 00:36:14,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I just see this as just them trying to profit off of it.

559
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:15,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take the fakers to court.

560
00:36:15,998 --> 00:36:17,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo ought to sue all the fakers.

561
00:36:18,418 --> 00:36:19,038
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be funny.

562
00:36:19,598 --> 00:36:20,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that does make sense.

563
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:22,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Technically, it's perjury.

564
00:36:24,175 --> 00:36:24,595
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

565
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:28,699
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically... I say if Nintendo loses money on this, they take those fakers to court.

566
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,260
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be funny.

567
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:31,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Defamation.

568
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:32,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Defamation suit.

569
00:36:34,124 --> 00:36:34,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be funny.

570
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:35,285
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

571
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, real quick, I want to say, though, speaking of lawsuits, did you hear about that?

572
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:49,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this is going to sound completely random, but did you hear about that trillion-dollar lawsuit that the RIAA filed against that Russian MP3 company that was selling all of MP3.com or whatever that site is?

573
00:36:50,606 --> 00:36:51,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you hear about that?

574
00:36:51,186 --> 00:36:52,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like one of the biggest lawsuits ever.

575
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:56,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Trillions of dollars, like $1.6 trillion lawsuit or something like that.

576
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,709
[SPEAKER_03]: There was another study I read.

577
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:11,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember exactly what it was, but it was something that they were saying that these claims, the damages that are being caused by the downloads are a lot, I mean, which is obvious, are a lot less than what these companies are seeking for.

578
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:18,736
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, you know, really the people downloading these MP3s are not really causing that much damage to them.

579
00:37:19,855 --> 00:37:24,697
[SPEAKER_04]: All this news about lawsuits, I don't know about you guys, but news about stupid lawsuits makes me very angry.

580
00:37:24,757 --> 00:37:25,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it make you angry?

581
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:27,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything makes me angry.

582
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:29,198
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what happens when we get angry?

583
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:31,018
[SPEAKER_07]: People die.

584
00:37:39,061 --> 00:37:40,441
[SPEAKER_04]: The FUs of the week time.

585
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:42,562
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what's pissing you off this week?

586
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:47,223
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to mucus and the extreme amounts of it that live in my lungs.

587
00:37:48,419 --> 00:37:49,660
[SPEAKER_07]: and MakeMeSickEveryMorning.

588
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate bronchitis.

589
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it.

590
00:37:56,142 --> 00:37:58,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate you!

591
00:37:59,464 --> 00:38:00,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Kefka?

592
00:38:00,424 --> 00:38:00,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, forget it.

593
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:01,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

594
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:02,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I remember.

595
00:38:03,185 --> 00:38:12,709
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, I'd also like to just offer an F you to, uh, Tower Video for not having any Doctor Who DVDs before they, uh, went out of business.

596
00:38:12,729 --> 00:38:12,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

597
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:14,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

598
00:38:15,206 --> 00:38:28,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pissed off at the lack of Wii games that are out there that are good Wii games because, you know, I'm really, I'm kind of searching for some more stuff to play and I bought a lot of stuff and I have to say about, you know, 60% of it's been crap.

599
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:30,961
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, it's not because, you know...

600
00:38:32,794 --> 00:38:33,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked a crappy game.

601
00:38:34,596 --> 00:38:38,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't you played damn near every launch title now except like Happy Feet and Avatar?

602
00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:45,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I haven't played like any of the, you know, Happy Feet, Avatar, Spongebob, you know, that stuff that's ports off of old games like Ant Bully and stuff.

603
00:38:46,005 --> 00:38:57,915
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've played, you know, quite a bit of everything and a lot of it's really crappy and I'm starting to get a little afraid that, you know, maybe this launch for the Wii wasn't as good as everyone's saying it was because...

604
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

605
00:39:07,626 --> 00:39:09,548
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot better than this stuff.

606
00:39:09,588 --> 00:39:13,431
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, to be fair, the games that were good on Wii were really good.

607
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:14,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, Zelda.

608
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:18,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Excite Truck was pretty damn good, especially for a launch title.

609
00:39:18,675 --> 00:39:20,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Trauma Center, fucking amazing.

610
00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:22,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if you haven't played the DS one.

611
00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:25,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing it's coming down to is because Excite Truck is really good.

612
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:26,942
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, that's awesome.

613
00:39:27,302 --> 00:39:28,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to find another game like this.

614
00:39:29,304 --> 00:39:29,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait.

615
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

616
00:39:51,547 --> 00:39:55,890
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a drought in games, and it's like three games coming out in the next two months.

617
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, they need more than this.

618
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:02,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you expect that there's going to be a drought in January, February for every system?

619
00:40:02,473 --> 00:40:03,994
[SPEAKER_04]: What do the other systems have coming?

620
00:40:04,174 --> 00:40:05,115
[SPEAKER_03]: The other systems?

621
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:08,337
[SPEAKER_03]: 360's got Lost Planet, which is a pretty large title.

622
00:40:09,498 --> 00:40:11,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Battlestation's Midway, which is shit.

623
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:13,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And Fusion Frenzy.

624
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:19,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And then PlayStation 3 doesn't have shit coming out for it, but PlayStation 3 didn't have shit coming out for it at launch either.

625
00:40:20,204 --> 00:40:20,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

626
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:21,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And then PlayStation 2.

627
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:23,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, January, granted, is a slow month.

628
00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:26,817
[SPEAKER_03]: But February does have a lot of stuff coming out for other systems.

629
00:40:26,897 --> 00:40:27,738
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of big titles.

630
00:40:28,478 --> 00:40:30,759
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Wii is just kind of being skipped.

631
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:31,900
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

632
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:43,181
[SPEAKER_04]: My FUs of the week, I don't really have a lot, so FU to cookies for being so tempting and straying me from my diet this holiday season.

633
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:48,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've gotten so many yummy cookies, like, you know, Loki and Nelly made me some for Christmas that were very good.

634
00:40:48,983 --> 00:40:51,284
[SPEAKER_04]: No offense, I mean, the cookies were great, it's just too tempting.

635
00:40:51,604 --> 00:40:57,106
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some of my students at work made me cookies, and oh gosh, it's too much, too much to handle.

636
00:40:58,986 --> 00:41:00,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back into some news.

637
00:41:01,808 --> 00:41:08,009
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny that you brought this up, but it was talked about this week, the whole delays for Wii games.

638
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:15,091
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some news going on that Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime could possibly be delayed all the way to Christmas.

639
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:24,553
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, of course, Reggie Fils-Aimé discussed with Newsweek not that long ago, he made a promise, Nintendo would not have the launch problems they have with usual consoles.

640
00:41:24,913 --> 00:41:30,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, Metroid Prime 3 which is a from the ground up creation of Metroid for the Wii system will come out in early 2007.

641
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:37,865
[SPEAKER_04]: This gives us fantastic momentum coming off the launch and will certainly be an example of how there will be no new game drought for this system.

642
00:41:38,345 --> 00:41:46,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Another from the ground up Wii game that we are strategically timing to launch to make sure we are continuing driving momentum through 2007 is Super Mario Galaxy.

643
00:41:46,813 --> 00:41:51,055
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and they really are doing a good job keeping games coming out.

644
00:41:51,195 --> 00:42:04,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo is, you know, because they've got WarioWare for January, We Play for February, Mario Party 8 for March, I mean, and that's already, you know, the first quarter of the year, and they've got a game coming out every month.

645
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't say the same for other companies, though, because... So it's the third parties that have to pick it up.

646
00:42:09,682 --> 00:42:11,103
[SPEAKER_03]: But is it still kind of new, maybe?

647
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:12,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

648
00:42:12,815 --> 00:42:15,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And third parties have their development cycles, you know.

649
00:42:15,677 --> 00:42:17,277
[SPEAKER_03]: March, you're going to see a ton of games come out.

650
00:42:17,337 --> 00:42:21,539
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember how Nintendo wasn't letting a lot of them online at first?

651
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,199
[SPEAKER_04]: That's stupid.

652
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:23,240
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be part of it, too.

653
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo needs to fucking get a clue.

654
00:42:26,101 --> 00:42:27,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Online's where it is now.

655
00:42:27,822 --> 00:42:28,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

656
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,783
[SPEAKER_03]: People were really excited about the online for the DS.

657
00:42:30,823 --> 00:42:32,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, okay, because they saw that.

658
00:42:33,456 --> 00:42:35,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take that as an example.

659
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:36,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Get this fucking console online.

660
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,524
[SPEAKER_03]: This Mii Channel, exchanging Miis and exchanging messages shit, it's old.

661
00:42:44,105 --> 00:42:44,825
[SPEAKER_03]: It's old already.

662
00:42:45,826 --> 00:42:48,068
[SPEAKER_03]: We need some more online games.

663
00:42:48,396 --> 00:42:50,138
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs some actual good support for the online.

664
00:43:06,468 --> 00:43:10,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Metroid at some point, Super Mario World on Super Nintendo.

665
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:15,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Those types of games will be strategically planned for when there's a drought of big Wii games.

666
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:15,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

667
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,614
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you need to do with those virtual console games?

668
00:43:17,834 --> 00:43:21,196
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to put them online like they do with Xbox Live Arcade games.

669
00:43:21,536 --> 00:43:23,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Put them so that you can play multiplayer online.

670
00:43:23,677 --> 00:43:30,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not exactly is how they're doing it because the Xbox Live Arcade games have had a little bit of problems with some of the online components of them, but

671
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:33,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Multiplayer Online with Mario Kart.

672
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's going to be awesome.

673
00:43:35,345 --> 00:43:39,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they probably wouldn't want to compete with their new Mario Kart whenever the fuck that's coming out.

674
00:43:40,206 --> 00:43:46,909
[SPEAKER_04]: You could really add a lot of oomph to some of these old crap titles like Baseball, Tennis, Mario Brothers.

675
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:47,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I shouldn't say it's crap.

676
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:49,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they all contributed to history.

677
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Leaderboards, at least.

678
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:57,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you could really add a lot of oomph to these games and really justify the $5 price with these little enhancements.

679
00:43:58,353 --> 00:43:59,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.

680
00:43:59,313 --> 00:44:00,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not asking that much.

681
00:44:00,494 --> 00:44:00,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean,

682
00:44:02,132 --> 00:44:08,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I'm sure there's a huge technical aspect when it comes to lag and all that stuff, but, you know, whatever.

683
00:44:08,944 --> 00:44:12,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Well... Excuse me for a moment while my voice fills me.

684
00:44:13,712 --> 00:44:13,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

685
00:44:14,637 --> 00:44:19,961
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a few rumors floating about, and one that I know a lot of people would really, really like to see.

686
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:31,991
[SPEAKER_07]: There are talks actually from EGM in the January issue stating that Katamari Damacy would be coming out on the Wii and Xbox Live Arcade.

687
00:44:33,292 --> 00:44:37,515
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sort of not sure how it would work on the Wii, if you'd do it like Monkey Ball.

688
00:44:38,056 --> 00:44:38,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably like Monkey Ball.

689
00:44:38,996 --> 00:44:40,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

690
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:43,300
[SPEAKER_07]: But Xbox Live, though, it would definitely...

691
00:44:44,231 --> 00:44:45,872
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good idea, I think, for Xbox Live.

692
00:44:46,113 --> 00:44:49,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm worried about the size limitation on Xbox Live, though, with 50 megs.

693
00:44:49,615 --> 00:44:51,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess the graphics ain't all that.

694
00:44:52,137 --> 00:44:52,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, okay.

695
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:58,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I loaded my copy onto my HD loader, and it wasn't that big.

696
00:44:59,703 --> 00:45:00,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to check it again.

697
00:45:00,624 --> 00:45:07,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm hearing the rumors that they're going to up the live limit because the new memory card's coming out, the 256 megs.

698
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:11,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the 50 meg limit's stupid anyways, and to be honest, I...

699
00:45:12,288 --> 00:45:15,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't download a live arcade game to your memory card.

700
00:45:15,531 --> 00:45:17,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo fucking hoo.

701
00:45:17,152 --> 00:45:17,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

702
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:19,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a goddamn hard drive.

703
00:45:19,453 --> 00:45:20,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Or don't use that part of it.

704
00:45:20,494 --> 00:45:23,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Just use your fucking memory card for saves, and that is it.

705
00:45:24,197 --> 00:45:25,038
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't even do that.

706
00:45:25,078 --> 00:45:25,878
[SPEAKER_07]: We just use a hard drive.

707
00:45:25,898 --> 00:45:31,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the only thing I use memory cards for, downloading content from kiosks, and I don't even do that anymore.

708
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't We Heart Katamari have a two-player mode?

709
00:45:33,104 --> 00:45:33,684
[SPEAKER_04]: It did, didn't it?

710
00:45:33,724 --> 00:45:33,964
[SPEAKER_04]: It did.

711
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:35,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so could you imagine having that on the Xbox?

712
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:36,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Add cooperative and versus.

713
00:45:36,626 --> 00:45:38,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the... The original one did too.

714
00:45:38,428 --> 00:45:39,328
[SPEAKER_04]: The originals did too.

715
00:45:39,348 --> 00:45:39,909
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

716
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:41,270
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of a...

717
00:45:42,622 --> 00:45:44,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I like co-op mode better for Katamari.

718
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:55,904
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't, you know, it wasn't like, you know, it's no Halo, Gears of War style multiplayer that, you know, keeps people coming back, but it's a nice addition, you know, makes it a little something special.

719
00:45:56,744 --> 00:45:58,125
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be kind of fun on Xbox Live.

720
00:45:58,285 --> 00:46:02,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to see, you know... I'd much rather play Katamari and Mashi co-op than Gears of War, I'm sorry.

721
00:46:02,345 --> 00:46:08,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see the Wii version have your Miis as, like, the little, you know, characters running around in the levels and stuff.

722
00:46:08,546 --> 00:46:09,107
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be funny.

723
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, getting to roll over your friends?

724
00:46:10,907 --> 00:46:11,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

725
00:46:11,147 --> 00:46:11,567
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be fun.

726
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:13,200
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be really cool.

727
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:17,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they should do like a... Or the massive people in your Mii parade.

728
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:25,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they should do like a convert an existing Mii into a little prince cousin.

729
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,170
[SPEAKER_04]: A little prince face.

730
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:26,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

731
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:28,752
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be fun.

732
00:46:29,212 --> 00:46:30,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be good.

733
00:46:30,433 --> 00:46:32,014
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a lot of things that they can do with that.

734
00:46:32,134 --> 00:46:34,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully they'll actually use all that.

735
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:36,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, Loki will be all about the achievements.

736
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:37,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that shit.

737
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:39,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it will be all about the achievements.

738
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:41,962
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but anyways.

739
00:46:42,461 --> 00:46:53,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of the 360, the 360 owners got a pretty cool surprise recently as Microsoft has upped their warranty from 90 days to one whole year.

740
00:46:54,750 --> 00:47:02,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So if your console happens to be broken, or if it was broken, you're going to be getting a refund for your broken console.

741
00:47:02,115 --> 00:47:03,495
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is pretty awesome.

742
00:47:04,216 --> 00:47:10,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And definitely, at least they're supporting their hardware with the issues that they may have for it.

743
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:11,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

744
00:47:11,977 --> 00:47:12,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Go Microsoft!

745
00:47:35,737 --> 00:47:44,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this song, of course, is in Luminous 2 on the PSP, and it was just released for download on iTunes this week, so you can check that out by the Genki Rockets.

746
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:45,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Heavenly Star

747
00:48:13,366 --> 00:48:16,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like this song, ever since the video was posted back in the day.

748
00:48:41,232 --> 00:48:41,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

749
00:49:06,189 --> 00:49:10,233
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Black Eyed Peas, Pump It song and Missy Elliott, Lose Control.

750
00:49:10,253 --> 00:49:12,535
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great one to play Luminous to.

751
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:12,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

752
00:49:13,015 --> 00:49:14,716
[SPEAKER_04]: They had some pretty fun choices.

753
00:49:14,796 --> 00:49:17,319
[SPEAKER_07]: For the benefit of our listeners, I'm staring blankly at Rob.

754
00:49:17,479 --> 00:49:17,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

755
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Then go to the next story.

756
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:20,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't listen to any of that.

757
00:49:21,402 --> 00:49:22,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to the next story.

758
00:49:23,144 --> 00:49:29,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know how we were saying that Metal Gear, not just we, I mean a bunch of people were saying Metal Gear Solid 4 was going to be multi-platform?

759
00:49:30,129 --> 00:49:31,110
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a rumor last week.

760
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:31,411
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a rumor.

761
00:49:31,431 --> 00:49:31,871
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a rumor.

762
00:49:32,863 --> 00:49:39,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, an inside source at Konami is not really that reliable.

763
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:46,626
[SPEAKER_07]: They've come out saying that it's going to be definitely exclusive for PS3.

764
00:49:46,846 --> 00:49:50,987
[SPEAKER_03]: At this time is the key word, or words I should say.

765
00:49:52,187 --> 00:49:53,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So they left themselves an out.

766
00:49:53,947 --> 00:49:54,768
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at this time.

767
00:49:54,868 --> 00:49:56,648
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like they said, you know, what was it...

768
00:49:58,067 --> 00:50:05,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Back when, well, when I pointed out when they brought, you know, their version of the story that Splinter Cell was coming out on the PS3 as well.

769
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:11,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they said, oh, we had no plans of this coming out on the PlayStation 3 at this time.

770
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:14,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And then next week they announced, oh, it's coming out on the PlayStation 3.

771
00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:15,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, it wasn't that.

772
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:16,460
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, um...

773
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:19,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Virtual Fighter V, that's what it was.

774
00:50:20,553 --> 00:50:28,117
[SPEAKER_03]: They were doing an interview for that, and that was a PlayStation 3 exclusive, and then this week, you know, 360, so... I'm going to say something uncharacteristic for me.

775
00:50:28,978 --> 00:50:31,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really think any other system can do the game justice but PS3.

776
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

777
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:33,981
[SPEAKER_04]: What makes you say that?

778
00:50:34,261 --> 00:50:35,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Playing Resistance Fall of Man.

779
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:38,284
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think they could do it on 360?

780
00:50:38,324 --> 00:50:39,405
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?

781
00:50:39,605 --> 00:50:42,247
[SPEAKER_07]: They could do it, but it would not do it justice.

782
00:50:42,387 --> 00:50:42,467
[SPEAKER_07]: It...

783
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:49,105
[SPEAKER_07]: With everything that I've seen that they want to do with Metal Gear Solid 4, they're going to need the extra processing power.

784
00:50:49,765 --> 00:50:51,186
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really going to need it.

785
00:50:53,226 --> 00:51:03,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I've played a bunch of stuff on Xbox 360 and it all comes out really pretty, but I honestly, just doing comparisons for several of the games, I think the PS3 is going to be the better platform for the game anyway.

786
00:51:03,971 --> 00:51:05,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee you this will be out on the 360.

787
00:51:07,093 --> 00:51:09,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Not day and date, but it will be out on the 360.

788
00:51:11,229 --> 00:51:12,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have it on PS3.

789
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:12,970
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

790
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:13,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

791
00:51:15,311 --> 00:51:18,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I never really got into Metal Gear past the old NES ones.

792
00:51:18,573 --> 00:51:19,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

793
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:20,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I somehow missed that boat.

794
00:51:20,795 --> 00:51:22,556
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I'm weird for missing it.

795
00:51:22,576 --> 00:51:24,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, do you believe that love can bloom on a battlefield?

796
00:51:24,477 --> 00:51:24,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

797
00:51:24,997 --> 00:51:27,439
[SPEAKER_03]: They basically, it's all about money.

798
00:51:27,579 --> 00:51:28,119
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is.

799
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,221
[SPEAKER_03]: The PlayStation 3 has 200,000 units out there.

800
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Or say, okay, by the end of...

801
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:37,607
[SPEAKER_04]: What if the PS3 suddenly takes off between this and Final Fantasy XIII?

802
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:04,126
[SPEAKER_03]: and it will be made on the 360.

803
00:52:05,326 --> 00:52:14,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because they're, you know, exclusive right now, you know, they do, Sony does pay them for exclusive rights to some of these games and so it, after a certain amount of time.

804
00:52:14,608 --> 00:52:19,409
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but, but, the Xbox 360 does not have six axis.

805
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and the PlayStation 3 doesn't have rumble.

806
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:28,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Such flimsy controllers.

807
00:52:29,351 --> 00:52:31,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so, you know, great.

808
00:52:32,712 --> 00:52:32,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

809
00:52:34,326 --> 00:52:41,269
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of the PlayStation 3, somebody's actually in talks with Amazon for their movie download service.

810
00:52:41,989 --> 00:52:47,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, because PlayStation 3, they're starting to kind of get into the more, you know, downloads and everything.

811
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:55,395
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to admit, they do have some pretty good stuff on their network service right now as far as, you know, like the equivalence to live arcade games.

812
00:52:55,496 --> 00:53:00,098
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, especially they're getting that Gran Turismo HD demo, which is not bad for free.

813
00:53:01,158 --> 00:53:02,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to admit, that's pretty cool.

814
00:53:02,939 --> 00:53:03,119
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

815
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:13,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're talking about going the same way as the 360 and offering movie downloads, which this isn't a big surprise because it's Sony and they want it to be this media center type thing.

816
00:53:14,026 --> 00:53:21,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course they're talking with Amazon because they have their digital download service as well and probably going to hook up with them on that.

817
00:53:23,149 --> 00:53:26,591
[SPEAKER_03]: But I see this probably happening, especially with the PSP.

818
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:28,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they have their download service as well.

819
00:53:29,992 --> 00:53:31,953
[SPEAKER_04]: So what does this mean for UMDs?

820
00:53:32,947 --> 00:53:34,228
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't mean anything for UMDs.

821
00:53:34,288 --> 00:53:37,210
[SPEAKER_03]: It means that people are going to be downloading videos to the PlayStation 3.

822
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:42,894
[SPEAKER_03]: UMDs are going to be like UMDs, meaning they're going to be out there, but they're not going to sell.

823
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:46,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this to compete with 360's new little marketplace movie thingy?

824
00:53:47,097 --> 00:53:47,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

825
00:53:47,518 --> 00:53:49,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I still don't like because they don't have enough HD movies.

826
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:51,500
[SPEAKER_04]: They have like five.

827
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I count five or six HD movies.

828
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:53,402
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

829
00:53:53,882 --> 00:53:58,806
[SPEAKER_03]: It's literally going to be to compete with that, and it's also going to be to compete with iTunes.

830
00:53:59,506 --> 00:54:00,727
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what it's for.

831
00:54:00,747 --> 00:54:01,908
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

832
00:54:02,589 --> 00:54:05,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, something else to be competitive in the movie world.

833
00:54:05,772 --> 00:54:12,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Ken Kutaragi has spoken with Impress, that's a magazine over in Japan, about an AV-centric PlayStation 3.

834
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:24,807
[SPEAKER_04]: This would have the cell processor powering and would, quote, be a standard AV component-sized box with a more powerful power supply unit, anti-shake insulator, and twice the main memory.

835
00:54:25,067 --> 00:54:29,311
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it also goes on to talk about dual HDMI output for this high-end system.

836
00:54:29,651 --> 00:54:37,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is kind of similar to the PSX, which was a version of the PlayStation 2, but it was just very expensive.

837
00:54:37,394 --> 00:54:43,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you can kind of compare it to, you know, like the Panasonic Q was like an AV machine, but it also played GameCube games.

838
00:54:43,856 --> 00:54:47,457
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not necessarily that he's talking about, you know, replacing the PlayStation 3 already.

839
00:54:48,037 --> 00:54:50,578
[SPEAKER_04]: But to me, it does seem a little early to be talking about this.

840
00:54:50,918 --> 00:54:51,178
[SPEAKER_04]: To me.

841
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:54,979
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also... It's like, make your PlayStation 3s.

842
00:54:55,419 --> 00:54:59,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the dual HDMI out, that was originally what they were talking about for the original PlayStation 3.

843
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, apparently, that was a little crazy.

844
00:55:03,162 --> 00:55:10,064
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the same with... Well, actually, I remember the dual HDMI out for the PlayStation 3 was for multiple monitors.

845
00:55:10,084 --> 00:55:13,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, they said that if you had two HDTVs, who would have this?

846
00:55:14,065 --> 00:55:19,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Sitting next to each other, you could extend your desktop to be on both of them for...

847
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:21,353
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

848
00:55:48,414 --> 00:55:51,316
[SPEAKER_03]: and buy a PlayStation 3 and still do it cheaper than this.

849
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:53,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just stupid.

850
00:55:53,997 --> 00:55:57,239
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing, too, they're saying normal component size.

851
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:01,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that PlayStation 3 is not small by any means.

852
00:56:01,222 --> 00:56:04,103
[SPEAKER_03]: It is already normal component size, if not larger.

853
00:56:04,644 --> 00:56:08,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so what's the size of this power brick thing going to be?

854
00:56:08,826 --> 00:56:10,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is it going to be the size of, like,

855
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:12,182
[SPEAKER_03]: A TV or something?

856
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, what are they talking about for this stuff?

857
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:16,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is still a ways out, whatever it is.

858
00:56:17,064 --> 00:56:19,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they need to shut him up, is what they need to do.

859
00:56:19,866 --> 00:56:24,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he's just spouting off retardedness as time goes on.

860
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:27,810
[SPEAKER_03]: He really, he doesn't have a grip on reality.

861
00:56:28,091 --> 00:56:30,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we issued a challenge to our listeners last week.

862
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:36,715
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think the Sony spokespeople have no clue what they're doing in the marketing department, create your own Sony ad.

863
00:56:36,755 --> 00:56:39,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And we invited folks to leave us a voicemail on our Skype line.

864
00:56:39,755 --> 00:56:41,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Sony's new spokesperson, Paradox Vincent.

865
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:41,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Now look,

866
00:57:08,254 --> 00:57:14,297
[SPEAKER_01]: The PS3's been getting a lot of rap, but I think that it's really just all miscommunication, you know?

867
00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:20,841
[SPEAKER_01]: You gamer people just don't understand the way the business works, so I'm here to clear some things up.

868
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:24,103
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest complaint we've heard is the price.

869
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:27,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Too cheap, I know, but there's nothing we can do about that now.

870
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:30,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, some people say it freezes.

871
00:57:31,387 --> 00:57:35,389
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting freezing technology in, so that people can really get a feel

872
00:57:35,899 --> 00:57:39,540
[SPEAKER_01]: for the true next generation look and feel on your 1080i television.

873
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:47,442
[SPEAKER_01]: To really feel like you're driving that car, like you're shooting that alien, or how you're in that giant robot.

874
00:57:48,223 --> 00:57:52,304
[SPEAKER_01]: We want you to feel like you're a ninja or whatever, stabbing the giant enemy crab.

875
00:57:52,924 --> 00:57:53,824
[SPEAKER_01]: We get it, you know?

876
00:57:54,444 --> 00:57:58,185
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand that some people might not have HDTV.

877
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:02,347
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, a great number of people don't have HDTV.

878
00:58:04,204 --> 00:58:06,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially not 1080i HDTV.

879
00:58:07,305 --> 00:58:07,926
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't care.

880
00:58:08,386 --> 00:58:09,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave us alone.

881
00:58:09,606 --> 00:58:10,547
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not hearing you.

882
00:58:11,027 --> 00:58:12,368
[SPEAKER_01]: La la, la la la la la.

883
00:58:13,528 --> 00:58:15,229
[SPEAKER_01]: La la, you're stupid.

884
00:58:16,209 --> 00:58:18,470
[SPEAKER_01]: All in all, it's the perfect gaming console.

885
00:58:18,951 --> 00:58:19,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

886
00:58:20,051 --> 00:58:21,232
[SPEAKER_01]: The Wii's a pedophile.

887
00:58:21,692 --> 00:58:24,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Xbox 360 takes pictures of you while you're sleeping.

888
00:58:25,493 --> 00:58:27,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you pay $600 for a pedophile?

889
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:29,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a pervert?

890
00:58:29,755 --> 00:58:30,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a terrorist?

891
00:58:31,516 --> 00:58:31,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't.

892
00:58:32,817 --> 00:58:33,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Make the right move.

893
00:58:34,707 --> 00:58:35,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Make the Sony move.

894
00:58:50,422 --> 00:58:51,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, Paradox Vincent.

895
00:58:51,383 --> 00:58:54,705
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to send you some random things from our OLR prize pool.

896
00:58:55,025 --> 00:58:57,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have a DDR Extreme 2 bundle.

897
00:58:57,927 --> 00:58:58,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's Extreme 2.

898
00:58:59,008 --> 00:58:59,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That's last year's game.

899
00:58:59,948 --> 00:59:05,332
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, those DDR pads are not easy to come by, so you get a bundle there and some other stuff as well.

900
00:59:05,352 --> 00:59:07,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a DS game we have to give away, too.

901
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:09,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't we have a copy of Tau or something that's got to get given away at some point?

902
00:59:10,015 --> 00:59:10,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

903
00:59:10,555 --> 00:59:11,336
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to see what's in the box.

904
00:59:11,356 --> 00:59:11,816
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see.

905
00:59:12,357 --> 00:59:13,677
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll find out what you get when you get it.

906
00:59:14,078 --> 00:59:14,378
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

907
00:59:15,479 --> 00:59:16,499
[SPEAKER_04]: What a great contest.

908
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,801
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to win something.

909
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:18,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

910
00:59:20,576 --> 00:59:23,619
[SPEAKER_04]: A thing, a random... Think of it as Santa Claus coming to your house.

911
00:59:23,739 --> 00:59:24,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Something's better than nothing.

912
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Something random from Orange Lounge Radio.

913
00:59:26,602 --> 00:59:27,243
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be in touch.

914
00:59:27,743 --> 00:59:29,405
[SPEAKER_07]: You win stuff here.

915
00:59:29,745 --> 00:59:31,006
[SPEAKER_04]: More contests to come.

916
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:34,089
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll probably do something next week, so stay tuned to Orange Lounge Radio.

917
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:36,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I have some news, and this makes me happy.

918
00:59:38,073 --> 00:59:39,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember Loco Roco?

919
00:59:39,774 --> 00:59:40,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Why, yes, I do.

920
00:59:40,695 --> 00:59:41,476
[SPEAKER_07]: It's getting a sequel.

921
00:59:42,737 --> 00:59:43,458
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of a given.

922
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:47,814
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean one of the only PSP games people talked about a lot this year?

923
00:59:48,094 --> 00:59:48,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting a sequel?

924
00:59:49,154 --> 00:59:49,774
[SPEAKER_04]: No way!

925
00:59:49,834 --> 00:59:54,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it was announced by Phil Harrison to MTV News.

926
00:59:54,375 --> 01:00:05,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this makes me think, though, that quite possibly, I don't know, given that LocoRoco sort of flopped in Japan, I'm wondering if they're going to have a more limited release there than they will here.

927
01:00:06,197 --> 01:00:08,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just hear, I can see the interview now.

928
01:00:08,637 --> 01:00:10,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're doing a sequel to LocoRoco.

929
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like any of those Mexican games.

930
01:00:15,421 --> 01:00:16,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamey sees a penis in everything.

931
01:00:16,562 --> 01:00:17,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not.

932
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you wish you were in Second Life this week.

933
01:00:42,864 --> 01:00:50,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we didn't get around to that story, but there was some chick that was being interviewed in Second Life, and all these penises flew by on the screen like people threw dicks at her.

934
01:00:53,147 --> 01:00:54,848
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was thinking, hmm, Jamie should see this.

935
01:00:55,268 --> 01:01:00,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually tried downloading Second Life, because, again, it was my fandom that inspired me.

936
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:03,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone freaking made a TARDIS on Second Life.

937
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:04,831
[SPEAKER_04]: You nerd.

938
01:01:05,191 --> 01:01:15,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not fully extra-dimensional like the actual one, but they had it all laid out, and they had the current one, and then they had the Tom Baker-era one in the different rooms and stuff.

939
01:01:15,173 --> 01:01:15,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was cool.

940
01:01:16,354 --> 01:01:20,975
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I played Second Life for five minutes, and then I was like, this game sucks.

941
01:01:23,235 --> 01:01:23,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

942
01:01:24,656 --> 01:01:28,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Second Life, I don't get it.

943
01:01:29,797 --> 01:01:30,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

944
01:01:31,377 --> 01:01:32,137
[SPEAKER_03]: New Kingdom Hearts.

945
01:01:32,738 --> 01:01:33,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Jamie fandom.

946
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:34,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

947
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:38,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure this is news to everybody.

948
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:41,419
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making another Kingdom Hearts game.

949
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,800
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a shocker.

950
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:44,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Shocker.

951
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:45,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

952
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they do something like this?

953
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:50,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like the last game sold millions or anything.

954
01:01:50,922 --> 01:01:53,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, they're making a new Kingdom Hearts game, Kingdom Hearts 3.

955
01:01:55,043 --> 01:02:06,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, this was sort of announced on the trailer that they had for Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix during their Jump Festa show in Tokyo.

956
01:02:07,169 --> 01:02:09,690
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically saying that a new project was in the works.

957
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:13,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Kingdom Hearts 3, something brand new to the series.

958
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:16,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, something Kingdom Hearts-ish is coming.

959
01:02:16,932 --> 01:02:17,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

960
01:02:17,792 --> 01:02:19,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

961
01:02:19,712 --> 01:02:21,133
[SPEAKER_07]: They better have Space Paranoids in it.

962
01:02:21,473 --> 01:02:25,894
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm here to announce something else that Square is going to be doing.

963
01:02:26,474 --> 01:02:28,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this is going to be a shock to everyone.

964
01:02:28,815 --> 01:02:31,915
[SPEAKER_03]: After Final Fantasy XIII, there will be a Final Fantasy XIV.

965
01:02:32,016 --> 01:02:32,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god!

966
01:02:32,476 --> 01:02:33,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming.

967
01:02:33,276 --> 01:02:33,776
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming.

968
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:43,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I speculate there will be five versions of it.

969
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:53,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I am actually thinking, let me think, there will be another Final Fantasy game re-released on some handheld in the near future.

970
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:57,951
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be some type of re-release of some game from Square Enix's catalog.

971
01:02:57,971 --> 01:03:01,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be another Final Fantasy VII side story.

972
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:04,632
[SPEAKER_03]: After Super Mario Galaxy, there will be another Mario game.

973
01:03:04,732 --> 01:03:05,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

974
01:03:05,232 --> 01:03:06,713
[SPEAKER_04]: And there will be another Zelda game.

975
01:03:06,733 --> 01:03:08,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we actually already know about the Zelda game.

976
01:03:08,913 --> 01:03:11,454
[SPEAKER_04]: But there will be a Metroid 4 in some capacity.

977
01:03:11,514 --> 01:03:13,094
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be another Metroid game as well.

978
01:03:13,114 --> 01:03:17,135
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they will also re-release a remade version of the old Metroid.

979
01:03:17,635 --> 01:03:23,296
[SPEAKER_04]: And despite what the rumors say, if you think they're not going to make a Halo 4 or some type of Halo story, you're kidding yourself.

980
01:03:24,042 --> 01:03:36,252
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway, speaking of games that are going to be kind of expensive, as all those games are going to be, there was an interesting story run by Forbes this week that breaks down the price of a $60 video game.

981
01:03:36,473 --> 01:03:39,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, a lot of people are bitching and moaning because games are $60 now.

982
01:03:39,655 --> 01:03:42,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've heard, but games are kind of expensive in this day and age.

983
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:46,141
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where your money goes.

984
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:48,563
[SPEAKER_04]: $27 goes towards the making of the game.

985
01:03:50,023 --> 01:03:52,624
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 goes towards art and graphics.

986
01:03:53,024 --> 01:03:55,205
[SPEAKER_04]: $12 goes towards gameplay mechanics.

987
01:03:56,105 --> 01:04:04,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, $12 goes to the retail markup, meaning that the store you actually buy it from gets $12, because it usually costs them about $48.

988
01:04:04,987 --> 01:04:07,268
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a console owner fee of $7.

989
01:04:09,674 --> 01:04:15,039
[SPEAKER_04]: and the retail and publishing parties involved only really get about $1 for every game sold.

990
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:23,709
[SPEAKER_04]: They might be able to push it to $3 a game if they sell advertising in the manual or do some of that in-game advertising stuff or what have you.

991
01:04:26,332 --> 01:04:26,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

992
01:04:28,674 --> 01:04:30,276
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where your money goes if you ever wondered.

993
01:04:30,515 --> 01:04:31,516
[SPEAKER_07]: That's economics for you.

994
01:04:31,776 --> 01:04:45,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you ever wonder where your emails go when you send them to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, they go to the bowels of hell known as Jamie's house, where she opens them up and reads them and finds some of her favorites to read for you all on air.

995
01:04:46,328 --> 01:04:48,250
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you have some mail for us this week, DarkSakura?

996
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:48,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

997
01:04:55,069 --> 01:04:57,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn you people, only five this week.

998
01:04:57,131 --> 01:04:57,971
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up with that?

999
01:04:58,652 --> 01:05:00,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I expect better of our listeners.

1000
01:05:00,433 --> 01:05:02,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard there was a holiday or something going on.

1001
01:05:03,415 --> 01:05:03,796
[SPEAKER_07]: So?

1002
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:06,097
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't take long to type.

1003
01:05:06,638 --> 01:05:07,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I type 90 words a minute.

1004
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I can have a letter typed up in, you know, three minutes.

1005
01:05:12,022 --> 01:05:12,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1006
01:05:13,343 --> 01:05:15,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, but we got some pretty good emails.

1007
01:05:16,005 --> 01:05:18,847
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one comes from, I guess it's pronounced Igor.

1008
01:05:20,028 --> 01:05:21,549
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Igor, regular listener from...

1009
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:42,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Florianopolis Brazil that's cool I've been listening to you for quite some time and I consider it a very good podcast top 5 on my iTunes every week by the way I believe that you should be experiencing some problems in iTunes and a stupid thing popped up sorry I had my DVD pop up and then I closed my case while it was reading so it covered email

1010
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:51,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um, okay, um, this is not the first time this happened, at least twice in the last month because I downloaded Part A and it is only eight minutes long.

1011
01:05:51,816 --> 01:05:53,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anyone also have this issue?

1012
01:05:53,578 --> 01:05:54,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep doing a great job.

1013
01:05:54,538 --> 01:05:56,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope to see you guys down here in South America.

1014
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:56,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Sincerely, Igor.

1015
01:05:57,801 --> 01:05:59,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I don't use iTunes.

1016
01:06:01,644 --> 01:06:02,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

1017
01:06:02,245 --> 01:06:04,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I always check to make sure the podcast works okay on iTunes.

1018
01:06:05,087 --> 01:06:09,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been able to duplicate the issue, but you're not the first person I've heard to complain about it.

1019
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:12,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, there's not a lot we can do on our end.

1020
01:06:12,512 --> 01:06:15,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what iTunes is doing to cause it or if it's a server thing.

1021
01:06:16,154 --> 01:06:24,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I think iTunes, if the download moves too slow, and considering how much we get hammered when a new show goes out, because we're distributed on the Xbox,

1022
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:26,014
[SPEAKER_04]: God, now I can't remember.

1023
01:06:26,034 --> 01:06:26,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Live?

1024
01:06:26,454 --> 01:06:27,995
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, not Xbox Live.

1025
01:06:28,015 --> 01:06:29,276
[SPEAKER_04]: The XP Stream, thank you.

1026
01:06:29,596 --> 01:06:37,799
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on that, and that hits us every 15 minutes, so a lot of people hit our show right when it comes out, and I think it might be causing the server to move a little bit slowly.

1027
01:06:37,999 --> 01:06:39,919
[SPEAKER_05]: There are other subscription services you can use.

1028
01:06:39,979 --> 01:06:49,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there are other subscriptions you can use to get on the feed, or you can go to the feed directly and just go to where it says Download Our Podcast on the main site.

1029
01:06:49,823 --> 01:06:52,604
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually pull the MP3s directly from our page.

1030
01:06:53,694 --> 01:07:00,597
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also, you know, you can use Yahoo Podcasts, although they've fallen behind on the listing, so I don't know how much I support that one right now.

1031
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:05,779
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dig, but they mirror the show on their site or something kind of funny.

1032
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:12,121
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're not going to use iTunes, I would suggest maybe like PodNova or the, what is that thing called, Juice?

1033
01:07:12,622 --> 01:07:15,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something like that that would pull down the MP3s as well.

1034
01:07:15,663 --> 01:07:17,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Or go directly to the feed and save it from there.

1035
01:07:18,244 --> 01:07:19,264
[SPEAKER_07]: When I get them, I go to the feed.

1036
01:07:20,004 --> 01:07:21,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can tell you it's reliable.

1037
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:27,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have another one coming from Gorilla, which is cool because I'm a fan.

1038
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:30,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, I see Gorilla and I instantly think Gorillas.

1039
01:07:31,513 --> 01:07:33,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey kids, long time listener and fan of the show.

1040
01:07:33,433 --> 01:07:37,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wanted to comment on some things said on past shows in regards to eBaying Wii or PS3.

1041
01:07:37,594 --> 01:07:39,555
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sort of a long one.

1042
01:07:41,235 --> 01:07:43,096
[SPEAKER_07]: So forgive me if I paraphrase a little bit.

1043
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:47,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally have no problem with someone selling their bought and owned device.

1044
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:51,598
[SPEAKER_07]: If I own a PS3 for two minutes or two years, I own it and have a right to put it up on eBay.

1045
01:07:53,741 --> 01:07:58,785
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone thinks this is wrong, then they should have been in line in front of me and got one, and they could have done whatever they want with it.

1046
01:07:58,805 --> 01:07:59,466
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not my business.

1047
01:08:00,046 --> 01:08:04,930
[SPEAKER_07]: In my own defense, I did get a PS3, and I did wait in line for a Wii, so yeah.

1048
01:08:06,771 --> 01:08:08,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe people should be getting anything the easy way.

1049
01:08:09,053 --> 01:08:10,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I think everyone should work hard for what they have.

1050
01:08:12,135 --> 01:08:14,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the game companies should make enough of it.

1051
01:08:14,437 --> 01:08:15,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's that too.

1052
01:08:16,499 --> 01:08:20,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I fully blame Sony and, you know, greed for the state of that.

1053
01:08:25,383 --> 01:08:33,926
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to be an email I'm going to post on our forums because it is long, but I'm going to read the last paragraph because it sort of mirrors a little bit how I feel about it.

1054
01:08:35,326 --> 01:08:40,227
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you will edit this if you read it on the show, but the bottom line is this is my opinion.

1055
01:08:40,727 --> 01:08:47,229
[SPEAKER_07]: If you own something, no matter how long, especially if you put the time and effort to wait in line with a bunch of people who would never want to stand out,

1056
01:08:47,782 --> 01:08:49,423
[SPEAKER_07]: You never want to stand next to otherwise.

1057
01:08:49,803 --> 01:08:54,764
[SPEAKER_07]: It is your right to self-smash, burn, throw out a window, or keep for years before selling it back to GameStop anyway.

1058
01:08:55,364 --> 01:09:03,047
[SPEAKER_07]: If people don't like it, then tell them when they see an auction for $3,000 on an already overpriced $600 device, don't bid.

1059
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:04,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I do agree with that.

1060
01:09:04,967 --> 01:09:05,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1061
01:09:05,327 --> 01:09:08,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were staunchly against reselling these consoles on eBay.

1062
01:09:09,128 --> 01:09:09,649
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

1063
01:09:10,129 --> 01:09:11,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to say this very specifically.

1064
01:09:12,369 --> 01:09:17,371
[SPEAKER_07]: I am against buying them out for the specific purpose of selling them.

1065
01:09:18,706 --> 01:09:26,711
[SPEAKER_07]: For those people who bought 10 PS3s at 10 different stores in Japan just for the purpose of selling them online, I have a problem with that.

1066
01:09:27,992 --> 01:09:37,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a problem with someone, you know, and I did think about it, you know, I will admit when, you know, I can change my opinion about things after putting lots of thought into it.

1067
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:42,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Say that this is your college tuition, I don't have a problem with that, you know.

1068
01:09:43,194 --> 01:09:51,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you take it home, and so you, I actually don't have a problem if you take it home, play this, if you know this is shit, and put it on eBay, I don't have a problem with that, at all.

1069
01:09:52,818 --> 01:10:01,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a, now, the one problem I have, though, with using it to make a profit for, say, your bills, or for your mortgage, is that it's gambling.

1070
01:10:01,502 --> 01:10:03,263
[SPEAKER_07]: It really, I'm not a gambling person.

1071
01:10:03,884 --> 01:10:04,224
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I...

1072
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:07,302
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1073
01:10:27,967 --> 01:10:28,788
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1074
01:10:53,035 --> 01:10:54,795
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is your right to do so.

1075
01:10:55,035 --> 01:10:55,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with that.

1076
01:10:56,156 --> 01:11:02,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's right for, again, those people who were basically getting the edge on the market by buying 100 PS3s and selling them on eBay.

1077
01:11:02,877 --> 01:11:04,557
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, yeah, that's much.

1078
01:11:04,598 --> 01:11:05,118
[SPEAKER_04]: That's abuse.

1079
01:11:05,338 --> 01:11:05,798
[SPEAKER_07]: That's sick.

1080
01:11:06,558 --> 01:11:11,879
[SPEAKER_07]: What, but I think that, yeah, all those people, though, who are paying the money for them on eBay, gouge them.

1081
01:11:12,599 --> 01:11:13,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Make them pay.

1082
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,420
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because they didn't stand in line and put any damn effort into it.

1083
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:20,761
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, those people deserve to get ripped off.

1084
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:24,872
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it's disposable income, then you know what?

1085
01:11:24,932 --> 01:11:30,674
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to take those people away from their disposable income and make them go work hard for something.

1086
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:34,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a problem with that.

1087
01:11:36,116 --> 01:11:42,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that people should actually have to work hard for what they have instead of just having it handed to them on a platter.

1088
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:49,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I don't mind when anybody hands me anything on a platter, but I also work hard for everything else I have.

1089
01:11:50,009 --> 01:11:52,430
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a different story if you just get everything you want.

1090
01:11:53,331 --> 01:11:54,832
[SPEAKER_07]: If you work hard, you should be able to get something.

1091
01:11:55,192 --> 01:11:55,572
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway.

1092
01:11:56,713 --> 01:12:00,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks and love the show for keeping up all the good work and reviews.

1093
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:02,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I did buy an Xbox 360 and am keeping it.

1094
01:12:02,536 --> 01:12:03,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're cool.

1095
01:12:04,097 --> 01:12:06,198
[SPEAKER_07]: It's from Gorilla.

1096
01:12:06,278 --> 01:12:07,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Post your game and tag on the forums.

1097
01:12:07,879 --> 01:12:08,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Join the OL Army.

1098
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:09,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Email from Chicago.

1099
01:12:11,121 --> 01:12:11,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicago.

1100
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:17,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Once in a while, you should have a retro game segment and feature past systems such as the 3DO game system.

1101
01:12:18,686 --> 01:12:19,926
[SPEAKER_07]: which I loved and still own.

1102
01:12:20,126 --> 01:12:21,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you're entitled to that.

1103
01:12:21,627 --> 01:12:22,367
[SPEAKER_07]: I was way ahead of its time.

1104
01:12:22,387 --> 01:12:24,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're allowed to love it if you really want to love that system.

1105
01:12:24,927 --> 01:12:26,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Before PS1 came out and killed it.

1106
01:12:27,087 --> 01:12:31,448
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, actually, you must have ESPN.

1107
01:12:31,608 --> 01:12:32,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, ESP.

1108
01:12:33,088 --> 01:12:35,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Because look for something like that to be coming out next year.

1109
01:12:35,369 --> 01:12:36,049
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1110
01:12:37,169 --> 01:12:37,589
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more.

1111
01:12:38,469 --> 01:12:38,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1112
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:41,570
[SPEAKER_04]: More emails from Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

1113
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have learned giants by the time I'm done with this segment.

1114
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:44,130
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

1115
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:45,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guys and girl.

1116
01:12:45,631 --> 01:12:47,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Jamie, I wouldn't forget your angsty self.

1117
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:47,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.

1118
01:12:48,658 --> 01:12:52,400
[SPEAKER_07]: It's them and yeah, it's been going good down here in Texas, I suppose.

1119
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,622
[SPEAKER_07]: The stars at night shine big and bright.

1120
01:12:57,082 --> 01:12:57,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Ow!

1121
01:12:57,942 --> 01:12:59,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't clap with the microphone in my hand.

1122
01:13:00,603 --> 01:13:01,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, can't help it.

1123
01:13:02,424 --> 01:13:02,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Pee-wee.

1124
01:13:03,525 --> 01:13:05,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Just recently I had an idea for a game.

1125
01:13:05,746 --> 01:13:08,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Now don't you start spouting off, I smell a Konami lawsuit.

1126
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:10,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami will sue!

1127
01:13:10,828 --> 01:13:11,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey!

1128
01:13:11,857 --> 01:13:14,799
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was thinking of making a Stepmania-type game for the arcade.

1129
01:13:14,919 --> 01:13:19,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I have ideas and such, but right now, nothing has been done, and I'm trying to get the word out.

1130
01:13:20,221 --> 01:13:25,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing as how I love your show, and I know everybody else should, maybe I can find some help with this.

1131
01:13:25,844 --> 01:13:27,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to read out the email yet.

1132
01:13:30,003 --> 01:13:31,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Enough of my shameless self-promoting or whatever.

1133
01:13:31,885 --> 01:13:32,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1134
01:13:32,185 --> 01:13:34,947
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's going to change subjects, I want to talk about the Step Mania thing for just a minute.

1135
01:13:35,007 --> 01:13:35,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that just in the groove?

1136
01:13:36,108 --> 01:13:40,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I imagine this person must have some type of separate idea that differentiates it from in the groove.

1137
01:13:40,492 --> 01:13:42,794
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it wasn't in the groove, just Step Mania.

1138
01:13:43,214 --> 01:13:47,918
[SPEAKER_04]: And, Loki, you actually had a Step Mania cabinet that you helped build for a local arcade.

1139
01:13:48,279 --> 01:13:50,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us briefly, in a minute or so, what was your experience with that?

1140
01:13:51,361 --> 01:13:52,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pain in the ass.

1141
01:13:52,342 --> 01:13:52,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1142
01:13:52,462 --> 01:13:53,543
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?

1143
01:13:53,643 --> 01:13:54,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the computers.

1144
01:13:56,426 --> 01:13:57,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Normal computers don't like

1145
01:13:58,582 --> 01:14:01,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, normal, um, arcade cabinet environments.

1146
01:14:01,344 --> 01:14:02,885
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, they get too damn hot.

1147
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:18,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, at the time I didn't have the right tools to basically put a image on that type of a screen because the arcade screens run at, um, what they call CGA, which is a very low resolution, um, screen.

1148
01:14:18,574 --> 01:14:23,217
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks nice in the arcade because, you know, it's really old screen.

1149
01:14:23,297 --> 01:14:23,677
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um,

1150
01:14:24,717 --> 01:14:26,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pain in the ass, let me put it that way.

1151
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:39,981
[SPEAKER_03]: But now within the groups, you know, arcade stuff, since they just run a PC anyways, you can actually buy a lot of the stuff from like third-party manufacturers and be able to create your own Stepmania cabinet really easy now.

1152
01:14:40,501 --> 01:14:44,722
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, they actually built Stepmania builds meant for arcade cabinets.

1153
01:14:45,362 --> 01:14:50,964
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you build a cool enough computer, and it's also hard too because you have to get the computer to turn on

1154
01:14:51,885 --> 01:14:53,426
[SPEAKER_03]: with the actual cabinet stuff.

1155
01:14:53,466 --> 01:14:58,127
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you can rig that all up, then yeah, it's pretty easy to do once you've got the setup.

1156
01:14:58,567 --> 01:15:00,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1157
01:15:00,547 --> 01:15:01,408
[SPEAKER_07]: To continue with the email.

1158
01:15:02,488 --> 01:15:03,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get to my main point.

1159
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:08,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I recently picked up a Nintendo DS and was hoping to pick up a copy of Final Fantasy 3 for it at the closest GameStop.

1160
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:14,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, well, I have a good reason to get all angsty about the franchise now seeing as how they didn't even have a copy in.

1161
01:15:15,091 --> 01:15:17,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Before this, they sold me a defective 2DX game.

1162
01:15:17,492 --> 01:15:19,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

1163
01:15:20,353 --> 01:15:20,813
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like me.

1164
01:15:21,508 --> 01:15:23,889
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's all I really have to say.

1165
01:15:24,309 --> 01:15:27,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Still waiting to get a 360 or are we, me being the poor bastard I am.

1166
01:15:29,351 --> 01:15:34,993
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, I suggest, I don't really think it's the GameStop because they have the stock that they have at the time.

1167
01:15:35,534 --> 01:15:36,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Use your phone, give them a call.

1168
01:15:38,175 --> 01:15:40,796
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I live close to three GameStops.

1169
01:15:40,816 --> 01:15:46,298
[SPEAKER_04]: If I have been told by a GameStop rep previously, I'm too busy to look, come down here.

1170
01:15:46,903 --> 01:15:50,084
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's when I decided I wasn't going to support that particular store anymore.

1171
01:15:50,144 --> 01:15:55,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I realized that was that store and not the chain as a whole but that's when I realized I wasn't ever going to go down there ever.

1172
01:15:56,086 --> 01:15:58,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Then again, usually I'll have to just say, hey, this is Dan's wife.

1173
01:15:59,487 --> 01:16:00,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know.

1174
01:16:00,847 --> 01:16:07,449
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, I actually... I don't get on the phone and go, I have a podcast on the internet so you damn well better help me or I'm going to talk shit about you.

1175
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:09,229
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just call like anyone else does, you know?

1176
01:16:09,489 --> 01:16:15,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, usually what I do is I call and then, you know, if it's one of the managers I've met before then I'll say, hey, yeah, it's me.

1177
01:16:15,431 --> 01:16:15,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1178
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:38,282
[SPEAKER_07]: but um honestly though really if you I found a few people who are willing to look to say hey I'm you know I'm going to be coming by if you have this I'm going to be giving you money if you have this but you know I've been in a GameStop when it's busy and when they say they don't have time to look it means they don't have time to look they are that is the

1179
01:16:38,985 --> 01:16:40,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is a fault of GameStop Corporate.

1180
01:16:40,086 --> 01:16:42,507
[SPEAKER_04]: They do not want to give the hours they need to man the stores.

1181
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:54,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going back to that store.

1182
01:16:54,931 --> 01:16:55,972
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the manager's fault.

1183
01:16:56,032 --> 01:16:57,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I teach customer service for a living.

1184
01:16:57,754 --> 01:16:59,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I get offended when people do that kind of shit.

1185
01:16:59,555 --> 01:17:03,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I was in customer service for a while, too, and I know what I expect of myself.

1186
01:17:03,699 --> 01:17:04,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

1187
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,985
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're too busy at that one time, then obviously they're too busy to ring me up at the register.

1188
01:17:10,305 --> 01:17:12,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I put you on hold?

1189
01:17:12,106 --> 01:17:17,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And they could have one employee that's not necessarily working the register because not everyone has to be working the register at the time.

1190
01:17:18,012 --> 01:17:19,453
[SPEAKER_03]: They have one employee to check on that.

1191
01:17:19,753 --> 01:17:20,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I put you on hold?

1192
01:17:21,967 --> 01:17:23,147
[SPEAKER_07]: They are supposed to put you on hold.

1193
01:17:23,187 --> 01:17:25,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are supposed to have you on hold as long as you're on hold.

1194
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:27,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I walked right over to the next... You know what?

1195
01:17:27,948 --> 01:17:29,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, I walked right over to the next store.

1196
01:17:29,529 --> 01:17:31,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Best Buy picked up my game, left.

1197
01:17:31,289 --> 01:17:31,689
[SPEAKER_04]: In and out.

1198
01:17:31,809 --> 01:17:32,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Very easy.

1199
01:17:32,349 --> 01:17:34,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I bought all my games for a little while.

1200
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:39,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, and it's not really, I think, so much the fault of the store managers.

1201
01:17:39,971 --> 01:17:44,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Because having talked to a number of them, they're all like, we need more hours, we need more hours, we need more hours.

1202
01:17:45,092 --> 01:17:46,552
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's corporate that's not giving it to them.

1203
01:17:46,692 --> 01:17:47,352
[SPEAKER_07]: So blame them.

1204
01:17:48,073 --> 01:17:50,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know whose fault it is, but it sucks.

1205
01:17:51,537 --> 01:17:53,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Last one comes from Neki.

1206
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:54,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's how it's pronounced.

1207
01:17:55,719 --> 01:17:58,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Downloaded for the first time off iTunes and it's great.

1208
01:17:58,221 --> 01:17:59,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice community feel to it.

1209
01:17:59,862 --> 01:18:02,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm from the UK so can't do any of the live forums, etc.

1210
01:18:03,425 --> 01:18:05,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Like to hear a few more stories about the UK.

1211
01:18:06,267 --> 01:18:06,807
[SPEAKER_07]: We do our best.

1212
01:18:07,428 --> 01:18:08,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I look when I can.

1213
01:18:09,829 --> 01:18:11,190
[SPEAKER_07]: WePlay is already out in the UK.

1214
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:15,113
[SPEAKER_07]: In the last podcast you said it wasn't out but maybe that's only in the US.

1215
01:18:16,004 --> 01:18:18,966
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably were talking about the US, because we're not getting it until February.

1216
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,808
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we had a big story on the delay of Wii Play last week.

1217
01:18:22,608 --> 01:18:27,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas you guys, I think, you are just now getting Wii Sports, whereas we added it as a pack-in with our system.

1218
01:18:27,672 --> 01:18:28,512
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of interesting.

1219
01:18:30,093 --> 01:18:31,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, looking forward to the next podcast.

1220
01:18:31,494 --> 01:18:33,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Until next time, Neki.

1221
01:18:35,316 --> 01:18:39,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really, actually, I do try to look for UK-specific stuff.

1222
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,801
[SPEAKER_07]: More like Europe in general.

1223
01:18:42,821 --> 01:18:42,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I...

1224
01:18:44,815 --> 01:18:49,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, honestly, I myself have a lot of love for the UK, and I want to make sure that our folks are covered.

1225
01:18:49,419 --> 01:19:00,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, keep in mind, a big part of it is, too, is that a lot of stuff, you know, and I don't mean to offend or whatever, but a lot of stuff comes up in Japan and the US first, and then the UK just kind of gets it later.

1226
01:19:00,828 --> 01:19:10,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to say that there aren't specific things to the UK, you know, obviously, and Jamie tries to stay on top of those, but it's just kind of the nature of the business is most of the business is done in Tokyo and in the Bay Area, you know?

1227
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:10,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1228
01:19:12,074 --> 01:19:16,075
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to keep tabs on release dates and things of that nature because we heart our international listeners.

1229
01:19:16,795 --> 01:19:20,836
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep in mind, usually when games are under development and things, it is kind of over on this side.

1230
01:19:22,176 --> 01:19:25,597
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, they do get some games that we don't get, like mostly football.

1231
01:19:25,917 --> 01:19:27,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Once in a while, once in a while.

1232
01:19:27,477 --> 01:19:29,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the games of that nature.

1233
01:19:29,918 --> 01:19:32,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I try to keep my eyes open for specific ones.

1234
01:19:32,179 --> 01:19:33,099
[SPEAKER_04]: So think of it this way.

1235
01:19:33,159 --> 01:19:38,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, at least if we're getting the games first, we can tell you which ones suck, and then that way you don't even have to blink an eye when they come out over there.

1236
01:19:39,355 --> 01:19:39,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1237
01:19:40,255 --> 01:19:43,536
[SPEAKER_04]: For what little it's worth, because we can't force the companies to change their schedules or whatever.

1238
01:19:43,996 --> 01:19:53,219
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I think we had a slightly increased listenership this week, because iTunes had us, they have video games as their featured category in podcasts this week, and we're one of them that's in the little box, so that's kind of cool.

1239
01:19:53,559 --> 01:19:55,460
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thank you iTunes!

1240
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it for voicemails?

1241
01:19:58,761 --> 01:19:59,461
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be it.

1242
01:19:59,681 --> 01:20:00,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

1243
01:20:00,641 --> 01:20:01,502
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean emails?

1244
01:20:02,562 --> 01:20:04,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, emails, sorry.

1245
01:20:04,363 --> 01:20:07,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them my voice!

1246
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:09,124
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to leave us a voicemail.

1247
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:13,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I want voicemail from some of our overseas listeners now.

1248
01:20:16,846 --> 01:20:17,266
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1249
01:20:17,306 --> 01:20:19,228
[SPEAKER_04]: This listener could call our voicemail any time.

1250
01:20:19,528 --> 01:20:22,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, don't use the 800, but you can go through Skype.

1251
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:22,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1252
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:22,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1253
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:23,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's right.

1254
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:25,292
[SPEAKER_04]: International folks don't want to use it, unless you're Canadian.

1255
01:20:25,472 --> 01:20:26,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're Canadian.

1256
01:20:26,593 --> 01:20:27,153
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use the 800.

1257
01:20:27,513 --> 01:20:28,974
[SPEAKER_07]: But download Skype.

1258
01:20:29,515 --> 01:20:32,637
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually just send us a message through the Skype line.

1259
01:20:32,737 --> 01:20:33,697
[SPEAKER_07]: It's voice over IP.

1260
01:20:34,338 --> 01:20:35,859
[SPEAKER_07]: It costs your internet connection.

1261
01:20:35,899 --> 01:20:36,219
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1262
01:20:36,379 --> 01:20:36,659
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1263
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:40,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com and click on Interact With Us for more information.

1264
01:20:40,642 --> 01:20:41,062
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all free.

1265
01:20:41,783 --> 01:20:42,083
[SPEAKER_04]: All free?

1266
01:20:42,423 --> 01:20:42,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

1267
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

1268
01:20:44,414 --> 01:20:46,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, getting back into some news here.

1269
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:51,557
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that we talk about, especially in games and stuff, is all these ads.

1270
01:20:52,178 --> 01:21:01,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And a big thing when we were doing the Battlefield 2142 stuff was that their advertisements had a little kind of a spyware feel to it.

1271
01:21:01,722 --> 01:21:05,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they were picking up your IP and where you're located and

1272
01:21:06,856 --> 01:21:08,998
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of thing so they could target ads towards you.

1273
01:21:09,258 --> 01:21:11,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a huge deal to some people, but a big deal to others.

1274
01:21:12,181 --> 01:21:15,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently it's a big deal to some California lawmakers.

1275
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:30,556
[SPEAKER_03]: California Assemblywoman Lori Saldana is going to be working on introducing a bill into state legislation that would halt companies like EA from including Spyware technology in games.

1276
01:21:31,517 --> 01:21:34,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they found, you know, certain...

1277
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:38,621
[SPEAKER_03]: methods used by these companies as particularly vile, as she puts it.

1278
01:21:39,301 --> 01:21:44,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And definitely something that I'd like to see passed because, you know, I'm not sure.

1279
01:21:44,464 --> 01:21:46,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's on our show role.

1280
01:21:46,805 --> 01:21:49,747
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about like advertising games and how it's not very effective.

1281
01:21:50,127 --> 01:22:00,173
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, gathering information from these companies and the EA is really bad on this, you know, especially with where you have to sign up and have your credit card information and stuff like that.

1282
01:22:00,193 --> 01:22:00,833
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not good.

1283
01:22:01,201 --> 01:22:04,963
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm interested in is, you know, she seems to get it.

1284
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:05,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1285
01:22:05,984 --> 01:22:07,304
[SPEAKER_04]: What, who is she?

1286
01:22:07,404 --> 01:22:09,926
[SPEAKER_04]: How did she figure out about, I mean, is she a gamer?

1287
01:22:10,826 --> 01:22:13,267
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just, I don't know, she just seems to get it.

1288
01:22:13,627 --> 01:22:13,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1289
01:22:14,328 --> 01:22:22,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have, because, you know, one thing we felt like we don't, we haven't had much of in the political world is some type of pro-gaming champion, you know what I mean?

1290
01:22:22,492 --> 01:22:28,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean like a professional gamer, but I mean like somebody who supports the video games and the gaming community.

1291
01:22:28,555 --> 01:22:29,916
[SPEAKER_04]: We've certainly had a lot of anti-

1292
01:22:31,331 --> 01:22:35,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she's kind of interested in, it's mainly privacy experts.

1293
01:22:35,792 --> 01:22:38,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, so she's more of like an EFF type champion.

1294
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:42,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think this just kind of relates a little bit to stuff like that.

1295
01:22:42,313 --> 01:22:48,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically she's saying that it doesn't advertise it on the outside of the packaging and it contains the stuff.

1296
01:22:48,475 --> 01:22:57,277
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you bought it and then, oh, by the way, we forgot to mention that, you know, that installing this will actually send us some private data.

1297
01:22:57,377 --> 01:22:59,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need to do this in order to play the game.

1298
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:03,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just like to see someone who gets gaming in Congress, that's all.

1299
01:23:04,123 --> 01:23:04,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, run for Congress.

1300
01:23:06,025 --> 01:23:07,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, pay my way.

1301
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:11,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Vote for Jamie, kay thanks.

1302
01:23:12,933 --> 01:23:14,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, vote for Jamie, or die.

1303
01:23:15,577 --> 01:23:18,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway, well that should be interesting to see what happens with that.

1304
01:23:19,261 --> 01:23:20,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's kind of cool.

1305
01:23:21,059 --> 01:23:26,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's something that should... I think the company should know they're going to be looked at if they're going to use these type of tactics.

1306
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:28,341
[SPEAKER_04]: So I support it.

1307
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:30,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to see what the specifics of the bill will be.

1308
01:23:32,862 --> 01:23:41,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Since this is our holiday episode, this last official story we have for you guys has to do with Bethesda and their big, big, big game, Oblivion.

1309
01:23:42,143 --> 01:23:47,585
[SPEAKER_04]: They are giving away for Christmas a brand new expansion pack for Oblivion.

1310
01:23:47,645 --> 01:23:49,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not new, but it's...

1311
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:52,271
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Christmas theme pack or whatever.

1312
01:23:52,671 --> 01:23:54,292
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not a theme pack either.

1313
01:23:54,592 --> 01:23:55,733
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the older expansions.

1314
01:23:55,773 --> 01:23:56,854
[SPEAKER_03]: They dropped the price to free.

1315
01:23:57,914 --> 01:23:59,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I thought it was a new one.

1316
01:24:00,115 --> 01:24:01,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, all right.

1317
01:24:01,456 --> 01:24:01,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, whatever.

1318
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:06,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Maroon's Razor, which I guess used to cost money, it's now being offered for free.

1319
01:24:06,619 --> 01:24:08,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that sucks to everyone who bought it before.

1320
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:09,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

1321
01:24:09,861 --> 01:24:11,902
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are grinches for doing that to those people.

1322
01:24:12,602 --> 01:24:14,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I have not played any of the Oblivion expansions.

1323
01:24:15,024 --> 01:24:17,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize for my mistake.

1324
01:24:17,981 --> 01:24:19,001
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1325
01:24:37,093 --> 01:24:37,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Tis the season.

1326
01:24:38,293 --> 01:24:41,874
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess Nintendo is the Grinch after all, not putting out anything free.

1327
01:24:41,894 --> 01:24:44,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they did have the internet channel, so maybe not.

1328
01:24:44,715 --> 01:24:49,456
[SPEAKER_04]: They did give you that, and the forecast channel, and coming up the news channel too.

1329
01:24:49,856 --> 01:24:51,257
[SPEAKER_04]: But the internet channel, you know, is free.

1330
01:24:51,517 --> 01:24:54,217
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess we all got a little something for Christmas.

1331
01:24:54,297 --> 01:24:57,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Now here's something I gotta mention though, and I'm not sure if you noticed.

1332
01:24:57,758 --> 01:24:59,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii Connect 24, what the fuck does it actually do?

1333
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:01,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it sure as hell doesn't update my system.

1334
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:04,940
[SPEAKER_03]: It sure as hell doesn't download this new stuff automatically.

1335
01:25:06,192 --> 01:25:06,712
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck?

1336
01:25:06,792 --> 01:25:07,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

1337
01:25:32,173 --> 01:25:33,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least you get that message.

1338
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:34,896
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, I don't know.

1339
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:36,358
[SPEAKER_04]: At least you have the message, right?

1340
01:25:36,378 --> 01:25:39,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo sent you a little email that said the forecast channel is now available, right?

1341
01:25:39,702 --> 01:25:40,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, great.

1342
01:25:40,543 --> 01:25:41,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for them.

1343
01:25:41,244 --> 01:25:43,646
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not, you know, this WeConnect24.

1344
01:25:43,726 --> 01:25:46,129
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always connected to the internet.

1345
01:25:48,051 --> 01:25:50,514
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's always connected, but it's not doing anything.

1346
01:25:50,534 --> 01:25:51,956
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1347
01:25:53,365 --> 01:26:04,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have another segment here before we close out the show and that would be DarkSakura who likes to surf the internet up and down and left and right and all that be a select start kind of stuff.

1348
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:11,780
[SPEAKER_04]: She finds a website that she must share with all of you guys and it's called DarkSakura's Website of the Week.

1349
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:12,721
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have happy music.

1350
01:26:17,284 --> 01:26:19,046
[SPEAKER_04]: So this week's website better be happy.

1351
01:26:19,891 --> 01:26:21,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't do crap to find it, you told me about it.

1352
01:26:21,932 --> 01:26:23,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh goody, you used my pick.

1353
01:26:23,353 --> 01:26:25,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a suggestion, and it got picked.

1354
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:26,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited.

1355
01:26:26,955 --> 01:26:30,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Weekitty.com, W-I-I-K-I-T-T-Y dot com.

1356
01:26:31,057 --> 01:26:32,298
[SPEAKER_07]: This site is crack.

1357
01:26:32,678 --> 01:26:35,800
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a gallery of cats and wees, and it's so cute.

1358
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,281
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the kitty.

1359
01:26:37,821 --> 01:26:40,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like stuff on my cat, but with Wii controllers?

1360
01:26:40,222 --> 01:26:40,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1361
01:26:40,663 --> 01:26:41,403
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1362
01:26:41,443 --> 01:26:42,324
[SPEAKER_07]: This is fantastic.

1363
01:26:42,444 --> 01:26:43,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to do one with Shermie.

1364
01:26:44,305 --> 01:26:48,167
[SPEAKER_07]: And on top of that, they actually say Happy Caturday, which makes me think of 4chan.

1365
01:26:49,471 --> 01:26:51,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, this is cute.

1366
01:26:52,935 --> 01:26:54,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to submit Shermie on WeKitty.

1367
01:26:55,599 --> 01:26:59,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go look at WeKitty on my Wii and bookmark it as a favorite.

1368
01:26:59,323 --> 01:27:02,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have Shermie snuggling up to an Xbox 360 controller.

1369
01:27:02,928 --> 01:27:03,829
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1370
01:27:03,849 --> 01:27:06,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you should make 360kitty.com.

1371
01:27:07,033 --> 01:27:08,495
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not going to pay for the domain.

1372
01:27:09,278 --> 01:27:09,638
[SPEAKER_04]: They're cheap.

1373
01:27:09,658 --> 01:27:09,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm poor.

1374
01:27:10,259 --> 01:27:10,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you can do it.

1375
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do it.

1376
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:16,865
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you should put, like, PS3Kitty.com and have PS3 crushing the cat because it's so good.

1377
01:27:16,925 --> 01:27:17,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it.

1378
01:27:17,386 --> 01:27:17,906
[SPEAKER_06]: CatBox360.

1379
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:22,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And have, like, do, like, litter boxes up like an Xbox.

1380
01:27:24,612 --> 01:27:25,233
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be rad.

1381
01:27:25,753 --> 01:27:32,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I did notice that WeKitty did use the opportunity to give a big fat plug for the people who made it their own personal little game review site.

1382
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,821
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we could use...

1383
01:27:35,132 --> 01:27:36,693
[SPEAKER_04]: 360 Kitty or whatever is a big plug.

1384
01:27:37,093 --> 01:27:37,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1385
01:27:37,433 --> 01:27:38,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to jump on the bandwagon.

1386
01:27:38,835 --> 01:27:40,196
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Xbox Puppy?

1387
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the love for the puppies?

1388
01:27:42,798 --> 01:27:43,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Puppies are stinky.

1389
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And they require too much attention.

1390
01:27:46,201 --> 01:27:50,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I would admit that I'm a cat person over a dog person, but I do think puppies do deserve a little bit of love.

1391
01:27:51,245 --> 01:27:53,747
[SPEAKER_04]: How about DSGirbles.com?

1392
01:27:55,629 --> 01:27:57,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Lovehamster.com.

1393
01:27:57,470 --> 01:27:57,951
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1394
01:28:00,172 --> 01:28:00,493
[SPEAKER_04]: With a P.

1395
01:28:02,153 --> 01:28:02,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Pro Evolution Sucker 6 Hey

1396
01:28:29,283 --> 01:28:33,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Pro Evolution Soccer 6 is now a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace.

1397
01:28:34,685 --> 01:28:38,266
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the rival of FIFA 07.

1398
01:28:39,726 --> 01:28:48,349
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only available for Xbox Gold, but it will be available to Silver on the 29th, and it's a 1.31 gigabyte game.

1399
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:50,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us what's on it, because we don't know.

1400
01:28:52,511 --> 01:28:53,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a football girl, but

1401
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:58,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't this the same one we saw an early build of at the Panami BBQ?

1402
01:28:58,993 --> 01:29:01,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked pretty hot.

1403
01:29:01,935 --> 01:29:02,495
[SPEAKER_04]: For soccer.

1404
01:29:04,316 --> 01:29:08,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I'm necessarily... Okay, I have to say, I do love football.

1405
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:09,300
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit.

1406
01:29:10,621 --> 01:29:13,563
[SPEAKER_04]: But not... You're a rugby girl.

1407
01:29:13,843 --> 01:29:14,304
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

1408
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:17,066
[SPEAKER_07]: When I say football, I mean soccer.

1409
01:29:17,626 --> 01:29:18,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Because American football is shit.

1410
01:29:19,748 --> 01:29:20,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Pure and simple.

1411
01:29:20,328 --> 01:29:20,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, it is.

1412
01:29:20,968 --> 01:29:21,389
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crap.

1413
01:29:21,789 --> 01:29:24,471
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a crap sport, and it's just crap.

1414
01:29:24,964 --> 01:29:29,746
[SPEAKER_03]: More people would probably watch football if they had cheerleaders like American football.

1415
01:29:29,766 --> 01:29:33,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet it seems to be the most popular sport in this nation.

1416
01:29:33,967 --> 01:29:36,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and the rest of the world says, screw you, that's stupid.

1417
01:29:37,168 --> 01:29:37,928
[SPEAKER_07]: We like real football.

1418
01:29:38,848 --> 01:29:40,969
[SPEAKER_07]: And it gives me an excuse to watch men in shorts.

1419
01:29:41,129 --> 01:29:41,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I like basketball.

1420
01:29:41,969 --> 01:29:43,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you know what?

1421
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:48,712
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of the world may be all about this metric system, but hey, we're too good for that.

1422
01:29:48,852 --> 01:29:52,613
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about fucking base 12 systems.

1423
01:29:52,673 --> 01:29:53,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.

1424
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:54,941
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean the Imperial system?

1425
01:29:55,221 --> 01:29:55,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1426
01:29:56,101 --> 01:30:03,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, doesn't it sound better, or doesn't it sound much nicer to hear that it's only, you know, it's 40 degrees Fahrenheit outside?

1427
01:30:04,365 --> 01:30:07,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't it sound so bad as, you know, negative two!

1428
01:30:07,287 --> 01:30:10,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, forget it, never mind.

1429
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:12,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's another one as well.

1430
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:17,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo... For the record, I agree, the metric system is better.

1431
01:30:18,908 --> 01:30:19,529
[SPEAKER_04]: to get that on record.

1432
01:30:19,549 --> 01:30:27,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo has stated that the reports that came out of France saying that Wii Sports 2 is already in development is quote, a rumor and speculation.

1433
01:30:29,729 --> 01:30:32,051
[SPEAKER_04]: But pretty good speculation of that, honestly.

1434
01:30:32,071 --> 01:30:39,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, NGC France reported that there was one that might include swimming, basketball, a few other sports.

1435
01:30:40,538 --> 01:30:44,761
[SPEAKER_07]: The quote, though, coming from Nintendo, was really pleased with the reaction to Wii Sports.

1436
01:30:45,422 --> 01:30:51,607
[SPEAKER_07]: From people completely new to gaming, to the hardcore fans, everywhere has taken to it straight away.

1437
01:30:52,488 --> 01:30:55,590
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a quote from one of the Nintendo UK spokespeople.

1438
01:30:56,831 --> 01:30:58,953
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're actually speculating it might be the most popular game.

1439
01:31:00,745 --> 01:31:01,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1440
01:31:01,585 --> 01:31:02,586
[SPEAKER_04]: No love for Wii Soccer.

1441
01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:04,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, that would be cool.

1442
01:31:04,846 --> 01:31:06,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you kick your controller around there?

1443
01:31:06,467 --> 01:31:06,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1444
01:31:06,827 --> 01:31:07,467
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you do that?

1445
01:31:08,527 --> 01:31:11,888
[SPEAKER_07]: You put your controller in the ball moat.

1446
01:31:13,949 --> 01:31:15,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it detects directions.

1447
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,130
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great idea.

1448
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:22,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Then people can kick the ball around the house because the Wiis aren't breaking enough things around the house as it is.

1449
01:31:23,112 --> 01:31:24,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Kick a ball through the window.

1450
01:31:24,932 --> 01:31:25,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Real smart, Jamie.

1451
01:31:26,613 --> 01:31:27,433
[SPEAKER_04]: A winner is you.

1452
01:31:27,953 --> 01:31:28,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Was I serious?

1453
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:29,894
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1454
01:31:30,302 --> 01:31:30,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Partially.

1455
01:31:31,423 --> 01:31:31,543
No.

1456
01:31:53,914 --> 01:32:02,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was kind of, like, it was stupid in the gameplay value, but, like, getting to chop people's arms and legs off and then they still have to fight with no arms or legs was really funny.

1457
01:32:05,116 --> 01:32:05,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Playfighter, man.

1458
01:32:05,696 --> 01:32:06,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your arms off.

1459
01:32:07,217 --> 01:32:08,777
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, you have any last-minute stories for us?

1460
01:32:08,877 --> 01:32:09,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course I do.

1461
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:11,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the story came out.

1462
01:32:11,898 --> 01:32:18,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, there's a way modifying your own DVD firmware in your own CD-ROM drive or DVD-ROM drive on your PC.

1463
01:32:19,699 --> 01:32:21,420
[SPEAKER_03]: You're able to rip Wii discs.

1464
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:21,860
[SPEAKER_03]: So, now...

1465
01:32:23,032 --> 01:32:24,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Pirates have won yet another battle.

1466
01:32:26,094 --> 01:32:29,256
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only a matter of time before we see pirated games being run on the Wii.

1467
01:32:29,837 --> 01:32:32,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Until Nintendo says, oh, you want that news channel?

1468
01:32:33,259 --> 01:32:35,921
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they'll use Wii Connect 24 with the updates.

1469
01:32:36,161 --> 01:32:39,504
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll just silently push out the updates that'll patch that kind of shit.

1470
01:32:40,564 --> 01:32:41,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they haven't done it yet.

1471
01:32:42,686 --> 01:32:43,146
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1472
01:32:43,526 --> 01:32:46,148
[SPEAKER_03]: And who says I have to connect it to the internet while I'm playing these games?

1473
01:32:46,529 --> 01:32:52,673
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, if they can burn them the exact same way as the discs are burnt now, they'll never know.

1474
01:32:53,158 --> 01:32:53,818
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see, we'll see.

1475
01:32:54,198 --> 01:32:57,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, that being said, let's see here.

1476
01:32:58,519 --> 01:33:00,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it's kind of funny.

1477
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:07,282
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how if you register three games with Nintendo that you get a free three-month trial to Nintendo Power?

1478
01:33:07,662 --> 01:33:15,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently the folks at GoNintendo.com found out that the Wii Internet channel counts as a game, and now they get a free subscription.

1479
01:33:15,944 --> 01:33:16,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

1480
01:33:17,785 --> 01:33:18,345
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of funny.

1481
01:33:18,545 --> 01:33:19,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it really?

1482
01:33:19,305 --> 01:33:19,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't.

1483
01:33:19,969 --> 01:33:21,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I have my subscription all the time.

1484
01:33:21,409 --> 01:33:23,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have all my Nintendo products registered in Nintendo.

1485
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:26,531
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot now because of those stinking virtual console games.

1486
01:33:26,951 --> 01:33:31,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the virtual console tied to my Nintendo account and you get credit for all those games you download.

1487
01:33:31,452 --> 01:33:37,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish here in the US they did some type of reward systems like they did in the other countries.

1488
01:33:37,294 --> 01:33:43,276
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're using the Wii browser and find that you really want tabbed browsing in the Wii, well, fear not.

1489
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:46,417
[SPEAKER_03]: The website has actually figured out a way to do that.

1490
01:33:46,957 --> 01:33:49,558
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to browse tabbed

1491
01:33:50,276 --> 01:33:59,724
[SPEAKER_03]: websites, you can check out team-dsx.net slash ds slash basic.php.

1492
01:34:00,384 --> 01:34:09,471
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently this was used for the Opera Browser on the DS, but can also be used for the Wii Opera Browser to add tab to the browsing functionality.

1493
01:34:09,712 --> 01:34:13,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want tab browsing so much as I want support for my USB keyboard.

1494
01:34:14,255 --> 01:34:14,776
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be nice.

1495
01:34:16,057 --> 01:34:16,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

1496
01:34:17,092 --> 01:34:34,546
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course since there was the free Gran Turismo HD demo being put out there actually ended up leaking a little bit early on the PlayStation 3 network and crashed it because it was more than it could handle which is kind of fun.

1497
01:34:34,566 --> 01:34:36,387
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

1498
01:34:36,688 --> 01:34:45,434
[SPEAKER_03]: We mentioned that Bethesda is putting out the free Oblivion expansion or I should say dropping the price on it but more

1499
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Test Drive Unlimited Test Drive Unlimited

1500
01:35:12,293 --> 01:35:20,000
[SPEAKER_03]: McLaren, F1 GT, Dodge Viper, SRT 10, Coop, and many more.

1501
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:21,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of cool.

1502
01:35:21,981 --> 01:35:32,931
[SPEAKER_03]: They've also got a free Forza Motorsports Showdown trailer, which is available on both Canada and US Xbox Live.

1503
01:35:34,873 --> 01:35:39,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also three different Command & Conquer Tiberian Wars trailers

1504
01:35:40,714 --> 01:35:41,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1505
01:35:57,068 --> 01:35:58,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of surprised it wasn't that bad.

1506
01:35:58,929 --> 01:36:01,449
[SPEAKER_04]: And keep in mind, I'm not as attached to Transformers.

1507
01:36:01,469 --> 01:36:03,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen it yet.

1508
01:36:03,570 --> 01:36:04,730
[SPEAKER_04]: You haven't seen the Transformers?

1509
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:05,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

1510
01:36:05,491 --> 01:36:06,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been busy.

1511
01:36:06,851 --> 01:36:10,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Right after the show is over, I'm going to download that sucker in HD so she can see it.

1512
01:36:11,112 --> 01:36:12,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have it in HD already.

1513
01:36:13,533 --> 01:36:15,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Apple.com.

1514
01:36:15,594 --> 01:36:16,174
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Apple.

1515
01:36:16,674 --> 01:36:18,254
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they have it on Apple's site, don't they?

1516
01:36:18,274 --> 01:36:18,875
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not on Apple.

1517
01:36:18,975 --> 01:36:19,175
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1518
01:36:19,195 --> 01:36:19,935
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on Yahoo.

1519
01:36:19,995 --> 01:36:20,335
[SPEAKER_03]: You lie.

1520
01:36:20,908 --> 01:36:21,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't lie.

1521
01:36:21,668 --> 01:36:31,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so, speaking of the trailer, apparently there was some interesting stuff shown during the trailer between the 37 second and 39 second mark on there.

1522
01:36:32,112 --> 01:36:37,194
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a frame that shows Sector 7 Org at the top and Takara 83 at the bottom.

1523
01:36:39,091 --> 01:36:46,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently, that if you go to Sector7.org and enter in Takara83, it starts an ARG.

1524
01:36:46,836 --> 01:36:51,839
[SPEAKER_03]: So a brand new alternate reality game tied in with the Transformers thing, a new viral campaign.

1525
01:36:51,999 --> 01:36:56,462
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you solve it, you get forwarded to All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com.

1526
01:36:56,522 --> 01:36:57,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that amazing?

1527
01:36:57,302 --> 01:36:58,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that'd be funny.

1528
01:36:58,663 --> 01:37:02,706
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but it's a brand new start, so definitely worth checking out, I guess.

1529
01:37:03,906 --> 01:37:05,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty.

1530
01:37:05,187 --> 01:37:07,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I'd like to also mention, you know, just the kind of,

1531
01:37:08,524 --> 01:37:11,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Start the show the way I ended it, or end the show the way I started it.

1532
01:37:13,468 --> 01:37:20,854
[SPEAKER_03]: 1UP is reporting Earth Defense Force 2017 is coming to the U.S., and I do believe I mentioned that on an earlier podcast.

1533
01:37:21,094 --> 01:37:22,935
[SPEAKER_04]: So humble, the great and humble Loki.

1534
01:37:24,617 --> 01:37:25,918
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's it.

1535
01:37:26,118 --> 01:37:29,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only a one-part show tonight, because the holiday and the pre-tape and everything.

1536
01:37:29,581 --> 01:37:32,783
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1537
01:37:33,003 --> 01:37:33,904
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll start tonight.

1538
01:37:33,964 --> 01:37:34,985
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is...

1539
01:37:35,632 --> 01:37:39,714
[SPEAKER_04]: January 22nd and Heroes returning to TV.

1540
01:37:39,774 --> 01:37:40,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.

1541
01:37:41,776 --> 01:37:42,436
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too long.

1542
01:37:43,577 --> 01:37:46,719
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I have some Kiefer Sutherland to hold me over.

1543
01:37:46,739 --> 01:37:48,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me know when my man is on that show so I can come watch it.

1544
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,241
[SPEAKER_04]: He's supposed to be on the first episode.

1545
01:37:50,301 --> 01:37:52,162
[SPEAKER_04]: So when is that?

1546
01:37:52,282 --> 01:37:54,443
[SPEAKER_04]: January 22nd, so you better watch the first 11 before that.

1547
01:37:54,483 --> 01:37:55,003
[SPEAKER_07]: What night is that?

1548
01:37:55,484 --> 01:37:55,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Monday.

1549
01:37:57,045 --> 01:37:57,485
[SPEAKER_07]: I have school.

1550
01:37:57,745 --> 01:37:58,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you.

1551
01:37:59,706 --> 01:38:02,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the eighth day, the Lord gave us TiVo.

1552
01:38:03,539 --> 01:38:05,040
[SPEAKER_07]: I need new lungs and reject false icons Loki?

1553
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:06,621
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is I'm not buying any more Ubisoft games

1554
01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:28,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get somebody from that company on the show so bad.

1555
01:38:28,091 --> 01:38:29,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a one-on-one with Loki.

1556
01:38:30,032 --> 01:38:30,332
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1557
01:38:30,873 --> 01:38:34,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.

1558
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:35,595
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate it.

1559
01:38:35,615 --> 01:38:37,636
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys keep it alive and keep us going here.

1560
01:38:38,497 --> 01:38:39,977
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't wait to head into 2007.

1561
01:38:40,478 --> 01:38:41,778
[SPEAKER_04]: We got one more show for you guys.

1562
01:38:41,798 --> 01:38:43,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a wacky show next week.

1563
01:38:43,959 --> 01:38:49,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, next week or the week after, one of those shows, we're going to be celebrating our second year, or I should say,

1564
