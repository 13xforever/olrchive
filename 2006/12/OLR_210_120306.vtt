Tonight, December 3rd, 2006

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Do corporate shuffles at Sony tell us the future of PS3?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Halo 3 releases beta information

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And did Capcom finally list the complaints on small text?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
You download them, you go, why was I so into this?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Some of the later Bonk titles were good.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah, maybe that's what it is, but the first one was not that great.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
There's just no point, though, because honestly, everything that's on Virtual Console right now, I have.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
But isn't it nice to just have it all right there?

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
I didn't have it to a graphics, I didn't have a Genesis, so...

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Well, half of the fun for me, and this whole reason why I'm not as much into emulators either,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
is because I just like hooking up the system and playing it.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
You know, I like the whole having the right controller in my hand, and...

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
So, if something comes up on the Virtual Console that was really rare that I don't have...

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Like, say that they put, oh, a panorama cotton on...

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Yeah, good luck. Good luck.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
That's what I'm saying. You know, then maybe I will download something.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
I see. Well, maybe you could start a petition.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I want them to put Guardian Legend on Virtual Console.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Okay, I would download Guardian Legend.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
You know what I don't understand is why it's taking them so long to put these super Virtual Console games on there.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
I think it's one of those things where they're trying to spread it out to make it look like, hey, new stuff every week.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Kind of like how Microsoft does.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
You know, they're sitting on a few arcade games, and they only release the one a week, or whatever.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
I imagine they go through the same QA process as most of their other games go through, and all that other stuff.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
So, they probably have certification, all that crap.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
So, they probably are just testing to make sure the games actually work.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
You know, because backwards compatibility issues that you've heard on other systems,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
maybe they're just making sure there's no bugs.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Maybe if you wait long enough between games, you'll buy the crappy ones.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
I don't know. Well, my thought, okay, probably when the Metroid game comes out on Wii,

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
is when old-school Metroid will be available, and so on.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
You know, they're probably going to do little things like that.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
But it is very strange.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Where's Excitebike, then?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
It is very, yeah, it's true.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
It is very strange that Japan's launch is, like, Uber, if you look at their Virtual Console lineup.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
I mean, they got Castlevania IV, and, like, a bunch of stuff I would really want.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
Like, if they had Castlevania IV on Virtual Console, I'd be buying that shit right now.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Totally.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
So...

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Which I don't understand.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
I mean, like, I have GameTap on the PC, and you can play the first three Castlevanias there, and other stuff.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
You know, but I don't know what it is about the TV, and the sound system, and the Wi-

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
I'd love to curl up on the couch and play.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
To be honest, I want the original games.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
You know, like, games that they're making specifically for the Virtual Console.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
That's what I would like to see, instead of this retro stuff, because I really just don't care too much.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
And I bought Zelda, I bought Super Mario 64.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Have I played them?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah, like, twice.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
And that's it.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
I'm done with them already.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I'd do that for some titles.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Like, SimCity, I played once or twice, and that was it.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
I bought, like, five Virtual Console games.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I bought SimCity Mario Brothers, which was-

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I even- I'm teasing myself.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Rob, you're so stupid for buying Mario Brothers.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
It's been on, like, every single Game Boy Advance version of Mario,

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
but it really is, like, one of my favorite 80s arcade games they ever put out, was the old-school Mario Brothers.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
I have a lot of memories of that as a kid, so maybe there's something to be said there.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
But I bought those two, I bought Bonk, Zelda, and Sonic.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
And I still want to get, like, Golden Axe.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
And I'm going, Rob, why not just get that stupid Genesis collection on PS2 instead of buying these Virtual Console games?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I don't know, I can't stop.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
It's an addiction.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Addict.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Maybe I keep hoping they're going to add multiplayer later on, I don't know.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Well, they said that they're going to be updating the Virtual Console games.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
That's implied.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I don't think anyone in Nintendo said that.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
That's implied from what they're seeing as the options on the Virtual Console.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
When you go in there, you know, you can select the game and there's an option to update the game if there's one available.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
So people are implying that, but nothing's been said, as far as I know.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Well, anyway.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
Outside of Virtual Console games, Trauma Center, second opinion on Wii.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Now, see, understand I never played the DS1, so this is all new to me.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
Graphically, the game is not so hot, but the game itself is so great.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
The operation and everything, the Wii is awesome for a game like that, so I'm having fun with that.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
And then I've been watching my roommate play Excite Truck.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
You guys know Eczema, right?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
He is obsessed with Excite Truck.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
In fact, he's playing it now.

17:10.000 --> 17:17.000
He's gotten all the Excite and Super Excite and everything, and he's working on Mirror Mode right now, which I guess is in the game, too.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
He's working on getting Mirror Mode.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
He's getting S's in Super Excite.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Oh my gosh, this is crazy.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Like, every time I come home, there's Excite Truck going...

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
I found a fun peripheral for that.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
What?

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
They have an actual wheel attachment for the Wiimote.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Oh, the GT game.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Won't work with Excite Truck.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Really?

17:33.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah, because you see Excite Truck, you have to keep the controller flat, and then you turn it, you know, so that you tilt it on that axis.

17:40.000 --> 17:47.000
However, the wheel has it, you know, facing the top of the, you know, basically away the wrong direction.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
I think you can, I think that'll work in Excite Truck, though.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
I think, because I seem to remember E3, that's how I was playing it.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
I have to go back and find that video or picture of me playing E3, but at E3, that's how I was playing it.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Because I thought that's how you were supposed to hold it, was out.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
Like, where the, not where the controller's lying flat, but where the controller's facing you, and I think it still worked.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
It does a little bit, but not how it's supposed to be.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
No wonder I sucked hard at E3.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
You could do it like the teacup ride, you know, have it flat down.

18:13.000 --> 18:21.000
But the thing is, that peripheral would suck when it comes to playing the actual game, because you can't really reach the buttons very easily.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Well, and to be honest, why would you buy it?

18:24.000 --> 18:30.000
I mean, there was a gimmick to sell those two really, really old games, which have been reviewed very poorly,

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
and they're just ports of old games, and they're throwing this tacked-on controller because it's neat.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Ooh, you get a steering wheel attachment! Ooh!

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
And you can actually buy it by itself for $15, which I don't know why you'd want to spend the money for it, but whatever.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Because I just can't imagine this as a steering wheel.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
I just need something to, you know, do the imagining for me.

18:51.000 --> 18:57.000
As far as other games I've been playing, back over to the 360, I have been playing a little bit of Phantasy Star Universe.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I had to check out the new stuff when they added it.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
And Burger King games, I actually checked out as well.

19:02.000 --> 19:09.000
You know, they're all stupid, but considering the fact that they cost, you know, kind of less than an arcade game,

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
I mean, you have to buy the value meal, so the games aren't really four bucks.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
The games are like eight bucks with food, you know, type thing.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
So, but whatever. It's still a pretty decent value, all things considered.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
And, you know, the games, you know, I think Sneak King was my favorite, as I imagine most people.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
All very creepy, though.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
And Pocket Bite Racer, not so much. Wasn't feeling that one.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Big Bumpin' is somewhere in the middle.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Big Bumpin' is pretty easy to pick up and go, but...

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I hear it's great on live.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
I bet, yeah. I might have to check that out on live while I'm stealing your copies of those,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
and try to get some of those achievements and what have you, but...

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Super easy achievements for some of them.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Really? I don't know.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Well, you got one from getting stuck on a wall.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
I played like two courses on that Pocket Bite Racer before I kind of got fed up with it,

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
and I already had gotten like 30 points in achievements for doing nothing.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
So it was interesting.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
I'm not the achievement point whore you are, though, Logie.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Maybe a little bit.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Let's see, what else?

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Lastly, I would say I've been playing Viva Pinata.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I picked up last night.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
It's interesting.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
It's not what I thought it would be.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
I mean, they told me, you know, it's kind of like The Sims and stuff,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
but I don't know. I had something else pictured in my mind,

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
but there's a lot that goes on in that game at once.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I don't know if it's just because I've been moving pretty fast,

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
but if I was a kid, I'd be so lost in that game right now,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I wouldn't be able to keep up with it.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
But it seems like things are happening so fast,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
and I kind of keep wondering if I'm playing the game right,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
but, you know, I'll just kind of keep at it.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
So I'm having fun, and it's kind of cute,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
and I like being able to name the creatures

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
because I've been giving them all X-rated names

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
and then watching them do the mating dance or whatever they do.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And there's some cute creatures in there,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
and it's definitely better than the cartoon.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
The best part was the beginning of the game

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
when you first got the shovel,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
and I suggested that we hit the woman that kept talking.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Oh, yeah, the little guy.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Yeah, if you keep whacking her with the shovel,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
she's like, if you do that one more time, you're going to be sorry.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
And so I whacked her again with the shovel,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
because there's actually like a little animation,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
like she goes, ah, ah, ah.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Like, don't hit me with the shovel.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
And then you hit her enough times just to say,

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
if you do that again, you're going to be sorry.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And then she takes away your shovel.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
And she casts a little spell, and she takes away your shovel.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
And you're kind of screwed.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Like, you have to have a shovel in that game

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
to clear places for the house to go.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
So I had to like reset completely.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
And Matt was just laughing the whole time.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Because it's fun to hit things with shovels.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
There's actually, I hope you don't mind,

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
there's one other thing I forgot.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
What's that?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
The dance playing.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Okay, I'm done pretty much.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
That was it.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Bookworm Adventure.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Bookworm Adventure?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Yeah.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I read stories on the internet about Bookworm Adventure.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Isn't that one of those like casual games,

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
like PopCap type games?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
It's for kids.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah?

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
But it's funny, because Dan's like,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
this is actually getting challenging.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Well, maybe kids and my coworkers.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Because of tons of people at work,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
I walk around and I see them playing, you know,

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
whether it be Bejeweled or Zuma or, what's that other one?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I've been playing Bejeweled on my cell phone.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Collapse.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Well, it's funny, while I was putting on my shoes

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
to come over this morning,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I was looking at watching Dan play the game,

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
and it sort of makes me think of sort of like Scrabble almost,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
how you form your words out of the letters you're given.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
But Dan's like, I have the XY sword,

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
so if I use a word with an X or a Y, I do triple damage.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I'm like, okay.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Oh, he needs to get xylophone,

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
because then he'd have both.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I don't think there'd be enough letters

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
pulled up for xylophone.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Whatever.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
But the longer the word you spell

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
out of the letters you're given,

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
the more damage you do,

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
and he'd like beat up a lion,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
and it had blood and everything.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Interesting.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Where can you check that out?

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Do you know?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I actually do not,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
but I will find out for our listeners next week.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Sounds good.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
All right, a little bit of housekeeping.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
This week will only be a one-part show.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I know you guys are probably really ticked off,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
because we weren't even here last week,

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
but I'm out of town tomorrow night on our usual live time,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
and because of that, Dark Sakura made other plans,

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
and I'm sure Loki's going to,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
well, I don't know what he's going to do.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
He'll do something as well.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
So, sorry, but we'll be back live next week for sure,

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
and we'll do some fun stuff.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Maybe we'll do like a giveaway or something

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
to make up for us being kind of spotty the past couple weeks.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Oh, sorry, you won't be here next week, will you?

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
Yeah, I'm going to be at Disneyland.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Well, shoot.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Well, Loki and I will be live,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
and we'll have some type of special guest.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
I will call.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Okay.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
I will call.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
And give us the report.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Yeah.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
All right.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
I'm going to check out the arcade at Disneyland.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
We have some website changes coming up,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
just some little minor things.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
We've put some live show status thing on our main website,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
so for those of you guys that keep tabs of our spinoff shows,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
because we do many live shows during the week here

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
on Orange Launch Radio,

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
you can keep status of what shows are being live this week

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
and what's in reruns and all that.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
You can see that right on the main page.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
And our news feed's going to be going through

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
some big changes this week as well,

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
so stay tuned for that,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
because we haven't been posting a lot on our site lately,

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
we realize, so we're trying to change our approach

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
to how we're doing website updates,

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
and we think it's going to be successful.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
We're going to take a lot of the stuff

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
that we originally conceptualized for our stuff blog,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
and we're going to somewhat dismantle,

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
I don't want to say dismantle the stuff blog,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
but we're not going to really update the stuff blog anymore,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
because it wasn't really being updated anyway,

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
but we're going to take a lot of those ideas

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
and instead put them on the main website.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
So stay tuned to orangelaunchradio.com,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
and we hope you like what you see.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Also a lot of new forums coming to our website soon.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
You'll see what that's all about pretty soon.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Also, speaking of the live station,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
we had a brand new show debut last week,

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
it's called STFU, and it's a gaming show,

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
and right now it's airing live only on Thursdays

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
at 7 o'clock Pacific with DMN and DJ Tyrant,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
and I heard the first episode was very well received,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
so check it out.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
We are looking into an audio archive or podcast,

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
whatever you want to call it, for that program.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
More to come on that on end of 2007.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
As well as Travis Donovan live is alive and kicking.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
If you're into sci-fi, Travis, Saturday nights at 7,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
good times, good times.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
Also, there's other things being worked on for next year,

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
so keep an ear, I guess, to your computer speaker

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
or whatever you listen to us do.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Absolutely, and if you have an idea for a show,

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
if you think you can do better, let's hear it.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Send us an email, and we're open to new suggestions

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
for new shows always.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
That's how DMN and DJ Tyrant did it.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
We're open to new experiences.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
That's right.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
We're open to experimentation.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
All right, that being said, let's get on into the gaming news.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
It's been forever.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
I have some news.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
All right, Dark Soccer.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
This makes me laugh.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Start us off.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
What's up?

25:36.000 --> 25:42.000
Well, Ken Kutaragi has been moved to CEO of SCEI,

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Sony Computer Entertainment.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
You mean Crayon Eating Officer?

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
Yes, Crayon Eating Officer.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
He is now the man in charge.

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
Kaz Hirai is heading over to Tokyo to do the world group,

25:56.000 --> 26:03.000
and the co-CEO of Sony America, Jack Trenton,

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
is going to take Kaz Hirai's place

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
and is actually going to be the first American

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
to hold that position in the company.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
So that's actually pretty cool.

26:11.000 --> 26:17.000
But I've seen speculation since I first found the information,

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
and actually I want to thank our buddy Rob Way

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
for sending me some of the first information on it, too.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
I think the whole reason they're doing that is,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
well, you done screwed this up.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
You go sit in the office and eat some crayons there.

26:33.000 --> 26:40.000
I think that he's got a broader vision, I think,

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
or maybe that's what they're thinking.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Well, it's weird because I've seen this story approached in two ways.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
I've seen it approached as, oh, this is a downgrade for him.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Even though he's moving to a CEO position,

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
he's being moved because the Sony PlayStation 3 launch has been botched.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
The PSP is not doing as well as it should have.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
But I've also seen it reported as, this is a promotion.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
He's going to be a CEO.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
That's a big title.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
It depends.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
How much of a Sony fanboy or a Kudaragi fanboy are you?

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
That's how you're going to interpret this, I suppose.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
Now, I'm going to take this from being that you've been in the same.

27:14.000 --> 27:20.000
We've all been working for various corporations over our off-radio career.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
But looking at this from a very upper management point of view,

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
I think that they see he's this public figure.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
He's done really good through here as far as they think.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
He could still do a benefit, but his vision is not what we need for this.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
He has ruined this.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
We do not need him on a focused thing.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
We need him on the big picture.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
I kind of agree.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
I think when something's broken, you fix it,

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
and I think there is that perception that PlayStation 3 and PSP could be doing better.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Well, it's hard to say.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
PlayStation 3, obviously, it's selling out on shelves, yes,

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
but not nearly as many as there should have been.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Certainly, it's made its way into pop culture,

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
but I think Sony had hoped to push more out by the end of the year

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
than they're realistically going to.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
All this eBay profiteering stuff, whatever.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
But since he has done a lot of good for the company previously,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
I think they're just doing this shuffle to just try something

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
and put some new ideas in there.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
So I think it's just them trying a different approach.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I don't necessarily think it's good or bad.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
It's just different.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
They want to go somewhere different.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
I've seen similar things happen with the company that I work for.

28:27.000 --> 28:33.000
I've seen people who I just thought were a total botch on their management jobs

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
go into VP positions and just soar.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
I think as far as anything business related,

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
everyone's going to have their talents,

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
everyone's going to have their strong points here and there,

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
and where I still think that Kudaragi is probably a big old stupid, stupid,

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
no common sense person, he's there for a reason.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
He's made it as far as he has for a reason.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
PlayStation 2 did kick ass.

28:58.000 --> 29:06.000
And I think that they're trying to save an asset that has proved beneficial to them in the past.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
All right.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
Loki, any thoughts on the whole corporate reshuffle?

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
I don't know.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
Hopefully if putting him in a position that he has more authority, I guess,

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
will cause him to shut up more.

29:20.000 --> 29:27.000
It would be most beneficial in Sony's eyes.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
He just needs to shut up.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
If he's good at running the company, great, run the company.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
But just stop having him spout off stupid stuff because he's just...

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
Well, I think a lot of Sony management in general has been accused of being cocky

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
and all that other crap through this whole thing.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
So I don't see this as one guy's problem

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
because the guy in Europe wouldn't shut his mouth either and all this other stuff.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Well, here's what it is to me.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
It seems like the higher up you get,

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
I mean, granted, in the beginning you brought the company to where it needs to be.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
You pretty much know your job.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
You know how to do it.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
But once you get so high up, you're hands off on a lot of it.

30:14.000 --> 30:20.000
And so you kind of lose face where how stuff actually happens.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
And pretty soon you become out of touch with how that company is actually running.

30:23.000 --> 30:29.000
And so you start spouting off crazy shit and it's actually not realistic.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Well, moving on to something that I thought was kind of interesting

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
that kind of happened because of this.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
This has been spreading like wildfire through blogs.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
And you'll see this headline on all these game blogs,

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
PlayStation 4 is dead, PlayStation 4 not happening,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
PlayStation 3, Sony's last console.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
And it pretty much boils down to this quote coming from Yuta Sakurai,

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
who is an analyst at Nomura Holdings, who is talking about all this change.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
He says, the appointment of Sakurai could be a start of shift from hardware to software.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
I cannot now imagine a PlayStation 4

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
because Sakurai has previously been focused on software at Sony

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
and so they're reading into this move is that Sony's going to move back into software.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
And I can't help but think to myself, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, put the car in park.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
This guy is some analyst for some company.

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
I don't know why these analyst quotes always seem to make game blogs.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
I mean, they're speculating just like any other fan is.

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
Sure, they get paid to maybe analyze statistics and sales and all that stuff,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
but you guys are gamers.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
You know how to analyze this stuff just as easily as these guys get paid the big bucks.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
You guys know that it comes down to the good games.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
And I'm thinking people are running way too far with this quote.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
It's way too early to tell if Sony is going to ditch a PlayStation 4.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
Come on, PlayStation 3 is still a baby.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
What did they say?

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
To go ahead and quote, it was actually their U.S. spokesperson, Dave Cracker,

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
is on GameSpot, but I got my information from Eurogamer.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
To quote, following the launch of PlayStation 3 just a few weeks ago

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
and witnessing the huge consumer demand for the product,

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
I think it would be rather short-sighted for anyone to predict

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
there might not be a next generation of PlayStation product.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
Wow, that's one of the first smart things that Sony said in a long time.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
I wouldn't exactly say huge demand. Okay, great.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
You sold out of all the units that you produced.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Hooray for you.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
What do you call the eBay profiteering?

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
Because they know that it's not based on Sony's product being uber great.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
It's because, oh, look, I made lots of money on the 360 last year.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
Look, there's a similar situation where there's not going to be enough consoles

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
and people want them, so we're going to sell them for a lot of money.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
People are spending a buttload of money on those PlayStation 3s, though.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
That's the demand they're talking about.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
Because little Billy whines and wants, I want my PlayStation 3,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
and then little Billy's parents will buy it.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Well, little Billy should go do the dishes.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
Well, Hooray also was bringing up the PS4 himself,

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
talking about future plans,

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
and there was also discussion about them going into an electronic distribution

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
for games in the future.

33:03.000 --> 33:08.000
I'm sorry, but they should not even be talking PlayStation 4 right now.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Make the PlayStation 3 work first.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
Focus on, you know, maybe they do need to put a guy on the software side there.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
Put out some better software for PlayStation 3.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
What's the number one complaint been about this launch?

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
Their launch titles blow, except for maybe Resistance.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
However, and I'm trying to see it from their point of view, too,

33:26.000 --> 33:31.000
if they don't start thinking about the next generation of system now,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
everybody else is going to be ahead of them.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Thinking about it and talking about it are two different things.

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
Yeah, but granted, though, this console is supposed to have a 10-year life cycle,

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
whereas the other ones are only five years.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
So why are they concerned about the console now?

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
Are they going back on their word again?

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I mean, woo, that'd be a shocker.

33:48.000 --> 33:54.000
But really, if you're going to believe that there's going to be no PlayStation 4

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
when Microsoft announces the next Xbox,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
they're definitely going to announce the next PlayStation.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Bingo.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I think that it actually,

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
I think the focus should be on the current system now that it's out,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
but I think that it's still good,

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
because as long as you've got the money to pay for the team of specialists,

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
then do it.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
You have your little team of specialists that are working away on it,

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
but they're in a closed room that we don't talk about,

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
because for me, if they were to come out and say,

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
oh, we've already got this PlayStation 4 thing in the works,

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
to me that's them saying, oh, well, the PlayStation 3 is fucked.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
And I'm just going to say, well, I guess I ain't going to get one

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
because they're already working on 4.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Remember the Gizmondo?

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
Oh, yeah, by the way, even though our Gizmondo hasn't launched yet,

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
we've got the widescreen version in the works,

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
so it has to be like announcing the DS Lite when the DS comes out.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
Or my question is, how come Nintendo gets away with this shit?

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
Because they just announced the Wii DVD thing,

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
but again, it's not a big deal.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
It's going to be more expensive than who gives a shit.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
It's like saying, oh, look, it plays CDs now.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
Oh, goody, let me go run out and get another CD player.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Oh, wait, no, I don't need one because I have 60,000 of them.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
We also know Wiis are going to come out in different colors at some point

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
depending on what we saw at E3.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
You get them in different colors now.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
They have sites that will do custom paint jams and things like that.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
That's different.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I'm talking about officially licensed Nintendo pink Wiis.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Oh, big deal.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
You want a pink Wii?

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Yes.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Are you going to play with it?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Is that so wrong?

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
Yes, that's actually very wrong.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I just think it's interesting.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Even better if you get a Bluey.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
It's just interesting.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Nintendo gets away with things sometimes

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
that other people are critical of other companies about,

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
and it's fascinating to me.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
And even I'm guilty of it, too.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
But because they're Nintendo, we let them get away with it.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I don't know.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Well, it comes down to games.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
It comes down to games.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
But, you know, Sony's always going back on their word and stuff,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
and even now they're still insisting that they're going to ship

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
one million PlayStation 3 consoles by the end of this year.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Well, you know what?

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
I don't think so.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
I mean, even Electronic Arts' Larry Prose was basically telling

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
Reuters that they only shipped out about 200,000 units,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
if that, on the initial launch for the United States,

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
even though they were saying,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
oh, yeah, we're going to have half a million units

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
or 600,000 units.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Yeah, they didn't really meet those numbers,

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
and kind of speculating on that,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
they're probably only going to hit about half a million

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
to 800,000 by the end of the year.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Makes sense to me.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I mean, they've already underestimated

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
or overestimated the amount of units

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
that are going to be out there,

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
and I just don't think they can produce them fast enough,

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
especially if they start running into problems like

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
Microsoft had with, you know, units overheating

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
or, you know, some sort of hardware glitch.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
AKA, be very careful about the first batch of any new console.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
Well, given the run of first batch PlayStation 2s,

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
the just massive amounts of problems that they had,

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
on top of that, I think one of the big problems with the PS2

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
is that it was not really meant to be used as a primary DVD player,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
which a lot of people were getting it for,

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
and the systems would burn out, the first models.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
I'm actually still surprised that my first model Japanese one still works.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
Well, yeah, I mean, what's also good, though,

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
is Nintendo is still saying that they're ahead of schedule,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
and they're going to be shipping out the units that they promised,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
so that's good.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
At least those launches, I know in Japan,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
certainly weren't delayed,

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
and they had enough units out there, so, you know,

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
I think what it comes down to is UK is, you know,

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
patiently waiting and saying,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
okay, are we actually going to get our launch in March?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
I mean, when we do have a launch,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
exactly how many units is a launch?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I mean, here's your one unit.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Please share.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
I don't know, I, you know,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
we have a lot of folks over in the UK who listen to us,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
and of course we're thankful for that,

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
and appreciate that you guys listen to us.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I can't help but think, you know,

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
you guys really aren't missing that much.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
You're really not.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
I understand.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
Maybe you want the cheap Blu-ray player or whatever it is,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
but, you know, I don't have one either right now.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
I don't even really want one.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Does a European listener maybe want to send me money?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I'll buy you one here and send you one.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
No, you can't even get them here.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
I wouldn't be able to do that.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
You can't ship them either.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Yeah, because of the lockdown.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Oh, geez.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Enclosed.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Form and grill.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Geez, geez, geez.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Put it in a form and grill box.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
What you need to do is you need to ship it to another country,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
and in that country, someone there has to, you know,

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
pretty much walk across.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
It's not worth it.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
It's not.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
Is resistance that good, Jamie?

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
Is resistance that good?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
No, not really.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Then there you go.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
It's not worth it.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Just buy Call of Duty 3 and the 360.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
It's about the same.

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
Resistance is pretty, and I do like shooting things in the head,

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
but I can shoot things in the head in other games,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
like Resident Evil 4.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
Shoot them in the head.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
All right.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
This ain't a cut scene.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Press A.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
If I press A, it'll type over our show thing.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
Anyway, so remember how all the fun that we were talking about,

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
Gran Turismo HD, and how it was just a big, you know, blown up,

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
you know, HD version of Gran Turismo 4?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
And how the people looked like cardboard cutouts.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
How the game was going to cost $700 after you bought all the cars.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
Well, it's actually going to be a free demo now at the PlayStation store.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
It'll be out so far only for Japan.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
Be out on the 24th of December.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Gran Turismo HD concept.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
It will have ten cars, two layouts of a single track,

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
at least according to what Yamauchi said, the designer.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
It has Time Attack, Drift Trial, Network Ranking,

39:39.000 --> 39:45.000
and they're also, I think, putting more focus, though,

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
on GT5 when it's out, which is actually slated for 2008.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Not bad for free, though.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
That's a nice price reduction from, you know, $900 or whatever

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
we were joking about to free.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Yay for Sony. Good job.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
I think someone finally stepped in, you know, like an analyst or something,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
one of the guys that they have working for the company,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
and they go, you actually think this is going to work?

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Because this is not going to work.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
The Internet hates you right now.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Maybe you need to try something different.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
Yeah, but here's the thing, though.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
We're not certain, though, what Gran Turismo 5 is going to be,

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
and they could very well do something like this,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
you know, kind of meeting in the middle ground

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
and having, you know, a decent amount of cars,

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
you know, say like, I don't know, 60 or something,

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
and you still have to buy 500 other cars online.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
So we don't know about that yet, but, I mean,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
when you're advertising the game as a tech demo on E3,

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
and then you're all, oh, by the way, it's not a tech demo, that's a full game,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
and we want you to buy it for 50 bucks.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
Oh, by the way, it doesn't come with any cars.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
I'm sorry, that's just, that's their same logic as saying,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
oh, you'd buy a Sony PlayStation 3 if there weren't any games.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
I think PR just kind of botched the project.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
I agree with the concept that, you know what, just make Gran Turismo 5.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
Shut up and make 5.

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
All right, anyway, we don't know if that'll be coming to the U.S. yet, do we?

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
I don't know. I just said Japan only right now, but I would suspect so.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Yeah, make sense.

41:12.000 --> 41:17.000
I would kind of hope so, because I think it actually would be a nice apology.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Something, now, you know it would be...

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
We're sorry, here's a game.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
You want to talk about a Geometry Wars killer for the online?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I mean, that's not a bad deal.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
There's a lot of racing game fans who'd get a kick out of that, so maybe.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
Anyway, let's talk about what you can get over the counter in Japan pretty soon

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
with some Japanese release dates coming out on the Xbox 360 on December 7th.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Blue Dragon, which is a big, big, big title for Japan,

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
and so it'll be interesting to see how the game does

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
and how many systems are sold in the next week.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
It'll be kind of interesting to see what effect that has on Japan.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, not a lot.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
You don't really get any more games until you get Armored Core 4 on the 14th.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Same thing with the Wii.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Since you guys just had your system launch this week,

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
you're not going to get a whole lot of new titles until, again, December 14th

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
when you get Pokemon Battle Revolution

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
and the Japanese version of Rayman Raving Rabbids.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
But if you're a PS2 fan still, you got a lot of games coming out.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
You got Devil Summoner is coming out,

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
Ace Combat Zero both on the 7th,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Suikoden 5, Gensou Suikoden 5,

42:21.000 --> 42:27.000
as well as Momotaru Densetsu 16 from Hudson,

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
and Taiko no Tatujin for our music game fans.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
That's coming out.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
Taiko no Tatujin Bang Tap, Tomori 7 Daimei,

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
both a drum controller version and the standalone version coming out.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
And if you're a Tomb Raider fan in Japan,

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
Tomb Raider Legend on the PlayStation 2 on December 7th as well.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
If you are a Nintendo DS person,

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
there's quite a few games also coming out over there on December 7th.

42:52.000 --> 42:59.000
Several games from Media Works called DS Dendeki Bunko,

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
which I'm guessing might be a translation of the dice game.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
I have no idea.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
Also, DS Puzzler coming from TDK Media Active,

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
and Cinema Roll.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Hey, that's Sanrio.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Yeah, coming from Bandai.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Is it the same one?

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Oh, it sure is.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Yeah.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
So check out that one.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I don't have any silly title games this week,

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
but I like Cinema Roll,

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
so maybe that'll be my must-checkout title of the week.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Hey, if you're a PSP fan,

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
Mahjong and Parappa the Rappa this week, December 7th.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Hell yeah.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
That's right.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Check that out.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
You gotta believe.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
We have two Cinema Roll...

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Was it Pillows?

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Remember the...

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Oh yeah.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
Went to the Sanrio outlet.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Yeah?

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
I need more Batsumaru stuff.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
I want the Batsumaru guitar so bad.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
So bad.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
All right.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Anyway...

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Actually...

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Whatever.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
We don't want to turn into Sanrio.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
I think the Batsumaru one is a bass, though.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Anyways...

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
So...

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Sorry, guys.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
I was busy playing Hello Kitty World.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Anyways...

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
So, to start off, of course, our release dates.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
We've got some stuff that you might not have heard about yet,

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
including some dates for some brand new Wii titles.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
Mario Party 8 for the Wii, coming out March 6th.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
Has that even been announced that Mario Party's in the...

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
I mean...

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Duh, but...

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
Yeah, there's been video...

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Okay, that's good.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Either...

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
I can't remember.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Space World or Tokyo Game Show.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
I don't remember.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I've never seen it, though.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Wario Master of Disguise for the DS,

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
also coming out on the 6th of March.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
Wii Plays coming through the United States on the 21st of January,

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
including the bundle with the remote.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
Actually, it is only bundled with the remote.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
There's going to be some stuff coming out...

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
Actually, a new Spyro game is in the works right now.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Still working titles.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Spyro 2007.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Obviously, it's not going to be Spyro 2007.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Spyro Ultimate!

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
It's coming out on August 15th of next year.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
It's going to be on PlayStation 2, the Wii, DS, Game Boy Advance, and PSP.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
This one, I hope, is the working title.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
Crash Jackin' 07.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
That's for PlayStation 2, the 360.

45:10.000 --> 45:15.000
Wii, DS, Game Boy Advance, and PSP also come out on August 15th.

45:15.000 --> 45:20.000
Mommy, for my birthday, I want Crash Jackin' on the Wii.

45:20.000 --> 45:27.000
What's funny is Blazing Angels for the Wii has been delayed to March 14th of next year.

45:27.000 --> 45:34.000
To coincide with the Blazing Angels 2 release on the 360, which is also the same day.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
It's very strange.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
Of course, this next week, we've got some good stuff coming out.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
For the Wii, we have Ice Age 2.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
I said good stuff, so that's not exactly counted in there.

45:46.000 --> 45:54.000
But we do have Far Cry Instinct's Vengeance, I believe, is coming out on the Wii as well.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
That one actually, I heard, is pretty good. It has a good control system in that.

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
So, if you were jaded by Red Steel, you might want to pick that one up instead.

46:01.000 --> 46:08.000
And then, of course, on the 360, we've got Star Trek Legacy, which is going to be pretty good.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
And Rapala Trophies, which is not going to be very good at all.

46:11.000 --> 46:17.000
And on PlayStation 2, one of the only games coming out on PlayStation 2 for December,

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Rayman's Raving Rabbids, finally.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
So, if you don't have a Wii, that's definitely one to pick up.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
On PSP, though, you've got some good stuff.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
Of course, you've got Brothers in Arms D-Day.

46:28.000 --> 46:35.000
And also, on the PlayStation 3, Full Auto 2, which is basically Full Auto 1 with Deathmatch.

46:35.000 --> 46:41.000
And Fight Night Round 3, which is basically Fight Night Round 3 with first-person mode.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
I'm kind of curious about the Star Trek game.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I liked what I saw at E3.

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
I'm not usually a tactical games-type person, but I am a little bit of a Trekkie.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
I liked the whole Borg ship.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Well, I liked how they re-enacted the Erathicon thing.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
That was kind of rad.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
That was fabulous.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I'm tempted to check it out.

46:58.000 --> 47:04.000
The PSP also is getting Star Wars Lethal Alliance, which is that kind of original game for PSP.

47:04.000 --> 47:10.000
So, it's kind of a smorgasbord of stuff to lead for November.

47:10.000 --> 47:18.000
Well, in UK gaming news, actually a bunch of games already came out, but we weren't live to cover it.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
So, I'll just go quickly over that list.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
Sonic Rivals came out, a couple football manager games.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, Viva Pinata, Yoshi's Island.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
Today being the second, actually.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
Tokobot Plus, Mysteries of the Katakuri came out.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
Coming out on the 8th, though, we have Wii Launch.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
So, get your Wii.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, and then give me your friend code.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
So, coming out, we have Barnyard.

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
We have Brothers in Arms D-Day, Call of Duty 3, Cars, Dead or Alive Xtreme 2.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Get that as well.

47:52.000 --> 48:00.000
EA Replay goes to Recon Advanced Warfighter with more acronyms.

48:00.000 --> 48:05.000
Hey, if you guys in the UK are camping out for a Wii, send us some audio.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Talk to some people in line and send us some audio.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
We want to hear from some of the other countries' launches,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
because we played some audio in our last live episode.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
Chris out there at Target interviewing some folks.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I want to hear from some UK people.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
So, I know we've got some listeners out there.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Send me a cassette tape if you have to,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
but make an MP3 somehow and send it to us.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
I want to hear from some British folks that are excited about the launch.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Seriously, just take it out,

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
and then even if you have to Skype it to us through your computer,

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
you can do that, too.

48:34.000 --> 48:38.000
Yeah, you can always call the voicemail, 877-GAME-OLR.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Oh, that's not toll-free in Europe, though, sorry.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
That's why I'm saying take it home and play it through your Skype.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
There you go, there you go.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
You can do audio feed through your Skype.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
That's true, that's true.

48:46.000 --> 48:51.000
Also, though, we have King of Fighters XI.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
If that's the 3D one, I don't know.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
GT Pro Series, Madden 2007, like anyone cares.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
Monster 4x4 World Circuit, Need for Speed Carbon, Open Season,

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
Rampage Total Destruction, Rayman Raving Rabbids for a bunch of stuff,

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
Red Steel, Star Trek Legacy,

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
sorry, tongue tied.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Star Wars Lethal Alliance, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz,

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Superman Returns a Video Game,

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, which is very fun,

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam,

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
which I'm probably, I think, one of five people that likes that game.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
Wii Play, Wii Sports, because, of course, it's the Wii.

49:28.000 --> 49:34.000
And in other notables later on this month is Far Cry Vengeance Sims 2 Pets,

49:34.000 --> 49:38.000
which is actually kind of fun because your pets are on crack.

49:38.000 --> 49:44.000
Actually, Marvel Ultimate Alliance already came out, too, on, I think, PS2.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
On PSP, I'm sorry.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
And that's really it.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
And also, just to go ahead and make a mention,

49:50.000 --> 49:54.000
I am going to try to be focusing at least once a month

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
on some of the other countries that have different release dates.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
So if there's any place in particular that you've found as a reliable source

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
for release dates internationally, let me know.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Send me an email, jamieatorangeholdradio.com.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
Sounds good. And that was kind of inspired by our listener email, wasn't it?

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
It was, which I will be addressing later.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Oh, okay. Then I won't spoil that.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Let's go on back to some news then.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
Let's talk about some things happening here stateside.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Very interesting news report coming out of Chicago.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
The Better Business Bureau is challenging Toys R Us

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
based on what happened at the Wii launch.

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
They were forcing people to buy bundles, essentially what was happening.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Now, keep in mind, this is not nationwide.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
This was a particular store in the area that got a lot of heat for this

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
because I know at other Toys R Uss across the country this wasn't a problem.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Very similar to what happened with Best Buy in the 360.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
Remember how Best Buys in the Northwest were forcing the bundles?

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
Well, Toys R Us was forcing, I believe, the Wii,

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
three games and their warranty thing they had to buy.

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
And this one lady was mad and was arguing with the manager about it,

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
and the Wii sold out while they were arguing about it.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
She was pissed.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
She did one of those consumer call the news things,

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
and now the Better Business Bureau is investigating it.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
And I say good.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
I agree.

51:06.000 --> 51:12.000
I think companies need to be aware that we're not going to tolerate that bullshit bundling stuff.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I don't want your stupid warranty.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
If somebody does, great, they can purchase that.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
You can offer it to me and I can say no, but don't force me to buy it.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
That's messed up.

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
And the games and all that crap, I say good.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
And this isn't necessarily something against Toys R Us

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
because in my mind, reading this story,

51:29.000 --> 51:35.000
this sounds like one manager's or district manager's very piss poor decision

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
that's going to screw the company as a whole thanks to that.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
So I will take great satisfaction in knowing that thanks to this,

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000
that manager or district manager will probably be canned because of this.

51:47.000 --> 51:53.000
And I hope it will be a lesson for other managers and district managers nationwide.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
Don't try to use these big console launches,

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
not that there's going to be another one for quite some time,

51:59.000 --> 52:04.000
but in the future, don't use these big console launches and the consumer demand for them to sell your crap.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Force us to buy your crap.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
So, any other thoughts on that, Loki?

52:09.000 --> 52:13.000
I understand why they did it, but the bait and switch part's not good.

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
The bundling's okay, bait and switch's not good.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Do you think it's okay to force people to buy those bundles?

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
Yeah.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
I don't think so.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
I think it's perfectly fine to do.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
Why?

52:22.000 --> 52:27.000
Because if you saw what the margins were on the systems and the accessories and the games,

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
you would understand why they have to because Nintendo's saying,

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
oh, by the way, all that profit that you want, I ain't going to get it.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
You're going to get a dollar.

52:34.000 --> 52:39.000
But don't you think that logically people are going to buy the games with the system

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
or they're going to buy stuff and if they have a good experience with it about the system,

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
they'll buy their games there?

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
It's about the return business, you know what I mean?

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
If they're going to buy a PlayStation 3 for $2,000 on eBay,

52:49.000 --> 52:55.000
what the hell is going to stop me from selling a PlayStation 3 in a retail store with three games attached to it?

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
You're going to buy it.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
Our target, I don't know if it's just our target or if all of them were doing it.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
I think it was a national thing.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
They handled it very well.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
Instead of forcing somebody into something, because remember,

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
it's the same thing from when you're a little kid.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
You want to do other than what you're being made to do, you know?

53:14.000 --> 53:18.000
That's the biggest part of it is you tell me I have to and I'm like,

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
nuh-uh, I don't have to do shit.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
I don't have to do shit.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
I'm gonna.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Who the hell are you to tell me what I have to do?

53:23.000 --> 53:28.000
Well, the way Target did it, which I was actually very, very, very pleased with this,

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
is they gave you an incentive.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
And true, it wasn't like much of an incentive.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
You get a flashy thing that gives you...

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
Hey, I still have mine.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
It's pretty.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
It is pretty.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Look at that.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
Ooh, it glows blue.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
I can go get one right now.

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
Yeah, Miklotov bought 15 of these with a dollar each on the card.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
They're these little gift cards that glow blue.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I hope you international folks get something similar.

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
I don't know if they even have Target internationally, but they're so pretty.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
I was gonna get one just to have one, you know?

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
You know what, if they don't do this internationally,

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
maybe I'll send this one to one of our international listeners,

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
because they're pretty.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
They're very pretty.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
Yeah, it's awfully cool that they glow blue there,

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
even though the console doesn't seem to.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
Yes, it does.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
When do you get new mail?

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Only when I get new mail.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
Oh, when it runs updates.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Do you want me to send you mail, Loki?

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
No, I can get mail myself.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
But I'm just saying, I want to glow blue all the time.

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
It can pulse blue when I have mail.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
You're picky.

54:23.000 --> 54:28.000
Well, at any rate, I think that we should pick up a couple of them

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
and send some to our overseas listeners if they don't get them.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Yeah, I don't know if Target's overseas or what,

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
so send some emails if you really want it.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
We'll see what we can do.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
Yeah.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
All right.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
With the launches, of course, there's still lots of desire,

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
especially from the Wii.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
Lots of things that we wish they would have done that they didn't do.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
For example, and this is actually...

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
Whose list is this?

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
This isn't my list.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
This is Game Informer's list.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
Okay.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
But I do agree with a lot of it, and a lot of it I do agree with.

54:54.000 --> 54:59.000
Like, for example, accessories component and S-Video cables.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
Where are they?

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
They certainly are sold out and can't seem to find anywhere,

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
so that kind of sucks.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
More virtual console downloads, because, I mean, you know,

55:09.000 --> 55:13.000
12 games is great, but it's not enough.

55:13.000 --> 55:18.000
A wireless sensor bar might be nice, especially if you have a projection TV.

55:18.000 --> 55:23.000
The ability to save GameCube saves to the flash memory cards or SD cards

55:23.000 --> 55:30.000
might be good, especially if you're renting games or never had GameCube stuff.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
Better straps for the wireless Wiimotes.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
Now, I think that's just stupid people letting the controllers go,

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
whatever, but I guess they could be stronger.

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
More user-friendly friends list, and I could definitely agree with that.

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
A wireless classic controller, so it doesn't have to be tethered to the remote there.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
And, of course, you know, redesign the Wavebird,

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
which I don't really understand that part of it, but okay.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
I think they're saying they want, like, a GameCube controller.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
Yeah, I think they want it more like the classic controller.

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
More robust Wiimotes sensor bar calibration, like Zelda,

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
and that was their example, because I guess you can actually set where the bar is,

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
which is kind of neat.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
A music channel, which I'm surprised they didn't have it.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
I mean, a picture channel I don't really get either, but a music channel would...

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I've actually been able to use picture channel,

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
because my phone saves to the micro-SDs, and I have a converter,

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
so I put the SD card in there, and that's how I sent some pictures.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Didn't I send you and Nelly, like, a picture that I doctored?

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
Yeah.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
A picture I took of a stripper, and I drew, like, a fart cloud coming out.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
It was really immature, but it was funny when I sent it.

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
Yeah, but actually I heard that it'll grab stuff off of Bluetooth,

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
so if your phone's Bluetooth, it'll grab it off of there.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
The Bluetooth on my phone's weird.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Okay.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
Anyways, points leftovers, because the Wii points,

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
you have to buy them in $10 increments,

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
and so when you buy something, you're left over some excess points.

56:51.000 --> 56:54.000
Then the 360 guilty of the same thing.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
Yeah.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Whatever.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Anyways, online services...

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I guess that's one thing Sony's doing right,

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
is that they're using real cash, none of the stupid Sony points stuff,

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
you know, good for them.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Online service experience, I guess,

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
you know, there's a lot of trouble connecting to the shops and stuff.

57:11.000 --> 57:15.000
Optical audio out, and I guess I can understand that,

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
because Prologic 2 is okay.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Wireless nunchuck, I don't think so.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
That's another thing that people are going to throw through a window.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Let's see.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Boy, this is a bitch list, isn't it?

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
It is a bitch list.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
Better fleshed out accomplishments list,

57:30.000 --> 57:34.000
because, you know, I guess play history is just not really an accomplishment.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
More control over the blue slot illumination.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
I definitely agree with that one.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Rechargeable battery packs.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
I agree with the achievement thing.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
I can't believe no one copied Microsoft on that whole thing.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
I think it's cute.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I wish they would have done something like that.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
And what was I going to say?

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
The battery packs, I think, are coming,

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
because if you look inside of it,

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
there's actually like a contact where they could have a wireless,

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
like a battery pack for it.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
So that might be something that's on its way.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Better speakers in the Wiimote, because they suck,

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
and I'm actually thinking about taking one apart to replace a speaker in it.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
You're weird.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
We may see that on a future show.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Save games in the Wiimote, which might be cool.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
More customization for the Wii menu.

58:15.000 --> 58:19.000
Game Boy Player, timed demos for every virtual console game,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
because a lot of these games I haven't played,

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
so I don't know if they're crap.

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
Okay, this is turning into just like every little thing that they can think of,

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
you know, they're putting on here that, you know, I don't know.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Probably not as if they haven't already thought of it themselves.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I know, this is getting to be a little much.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Wii Sports in a case, because they got it in a case in...

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
I could agree with that.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
Australia.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
But that is, you know...

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
No ethernet port, which is kind of lame.

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
And this doesn't even have anything to do with it.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
Club Nintendo for the U.S.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
Well, it's cool.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
They get the, like, you know, the points and stuff,

58:53.000 --> 58:58.000
like the DS, was it those games and stuff.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
How hard would it really be for Nintendo to go back and add some of the stuff, though?

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
They have built the updates to be pretty easy.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
They could add the music channel if they wanted.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Yeah, and who says it's not coming later on?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I mean, they said that there's a bunch of surprises,

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
and we'll see some in the next few weeks.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
All right.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
It's not hard.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Oh, we'll see.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
You know what I want?

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
What?

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
I want freaking region free, but no.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
Yeah, they've confirmed it is region locked, the Wii is.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
So...

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
We cry, we cry, and then we import.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Until they make a swap.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
Merely a small obstacle for now.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Now, I heard somebody claim that you can use a boot disk,

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
but then I heard another blogger refute that, so...

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
You can for GameCube games.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
For some games.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
They're saying that, yeah, it doesn't always work.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
I actually, they were saying with an action replay that I have a freeloader,

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
so when I get home, I'll try it with my freeloader.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
See if it works.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
All right.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
We'll see.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Speaking of things being locked away,

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
there was an update to the Wii console this week,

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
and a lot of people were very excited because they were like,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
ooh, maybe I'll have a forecast channel or a news channel to play with,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
or maybe they fixed some of the HD issues or whatever.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
But no, really all the update did was that, you know,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
it said it updated parental controls,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
and then it locked out that whole thing

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
where people were going into the shop channel

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
and turning it into a browser, which was kind of pointless

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
because you couldn't do much with the browser,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
but I think it was just one more of those things

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
where somebody wanted to be able to do it to say they did it.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Well, Nintendo put the smackdown on that.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
You could do it, and they're still working on a way around that, so...

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
It's turning into the PSP now.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
How can we hack away their little, you know,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
and then they'll update, and then, you know,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
somebody finds another hack to get what they want,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
and then they'll update.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
There's PSP all over again.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
It's still going on, so, you know, sooner or later.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
And also the other thing, too,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
is people were able to download virtual console games off of a server,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
so all they have to do is figure out how to encode them

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
and you'd be pirating games off of their servers.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Oh, interesting.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
So, yeah.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
That's probably another reason why they wanted to fix that.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Yeah, Nintendo may be already looking into making sure that doesn't happen.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
We'll see.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Didn't they change, like,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
because you could browse the virtual console stuff on the web,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
but then they changed that where now it's all certificate-based

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
or something like that?

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Yeah, it's all certificate-based,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
and now it checks the IP instead of just the URL,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
but I think people are going to find ways around that.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
It's just a matter of time.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
That's really what it is.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Now, speaking of updates to the virtual console,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
there are going to be some more games coming out on Monday here,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
and some good stuff.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Donkey Kong Jr. for the NES is going to be making its way out there,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
and then on the Genesis we've got Columns, Rizstar,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
and Victory Run for, I believe, the TurboGrafx-16.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
So, not too bad.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I don't know.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I want some more games like...

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Rizstar was Saturn, wasn't it?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
No.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
No, that was...

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Think of another game.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Sorry.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
It was Genesis.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Anyways, I want my Super Mario Brothers, God damn it.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
I want Super Mario World, and I want Kid Icarus.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I want Kid Icarus so bad.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I want it so bad.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I hope that's the one game they're like,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
oh, by the way, for some reason this just wouldn't work with the virtual console.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I will poke Reggie in the eye myself

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
if they can't get Kid Icarus working on the Wii virtual console.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I will drive up to Redman and poke him in the eye.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I want them to emulate Turbo Duo,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
because I want Dracula X.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Dream On.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
No offense, but, I mean, do you think that's high on their priority list right now?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I know it should be.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
No, but it would be very easy.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
It's a freaking Super Nintendo game with real audio, is what it is.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I mean, seriously.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
But, yeah.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
That would be my bit of heaven right there.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I would pay for that.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I mean, so that I don't have to gingerly handle my, you know, CD and go,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
oh, please don't scratch, please don't scratch.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Where's one of the burns of it?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Okay, my burn doesn't work.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Damn.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Because that's what I go through every time I play that game.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
All right.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Well, one other thing Jamie goes through every week is that she likes to open up the mailbag

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
and read some e-mails that you guys send in to us at mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000
and she reads the mails and responds to them right here on our program.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And she's going to do that right now.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Well, the first one comes from someone named Guy.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Actually, apparently one of our listeners from the UK.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Hey, by the way, Guy.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I was kind of mad that you weren't in the Final Fight they put on Super Nintendo until way later.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I just want to point that out because Guy was my favorite.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Sorry, go ahead and read.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I actually have Final Fight Guy.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Read the damn e-mails.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Sorry.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Did I tell you about my Final Fight collection?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I was trying to collect every version of Final Fight.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Dude, they need to put Final Fight Guy on Virtual Console.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I have Final Fight Guy, though.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Anyway, sorry.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
With the box.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
We totally just lost a listener.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Sorry.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Hi.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I don't get why all the movies and games are out in America before.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
In England, is it because America is a bigger financial target?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Thanks, Guy.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
What's your speculation?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000
It's your TVs because they have to convert everything for the other format,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
and I think that's what causes things to get delayed.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Everyone needs to have a HDTV, and then it won't matter.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
So maybe in five years because HDTV is picking up more and more,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
but for right now, yeah, it's your TVs.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Sorry.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I've got my Gorillaz DVDs.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
They're PAL.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I had to run through my laptop into the TV.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Yeah, it's a pain for us.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
When you guys have stuff we want, which happens once in a while

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
with music and videos and things of that nature

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
because you guys get a lot more music stuff over there.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Oh, it's Region 2, but it's PAL.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Exactly.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I remember one big thing that I had friends doing

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
was that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was out on DVD over there

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
way sooner than it was over here.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Highlander.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:05.000
When the Highlander series came out, the UK versions had extra footage.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
So take comfort that once in a while you get something the nerds really want.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000
You get them unedited, and freaking Torchwood has blood and sex and language,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
and I love it.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
So, sorry.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I had to go off on that because I was watching Torchwood

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
and going, wow, this wouldn't make it here.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Anyway, we have one from Miso.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
It says, I'm Miso Sky.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Is the creation of video games similar to an art form?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I think it is, as it involves creativity.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
It could be closely related to theater arts because it is a collaborative art.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
You have your music people, your writers, your technical people.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
So I think it could be an art form.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Happy Yule, Miso.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I agree.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
It's kind of like, I think it's very similar to a movie.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
It's like an interactive movie, especially these days.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I mean, movies, storyboarded, games storyboarded.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
There are similarities between the way that they go,

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
the scripting and the concept and everything.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I think it's a visual art form.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I mean, sometimes when you say art form, people want to compare it to paintings.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
They want to compare it to Picasso.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
No, art's a lot of different things.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Well, it's like spoken word is art,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
but you don't put it in the same category as you do music

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
because it's like poetry readings.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Yeah, art is subjective.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
If you're going to call movies art, you have to call games art.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Honestly, because if you're going to call live theater art,

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
you've got to call movies art in a way.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
So to me, especially with a game like Final Fantasy XII,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
which feels like freaking Lord of the Rings epic when you play it,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000
you can't tell me that's not an art form like a movie.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Well, even the actual physical art that goes into it.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I mean, we had, what was the...

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000
The bonus disc that has all the actual arts, like drawing art.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Or the gallery showings that had an E3.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Oh, sure.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Oh, the I.M. 8-bit and all that stuff.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
That was that book I got you.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
But that was the gallery too.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
The pixel one too.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Well, you know where we're going with this.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Yeah, but yeah.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
We got another email from Ricky that says,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Hi, DS Sky and Loki, how are you guys?

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Well, thank you and well said.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
This is a show I've been listening for a year now,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
pop in the chatroom every now and then,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
and would like to say thank you for all the times

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
where your long-running shows keep me entertained

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
through my travels on planes and long car trips.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
You're welcome.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
You guys pulled through for me as I waited for a wee

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
and did not manage to get one.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Many people asked what I was listening to

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
since I was sitting still for a few hours,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
so I just had to tell them about your amazing show, of course.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Good PR, heh heh.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Thank you.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Good job.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
The O.L. Army salutes you.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I have also spread the word at school to let O.L.R.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
widely known amongst my fellow classmates.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I work on the school newspaper

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
and I write the entertainment column,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
so I decided to spread some love.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I'm going to keep this short.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I have to study for exams, so peace and love to all.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
That was very sweet.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
That's it?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
They just wrote to write in what the great PR they're doing?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Well, thank you.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I mean, we really appreciate that.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
That's, you know, because, you know,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
we do do this for free and all that stuff.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
That's really if you feel like you want to give us something,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
give us word of mouth because we don't have the luxury

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
of, you know, a corporate sibling magazine

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
that can run four-page ads, you know,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
every month for our little dumb show

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
or, you know, we don't have the corporate tie-ins,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
the companies that we rely on word of mouth

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
and things of that nature to get our name out there.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
So if you feel like you want to give us something,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
you don't have to give us your money.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Give us your word of mouth.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I'll tell you what, though.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Give us your loyalty and your soul.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I'll tell you what, Ricky.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
If you shoot me an e-mail,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I'd actually like to see the newspaper.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
So I will pay for the cost of the newspaper

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
and shipping via PayPal.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Sweet.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
If you want to send me a copy so that we can see the article.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
We want to see that, too.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
We'll put it on the fridge.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Actually, we'll scan it in and put it up on the site.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
If we can.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
It could be a copyright thing.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
If it's not copyrighted, we will.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
We'll put it on the fridge, at least.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
If it is, we'll seek permission.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
All right.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Okay.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
But I figured, yeah, I would really love to see that

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
and besides that, you know,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I want to encourage our young journalists

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
and good luck on your exams.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I have one from Anush.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
It says,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Hi, Jamie, Rob, and Matt.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Rob, I was wondering if you guys will be doing an OLR meetup

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
like you did in New York City anyway.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Have a great show, you guys.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Where?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
That's a good question.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I don't know.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Well, I guess there's going to be an opportunity

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
to talk about live appearances that we're doing.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Really, the next thing we have scheduled

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
is that we're going to do,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
at least I'm going to be up for sure.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I don't know about my two partners in crime here.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I will be at Sakura Con in April in Seattle

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
and there's going to be at least hopefully one panel

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
that goes with that.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
That's the only live thing I have scheduled for right now.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I may or may not be able to make it to Sakura Con.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
If I travel in the next year like I did to New York City,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
certainly I'll do some type of meetup.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
It's a little too early to tell the places

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
that we're looking at right now.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
My travel buddy, my best friend who I travel with all the time

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
and I are looking at,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I'm looking at possibly Toronto or Hawaii.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I know those are really strange choices

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
but we really want to go back to Canada

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
because we love Vancouver

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
and he's never been to Hawaii so I want to go to Hawaii.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I'm also planning, and this is still up in the air

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
as I have to find a good package deal and everything,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000
I'm planning for hopefully around Christmas, New Year 2007

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
of going to London.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I definitely want to do the UK at some point as well

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
and I know we have a lot of great listeners over there

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
who I'd love to meet up with for tea and crumpets at some point.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Well, for me it's going to be pub crawling.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Whatever. All right.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
But anyway, yeah, that's...

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Especially if you have anything in California,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Northern California, we can easily get to the Bay Area

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
and even Southern California to some extent

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
if you have something like a convention that you're planning or whatever,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
we're definitely open to ideas.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
We're not too diva.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Our list of demands is pretty low

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
so get in touch with one of us.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
And of course I will be going to Alabama again.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Because we love to pimp out our show wherever we can.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
But hopefully I'll be flying into New Orleans

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
so maybe I can do a meet up when I fly out there

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
and I'll let everybody know when I go.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
And I go to Disneyland all the time.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
So no one's found me yet.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Anyway, this next one is a very special email.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
It comes from Kyle Snyder.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Dude, sweet. Kyle Snyder, for those who don't know,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
we used to do pretty much exclusively a show about DDR.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
So Kyle Freestyler for DDR.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Music writer extraordinaire.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Does music, his own stuff as well.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
He's a bit of a celebrity amongst the...

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
He's like a DDR celeb.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
He's like up there with the Mel Bs and the Mr. Wendels

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
and the folks you well know in the freestyle world.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Anyway, we still have the...

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
You know what?

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
People to this day still mimic that butterfly freestyle.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
So you know what?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
That's the ultimate compliment.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Imitation is the finest form of flattery.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
William Hung of the DDR community.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I don't know.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I don't know if I like that comparison.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Sort of.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
He's Kyle. That's it.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
He's Kyle.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
There is no other he's Kyle.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
He disappeared for a little while, but now he's back.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Dear crew of OLR,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
As you are aware, I have been back from my mission for almost two months.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I'm only going to be creating one more song on my current music mixing program

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
before I get a new and better one, Acid.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
My new song should be up in about two weeks after the song

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
after I get a new music mixing program,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
and my new music should hopefully sound better.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I'm planning on creating a remix to I Can Never Be Japanese,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
most likely a happy hardcore remix.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
That'll be fun, actually.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Is there anything you would like for me to work on for future songs

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
such as Eurobeat, Gabo, Electro, or any other genre?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I might not have a lot of time to create music starting mid-January

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
since I'll be starting college at that time.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
One of your fans, Cal Snyder.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
P.S. I plan to major in biotechnology.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Wow.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
That's pretty hardcore. Good luck.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Do what makes you happy.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
We don't want to tell you what music to do

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
because you should make the music that speaks to you.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
But I will say this.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I can't say too much,

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
but I can say that a pretty well-known music franchise

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
is going to be doing a contest pretty soon where you can be in the game.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
At least I think.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I think that's still being negotiated.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
So I say save something really good for that

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
because I think you'd want to be in a video game, wouldn't you?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
That's pretty cool.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
And that goes for anybody out there who's making music.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
My advice in this, actually,

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000
because a lot of what goes in physical art goes into music art,

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
you know, go where your instincts lead you.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Don't stick to a style.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Experiment.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
You know, even if it comes out like complete crap,

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
if you've learned something from it, then you've progressed.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
That's what I have to say.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
So, moving on.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000
We have one, actually, from the SoberIrishGuy.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
That's cool.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
The one.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
The one.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Okay.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
As first off, generic thanks and praise-like things from Ireland,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
your show has landed onto the Irish scene.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Anyway, onto something important-ish.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I've been listening to the downloads and loving them for quite a while now,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
but I need to make a request.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Every time you give release dates for the UK,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
this is going to now be wired.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I see.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
This is the email that inspired that.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I always think, well, that's not me.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
And for the past 90 years, anyway.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Since you're always talking about European gamers

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
and how we keep getting screwed with release dates and Bahmani releases,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
they don't actually exist over here.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Thanks a lot, Konami.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Any chance of getting European release dates?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I actually am working on it.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I need to find some sources.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
What I'm thinking about doing is actually sending in some of my PR contacts

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
at some of the various companies

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
and seeing if they'll give me international release dates.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Keep in mind, guys, and trust us, we love our international listeners

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
and we love the fact that this little show that we do out of the spare bedroom

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
goes everywhere, everywhere in the world.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
That's the ultimate compliment.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
But keep in mind, we can't do everybody

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
because India just got the 360,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
so they've probably got their own release dates,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
and I'm sure we've got at least one listener there.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I'd love to do those release dates, too.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
We would do a show of nothing but release dates.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
But we'll try.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
We'll try to do at least the big titles for some places.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
My idea for this is to do quarterly updates

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
for major countries like, for example, for India,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
for South America, for Africa.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Africa.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Sorry, I couldn't pass that up.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I hear there's new screenshots of Africa out there on the interweb.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Well, also, though, for any place that's got similar dates but deviations,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
I'm going to actually try doing different compilations for my list

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
and seeing if I can't be a little more accommodating.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I'm doing my best, guys.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
We'll do what we can, but we do appreciate your suggestion

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
and listening to us in other countries.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000
He also addressed another part to me about Aragon.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Really?

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Because you know I was complaining about how poorly written the book is.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Basically, to go into the rest of this email,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
it says, I've read Aragon, and while it did start a little badly written,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
I enjoyed it, but then again, I've read a lot of fantasy,

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
both bad and good, Dragonlance and Discworld, respectively.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I actually like Dragonlance, but I also played a lot of D&D

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
when I was into Dragonlance.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Aragon is a bit slow-paced, and the overall story is good,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
even if the writing isn't terribly great.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
I have been getting some feedback on the book,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
just from my friends' local emails I've gotten.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I have started reading it again,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
even though I've been distracted by copious amounts of Doctor Who

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
and the fact that I'm into reading historical biography now

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
and anthropology books.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I'll set some time aside for it.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I'll give it another chance.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
This story could be better than the writing.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I've read worse fan fiction, so I'm going to give it a go.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
In closing, it says, anyhow, that's it from this side of the Atlantic.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Keep up the show and keep uploading it.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000
D&D 9 is not a good time to be awake.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I also sort of want to wake up in the middle of the morning

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
for myself and say, hey, overseas people, listen to me,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
because I am randomly awake on the weekends that early.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Moving forward, the last email comes...

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Oh, I just want to say real quickly,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
some of our tape shows, such as the new STFU show that's not live,

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
it's taped, we might actually play those at an hour

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
that would be friendly for the folks overseas.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
We are exploring doing that, because it's really easy for us

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
to do the rebroadcast of the tape shows,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
so something to look forward to.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Last one comes from Robert.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I really missed you guys this week.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I like your name, Robert.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Aww, thank you for missing us.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Anyway, I've just unlocked the first bonus mission on Elite Beat Agents,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
and although I'm nowhere near ready to say I'm all that good at the game yet,

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
I was wondering if there's a soundtrack mode

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
or audio test mode unlockable in the game

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
to listen to the music outside of the game.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.000
It's amazing the amount of digital audio they were able to fit into that cartridge.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I don't know of any.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I'm sure someone might figure out a little hack or crack for the cartridge.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I would say, honestly, the songs are so close to their originals that,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
well, not always.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Some are sped up, like a couple of songs are sped up,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
so I guess I could see why you'd want that.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
You never know.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Some folks are able to creatively rip from the game.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Some people do that.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Check some of those various sound archive sites,

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
especially for those really big in import games.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I'll bet you see something.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
You know what we had to do back in the 80s?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
We held up our boombox to our TVs and recorded it, and we liked it.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
That might be how you have to do it.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
I don't know.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
So that's it.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
That was it.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
No more emails?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
No more.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
How sad.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
That's all right.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Send us more.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
We love to hear from you.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Someone who doesn't like to hear from you so much is Capcom.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000
They totally ignore the folks who are bitching about dead rising text being too small,

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
and I guess in a way I'm teasing them a little bit, but what could they really do?

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I mean, do you think that is something that really could have been patched?

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
That's a pretty big game element.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I don't think that's something that could have been delivered in an itty bitty patch,

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
so I think they realized they botched it there,

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
or at least I thought they realized they botched it there.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Then the Lost Planet demo came out,

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
and I haven't played it yet, but I've seen pictures of it,

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
and yes, the text, once again, uber small,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
but this time they've changed it.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Folks were bitching on the Internet about the small text,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
and so Capcom sent out some screenshots and said,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
hey, listen you jerks who keep bashing us.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
We fixed it.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Here's a screenshot to prove it.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Remember that beta games and test games are not always indicative of the final release.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:50.000
STFU, bitches, in so many words, is what they said.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000
But their last game, which pretty much is their only game on the 360 right now,

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
had small text, and that was indicative of the demo,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
so what do you expect?

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I mean, they're just going based off of their prior track record.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Well, I'm sure Capcom's learned their lesson.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Well, good. I'm glad it took them only one game to do that.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
So, you know, that's always good.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I guess I'm spoiled because I am an HDTV owner,

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
and I didn't find the text in Dead Rising to be that bad.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
It wasn't that bad.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
It wasn't that bad at all.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Yeah, but again, you have Mondo, Hugh Joe TV in the living room,

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
and you have a TV that's bigger than mine, too,

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
so we're all spoiled, you know, for our friends on standard TVs.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Dead Rising on a standard TV, too.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Really? You didn't think it was a pain in the ass?

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
No.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Blurry?

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
The only thing I noticed was my monitor's too dark,

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
so I can't see anything when it turns night.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Then people just complain too much. I don't know what to tell you.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
But, whatever.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
So anyways, issues that need to be ironed out.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Well, apparently the new movie and TV download service for Microsoft's Xbox 360

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
has a little bit of some issues there.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
For example, the movie downloads.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Way too damn slow.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I haven't really tried it yet, because I don't really...

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Neither have I. There's not a damn thing on there I want.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Yeah, it's just, you know, maybe if I miss an episode of something, I don't know, but...

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I was going to get Star Trek Generations, but then it wasn't in HD,

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
so I was like, well, pfft, forget it.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
I only want to do this because it has HD movies.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.000
So, bring me more HD movies I'm interested in, and I'll maybe take a look.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I've also heard issues of people downloading stuff and getting something else.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
But apparently, they are going about to fix this stuff,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000
and I guess for the first initial downloads, if you did download something or whatever,

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
or tried to download something, and got your credits taken away,

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
and weren't able to download it, they will be refunding you your points and stuff.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
So, it's a work in progress.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000
But, once again, they really need to test this stuff before they go and release it.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
It's like a lot of the games, you know?

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Oh, it goes out, and oh, by the way, the...

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Can you really test thousands of people downloading your movie at once, though?

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Yeah, it's called an online beta test.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
They have stress tests. That's what they do.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:08.000
That's what a stress test is, to test to see if your servers can handle people downloading stuff.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I remember when I was testing Test Drive Unlimited,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
they would have you, okay, we need everybody to go to this one spot and start a race.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.000
We're going to see if this spot can handle the stress test of thousands of people doing that.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And that's what they do. They specifically try to break it.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And, obviously, they're just not testing it enough.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And same with the network play.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000
How the fuck are you playing Call of Duty 3 or something like that not know,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
especially after the last one, that the online play is going to be laggy as fuck,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000
and you release the game anyways to make it there for the holiday rush.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
You know right away that it's not going to work, but you're just planning on patching it later.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
It's kind of like, oh well, whatever, it's good enough for now, you know, we'll patch it later.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
People will buy it anyways, and they do.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Because how are they supposed to know?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
That's ridiculous.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Well, speaking of the other things that are going to be available, at least online and beta testing,

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
there is going to be a beta test for Halo 3, a public beta.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:18.000
The signup begins on the 4th, that's this Monday, so people will already be listening by that point, hopefully.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:26.000
But you would have to go to Halo3.com on Monday and start your signup.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.000
They're basically saying that Halo 3 beta will be available in the US, Europe, other places internationally,

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
and they are going to keep the updates through that site.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
So that's good, but if you don't manage to get in on that though,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
there are going to be premium multiplayer maps for Halo 2 coming out as well.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
This is going to be available in the spring.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And there's going to be more info on the beta in the next coming weeks according to our Microsoft reps.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.000
We bugged him when we first saw this, we were like, how can you get us in?

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Have you bugged him about that whole March release date? Is that what they're still sticking to?

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
No, he wasn't the one that told you that though, right?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
He wasn't the one that told me that. I haven't bugged him yet about that.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Well, just to say, I am going to try to sign up for the beta.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Can we? Doesn't this show disqualify us from that? Or are you just all going to lie?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Well, we don't get paid for it, so...

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I signed up for the Shadowrun beta, which is also this week, for the 360,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
so that might be another one if you want to try to get in on something.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
That's another thing that's going on too.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Well, it's sort of a part of it. We're going to get reports on it anyway, is how I see it.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
But my whole thing is, I love beta testing.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Well, I tried to sign up for a beta test, and the first question they asked was,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
do you work for a gaming website or whatever?

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I thought, yeah, because that's kind of what we do here, and it booted me.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
No, no, no. Work implies that you get paid.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
I guess that's true.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Therefore, I do not work in the hobby.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
The way the question was worded, I wanted to...

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I'm not going to lie, but just for a silly beta test,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
the way it was worded, and I don't want to say what site it was for,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
but it was a pretty major gaming operation,

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I was signing up, and it booted me right out for that.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I've gotten selected for quite a few beta tests lately.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I've actually gotten selected for betas through...

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Well, fuck you and fuck you, because I don't get paid for anything.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Through the media mailings, because I'll have the media send out.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
I did the Phantasy Star Universe beta. I guess that's something.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Everybody did that, though.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
All right, whatever.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I didn't do that.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
I'll look. If I can sign up, I will.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
If not, I'm not going to lose sleep over it.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Whatever.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Whatever.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
One thing I am pretty interested in checking out on Xbox

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.000
would be Double Dragon coming to Xbox Live with a full co-op mode,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000
and this report coming from the official Xbox magazine in the UK.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Only 12.5 megabytes for the game.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.000
I'm assuming this is based off of not the well-known Nintendo version,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000
but the arcade release that I believe Tecmos put out.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I'm guessing, because most of the Xbox games have been their arcade counterpart,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
and I just don't see an NES game showing up on the Xbox.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
So, going to be the arcade version, I'm sure.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Online co-op, probably be pretty cool, as long as it's not laggy as hell,

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000
so I hope you did your stress test.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Yeah, I was going to say, as long as it's able to stay synced, unlike Contra.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
So.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
I still haven't played Contra online.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I don't, nope, none of my friends have it.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I'm like the only one of my friends unless it hasn't.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I have Contra.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Do you? Let's play!

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Let's get some achievements online!

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Points!

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
That's all.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Are you sure?

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Yep.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Are you sure you're sure?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Yes.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Okay, okay, okay.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Well, anyway, Microsoft, speaking of which,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.000
has decided that they are going to release the 1080p fix.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
It's a dashboard update.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Basically, you are going to, when you log into Xbox Live,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
the patch is supposed to fix everything.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000
You don't have to download the update, but you can't connect to Live until you do.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
I was going to say, I don't think, yeah, because I was trying,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I got the patch last night when I was playing one of those Burger King games,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
and it made me do it, so.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000
But I'm pretty much always on Live, so.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Well, it's also trying to also improve the accuracy of the reporting on things.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
You'll see changes to your recently played games.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Oh, interesting.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Alright, cool.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I couldn't tell you what it did for 1080p, though, because my TV doesn't support it, so.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Well, it's supposed to also have improved plug and play for your headsets and the wireless controllers.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Again, something I don't have.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
It's also supposed to fix some VGA cable stuff, too.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Now, you have that. You could try that, I guess.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Yeah, but I don't have a TV that does 1080p with VGA cables.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Oh, there you go.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Alright.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Anyways, so one thing I'm kind of a little sad about,

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.000
and so far I haven't really tried it, so I'm not really sure if this has affected anything yet,

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:53.000
but apparently Microsoft is taking precautions and blocking some of the Europe Live users

01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:01.000
that are using the region workaround to be able to download demos that are available to the US.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And apparently they are blocking the accounts, not necessarily banning them.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:12.000
And I've done this over here to download Japanese demos and stuff, and it's fun.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.000
But so far they've only confirmed that they've been blocking the UK ones.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000
They've been blocking them from downloading our demos and whatnot.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Apparently some licensing issues or something. I don't know.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
But whatever.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
We're next.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
We're not next. We're spoiled.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000
But I don't know. I haven't tried it yet, so we'll see.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I guess we'll see.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Now, this was causing some rumors to go around that they were banning people, right?

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
But then they came out and said, no, we're not banning anyone, just blocking.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Yeah, it's just blocking people, because really they're just silver accounts anyway,

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
so I mean, yeah, sure, go ahead, ban the silver account.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
You can't just create a new one.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Folks are starting rumors that, oh, your gold that's on the same system is going to get banned too,

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
and I'm like, that would cause problems.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
They're just going to say, no, we don't want money.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Right.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Well, regardless, the mere idea that we're going to be robbed from checking out the Japanese and other international demos

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
has our feathers ruffled a little bit,

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
because we love to import here at Orange Launch Radio from our friends in Japan

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
and occasionally other countries too when they get stuff we want,

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
and so I feel a little bit angsty about this news,

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:33.000
so I think it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Yes, that's right, kids.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
This is the part of the show where we get ranty and angsty,

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.000
and who better to start us off when it comes to rants and angst than Dark Sakura?

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Amazingly enough, I am not angsty about anything today.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I'm not ranty. I'm on new medication.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Hell froze over, ladies and gentlemen. It's happened.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Somebody's skiing in hell right now.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Jamie's not angsty, and I'm just fucking with you.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
No.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I'm glad to hear things are such really happy.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
We finally found a treatment that's helping me with my chronic disease.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Anyone who's a fetal chosen is a chronic disease girl.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.000
But it's finally gotten something that helps, so I'm not really all that upset about much.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I'm pretty happy, actually, except for the person who took my blood at Kaiser.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
You freaking always leave bruises on me.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Because, like, plot, plot, blood, out.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Fine, but what about the bruise on my arm?

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Oh, will you do that anyway?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Because she's taken my blood a couple times before.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Like, whatever, lady.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Just, whatever. I don't like walking around looking like a freaking heroin addict or something.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
So, that's it.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Lucky.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Um, F.U. to my lower back right now. It's apparently a way my bed's situated in our bedroom.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Um, I'm next to the window, and the window, because it's in an apartment, has horrible seals.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.000
So, like, everything that's on the backside of my body, like, my neck, my back, and everything are completely sore right now.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:04.000
It feels like I was in a fight or something, but it's just from the cold air because it's winter.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
It sucks.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:11.000
So, I feel like an old person, like, oh, my back!

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Uh, I'm relatively in good spirits as well, so I'll just have to say F.U. to being so busy.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Because, you know, it's the reason why I have to pre-tape tonight, and I got, you know,

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000
like, four different things I'm doing today and more I'm doing tomorrow.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
But it's hard for me to complain too much because I have Monday off work.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:36.000
So, you know, I guess F.U. to the crowds at the mall I'll be fighting because I guess I'm going to try and do some holiday shopping during that time.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
So, we'll see. We'll see.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Wow, I'm glad to hear everyone's in relatively good spirits.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Hey, this will put some of our listeners in even better spirits.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.000
We have a story about lesbians.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Yay!

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Alright, lesbians, hooray!

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000
There was this story ran on this site called gamesradar.com,

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:04.000
which I guess is actually some corporate website, but I'd never heard of it until this story, so whatever.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:12.000
They are going over the top seven lesbian kisses in video games ever.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Let's see, it started off with number seven was Kitana and Mileena with their fatalities, right?

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Because remember how Kitana would kiss Mileena and then she'd blow up and then, you know, all that stuff.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Or that Mileena would kiss Kitana and then like suck her in and that's it.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
She'd eat her face or something.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Jade Empire came in at number six with their little girl on girl action on the eve of battle.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.000
And they have a little hot picture to go with it there, so if you're into lesbians you might like that.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
I like this one here. This is probably my favorite of the whole series.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Outlaw Golf 2 for the Xbox and Playstation 2.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:53.000
This would be when Summer, who is a stripper in the original Outlaw Golf, she gets with her partner Autumn

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:58.000
and they do this whole girl on girl thing and it's pretty hot, I guess, if you're into lesbians.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Number four was from Fear Effect 2 Retro Helix, which was, you know, kind of an older game for Playstation 1 on 2001.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:14.000
And there's this chick Hannah and her applied lover Rain.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.000
They do a make out in an elevator to distract some guards.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.000
No nudity involved though.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000
The number three hottest lesbian kiss in video games ever from GamesRadar.com.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
They said that Persephone and Niobe in Enter the Matrix.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:34.000
I remember that one because I actually played Enter the Matrix on, I think it was GameCube.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:42.000
And I remember that scene. So that's some Monica Bellucci and Jada Pinkett action there in your live action clip.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:52.000
And then in Leisure Suit Larry Magna Cum Laude from the character Luba who likes to get naked and make out with chicks at number two.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
I remember playing that game.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And the number one lesbian kiss game, Sims 2 with the do it yourself make outs.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:10.000
And they show a little clip here from the Sims 2 of some, you know, girls in scantily clad bikinis all over each other on their leopard print bed.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Now wait a minute. There is another game though I know that they had. It was full nudity and everything.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I can't remember what it was called though because it was some other Sims like knock off game.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:27.000
And I remember they were doing a thing on somethingawful.com.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000
They were kind of reviewing the game and talking about how he would make his characters force them to be gay.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Against their will type thing.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Interesting. You know what I'm trying to think? Well, okay, where's the list of the top seven gay male kisses ever?

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
And I'm like, God, I can't hardly think of any games that have that.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Bully, Final Fantasy VII, I guess.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
What?

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Wasn't there a part with like the whole gay thing in there?

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
There was the Barret Date.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Oh, the Barret Date. That doesn't count.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I've got the Barret Date.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
There's no making out action in the Barret Date.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
What it is, some Japanese player decided to get the Barret Date.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:12.000
And so back when the Dex drive was really big and I downloaded a Dex file, translated it for the US one and played it on my game.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
And it was funny. It was really funny.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Interesting.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000
The Yuffie one was stupid. I've seen the Yuffie one as well.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
I hate Aerith so all I've done myself is...

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
I'm pretty sure when I played through the game that's who I went on the date with was Aerith.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
She sucks.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
I liked her.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
She's dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
But she'll always be talked about through flashbacks so screw you, hippie.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Anyways, so speaking of...

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Oh, by the way, I want to say if anyone from GamesRadar is listening, I hope you weren't hurt that I didn't know your website but most people don't know us so we're used to it.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:50.000
But you should do the top seven gay guy kisses next for us to report on next week.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:58.000
So anyways, speaking of games that are out there that kind of are interesting.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
There's a new Bubble Bubble game coming out for the DS.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Bubble Bubble Doubleshot has been announced.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:12.000
It's a co-op dinosaur game and of course hopefully we'll have a level 30 boss.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I know, I was like, must refrain from joke, must refrain from joke.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Oh, I can't! Is there going to be a boss in level 30, you stupids?

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:27.000
It's slated for quarter one of 2007 and honestly I can say I think we've had enough Bubble Bubble titles in the last, you know, year.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Yeah, I know. I love Bubble Bubble but damn. Damn.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Oh, that was another one that came out I forgot to mention that's coming out next week here.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Bubble Bubble Evolution for the PSP.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Whoopee!

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Yeah, so...

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Hooray.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Alright, something else that will be coming to you very soon is Dark Sakura's website of the week.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.000
She serves the internet all over to look for a website that she wants to share with you and she has one for you right now.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
It's her website of the week.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Dark Sakura, tell the kids what it is.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.000
This is a website that I'm sure everybody knows about and it's about damn time I mentioned it.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Today's website of the week is 4chan.org.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000
The number 4, C-H-A-N dot O-R-G.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.000
4chan, where the internet also goes to die when it's not at MySpace.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Home of Caturday.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Home of lots of lovely, lovely Yowie and Yuri and Bunch of Hentai and Mecha and all kinds of art.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Cosplay.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
You wanna know something funny?

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000
What?

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I've never been to this site. I hear about it all the time but I just have never thought to go to it.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Ugh.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Isn't that weird?

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000
4chan has lots of fun but I love Caturday.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
That sounds worthy of a visitation.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Also though on 4chan, the other cool thing is the Oikaki board where basically you draw.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Oh, weren't those really huge on the internet a couple years ago where you'd have the paint program basically and you could save your paint and post it?

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Yeah, that was huge a few years ago.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:10.000
My very first Oikaki that I ever did was of Leifmon.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I don't like that name. That sounds too close to Bu-E-Kake.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
No, that's Bu-Kake.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000
I know it's Bu-Kake but it's close.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Bu-Kake and Oikaki, I should say.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000
O-E-Kake, not Bu-Kake.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Although you will find lots of Bu-Kake on 4chan.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Hooray.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
And it has an IRC channel so yeah.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I like 4chan. I'm sorry, there's some really horrible, stupid stuff on 4chan but I love 4chan.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Alright, visit it then.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000
If you're like me and you've never bothered to, I guess you can go visit it.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Alright, now what's interesting is that there's some rumors going around about what's coming up with Final Fantasy 6 on the Game Boy Advance.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:59.000
It's kind of rumor status because it was reported that you're going to be able to have the new characters.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.000
You can do Leo and you can play as Emperor Geshtal too, which I thought was a very strange character addition.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Usually in these Game Boy releases the games they add new stuff.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000
But now they're saying, no, it was all faked.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Somebody did a really good Photoshop job or a ROM hack job to get Leo and all that stuff in Geshtal in your party.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
So it's not true.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000
So I guess we won't really know until the game comes out.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:28.000
However, it does appear that the summons, having new summons in the game, Gilgamesh, Sabertender,

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
they will actually be there.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:37.000
So at least you'll have that something extra, even if the fangirl fantasy of reviving Leo may in fact not be true.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000
How hard would it be to just let them revive Leo already?

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:48.000
But I have to admit, when I read the story it did sound a little bit too good to be true that it was going to be the Phoenix Esper that revived him.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I'm kind of like, well, that almost sounds a little too cliche.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
I don't know.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I still would want to check this out, though, because Final Fantasy VI, good game.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Very good game.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Interesting.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Well, Elibits, which is coming out here in a couple weeks, is actually going to be having some Wii Connect 24 functionality, including level trading.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:16.000
The custom levels are going to be used, basically built with a point system.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:25.000
The points are charged for each item used to populate the level, including trash cans, Elibits, toy tanks, etc.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000
It says no level can exceed 1,000 points.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Basically, the levels can be sent to your friends with screenshots.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.000
And it's kind of a neat little thing.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Probably the first game I've seen actually utilize the Wii Connect 24 system, so looking forward to that.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Picking it up anyways.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Yeah, Elibits is one of those games that at E3 you were kind of like, eh, whatever.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.000
And then we heard more and more about it, and you and I were lucky enough to see it at the Konami thingy and all that.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
And the game's progressed along nicely.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Now I'm definitely interested in picking it up.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
I think there's other people that feel the same way, too.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
And this Wii Connect 24 sounds very cool.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000
And I think a lot of people will be picking it up probably just so they can participate in that.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
It'll be interesting to see what happens.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Well, that was the last story that we had for you guys tonight.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Unfortunately, we have no Skype line tonight because we're not actually live.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:26.000
But we will be back live next week at Orange Lounge Radio and, of course, inviting your calls as always and your participation.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I'm sure a lot of you have some built-up stuff, having no show last week and now a taped show this week.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000
But is there any last-minute stuff from Loki or Dark Saga?

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Yeah, I've got a couple things.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
I do as well.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Well, let's start off with Dark Saga. Why don't you start us off?

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Just for UK news, for Football Manager 2007, Sega and Sports Interactive released a patch for the PC, Mac, and Intel Mac versions of Football Manager 2007.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Basically, the patch deals with some of the issues that the fans brought up, like some of the bugs that were still in the game.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:08.000
The patch is saved game compatible, but to get the full effect, you have to start a new game.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:15.000
You can actually grab it from Sports Interactive's website over there.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I know it's kind of a big game over there, so I thought I'd bring it up.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
All right.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:26.000
If you're looking to use your old Nintendo and Super Nintendo controllers with the Wii Virtual Console games,

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:33.000
there's a website called RetroZone, which is at RetroUSB.com.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000
This stuff is actually going to be slash Wii dot HTML.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000
You can buy both the adapters for the NES and Super NES controllers.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Those are priced at $19 each, including if you buy a second controller, it will have free shipping.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
That's kind of neat.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.000
You would actually plug into your GameCube ports on the Wii, so that's pretty cool.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:05.000
And then finally, apparently there's that hacking group Team Executor that was famous for a lot of the PSP stuff.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:12.000
They've got the full-size SATA hard drive working with the PlayStation 3,

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.000
and now they have 750 gigabytes on their one PlayStation 3.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
For what? For what?

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000
For what you may say, well, they're working on running the Blu-ray game.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000
For porn. For 750 gigs of porn on your PS3.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000
For running the Blu-ray games off the hard drive.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.000
All right. I see. Interesting.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000
So that's it.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000
All right. Well, that's going to do it then for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Hey, we want to thank you guys for still tuning into us and supporting us,

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
even though we weren't here last week.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000
We're a little bit shorter this week with only one part,

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:50.000
but you know we love you guys out there on the Internet for listening to us and supporting independent Internet radio,

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
and we will be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Two parts live and the usual stuff.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000
We've missed it, so we'll be seeing you guys next week.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Until then, on behalf of Jamie Summers and Loki, have a great night.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
We didn't do final thoughts.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Oh, crap. We didn't do final thoughts.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.000
My bad.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000
My bad.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Okay, quick. Final thoughts.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
DarkSaga, Jamie Summers.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Money.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Loki.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I think I'm going to call my new show Screwdriver.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
I want pumpkin pie.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Good night.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Good night.
