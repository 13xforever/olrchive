4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,840
girls do when they go to LA. I know she's been making a lot of LJ posts, which by the

5
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,040
way reminds me to pimp the LiveJournal community. It's a good time. We have a lot of people

6
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,560
there and we like to post show updates and sometimes there will be random discussion

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,220
threads as well. Check it out if you're a LiveJournal user. Orange Lounge is our name

8
00:00:53,220 --> 00:01:00,220
on LiveJournal. Also, we have a MySpace. MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Give me more friends.

9
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,980
We want more friends. And by the way, clips of old shows are also on there and sometimes

10
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:10,100
we post announcements as bulletins and fun things like that. We won't spam you too much

11
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,660
on MySpace, we promise. We used to post little pictures when people would add us, like of

12
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,420
little game-related things. We'll probably get back into doing that pretty soon, so maybe

13
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:25,320
give people incentive to add us because we'll comment on you. The only people that have

14
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,600
a login for that are myself, Loki, and DarkSakura, so you know if you get that, it's one of us

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,300
doing it. So, add us on MySpace. It's fun. Yes. Do that or we'll kill the ferret. Anyway,

16
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:42,300
let's get back into some news. Anyways, so this one website, reghardware.co.uk, is saying

17
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,260
that Sony is going to ship a major PS3 firmware update in March. And what will it contain?

18
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:58,260
We don't know. But last, SC Europe VP of Technology, Paul Holman, cited by an Australian website,

19
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,860
Smart House, said, new features and new gaming capabilities. Well, that could be anything.

20
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:13,060
God damn people. You know, actually, you know, it's only bad enough that we report on this

21
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,820
because it's someone reporting on someone else reporting on something else saying, there

22
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:24,820
will be new things coming. Where is equally the blame? I guess there's not too much to

23
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,140
be surprised here. What I think is interesting about this story is that if they do release

24
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,540
a big firmware update in March, then it looks like they might be kind of mirroring a little

25
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,700
bit what the 360 is doing with their biannual updates, right? Because they have to do the

26
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,980
fall update and the spring update, at least that's what they promise. And I believe they

27
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,900
were doing that on the old school Xbox as well, so this would, you know, kind of line

28
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:51,460
up with that. It makes sense. One of the rumors, because one of the stories ran, was that it

29
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:58,460
would be the 1080i fix. And, well, we know that's not the case because they already released

30
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:06,420
that. Alright, well, you know, if this whole PlayStation 3 thing is just not for you, this

31
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,540
blogger over at 3dgamer.blogspot.com posted this big list of things you could do instead

32
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,320
of buying a PlayStation 3. You could fly to London. You could pay your rent for a month.

33
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:26,320
You could buy 300 Big Macs or 3,000 bandages. You could buy 60 large cheese pizzas, 250

34
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,340
gallons of gas. You could buy a 1988 Mazda 323. I guess that's the Blue Book value of

35
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,540
it. You could buy 15 shares of Sony Corps, though that might not be the best idea right

36
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,440
now. You could take a skydiving course and do four jumps. You could get a personal trainer

37
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:49,440
and do 17 sessions at the gym. You could buy 225 pounds of canned tuna. Or, and it ends

38
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:55,060
here on a nice on note, you could provide food, shelter, and clothing for two children

39
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,300
for an entire year and have $150 left over for something nice for yourself. What this

40
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,460
doesn't address are the eBay profiteers, though. They don't factor that in. So, I think they

41
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,180
should have said, you know, all these eBay profiteers are stealing from the poor, defenseless

42
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,140
children who have no roof over their head, you bastards.

43
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,140
Think of the children.

44
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,180
I know. Why isn't anyone thinking of the children?

45
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,140
But can you play Resistance on 225 pounds of tuna? I think not. At least that's what

46
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,140
Sony would tell you.

47
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,140
Anywho...

48
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,140
You can't play Ridge Racer with 30 years' worth of toothpaste.

49
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:39,140
Oh, anyways. Well, definitely time for some wonderful street dates, as always. And I like

50
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:45,480
to start things off, like we normally do, with some exclusive street dates that you

51
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,440
probably haven't heard from any place else.

52
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,920
So let's get going here. Now, there's a few stories that came out this week with games

53
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:59,120
that are coming out. One of those, of course, is D3's Simple 2000 series game for the 360

54
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,560
called Earth Defense Force X. And that's coming out on the 360 in the United States on March

55
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,840
21st. And it's only going to be retailing for $39.99. So not bad. I'm glad they're actually

56
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,120
bringing out some cool games like that.

57
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,120
One game that we saw a little bit about, I think last month, was Def Jam Icon. It will

58
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,960
be coming out on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 on March 7th. March is, of course, a big

59
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,400
month for gaming beyond November here.

60
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,440
Of course, around the same time, we're also going to be getting Godfather on the PlayStation

61
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,440
3. Yay, a game that's over a year old now. And Godfather the game on the Wii. Now, that

62
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,720
hasn't been said anywhere yet. That'll be interesting.

63
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Godfather on the Wii?

64
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,440
Godfather on the Wii.

65
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,040
The fuck?

66
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,920
That'll be fun. I can't wait to play it.

67
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,080
I mean, you're going to get to bitch-slap someone with a controller and it'll, like,

68
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,040
actually work?

69
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,440
I think so.

70
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,600
That might be kind of fun, actually. They really do need Grand Theft Auto on the Wii,

71
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,080
don't they?

72
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,880
Oh, I can't wait.

73
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,200
I want to, you know, be able to pull the hooker out of the car, like, in the real motion,

74
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
and then, you know, bitch-slap her.

75
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,960
Anyways, Rainbow Six-

76
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,480
Rated M.

77
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,760
Rainbow Six Vegas for the PlayStation 3. One of those wonderful launch titles delayed to

78
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,760
March 14th. Co-PlayStation 3. A little bit, you know, more difficult to develop for, apparently,

79
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,240
than we thought. Sonic the Hedgehog also delayed on the PlayStation 3 until January 17th.

80
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,160
Oh, are they going to make the game fun?

81
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,200
Probably not.

82
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:43,160
SSX Blur, which is going to be coming out on the Wii, also coming out in March on March

83
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,480
14th, and that would look pretty cool. I can't wait. They've cheapified it a little bit,

84
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,400
and it looks pretty fun.

85
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,720
I like the cute little video I think you played on our pre-tape show last week. It looked

86
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,440
pretty cute.

87
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,480
Yeah.

88
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,440
Some other stuff. Forza 2 has been delayed until May 16th of next year. Yay.

89
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,920
There's some new DS games coming out, including Theme Park, which I think was announced this

90
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,760
week. That's coming out March 21st, 2007. And another game called Pogo Island, which

91
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,920
is coming out on March 27th.

92
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Finally, Stranglehold, another launch game that was supposedly coming out on the PlayStation

93
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,760
3, delayed to June 1st of next year.

94
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,080
Sid Meier's Pirates on the PlayStation Portable is going to be coming out February 26th. This

95
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,480
one, as I teased on the Wednesday show, Charlie Brown All Stars for PlayStation 2 coming out

96
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,640
March 28th.

97
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Rad.

98
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:41,080
And then finally, Silent Hill Origins, such an interesting game on the PS3, delayed all

99
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,480
the way to April 25th.

100
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,600
Hmm. Interesting. But of course, dates are subject to change, as they always are. And

101
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,000
one thing I wanted to ask you about, actually, this wasn't anywhere on the show world, but

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,040
something we put on OrangeOnTrader.com earlier this week is that folks have been spotted

103
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:01,240
on the internet playing DDR Universe on Xbox Live, which would indicate that the game has

104
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,160
gone gold, I would believe, or else the achievements and things would not be loaded on Xbox's servers

105
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,640
so that we could find them. So, March still?

106
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
So, March.

107
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,320
Are you sure? Because if the game's gone gold, don't you think this will make the January

108
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
date?

109
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
No.

110
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
All right.

111
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Still positive it's in March.

112
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,840
Why? What makes you so damn sure?

113
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,320
Their January game is, or actually, they don't have a game in January.

114
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Well, there you go.

115
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
February.

116
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
No.

117
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,640
Okay, they have games coming out in January. They have Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, I want to say, Tag

118
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,680
Force is coming out, and then, I don't think anything else.

119
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,160
Yeah, well, what if you go to work tomorrow and then, oop, the date got shifted. They

120
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,160
bumped it up.

121
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,360
They normally don't bump stuff up. I'm thinking they're waiting until March. March is the

122
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:50,040
big dates, you know, for games. It's the second push of the, or I guess, the first push of

123
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:58,520
the year, other than November. So, it's still going to stick to March. You'll see. You'll

124
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
see.

125
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
We will.

126
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
We will.

127
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
We will.

128
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
We will.

129
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
We will.

130
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
So, we shall see.

131
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,880
And just because they're playing it online, hey, remember, Pimps at Sea is online right

132
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
now. Does that mean he'll...

133
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,960
But you couldn't go in and see, like, the little graphics and all the achievements and

134
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,880
everything. Those weren't loaded on Xbox's servers. You couldn't do anything with that.

135
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,920
It just showed that they were playing Pimps at Sea. But with DDR Universe, that's how

136
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,200
we were able to get all the achievements.

137
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
So, it doesn't mean anything.

138
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,600
Oh, we'll see.

139
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
We will see.

140
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
We will see.

141
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
MF'er.

142
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,400
Let's go to our buddies over in the UK. Since Dark Sakura is not here this week, I'm filling

143
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,040
in with some dates that you will be getting some new games. Of course, things are starting

144
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,560
to slow down a little bit since it is getting towards the end of the year. But you do have

145
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,840
a few games coming out the week of the 15th, including Cats and Dogs 2006. Those are two

146
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,120
separate games, Cats and Dogs 2006.

147
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,520
Hamsters is also coming out on the DS, so that should be fun. Star Wars Lethal Alliance

148
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,320
on the DS, now that sounds pretty good.

149
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,420
Superman Returns, the video game on PlayStation 2. Oh. Oh. I played the demo of Superman Returns

150
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,080
for Xbox 360. Sucked.

151
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,240
You know, it was more fun to pick up a stranger and try to drop them in the ocean or leave

152
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,880
them on the beach and then fly away. Like, I had more fun with the whole sandbox element

153
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,600
than playing the actual game. It's pretty bad. I'm not going to pick up the full game

154
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,320
based off that demo. I know you're not supposed to make a final judgment of a game based off

155
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,320
a demo, but seriously, don't put it on Marketplace if you don't want people to do that.

156
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,440
I can't pull my pre-order from based off the demo.

157
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,200
Yeah, I can't say I blame you. Oh, also, The Sims 2 Pets coming out on the PSP, also from

158
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,480
EA. Far Cry Vengeance and Marvel Ultimate Alliance on the Wii on the 22nd. Also, Star

159
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,480
Trek Tactical Assault on the DS, also on the 22nd.

160
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,040
And also for the U.S. Sorry, did I cut you off? My bad. No, not yet. It's okay.

161
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,800
Anyways, so, the U.S. We've got some pretty good releases this week. Twilight Princess

162
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,880
on the GameCube, you know, for those who may not have a Wii yet. Definitely worth picking

163
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
up. Holdouts.

164
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,600
All your holdouts. Star Trek Legacy, which actually I think that

165
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,840
came out last week. Some of this list is wrong. Anyways, moving on.

166
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,040
I don't remember seeing Star Trek Legacy when I went to the store today.

167
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,600
I thought that was last week. It's moved around so many times it's hard for me to remember.

168
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,040
Blazing Angels on PlayStation 3. Yay.

169
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,520
And Fullmetal Alchemist Dual Sympathy on the DS.

170
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,960
What you hear is supposed to be better than the PlayStation 2 ones.

171
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,800
Let's see here. Elibits on the Wii. I can't wait to pick that one up. That one looks pretty

172
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,560
awesome. I want to get that too, yeah.

173
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,040
Let's see here. Then, I do believe on the PC we've got Rayman's Raving Rabbids finally

174
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,680
making its way out there. And, let's see here. Oh, there's actually a few other things on

175
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,040
the Wii. Metal Slug Anthology.

176
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,120
Chicken Little Ace in Action. Rainbow Six Vegas is finally making its way

177
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:03,780
on the PC. And then, on the PSP we've got Blitz Overtime.

178
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,920
Which is a part of Blitz League. And then, actually I don't think there's any

179
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,560
love for PlayStation 2. Not too much at least. College Hoops 2K7 which was delayed from the

180
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:23,080
original Xbox 360 launch. And then, yeah, that's about it.

181
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,960
December is really horrible for games. Yeah, I mean we got most of your big shit

182
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,320
already last month. Pretty much, yeah.

183
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,240
Japan, also kind of slow over there. But they are getting some releases including on December

184
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,440
14th on the Xbox 360 they're getting Phantasy Star Universe finally.

185
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,160
We actually got it first on the 360 here in America.

186
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,560
So, rumor is the Japanese and English servers are supposedly together.

187
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,240
So, you might start seeing some Japanese players start populating the game if you're an Xbox

188
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,120
360 player. Also, a game called Earth Defense Forces 3

189
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,400
coming out on the 14th of December. They're getting Lost Planet on December 21st

190
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,480
might I point out as well. Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Full Auto

191
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,000
2, Battle Lines. Oh, that's actually, is that the US release

192
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,800
actually? Could be? I believe that it came, the US one came out

193
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,840
last week. Oh, so they're getting I guess that over

194
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,720
in the Asian territories as well. Motorstorm, also the Japanese version of Motorstorm

195
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,140
coming out December 14th. We have to wait until March.

196
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,580
Coming out, well, trust me it isn't much. Coming out on the Wii, Pokemon Battle Revolution

197
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,120
and Rayman Raving Rabbids. Also, a title based off of Bleach is coming

198
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,960
out there as well on the Nintendo Wii. Coming out on the PlayStation 2, Beat Mania

199
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,080
2DX Happy Sky. A lot of you music game fans have been waiting

200
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,760
for that one. That is finally coming out this week, December

201
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,620
14th. So, be on the lookout for that.

202
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,320
Lots and lots of PS2 titles by the way coming out this week in Japan.

203
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:56,480
Nobunaga no Yabu. Actually, I think that's just going into best hits this week.

204
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,960
Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2 also going into the best hits.

205
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,520
And looks like a lot of games getting price reductions on the PS2 this week in Japan.

206
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,560
So check that out. Well, as I mentioned earlier.

207
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,100
Wait, one more, sorry, one more. I want to say on the DS, three Rockman games

208
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,520
coming out. Ryuusi no Rockman Dragon, Leo and Pegasus

209
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,960
all coming out December 14th. Now, what's the funniest game title for this

210
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,560
week? For the DS?

211
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,800
Just for anything. I don't know, there's not a lot of funny stuff

212
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,000
this week. Oh, here we go.

213
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,480
Stationary style set DS Lite, although that's not a game, it's just a set.

214
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,880
It's like a little, you know, like accessory. I don't know, that's the best I could do,

215
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,600
sorry. Okay, anyway.

216
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,000
No Love Hamster this week, sorry. Love Hamster.

217
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,720
Let's see, anyways, as I mentioned earlier, the PlayStation 3 just had a firmware update

218
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:57,840
and was fixing some of the issues that they had with 720p being downscaled to 480p for

219
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,120
those people that had older TVs that couldn't do the 720p and only did 1080i.

220
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,280
Well, apparently there's a firmware update now, the version 1.3, which actually made

221
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:16,640
attempts to patching that. It makes the 1080i the default resolution

222
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:23,160
now, and then the 720p as kind of secondary, so for the people that had, you know, the

223
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,480
1080i only HDTVs, you know, kind of fixed some of that.

224
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,240
However, though, there's still, if you want to watch a Blu-ray movie, the machine will

225
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,880
still scale it back, I guess, to 480p, so you have to switch it manually.

226
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,000
It sounds like that they've sort of fixed the problem, but not quite fixed it all the

227
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,040
way yet, so a little confusing, I guess, you know, mainly having switched up.

228
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,360
Why can't it be just simple, like the 360 where, you know, if it's in 1080i, it stays

229
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,800
in 1080i unless they pop in a DVD, which is only going to go to 480p anyways.

230
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,280
I mean, I don't know, why can't you just manually select your resolution?

231
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,720
That seems like it should make sense. Stop trying to think for me.

232
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,280
Well, I know Sony's been taking a lot of heat lately, but slowly but surely, we're starting

233
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,880
to hear some pretty rad things coming out of Sony, and I think this is pretty awesome.

234
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,000
Even though there is no, you know, price or date set for this, the PlayStation Network

235
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,840
is going to be getting Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.

236
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
I think that's pretty rad.

237
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
That's pretty awesome.

238
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Yeah.

239
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,020
That's according to Famitsu Weekly, and Bandai Namco is going to be releasing this for the

240
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,440
download service.

241
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,280
Probably Japan will get this first, but at least gives us an idea of what's to come.

242
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,840
The PlayStation 3 version will feature full 1080p visual, and you'll also be able to play

243
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,800
Jinpachi, who previously was unplayable because he was a boss in the arcade version.

244
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,080
All the various modes that you saw in the arcade game, including Arcade Battle, Ghost

245
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,680
Battle, Gallery, will also be available in the PlayStation 3 version.

246
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,480
No word, though, if you could play it online.

247
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,360
I mean, I think that would be a pretty cool addition, but then again, if they were to

248
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,520
go that far with it, shit, they could probably release it as a full game and make pretty

249
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
good money.

250
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,920
So, it'll be interesting to see how much they charge for this on the PlayStation Network.

251
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,680
Certainly could be one of the, you know, I think PlayStation's kind of been looking for

252
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:17,000
its geometry wars, and sure, you've got Blast Factor and Blow, or Blow, Flow, Flow seems

253
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,240
to look pretty cool if you've played the little web application online.

254
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,720
I'm not going to live that one down.

255
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,860
But this could be like the, you know, must have.

256
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,520
This in like Gran Turismo HD also coming out in the network, you know, they're going to

257
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,680
have some pretty powerful stuff on their network soon, so Sony, and you know, I guess they

258
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,000
got Lemmings this week, too.

259
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
Yeah, Lemmings 2, and it was a remake.

260
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,680
It was completely redone.

261
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,680
Lemmings 2 was fun.

262
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
I liked it.

263
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,280
So, slowly but surely is Sony making some waves in the online scene, I must say.

264
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,000
For once, I say, good job, Sony.

265
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,080
Yep, and actually Enchanted Arms for the PlayStation 3 is going to be getting some enhancements

266
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,440
as well.

267
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,520
It's kind of cool just to see that it's not just a port.

268
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,920
What they're going to be adding, though, are going to be some graphical tweaks, of course,

269
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:08,360
including new character animations, new chapters to the story, new golems will appear, and

270
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,000
the battle system will be improved.

271
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,200
Will the voice acting be improved?

272
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,400
I don't know about that.

273
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Well, that's too bad.

274
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,880
Even the themes for the opening and ending will be recomposed by Mink.

275
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,240
That's kind of weird.

276
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,980
I wonder why.

277
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,840
It seemed fine in the 360 version.

278
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,840
Okay, whatever.

279
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,320
Whatever they want to do.

280
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,680
I would not pay $60 for this on PlayStation 3, though, when I already have it on Xbox.

281
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,520
It's a decent game.

282
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,920
I think for most people, unless you're like hardcore RPG, it's probably going to be a

283
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,520
little more of a rental for you, but I had a good time with it on 360.

284
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,760
I really do need to finish the damn game.

285
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,760
You know me.

286
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
I have gamer ADD.

287
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,120
I can never stick with one game too long.

288
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,820
Well, a lot of flack coming Sony's way, even though we just said something nice about them.

289
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,840
Of course, other folks out there like to, ourselves included, we're no less guilty,

290
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,280
have given Sony a lot of flack.

291
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,640
This is very interesting.

292
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,880
Again, your favorite, Loki, the analyst groups.

293
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,120
This analyst group called Symphonie has noticed that as far as market influence goes, HD DVD

294
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:20,960
has a 46% more positive discussions when it comes to websites than Blu-ray.

295
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,560
About half as many people are impressed with Blu-ray visuals than are with HD DVD visuals.

296
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,480
I guess these guys are scanning websites to see what people are saying.

297
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,760
Of course, they don't say what websites they're looking at, but whatever.

298
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,040
Now what's interesting about this is that they say the key reasons for the low Blu-ray

299
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:43,780
acceptance is the forced inclusion on the PlayStation 3 and Sony's previous format reputation.

300
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,660
This might be alluding to the fact that PlayStation 3 might actually be being harmed by the fact

301
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,600
that the Blu-ray is a forced thing on it.

302
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,400
Just like the UMDs, UMDs didn't really take off either.

303
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,400
We all know why UMDs didn't work, because they were charging more than they were for

304
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,120
the DVDs and there wasn't as much on them, and that you couldn't watch them on a TV.

305
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,320
It was a stupid format from the beginning, really.

306
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,800
If they had charged half as much as the DVDs, I bet the format would have done a whole lot

307
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
better.

308
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
A whole lot better.

309
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:20,440
I just want to say, by the way, what a report like this could do is it could make more of

310
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,600
those movie studios want to put out HD DVDs, which in the end is going to really hurt Sony.

311
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,360
It is going to hurt them, because pretty soon it's not going to be...

312
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,080
And that's the thing with Blu-ray and HD DVD.

313
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,160
I don't think anyone is really jumping into it right now either, because I buy a movie

314
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,400
that's in...

315
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,080
I buy an HD DVD player.

316
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,440
Well, now some of my movies are going to be on this format and some of them aren't.

317
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
So what?

318
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
I have to buy two different players?

319
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Fuck that shit.

320
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,280
I ain't going to buy that stuff.

321
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,840
Everyone's waiting until one format prevails and that's what they're going to buy.

322
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,760
Black Wolf, our good buddy Bobby Black Wolf is in chat right now, and he's bringing up

323
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,560
an interesting point.

324
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:09,120
He says HD DVD has a reference DVD that really shows off the power of the format, King Kong.

325
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,840
Blu-ray doesn't really have a comparable reference DVD.

326
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,720
He says Talladega Nights, which you might be thinking, not really a good choice, because

327
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,400
King Kong was more of an action type movie and big special effects.

328
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,360
Talladega Nights, maybe a few racing scenes here and there, but otherwise not exactly

329
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,560
a big explosions and manly man movie to show off the effects.

330
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,320
What they need to do is they need to fucking bring out the special edition of Final Fantasy

331
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,120
Advent Children.

332
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,800
That shit would blow people away.

333
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,160
Might not be a bad title for Blu-ray.

334
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,320
That's the only thing I want Blu-ray for is that movie, but GS68 says they should use

335
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
snakes on a plane.

336
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,360
I don't think the snakes on a plane should be used for a reference for anything other

337
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,680
than crappy movie.

338
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,840
Anyways, so the PlayStation 3, Sony is of course talking about improvements that they're

339
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,600
possibly going to make to the system as well.

340
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,520
They're talking about introducing new third party applications and hardware, new controller

341
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,720
schemes like the Eye of Judgment that's going to suck and-

342
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,760
Shit, we haven't heard about that in a long time, have we?

343
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,840
Maybe they went back and made it better.

344
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,120
That was supposed to be a launch title.

345
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,400
What ever fucking happened to that?

346
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,280
Oh, I know, because it sucks as a game console peripheral, because you have to have this

347
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,560
giant elaborate set up to play a card game.

348
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
No, I don't think so.

349
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,880
That's not what I'm going to spend my $600 on.

350
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,720
But it's the Eye of Judgment.

351
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,560
At least that's how they were always introducing it.

352
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,320
The Eye of Judgment.

353
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,760
Yeah, they could have gotten away with the brown Eye of Judgment and take a dump on your

354
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
console.

355
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,400
Anyways, so it's kind of interesting though about the whole article and this one text

356
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:57,960
site Smart House saying that Sony will launch a PlayStation 4 but not any sooner than 2010.

357
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,360
Wait a second, I thought the PlayStation 3 is future proof and it's going to have a ten

358
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
year cycle.

359
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Oopsies.

360
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:13,760
Anyways, so, duh, they're going to be adding more content and more stuff like iTunes and

361
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,960
blah, blah, blah.

362
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,600
It's going to basically be the same thing as all the other consoles out there.

363
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,600
They're going to offer download services for video and for music and for games.

364
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,920
It's not a big surprise.

365
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,160
Unless they said, you know, the PlayStation 4 is going to print money.

366
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:43,160
I'm surprised that Circuit City ad did not say that the DS prints money or something

367
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
like that.

368
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,920
I keep thinking of that picture I've seen all throughout the internet where it says

369
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
it prints money.

370
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,960
It has the happy Iwata and Miyamoto.

371
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,400
Anyway, I'm thinking about PlayStation 4 and I kind of think about it in my mind.

372
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,280
I know it's way too early to think about it.

373
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,400
What could really be better?

374
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,600
I mean, graphically these games are starting to look so realistic.

375
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,920
It's hard to imagine what could be even better, but I guess you never know.

376
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,080
I mean, I guess I won't know it until I see it.

377
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,280
And you know, a lot of us probably thought the same thing when the NES first came out.

378
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,960
Like, oh man, this is so much better than Atari 2600.

379
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,520
Games will never look better than this.

380
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,760
Listen, okay, the PlayStation 4 is going to be able to put out games at fucking 240 frames

381
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:29,400
per second and it's going to be in full 2160p.

382
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,480
Yes, but will it have the Eye of Judgment?

383
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,800
Of course it will.

384
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,920
And you know what the Eye of Judgment is going to be used for now?

385
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,080
Plane checkers.

386
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,440
Because checkers have never been so extreme.

387
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:51,160
Seriously, do you, I mean, I don't know about you, but like, if you were to play Magic Cards,

388
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,200
do you actually imagine, like, throwing a fireball at somebody or are your monsters

389
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
actually attacking?

390
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,160
Or is it just more of a strategy game that you're playing as characters?

391
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,280
I mean, do you really need the visual representation of your monster attacking some other monster?

392
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,520
And is that really worth the, you know, $600 for the console and there's a giant elaborate

393
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,200
setup that looks like it would never work as a peripheral?

394
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:20,280
I mean, and can you really imagine yourself, I bought this system and I bought these special

395
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,600
cards which, by the way, can probably be photocopied and used in the game, you know, instead of

396
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,760
buying these special decks because there's no copy protection against these cards.

397
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,560
I want to see them release this thing because it's the dumbest idea on the face here.

398
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,520
I remember when we went and saw this thing being demonstrated at E3, I walked out of

399
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,760
there and go, what the fuck was that?

400
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,160
I mean, this is not going to work as a game.

401
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,420
Which is funny because Miyamoto was going in right after us and I think you probably

402
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,060
heard that.

403
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,480
It was the dumbest thing, they were like, I wanted to raise my hand and go, why would

404
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
you buy this?

405
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,600
I mean, really, this is stupid.

406
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,200
And with the tech demo right now, great, leave it as a tech demo, then you see it as a launch

407
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
game.

408
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,440
No, it's stupid.

409
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,560
Just stop wasting the time on this and produce some better games.

410
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,720
I like the brown eye of judgment, that's something they should do.

411
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,840
I'm seriously, I mean, the brown eye of judgment would be more of a beneficial peripheral than

412
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:28,680
the fucking, you know, at least it would be neat, you know, I mean, like, look, the PlayStation

413
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:34,160
3 just took a dump, I mean, that's a lot cooler than saying, look, I made a card game, I mean,

414
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
come on.

415
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:41,120
I mean, they have the little dollies that will fucking take a dump when you feed them,

416
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,840
I mean, if your console can do the same thing, that'd be kind of neat, I guess.

417
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:54,280
I don't know, I can't just imagine with the brown eye of judgment when you're doing so

418
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,920
horribly in a game, the console shits itself.

419
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,880
Wait, you know, they have rumble on your-

420
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:10,740
My Sony, my Sony, wherever I go, he goes.

421
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,800
It's like this, okay, you know how they have the rumble features, you know, when there's

422
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,400
something scary on the screen, it'll shake, well, now your console can actually shit itself

423
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,680
when something scary is on the screen.

424
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:27,840
I mean, this is how ridiculous this peripheral is, I mean, I really wish our listeners could

425
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,060
have been there at E3 when they're demonstrating this thing, because it was the most ridiculous

426
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,060
peripheral.

427
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,060
It was like-

428
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,000
Isn't somebody in the room like it was you or somebody asked, like, what the hell's the

429
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
point of this thing?

430
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,520
Like, I swear to God, someone asked the question, like, what are you going to do with this?

431
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
I mean-

432
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
Like, is this it?

433
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,680
Like, I swear you asked, like, is this it?

434
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,000
Could I just copy the guards?

435
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,160
I mean, seriously, what is it?

436
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,600
And they raced us out of there.

437
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,480
It was so horrible.

438
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,800
Sorry.

439
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:04,880
I like this, Jeremy Todd one says, the brown eye of judgment, this thing is the shit.

440
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:19,120
You know what else never gets old is stories about stupid children and stupid parents.

441
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,960
A South Carolina woman recently called the cops on her 12-year-old son and had him arrested,

442
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:32,120
charged with petty larceny for stealing a Christmas present from under the tree.

443
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,360
What does this have to do with games?

444
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,640
Well, it was a Game Boy Advance.

445
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,960
Now, supposedly, this actually follows a string of crimes committed by the kid, shoplifting,

446
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,960
stealing from mom's wallet, and, oh, punching a cop.

447
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:52,280
Well, I'm glad that they got him in before it was too late, you know?

448
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,720
Next thing you know, he's going to murder someone-

449
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,200
Stealing from Santa Claus.

450
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,160
No, no, no, that's a big no-no.

451
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,120
You know what they should do when they take him into court, they should say, so you're

452
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,440
into games, huh?

453
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,840
Well, instead of having a normal judge, we're going to bring in the brown eye of judgment

454
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,560
and then it will decide if it's going to shit on the kid or not.

455
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,560
That'd be great.

456
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
You know what?

457
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
No, it's kind of interesting.

458
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,720
I'm surprised they haven't sued Nintendo over the Game Boy Advance because the desire for

459
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,800
the console made him punch a cop because I'm sure that's what they're going to, you know-

460
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,940
You know, there's a story that didn't get on our show roll tonight that I want to say

461
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,720
Rob Way sent to our mailbox, and sorry about that, buddy, we just, um, I forgot to put

462
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,760
it on there, but I'll mention it now.

463
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,440
Something about, speaking of cops, that cops were using their badges to cut to the front

464
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,440
of the PlayStation 3 line.

465
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
Did you hear about that?

466
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
Yeah.

467
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
They were, like, using their authority-

468
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
I'm not surprised.

469
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
Respect my authority!

470
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
And then give me a PlayStation 3.

471
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,080
Yeah, they did that with the 360, too.

472
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,280
A security guard did the same thing with the 360.

473
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,280
It's kind of messed up.

474
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Yeah.

475
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
Gotta have it.

476
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Anyways.

477
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,400
That's why the kid punched the cop.

478
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Definitely.

479
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,360
BIPORG99 in our chat says, who buys Game Boy Advance anymore?

480
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,360
Get a DS instead.

481
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
True.

482
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,360
No one buys Game Boy Advance.

483
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,240
I haven't sold one in ages.

484
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
Anywho.

485
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,760
So, now there's a brand new campaign that's being launched by GameStop, among other people,

486
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,920
to kind of educate parents on the ESRB rating system.

487
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,160
Don't copy that floppy!

488
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,040
Oh, sorry, the ratings.

489
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,320
Rating systems, not copying games.

490
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
Anyways.

491
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:32,360
So, they've launched a brand new website called respecttheradings.com, and it's basically

492
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:39,520
talking about what the ratings mean, and how you can enforce them better with your kids.

493
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,480
Basically talking about the different genres of games and stuff.

494
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:50,040
Also having a bit of- they have some actual terminology on here, which is great, because

495
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:57,480
they actually define frag, defeating an opponent in a first or third person shooter game.

496
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:04,520
Like giblets, tiny pieces of what's left of the character when they meet an unfortunate

497
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,520
end.

498
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:12,280
Giblets sounds like something your brown eye of judgement leaves on the camera.

499
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,000
Just talking about different things.

500
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's interesting.

501
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:25,120
I guess a good tool for parents, to be honest, no matter how many websites like this, and

502
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,600
how many posters, and how many people across the counter tell you about the rating system.

503
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,680
You're still going to have a mom calling her cops on the kid because she can't keep a Christmas

504
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
present under wraps.

505
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,360
And you're still going to have fucking people suing game companies because their kid committed

506
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,080
a crime and they found little Billy had a mature rating game.

507
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,920
I had no idea what the M meant.

508
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,840
I thought it meant it was good.

509
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,600
M for mom with the tattoo.

510
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
This is interesting.

511
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Going back to the last story a little bit.

512
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,760
Rama in our chat room says, Jimmy Kimmel had him and his mom on the show last week and

513
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,680
gave the kid the entire OZ DVD collection as a reminder of what happens in jail.

514
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,480
Do not parade this child on your talk show.

515
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,880
He's supposed to be punished.

516
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,240
Dude, he punched a cop.

517
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,160
I don't care if the cop punched him first.

518
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,200
You don't do that.

519
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,240
It's not like he just stole the damn thing from under the tree.

520
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,760
I mean, they're having him and his mom on television going like, oh, ha ha ha, it's just

521
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,080
a big misunderstanding, wah wah wah wah, we're one big happy dysfunctional family.

522
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,120
He's probably like on there, man, if I knew it was going to be this famous, I would have

523
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,880
stabbed the bitch in the vagina.

524
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
Exactly.

525
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,680
I'm just encouraging him to do it again and worse, because what's going to happen when

526
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,080
this kid's 15 minutes of fame runs out this time?

527
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,600
In fact, I'm done talking about him.

528
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,440
I don't want to talk about this kid anymore.

529
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,360
I'm glad I didn't say his name.

530
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,200
So yeah, respect the ratings, bitch.

531
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,520
That's what GameStop says.

532
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,840
And Activision also is hoping folks respect the ratings.

533
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,240
They're actually surveying parents on the ESRB.

534
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,560
They found that an overwhelming 84% of parents were familiar with the ESRB rating system.

535
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:18,280
79% of them say they pay close attention to the ratings of games their children play.

536
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
Very interesting.

537
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:25,340
Now, you know, also 80.4% of all statistics are made up on the spot, I suppose, but they

538
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:31,400
do say that in this survey, 1,014 online interviews were conducted among a nationally representative

539
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,480
group of video game players aged 88 to 24 and their parents.

540
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,680
They did this over a week from a Harrison group, who I've heard of before.

541
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,040
They're a pretty respectable surveying group.

542
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
So interesting.

543
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
Well, great.

544
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,760
Well, there were some interesting guides.

545
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,240
I know one of them was posted on Engadget this week talking about what you need, because

546
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,540
definitely one of the big gifts this holiday season is HGTVs, especially with game systems

547
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:06,080
out there, a lot of them requiring high def for better graphics and stuff.

548
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,040
You're going to need an HGTV at some point.

549
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,480
It's time to go with the times.

550
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:16,600
So there's a wonderful little guide, and actually this was done by A&E Interactive, part of

551
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:24,820
Mercury News, and they've got a guide to what gamers need to know when buying an HGTV.

552
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:30,040
And they go through everything from the basics, including what the different things mean,

553
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:37,520
including 480p, what the progressive versus interlaced means.

554
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,940
Very interesting stuff, including comparisons between flat panel or rear projection, etc.

555
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,120
And personally, the other thing, I don't know if it was mentioned on here, but another thing

556
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,880
you might want to check also when looking into a TV is websites like IGN, for example,

557
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:58,980
were running lists of HGTVs and possible lag on these TVs.

558
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,660
So you want to check into lag, definitely.

559
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:08,960
Also price-wise, you want to make sure that your TV is going to be putting out the right

560
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,600
resolution for you, whether you want to sell at 720p or you want to spend the money and

561
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
get 1080p.

562
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:20,080
And really, unless you have a really large TV, you're not going to really notice the

563
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,560
difference between 1080p and probably 1080i.

564
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:29,160
You know what they're really considering though, is it cheap?

565
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,700
Because most of these guys are what, like college kids that are trying to pool together

566
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,820
the money they've got to buy a good TV, so they're just going to buy something cheap.

567
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:44,960
If I were our listeners, what I would do is, and this is how I bought my TV, shopping around

568
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,400
I actually found Newegg.com was pretty cheap, they had a lot of refurbished TVs.

569
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,720
And you can buy refurbished TV, maybe it's last year's model or earlier this year, whatever,

570
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,760
but it's still pretty good for the price.

571
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:07,600
And I got a 37-inch TV, does upwards to 1080i, actually has built-in VGA, DVI, et cetera,

572
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,920
for about $800.

573
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,440
And it wasn't that bad.

574
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,860
And they're only going to come down in price.

575
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,860
And probably if you shop right after Christmas, I think you're going to get a lot of deals

576
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,120
that way too.

577
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,120
Here's how I got mine.

578
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,920
About a year ago, I bought an HDTV at Costco for about $600.

579
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,800
And that was a 30-inch widescreen, now it was a CRT, so I had a big back and some things

580
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,460
were a little bit blurry on it.

581
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,800
But here's the thing, that thing broke after like a year, but since I bought it from Costco,

582
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,000
they'll take it back.

583
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,760
So I took it because I still had the receipt, I held onto that baby.

584
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,280
So I took it back to the Costco, they took it back, and for about $100 more, I got an

585
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,720
upgrade to a flat 32-inch widescreen TV that's pretty awesome.

586
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,360
Costco's an in-house brand, but you know what, it works great for what I need.

587
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:55,200
And the one I bought, it's I don't think really a name brand, but it's just fine.

588
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,320
Really when you're buying a lot of these TVs, they're Sony or Toshiba or whatever, you're

589
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:07,120
buying it based off a brand, and brand names sometimes run a lot more expensive than they

590
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
really need to.

591
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:17,080
So just read the reviews online, compare pricing, compare features, definitely read any feedback

592
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,840
people have left about certain TVs and stuff, what issues you may run into.

593
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,800
Like mine, going into it, I knew it had a crappy TV remote, and when I bought it, yeah,

594
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,800
it has a really crappy TV remote that sucks balls, but that's the only thing that's really

595
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,720
bad about it, and that can be fixed if I really want to with a universal remote.

596
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,240
And I'm just too lazy and I don't care, so it'll work just fine.

597
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,760
But that's about it.

598
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,440
So just really do your research and score a pretty good HDTV.

599
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,200
Or if you're really cheap, just fucking buy the VGA cables for whatever system you want

600
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,760
to play it on, and just play it on your TV or your computer monitor.

601
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:01,200
That's what I did with my 360 before I had an HDTV, and it works just good, so interesting.

602
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,640
All right, well we're going to get into the mailbag, but first we're going to go to our

603
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,120
voicemail of the week, and if you want to leave us a voicemail, you can always give

604
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,440
us a call after show hours to 1-877-GAME-OLR.

605
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,940
That's a toll-free number in the US and Canada.

606
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,360
Get this, here is our voicemail of the week that somebody left.

607
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,480
I love you guys!

608
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,480
That's it.

609
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,480
Well, we love you too, but next time leave your name.

610
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,840
Needless to say, we have not been getting many voicemails of the week, so we are encouraging

611
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:39,320
you guys to leave your thoughts on the program in audio format by giving us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

612
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,400
Thanks to the anonymous listener who was spreading the love there, though, we appreciate it.

613
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,840
It inflates our egos.

614
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,920
We like that.

615
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,880
Let's get into our mailbag, boys and girls, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

616
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:59,080
Of course, Dark Sakura is not here this week, which means I'm going to be reading the mail,

617
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,680
so deal.

618
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,200
Next email comes to us from ureelover tonight.

619
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,280
Dear OLR, you guys suck!

620
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
And sarcasm.

621
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,360
He was just teasing because we said we didn't get enough hate mail.

622
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,840
Anyway, I remember listening to one of the podcasts a few weeks ago, and I forgot to

623
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,960
email you guys about it.

624
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,040
It was during the Wii launch, and some people were playing Risk at the front of the waiting

625
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,240
line, just like the old gamers back in the day do.

626
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,960
And I was just wondering, what bored tabletop games would you like to see in the Xbox 360

627
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,160
Marketplace Wii Connect PlayStation 3 online service?

628
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,320
I personally would like to see a couple things, first being Risk.

629
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,160
I would love to be able to say to the other people, I have Australia, bitches!

630
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,720
Or eat that, com shtaka!

631
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,920
Another one would be Monopoly, just seeing people's faces when they land on Park Place

632
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,240
with a hotel, and if they'd have to pay up.

633
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,720
The last one would be Candyland.

634
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,400
Don't know why, but I bet it would be Microsoft's new Gears of War or Halo 3.

635
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Definitely.

636
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,560
Keep up the good work, and reject false icons.

637
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,100
Thank you, ureelover.

638
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,680
So what bored games would you like to see on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox Live?

639
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
What do you think?

640
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,360
I'd like to see a second Monopoly, that might be fun, especially with the Xbox Live Vision

641
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,360
camera.

642
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,800
Because then you can dress up like Mr. Moneybags.

643
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,720
And I'm trying to think, actually...

644
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,240
Well you know you're getting Settlers of Catan in some of the British games, which

645
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
is kind of cool.

646
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,600
They're also doing Checkers and Chess, I think, at some point too.

647
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,360
I remember that was with the Vision camera.

648
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,440
Battleship might be pretty fun.

649
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,120
You know, actually, it'd be kind of cool to see some other, like...

650
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,320
I have one, I have one, Clue.

651
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Clue would be fun.

652
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Clue would be awesome.

653
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,840
And I don't want regular Clue, I want Clue Master Detective.

654
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,000
Or how about if you could, like, patch your, like, they could, see, you know what Xbox

655
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
could do?

656
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,400
Is that they could charge you then, like, you know, 80 points to download, you know,

657
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,040
The Simpsons Clue, and, you know, what other Clue games they've done.

658
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,180
All the licensed versions of Clue that they have, and, you know, Cameo Clue, and Project

659
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,520
Gotham Racing Clue.

660
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,080
I think it was the Ford.

661
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,360
It was the Ford in the Indy Raceway with the carbon monoxide.

662
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,520
Okay, maybe that's kind of lame, I don't know.

663
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,320
Next email comes to us from DDR Dollar Bill.

664
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,000
Hi, my name is Bill, though some of the DDR players from New York City and New Jersey

665
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,840
know me as Dollar Bill.

666
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,300
I used to freestyle on DDR a lot since 2001 and still do, though not as much anymore.

667
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,880
I did compete this year at Digital Life, though it was all improv and not meant to be taken

668
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,880
seriously.

669
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,680
I was the best, but I certainly was not the worst either.

670
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,640
The times I've had were wonderful, and I made some great stories of going to various tournaments.

671
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,920
There's a few videos of me floating around, some good, some not so good.

672
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,960
Seems that if it was good, it was good, and if it was bad, it was, well, let's not go

673
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,960
there.

674
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,880
Before I get into it, I do wonder if I'm one of the older listeners out there at age 31.

675
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,120
I know for a fact we do have some listeners above the age of 31, and in fact, you know,

676
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:51,440
our own Dark Sakura is 30, and I'm 28, so not too far away, and Loki, you're what, 26?

677
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,480
We're not that far away.

678
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,280
Bill goes on to say, I just wanted to say that the entire cast does a great job in every

679
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
broadcast.

680
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,280
I started listening to the podcast mainly once after I got a working iPod after going

681
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,440
through about four of them and a creative Zen that went emo and killed itself after

682
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,240
playing the theme song for Evangelion.

683
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,320
I always look forward to each podcast, though I do enjoy your live show more.

684
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,960
There's times I can't make Sunday nights due to other things going on.

685
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,560
What I do enjoy about each show is the fresh insight into gaming, not the standard garbage

686
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,720
that some game magazine's websites tend to publish, but rather one from every man's,

687
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,120
and woman, I haven't forgot about you, Jamie, especially since you're also a Whovian, point

688
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,120
of view.

689
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,200
I recently have classified myself more as a casual gamer of late, not having the time

690
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,680
to play every game out there, nor the finances to purchase every hot new game release, so

691
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,140
I need to be more selective in what I picked up, and I've tended to agree with pretty much

692
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,760
of most of what has been recommended, Elite Beat Agents, Luminous for the Mobile, or two

693
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,840
examples I can think of right away, plunking $40 to $60 per game only to come up disappointed,

694
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,560
and being only able to get the most half of my money back is not a good way to keep a

695
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
living.

696
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,520
I best end this letter before the chat room explodes with people saying to shut the fuck

697
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,520
up and so forth.

698
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,280
In conclusion, great show, guys.

699
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,920
Keep up the work, and see you on the chat rooms whenever I can.

700
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,520
That was a very nice email.

701
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,520
Thank you.

702
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,520
I thought there was a question in it.

703
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,460
Well, I thought there was a question here somewhere, but I guess the older listeners'

704
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,600
part was the question, but that's all right.

705
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,080
We appreciate a nice fuzzy email once in a while that makes us feel good about what we

706
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,840
do and not getting paid for it.

707
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,840
We appreciate it.

708
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,840
You guys are awesome.

709
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,640
Yeah, I'm going to be honest.

710
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,200
A lot of gaming mags and online publications, we've seen it firsthand.

711
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,580
We've heard them talking at the various press events, and what they do is they rehash the

712
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,760
press releases that they're given and turn it into an exclusive, so that's what your

713
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,800
money's going for usually when you're paying for those subscriptions and things.

714
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,440
We on the other hand actually like to play the games before we say anything about it,

715
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,080
or we try to as much as we can.

716
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,400
Next email comes to us from Ricky.

717
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,520
As we upgrade our gaming hardware, we must at some point upgrade our televisions.

718
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,400
To achieve the best display of your next gen system, you must have a really expensive TV.

719
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,680
This kind of goes into your last story.

720
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,900
This is what your average consumer will be slapped in the face with once they purchase

721
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,840
a system and realize that there is only a marginal difference from old gen to new gen.

722
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,960
The only people I know that can discern the differences and meanings of the whole 720i,

723
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,920
1080p thing are the people that talk with the best buyer rep as they are persuaded to

724
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,160
buy a wallet melting television.

725
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,960
In the future, do you think that there will be a particular method of getting the word

726
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,520
out about HD resolutions in the mainstream media, making the info about HD available

727
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,200
to everyone so they can upgrade too?

728
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,560
Your thoughts?

729
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,800
I'm sure they're going to have, well they already have kind of, not really public service

730
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,400
stuff, but they have info.

731
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,880
I think unfortunately what you see now is what you're going to get.

732
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,520
I think since it is best buying those types of places selling the TVs, it is going to

733
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,400
be those folks selling them, obviously trying to sell the most expensive ones and the replacement

734
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,480
plans or whatever, that are going to unfortunately be all there is for most people.

735
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,920
I don't exactly see them running commercials on TV.

736
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:04,160
Maybe in 2007, as I think especially next Christmas, HD TVs are going to be a big, big

737
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,160
deal.

738
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,960
I mean they already are a little bit this Christmas, but next Christmas especially,

739
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,800
I think they're going to be even more affordable, but I don't think you're going to see a lot

740
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,040
of, the brochures and things you're going to see are going to be a best buy.

741
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,960
Circuit City, the place is selling the TVs.

742
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,240
I don't exactly see there being a big public knowledge campaign.

743
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,360
In the end, people are going to look at what's up on the wall and what's showing on the screen

744
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,000
and they're going to go, which one's pretty?

745
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So if a gamer, it's tough for a gamer because they don't show a lot of video games on those

746
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
things.

747
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,400
So it's hard to choose when you're a gamer what type of TV will look best for your games.

748
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,220
You kind of have to base it off whatever in-store feed they have running.

749
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,640
So it makes the choice a little more difficult.

750
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,640
We'll see though.

751
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,640
We could be proven wrong.

752
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,640
Who knows?

753
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,640
Who knows what they'll do.

754
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,640
All right.

755
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,680
Let's go to the next email, which comes to us from Nim.

756
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,520
Hey guys, how's it going?

757
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,320
I haven't been able to listen to your show for a couple of weeks, seeing as I finally

758
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,920
got my hands on BeatMania 2DX and a new girlfriend.

759
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,000
Hey, keep your hands off her.

760
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,160
You may not appreciate that.

761
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,400
No, I'm kidding.

762
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
If you ask, it's okay.

763
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,960
But that's besides the point.

764
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,780
Okay, I feel like touching on a few subjects at hand since I listened to your last podcast.

765
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:14,520
First of all, I'm not sure I quote unquote hate Sony, but I don't think I'm going to

766
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,680
even get a PS3 until they start releasing some better games or some I've heard rumors

767
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,220
about such as Final Fantasy 7 or they start releasing BeatMania 2DX on it.

768
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,680
The war with me is probably going to be with Microsoft and Nintendo here.

769
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,720
The games already released for the 360 look great and I want them badly.

770
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,120
Kind of along the same lines with the Wii, but I'm going to be waiting to get that

771
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,960
because I've been dying to play Brawl since I've heard about it.

772
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,600
What are some of the rumors you've heard about it?

773
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,600
I've heard there were supposedly over 100 characters supposed to be in it.

774
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,280
I highly doubt that, sorry.

775
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,080
Thanks guys, I'll be tuning in hopefully tonight or I'll get your podcast tomorrow.

776
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,200
That comes from Nim.

777
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,200
You know what's interesting though?

778
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,280
You say that the real war is between Microsoft and Nintendo, but I actually disagree because

779
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,200
if Microsoft and Nintendo can pull enough of the share away from Sony, then they could

780
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,720
both effectively claim victory in here.

781
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,120
Let's face it, they were not number one the last time around, so either one of them comes

782
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:11,880
up on top or even goes from number two to number, let's say Nintendo goes from number

783
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,440
three to number two, they're going to be sitting pretty.

784
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,440
Some speculate Nintendo is going to go from number three all the way to number one this

785
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,440
time.

786
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,440
Again, speculation.

787
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:28,000
I'm an analyst, and Xbox 360 is going to stay at number two, but it's going to be

788
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:38,400
a bigger number two than it was the last time around for them, so if they can take more

789
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,680
of Sony's share, then they both can effectively win, you know what I mean?

790
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,480
Any thoughts from you, Loki, on this?

791
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:54,640
Of course, Microsoft say both them and Nintendo take the large share away from Sony.

792
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,240
I'm sure they're not going to settle for number two, so you know, there will be a clear winner

793
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:05,240
I think, but I don't know, I think the 360 is doing pretty good so far where they have

794
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:12,440
kind of something for everybody, although the only casual games I've seen so far, mainly

795
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:18,400
just on Xbox Live Arcade and even, well I guess Viva Pinata would be a casual game,

796
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,400
but it sucks.

797
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,560
I didn't think it was that bad, it's just different.

798
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,760
It's not what you think it is, it's not for kids either, I didn't think a kid could

799
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,920
get into that game, but anyway, that's beside the point.

800
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,540
You know what else is interesting about this time around is I really think it's going

801
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,320
to be different region to region.

802
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,880
I think the UK is fucking pissed at Sony and they're probably not going to forgive them

803
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,880
for it anytime soon, I don't see Sony doing very well there, but I see it doing better

804
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,880
in Japan.

805
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,320
I don't think the 360 is going to come out from third place in Japan anytime soon.

806
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:52,000
Yes, you had Blue Dragon launch recently and yes, we all saw the people camped out in line,

807
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,880
but they need more of that and they need it soon before the Playstation 3 starts delivering

808
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,800
on that or they're going to be screwed.

809
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,320
I think if Xbox really steps it up and puts out some quality stuff along the lines of

810
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,760
those Blue Dragon type things, and it looks like we have the game based on Chopin, what

811
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,960
was that game called, the Tumble Bell or something Bell?

812
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,960
Trusty Bell.

813
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,960
Trusty Bell, thank you, that's coming out.

814
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,240
Some of the other games, maybe they're going in the right direction, but Microsoft needs

815
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,560
to pick it up a little bit or else they're going to get their butt whipped by Sony, at

816
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,560
least in Japan.

817
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:30,000
But I think that's going to be interesting having different rankings throughout the world.

818
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,800
That's what's going to make this generation of consoles different, in my opinion, and

819
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,960
will ultimately affect the next generation of gaming.

820
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,360
Lastly, a quick email.

821
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:46,040
It wasn't signed with a handle, so we'll call him Nick S. Nick S. sent us an email.

822
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,160
Hello, first I would like to compliment you on your podcast, I've been listening for a

823
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,360
few months and love it.

824
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,360
Thank you, appreciate it.

825
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,360
I was wondering what you thought about Gears of War, because I would like to get OLR's

826
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,360
opinions.

827
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,200
PS, every time I'm holding my PSP, I'm always listening to you, OLR, you're all the best

828
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,200
gamers I know.

829
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,200
That's very sweet, thank you.

830
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,160
Gears of War, you know, I thought I talked about this on the show a little bit previously,

831
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,900
but I'll say it again.

832
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:17,040
It's a pretty game, and it's a kick-ass co-op game, but it didn't really click for me.

833
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,920
I'm not feeling all the praise that everybody else is lavishing upon it.

834
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:25,440
It wasn't ultimately very much fun for me, and I got frustrated with the controls.

835
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,960
I felt like I wasn't really understanding what I was doing throughout a lot of the game,

836
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,240
and it's not like I haven't played first-person shooters before, okay, I've played Halo, I

837
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:38,480
beat Prey, you know, well of course any idiot can beat Prey, but you know, it just really

838
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,120
wasn't my kind of game.

839
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:45,240
But I've always been more into music games, action games, you know, first-person shooters

840
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:51,440
have usually been a little lower on what I like, but I didn't enjoy Gears of War as much

841
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,800
as even frickin' Prey I thought was more fun to play for me, and you know, but maybe that's

842
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,400
because Gears of War isn't quite the same traditional shooter, either.

843
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,640
You know, it's cover, shoot, cover, shoot, and a lot of the game has to do with covering,

844
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,560
and maybe I'm just more into the, you know, kamikaze type of playing.

845
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,560
Leeward Jenkins!

846
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,640
I'm that guy, you know?

847
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,560
Well, I wasn't really into the game either, but then again I haven't really played it

848
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:23,160
enough to give a fair shake yet, but my coworker just finally got a 360, and he bought actually

849
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,760
Gears of War as well, and he said that he hasn't been able to pass the first tutorial

850
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,960
stage yet, he says it's fuckin' hard, and he's playing on the simplest difficulty, and

851
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,080
he plays a lot of first-person shooters.

852
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,600
It's not EDI, that even like held me up for a little bit too, I finally got out of the

853
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,620
stupid tutorial level, but I, you know, the first, it's just, I don't know.

854
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,600
Of course, I haven't, now admittedly I have not played enough of the co-op.

855
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,440
I think that's my biggest problem, because that's where most people seem to be lovin'

856
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,320
Gears of War, is co-op, and you know, I'll give it that, you know, I'll trust my friends'

857
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:57,420
assessments on that, and hopefully I'll get some friends someday, and I can play Gears

858
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,420
of War co-op.

859
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,420
That'll be fun.

860
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,580
If I can tear myself away from burnout this week, we'll see.

861
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,580
That's it for the mailbag!

862
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:07,480
If you want to send some emails, we'd love to hear from you, and sorry, you know, we

863
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,240
weren't able to read every email we got this week on the air, but DarkSakura does make

864
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,640
an effort to always read all the email, and you know, when she's out, I'll step in and

865
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,120
try to read and respond to the email.

866
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,600
We'd love to hear from you guys, and it really keeps us going here at Orange Lontredo, so

867
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,600
we appreciate it.

868
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,600
Thanks, you guys.

869
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,600
Back to the news.

870
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:30,440
Anyway, so, I swear to God, I've had so many co-workers come up to me and go, hey, have

871
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:36,680
you heard about those crazy Wii straps breaking, and people breaking their TVs with the Wii

872
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,680
Mode?

873
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,680
And all this...

874
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:47,160
I mean, it's like ridiculous how much this has been spun out of proportion, just... it's

875
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,160
idiots basically throwing the Wii Mode, you know, at 90 miles an hour, and going, why

876
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,120
did it break and smash my TV?

877
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,880
Maybe because you're trying to throw a real 90 mile an hour fastball in baseball when

878
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,520
you really don't have to, and it says in the manual, you know, make the movement slightly.

879
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,040
You don't have to, you know, do it really hard.

880
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:13,760
Anyways, that being said, Nintendo has actually gone ahead and fixed the straps.

881
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:19,720
They're a lot thicker now, and you can actually find them starting with the Australia launch,

882
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,960
and in the Wii Play bundle.

883
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:27,200
They have new straps, and if you really want to, if you've broken your straps, you can

884
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,880
probably buy them on the Nintendo store.

885
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,440
And so, yeah, the new remotes are going to have new straps that will be...

886
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,600
All it is is kind of just a knot tied around the controller.

887
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:42,080
Couldn't you just get your own little, you know, steel cable type thing that won't hurt

888
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,080
your hand?

889
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,120
People have been using fishing line, and just basically have done it that way.

890
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,760
That sounds like it would hurt, though.

891
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,880
You know, because remember, this stuff's going to press up against your wrist.

892
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,880
You don't want anything that's too...

893
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,560
No, replacing the little string that goes from the actual strap to fishing line, so

894
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,560
I'm...

895
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,560
Personally just don't...

896
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,040
Do that crap at your own risk, though.

897
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,040
Exactly.

898
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,040
Or don't throw the damn remote.

899
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,520
I mean, seriously, if you're going to...

900
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,520
Don't let go of it.

901
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,200
You're not supposed to let go of it.

902
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,400
They've got, you know, covers in case, you know, your hands get sweaty, like...

903
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,040
My hands have never gotten that sweaty, I mean, and shit, I...

904
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:21,040
Right before I'm playing the Wii or something, I'm eating, you know, fucking fast food, and

905
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,960
my hands are all greasy from french fries, so if that shit doesn't make the, you know,

906
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,800
the Wii remote fly out of my hands, then nothing will.

907
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:34,800
So if you're really that clumsy and are prone to throwing shit through windows and TVs,

908
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,960
then maybe you shouldn't, I don't know, buy a Wii, or maybe you should duct tape that

909
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,040
shit to your arm, I don't know.

910
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,560
Jeremy Todd, one in our chat room, says a friend bought four new straps on Nintendo's

911
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,080
website for $6.24 including shipping.

912
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,960
Chat dot orange launch radio dot com if you want to leave your own comments.

913
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,320
If you're listening live here on Sunday night, which we tape live 6pm at orange launch radio

914
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,220
dot com every week.

915
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,400
By the way, component cables in stock on their wrist.

916
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,080
I just ordered from Nintendo as well, and I haven't checked the tracking of them, the

917
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,840
last I checked they were in Portland, so I should be getting them next week.

918
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,840
Very excited.

919
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,840
Mine coming Monday.

920
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,840
Very excited.

921
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,840
Then I'm going to play more Zelda.

922
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,160
I've kind of held off from Zelda because I won't play it until it's as pretty as it's

923
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,160
going to get.

924
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,240
I'm stupid like that, don't listen to me.

925
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,820
Black Wolf comments, Nintendo investigating the wrist traps means that they admit there

926
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,880
is a problem which will open themselves up to lawsuits.

927
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,560
Rama counters, I doubt it though, Nintendo said not to be rough with it.

928
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,560
They did send out an email.

929
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,120
Did you get the email from Nintendo this week?

930
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:35,200
I got an email from Nintendo that was posted, bloggers got it too, and it was posted all

931
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,520
over and it said, we hope you're enjoying the Wii, but be careful with it.

932
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:44,680
I didn't get the email, but here, come on, really though, it says like 50,000 times when

933
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,800
you're playing Wii Sports, make sure the wrist strap is securely fastened.

934
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,660
Shouldn't you be taking a break?

935
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,000
Make sure you're not swinging this around wildly.

936
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,160
Be careful of others.

937
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,040
I think they have done everything in their power to make sure that you do not throw that.

938
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,360
If you're just a fucking idiot and want to go ahead and throw your damn remote, you're

939
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,560
the only one to blame.

940
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:09,400
Do not fucking try to sue Nintendo because you were dumb and decided, oh, I'm going to

941
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,520
let go of the remote while I'm bullying and it went through your goddamn TV.

942
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:19,160
I mean, seriously, if you're that stupid, and I imagine there will be someone that sues

943
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:23,040
I didn't know it would fly out of my hand, I thought this tiny piece of string would

944
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,720
keep it from anything.

945
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,240
I thought I could swing it around like a goddamn lasso.

946
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,280
People are so goddamn retarded.

947
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:37,360
Okay, I'm just going to, devil's advocate, do the games encourage this behavior?

948
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:42,440
No, I don't think they do because they show you, even like for example Rayman's Raving

949
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:47,660
Rabbids, when they're showing you how to play it, they show you, you know, holding the remote,

950
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:49,680
they don't show you wildly swinging around.

951
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,340
They show you just kind of making small little movements.

952
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:57,520
The wrist strap is around the goddamn bunny's hand, so it is encouraging the proper use

953
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,520
of this.

954
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:02,480
And nowhere does it say in the game to swing as fast as possible.

955
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,980
It says in the Wii Sports manual, and I know no one reads the manual anymore, but it says

956
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:10,160
it in there to, you know, swing lightly.

957
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,440
You know, you do not need to do, you do not need to swing it wildly.

958
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,560
I don't know what more they could possibly do.

959
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,920
I mean, Wii Sports seems to be the one that's been the biggest culprit.

960
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,340
You know, baseball, because people are trying to throw a fastball, because you don't exactly

961
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:27,600
throw pitches in Zelda, you know, and that's the other huge game right now.

962
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:32,440
So it's basically that game, and it's just people don't get it.

963
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,560
They don't get that you're not actually playing the real thing.

964
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:40,360
You don't need to throw, I mean, and granted when I was playing baseball, you know, I was

965
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:45,440
trying to, you know, throw it hard, but you realize after a little bit, you're all, wait,

966
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,440
I don't need to do that.

967
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,880
I can just kind of flick my wrist, and it does the same thing.

968
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,200
So it's just stupid people.

969
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,480
Alright, well, speaking of...

970
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,480
Ruining it for everyone.

971
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,880
Speaking of stupid, you'd be awfully stupid to buy point cards from Toys R Us, at least

972
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,800
the ones that have been marking up their 2,000 point cards to $24.99.

973
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,320
That's what they're charging on the internet as well.

974
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:12,680
Now keep in mind, 2,000 Wii points, you can buy on your Wii for 20 bucks.

975
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,840
So you'd be kind of dumb to buy this from Toys R Us.

976
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,240
Now Mieklatov, he had to leave the show because he had a pretty bad headache, but I know he

977
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,680
wanted to point out that they were at Best Buy or Target something earlier, and they

978
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,040
saw the same thing going on there.

979
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:29,580
So this isn't just Toys R Us, it's just people have caught Toys R Us because it's online.

980
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:34,280
So a lot of folks are selling these things online for more money.

981
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:40,160
And you know what's actually kind of interesting though, I remember originally when we had

982
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:45,880
our, when we were adding the SKUs for the Wii stuff before launch, the Wii point cards

983
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,880
were $24, $25.

984
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,200
And I was like, what the fuck, that doesn't make any sense because they're supposed to

985
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:55,560
be, you know, it's a dollar for every point, or a penny for every point basically.

986
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,560
And I wouldn't be surprised because the margin, as I mentioned on other shows, the margin

987
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:05,480
of Nintendo products right now because they're trying to make an extreme profit on this stuff

988
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,480
is nothing.

989
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:13,480
I mean, the price that Best Buy probably pays for this stuff is like $16, and they're making

990
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,960
only $4 off of this thing.

991
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,640
Or it might even be even less than that.

992
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:24,960
I think it's really like $2 is what they're making off of this stuff, and even less on

993
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,700
controllers and other stuff.

994
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:31,200
So the fact that they're charging more, you know, granted, yeah, that's not very good,

995
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,360
but the average mom and pop that are buying these things, they don't know how much they're

996
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,720
supposed to cost, and they're going to pay that price.

997
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,200
Do you think Costco would be selling these even cheaper?

998
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,880
Because Costco's notorious for selling things very, very little above cost.

999
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:50,380
Do you think you could possibly get a $19 card at Costco?

1000
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:53,640
You might be able to, I'm not sure though, it depends.

1001
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:58,440
Because if their margins are that small, they might not sell it at a loss, or that little.

1002
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,720
I mean, they might just sell it at the normal price.

1003
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:06,320
But I'm not surprised, though, that you're seeing people charging $24 for these things.

1004
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:12,240
It's just the same reason why you see mad cats charging $60 for fucking component cables,

1005
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,720
when I can buy React's component cables for $19.99.

1006
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,020
Or fuck, they have official Nintendo ones for like $29.99.

1007
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,920
So they're just paying off people who don't know any better?

1008
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:27,920
Yeah, they're paying off people that are buying these stuff as a gift for their kids, or for

1009
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,080
Christmas, and they don't know how much this is supposed to cost.

1010
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:35,600
And I guess their excuse would be, it's a convenience for our customers, because little

1011
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,920
Bobby does not have a credit card.

1012
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,920
So we're...

1013
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,320
And to be honest, I think it's a rip-off to buy them at retail anyways, because you're

1014
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,120
paying tax on $20.

1015
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,120
So just buy it online.

1016
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,280
Well, no, the weird thing is, I could have sworn I saw the Wii in some places was charging

1017
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,280
tax.

1018
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,040
Like I saw a screenshot where somebody was being charged tax on the points, but I'm not

1019
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,060
charged tax here.

1020
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,900
It says you can, there's a tax thing on there.

1021
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:02,320
I'm not sure if it's for that per se, but there's a little tax thing on there where

1022
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,480
you could be charged tax.

1023
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,800
It's like a little spot for it, but so far they're not.

1024
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,480
Maybe they're only taxing if you live in Washington, since that's where they're based?

1025
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,480
I don't know.

1026
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,680
I don't think so, it's...

1027
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,680
I don't know.

1028
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,680
No idea.

1029
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,320
I could swear I saw a YouTube video where someone was being charged tax.

1030
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,320
I don't know.

1031
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,640
Because I remember commenting, oh that sucks, Xbox doesn't charge you tax.

1032
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,760
Like I remember commenting on that, and I was kind of mad at Nintendo, but then when

1033
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,600
I actually went to buy the points, I was not charged.

1034
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,600
I'm stealing a fry.

1035
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,480
If you're going to bring food in here, I'm stealing a fry.

1036
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,480
It's popcorn shrimp.

1037
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,400
Well, I'm still stealing a fry that comes with the shrimp.

1038
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,960
Anyway.

1039
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,560
Moving on, while I chow down here.

1040
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:49,560
So speaking of Nintendo, not a huge surprise.

1041
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,280
They were a little short on their UK Wii shipment.

1042
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,360
Hold on, I'm sorry.

1043
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:00,840
Pennsylvania is being charged the tax, and BlackWolf says I must have seen the video

1044
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:05,880
on Joystiq because they have the tax in Pennsylvania, and that's where I guess the Joystiq video

1045
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,880
came from.

1046
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,680
Possibly, it's one of like 50 game blogs I read, so probably that is where I saw the

1047
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,680
video.

1048
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,680
Interesting though.

1049
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:20,120
Anyways, so they apparently weren't able to ship all the units for the Wii for the launch,

1050
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:27,680
but they are shipping more each week to hopefully be able to catch up before Christmas and get

1051
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,600
as many units out there as possible.

1052
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,720
With the whole launch this year, and even last year with the 360, it's not a big surprise

1053
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:40,280
that they're short, and from what I read, they weren't short by that much.

1054
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:44,200
It was only maybe 1,000 units or whatever.

1055
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,360
It's not too bad.

1056
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:51,240
It's not like the 200,000 units of, say, the PlayStation 3, which couldn't even hit the

1057
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:58,440
200,000 unit mark and ended up being 197,000 units, so whatever.

1058
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:04,640
But hopefully, you know what, UK, at least you're getting the system on time, because

1059
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,840
you sure as hell don't have the PlayStation.

1060
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,240
On time-ish.

1061
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:13,560
On time-ish, but you're still not, I mean, a couple days is a lot better than, say, a

1062
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,560
couple months.

1063
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,560
Well, Nintendo is trying to make nice a little bit.

1064
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:20,160
They have screwed over Europe constantly in the past, but now Europe is viewing this as,

1065
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,040
hey, we're getting screwed again.

1066
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,100
All our consoles are going to the targets in America.

1067
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:29,100
You know I was at GameStop today, I'll say who it was, I don't care, I was at GameStop

1068
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:33,400
today and I heard the clerk tell somebody, we're not really getting the Wiis in a lot,

1069
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,120
you'd have better luck over at Target.

1070
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:39,560
I was like, wow, that's a pretty, it's a good thing I'm not a secret shopper.

1071
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:43,600
I probably would have, you know, FFFF on that guy.

1072
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,400
I was pretty surprised to hear that.

1073
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,880
I tell my customers that shit all the time, like when we had the 360s, when they first

1074
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,880
launched.

1075
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:53,640
I'm like, dude, Best Buy's got them right now, I'm all, you can go down there, pick

1076
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,560
them up, because they were just turning around and selling them for like twice as much to

1077
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:02,280
their customers, but, you know, I helped the guys score a couple Xbox 360s.

1078
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,440
Wow, interesting.

1079
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,440
I thought that was kind of interesting, anyway.

1080
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,760
Well, I hope you folks in the UK are enjoying your system.

1081
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,360
Nobody answered the call last week where we asked some of our British listeners to tape

1082
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,120
folks in line that were waiting for the Wii.

1083
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,580
No, no, they went to other game blogs instead.

1084
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:26,180
We all saw the, you know, Germany crowd and Kotaku and all that other stuff, but nobody

1085
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:30,800
loves us, but that's fine, we'll try not to be too butter over it.

1086
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:36,440
Something that you should be aware of if you are in the CPL, that would be the Cyber Athlete

1087
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,600
Professional League, they're going to be drug testing you at the start of gaming competitions

1088
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,600
next year.

1089
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,960
I'm sorry, that doesn't necessarily mean at the start of every competition, I just mean

1090
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,640
at next year they will be testing for this.

1091
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:51,600
It's kind of interesting because, you know, they're going to be testing for drugs, but

1092
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,920
the comparison people are making is that, wow, it's like real sports.

1093
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,800
Games are becoming closer and closer to being real sports, you know.

1094
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,320
Can steroids enhance your game playing abilities?

1095
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,940
So I suppose, you know, I suppose some drugs could make your reaction times better.

1096
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:11,080
Let me get this very, very clear.

1097
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,720
Video games are not a sport.

1098
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:19,880
They will never, ever, ever be a sport.

1099
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:26,120
This is including anything with the Wii, because granted you're moving around, okay.

1100
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:30,800
The closest thing you may come to a sport, I guess, is Dance Dance Revolution, but that's

1101
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,520
even still not even close.

1102
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,040
Games are not a sport.

1103
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,440
Football is a sport.

1104
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:42,600
Deaf says not even Wii Sports.

1105
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,600
Football is a sport.

1106
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:48,240
Basketball is a sport, you know.

1107
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,920
DARTED SUYA says DDR is a sport.

1108
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,100
Not really.

1109
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,840
In some foreign country out there, what was it?

1110
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,840
Oh, that's right.

1111
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,360
Was it Switzerland or something made it a sport?

1112
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,840
Finland or something, I don't know.

1113
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,160
Sorry, pardon our ignorance, folks.

1114
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,200
We don't remember who it was.

1115
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:07,880
That's kind of a funny story, though, that they're testing for drugs and stuff.

1116
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:17,080
There is another article that missed our cut here, talking about soda highs in gamers.

1117
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:26,000
Apparently caffeine is the gaming drug of choice, and they're talking about the description.

1118
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,560
Caffeine absorption is complete.

1119
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:32,780
Your pupils dilate, your blood pressure rises, and as a response, your liver dumps more sugar

1120
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,720
into your bloodstream.

1121
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,720
That's funny.

1122
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,440
Caffeine is a drug?

1123
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,520
Well, they can't really be testing for caffeine.

1124
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,520
It's a legal drug.

1125
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:48,920
If I want to drink a jumbo-sized coffee before I go play games, that's my right.

1126
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:49,920
It's a legal drug.

1127
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,920
I'm not doing anything wrong.

1128
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,920
True.

1129
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:52,920
I don't know.

1130
01:06:52,920 --> 01:07:00,880
I'd love to see them taking steroids if they throw the remotes through TVs and stuff.

1131
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,880
That'd be hilarious.

1132
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:06,360
I somehow doubt that.

1133
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,920
There's actually some pretty cool stuff.

1134
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:14,040
There was some sort of charity event where they were giving away a custom Guitar Hero

1135
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,720
controller that was made out of a real guitar.

1136
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:23,400
If you're interested in doing that, Kotaku linked to a story which basically has a how-to

1137
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,400
on how you can do that.

1138
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,000
I know this was also run on Hackaday and stuff like that.

1139
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:35,320
The story actually comes from Toolmonger, so if you want to check it out, it's toolmonger.com.

1140
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:39,920
It's how to build your own custom full-size wireless Guitar Hero controller.

1141
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:51,160
It basically requires you to take apart a Guitar Hero controller and an actual guitar.

1142
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,160
Pretty cool.

1143
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,200
You can make some pretty sweet looking guitars from that.

1144
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:59,000
It seems like a lot of money to burn just for a stupid controller.

1145
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,640
It's just two games.

1146
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,080
Well true, but you know what though?

1147
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,080
I'm over Guitar Hero.

1148
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,160
I am so over Guitar Hero, at least until the 360 version.

1149
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,720
I am so over it.

1150
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:19,880
People were buying the full-size arcade units for the Guitar Freaks, the arcade-style controllers.

1151
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,560
Argue if you will, which is the better game, Guitar Freaks or Guitar Hero.

1152
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,720
I don't really care, but at least Guitar Freaks has slightly more games available.

1153
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,720
At least there's what?

1154
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:31,160
Like you have Guitar Freaks V and then you only have four games for it.

1155
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,840
There's Guitar Freaks 3 and 4, Guitar Freaks V, there's a server collection, 3-2.

1156
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:38,920
And the fact that Guitar Freaks had an arcade machine that most people played on before

1157
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:42,800
they played the home version, so people want to recreate that arcade experience at home.

1158
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,720
Guitar Hero had no arcade machine.

1159
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,720
I don't know.

1160
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,360
It just seems a little silly.

1161
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,840
It's a lot of money.

1162
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:58,040
You can feed the starving children, if you think back to the story on the PlayStation

1163
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,040
3 cost.

1164
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:05,280
Anyway, I wanted to point this out as well, speaking of music games.

1165
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,920
Big news in the DDR world this week.

1166
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,840
Not only is DDR now being promoted through Burger King, of all things, did you see the

1167
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:13,840
little toy?

1168
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,380
Miklotov actually got one of the little toys.

1169
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:19,440
It's the Dancing Boldo that you can press the little button and he does the little disco

1170
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,440
dance.

1171
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,440
It's all kinds of stupid.

1172
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:27,880
But the other big news, if you've been following DDR for a couple of years, then you know that

1173
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:32,620
folks were able to find that somewhere on the DDR extreme disk, the song Memories was

1174
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,960
hidden away.

1175
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,120
And people were figuring out for years, how are we going to get this song?

1176
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,940
How's this song supposed to be unlocked?

1177
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:42,560
And everybody thought, oh, maybe it'll be unlocked when Supernova comes out.

1178
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,640
There'll be some type of link data, whatever it is.

1179
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:50,360
Well, turns out, sure enough, this week an unlock code was released through the Burger

1180
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,000
King promotion for Memories.

1181
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,240
So you can finally unlock it legitimately, not using any type of Game Genie style hacks.

1182
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:00,480
You can actually unlock it legitimately in DDR Extreme US.

1183
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:07,240
You just plug a controller in port 2, right 4 times, up 3 times, square 1 time, left 2

1184
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:11,400
times, down 3 times, square 2 times, and select 1 time.

1185
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,600
Hopefully you got all that written down.

1186
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,320
If not, you can go over to Burger King's website for the DDR promotion and play the stupid

1187
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,320
little game they have.

1188
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,480
And when you beat the game, you'll get the code.

1189
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,800
So you can finally have Memories in that game.

1190
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,840
Now here's my thought.

1191
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,280
I don't think they waited two years for this.

1192
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:30,520
I think this is how they've remedied the situation that was created when the link data in Supernova

1193
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,560
kind of fell through, because you notice it was removed from the final version.

1194
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,360
So there's no link data and no Supernova.

1195
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,980
I bet you anything that was how it was supposed to happen.

1196
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:44,880
But because it didn't happen this way, you got the debug code instead.

1197
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:45,880
Makes sense.

1198
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:49,120
I would bet money that that's what happened.

1199
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,620
I would bet money.

1200
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:51,720
And I swear I don't know anything.

1201
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:55,240
I realize we have folks from Konami that come on the program, but they haven't told me anything.

1202
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:58,400
That's my personal thought.

1203
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,320
All right.

1204
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,480
That's all the news we have for you tonight, but we do want to take some of your calls

1205
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,040
because we're an interactive program.

1206
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,040
So why don't you give us a call.

1207
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,040
Are you using?

1208
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,040
Oh.

1209
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,040
I want to do one thing.

1210
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,040
Here.

1211
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,040
Yeah?

1212
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,040
Website of the week.

1213
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,040
Okay.

1214
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,040
Oh, sure.

1215
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,040
Well, then hold on.

1216
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,560
I have to get some theme music for you if you want a website of the week.

1217
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,040
Unfortunately, I don't have Jamie's typical song loaded, so you get this.

1218
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,280
I hate you.

1219
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,280
Anyways.

1220
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,280
Loki's website of the week.

1221
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,320
I thought this would be cool.

1222
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,800
They just ran a story about this thing that they've got going for Nintendo.

1223
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:38,600
It's actually for like a Christmas calendar type thing.

1224
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,600
It's mission-in-snowdriftland.com.

1225
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,600
Drift.

1226
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,600
Yeah.

1227
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,600
Funny.

1228
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:53,040
But it's a bunch of little mini games that you can play, and it's counting down to Christmas.

1229
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:57,080
And I don't know what exactly it is, but each game is kind of like Mario.

1230
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,480
What was the website again?

1231
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:05,760
It's www.mission-in-snowdriftland.com.

1232
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:11,520
They've got a game for each calendar day, and of course, each one is unlocked as the

1233
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,520
day's gone.

1234
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,520
All right.

1235
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,400
Loki's website of the week, boys and girls.

1236
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,960
Temporarily this week's The Stark Soccer is on vacation.

1237
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,240
All right.

1238
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:25,600
Let's go to another call on Skype here.

1239
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,320
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

1240
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:28,320
Who's this?

1241
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,320
Raven's Dolphin.

1242
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,320
Hi, Raven's Dolphin.

1243
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,320
What's on your mind, buddy?

1244
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:39,520
The HDTVs and that lawsuit, I've been actually reading up on it.

1245
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,920
What do you have to say about it?

1246
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:45,000
They just seem like they're just out for money.

1247
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,120
I said it before.

1248
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:53,000
The trigger runs through Bluetooth.ir, and this thing is not motion sensitive.

1249
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:00,320
It's just through this crappy D-pad, and it looks like a smart text phaser.

1250
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:05,480
Why do you think they are, then, if they don't believe that they have this product first?

1251
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:09,200
Why do you think they're going through with this lawsuit, which is not a cheap process?

1252
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:14,880
I know that, but I think the goal is really because they're babies.

1253
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:20,280
I guess the CEO's here, he's going to his kid, I want a Wii, I want a Wii, I can't get

1254
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,280
a Wii.

1255
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,280
So let's sue Nintendo.

1256
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,280
Oh, come on.

1257
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,960
You're thinking because some guy at this company could not get a Wii that they're going to

1258
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:27,960
sue Nintendo?

1259
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:31,080
That's a little bit far-fetched, don't you think?

1260
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:36,320
A little, but it's just, it's this thing, you know, do you believe that they're actually

1261
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,320
going to win?

1262
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,320
I don't.

1263
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:43,560
I don't think so, either, because the controller is a lot more intricate, but, you know, what

1264
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,560
do I know?

1265
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,560
And one more thing.

1266
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,560
Yes?

1267
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,560
Have you even heard of this company?

1268
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,020
Have I even heard of what?

1269
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:52,020
The company.

1270
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,020
The company, literally.

1271
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:54,020
Have you ever heard of it?

1272
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:57,180
No, but they don't make game products, so they don't make something I follow, but apparently

1273
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:02,420
they make PowerPoint push-button thingers for people who give lectures, like myself.

1274
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:05,960
You think I would have heard of them, but mine comes through the projector, which is

1275
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,740
made by, who is our projector, In Focus.

1276
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,600
Here's a question, though, Rob.

1277
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,840
Does the Wii do PowerPoint presentations?

1278
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,280
No, it doesn't.

1279
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,840
Granted, you could probably use the photo channel for that, but that's beyond the point.

1280
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,460
No, I think the fact that the trigger uses Bluetooth and the other one's infrared is

1281
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:22,460
going to be the end of this lawsuit.

1282
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:27,400
The thing is, though, is they have a patent for, like, game controller device or whatever

1283
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,400
like that.

1284
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,720
This is a patent for new remote control for PC.

1285
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:35,320
I think it's going to be completely different, and they're probably going to throw it out

1286
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,320
once this comes in.

1287
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:42,640
Hey, you know what, Raven's Dolphin, Raven's Dolphin, uh, Black Wolf in our chat room is

1288
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:48,680
accusing you of stealing the Wii for the kid joke from his show and is threatening a lawsuit.

1289
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:52,200
Uh, Black Wolf, yeah, I have.

1290
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,200
Oh.

1291
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,200
Ah!

1292
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,200
I'm sorry, Black Wolf.

1293
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,200
Kiss me later.

1294
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:00,360
All right, well, now you have to plug Black Wolf Show, or else we're all getting sued.

1295
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,640
Fine, I'll listen tonight.

1296
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:06,920
Bobby Black Wolf Show, uh, 8 o'clock on Sunday nights before Orange Lounge.

1297
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:07,920
That's 8 o'clock Eastern.

1298
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,920
5 o'clock Pacific.

1299
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:09,920
5 o'clock Pacific.

1300
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,920
All right, there you go.

1301
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,480
All right, uh, any other quick thoughts, Raven's Dolphin, before we get some more call?

1302
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:20,280
Yeah, one quick, uh, if I was going to buy an HDTV, I'm just going to bring in my Xbox

1303
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:24,800
360, hook it up to one of the televisions, and see how it looks on there.

1304
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,400
Tweeter said I could do that.

1305
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,600
Well, then there you go.

1306
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,800
If the store will let you do that, then go for it.

1307
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,800
That's what I'm going to do.

1308
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,040
I'm not going to sit there and go, hmm, does this look good?

1309
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,680
No, I want to see it firsthand.

1310
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,120
All right, well, have fun with that, Raven's Dolphin.

1311
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,720
We got to get some more calls, but thank you so much for your phone call.

1312
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,080
We appreciate it.

1313
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,080
Let's go to some more phone calls here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1314
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,760
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1315
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,760
Who's this?

1316
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,760
Hey, guys.

1317
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,360
This is Footy Monster.

1318
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,360
Hey, Footy Monster.

1319
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,360
What's on your mind, buddy?

1320
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:57,600
I just wanted to go on about the whole Wiimote accident thing.

1321
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,600
Uh, sure.

1322
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,600
What about it?

1323
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:05,880
Well, basically, if they do seem to know about the Wiimote accidents, shouldn't they sue

1324
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:11,320
like baseball-making company persons and like people who play soccer on the street and hear

1325
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:14,640
a person on the head with a ball or something?

1326
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,480
No one's going to get sued over, I mean, have there actually been any lawsuits yet on this

1327
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,480
yet?

1328
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:22,720
I'm not hearing that there actually has been a lawsuit on this yet, but they'd be so stupid

1329
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:27,360
because exactly the point that Footy Monster's bringing up here, you know what?

1330
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:32,080
Accidents with toys happen around the house all the time, and do they get sued over it?

1331
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,320
No, not unless the toy, you know, starts a fire, but that's a little different.

1332
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,720
I haven't heard of any lawsuits yet.

1333
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:43,400
If you actually go to Engadget, there is a picture of a boy who was playing with the

1334
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:49,040
cousins with a Wii, and one of the kids was playing a baseball game, Wii Sports, and hitting

1335
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:55,560
on the head with a Wiimote, and he has a whole mark on his forehead from the Wiimote, and

1336
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,560
it's going to start happening.

1337
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,440
There's going to be parents suing Nintendo about the Wiimote and their children's game.

1338
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:06,080
But at the same time, Wii Sports shows a disclaimer right before you go into the game, and it

1339
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:11,360
even shows the guy spinning around going, make sure there is nothing around you before

1340
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,920
you start playing this game, and that would, you know, include your, you know, little brother.

1341
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,040
So they were at fault for not reading the disclaimer, honestly.

1342
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:25,040
I mean, you know, sucks to be the kid, but, you know, don't run at somebody who's flailing

1343
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,920
their arms about like crazy.

1344
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:27,920
You know?

1345
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,880
Well, it's still, yeah, but it doesn't prevent the bad publicity, I mean, it doesn't prevent

1346
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:36,800
any of the jacky-poos of the world going all over it about how, you know, Nintendo hurts

1347
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,800
children.

1348
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,480
I'll give you that, it doesn't do any good for Nintendo's publicity, but somebody needs

1349
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:46,120
to put their foot down and say, look, Nintendo is not, you know, these guys are just being

1350
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,120
idiots.

1351
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,120
Yeah, I agree.

1352
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:52,920
Well, that's all I wanted to say, and just kind of make it quick, give you a week?

1353
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:53,920
Sure, sure.

1354
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:54,920
Why not?

1355
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:59,560
Okay, my little brother has the chicken pox, I never got him before, so I'm 23 and I'm

1356
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,560
about to get him.

1357
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,560
Uh-oh, run for the hills, you don't want that at the age of 23.

1358
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,840
So you don't get chicken pox, you get shingles, that's always the question.

1359
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:14,120
Oh, yuck, gross, gross, alright, stay far away, we'll pray or something that you don't

1360
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,120
get it.

1361
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,120
Okay, guys.

1362
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:19,680
Alright, have a good one, buddy, and stay away from chicken pox.

1363
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,800
Good to see you guys, thanks.

1364
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,920
Well, I had it when I was seven, so I don't have to worry, did you have chicken pox when

1365
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:25,920
you were younger?

1366
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:26,920
I've never gotten them.

1367
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:27,920
Oh, shit, you better be careful.

1368
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,920
I said I've gotten them four times, I think I'm just...

1369
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,480
How can you get chicken pox four times?

1370
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,320
I don't know.

1371
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,720
Are you sure it's just not Herbie's?

1372
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:34,840
No, it's chicken pox.

1373
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,720
Did you have them four times?

1374
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:41,400
I purposely stayed around her to try to get them, and I never caught them, so I'm immune.

1375
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:47,240
One eight seven seven game O-L-R is our 800 number, or you can call us on Skype, Orange

1376
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:49,600
Lounge Radio is the username.

1377
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:57,160
I've also never had my gallbladder out, and I've also my appendix, and my tonsils are

1378
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:02,160
all in too, and I have all my wisdom teeth too.

1379
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,800
I am one whole person.

1380
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:05,800
Let's go to a call.

1381
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,280
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who this?

1382
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,800
You obviously know who this is, Legend of Zaku.

1383
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,760
Well, hi, Legend of Zaku, but you see it's radio, and on the radio they can't see my

1384
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,240
little Skype screen that shows me who's calling, and to be honest, I usually, I'll just click

1385
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:21,280
the button, and whoever happens to be up gets lucky.

1386
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:25,400
Unless somebody's calling repeatedly throughout the show, I'll not pick them up, but anyway,

1387
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,280
you got lucky, your call got through, what do you want to say?

1388
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:35,600
Well, basically, I want to throw out this question before anything.

1389
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:44,240
Suppose that someone or something, some entity, were supposed to want to create a game on

1390
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:53,760
a mobile cell phone, more like they want to create a rhythm based game, what would be

1391
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,360
the best way, in your honest opinion, on how to approach this?

1392
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:01,600
You don't, not in this country on these phones, don't put out a rhythm based game.

1393
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,520
Wait, wait, wait, no, before you say that, I happen to work with these phones.

1394
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:12,600
Okay, no, I understand, and you know what, phones are almost there, because we have phones

1395
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:16,800
that can play the MP3s and all that stuff, but right now they don't really do it through,

1396
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:21,680
unless you know something I don't, they don't really play the CD quality songs through the

1397
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,960
little Java games.

1398
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,860
Yeah, but that's the thing.

1399
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:29,760
It's not supposed to be that sophisticated, it's supposed to be within the capacity of

1400
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,760
the cell phone.

1401
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:41,080
Now, I'm going to rephrase it, assuming within the maximum capacity of a cell phone, how

1402
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,260
would you approach the situation?

1403
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:49,840
Keep in mind that most phones can't even do simultaneous key presses.

1404
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:55,360
My suggestion then would be not to approach it as a music game, but make it about the

1405
01:20:55,360 --> 01:21:08,440
timing that maybe could be set to music, something along those lines where maybe it's about pressing

1406
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:13,080
the keys at the right time or whatever, but even then, I don't know, I honestly can't

1407
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,840
imagine a game like that being too incredibly thrilling.

1408
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,120
I don't know, maybe if I had some nice visuals or something.

1409
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:24,560
What about feature wise, like internet ranking or downloadable content?

1410
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,960
Sure why not, downloadable stuff, internet, all that stuff is good.

1411
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:34,520
Yeah, basically more like a game and a personalization app at the same time.

1412
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:40,160
Okay sure, I can see, I can look at the rankings or whatever, that's always fun I guess.

1413
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,280
Alright, well there you have it, what was your other question, we've got to keep moving,

1414
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,160
what else was on your mind?

1415
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:51,240
I don't know, I've been talking to Rama recently, and I know this was something else.

1416
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:58,280
By the way, sorry, completely different topic, Rama, I saw Rama on GameTap TV, I was just

1417
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,240
kind of curious what kind of stuff they were showing on GameTap TV, and if you go to their

1418
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:07,200
recent, I don't know, whatever it is that Victor Lucas hosts, the GameTap news thing

1419
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:13,080
or whatever the heck it is, you can see Rama for like a split second in this little montage

1420
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:16,800
of what was going on at the Wii launch, and I would have missed him if it wasn't for the

1421
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:22,360
fact that he's the only black Luigi I know anywhere, so you can spot him on my way.

1422
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:25,840
Anyway, sorry, so about your conversations with Rama.

1423
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:32,880
Let me see, I know we were planning to do, in other words, I don't know if you guys would,

1424
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:39,360
let's say that, to put it this way, I've been having conversations where there's various

1425
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:44,680
other DDR players on something that we plan to do for charity, it hasn't been set in stone

1426
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:51,040
yet, but we need more support and backing, and basically, in the event that this does

1427
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:57,400
happen, I don't know how much support you're willing to give us, if any.

1428
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:01,560
Well we'll consider anything, just send us an email and we'll see what we can do.

1429
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,560
It's a charity thing?

1430
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,560
Right.

1431
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:04,560
Usually we're going to do that.

1432
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:12,060
We're planning to do something along that line, some sort of gaming event for a cause.

1433
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:17,840
Is it more original than the we're going to break the Guinness Book of World Record thing?

1434
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,600
We haven't determined that yet.

1435
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,520
Right now it's in exploratory mode.

1436
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:26,240
All I'm going to say is that if you're going to do the Guinness Book of World Record thing,

1437
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:30,520
that thing's been done like six times now, so please do something to make it more original.

1438
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,520
Okay, good.

1439
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:36,760
We're probably doing something completely different, like a big gathering of gamers.

1440
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:41,360
We don't care about the records as long as we raise money.

1441
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:44,980
Whatever you decide, sure, put it in writing, send it to us, we'll consider anything.

1442
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:48,480
We have some of our listeners that run anime conventions that want us to come, and if we

1443
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:54,160
can reasonably make it, sure, especially if the event is in California, we have an easy

1444
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,160
time making it.

1445
01:23:55,160 --> 01:24:01,080
The whole purpose of this is just to shed the other side of the DDR community, more

1446
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:04,680
the charitable and heartful side of it.

1447
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,680
Sounds good to me.

1448
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:08,320
If we can't be there in person, we can at least send some prizes.

1449
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,520
Well, yeah, whatever you're able to provide us, that'll be cool.

1450
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,520
All right.

1451
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,960
Well, we can't turn this program into a sales pitch, so send me an email and we'll see what

1452
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:15,960
we can do, okay?

1453
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:16,960
All right.

1454
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:17,960
All right.

1455
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:18,960
Zaku, thanks so much for your call.

1456
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:19,960
Have a good one, okay?

1457
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:20,960
Okay.

1458
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:21,960
Bye.

1459
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:22,960
Good luck with your event and your cell phone game.

1460
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:23,960
Yes, Logan?

1461
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:27,720
I'd like to make a mention real quick that you were talking about earlier when we were

1462
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:31,360
discussing the Spike TV video game award winners.

1463
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,600
We didn't really leak them because they just put out for us release with all the winners

1464
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,600
now.

1465
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,600
Oh, well, whatever.

1466
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,160
I mean, every freaking game website had that list anyway.

1467
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,160
It's not like we're telling you anything that revolutionary.

1468
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,720
You know what cell phone game they should work on?

1469
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:52,680
It's called Stop Playing With Your Cell Phone and Drive Your Fucking SUV, The Game.

1470
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:53,680
I like that idea.

1471
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:54,680
All right.

1472
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,800
Thank you guys so much for all your great calls on Skype tonight.

1473
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,640
We are going to close the Skype line at this time.

1474
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,880
Of course, if you didn't get three, you can always leave us a voicemail.

1475
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:07,080
Our voicemail of the week, 1-877-GAME-OLR, and leave us your thoughts.

1476
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:10,960
That's available to the many of you that listen to us on the podcast.

1477
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,960
We appreciate that.

1478
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:12,960
All right.

1479
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:17,120
Loki, any last minute stories?

1480
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,120
Not really.

1481
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,520
Nothing that I really want to mention, I guess.

1482
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,520
I don't know.

1483
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,520
Wow.

1484
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:27,960
I forgot to mention I played, and it was such an impact on me that I forgot the name of

1485
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:28,960
the game even.

1486
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,320
The new Xbox Live Arcade game, RoboBlitz.

1487
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,320
I played that.

1488
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,320
It was okay.

1489
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,320
I played it for like two seconds.

1490
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,320
I didn't get it.

1491
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,320
I didn't buy it.

1492
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,320
I didn't buy it either.

1493
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,320
I played the demo, yeah.

1494
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:40,320
So, yeah.

1495
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,120
I'll give it another try a little later.

1496
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,960
Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood when I played it.

1497
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:44,960
I guess.

1498
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,960
It was interesting.

1499
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:51,560
You know what they really need to put out on Xbox Live Arcade?

1500
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,560
MDK.

1501
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,560
MDK would be awesome.

1502
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,560
That'd be pretty rad.

1503
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,560
I would love MDK.

1504
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,560
All right.

1505
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,360
Well, I guess that's it for the show.

1506
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,360
We're all out of news.

1507
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,440
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.

1508
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:07,880
You guys are awesome for coming and listening to us every week, especially when we've been

1509
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,840
down for a couple weeks, and unfortunately, it's not going to get any better with Christmas

1510
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:11,840
and New Year's on the horizon.

1511
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:16,560
But we appreciate you guys sticking with us as we move into our, if you can believe it,

1512
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:22,600
as of January 2007, our third year of podcasting, and also in 2007, our fifth year of internet

1513
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,600
radio, if you can believe.

1514
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,440
Actually, going into our sixth year, because we're going to hit our fifth birthday in 2007,

1515
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,440
if you can believe it.

1516
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,920
Crazy stuff, huh?

1517
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:33,580
Anyway, that's going to do it.

1518
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,520
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1519
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,360
Gee, my guess will start with my guess, Loki.

1520
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:45,640
My final thought is that popcorn shrimp was delicious.

1521
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:50,200
And my final thought is now everybody's gone to dinner without me, and Dark Sakura's not

1522
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,200
here.

1523
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,320
So we can't go say hi to our favorite waitress at Lion's.

1524
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,320
That makes me sad.

1525
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:58,440
Hi, Jeannie, if you're listening, we love you.

1526
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,440
Thanks again, everybody.

1527
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,440
We'll see you next week.

1528
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,280
We will be live again next week with another program.

1529
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:07,000
I hear it might be the holiday episode, because Dark Sakura was saying something about Chris

1530
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,880
coming back, and Chris wants to do some holiday joy with us, so that should be fun.

1531
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,640
Ho, ho, ho, next week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1532
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,640
We'll see you then.

1533
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:16,640
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
