4
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:21,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:25,522
[SPEAKER_04]: This is episode number 211 for this December the 10th of 2006.

6
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:29,988
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just myself, Rob Roberts, and the one and only Loki here tonight.

7
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:36,538
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura is away in L.A., I guess running around Disneyland or doing whatever girls do when they go to L.A.

8
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:38,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll see you next time.

9
00:00:56,687 --> 00:00:58,968
[SPEAKER_04]: MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

10
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me more friends.

11
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:01,588
[SPEAKER_04]: We want more friends.

12
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:04,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, clips of like old shows are also on there.

13
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes we post announcements as bulletins and fun things like that.

14
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And we won't spam you too much on MySpace.

15
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:11,211
[SPEAKER_04]: We promise.

16
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:12,131
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to start.

17
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:16,833
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to post little pictures when people would add us like a little game related things.

18
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:18,733
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll probably get back into doing that pretty soon.

19
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:21,834
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe give people incentive to add us because we'll comment on you.

20
00:01:23,195 --> 00:01:24,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's my it's.

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,312
[SPEAKER_04]: The only people that have a login for that are myself, Loki, and DarkSakura.

22
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:29,073
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know if you get that, it's one of us doing it.

23
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:30,654
[SPEAKER_04]: So add us on MySpace.

24
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:31,034
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

25
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:32,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

26
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:34,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Do that or we'll kill the ferret.

27
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:36,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's get back into some news.

28
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:48,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so this one website, reghardware.co.uk is saying that Sony is going to ship a major PS3 firmware update in March.

29
00:01:49,205 --> 00:01:50,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And what will it contain?

30
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:52,665
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.

31
00:01:53,426 --> 00:02:04,993
[SPEAKER_03]: But last, SC Europe VP of Technology, Paul Holman, cited by an Australian website, Smart House, said, new features and new gaming capabilities.

32
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:06,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that could be anything.

33
00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:07,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddamn people.

34
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:19,383
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, actually, you know, it's only bad enough that we report on this because it's someone reporting on someone else reporting on something else saying there will be new things coming.

35
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:19,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean,

36
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:23,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is equally the blame?

37
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:26,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's not too much to be surprised here.

38
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:36,839
[SPEAKER_04]: What I think is interesting about this story is that if they do release a big firmware update in March, then it looks like they might be kind of mirroring a little bit what the 360 is doing with their biannual updates, right?

39
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:38,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they have to do the fall update and the spring update.

40
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,961
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what they promise.

41
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:43,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe they were doing that on the old school Xbox as well.

42
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So this would kind of line up with that.

43
00:02:46,884 --> 00:02:47,424
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense.

44
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:50,205
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the rumors, because one of the story rants,

45
00:02:51,252 --> 00:02:51,592
[SPEAKER_03]: The 1080i Fix

46
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:29,087
[SPEAKER_04]: 300 Big Macs or 3000 Bandages 60 Large Cheese Pizzas 250 Gallons of Gas 1988 Mazda 323 You could buy 15 shares of SonyCore You could take a skydiving course and do 4 jumps You could get a personal trainer and do 17 sessions at the gym You could buy 225 pounds of canned tuna

47
00:03:49,208 --> 00:04:00,075
[SPEAKER_04]: or, and it ends here on a nice on note, you could provide food, shelter, and clothing for two children for an entire year and have $150 left over for something nice for yourself.

48
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:04,398
[SPEAKER_04]: What this doesn't address are the eBay profiteers, though.

49
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:05,419
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't factor that in.

50
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:14,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think they should have said, you know, all these eBay profiteers are stealing from the poor defenseless children who have no roof over their head, you bastards.

51
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:15,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of the children.

52
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:16,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

53
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:17,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Why isn't anyone thinking of the children?

54
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:22,424
[SPEAKER_04]: But can you play Resistance on 225 pounds of tuna?

55
00:04:22,544 --> 00:04:23,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I think not.

56
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,907
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what Sony would tell you.

57
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:27,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywho.

58
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:30,170
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't play Ridge Racer with 30 years worth of toothpaste.

59
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:34,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, anyways.

60
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:39,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, definitely time for some wonderful street dates as always.

61
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:47,844
[SPEAKER_03]: And like to start things off like we normally do with some exclusive street dates that you probably haven't heard from any place else.

62
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:49,886
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get going here.

63
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:53,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's a few stories that came out this week with games that are coming out.

64
00:04:54,129 --> 00:05:06,358
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those of course is D3's Simple 2000 series game for the 360 called Earth Defense Force X. And that's coming out on the 360 in the United States on March 21st.

65
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,580
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only going to be retailing for $39.99.

66
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So not bad.

67
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad they're actually bringing out some cool games like that.

68
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:13,904
[SPEAKER_03]: One game that we...

69
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:15,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Death Jam Icon

70
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:42,233
[SPEAKER_03]: on the Wii.

71
00:05:42,494 --> 00:05:44,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that hasn't been said anywhere yet.

72
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,656
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be interesting.

73
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:46,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

74
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:48,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Godfather on the Wii?

75
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:50,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Godfather on the Wii.

76
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,160
[SPEAKER_04]: The fuck?

77
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:53,442
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be fun.

78
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:55,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to play it.

79
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:59,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're going to get to bitch slap someone with a controller and it'll actually work?

80
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:00,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

81
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,788
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be kind of fun, actually.

82
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,090
[SPEAKER_04]: They really do need Grand Theft Auto on the Wii, don't they?

83
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I can't wait.

84
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:09,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be able to pull the hooker out of the car in the real motion and then bitch slap her.

85
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:10,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

86
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Rainbow Six Vegas for the PlayStation 3.

87
00:06:15,182 --> 00:06:19,163
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those wonderful launch titles delayed to March 14th.

88
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:21,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Co-PlayStation 3.

89
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:26,787
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit more difficult to develop for, apparently, than we thought.

90
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:32,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic the Hedgehog also delayed on the PlayStation 3 until January 17th.

91
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:34,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, are they going to make the game fun?

92
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:36,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

93
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:43,607
[SPEAKER_03]: SSX Blur, which is going to be coming out on the Wii, also coming out in March, on March 14th.

94
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:44,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will look pretty cool.

95
00:06:45,028 --> 00:06:45,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait.

96
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:48,390
[SPEAKER_03]: They've cheapified it a little bit, and it looks pretty fun.

97
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the cute little video I think you played on our pre-tape show last week.

98
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:53,172
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked pretty cute.

99
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:53,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

100
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:55,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other stuff.

101
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:58,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Forza 2 has been delayed until May 16th of next year.

102
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:00,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

103
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,597
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some new DS games coming out, including Theme Park.

104
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:08,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Pogo Island Stranglehold Sid Meier's Pirates on the PlayStation Portable February 26th

105
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Charlie Brown All-Stars April 25th

106
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:44,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

107
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:47,210
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, you know, dates are subject to change, as they always are.

108
00:07:47,530 --> 00:08:07,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing I wanted to ask you about, actually, this wasn't anywhere on the show roll, but something we put on orangelaunchradio.com earlier this week is that folks have been spotted on the internet playing DDR Universe on Xbox Live, which would indicate that the game has gone gold, I would believe, or else the achievements and things would not be loaded on Xbox's servers so that we could find them.

109
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,479
[SPEAKER_04]: So, March still?

110
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:10,579
[SPEAKER_04]: So March, yeah.

111
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:11,619
[SPEAKER_04]: You sure?

112
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the game's gone gold.

113
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think this will make the January date?

114
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:14,901
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

115
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:16,461
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

116
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:18,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Still positive it's in March.

117
00:08:18,342 --> 00:08:18,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

118
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,923
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes you so damn sure?

119
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:23,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Their January game is, or actually they don't have a game in January.

120
00:08:23,284 --> 00:08:24,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then there you go.

121
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:24,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Their February.

122
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:26,106
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

123
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:28,647
[SPEAKER_03]: They have, okay, they have games coming out in January.

124
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:29,507
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Yu-Gi-Oh!

125
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:30,007
[SPEAKER_03]: GX.

126
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say Tag Force is coming out.

127
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:35,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, I don't think anything else.

128
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, what if you go to work tomorrow and then, oop, the date got shifted.

129
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:38,691
[SPEAKER_03]: They bumped it up.

130
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,532
[SPEAKER_03]: They normally don't bump stuff up.

131
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:42,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking they're waiting until March.

132
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:45,885
[SPEAKER_03]: March is the big dates for games.

133
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:51,954
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the second push of the, or I guess the first push of the year other than November.

134
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:56,501
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's still going to stick to March.

135
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:58,231
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see.

136
00:08:58,391 --> 00:08:58,932
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see.

137
00:08:58,992 --> 00:08:59,572
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see.

138
00:08:59,592 --> 00:09:00,112
[SPEAKER_03]: We will.

139
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:01,252
[SPEAKER_03]: We will.

140
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:04,034
[SPEAKER_03]: We shall see.

141
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:08,055
[SPEAKER_03]: And just because they're playing it online, hey, remember Pimps at Sea is online right now.

142
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:13,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean he'll... But you couldn't go in and see the little graphics and all the achievements and everything.

143
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:14,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Those weren't loaded on Xbox's servers.

144
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:15,878
[SPEAKER_04]: You couldn't do anything with that.

145
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:17,479
[SPEAKER_04]: It just showed that they were playing Pimps at Sea.

146
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:20,180
[SPEAKER_04]: But with DDR Universe, that's how we were able to get all the achievements.

147
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:22,201
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't mean anything.

148
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:23,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we'll see.

149
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:25,422

[SPEAKER_04]: Hamsters, also coming out on the DS, so that should be fun Star Wars Lethal Alliance on the DS, now that sounds pretty good Superman Returns, the video game on PlayStation 2 Oh, oh, I played the demo of Superman Returns for Xbox 360 Sucked It was more fun to pick up a stranger and try to drop them in the ocean or leave them on the beach and then fly away I had more fun with the whole sandbox element of it than playing the actual game It's pretty bad

154
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:21,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to pick up the full game based off that demo.

155
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:27,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're not supposed to make a final judgment of a game based off a demo, but seriously, don't put it on Marketplace if you don't want people to do that.

156
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:30,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't put my pre-order from based off the demo.

157
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:31,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can't say I blame you.

158
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:36,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, also, The Sims 2 Pets coming out on the PSP, also from EA.

[SPEAKER_03]: And also for the U.S.

162
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:48,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, did I cut you off?

163
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:48,894
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

164
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:50,195
[SPEAKER_03]: No, yeah, it's okay.

165
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:53,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so the U.S., we've got some pretty good releases this week.

166
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:57,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Twilight Princess on the GameCube, you know, for those who may not have a Wii yet.

167
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely worth picking up.

168
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Holdouts.

169
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:00,882
[SPEAKER_03]: All your holdouts.

170
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:04,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Star Trek Legacy, which actually I think that came out last week.

171
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:06,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of this list is wrong.

172
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:08,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, moving on.

173
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:11,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember seeing Star Trek Legacy when I went to the store today.

174
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:13,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was last week.

175
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:16,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It's moved around so many times it's hard for me to remember.

176
00:11:16,603 --> 00:11:19,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Blazing Angels on PlayStation 3.

177
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:24,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Full Metal Alchemist, Dual Sympathy on the DS.

178
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:27,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I hear is supposed to be better than the PlayStation 2 ones.

179
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

180
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Elebits on the Wii.

181
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:33,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to pick that one up.

182
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:34,173
[SPEAKER_03]: That one looks pretty awesome.

183
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get that too, yeah.

184
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:35,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

185
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:37,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

186
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:44,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I do believe on the PC we've got Rayman's Raving Rabbids finally making its way out there.

187
00:11:45,282 --> 00:11:47,263
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see here.

188
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:49,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's actually a few other things on the Wii.

189
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:57,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Slug Anthology, Chicken Little Ace in Action, Rainbow Six Vegas is finally making its way on the PC.

190
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:05,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the PSP we've got Blitz Overtime, which is part of Blitz League.

191
00:12:05,706 --> 00:12:10,893
[SPEAKER_03]: and then, actually, I don't think there's any love for PlayStation 2.

192
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:12,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not too much, at least.

193
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:17,963
[SPEAKER_03]: College Hoops 2K7, which was delayed from the original Xbox and 360 launch.

194
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:21,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, that's a...

195
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,120
[SPEAKER_03]: and many more.

196
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:50,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Earth Defense Forces 3 Full Auto 2 Battle Lines

197
00:13:08,316 --> 00:13:11,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that the US one came out last week.

198
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:15,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so they're getting, I guess, that over in the Asian territories as well.

199
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:19,139
[SPEAKER_04]: MotorStorm, also the Japanese version of MotorStorm, coming out December 14th.

200
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Bastards, we have to wait until March.

201
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:27,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on the Wii, Pokemon Battle Revolution and Rayman Raving Rabbids.

202
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a title based off of Bleach is coming out there as well on the Nintendo Wii.

203
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:35,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on the PlayStation 2,

204
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:38,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Beatmania 2DX, Happy Sky.

205
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:40,533
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of you music game fans have been waiting for that one.

206
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,173
[SPEAKER_04]: That is finally coming out this week, December 14th.

207
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So be on the lookout for that.

208
00:13:45,394 --> 00:13:48,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots and lots of PS2 titles, by the way, coming out this week in Japan.

209
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobunaga no Yabu.

210
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:54,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think that's just going into Best Hits this week.

211
00:13:56,436 --> 00:14:00,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2, also going into the Best Hits.

212
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:05,634
[SPEAKER_04]: and it looks like a lot of games are getting price reductions on the PS2 this week in Japan.

213
00:14:06,474 --> 00:14:07,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out.

214
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:10,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as I mentioned earlier... Wait, one more.

215
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:11,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, one more.

216
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:14,498
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say on the DS, three Rockman games coming out.

217
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:18,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryusei, No Rockman, Dragon, Leo, and Pegasus all coming out December 14th.

218
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what's the funniest game title for this week?

219
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:22,722
[SPEAKER_04]: For the DS?

220
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:24,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for anything.

221
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:27,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

222
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:29,245
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of funny stuff this week.

223
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here we go.

224
00:14:30,814 --> 00:14:34,096
[SPEAKER_04]: and stationary style set DS Lite, although that's not a game.

225
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:35,297
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a set.

226
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:38,019
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a little, you know, like accessory.

227
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

228
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,961
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best I could do.

229
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:40,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

230
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:41,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

231
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:41,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

232
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:42,703
[SPEAKER_04]: No Love Hamster this week.

233
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:42,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

234
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:44,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Love Hamster.

235
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:45,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

236
00:14:45,933 --> 00:15:02,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, as I mentioned earlier, the PlayStation 3 just had a firmware update and was fixing some of the issues that they had with 720p being downscaled to 480p for those people that had older TVs that couldn't do the 720p and only did 1080i.

237
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:11,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently there's a firmware update now, the version 1.3, which actually made attempts to patching that.

238
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:12,482
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes the 1080i

239
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:27,489
[SPEAKER_03]: The default resolution now, and then the 720p is kind of secondary, so for the people that had, you know, the 1080i only HDTVs, you know, kind of fixed some of that.

240
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:38,353
[SPEAKER_03]: However, though, there's still, if you want to watch a Blu-ray movie, the machine will still scale it back, I guess, to 480p, so you have to switch it manually.

241
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:42,755
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like that they've sort of fixed the problem, but not quite fixed it all the way yet, so.

242
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:56,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't it be just simple like the 360 where if it's in 1080i, it stays in 1080i unless I pop in a DVD, which is only going to go to 480p anyways.

243
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:01,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, why can't you just manually select your resolution?

244
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:02,987
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems like it should make sense.

245
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:04,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop trying to think for me.

246
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:14,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know Sony's been taking a lot of heat lately, but slowly but surely we're starting to hear some pretty rad things coming out of Sony, and I think this is pretty awesome.

247
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:21,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though there is no price or date set for this, the PlayStation Network is going to be getting Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.

248
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's pretty rad.

249
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:28,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's according to Famitsu Weekly, and Bandai Namco is going to be releasing this for the download service.

250
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:32,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably Japan will get this first, but at least gives us an idea of what's to come.

251
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:34,858
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

252
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:58,931
[SPEAKER_04]: If they were to go that far with it, shit, they could probably release it as a full game and make pretty good money.

253
00:16:59,371 --> 00:17:03,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be interesting to see how much they charge for this on the PlayStation Network.

254
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:10,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly could be one of the, you know, I think PlayStation's kind of been looking for its geometry wars.

255
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:13,358
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure, you've got Blast Factor and Blow, or Blow.

256
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:14,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Flow.

257
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Flow seems to look pretty cool if you've played the little web application online.

258
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:22,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to live that one down.

259
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:24,626
[SPEAKER_04]: But this could be, like, the, you know, must-have.

260
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,467
[SPEAKER_04]: This, and, like, Gran Turismo HD also coming out in the network.

261
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:30,388
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're going to have some pretty powerful stuff on their network soon.

262
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:33,809
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Sony, and, you know, I guess they got Lemmings this week, too.

263
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:36,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Lemmings, too, and it was a remake.

264
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,990
[SPEAKER_03]: It was completely redone.

265
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:39,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemmings, too, is fun.

266
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:39,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.

267
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:44,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So, slowly but surely, is Sony making some waves in the online scene?

268
00:17:44,173 --> 00:17:47,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I must say, for once, I say good job, Sony.

269
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:48,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

270
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:54,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, Enchanted Arms for the PlayStation 3 is going to be getting some enhancements as well.

271
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,755
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool to see that it's not just a port.

272
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:09,917
[SPEAKER_03]: What they're going to be adding, though, are going to be some graphical tweaks, of course, including new character animations, new chapters to the story, new golems will appear, and the battle system will be improved.

273
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:11,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Will the voice acting be improved?

274
00:18:12,578 --> 00:18:13,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that.

275
00:18:13,398 --> 00:18:17,539
[SPEAKER_03]: It says even the themes for the opening and ending will be recomposed by Mink.

276
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:20,444
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

277
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:50,955
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

278
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:19,818
[SPEAKER_04]: HD DVD has a 46% more positive discussions when it comes to websites than Blu-ray.

279
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:25,482
[SPEAKER_04]: About half as many people are impressed with Blu-ray visuals than are with HD DVD visuals.

280
00:19:25,502 --> 00:19:28,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess these guys are scanning websites to see what people are saying.

281
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:30,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they don't say what websites they're looking at, but whatever.

282
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:39,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what's interesting about this is that they say the key reasons for the low Blu-ray acceptance is the forced inclusion on the PlayStation 3 and PS4.

283
00:19:40,573 --> 00:19:43,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony's previous format reputation.

284
00:19:43,374 --> 00:19:50,456
[SPEAKER_04]: So this might be kind of alluding to the fact that PlayStation 3 might actually be being harmed by the fact that the Blu-ray is a forced thing on it.

285
00:19:51,276 --> 00:19:52,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just like the UMDs.

286
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:54,377
[SPEAKER_03]: UMDs didn't really take off either.

287
00:19:54,397 --> 00:19:55,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

288
00:19:56,178 --> 00:20:02,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we all know why UMDs didn't work because they were charging more than they were for the DVDs and there wasn't as much on them and you couldn't watch them on a TV.

289
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was a stupid format from the beginning, really.

290
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:11,054
[SPEAKER_04]: If they had charged half as much as the DVDs, I bet the format would have done a whole lot better.

291
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:12,435
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole lot better.

292
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:13,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

293
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:16,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

294
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:25,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say, by the way, what a report like this could do is it could make more of those movie studios want to put out HD DVDs, which in the end is going to really hurt Sony.

295
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:26,963
[SPEAKER_03]: It is going to hurt them.

296
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:32,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Because pretty soon it's not going to be... And that's the thing with Blu-ray and HD DVDs.

297
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:42,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anyone's really jumping into it right now either because, okay, I buy a movie that's in, I buy an HD DVD player.

298
00:20:42,994 --> 00:20:46,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now some of my movies are going to be on this format and some of them aren't.

299
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,097
[SPEAKER_03]: So what, I have to buy two different players?

300
00:20:49,237 --> 00:20:50,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that shit.

301
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:51,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I ain't going to buy that stuff.

302
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:55,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's waiting until one format prevails and that's what they're going to buy.

303
00:20:56,581 --> 00:21:01,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf's in chat right now and he's bringing up an interesting point.

304
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:29,564
[SPEAKER_04]: he says HD DVD has a reference DVD that really shows off the power of the format King Kong Blu-ray doesn't really have a comparable reference DVD he says Talladega Nights which you might be thinking not really a good choice because you know King Kong was more of a like action type movie and you know big special effects Talladega Nights you know maybe a few racing scenes here and there but otherwise not exactly a big you know explosions and

305
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:32,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Manly Man Movie to show off the effects.

306
00:21:32,484 --> 00:21:38,388
[SPEAKER_03]: What they need to do is bring out the special edition of Final Fantasy Advent Children.

307
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:40,509
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit would blow people away.

308
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Might not be a bad title for Blu-ray.

309
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,732
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only thing I want Blu-ray for is that movie.

310
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,073
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 says they should have used Snakes on a Plane.

311
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:54,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Snakes on a Plane should be used for reference for anything other than crappy movie.

312
00:21:56,218 --> 00:21:56,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

313
00:21:57,572 --> 00:22:04,817
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the PlayStation 3, Sony is of course talking about improvements that they're possibly going to make to the system as well.

314
00:22:05,518 --> 00:22:14,384
[SPEAKER_03]: They're talking about introducing new third-party applications and hardware, you know, new controller schemes like the Eye of Judgment that's going to suck.

315
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:17,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit, we haven't heard about that in a long time, have we?

316
00:22:17,606 --> 00:22:18,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they went back and made it better.

317
00:22:19,761 --> 00:22:21,002
[SPEAKER_03]: That was supposed to be a launch title.

318
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:22,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever fucking happened to that?

319
00:22:22,422 --> 00:22:22,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know!

320
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:26,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it sucks as a game console peripheral.

321
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:29,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you have to have this giant elaborate setup to play a card game.

322
00:22:29,646 --> 00:22:30,366
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think so.

323
00:22:30,406 --> 00:22:32,027
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not why I'm going to spend my $600.

324
00:22:32,787 --> 00:22:35,108
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the Eye of Judgment.

325
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:37,470
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's how they were always introducing it.

326
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,450
[SPEAKER_04]: The Eye of Judgment.

327
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:45,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they could have gone away with the Brown Eye of Judgment and take a dump on your console.

328
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:46,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um...

329
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:50,295
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of interesting, though, about the whole article.

330
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:57,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one tech site, Smart House, saying that Sony will launch a PlayStation 4, but not any sooner than 2010.

331
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:02,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a second, I thought the PlayStation 3 is future-proof, and it's going to have a 10-year cycle.

332
00:23:04,882 --> 00:23:05,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Oopsies.

333
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:08,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so, duh.

334
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:13,787
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be adding more content and more, you know, stuff like iTunes and...

335
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:15,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Blah, blah, blah.

336
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:19,059
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to basically be the same thing as all the other consoles out there.

337
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:25,545
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to offer download services for video and for music and for games.

338
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,550
[SPEAKER_03]: God, it's not a big surprise.

339
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, unless they said, you know, the PlayStation 4 is going to print money.

340
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:37,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.

341
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:43,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised that Circuit City ad did not say that the DS prints money or something like that.

342
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:50,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep thinking of that picture I've seen all throughout the internet where it says it prints money and has the happy Iwata and Miyamoto.

343
00:23:50,768 --> 00:23:51,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I'm...

344
00:23:53,103 --> 00:23:59,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking about, like, you know, PlayStation 4, and I kind of think about, in my mind, I know it's way too early to think about it, but, like, what could really be better?

345
00:23:59,448 --> 00:24:06,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, graphically, I mean, graphically, these games are starting to look so realistic, it's hard to imagine what could be even better, but, you know, I guess you never know.

346
00:24:06,994 --> 00:24:08,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess I won't know it until I see it.

347
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:13,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I guess a lot of us probably thought the same thing, like, when the NES first came out, like,

348
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:16,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, this is so much better than Atari 2600.

349
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:18,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Games will never look better than this.

350
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:29,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, okay, the PlayStation 4 is going to be able to put out games at fucking 240 frames per second, and it's going to be in full 2160p.

351
00:24:29,461 --> 00:24:32,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but will it have the Eye of Judgment?

352
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:34,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course it will.

353
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:37,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what the Eye of Judgment is going to be used for now?

354
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:39,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Plane checkers.

355
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:44,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Checkers have never been so EXTREME

356
00:24:53,484 --> 00:24:54,065
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

357
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:26,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And can you really imagine yourself, I bought this system and I bought these special cards, which by the way could probably be photocopied and used in the game instead of buying these special decks.

358
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:28,691
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

359
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:53,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I wanted to raise my hand and go, why would you buy this?

360
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:55,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, this is stupid.

361
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:57,540
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tech demo right now.

362
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, leave it as a tech demo.

363
00:25:58,941 --> 00:26:00,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you see it as a launch game.

364
00:26:00,782 --> 00:26:01,802
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's stupid.

365
00:26:03,283 --> 00:26:06,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stop wasting the time on this and produce some better games.

366
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:10,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the brown eye of judgment.

367
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:11,507
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something they should do.

368
00:26:12,848 --> 00:26:14,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seriously, I mean...

369
00:26:15,461 --> 00:26:16,441
[SPEAKER_03]: The Brown Eye of Judgment

370
00:26:48,104 --> 00:26:48,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

371
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:58,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't just imagine with a brown eye of judgment when you're doing so horrible in a game, the console shits itself.

372
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:04,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, you know they have Rumble... My Sony.

373
00:27:05,115 --> 00:27:05,856
[SPEAKER_03]: My Sony.

374
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:08,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Wherever I go, he goes...

375
00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:12,140
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

376
00:27:23,223 --> 00:27:25,284
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how ridiculous this peripheral is.

377
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:32,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I really wish our listeners could have been there at E3 when they're demonstrating this thing, because it was the most ridiculous peripheral.

378
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:37,909
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, didn't somebody in the room, like it was you or somebody, ask like, what the hell's the point of this thing?

379
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:41,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I swear to God, someone asked the question like, what are you going to do with this?

380
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is this it?

381
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:46,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear you asked like, is this it?

382
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:48,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Could I just copy the cards?

383
00:27:49,553 --> 00:27:50,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, what is it?

384
00:27:51,093 --> 00:27:52,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And they raced us out of there.

385
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:57,261
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

386
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:17,550
[SPEAKER_04]: and Stupid Parents.

387
00:28:18,191 --> 00:28:18,771
[SPEAKER_04]: This is interesting.

388
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:31,601
[SPEAKER_04]: A South Carolina woman recently called the cops on her 12-year-old son and had him arrested, charged with petty larceny for stealing a Christmas present from under the tree.

389
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,242
[SPEAKER_04]: What does this have to do with games?

390
00:28:33,563 --> 00:28:35,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was a Game Boy Advance.

391
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:40,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, supposedly, this actually follows a string of crimes committed by the kid.

392
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:44,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoplifting, stealing from mom's wallet, and, oh, punching a cop.

393
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:51,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad that they got him in before it was too late, you know.

394
00:28:52,117 --> 00:28:53,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Next thing you know, he's going to murder someone.

395
00:28:53,778 --> 00:28:55,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Stealing from Santa Claus.

396
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:56,058
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

397
00:28:56,098 --> 00:28:56,858
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big no-no.

398
00:28:57,098 --> 00:28:58,879
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what they should do when they take him into court?

399
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:01,199
[SPEAKER_04]: They should say, so you're into games, huh?

400
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to, instead of having a normal judge, we're going to bring in the brown eye of judgment.

401
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:11,182
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it will decide if it's going to shit on the kid or not.

402
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:12,002
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.

403
00:29:12,022 --> 00:29:13,222
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

404
00:29:13,282 --> 00:29:14,363
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's kind of interesting.

405
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:16,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised they haven't sued Nintendo.

406
00:29:16,776 --> 00:29:21,320
[SPEAKER_03]: The Desire for the Console made him punch a cop

407
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:41,019
[SPEAKER_04]: They were, like, using their authority.

408
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:41,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not surprised.

409
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Respect my authority!

410
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,282
[SPEAKER_04]: And then give me a PlayStation 3.

411
00:29:44,322 --> 00:29:46,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they did that with the 360, too.

412
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:47,805
[SPEAKER_03]: A security guard did the same thing with the 360.

413
00:29:47,965 --> 00:29:49,066
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of messed up.

414
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:49,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

415
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:50,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta have it.

416
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:52,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

417
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:53,951
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why the kid punched the cop.

418
00:29:54,831 --> 00:29:55,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

419
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:58,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Cyborg99 in our chat says, Who buys a Game Boy Advance anymore?

420
00:29:58,314 --> 00:29:59,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a DS instead.

421
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:00,496
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

422
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,138
[SPEAKER_03]: No one buys a Game Boy Advance.

423
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Haven't sold one in ages.

424
00:30:05,077 --> 00:30:17,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywho, so now there's a brand new campaign that's being launched by GameStop, among other people, to kind of educate parents on the ESRB rating system.

425
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:19,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't copy that floppy!

426
00:30:20,428 --> 00:30:21,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, the ratings.

427
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:23,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Rating systems, not copying games.

428
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:34,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so they've launched a brand new website called respecttheratings.com, and it's basically talking about what the ratings mean,

429
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:39,062
[SPEAKER_03]: and how you can enforce them better with your kids.

430
00:30:39,122 --> 00:30:42,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically talking about the different genres of games and stuff.

431
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:55,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Also having a bit, they have some actual terminology on here which is great because they actually define Frag defeating an opponent in a first or third person shooter game.

432
00:30:57,393 --> 00:30:59,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, giblets.

433
00:31:00,195 --> 00:31:03,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiny pieces of what's left of the character one.

434
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:04,983
[SPEAKER_03]: When they meet an unfortunate end.

435
00:31:05,183 --> 00:31:08,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Giblets sounds like something your brown eye of judgment leaves on the counter.

436
00:31:08,644 --> 00:31:09,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Giblets.

437
00:31:12,026 --> 00:31:14,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, you know, just talking about different things.

438
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:15,648
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

439
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:28,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess a good tool for parents, but to be honest, I mean, no matter how many websites like this and how many posters and how many people across the counter tell you,

440
00:31:29,327 --> 00:31:30,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no idea what the M meant!

441
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:31,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it meant it was mm-mm good!

442
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,250
[SPEAKER_04]: M for mom.

443
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:32,710
[SPEAKER_04]: With the tattoo.

444
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:32,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Sigh.

445
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:06,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Jimmy Kimmel had him and his mom on the show last week and gave the kid the entire Oz DVD collection as a reminder of what happens in jail.

446
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not parade this child on your talk show!

447
00:32:11,394 --> 00:32:12,836
[SPEAKER_04]: He's supposed to be punished!

448
00:32:13,577 --> 00:32:14,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, he punched a cop!

449
00:32:16,332 --> 00:32:17,113
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

450
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:44,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And Activision also is hoping folks respect the ratings.

451
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:45,732
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually surveying parents on the ESRB.

452
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:07,519
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

453
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:39,533
[SPEAKER_04]: They did this over a week from Harrison Group, who I've heard of before.

454
00:33:39,573 --> 00:33:43,275
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a pretty respectable surveying group.

455
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:44,756
[SPEAKER_03]: So, interesting.

456
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:45,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, great.

457
00:33:47,037 --> 00:33:48,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there were some interesting guides.

458
00:33:48,838 --> 00:34:05,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I know one of them was posted on Engadget this week, talking about what you need, because definitely one of the big gifts this holiday season is HDTVs, especially with game systems out there, a lot of them requiring high def for better graphics and stuff.

459
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,651
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to need an HDTV at some point.

460
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:08,972
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to get with the times.

461
00:34:09,392 --> 00:34:11,733
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there's a wonderful little guide.

462
00:34:12,013 --> 00:34:18,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this was done by A&E Interactive, part of Mercury News.

463
00:34:18,277 --> 00:34:24,820
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a guide to what gamers need to know when buying an HDTV.

464
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:35,526
[SPEAKER_03]: They go through everything from the basics, including what the different things mean, including 480p, what the progressive versus interlaced means.

465
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:42,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting stuff, including comparisons between flat panel or rear projection, etc.

466
00:34:42,778 --> 00:34:58,791
[SPEAKER_03]: And personally, the other thing, I don't know if it was mentioned on here, but another thing you might want to check also when looking into a TV is websites like IGN, for example, were running lists of HD TVs and possible lag on these TVs.

467
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:01,013
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to check into lag, definitely.

468
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, price-wise, you want to make sure that your TV...

469
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:08,211
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

470
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:34,668
[SPEAKER_04]: because most of these guys are what, like college kids that are trying to pool together the money they've got to buy a good TV?

471
00:35:34,748 --> 00:35:36,048
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're just going to buy something cheap.

472
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:43,492
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were our listeners, what I would do is – and this is how I bought my TV.

473
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:48,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Shopping around, I actually found Newegg.com was pretty cheap.

474
00:35:48,254 --> 00:35:51,896
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a lot of refurbished TVs, and you can buy a refurbished TV.

475
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's last year's model or earlier this year or whatever.

476
00:35:56,565 --> 00:35:58,647
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's still pretty good for the price.

477
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:00,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got like a 37-inch TV.

478
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:03,071
[SPEAKER_03]: It does upwards to 1080.

479
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:06,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually has built-in VGA, DVI, etc.

480
00:36:07,554 --> 00:36:08,055
[SPEAKER_03]: for about $800.

481
00:36:08,255 --> 00:36:10,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't that bad.

482
00:36:10,357 --> 00:36:11,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're only going to come down in price.

483
00:36:11,798 --> 00:36:16,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably if you shop right after Christmas, I think you're going to get a lot of deals that way too.

484
00:36:17,003 --> 00:36:17,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's how I got mine.

485
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:21,186
[SPEAKER_04]: About a year ago, I bought an HDTV at Costco for about $600.

486
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:24,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was a 30-inch widescreen.

487
00:36:24,311 --> 00:36:27,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it was a CRT, so I had a big back, and some things were a little bit blurry on it.

488
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:29,053
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing.

489
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:33,574
[SPEAKER_04]: That thing broke after like a year, but since I bought it from Costco, they'll take it back.

490
00:36:33,914 --> 00:36:35,534
[SPEAKER_04]: So I took it because I still had the receipt.

491
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:36,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I held on to that, baby.

492
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,335
[SPEAKER_04]: So I took it back to Costco.

493
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:45,597
[SPEAKER_04]: They took it back, and for about $100 more, I got an upgrade to a flat 32-inch widescreen TV that's pretty awesome.

494
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:47,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Costco's in-house brand, but you know what?

495
00:36:47,277 --> 00:36:48,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It works great for what I need.

496
00:36:49,258 --> 00:36:50,518
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one I bought, you know, it's...

497
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:52,034
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

498
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:13,558
[SPEAKER_03]: www.DarkSakura.com

499
00:37:39,082 --> 00:38:00,344
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's about it so just really do your research and score pretty good HDTV or if you're really cheap just fucking buy the VGA cables for whatever system you want to play it on and just play it on your TV or your computer monitor that's why I did my 360 before I had an HDTV and it works just good so interesting

500
00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:05,221
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, we're going to get into the mailbag, but first we're going to go to our voicemail of the week.

501
00:38:05,301 --> 00:38:12,286
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to leave us a voicemail, you can always go to... Give us a call after show hours to 1-877-GAME-OLR.

502
00:38:12,326 --> 00:38:13,607
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a toll-free number in the U.S.

503
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,128
[SPEAKER_04]: and Canada.

504
00:38:14,828 --> 00:38:15,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Get this.

505
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:18,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is our voicemail of the week that somebody left.

506
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you guys!

507
00:38:23,315 --> 00:38:23,695
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

508
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:27,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we love you too, but next time leave your name.

509
00:38:28,258 --> 00:38:28,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

510
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:39,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Needless to say, we have not been getting many voicemails of the week, so we are encouraging you guys to leave your thoughts on the program in audio format by giving us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

511
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:41,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to the anonymous listener who was spreading the love there, though.

512
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,252
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

513
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:43,273
[SPEAKER_04]: It inflates our egos.

514
00:38:43,793 --> 00:38:44,253
[SPEAKER_04]: We like that.

515
00:38:44,793 --> 00:38:46,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into our mailbag, boys and girls.

516
00:38:46,614 --> 00:38:48,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

517
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,521
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

518
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:13,796
[SPEAKER_04]: And I forgot to email you guys about it.

519
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:19,199
[SPEAKER_04]: It was during the Wii launch and some people were playing Risk at the front of the waiting line, just like the old gamers back in the day do.

520
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:26,844
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just wondering what board tabletop games would you like to see in the Xbox 360 Marketplace Wii Connect PlayStation 3 online service?

521
00:39:27,245 --> 00:39:28,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally would like to see a couple things.

522
00:39:29,046 --> 00:39:30,046
[SPEAKER_04]: First being Risk.

523
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:33,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to be able to say to the other people, I have Australia, bitches!

524
00:39:34,149 --> 00:39:35,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Or eat that, Kamstaka!

525
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:37,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one would be Monopoly.

526
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:41,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Just seeing people's faces when they land on Park Place with a hotel and if they'd have to pay up.

527
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:44,395
[SPEAKER_04]: The last one would be Candyland.

528
00:39:44,555 --> 00:39:47,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know why, but I bet it would be Microsoft's new Gears of War or Halo 3.

529
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:48,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

530
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:51,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep up the good work and reject false icons.

531
00:39:51,861 --> 00:39:52,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Yuri Lover.

532
00:39:53,062 --> 00:39:56,804
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what board games would you like to see on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox Live?

533
00:39:56,824 --> 00:39:57,225
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

534
00:39:57,605 --> 00:39:58,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I second Monopoly.

535
00:39:58,986 --> 00:40:01,828
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be fun, especially with the Xbox Live Vision camera.

536
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:05,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then you can dress up like Mr. Moneybags.

537
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:07,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think.

538
00:40:08,024 --> 00:40:11,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know you're getting like Settlers of Catan in some of the British games, which is kind of cool.

539
00:40:11,607 --> 00:40:14,589
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also doing Checkers and Chess, I think, at some point, too.

540
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that was with the vision camera.

541
00:40:18,092 --> 00:40:19,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Battleship might be pretty fun.

542
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:25,838
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, actually, it'd be kind of cool to see some other, like... I have one.

543
00:40:25,899 --> 00:40:26,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one.

544
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:27,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Clue.

545
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Clue would be fun.

546
00:40:29,061 --> 00:40:30,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Clue would be awesome.

547
00:40:30,282 --> 00:40:31,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want regular Clue.

548
00:40:31,643 --> 00:40:33,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I want Clue Master Detective.

549
00:40:34,824 --> 00:40:46,487
[SPEAKER_04]: or how about if you could like patch your, like they could, see, you know what Xbox could do is that they could charge you then like, you know, 80 points to download, you know, the Simpsons Clue and, you know, what other Clue games they've done.

550
00:40:46,507 --> 00:40:52,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all the licensed version of Clue that they have and, you know, Cameo Clue and Project Gotham Racing Clue.

551
00:40:53,669 --> 00:40:55,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was the Ford.

552
00:40:56,069 --> 00:41:00,030
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Ford in the Indy Raceway with the carbon monoxide.

553
00:41:01,231 --> 00:41:02,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, maybe that's kind of lame.

554
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:02,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

555
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:03,911
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Dollar Bill

556
00:41:27,113 --> 00:41:28,294
[SPEAKER_04]: of going to various tournaments.

557
00:41:28,514 --> 00:41:31,275
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few videos of me floating around, some good, some not so good.

558
00:41:31,695 --> 00:41:35,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems that if it was good, it was good, and if it was bad, it was, well, let's not go there.

559
00:41:35,396 --> 00:41:39,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I get into it, I do wonder if I'm one of the older listeners out there at age 31.

560
00:41:39,217 --> 00:41:50,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I know for a fact we do have some listeners above the age of 31, and in fact, you know, our own DarkSakura is 30, and I'm 28, so not too far away, and Loki, you're what, 26?

561
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:54,963
[SPEAKER_04]: 26, so we're not that far away.

562
00:41:56,453 --> 00:42:00,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill goes on to say, I just wanted to say that the entire cast does a great job in every broadcast.

563
00:42:00,355 --> 00:42:09,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I started listening to the podcast mainly once after I got a working iPod after going through about four of them in a creative zen that went emo and killed itself after playing the theme song for Evangelion.

564
00:42:10,482 --> 00:42:14,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I always look forward to each podcast, so I do enjoy your live show more.

565
00:42:14,225 --> 00:42:17,367
[SPEAKER_04]: There's times I can't make Sunday nights due to other things going on.

566
00:42:17,888 --> 00:42:20,609
[SPEAKER_04]: What I do enjoy about each show is the fresh insight into gaming.

567
00:42:20,649 --> 00:42:24,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the standard garbage that some game magazines, websites tend to publish, but rather

568
00:42:24,577 --> 00:42:24,897
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

569
00:42:50,427 --> 00:42:54,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Being only able to get the most half of my money back is not a good way to keep a living.

570
00:42:55,411 --> 00:42:59,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I best end this letter before the chat room explodes with people saying to shut the fuck up and so forth.

571
00:42:59,514 --> 00:43:01,115
[SPEAKER_04]: In conclusion, great show, guys.

572
00:43:01,195 --> 00:43:03,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep up the work and see you on the chat rooms whenever I can.

573
00:43:04,237 --> 00:43:05,098
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a very nice email.

574
00:43:05,398 --> 00:43:05,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

575
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:07,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought there was a question in it.

576
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thought there was a question here somewhere, but I guess the older listeners part was the question.

577
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:12,503
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's all right.

578
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:18,788
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate a nice fuzzy email once in a while that makes us feel good about what we do and not getting paid for it.

579
00:43:18,828 --> 00:43:19,369
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

580
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:19,969
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are awesome.

581
00:43:20,812 --> 00:43:22,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email comes to us from Ricky

582
00:43:49,298 --> 00:43:49,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

583
00:44:11,129 --> 00:44:15,653
[SPEAKER_04]: are the people that talk with the Best Buy rep as they are persuaded to buy a wallet-melting television.

584
00:44:16,114 --> 00:44:25,943
[SPEAKER_04]: In the future, do you think that there will be a particular method of getting the word out about HD resolutions in the mainstream media, making the info about HD available to everyone so they can upgrade too?

585
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:26,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Your thoughts?

586
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:35,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they're going to have, you know, well, they already have kind of, not really public service stuff, but like they have info, you know,

587
00:44:35,635 --> 00:44:36,276
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

588
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:04,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I think especially next Christmas, HDTVs are going to be a big, big deal.

589
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:08,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they already are a little bit this Christmas, but next Christmas especially, I think they're going to be even more affordable.

590
00:45:09,058 --> 00:45:14,723
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think you're going to see a lot of, you know, the brochures and things you're going to see are going to be a best buy.

591
00:45:14,823 --> 00:45:16,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Circuit City, the place that's selling the TVs.

592
00:45:17,045 --> 00:45:20,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't exactly see there being a big, you know, public knowledge campaign.

593
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:26,774
[SPEAKER_04]: In the end, people are going to look at what's up on the wall and what's showing on the screen and they're going to go, which one's pretty?

594
00:45:27,964 --> 00:45:32,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's tough for a gamer because they don't show a lot of video games on those things.

595
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:37,946
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard to choose when you're a gamer what type of TV would look best for your games.

596
00:45:38,307 --> 00:45:40,987
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of have to base it off whatever in-store feed they have running.

597
00:45:42,127 --> 00:45:45,028
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes the choice a little more difficult.

598
00:45:45,508 --> 00:45:46,128
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see, though.

599
00:45:46,148 --> 00:45:47,029
[SPEAKER_04]: We could be proven wrong.

600
00:45:47,069 --> 00:45:47,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

601
00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:48,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows what they'll do?

602
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:52,130
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's go to the next email, which comes to us from Nim.

603
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:52,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Nim.

604
00:45:53,663 --> 00:45:54,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, how's it going?

605
00:45:54,664 --> 00:45:59,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been able to listen to your show for a couple weeks, seeing as I finally got my hands on Beatmania 2DX and a new girlfriend.

606
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:01,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, keep your hands off her!

607
00:46:01,908 --> 00:46:03,028
[SPEAKER_04]: She may not appreciate that.

608
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:03,548
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

609
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,169
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ask, it's okay.

610
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:06,690
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's besides the point.

611
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:10,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I feel like touching on a few subjects at hand since I've listened to your last podcast.

612
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:22,679
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I'm not sure I quote-unquote hate Sony, but I don't think I'm going to even get a PS3 until they start releasing some better games, or some I've heard rumors about, such as Final Fantasy VII, or they start releasing Beatmania 2DX on it.

613
00:46:23,168 --> 00:46:26,249
[SPEAKER_04]: The war with me is probably going to be with Microsoft and Nintendo here.

614
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,091
[SPEAKER_04]: The games already released for the 360 look great and I want them badly.

615
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:36,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of along the same lines with the Wii, but I'm going to be waiting to get that because I've been dying to play Brawl since I've heard about it.

616
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:38,295
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the rumors you've heard about it?

617
00:46:38,635 --> 00:46:41,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard there were supposedly over 100 characters supposed to be in it.

618
00:46:41,776 --> 00:46:42,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I highly doubt that, sorry.

619
00:46:43,697 --> 00:46:46,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks guys, I'll be tuning in hopefully tonight or I'll get your podcast tomorrow.

620
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,400
[SPEAKER_04]: That comes from Nim.

621
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:50,900
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's interesting, though?

622
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,502
[SPEAKER_04]: You say that the real war is between Microsoft and Nintendo, but I actually disagree.

623
00:46:54,902 --> 00:47:02,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if Microsoft and Nintendo can pull enough of the share away from Sony, then they could both effectively claim victory in here.

624
00:47:02,565 --> 00:47:14,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's face it, they were not number one the last time around, so either one of them comes up on top, or even goes from number two to number, you know, or from number three, let's say Nintendo goes from number three to number two, you know, they're

625
00:47:16,181 --> 00:47:20,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And some speculate Nintendo's going to go from number three all the way to number one this time.

626
00:47:20,823 --> 00:47:22,263
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, again, speculation.

627
00:47:22,503 --> 00:47:23,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an analyst, okay?

628
00:47:24,304 --> 00:47:32,488
[SPEAKER_04]: And Xbox 360 is going to stay at number two, but it's going to be a bigger number two than it was the last... Sorry, I'm still thinking about the brown-eyed judgment.

629
00:47:32,868 --> 00:47:35,949
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a bigger number two than it was the last time around for them.

630
00:47:36,209 --> 00:47:40,771
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they can take, you know, more of Sony's share, then they both can effectively win.

631
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:41,852
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

632
00:47:42,212 --> 00:47:42,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

633
00:47:42,712 --> 00:47:42,812
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

634
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:44,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Any thoughts from you, Loki, on this?

635
00:47:45,652 --> 00:47:54,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, of course, Microsoft say both them and Nintendo take the large share away from Sony.

636
00:47:54,659 --> 00:48:00,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they're not going to settle for number two, so there will be a clear winner, I think.

637
00:48:01,365 --> 00:48:01,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

638
00:48:02,726 --> 00:48:06,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the 360 is doing pretty good so far, where they have something for everybody.

639
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:09,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Although the only casual games I've seen so far, mainly...

640
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:19,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Just on Xbox Live Arcade and even... Well, I guess Viva Pinata would be a casual game, but it sucks.

641
00:48:19,788 --> 00:48:21,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... I didn't think it was that bad.

642
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:22,770
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just different.

643
00:48:23,288 --> 00:48:24,429
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

644
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:53,264
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

645
00:49:15,562 --> 00:49:15,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick S

646
00:49:44,574 --> 00:49:45,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick S sent us an email.

647
00:49:45,975 --> 00:49:46,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

648
00:49:46,415 --> 00:49:48,577
[SPEAKER_04]: First, I would like to compliment you on your podcast.

649
00:49:48,617 --> 00:49:50,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been listening for a few months and love it.

650
00:49:50,198 --> 00:49:50,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

651
00:49:50,598 --> 00:49:50,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.

652
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:55,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering what you thought about Gears of War because I would like to get OLR's opinions.

653
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:56,322
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

654
00:49:56,442 --> 00:49:59,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I'm holding my PSP, I'm always listening to you, OLR.

655
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:00,846
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all the best gamers I know.

656
00:50:00,986 --> 00:50:01,646
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very sweet.

657
00:50:01,686 --> 00:50:01,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

658
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:03,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Gears of War.

659
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:08,731
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I thought I talked about this on the show a little bit previously, but I'll say it again.

660
00:50:09,832 --> 00:50:13,995
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty game, and it's a kick-ass co-op game.

661
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:15,608
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

662
00:50:22,403 --> 00:50:23,063
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

663
00:50:46,566 --> 00:50:55,288
[SPEAKER_04]: usually been a little lower on what I like, but I didn't enjoy Gears of War as much as even freaking Prey I thought was more fun to play for me.

664
00:50:56,408 --> 00:51:00,109
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe that's because Gears of War isn't quite the same traditional shooter either.

665
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:04,090
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cover, shoot, cover, shoot, and a lot of the game has to do with covering.

666
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:08,451
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe I'm just more into the kamikaze type of playing.

667
00:51:08,491 --> 00:51:09,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Leroy Jenkins!

668
00:51:09,672 --> 00:51:11,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm that guy, you know?

669
00:51:12,254 --> 00:51:33,660
[SPEAKER_03]: well I wasn't really into the game either but then again I haven't really played it enough to give a fair shake yet but my co-worker just finally got a 360 and he bought actually Gears of War as well and he said that he hasn't been able to pass the first tutorial stage he says it's fucking hard and he's playing on the simplest difficulty and he plays a lot of first person shooters

670
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:35,775
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not easy.

671
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:37,816
[SPEAKER_04]: That even held me up for a little bit, too.

672
00:51:37,856 --> 00:51:41,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally got out of the stupid tutorial level, but I... You know, the first... It's just... I don't know.

673
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:45,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I haven't... Now, admittedly, I have not played enough of the co-op.

674
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:50,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's my biggest problem, because that's where most people seem to be loving Gears of War, is co-op.

675
00:51:50,822 --> 00:51:51,743
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I'll give it that.

676
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:54,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll trust my friends' assessments on that.

677
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:58,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully I'll get some friends someday and I can play Gears of War co-op.

678
00:51:58,546 --> 00:51:59,107
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be fun.

679
00:51:59,727 --> 00:52:01,768
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can tear myself away from burnout this week, we'll see.

680
00:52:02,358 --> 00:52:03,359
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for the mailbag.

681
00:52:03,399 --> 00:52:05,400
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send some emails, we'd love to hear from you.

682
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:16,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And sorry, we weren't able to read every email we got this week on the air, but DarkSakura does make an effort to always read all the email, and when she's out, I'll step in and try to read and respond to the email.

683
00:52:16,088 --> 00:52:20,191
[SPEAKER_04]: We love to hear from you guys, and it really keeps us going here at Orange Lawns Radio, so we appreciate it.

684
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:20,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, you guys.

685
00:52:21,192 --> 00:52:21,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to the news.

686
00:52:22,452 --> 00:52:34,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so, I swear to God, I've had so many co-workers come up to me and go, Hey, have you heard about those crazy Wii straps breaking?

687
00:52:34,543 --> 00:52:37,265
[SPEAKER_03]: And people breaking their TVs with the Wii mode?

688
00:52:37,626 --> 00:52:44,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like ridiculous how much this has been spun out of proportion.

689
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:44,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

690
00:52:47,037 --> 00:52:54,640
[SPEAKER_03]: It's idiots basically throwing the Wiimote at 90 miles an hour and going, Why did it break and smash my TV?

691
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:59,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe because you're trying to throw a real 90 mile an hour fastball in baseball when you really don't have to.

692
00:52:59,962 --> 00:53:03,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says in the manual, make the movement slightly.

693
00:53:03,463 --> 00:53:05,124
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do it really hard.

694
00:53:05,744 --> 00:53:08,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, that being said, Nintendo has...

695
00:53:10,752 --> 00:53:13,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually gone ahead and fixed the straps.

696
00:53:13,594 --> 00:53:14,855
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a lot thicker now.

697
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:21,279
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can actually find them starting with the Australia launch in the Wii Play bundle.

698
00:53:21,939 --> 00:53:24,561
[SPEAKER_03]: They have new straps.

699
00:53:24,961 --> 00:53:29,885
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you really want to, if you've broken your straps, you can probably buy them on the Nintendo store.

700
00:53:30,725 --> 00:53:33,227
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, the new remotes are going to have new straps.

701
00:53:33,707 --> 00:53:37,710
[SPEAKER_04]: All it is is kind of just a knot tied around the controller.

702
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:38,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't you just get your own little...

703
00:53:39,847 --> 00:53:40,167
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

704
00:53:59,557 --> 00:54:27,954
[SPEAKER_03]: personally just don't do that crap at your own risk though exactly or don't throw the damn remote I mean seriously if you're gonna don't let go of it you're not supposed to let go of it they've got you know covers in case you know your hands get sweaty like my hands have never gotten that sweaty I mean and shit I right before I'm playing the Wii or something I'm eating you know fucking fast food my hands are all greasy from french fries so if that shit doesn't make the you know the Wiimote fly out of my hands then nothing will so

705
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:36,724
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're really that clumsy and are prone to throwing shit through windows and TVs, then maybe you shouldn't, I don't know, buy a Wii.

706
00:54:37,264 --> 00:54:40,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe you should duct tape that shit to your arm.

707
00:54:40,906 --> 00:54:41,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

708
00:54:42,087 --> 00:54:47,870
[SPEAKER_04]: JeremyTal1 in our chatroom says, A friend bought four new straps on Nintendo's website for $6.24 including shipping.

709
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to leave your own comments.

710
00:54:51,932 --> 00:54:56,174
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're listening live here on Sunday night, which we tape live 6pm at OrangeLaunchRadio.com every week.

711
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:00,912
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, component cables in stock.

712
00:55:00,932 --> 00:55:07,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just ordered from Nintendo as well, and I haven't checked the tracking of them, but last I checked they were in Portland, so I should be getting them next week.

713
00:55:07,714 --> 00:55:08,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Very excited.

714
00:55:08,614 --> 00:55:09,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine coming Monday.

715
00:55:09,555 --> 00:55:10,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Very excited.

716
00:55:10,075 --> 00:55:11,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'm going to play more Zelda.

717
00:55:11,215 --> 00:55:14,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I've kind of held off from Zelda because I won't play it until it's as pretty as it's going to get.

718
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:15,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm stupid like that.

719
00:55:15,877 --> 00:55:16,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't listen to me.

720
00:55:17,217 --> 00:55:23,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf comments, Nintendo investigating the wrist traps means that they admit there is a problem which will open themselves up to lawsuits.

721
00:55:24,837 --> 00:55:25,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt it, though.

722
00:55:25,477 --> 00:55:27,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo said not to be rough with it.

723
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:28,579
[SPEAKER_04]: They did send out an email.

724
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:30,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get the email from Nintendo this week?

725
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:32,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I got an email from Nintendo.

726
00:55:33,723 --> 00:55:35,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Bloggers got it, too, and it was posted all over.

727
00:55:36,425 --> 00:55:38,527
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope you're enjoying the Wii, but be careful with it.

728
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:39,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get the email.

729
00:55:39,287 --> 00:55:40,548
[SPEAKER_03]: But here, I mean, come on.

730
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:41,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, though.

731
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:43,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

732
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:03,457
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the only one to blame.

733
00:56:03,517 --> 00:56:13,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not fucking try to sue Nintendo because you were dumb and decided, oh, I'm going to let go of the remote while I'm bullying and it went through your goddamn TV.

734
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:21,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, if you're that stupid, and I imagine there will be someone that sues, I didn't know it would fly out of my hand.

735
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought this tiny piece of string would keep it from anything.

736
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:27,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I could swing it around like a goddamn lasso.

737
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:28,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

738
00:56:30,026 --> 00:56:32,191
[SPEAKER_04]: People are so goddamn retarded.

739
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:36,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, devil's advocate, do the games encourage this behavior?

740
00:56:37,843 --> 00:56:37,963
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

741
00:56:38,618 --> 00:56:39,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they do.

742
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:44,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they show you, even like, for example, Rayman's Raving Rabbids, when they're showing you how to play it.

743
00:56:44,482 --> 00:56:47,504
[SPEAKER_03]: They show you, you know, holding the remote.

744
00:56:47,644 --> 00:56:49,625
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't show you wildly swinging around.

745
00:56:49,665 --> 00:56:51,966
[SPEAKER_03]: They show you just kind of making small little movements.

746
00:56:52,327 --> 00:56:57,970
[SPEAKER_03]: The wrist strap is around the goddamn bunny's hand, so it is encouraging the proper use of this.

747
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:02,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And nowhere does it say in the game to swing as fast as possible.

748
00:57:02,473 --> 00:57:04,214
[SPEAKER_03]: It says in the Wii Sports manual...

749
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:09,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know no one reads the manual anymore, but it says it in there to, you know, swing lightly.

750
00:57:10,098 --> 00:57:13,280
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you do not need to do... You do not need to swing it wildly.

751
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:16,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what more they could possibly do.

752
00:57:16,622 --> 00:57:19,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and Wii Sports seems to be the one that's been the biggest culprit.

753
00:57:19,864 --> 00:57:22,186
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, baseball, because people are trying to throw fastball.

754
00:57:22,206 --> 00:57:24,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because you don't exactly throw pitches in Zelda, you know.

755
00:57:25,288 --> 00:57:26,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the other huge game right now.

756
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:30,792
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's basically that game, and it's just people...

757
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:32,615
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

758
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,046
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just stupid people.

759
00:57:53,566 --> 00:57:55,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Ruining it for everyone.

760
00:57:55,267 --> 00:58:03,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of stupid, you'd be awfully stupid to buy point cards from Toys R Us, at least the ones that have been marking up their 2,000 point cards to $24.99.

761
00:58:03,868 --> 00:58:06,229
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they're charging on the internet as well.

762
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:11,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, keep in mind, 2,000 Wii points you can buy on your Wii for $20.

763
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:15,171
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you'd be kind of dumb to buy this from Toys R Us.

764
00:58:15,831 --> 00:58:21,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Miklatov, he had to leave the show because he had a pretty bad headache, but I know he wanted to point out that they were at

765
00:58:22,096 --> 00:58:23,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Best Buy or Target, something earlier.

766
00:58:23,557 --> 00:58:24,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And they saw the same thing going on there.

767
00:58:25,017 --> 00:58:26,698
[SPEAKER_04]: So this isn't just Toys R Us.

768
00:58:27,018 --> 00:58:29,280
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just people have caught Toys R Us because it's online.

769
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,341
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of folks are selling these things online for more money.

770
00:58:34,202 --> 00:58:36,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what's actually kind of interesting, though?

771
00:58:38,024 --> 00:58:44,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember originally when we were adding the SKUs for the Wii stuff before launch.

772
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:45,940
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

773
00:59:05,476 --> 00:59:06,496
[SPEAKER_03]: is nothing.

774
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:16,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the price that Best Buy probably pays for this stuff is like $16, and they're making only $4 off of this thing.

775
00:59:16,879 --> 00:59:18,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it might even be even less than that.

776
00:59:18,619 --> 00:59:26,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really like $2 is what they're making off of this stuff, and even less on controllers and other stuff.

777
00:59:26,621 --> 00:59:33,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fact that they're charging more, you know, granted, yeah, that's not very good, but the average mom and pop that are buying these things...

778
00:59:34,235 --> 00:59:37,257
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know how much they're supposed to cost and they're going to pay that price.

779
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:41,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Costco would be selling these even cheaper?

780
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:45,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Costco is notorious for selling things very, very little above cost.

781
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:50,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think you could possibly get a $19 card at Costco?

782
00:59:50,306 --> 00:59:51,387
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be able to.

783
00:59:51,707 --> 00:59:52,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure though.

784
00:59:52,788 --> 00:59:57,951
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends because if their margins are that small, they might not sell it at a loss or that little.

785
00:59:58,471 --> 01:00:00,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they might just sell it at the normal price.

786
01:00:01,505 --> 01:00:06,167
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not surprised though that you're seeing people charging $24 for these things.

787
01:00:06,467 --> 01:00:15,251
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the same reason why you see MadCatz charging $60 for fucking component cables when I can buy React's component cables for $19.99.

788
01:00:16,652 --> 01:00:19,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Or fuck, the official Nintendo ones for like $29.99.

789
01:00:20,934 --> 01:00:22,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're just preying off people who don't know any better?

790
01:00:22,635 --> 01:00:30,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're preying off people that are buying these stuff as a gift for their kids or for Christmas and they don't know how much it's supposed to cost.

791
01:00:30,943 --> 01:00:38,342
[SPEAKER_03]: and I guess their excuse would be it's a convenience for our customers because little Bobby does not have a credit card so we're

792
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:43,310
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, I think it's a rip-off to buy them at retail anyways because you're paying tax on $20.

793
01:00:44,051 --> 01:00:44,891
[SPEAKER_03]: So just buy it online.

794
01:00:44,911 --> 01:00:49,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the weird thing is I could have sworn I saw the Wii in some places was charging tax.

795
01:00:49,393 --> 01:00:54,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I saw a screenshot where somebody was being charged tax on the points, but I'm not charged tax here.

796
01:00:55,056 --> 01:00:57,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It says there's a tax thing on there.

797
01:00:57,938 --> 01:01:03,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if it's for that per se, but there's a little tax thing on there where you could be charged tax.

798
01:01:04,401 --> 01:01:05,742
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a little spot for it.

799
01:01:06,243 --> 01:01:06,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Popcorn Shrimp

800
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:37,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm still stealing a fry that comes with the shrimp.

801
01:01:38,367 --> 01:01:42,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, moving on while I chow down here.

802
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:48,097
[SPEAKER_03]: So, speaking of Nintendo, not a huge surprise.

803
01:01:49,518 --> 01:01:52,081
[SPEAKER_03]: They were a little short on their UK Wii shipment.

804
01:01:53,222 --> 01:01:53,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I'm sorry.

805
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:57,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Pennsylvania is being charged the tax.

806
01:01:58,741 --> 01:02:06,363
[SPEAKER_04]: and BlackWolf says, I must have seen the video on Joystick because they have the tax in Pennsylvania and that's where I guess the Joystick video came from.

807
01:02:06,863 --> 01:02:10,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly, it's one of like 50 game blogs I read, so probably that is where I saw the video.

808
01:02:11,303 --> 01:02:11,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting though.

809
01:02:13,024 --> 01:02:24,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so they apparently weren't able to ship all the units for the Wii for the launch, but they are shipping more each week.

810
01:02:24,605 --> 01:02:25,105
[SPEAKER_03]: and many more.

811
01:02:49,758 --> 01:02:57,141
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, which even, couldn't even hit the 200,000 unit mark and ended up being 197,000 units, so... Whatever.

812
01:02:58,322 --> 01:03:00,423
[SPEAKER_03]: But hopefully, you know, you know what, UK?

813
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,944
[SPEAKER_03]: At least you're getting the system on time.

814
01:03:02,964 --> 01:03:06,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you sure as hell don't have the places... On time-ish.

815
01:03:07,226 --> 01:03:10,067
[SPEAKER_03]: On time-ish, but you're still not... I mean, it's...

816
01:03:10,734 --> 01:03:14,196
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple days is a lot better than, say, a couple months.

817
01:03:14,637 --> 01:03:16,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Nintendo is trying to make nice a little bit.

818
01:03:16,538 --> 01:03:20,961
[SPEAKER_04]: They have screwed over Europe constantly in the past, but now Europe is viewing this as, hey, we're getting screwed again.

819
01:03:21,982 --> 01:03:24,103
[SPEAKER_04]: All our consoles are going to the targets in America.

820
01:03:25,064 --> 01:03:27,406
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I was at GameStop today.

821
01:03:27,426 --> 01:03:28,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say who it was.

822
01:03:28,046 --> 01:03:28,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

823
01:03:28,426 --> 01:03:32,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at GameStop today, and I heard the clerk tell somebody, we're not really getting the wheeze in a lot.

824
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:34,971
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd have better luck over at Target.

825
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:36,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, wow, that's a pretty...

826
01:03:37,851 --> 01:03:39,471
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good thing I'm not a secret shopper.

827
01:04:08,228 --> 01:04:11,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I hope you folks in the UK are enjoying your system.

828
01:04:11,729 --> 01:04:18,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody answered the call last week where we asked some of our British listeners to tape folks in line that were waiting for the Wii.

829
01:04:19,592 --> 01:04:21,472
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, they went to other game blogs instead.

830
01:04:21,532 --> 01:04:25,494
[SPEAKER_04]: We all saw the Germany crowd and Kotaku and all that other stuff.

831
01:04:25,994 --> 01:04:26,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody loves us.

832
01:04:26,874 --> 01:04:27,294
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

833
01:04:27,334 --> 01:04:28,695
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try not to be too butthurt over it.

834
01:04:30,507 --> 01:04:37,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that you should be aware of if you are in the CPL, that would be the Cyber Athlete Professional League.

835
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:42,211
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be drug testing you at the start of gaming competitions next year.

836
01:04:42,251 --> 01:04:44,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, that doesn't necessarily mean at the start of every competition.

837
01:04:44,392 --> 01:04:46,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I just mean at next year they will be testing for this.

838
01:04:48,613 --> 01:04:55,276
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of interesting because they're going to be testing for drugs, but the comparison people are making is that, wow, it's like real sports.

839
01:04:55,736 --> 01:04:58,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Games are becoming closer and closer to being real sports.

840
01:04:58,717 --> 01:04:58,917
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

841
01:04:59,707 --> 01:05:02,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Can steroids enhance your game-playing abilities?

842
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:05,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose some drugs could make your reaction times better.

843
01:05:05,851 --> 01:05:08,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get this very, very clear.

844
01:05:10,753 --> 01:05:14,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games are not a sport.

845
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:19,158
[SPEAKER_03]: They will never, ever, ever be a sport.

846
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:24,801
[SPEAKER_03]: This is including anything with the Wii, because granted, you're moving around.

847
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:27,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the closest thing you may...

848
01:05:28,129 --> 01:05:30,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to a sport, I guess, is Dance Dance Revolution.

849
01:05:30,511 --> 01:05:32,813
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's even still not even close.

850
01:05:34,174 --> 01:05:35,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Games are not a sport.

851
01:05:36,677 --> 01:05:37,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Football is a sport.

852
01:05:37,598 --> 01:05:39,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft says not even Wii Sports.

853
01:05:39,399 --> 01:05:40,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even Wii Sports.

854
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:40,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

855
01:05:42,222 --> 01:05:43,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Football is a sport.

856
01:05:44,103 --> 01:05:45,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Basketball is a sport.

857
01:05:46,045 --> 01:05:46,445
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.

858
01:05:48,247 --> 01:05:50,189
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya says DDR is a sport.

859
01:05:50,829 --> 01:05:51,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

860
01:05:52,151 --> 01:05:52,651
[SPEAKER_04]: In some ways.

861
01:05:53,092 --> 01:05:56,174
[SPEAKER_04]: In some foreign country out there... Oh, that's right.

862
01:05:56,334 --> 01:05:58,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Switzerland or something made it as foreign?

863
01:05:58,155 --> 01:05:58,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Finland or something?

864
01:05:58,655 --> 01:05:59,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

865
01:05:59,496 --> 01:06:01,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, pardon our ignorance, folks.

866
01:06:01,137 --> 01:06:02,077
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't remember who it was.

867
01:06:03,058 --> 01:06:05,920
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a funny story, though, that they're testing for drugs and stuff.

868
01:06:07,781 --> 01:06:16,686
[SPEAKER_03]: There is another article that missed our cut here talking about soda highs in gamers.

869
01:06:17,046 --> 01:06:21,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, caffeine is the gaming drug of choice.

870
01:06:22,359 --> 01:06:24,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're talking about description.

871
01:06:25,661 --> 01:06:27,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Caffeine absorption is complete.

872
01:06:27,482 --> 01:06:28,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Your pupils dilate.

873
01:06:28,723 --> 01:06:30,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Your blood pressure rises.

874
01:06:30,584 --> 01:06:36,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a response, your liver dumps more sugar into your bloodstream.

875
01:06:36,547 --> 01:06:37,148
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

876
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:40,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Caffeine is, well, I mean, caffeine is a drug.

877
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they can't really be testing for caffeine.

878
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:43,331
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's a legal drug.

879
01:06:43,371 --> 01:06:47,053
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to drink a jumbo-sized coffee before I go play games, it's my right.

880
01:06:48,874 --> 01:06:49,555
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a legal drug.

881
01:06:49,595 --> 01:06:50,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not doing anything wrong.

882
01:06:50,435 --> 01:06:51,076
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

883
01:06:51,116 --> 01:06:51,336
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

884
01:06:52,657 --> 01:06:52,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

885
01:06:55,980 --> 01:07:00,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see them taking steroids so that they throw the remotes through TVs and stuff.

886
01:07:01,044 --> 01:07:01,685
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be hilarious.

887
01:07:01,745 --> 01:07:02,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I somehow doubt that.

888
01:07:03,026 --> 01:07:07,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so there was actually some pretty cool stuff.

889
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:16,097
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some sort of charity event where they were giving away a custom Guitar Hero controller that was made out of a real guitar.

890
01:07:17,134 --> 01:07:24,319
[SPEAKER_03]: and well, if you're interested in doing that, Kotaku linked to a story which basically has a how-to on how you can do that.

891
01:07:24,339 --> 01:07:27,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know this was also run on Hackaday and stuff like that.

892
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,604
[SPEAKER_03]: The story actually comes from Toolmonger.

893
01:07:31,624 --> 01:07:42,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to check it out, it's toolmonger.com and it's how to build your own custom full-size wireless Guitar Hero controller and basically requires you to

894
01:07:45,307 --> 01:07:49,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically take apart a Guitar Hero controller and an actual guitar.

895
01:07:50,992 --> 01:07:53,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool that he can make some pretty sweet looking guitars out from that.

896
01:07:55,615 --> 01:07:56,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

897
01:08:17,379 --> 01:08:44,297
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what though, but at least, argue if you will, which is the better game, Guitar Freaks or Guitar Hero I don't really care, but at least Guitar Freaks has slightly more games available At least there's what, like, you have Guitar Freaks V, you only have four games for it There's Guitar Freaks 3 and 4, Guitar Freaks V And the fact that Guitar Freaks had an arcade machine that most people played on before they played the home version So people want to recreate that arcade experience at home Guitar Hero had no arcade machine

898
01:08:46,775 --> 01:08:47,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

899
01:08:49,196 --> 01:08:50,176
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seems a little silly.

900
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:51,556
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of money.

901
01:08:52,777 --> 01:08:54,857
[SPEAKER_04]: You could feed the starving children.

902
01:08:55,638 --> 01:08:58,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Think back to the story on the PlayStation 3 cost.

903
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:04,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I wanted to point this out as well, speaking of music games.

904
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Big news in the DDR world this week.

905
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:12,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only is DDR now being promoted through Burger King, of all things.

906
01:09:12,443 --> 01:09:13,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see the little toy?

907
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov actually got one of the little toys.

908
01:09:15,304 --> 01:09:16,544
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the dancing Boldo

909
01:09:17,302 --> 01:09:19,643
[SPEAKER_04]: You can press the little button and he does a little disco dance.

910
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:21,023
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all kinds of stupid.

911
01:09:21,784 --> 01:09:33,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other big news, if you've been following DDR for a couple of years, then you know that folks were able to find that somewhere on the DDR Extreme disc, the song Memories was hidden away.

912
01:09:33,848 --> 01:09:37,009
[SPEAKER_04]: And people were figuring out for years, how are we going to get this song?

913
01:09:37,069 --> 01:09:38,550
[SPEAKER_04]: How is this song supposed to be unlocked?

914
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:42,532
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody thought, oh, maybe it'll be unlocked when Supernova comes out.

915
01:09:42,552 --> 01:09:44,172
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be some type of link data, whatever it is.

916
01:09:44,532 --> 01:09:45,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it turns out...

917
01:09:47,398 --> 01:09:52,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure enough, this week an unlock code was released through the Burger King promotion for Memories.

918
01:09:52,519 --> 01:09:56,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can finally unlock it legitimately, not using any type of Game Genie style hacks.

919
01:09:57,181 --> 01:10:00,381
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually unlock it legitimately in DDR Extreme US.

920
01:10:00,401 --> 01:10:10,864
[SPEAKER_04]: You just plug a controller in port 2, right 4 times, up 3 times, square 1 time, left 2 times, down 3 times, square 2 times, and select 1 time.

921
01:10:11,405 --> 01:10:12,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

922
01:10:25,436 --> 01:10:54,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is how they've remedied the situation that was created when the link data and Supernova kind of fell through because you noticed it was removed from the final version so there's no link data and no Supernova I bet you anything that was how it was supposed to happen but because it didn't happen this way you got the debug code instead I would bet money that that's what happened I would bet money and I swear I don't know anything I realize we have folks from Konami that come on the program but they haven't told me anything

923
01:10:55,097 --> 01:10:56,458
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my personal thought.

924
01:10:58,339 --> 01:10:58,740
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

925
01:11:00,161 --> 01:11:04,964
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all the news we have for you tonight, but we do want to take some of your calls because we're an interactive program.

926
01:11:04,984 --> 01:11:05,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't you give us a call?

927
01:11:06,145 --> 01:11:07,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do one thing.

928
01:11:07,887 --> 01:11:08,067
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

929
01:11:08,267 --> 01:11:09,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Jamie's not here.

930
01:11:09,588 --> 01:11:10,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Website of the week.

931
01:11:10,909 --> 01:11:11,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

932
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:11,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.

933
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:13,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then hold on.

934
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:16,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to get some theme music for you if you want a website of the week.

935
01:11:16,753 --> 01:11:20,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I don't have Jamie's typical song loaded, so you get this.

936
01:11:23,598 --> 01:11:24,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate you.

937
01:11:25,544 --> 01:11:27,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Loki's website of the week.

938
01:11:28,345 --> 01:11:29,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought this would be cool.

939
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:33,707
[SPEAKER_03]: They just ran a story about this thing that they've got going for Nintendo.

940
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,607
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually for like a Christmas calendar type thing.

941
01:11:37,228 --> 01:11:44,771
[SPEAKER_03]: www.mission-in-snowdriftland.com Drift.

942
01:11:46,331 --> 01:11:46,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, funny.

943
01:11:47,371 --> 01:11:51,973
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a bunch of little mini games that you can play and it's counting down to Christmas.

944
01:11:52,902 --> 01:11:56,284
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't know what exactly it is but each game is kind of like Mario.

945
01:11:57,845 --> 01:11:58,546
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the website again?

946
01:11:59,386 --> 01:12:12,014
[SPEAKER_03]: It's www.mission-in-snowdriftland.com and they've got a game for each calendar day and of course each one is unlocked as the days go on.

947
01:12:13,415 --> 01:12:13,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

948
01:12:14,895 --> 01:12:16,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's website of the week, boys and girls.

949
01:12:18,378 --> 01:12:20,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Temporarily this week since DarkSakura is on vacation.

950
01:12:21,881 --> 01:12:25,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Raven's Dolphin The HDTVs and that lawsuit.

951
01:12:26,045 --> 01:12:27,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been actually reading up on it.

952
01:12:29,008 --> 01:12:30,989
[SPEAKER_01]: People seem like they're just out for money.

953
01:12:31,009 --> 01:12:34,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it before.

954
01:12:47,061 --> 01:12:52,625
[SPEAKER_01]: The trigger runs through Bluetooth, not IR, and this thing is not motion sensitive.

955
01:12:52,925 --> 01:12:58,409
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just through this crappy D-pad, and it looks like a Star Trek phaser.

956
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:08,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you think they are, then, if they don't believe that they have this product first, why do you think they're going through with this lawsuit, which is not a cheap process?

957
01:13:11,021 --> 01:13:14,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know that, but I think they're going to sue him because they're babies.

958
01:13:14,982 --> 01:13:19,243
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the CEO said to his kids, I want a Wii, I want a Wii, I want a Wii.

959
01:13:19,903 --> 01:13:22,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get a Wii, so let's sue Nintendo.

960
01:13:22,524 --> 01:13:23,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, come on.

961
01:13:23,264 --> 01:13:27,985
[SPEAKER_04]: You're thinking because some guy at this company could not get a Wii that they're going to sue Nintendo?

962
01:13:28,286 --> 01:13:29,686
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little bit far-fetched, don't you think?

963
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:34,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a little, but, you know, it's just, so it's this thing, you know.

964
01:13:34,907 --> 01:13:36,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you believe that they're actually going to win?

965
01:13:37,168 --> 01:13:37,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.

966
01:13:38,564 --> 01:13:39,085
[SPEAKER_04]: One more thing.

967
01:13:39,105 --> 01:13:40,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you even heard of this company?

968
01:13:40,406 --> 01:13:41,567
[SPEAKER_04]: This company, Interlink.

969
01:13:41,587 --> 01:13:43,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever heard of it?

970
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:45,812
[SPEAKER_01]: This company, Interlink.

971
01:13:46,092 --> 01:13:46,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever heard of it?

972
01:13:59,076 --> 01:14:02,097
[SPEAKER_04]: push-button thingers for people who give lectures, like myself.

973
01:14:02,357 --> 01:14:07,197
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd think I would have heard of them, but we... Mine comes through the projector, which is made by... Who is our projector?

974
01:14:07,237 --> 01:14:07,738
[SPEAKER_04]: InFocus.

975
01:14:08,598 --> 01:14:09,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a question, though, Rob.

976
01:14:10,398 --> 01:14:13,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the Wii do PowerPoint presentations?

977
01:14:13,639 --> 01:14:14,139
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it doesn't.

978
01:14:14,499 --> 01:14:17,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, you could probably use the photo channel for that, but that's beyond the point.

979
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:22,140
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think the fact that the trigger uses Bluetooth and the other one's infrared is going to be the end of this lawsuit.

980
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:27,841
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is, though, is they have a patent for game controller device or whatever like that,

981
01:14:28,188 --> 01:14:31,649
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a patent for no remote control for PC.

982
01:14:31,789 --> 01:14:36,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be completely different, and they're probably going to throw it out once this comes in.

983
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:38,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know what, RavensDolphin?

984
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:48,252
[SPEAKER_04]: RavensDolphin, BlackWolf in our chatroom is accusing you of stealing the Wii for the Kid joke from his show and is threatening a lawsuit.

985
01:14:50,632 --> 01:14:51,193
[SPEAKER_01]: BlackWolf?

986
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:52,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I am.

987
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:53,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

988
01:14:53,982 --> 01:14:55,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, Blackwood.

989
01:14:55,082 --> 01:14:55,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Kill me later.

990
01:14:56,303 --> 01:15:00,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well now you have to plug Blackwolf Show, or else we're all getting sued.

991
01:15:00,344 --> 01:15:01,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine, I listened to the night.

992
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:06,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobby Blackwolf Show, 8 o'clock on Sunday nights before Orange Lounge.

993
01:15:06,766 --> 01:15:07,727
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 8 o'clock Eastern.

994
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:09,687
[SPEAKER_04]: 5 o'clock Pacific.

995
01:15:10,227 --> 01:15:11,068
[SPEAKER_01]: 5 o'clock Pacific.

996
01:15:11,188 --> 01:15:11,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there you go.

997
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, any other quick thoughts, Raven Stauffen, before we get some more call?

998
01:15:15,502 --> 01:15:24,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one quick... If I was going to buy an HDTV, I'm just going to bring in my Xbox 360, hook it up to one of my televisions, and see how it looks on there.

999
01:15:24,765 --> 01:15:26,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Twitter said I could do that.

1000
01:15:26,686 --> 01:15:27,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then there you go.

1001
01:15:27,586 --> 01:15:29,167
[SPEAKER_04]: If the store will let you do that, then go for it.

1002
01:15:30,647 --> 01:15:31,468
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm going to do.

1003
01:15:31,528 --> 01:15:33,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to sit there and go, hmm, does this look good?

1004
01:15:34,008 --> 01:15:35,629
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I want to see it firsthand.

1005
01:15:36,249 --> 01:15:38,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well have fun with that, Raven Stauffen.

1006
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:40,651
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to go to some more calls, but thank you so much for your phone call.

1007
01:15:40,691 --> 01:15:41,331
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

1008
01:15:44,075 --> 01:15:52,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, this is FootyMonster Hey, FootyMonster, what's on your mind, buddy?

1009
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:59,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to go on about the whole Wimbledon accident thing Sure, what about it?

1010
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:01,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, basically...

1011
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:13,307
[SPEAKER_07]: If they do sue Nintendo about their Wii mode accidents, shouldn't they sue like baseball making company persons and like people who play soccer in the street and hit a person on the head with a ball or something?

1012
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:18,797
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's going to get sued over... I mean, have there actually been any lawsuits yet on this, Loki?

1013
01:16:19,077 --> 01:16:26,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not hearing that there actually has been a lawsuit on this yet, but they'd be so stupid, because exactly the point that FootyMonster's bringing up here, you know what?

1014
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:31,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Accidents with toys happen around the house all the time, and do they get sued over it?

1015
01:16:32,024 --> 01:16:35,727
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not unless the toy, you know, starts a fire, but that's a little different.

1016
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:37,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard of any lawsuits yet.

1017
01:16:39,688 --> 01:16:54,411
[SPEAKER_07]: If you actually go to Engadget, there is a picture of a boy who was playing with the cousins with a Wii, and one of the cousins was playing with a baseball game on the Wii Sports, and hit him on the head with a Wii Remote, and he has a whole mark on his forehead from the Wii Remote.

1018
01:16:55,049 --> 01:16:56,531
[SPEAKER_07]: and, you know, it's going to start happening.

1019
01:16:56,611 --> 01:17:01,097
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be parents going to sue Nintendo about the Wiimote and, you know, their children game.

1020
01:17:01,377 --> 01:17:12,492
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, Wii Sports shows a disclaimer right before you go into the game and it even shows the guy spinning around going, make sure there is nothing around you before you start playing this game.

1021
01:17:12,532 --> 01:17:13,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would...

1022
01:17:13,893 --> 01:17:15,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Include your little brother.

1023
01:17:15,874 --> 01:17:18,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were at fault for not reading the disclaimer, honestly.

1024
01:17:19,095 --> 01:17:27,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, sucks to be the kid, but, you know, don't run at somebody who's flailing their arms about like crazy, you know?

1025
01:17:27,598 --> 01:17:30,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's still, yeah, but it doesn't prevent the bad publicity.

1026
01:17:30,539 --> 01:17:37,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it doesn't prevent, you know, the chatty poos of the world going all over it about how, you know, he can turn the hurt to children.

1027
01:17:37,282 --> 01:17:37,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.

1028
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:46,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you that, it doesn't do any good for Nintendo's publicity, but somebody needs to put their foot down and say, look, Nintendo is not, you know, these guys are just being idiots.

1029
01:17:48,565 --> 01:17:49,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I agree.

1030
01:17:49,485 --> 01:17:52,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's all I wanted to say, and just kind of make a quick FU of it.

1031
01:17:52,386 --> 01:17:52,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, sure.

1032
01:17:53,306 --> 01:17:53,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1033
01:17:55,687 --> 01:18:00,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, my little brother has a chicken pox, I never got him before, so I'm 23 and I'm about to get him.

1034
01:18:00,529 --> 01:18:03,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh, run for the hills, you don't want that at the age of 23.

1035
01:18:04,505 --> 01:18:07,706
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you don't get chicken pox, you get shingles.

1036
01:18:08,326 --> 01:18:08,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yuck.

1037
01:18:08,926 --> 01:18:09,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Gross, gross.

1038
01:18:09,987 --> 01:18:11,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, stay far away.

1039
01:18:11,127 --> 01:18:14,488
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll pray or something that you don't get it.

1040
01:18:16,449 --> 01:18:16,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, guys.

1041
01:18:17,049 --> 01:18:19,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, have a good one, buddy, and stay away from chicken pox.

1042
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:21,030
[SPEAKER_02]: You too, guys.

1043
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:21,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1044
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:24,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I had it when I was seven, so I don't have to worry.

1045
01:18:24,111 --> 01:18:25,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have chicken pox when you were younger?

1046
01:18:25,371 --> 01:18:26,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never gotten them.

1047
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:26,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

1048
01:18:26,932 --> 01:18:28,332
[SPEAKER_03]: You better be careful.

1049
01:18:28,492 --> 01:18:30,493
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you get chicken pox four times?

1050
01:18:30,973 --> 01:18:31,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1051
01:18:32,142 --> 01:18:32,983
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1052
01:18:54,151 --> 01:18:58,054
[SPEAKER_03]: and my tonsils are all in too.

1053
01:18:58,794 --> 01:19:01,876
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have all my wisdom teeth too.

1054
01:19:02,336 --> 01:19:03,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I am one whole person.

1055
01:19:04,358 --> 01:19:05,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to a call.

1056
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:06,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1057
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:07,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1058
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,782
[SPEAKER_00]: You obviously know who this is, Legend of Zaku.

1059
01:19:11,022 --> 01:19:16,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hi Legend of Zaku, but you see it's radio and on the radio they can't see my little Skype screen that shows me who's calling.

1060
01:19:16,866 --> 01:19:20,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, I'll just click the button and whoever happens to be up gets lucky.

1061
01:19:21,115 --> 01:19:24,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless somebody's like calling repeatedly throughout the show, I'll not pick them up.

1062
01:19:24,876 --> 01:19:26,176
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, you got lucky.

1063
01:19:26,196 --> 01:19:26,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Your call got through.

1064
01:19:26,856 --> 01:19:27,336
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to say?

1065
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:33,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically, I've been... Well, I want to throw out this question before, you know, before anything.

1066
01:19:34,397 --> 01:19:49,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Suppose that you want, you know, that someone or something, you know, some entity were supposed to, you know, wanted to create a game on a mobile cell phone, you know, more like they want to create like a, you know,

1067
01:19:50,177 --> 01:19:57,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhythm Base Game What would be the best way, in your honest opinion, on how to approach this?

1068
01:19:57,286 --> 01:19:57,786
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't.

1069
01:19:58,147 --> 01:19:59,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Not in this country on these phones.

1070
01:19:59,949 --> 01:20:01,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't put out a Rhythm Base Game.

1071
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:02,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, wait, wait.

1072
01:20:02,171 --> 01:20:02,211
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1073
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:05,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you say that, I happen to work with these phones.

1074
01:20:05,415 --> 01:20:07,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, no, I mean... I mean...

1075
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:08,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.

1076
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:09,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

1077
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:15,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Phones are almost there because we have phones that can play the MP3s and all that stuff.

1078
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:22,650
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now they don't really do it through, unless you know something I don't, they don't really play the CD quality songs through the little Java games.

1079
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:24,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the thing.

1080
01:20:24,651 --> 01:20:28,074
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not supposed to be that sophisticated.

1081
01:20:28,094 --> 01:20:30,336
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be within the capacity of the cell phone.

1082
01:20:31,036 --> 01:20:32,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, I'm going to rephrase it.

1083
01:20:33,238 --> 01:20:36,661
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, assuming the cell, you know, within the capacity...

1084
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:37,719
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1085
01:21:07,125 --> 01:21:10,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's about pressing the keys at the right time or whatever.

1086
01:21:10,588 --> 01:21:15,712
[SPEAKER_04]: But even then, I don't know, I honestly can't imagine a game like that being too incredibly thrilling.

1087
01:21:15,992 --> 01:21:18,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, maybe they've had some nice visuals or something.

1088
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:20,115
[SPEAKER_00]: What about feature-wise?

1089
01:21:20,855 --> 01:21:24,058
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like internet ranking or downloadable content?

1090
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:25,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, why not?

1091
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:27,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Downloadable stuff, all that stuff is good.

1092
01:21:27,821 --> 01:21:32,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically more like a game and a personalization app at the same time.

1093
01:21:34,426 --> 01:21:34,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sure.

1094
01:21:36,096 --> 01:21:36,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see.

1095
01:21:36,596 --> 01:21:39,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the rankings or whatever.

1096
01:21:39,057 --> 01:21:40,017
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always fun, I guess.

1097
01:21:40,377 --> 01:21:41,197
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, there you have it.

1098
01:21:41,237 --> 01:21:42,298
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your other question?

1099
01:21:42,318 --> 01:21:42,978
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to keep moving.

1100
01:21:43,018 --> 01:21:44,018
[SPEAKER_04]: What else was on your mind?

1101
01:21:45,018 --> 01:21:45,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.

1102
01:21:45,959 --> 01:21:51,160
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking to Ranma recently, and I know this was something else.

1103
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:53,820
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, sorry, completely different topic.

1104
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:56,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma, I saw Ranma on GameTapTV.

1105
01:21:56,992 --> 01:22:00,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just kind of curious what kind of stuff they were showing on GameTapTV.

1106
01:22:00,613 --> 01:22:14,556
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you go to their recent, I don't know, whatever it is that Victor Lucas hosts, the GameTap News thing or whatever the heck it is, you can see Ranma for like a split second in this little montage of what was going on at the Wii launch.

1107
01:22:14,816 --> 01:22:19,817
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would have missed him if it wasn't for the fact that he's the only black Luigi I know anywhere.

1108
01:22:20,737 --> 01:22:21,757
[SPEAKER_04]: You can spot him a mile away.

1109
01:22:21,797 --> 01:22:22,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, sorry.

1110
01:22:22,818 --> 01:22:24,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so about your conversation with Ranma.

1111
01:22:25,781 --> 01:22:43,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see, I know we were planning to do, well, in other words, I don't know if you guys would, let's say that, you know, to put it this way, I've been having conversations with various other DDR players on something that we plan to do for charity.

1112
01:22:43,335 --> 01:22:54,945
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been set in stone yet, but we need more support and backing, and basically, in the event that this does happen, I don't know how much support you're willing to give us.

1113
01:22:57,273 --> 01:22:58,954
[SPEAKER_04]: We're planning to do something along that line.

1114
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:01,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Some sort of gaming event for a cause.

1115
01:23:01,275 --> 01:23:04,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it more original than the we're going to break the Guinness Book of World Records thing?

1116
01:23:17,763 --> 01:23:20,404
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't determined that yet.

1117
01:23:20,464 --> 01:23:22,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's in exploratory mode.

1118
01:23:22,425 --> 01:23:28,348
[SPEAKER_04]: All I'm going to say is that if you're going to do the Guinness Book of World Records thing, that thing's been done like six times now.

1119
01:23:28,388 --> 01:23:30,308
[SPEAKER_04]: So please do something to make it more original.

1120
01:23:30,388 --> 01:23:30,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

1121
01:23:31,269 --> 01:23:36,051
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're probably doing something completely different, like a big gathering of gamers.

1122
01:23:36,731 --> 01:23:38,952
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't care about the records as long as we raise money.

1123
01:23:41,097 --> 01:23:44,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever you decide, sure, put it in writing, send it to us, we'll consider anything.

1124
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:50,002
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some of our listeners that run anime conventions that want us to come, and if we can reasonably make it, sure.

1125
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:54,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if the event is in California, we have an easy time making it.

1126
01:23:54,785 --> 01:24:00,408
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole purpose of this is just to shed the other side of the DDR community.

1127
01:24:00,808 --> 01:24:04,550
[SPEAKER_00]: More the charitable and heartful side of it.

1128
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:05,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good to me.

1129
01:24:05,531 --> 01:24:07,772
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can't be there in person, we can at least send some prizes.

1130
01:24:08,709 --> 01:24:11,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, whatever you're able to provide us, that'll be cool.

1131
01:24:11,711 --> 01:24:11,991
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1132
01:24:12,011 --> 01:24:14,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we can't turn this program into a sales pitch, so send me an email.

1133
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:15,552
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what we can do, okay?

1134
01:24:15,993 --> 01:24:16,293
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1135
01:24:16,453 --> 01:24:16,733
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1136
01:24:17,013 --> 01:24:18,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Saku, thanks so much for your call.

1137
01:24:18,174 --> 01:24:18,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, okay?

1138
01:24:19,294 --> 01:24:19,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1139
01:24:19,675 --> 01:24:19,955
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1140
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:22,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck with your event and your cell phone game.

1141
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:23,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Loki.

1142
01:24:23,436 --> 01:24:30,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to make a mention real quick that you were talking about earlier when we were discussing the Spike TV Video Game Award winners.

1143
01:24:31,331 --> 01:24:35,552
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't really leak them because they just put out a press release with all the winners now.

1144
01:24:36,133 --> 01:24:36,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, whatever.

1145
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:39,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, every freaking game website had that list anyway.

1146
01:24:40,094 --> 01:24:42,034
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like we're telling you anything that revolutionary.

1147
01:24:42,054 --> 01:24:43,975
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what cell phone game they should work on?

1148
01:24:44,655 --> 01:24:48,857
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Stop Playing With Your Cell Phone and Drive Your Fucking SUV.

1149
01:24:49,157 --> 01:24:49,657
[SPEAKER_03]: The game.

1150
01:24:52,758 --> 01:24:53,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that idea.

1151
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:56,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thank you guys so much for all your great calls on Skype tonight.

1152
01:24:56,772 --> 01:24:58,734
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to close the Skype line at this time.

1153
01:24:59,354 --> 01:25:01,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, if you didn't get through, you can always leave us a voicemail.

1154
01:25:01,876 --> 01:25:10,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Our voicemail of the week, 1-877-GAME-OLR and leave us your thoughts and that's available to the many of you that listen to us on the podcast.

1155
01:25:10,903 --> 01:25:11,504
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate that.

1156
01:25:12,124 --> 01:25:14,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki, any last minute stories?

1157
01:25:17,048 --> 01:25:17,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

1158
01:25:17,588 --> 01:25:19,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing that I really want to mention, I guess.

1159
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:19,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1160
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:20,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1161
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:22,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to mention I played...

1162
01:25:25,101 --> 01:25:28,625
[SPEAKER_03]: It was such an impact on me that I forgot the name of the game even.

1163
01:25:28,865 --> 01:25:31,267
[SPEAKER_03]: The new Xbox Live Arcade game, Roboblitz.

1164
01:25:32,368 --> 01:25:32,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that.

1165
01:25:33,009 --> 01:25:33,669
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

1166
01:25:33,729 --> 01:25:34,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it for like two seconds.

1167
01:25:34,910 --> 01:25:35,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get it.

1168
01:25:36,192 --> 01:25:36,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't buy it.

1169
01:25:37,353 --> 01:25:38,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't buy it either.

1170
01:25:38,153 --> 01:25:38,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the demo.

1171
01:25:38,974 --> 01:25:40,435
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

1172
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it another try a little later.

1173
01:25:42,117 --> 01:25:43,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood when I played it.

1174
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:44,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

1175
01:25:44,679 --> 01:25:46,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It was interesting.

1176
01:25:46,721 --> 01:25:46,961
[SPEAKER_03]: It was...

1177
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:50,612
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what they really need to put out on Xbox Live Arcade?

1178
01:25:51,032 --> 01:25:51,533
[SPEAKER_03]: MDK.

1179
01:25:51,893 --> 01:25:53,034
[SPEAKER_03]: MDK would be awesome.

1180
01:25:53,174 --> 01:25:53,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be pretty rad.

1181
01:25:54,154 --> 01:25:54,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love MDK.

1182
01:25:55,355 --> 01:25:55,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1183
01:25:56,016 --> 01:25:57,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess that's it for the show.

1184
01:25:58,197 --> 01:25:58,978
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all out of news.

1185
01:25:59,538 --> 01:26:02,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.

1186
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,280
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are awesome.

1187
01:26:04,585 --> 01:26:05,406
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1188
01:26:32,799 --> 01:26:33,419
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it.

1189
01:26:33,459 --> 01:26:35,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1190
01:26:35,521 --> 01:26:39,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Gee, I guess we'll start with, I guess, Loki.

1191
01:26:40,304 --> 01:26:44,186
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is that popcorn shrimp was delicious.

1192
01:26:45,547 --> 01:26:50,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And my final thought is now everybody's gone to dinner without me and DarkSakura's not here.

1193
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:53,212
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can't go say hi to our favorite waitress at Lions.

1194
01:26:53,232 --> 01:26:54,033
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me sad.

1195
01:26:54,613 --> 01:26:55,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Jeannie, if you're listening.

1196
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:56,174
[SPEAKER_04]: We love you.

1197
01:26:58,322 --> 01:27:00,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again everybody and we'll see you next week.

1198
01:27:00,183 --> 01:27:02,263
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be live again next week with another program.

1199
01:27:02,663 --> 01:27:10,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear it might be the holiday episode because DarkSakura was saying something about Chris coming back and Chris wants to do some holiday joy with us.

1200
01:27:10,706 --> 01:27:11,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So that should be fun.

1201
01:27:12,106 --> 01:27:14,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Ho, ho, ho next week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1202
01:27:14,607 --> 01:27:15,207
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you then.

01:27:18,668 --> 01:27:20,869
