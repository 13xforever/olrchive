13772	24766	Tonight, December 10th, 2006, Microsoft gets sued over Brick 360s, the old Apple entering the console market rumor resurfaces, and is the PlayStation 3 harming the acceptance of Blu-ray?
32096	36919	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36979	42722	We are that video game program dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43163	52008	My name is Rob Roberts and unfortunately not joining us this week is DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, but we do have the ferret to speak for her in her place.
55369	56430	She's actually in L.A.
56470	56871	this week.
56931	59573	She's spinning around on the teacups back at Disneyland.
59593	60254	I know, again?
60534	61515	She's at Disneyland again?
61935	63957	Well, she's there with Chris and, oh well.
64418	65579	She's not here this week.
66239	70323	She was going to call in with a special report, but I guess she got too dizzy because I didn't see anything on the Skype line.
70363	71785	So maybe she'll bug us later.
71845	72145	I don't know.
72165	75168	But in the meantime, the one and only Loki is joining us here tonight.
76129	76629	Yes, I am.
77149	77450	All right.
77490	77990	How you doing?
78611	79231	I'm doing okay.
79552	79832	All right.
80356	84818	It's kind of weird because we haven't been live in a while, like since before Thanksgiving.
84858	88380	You know, we missed that show Thanksgiving week and then we were pre-taped last week.
88981	95064	And now this week, it doesn't feel like a full thing because it's just you and me and there's no DarkSakura.
95344	99567	There's no special guest yet, although supposedly Miklatov's going to be here.
100487	106390	But like an hour before we went live, they were like, Bye, we're going to go play DDR at the bowling alley.
106931	107351	And I'm like...
108424	108704	Viva Pi√±ata
136863	146045	until which the game decided I don't want to play it anymore, which is ironic because I really didn't want to play it anymore because, well, it froze up on me.
146605	150126	And the game itself was just very kind of boring.
150626	156307	I mean, I got really bored with it really quick, so I plan on selling it back since I didn't pay for it in the first place.
156447	158608	So, I don't know, can't recommend it.
158848	161528	But I guess if you stick with it long enough, it might be fun.
161708	164189	I just found it very, very, very annoying, so.
164875	165155	Whatever.
165776	167457	Played more Excite Truck, because that's fun.
167517	168537	Played more Wii Sports.
169438	177282	We've been doing more of the Wii Sports bowling, and my friend who's used to being in a bowling league was kicking our ass, so whatever.
177523	188329	And then, I don't know, just waiting for Elebits this week, and actually I'm going to probably try to pick up Far Cry Vengeance as well, so those will be fun.
189410	194533	And more Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories, and
195836	196817	I don't know, that's pretty much it.
197177	215228	I know, was it on Tuesday, actually, I'm going to be hooking up the Wii in our kind of giant theater at work that we have for a demonstration for all the sales staff, and it's going to be kind of cool because we get to use my wireless sensor bar that I made, so I'm going to be playing the Wii on a giant screen.
215248	220291	I actually tried it out on Friday, and it worked out pretty good, so I'm looking forward to that.
220711	224974	But in the meantime, just kind of kicking back and waiting for some better games to come out, and
225580	226160	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
256136	258778	What was the reason that you decided to go to RPM today?
258838	259018	What?
279287	281453	What made him decide to do RPM of all places?
281774	282936	He likes race cars.
283297	285803	He likes to drag cars and everything.
285884	288911	So we thought it'd be fun to go down there because I've never been down there.
289246	290026	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
316608	323591	The second car I got really sucked, and the tires were all fucked up on it, so it wouldn't grip it, and I kept spinning out and hitting the wall.
324052	325612	And, I don't know, it was fun, though.
325772	328314	Can you imagine what Loki must be like at one of these places?
331835	333336	Yes, that's right, the music's starting.
333356	336517	And it's like, oh, it's like initial D!
338058	339379	Ready, set, go!
342836	344676	No, we should totally get out of here, though.
344696	347457	Everything I need to know here I learned from Initial D!
348697	349358	Mega Drift!
352338	355679	Damn, I left my little stupid Sega card at home.
355799	356399	What am I going to do?
356599	357340	It was fun, though.
357540	359420	I mean, really, we should go do it.
360160	360820	Like, the show.
360900	362401	I think it would be fun.
362461	365021	I think that's something we should put on YouTube.
366282	367762	We could, too, because you could film it.
367782	368642	Only if we get loaded.
368962	369803	Before we go.
370503	370903	God.
372402	373363	Don't drink and drive, kids.
373383	374963	We're only kidding.
375084	376124	I thought I'd mention that, though.
377065	381327	I played a bit of Motorstorm at a kiosk at Best Buy, and I like it.
381407	387090	I think it's kind of cool, but it's a lot slower, though, than Excite Truck.
387150	391992	To be honest, I really wish that EA would do a Burnout off-road series.
392152	393633	You know what Motorstorm did for me?
397795	398976	Oh, this game sucks!
400036	400777	That was Motorstorm.
402793	403073	That's it.
403273	404134	When I played it at Target.
404774	405675	Hi Miklatov!
405695	407256	You decided to join us after all.
407456	409377	Yeah, we just got back from the bowling alley.
409437	410057	How's my mic?
410197	411278	I think you're okay.
411378	412439	I might have to turn you up a little bit.
412459	413259	But how are you doing?
413479	414700	I'm tired now.
414820	416661	So you guys want to go play the new DDR without me?
417022	417302	Yeah.
417602	418903	Well, not the new new DDR.
418923	419883	The newest DDR.
419923	421304	The newest DDR to us in Sacramento.
421324	422145	How was it?
422465	425687	I didn't realize how stupid I am when I make steps sometimes.
426240	427741	Oh, that's right, because you do steps for the game.
427941	434746	Yeah, and we had to redo some steps a while ago for the Ultramix One songs.
434986	438729	Like, I played Gorgeous 2012 on doubles, and I played Heavy.
439129	441511	I don't know if many people realize, but it has new Heavy steps.
442371	444393	And so I was playing, and I was like, oh, yeah, I remember making these.
444413	445013	These are fun.
445493	446914	And then it got to utter crap.
446974	448796	I was like, what was I thinking?
449036	450457	And then I just gave up and died.
453159	454440	Was there a large crowd there playing DDR?
454460	454500	No.
456233	460254	If me and Irene are a large crowd, then yeah, there was a very large crowd.
461454	462374	I'm trying to fix your mic here.
462394	464175	How else was your gaming week?
464855	468755	I played more Elite Beat Agents, trying to S everything on Hard Rock.
468915	470016	Wow, I can hear myself.
470656	471476	You're supposed to be able to.
471716	472256	Oh, okay.
472276	475017	Yeah, I played Elite Beat Agents.
476477	481958	I started playing Zelda again, and the fourth dungeon boss is the best boss fight I've ever played in my life.
482118	482778	It was so cool.
484312	489535	And, um, I don't think I did anything else besides that.
490496	491977	So it's just been Zelda all week long?
492137	493718	No, because I don't play video games anymore.
493738	497280	When have you been playing PSP and DS and all that stuff?
497340	498060	PSP?
498120	499061	When did I say I played PSP?
499081	500242	Or DS, I'm fine, DS.
500462	501542	Elite Beat Agents?
502083	502543	That's it?
502803	503223	Yes.
504304	504484	Alright.
504504	506945	It's my favorite game that I have on DS.
507045	507846	It's a good game.
507906	509147	It's called Elite Beat Agents.
509467	509607	Alright.
511222	513464	Say hello as well to someone else who's here.
513484	514865	Say hello to Rice Princess.
514925	516066	God, we haven't seen you in forever.
516346	517007	Yeah, it's been a while.
517527	518268	How was your gaming week?
518288	518929	What have you been playing?
519889	520450	Nothing.
520930	522231	Can you take a guess?
522251	523633	You've got to get real close to the mic.
523653	524694	These mics are not very sensitive.
524714	525354	So what have you been playing?
525554	526655	Can you take a guess?
527016	527416	I can.
528017	528637	What is it, Shane?
528657	530098	It rhymes with kawau.
530118	532160	You'd be right.
532280	534983	It rhymes with World of Boarcraft.
535643	536804	Yeah, shut up.
541874	543835	Are you saying I'm the world of boar crap?
544336	545997	Yes, Rob, you are a world of boar crap.
546037	546297	All right.
546517	549819	Well, what server are you on?
549859	551260	What character class are you?
551680	553822	What are you doing in the WoW or the Wob?
555143	556383	The Wob?
557044	559785	I'm on Elder Thalyss and I PvP.
561106	561667	All day long?
562547	563588	All day long.
563608	563908	All right.
564068	566070	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
566850	567170	All right.
567310	567731	Yep.
567951	569272	Well, have fun with your Wob.
569852	570652	I'll do that.
570953	571273	All right.
572507	575868	Uh, My Gaming Week, um, not a whole lot of new stuff.
575908	580850	I decided to go back and rediscover, um, GameTap, because I haven't been playing it a lot lately.
581430	588413	And so I decided to load that up, and they actually have some cool new stuff on there, because they have, like, the Castlevania games and Contra games from the old school, like, 8-bit NES are on there.
589079	593283	and Silent Hill 2 is on GameTap, which it looks very nice.
593463	593923	I was very surprised.
593943	599548	It looks better than it does on PS2 because, you know, it uses the advanced hardware on the computer to give the smoother textures and things.
599828	601250	I was very, very pleased with that.
601290	603191	And you can really control the resolution and everything.
603211	603912	So that was really cool.
604352	605273	And Civilization 3.
606094	609417	And for those who have listened to the show in the past, you guys know I love Civilization.
609477	611358	It's my favorite PC game of all time.
611799	615562	Yet Civilization 2 was such a shock to me that I just...
616192	616793	Thank you for watching!
636522	637003	I'm not liking it.
637063	638164	I'm going to go play it some more.
638364	638865	Good times.
639005	645693	Maybe I'll have to play some OLR listeners because it's multi... Although I don't even know anyone else with GameTap besides our webmaster, VxJasonXV.
645973	647735	I'm still waiting for Myst Online to come out on there.
647795	649557	I have not played the Sam & Max game yet, though.
649718	650799	I will at some point.
650959	651480	Definitely play that.
652461	656486	Otherwise, I decided based on a new forum we have in our...
657470	659571	Orange Launch Radio Forums, PC Gaming Forum
680462	681443	and it's actually pretty fun.
682303	687426	It was a lot of fun, so much so that I decided to spend the 20 bucks and get every X10 extra on the PSP.
687766	690607	So I'll know more about that game next week when I've actually played it some more.
690808	691748	You found it today?
692048	693409	Yes, it was actually easy to find.
693469	694790	GameStop has it cut down to 20 bucks.
695270	697891	Ooh, too bad GameStop is evil, but wow.
698091	702554	Well, you know, I'll get it wherever I can get it because I use their online search the store to shut up.
705095	707096	Also, I got a present.
707236	708577	Loki got me a Christmas present.
708597	710498	I got Final Fantasy 3 on the DS.
710518	711099	No, you may not.
711259	712079	Please.
712119	713460	I'm going to punch you in the face.
714360	715201	Then I will play it.
715401	717462	Only I get to divergenize my cartridge.
718122	718983	Ew.
719023	719703	You know that feeling?
719743	726847	Like when you buy a new game, you don't want someone else to crap up your game with their save file, right?
727128	731810	It's like you want to be the first one to turn it on, see the opening cinema, all that stuff.
731830	733111	You don't want someone else to skank it up.
734224	738325	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
766139	767059	I'm so excited.
767079	767879	I can't wait.
767939	768639	I need bread.
769160	769820	I need bread.
769840	771600	That'll be my Christmas present.
772000	772300	What?
772820	774220	That'll be my Christmas present.
775181	776021	Awesome.
776321	776841	You got it?
777061	778881	Did you make a high-pitched squealing noise?
778961	779361	I did.
779381	781242	Because I thought I heard you from the bathroom.
784382	787643	Hopefully that was me and not something, you know, some bathroom noise.
789003	789223	What?
789703	790043	Oh, nothing.
791423	793084	I guess that's it for my gaming week.
793364	794684	I don't really have anything else to share.
795828	797209	DarkSakura.com
818513	819113	RedRum6622 RedRum6622
848328	849068	Red Rum.
849789	850449	Red Rum.
852970	853550	I love The Shining.
854191	860994	Claims he's filed a class action lawsuit against Microsoft because of some problems he had after their recent fall system update.
861494	863615	This was posted on the official Xbox forum.
863675	869358	So, you know, you can kind of take this with a grain of salt because it's an official Xbox forum post and those can be a little crazy.
870599	876843	He basically said, he filed this class action lawsuit, plaintiff versus Microsoft Corporation, a Washington corporation, blah, blah, blah.
877123	879665	And then there's summary of claims, blah, blah, blah, legal mumbo jumbo.
879825	888131	One, this is a class action against Microsoft and its affiliates for breach of contract, violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act, and alternatively, negligence.
888431	899275	Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and all other persons who experienced hardware problems with their Microsoft 360 gaming consoles following installation of Microsoft's Fall 2006 update for the Xbox 360.
900396	900956	The parties.
901116	904378	Plaintiff, name blocked, is an individual resident of California.
904698	908639	Plaintiff is the original purchaser and current owner of an Xbox 360 gaming console.
908979	915082	Plaintiff brings this action individually and as a class action under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of the...
915595	919221	Class specified herein, blah, blah, blah, ipso facto, etc., etc.
919241	920803	What do you think, Loki?
921664	925290	But he's saying that it's in violation of Washington law, yeah, he's a California resident.
926417	928478	I... Supposedly, that's what it is, yeah.
928558	937320	Okay, and the other fact that the fall update only affected... The glitch in the fall update, I guess, only affected less than 1% of the 360s out there.
937400	938820	You have to admit, that's still a lot, though.
938880	939801	Okay, that's true.
940281	946722	To which, any of them that were affected by that were immediately fixed and replaced, you know, if you called the 1-800 number.
947042	949223	So it's not like they're saying, fuck you, you're just out of 360.
949263	952524	They're doing, you know, their part to fix it, so...
952904	956268	This is just some dumbass Californian who's trying to get more money from them.
956648	959391	Boo fucking hoo, your damn 360 broke.
959511	961954	Send it in like everybody else and just get a new one.
962575	964637	God, is it really that big a deal?
965378	970664	ShadowNextGen in our chatroom, which by the way, hi chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join.
970924	973247	ShadowNextGen said, dude just wants attention.
973817	974397	Is that what's going on?
974577	975498	He does want attention.
975918	978539	Well, now you have his gamer tag, so fucking send him hate mail.
978559	979020	There you go.
979520	987624	OL Army Alex says, I can't prove my 360 having died, though my useless posts in the forums and having called MS Support twice count.
988464	991886	In other words, how are you going to prove that your 360 was bricked?
993327	994087	I don't know.
994187	995708	I guess that's an interesting idea.
996729	997169	Let's see.
998269	999410	There was another comment here.
999470	1001271	Oh, Jumpman said, My 360 died.
1001331	1003532	Microsoft gave me a new one and all is right with the world.
1003857	1004017	See?
1004558	1006459	Is it that hard?
1006579	1009821	I mean, they're aware of the problem, and they were fixing them.
1009981	1011662	So, what more do you want them to do?
1011822	1013383	Fucking give you a blowjob or something?
1013403	1014204	I mean, seriously.
1014584	1018087	Just... This guy... You're a little bit feisty tonight.
1018107	1019928	He needs to... Go ahead with your class action lawsuit.
1019948	1021349	Who ruffled your feathers before the show tonight?
1021369	1021549	No, no, no.
1021589	1022990	Go ahead with your class action lawsuit.
1023010	1024871	Just because you have a lawsuit doesn't mean you're gonna win.
1024911	1029054	I hope you waste all the money in the world, and I hope your 360 doesn't work afterwards.
1029174	1030255	So, fuck you.
1030976	1034080	Macman in our chat says, It's about time someone sued Microsoft.
1034440	1035501	Rise, my iMac.
1035822	1037484	Rise from your grave.
1038465	1038725	Get it?
1038906	1039666	Altered Beast reference.
1039807	1040047	Get it?
1040948	1042169	Altered Beast.
1042230	1043050	That's a good game.
1043151	1043371	I know.
1043451	1043871	Altered Beast.
1043952	1045433	I said I won't buy it on Virtual Console.
1045453	1046134	Not for eight bucks.
1046855	1048076	Not when it's not the arcade version.
1050330	1054411	Anyways, so more craziness, 360 related, of course, this week.
1055391	1074394	On Monday, during Monday Night Football, the first kind of teaser trailer for Halo 3 was aired on TV, and of course, everybody and their brother basically took this and decided, hey, you know what, it'd be fun, let's change the music on it, just like we did with the Mad World ad for Gears of War.
1076234	1078315	You know, I thought it was a pretty cool trailer.
1078675	1079435	I mean, I like it.
1079615	1079655	It
1080174	1082896	It's just like, it has the same impact as the first one, I think.
1083217	1084578	The first teaser during E3.
1086259	1087660	I'm really psyched for the game.
1087700	1095326	Hopefully we'll hear something from the beta, you know, despite the fact that there's probably going to be, you know, you know, tight lip.
1096087	1097628	I swear I could not sign up for the beta.
1097908	1099950	I tried like 50 times and I couldn't get in on it.
1099990	1100671	Stupid site.
1101191	1105455	It was funny because they had the link up for the beta before the beta thing even launched, so I signed up then.
1105635	1108197	Yeah, so did I. I didn't have to worry about the page.
1108217	1109518	Well, la-di-da to you both.
1110242	1115525	But some of us have to actually work at work and can't refresh constantly on the site.
1115665	1117226	I didn't hit refresh constantly.
1117266	1120268	I read it in a blog and then I went and signed up.
1121328	1124650	I also signed up for Shadowrun, so hopefully I get in on one of those.
1125311	1134076	Because, to be honest, the last one I played was Test Drive Unlimited and, you know, just the PlayStation 2 version is not as good as the 360 one.
1134376	1136957	But, yeah, Halo 3 looks cool.
1137498	1137818	I mean...
1138399	1142061	We know it's going to be pretty good, so... Just have to wait!
1142642	1144203	Until they tease us with more shit.
1144943	1147945	Of course, many folks in our chatroom are talking about how they signed up for the beta.
1148005	1153208	JeremyTodd1 says, I signed up for the beta, but still, there's like .9% of actually getting into the beta.
1153288	1154989	Too many Halo fanboys.
1155369	1156930	But, here's the thing, though.
1156970	1159752	There's going to be more ways to get into the beta as the weeks go along.
1160372	1166196	This is straight from my EA rep, because we were like, once we saw that the beta... The fuck does EA know about Halo, though?
1166336	1167277	Not EA, I'm sorry.
1167377	1167697	Microsoft.
1167717	1167997	Microsoft.
1169102	1170603	I wanna play some Pimps at Sea!
1194864	1199665	as that was called when folks were spotting them on Xbox Live this week, testing Halo 3.
1200666	1204647	You really think we're going to have to wait all the way to next Thanksgiving for this game?
1205147	1209428	I mean, jeez, they're advertising it like it's coming out tomorrow, it seems like, with all this hype.
1210128	1211229	I don't think we'll have to wait.
1211389	1222332	And to be honest, I really... They're pretty much, you know, if they're going in the beta, I mean, the game's almost done then.
1222927	1227288	I mean, they wouldn't be going into the beta if it was, you know, being put out in November.
1227368	1229069	I mean, that's a perfect example right there.
1229149	1233390	The beta test is in the spring because it's a beta test.
1233450	1235251	It means the game's right about to come out.
1235431	1245414	So, you know, I think it's definitely going to be hitting the, probably the stores around the end of March, mid-March.
1246314	1247855	There is some interesting stuff, though, because this,
1248896	1254000	Beta sign-up was mainly for the US and North America type stuff.
1254260	1258803	However, if you're in the UK, there's going to be a few ways you can get signed up.
1259304	1265128	And there's actually quite a list of websites, depending on which country you're in, that you can sign up.
1265548	1268030	They have limited slots for the beta available.
1268590	1274774	Such sites, for example, the UK, Rewired Mind, 360 Monster, BritXbox...
1276934	1287537	MSXboxWorld.com, Totally360.com, and then of course Germany's got a bunch of different sites as well, PlanetXbox, etc.
1288637	1290878	So definitely take a look out there.
1290898	1292478	There's tons of links.
1293759	1305782	I know IGN ran a story with some of this stuff, so if you're looking to get signed up and you don't live in the United States, then definitely check these out because they haven't finished their beta signups yet.
1308104	1309205	I suck at Halo.
1309286	1314791	I'm really, really bad at Halo, but I think the game is presented just beautifully.
1315472	1318335	I'm getting suckered into this marketing campaign stuff a little bit.
1318635	1319936	My hype meter is going up a little bit.
1320157	1320837	I'm excited for this.
1320857	1325322	I've played Halo 2 maybe twice in my life.
1326163	1327184	Are you going to get Halo 3?
1327704	1328225	I'll get Halo 3.
1328265	1328405	Sucker.
1330388	1330568	Why?
1330608	1331649	It's a first person shooter.
1331689	1332109	It looks fun.
1332149	1332590	It'll be fun.
1333150	1333890	I'm sure it'll be good.
1333990	1335031	It's a good multiplayer game.
1335191	1336272	It's like Call of Duty 3.
1336312	1339914	I've been playing Call of Duty 3 and that's okay.
1339994	1344637	I mean, it's... There's a few things that... I don't understand why they're making sequels.
1345398	1347819	Why they don't just improve on the original one.
1347839	1349500	They always have to take content out.
1350161	1353142	And it's really obvious stuff that should be in there.
1353162	1355164	Like, I don't know, a radar or something.
1355204	1358686	You know, when the gunfire is going off, you can see where the person is on the map.
1359435	1360756	Flash, where they're at.
1361157	1364159	That was perfect for Call of Duty 2, so you had to be quiet.
1364780	1367922	But now, you can just fire away, and no one knows where the hell you are.
1367942	1370825	I don't know.
1371205	1372346	I haven't really played that series.
1372406	1372847	Couldn't tell you.
1373087	1373507	Couldn't tell you.
1374188	1382315	Well, you know, Loki messed up there and was talking about EA, but maybe it was a bit of a slip, because the next story is about EA, and...
1384509	1390955	EA is famous for putting out things on Marketplace that basically just unlocks things you can get in the game anyway.
1391516	1400725	Well, Need for Speed Carbon has gotten their list on Xbox Live now of some various custom car packages.
1401395	1410740	and aftermarket hoods bundle and spoilers bundle and roof scoops and a 1987 Toyota Corolla that you can now purchase for various amounts of points.
1411240	1414101	And this is just all crap that you can basically unlock in the game if you're patient.
1414121	1415242	At least most of this, I believe.
1416062	1419544	I think some of it, some of the cars, I think, are exclusive to that.
1419844	1426368	Yeah, a couple, I think maybe the 87 Corolla, but most of that other stuff you can get in the game if you're just patient.
1426988	1429229	Exactly, so, yeah, whatever.
1430339	1433661	Well, other news about EA, and this was kind of cool, because I like Burnout.
1433781	1434581	Burnout's awesome.
1435082	1441125	They're doing a special Burnout game for the PS2 and PlayStation Portable, Burnout Dominator.
1441625	1448308	And from what I've gathered from the press release so far, is it's going to be similar to the Burnout Legends game on the PSP.
1448688	1457313	Kind of a culmination of the entire series so far, featuring all the tracks from 1 all the way through 3, and probably also...
1458766	1461088	Burnout 4 or Revenge.
1463149	1463670	Looks cool.
1463890	1466772	Kind of a good way to end the series on the PlayStation 2.
1467973	1469554	Maybe there might be another PSP version.
1469955	1470996	Assuming this one does okay.
1471576	1476740	But Burnout 5 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and the 360s.
1476820	1478762	So that will be kind of fun to look forward to.
1479022	1480863	Hopefully they have one for the Wii because that would be kind of cool too.
1482224	1483025	Burnout on the Wii?
1483085	1483545	I don't know.
1484226	1485387	They have Excite Truck on the Wii.
1485547	1485987	I guess.
1486047	1486307	I don't know.
1486327	1486848	It would be a little weird.
1486868	1487108	I don't know.
1487606	1492689	I actually, one game, I don't think I mentioned this during my game of the week, but I have been playing Burnout on the 360 quite a bit this week.
1492749	1498512	For no particular reason, I just wanted to play more Burnout and have custom soundtracks and all that fun stuff.
1498952	1502454	And I also really suck at Burnout, so I don't just suck at Halo, I suck at Burnout too.
1504595	1505155	Good times.
1506035	1509237	I will definitely check out the next Burnout on 360 though.
1509917	1510998	It'll be fun.
1511923	1512183	WEEE60 Magazine
1531683	1558060	it's being called an underground movement birthed by the most noble of players during the E3 2006 conference they're calling it the unadulterated voice of truth in this generation of gaming these men of valor are some of the most important people in the video game industry and their voice must be heard not just from coast to coast but from pole to pole what the who writes this crap what probably the same people that are going to be you know writing this magazine and to be honest it's probably going to suck
1559451	1560872	These people really love themselves.
1561212	1570860	Well, anyway, you can check out www.we60.com to get more information on the magazine if you are curious about this and want to check it out.
1571581	1578666	Now, what's interesting is that there is a we60.com, but the link here leads to we60.tv, so I'm not sure what that's all about.
1578706	1579547	Maybe there's two sites.
1581235	1582956	Maybe you should type it in and look.
1583136	1583996	I'm looking, I'm looking.
1584096	1588217	No, it looks like we60.tv looks like the real site.
1588277	1588817	Oh, get this.
1589278	1600681	The publisher's name is Martin Loki Alessi and his email address is loki at we60.tv Here's another magazine that'll be stealing from you, Loki.
1601581	1602422	God damn it.
1603102	1603762	I hate people.
1605043	1609644	Blaze in our chatroom says, Hi, I write for the magazine We60 and I fucking rule, heart.
1610834	1613315	James Patrick calls this the hate on Sony magazine.
1613355	1617556	Those comments from me come from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1618796	1623657	Anyways, speaking of the Wii, Sony and Microsoft may have a Wii dilemma.
1623677	1626978	I get it.
1628078	1636180	If, you know, basically this, what Jack Aldrich from Motley Fool, if what he says is correct,
1636653	1639034	Basically, it makes sense.
1639074	1640695	This is kind of what they were targeting towards.
1641335	1664166	Since the Wii is kind of aiming at that casual gamer, non-gamer, people that haven't picked up a video game system yet market, they may be able to actually grow the games market and basically, instead of just trying to target the same people that have, say, a PlayStation 2 or Xbox or GameCube, they can actually get a bunch of new gamers and
1664921	1666222	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1691889	1692209	I don't know.
1692329	1693590	I think it's interesting.
1693690	1694330	It makes sense.
1694910	1708275	Aldrich is basically quoted as saying, Unfortunately, because most of the time and energy for the past year has been focused on providing more horsepower and fancier graphics for existing customers, the hardcore gamers demand the upgrades found in the PlayStation 3.
1708695	1713017	Sony has not busied themselves in developing products that appeal to non-gamers.
1713617	1721160	As a result, it appears that they are now behind the curve in development of simpler to use and less expensive technologies like the Wii.
1722199	1722699	And it makes sense.
1722739	1728982	I mean, the PlayStation 3 is... That's a lot of money to drop on a system that you might not be sure about.
1729302	1733364	And whereas the Wii, I think, it's pretty much pick up and go type thing.
1733404	1736986	Especially since it comes with its own game already.
1738266	1738547	Hmm.
1738807	1739247	Interesting.
1739587	1742428	I mean, so you kind of agree with what's going on here with this story?
1742668	1743189	I think so.
1743269	1744930	But then again, the 360, I think...
1747194	1751917	With Sony, though, I don't rule out that they're not going to try to copy more stuff that the Wii is doing.
1752177	1757641	I mean, I think there is already some patents registered for more devices like the Wiimote.
1758301	1763024	I wouldn't be surprised if they try to copy everything that the Wii is doing.
1763404	1765686	Even if they did copy it, though, do you think it would work?
1766406	1772770	I don't think so, because even still, so you have some games that appeal to a casual gamer.
1772890	1775031	Well, a casual gamer is not going to drop $600 for your system.
1777458	1777918	That's true.
1778339	1792631	Also, I kind of think about, you know, I don't know, I think about the Wii and I think about all those real big brand names that Nintendo has and big franchises like Metroid and Smash Brothers and Mario and Zelda and, you know, you get my point.
1792981	1794442	Sony, Nintendo, Mario, Zelda, Metroid, Halo, Nintendo
1816738	1817599	Halo 4, Final Fantasy XIII
1844551	1847553	Well, let me put it this way.
1847653	1867569	If Final Fantasy XIII for the PlayStation 3, if it ends up that the Xbox 360 has sold tens of millions more systems than, say, the PlayStation 3 at the time the game's coming out, I will bet you anything that they will be putting it out on the Xbox 360 as well as the PlayStation 3, if not only on the Xbox 360.
1869048	1875743	FootyMonster in our chatroom responded to something I said earlier, saying Sky, but on the other hand, Nintendo has no third party so far.
1875944	1876285	Well...
1877082	1877822	Yes and no.
1878043	1888769	I mean, the third party, they don't have any really huge third party franchises the way that maybe some of the other consoles do, but third parties do seem to be sort of rallying around the Wii a little bit.
1888869	1891951	I mean, they want to put out some of their franchises on there.
1892031	1894372	And it has gotten support, at least at their launch.
1894432	1898094	I mean, Red Steel was a big title, even though it was a critical hit and miss.
1898634	1901436	Trauma Center was a great game, even though it wasn't
1901716	1902617	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1929855	1942225	But, I mean, at some point they're going to have to understand, okay, this system, you know, let's say a year from now when Final Fantasy XIII is coming out, say that they're not able to sell as many systems as they would have liked for the PlayStation 3.
1942645	1945127	So they're behind by, say, 10 million systems.
1946616	1959859	Why would I develop for a system that has less units out there, less of a chance for me to make my money back when there's a system that's cheaper to develop for and has a lot more systems out there and is capable of doing comparable graphics?
1961319	1966480	I don't understand why that would be pure idiocy to just develop for the one system.
1966520	1975542	That's why you have companies like, you know, Koei developing Fatal Inertia and their Bladestorm game for both systems now because...
1976447	1980308	To be honest, they're not going to make their money back if they just put it out on the PlayStation 3.
1981088	1982768	And that's a big problem for Sony.
1982868	1985949	They need to figure out how to get these systems sold.
1986049	1990570	First off, get enough systems out there and give people a reason to buy this system.
1990590	1993210	Because right now it's just saying it has a Blu-ray player.
1993330	1994091	Well, you know what?
1994171	1996631	A lot of people say, who gives a shit about a Blu-ray player?
1996691	2000872	I don't care right now because I'm not going to go replace my entire DVD library.
2002483	2003103	Interesting thoughts.
2003183	2005684	If you agree or disagree, send us an email.
2005704	2007484	Because we'll get to the emails a little later in the program.
2007524	2012445	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Meanwhile, we've got to keep going through the news.
2012786	2018387	And speaking of Nintendo Wii, very interesting... I don't know if this would be news or rumor.
2018427	2020787	The thing is that it's coming from a foreign website.
2020827	2029690	And not to discount what foreign websites might be saying, but we kind of get a little bit... Until we see a press release from Nintendo of America, we're not really sure what to think of this.
2030010	2031170	But according to this website...
2031550	2033451	and Siamite.de.
2034071	2037453	They were reporting that you're going to be able to download Wii game demos.
2037733	2042835	You can either store the demos in your flash RAM on the console or to an external SD card.
2043355	2048718	Now, what's kind of interesting about this is that, well, the Wii doesn't have exactly that much internal memory.
2048758	2050078	I mean, it's got, what, about 512 megs?
2050098	2050318	Yep.
2051099	2060103	And by the time you start downloading all this other stuff that Nintendo's planning to put out, like the internet channel, you know, things of that nature, that stuff's going to start to fill up, especially with some of the other big virtual console releases.
2060143	2060263	So...
2061933	2063194	Where are these demos going to go?
2063274	2067418	I guess there's the SD card, but still, it seems a little... Not quite.
2067438	2067838	I don't know.
2068379	2080110	Well, one thing to keep reading, and they're saying that there's support for USB hard drives and USB devices coming, but you have to have the latest update to be able to store stuff to it.
2080630	2085195	The only thing is, though, is this update I think people are talking about isn't out yet.
2085555	2087437	And from what the rumors I've been reading are,
2088027	2093309	That update with the internet channel is going to support USB hard drives as well.
2093369	2095190	If that's the case, then they can store them to that.
2095650	2100992	And I'm sure you'll see a Nintendo hard drive of some sort that'll plug in via the USB ports on there.
2102493	2105034	I don't know, it sounds like a little after the fact.
2105094	2109536	I mean, I really wish they would have put more storage in the system, but
2110677	2111677	That's a little bit disappointing.
2111737	2117299	I would have thought they would have put more storage inside the actual system itself, but I mean, I guess, you know, they want to keep it cheap, so it makes sense.
2117319	2118179	Okay, that's fine.
2118219	2119460	If you want to keep it cheap, fine.
2119920	2122440	Build a port for a hard drive, then.
2122520	2124481	Well, it's not what the SD card slot's for, really.
2124881	2127462	Because you can fit quite a bit on those little cards.
2128971	2132573	and they were good enough that you can put any SD card in there.
2132633	2136734	In fact, most people are saying, screw these official Nintendo SD cards.
2136774	2140175	I'm going to go buy the cheaper ones and use those.
2140596	2143357	I've been using the card for my camera phone to send pictures.
2143877	2149159	In fact, I was digging through my phone the other day and I saw a picture of you at E3 Outpost.
2149679	2152500	It's really funny because you're leaning over the couch and going, rawr!
2152860	2156462	But you can see Bobby Blackwolf in the background doing some busy work.
2156502	2157642	So I send it to Bobby and I
2158243	2160304	Drew like a big arrow in the paint channel.
2160344	2161184	I put, who dat?
2161284	2162085	Or something like that.
2164406	2167387	So I've been having fun with the camera phone converter thing.
2167967	2168408	SD card.
2168888	2171409	And I put Zelda on it, just for fun.
2171429	2172990	Even though I know I can't play it on other Wii's.
2173070	2173530	Just for fun.
2173550	2175471	So I can say, I got Zelda in my pocket.
2177612	2178632	Because I'm lame like that.
2179193	2183575	Anyways, so there is another story that came out very vague this week.
2183795	2186516	It was coming from a magazine called Games TM.
2187405	2189986	Um, and... But wait, I gotta say that this is a very good point.
2190146	2193327	James Patrick is saying 360 has no hard drive in its core bundle.
2194347	2194587	True.
2195867	2196267	That's a good point.
2196287	2197368	But they had a port for one, though.
2198508	2199288	True, okay.
2199628	2200068	You got that.
2200428	2204309	And it does have some internal memory, but not that you can save games on, really.
2204990	2207610	It's just for, you know, updates and things like that.
2208551	2208871	Yeah.
2209651	2210051	Um, anyways.
2210849	2214313	Um, so yeah, there is a very vague comment from the magazine.
2214373	2217516	It says, something big coming to Wii Virtual Console.
2218517	2221300	And, uh... How big is it?
2221640	2223502	Well, it doesn't say.
2223762	2225143	What the hell am I reporting as this news?
2225204	2226985	I know, what the fuck kind of news is this?
2227005	2228527	There's something coming!
2228567	2231129	Something big is on its way!
2234112	2234433	Well...
2236276	2243438	Reggie Fils-Aim√© is about to make a big duty that you can download on your virtual console this Monday.
2243458	2245838	Listen, I want my fucking Nintendo games.
2246198	2250399	TurboGrafx-16's great and all, but give me more Nintendo games.
2251099	2251939	You know, what the hell?
2252880	2253880	Where's my Kid Icarus?
2255000	2256360	Where's my Guardian Legend?
2257341	2260381	Where's my Super Castlevania IV, which they have overseas?
2260861	2263862	Where's my Link to the Past, which they have overseas?
2265083	2266124	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2283075	2286056	Alien Crush, which was a pretty badass TurboGrafx-16 game
2306004	2308105	Supposed to be every Monday.
2308325	2311586	Yeah, but do we have to be getting TurboGrafx and Genesis every Monday?
2311606	2317368	I mean, don't get me wrong, there's some good games there, but there's things I want more on the NES.
2317728	2320909	Somebody in chat was saying Gunstar Heroes is rumored for this Monday.
2321789	2328511	I imagine the four games we're going to get probably are just going to be games that are available elsewhere, but who knows which ones.
2328531	2333293	So I tried using my credit card to put more points on my virtual console account, and it didn't work.
2333720	2336481	Shadow Charlie is okay with more Genesis as long as it's Streets of Rage.
2362984	2364845	and Shadow Next Gen agrees with me.
2364865	2366166	Link to the Past on Virtual Console.
2367167	2369348	Shadow Next Gen also wants Super Metroid on VC.
2369408	2369789	Hell yeah.
2369829	2371150	Dark Knight wants Pilotwings.
2371810	2373011	Those are all good stuff.
2373151	2376853	Proper T wants Super C. That was a pretty cool game.
2377794	2379095	Super C, I think, is on GameTap.
2379355	2380476	I think as well, with the Contra.
2380836	2382057	So, you can always check it out there.
2382577	2384478	I want the Super Nintendo Contra, though.
2384639	2385819	That wasn't called Super C, was it?
2385839	2386320	It was something else.
2386340	2387240	Super Contra, right?
2387540	2388061	I want that one.
2388461	2390342	That was pretty cool, because it had, like, the Mode 7 levels.
2390362	2390903	Those are rad.
2391363	2391703	Yeah.
2392324	2392684	Anyways.
2393200	2408386	So much like Immersion did with the Sony PlayStation 2 DualShock controller, another company has claimed that they want to take Nintendo the court over the Wii Remote because they say they have a patent for it.
2409186	2419570	And a very similar kind of lawsuit, a company called Interlink, who has revealed that they have a device that's very similar to the Wii Remote that they've patented.
2420057	2423919	I guess they probably haven't created said device, but they have a patent for it anyways.
2424759	2428421	And basically, going to try to get some money out of Nintendo.
2430162	2432543	Different company, same song, it sounds like.
2434964	2448350	God, I hate when these companies do this stuff, because they totally create patents for stuff that they don't imagine that they're not going to even use, just because they probably hear that some company is making something similar.
2449187	2451689	Well, what if this did legitimately already exist?
2452790	2453811	Well, it looks like crap anyways.
2453831	2459094	To be honest, looking at this right now, it looks like a TV remote.
2460295	2461116	That's all it looks like.
2461136	2468061	It looks like it has an infrared emitter inside the actual device.
2468081	2470183	You know, controller, I guess.
2470303	2475287	And then there's a receiver that would be an infrared receiver.
2475307	2475347	So...
2476690	2485433	If anything, I would say that the people that created a TV remote would be able to sue over the Wii remote.
2486033	2490575	I think there's enough different with the two devices that they probably won't win.
2490595	2500898	Well, now, it says here that, I'm reading through the complaint here, and this patent was filed by the other company on February 1st, 2005, long before anyone knew anything about the Wii, so...
2501621	2502441	True, though.
2502661	2505963	Okay, so it was filed 2005.
2506363	2513185	Doesn't mean, though, that they weren't... I'd want to see when the patent was filed for the Wii remote.
2513786	2516787	Because apparently the Wii has been in production for a long time.
2519068	2519468	I don't know.
2520848	2521269	Oh, I see.
2522089	2524250	You use it in operating the computer from far away.
2524290	2526411	They made it for the computer.
2526451	2527151	It's probably to...
2528843	2533525	It's like one of those things that will let you run the PowerPoint shows from afar.
2533585	2534546	I have one at work.
2534706	2537727	That's just a TV remote, though, basically.
2538408	2540028	I mean, that's basically what it is.
2540929	2541309	Interesting.
2542670	2544851	I mean, isn't that what a TV remote is?
2545311	2548212	Or a DVD remote, for example.
2548232	2556336	That would be basically what it is, because I use the PlayStation 2 DVD remote to navigate menus and stuff.
2556836	2558077	It's very similar to this.
2558539	2559920	It uses IR as well.
2562102	2563483	I just think that they're too different.
2563523	2568728	I mean, this is very similar to, say, a TV remote than it is, you know, the Wii remote.
2569248	2572851	Raven's Dolphin says the Wii trigger goes through Bluetooth, not infrared.
2572871	2573372	They will lose.
2574332	2574853	Exactly.
2576274	2576454	Hmm.
2577495	2586723	Well, you know, these lawsuits that seemingly come out of nowhere when something gets popular, they make us angsty, and we get really angry about this stuff because we don't want anyone taking away our Wii.
2587256	2589878	So that means it's about time for the FUs of the week.
2598745	2602148	Since DarkSakura is not here tonight, Loki, you're going to have to start us off.
2603469	2605190	FU to DarkSakura for not being here.
2606672	2607432	FU to the ferret.
2611255	2614598	I want to say FU to RPM Racing because they're...
2615154	2624316	Number 11 car had fucked up traction on it, so it kept slamming into the wall and I actually had to get pitted one lap because they black flagged me.
2627677	2632378	Fuck you to Rob for the fact that he keeps playing initial D music.
2634099	2635819	This is pretty good FU music, I like this.
2637320	2642141	Let's see, I would have to say... Gosh, I don't have a lot to be angsty about today.
2642923	2667238	I would say an FU to the rain and it being so cold out recently an FU to the fact that I'm spoiled by California weather so what's cold right now probably isn't really cold to other people so FU to the weather lately because it's been kind of crappy that's it, Miklatov left the room because he has a bad headache I guess DDR gave him a headache so Miklatov's not here to put in his FU so FU to headaches and Advil it doesn't work
2669662	2678727	Anyhow, let's go into our next story, which is about the Spike TV VGAs, if I'm not mistaking.
2680308	2682330	Did you... Oh, these haven't aired yet, have they?
2684091	2685151	I think they're going to air.
2685171	2690514	It taped on Friday, but it's going to air on, what, the 13th?
2691455	2691975	Probably.
2692355	2692596	Well...
2694683	2695604	Spoiler alert!
2696304	2697284	Yeah, spoiler alert.
2697304	2698665	We're going to ruin it for you right now.
2698705	2700626	Here's who won at the Spike TV.
2700726	2703587	Game of the Year was Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.
2704607	2707148	Best Individual Sports Game was Tony Hawk Project 8.
2707969	2710810	Best Team Sports Game was NBA 2K7.
2711290	2715152	Best Song was Lights and Sounds by Yellowcard and Burnout Revenge.
2715272	2716352	Boo!
2716392	2716852	Why boo?
2717633	2718753	Yellowcard sucks.
2718933	2722234	To be honest, I like Today by Junkie XL way better.
2722495	2723475	Alright, let's see.
2723976	2726258	Best Soundtrack was Guitar Hero 2.
2726739	2728560	Studio of the Year was Epic Games.
2728720	2731523	And then they give out a bunch of awards to actors and actresses.
2731663	2736187	Like they gave Best Supporting Male to James Gandolfini in The Sopranos.
2736528	2738550	Best Supporting Female, Rachel Lee Cook.
2738850	2739390	Kingdom Hearts 2.
2740236	2746338	Gamer's Choice for Breakthrough Performance, Rosario Dawson, and an award to Johnny Depp, just because he's Johnny Depp, I guess.
2746678	2749179	Gamer's Choice is the guys that they gave to him.
2749199	2751219	They just wanted Johnny Depp to show up at the award show.
2751259	2751919	You know this is true.
2752099	2752480	Bastard.
2752600	2759982	Anyway, we actually have someone on the line with us who actually attended the event and is going to tell us a little bit more about what happened on the inside.
2760302	2764283	It's Orange Lounge Radio's very own DJ Tyrant from STFU.
2764483	2765663	You there, DJ Tyrant?
2765743	2766804	Yeah, how's it going, guys?
2766924	2767784	Good, how are you doing?
2768739	2769339	I'm doing good.
2769399	2772180	My voice is a little shot from yelling at the awards.
2773101	2773961	What happened?
2774001	2777282	Tell us about how you got into the VGAs and how it all went down.
2778722	2782864	I got an email from X-Fire and they had a thousand tickets to give out.
2782984	2785925	So I just showed up and they gave them to me.
2787445	2787805	Right on.
2787865	2788165	Wow.
2788225	2791166	So you just went right in and got to see all this stuff?
2791186	2792707	Were there a lot of celebrities there?
2793502	2795463	Yeah, there were just a ton of celebrities.
2795543	2799424	I got to meet the guys who do Mega64.com.
2799484	2800184	It was really cool.
2800764	2805606	You know, I met them at an E3 a couple years ago, and they seemed really offended I didn't know who they were.
2806466	2810948	I mean, I know who they are now, but at the time they seemed really offended that I didn't know who they were.
2810988	2811848	I'm like, sorry.
2812748	2814169	But somebody explained it to me afterwards.
2814209	2815729	I'm like, oh, that Tetris video.
2815749	2816749	Yeah, that's kind of funny.
2817250	2818750	So anyway, were they cool to you?
2820330	2821491	They seemed pretty cool, yeah.
2821611	2821851	They were...
2822762	2824142	They were pretty nice to me.
2824402	2826423	How about any A-list celebrities?
2826443	2831644	Because Mega64, with all due respect, is kind of like D, E-list, internet.
2831905	2833005	Where do internet celebrities go?
2833045	2833945	On the E-list somewhere?
2836126	2839267	Did you meet Samuel L. Jackson or Tom Cruise?
2839287	2842047	I didn't get to meet any of the A-list celebrities.
2843328	2844088	I'm sorry to hear that.
2844128	2845628	So why is your voice so hoarse?
2845688	2847849	Were you screaming and yelling and cheering at all these people?
2848869	2852932	Yes, I was more booing at them than anything.
2853572	2856714	So you were booing all the celebrities as they came out on stage?
2857775	2863159	Yeah, as RavensDolphin1 says in chat, I did boo 50 Cent when he came to present an award.
2863219	2864440	What did you say to 50 Cent?
2865801	2867142	I said, your game sucks.
2867922	2868883	Well, I mean, it does.
2870904	2876248	Did anybody yell back, or could people actually hear you, or was it the place so huge they couldn't really hear you?
2877679	2881940	I think some people in the first floor heard me and they laughed.
2883120	2885040	So you were the heckler guy, huh?
2886241	2886961	Yes, I was.
2887101	2892382	I'm reading a little bit of back and forth that's going on on Destructoid.com because you made a comment.
2892402	2897283	You were talking about, in their comments, you were talking about how you yelled at 50 Cent, your game sucks.
2897863	2899983	His game did suck.
2900363	2904684	Let's see, DJ Tarrant wrote, booing yellow card saying, get off the stage, asshole.
2905792	2908553	and yelled at Sarah Silverman, you're not funny.
2909914	2914575	See, I think this stuff is kind of funny, but then somebody replied to you, dude, you were a total ass.
2914635	2916136	I sat three rows behind you.
2916176	2917976	You were wearing a blue X-Fire shirt.
2918317	2920317	You were a huge asshole throughout the show.
2920537	2920937	Comments?
2922778	2924279	Were you a big asshole throughout the show?
2925279	2926059	Yes, I was.
2926559	2927480	I'll admit that.
2929062	2931364	I don't see how anyone can take it seriously, though.
2932225	2933607	The show, it's terrible.
2933967	2934487	You know what?
2934628	2935308	I think it's funny.
2935448	2936289	Because you're right.
2936369	2938131	All these celebrities are just coming out.
2938191	2940213	How many of them do you think actually play games?
2940573	2943736	How much of 50 Cent's game do you think he actually played?
2944117	2950082	I think these celebrities just show up to these events because they know it's something they can add to their resume and say that they were on TV.
2952345	2952585	Right?
2952605	2952705	Right?
2953416	2954157	Yeah, definitely.
2954797	2959060	Although the guy who was Superman in Superman Returns, I can't think of his name.
2959120	2960581	Brandon Routh.
2960941	2968347	He was obviously a big Warcraft fan when he introduced the World of Warcraft Burning Crusade video.
2968707	2971529	Why did he come out there and go, Leroy Jenkins?
2971969	2972510	Did he do that?
2973050	2979615	No, but he said he had played Warcraft 2 and mentioned a lot about how he liked Blizzard, so...
2981002	2989725	It was good to see at least one gamer out there.
2990245	2990425	No.
2990505	2994266	Yeah, I cheered for Gears of War.
2994286	2997867	I haven't played it, but they definitely deserve the respect.
2999547	3001208	It's a good game if you're into first-person shooters.
3001288	3001728	It's a good game.
3002308	3004729	Alright, well, anything else you want to say about the award show?
3006639	3008501	Watch it and see if you can hear me during it.
3008761	3011822	Nah, they'll have muted you or bleeped you out.
3011842	3013423	That's why they don't air it live.
3013443	3016385	Because they're too chicken shit to air it live.
3016405	3025430	Because these celebrities' egos would be damaged if, heaven forbid, they could pick up in the background some a-hole in the bleachers, no offense, going, your game sucks.
3027852	3032174	So they're doing that post-editing right now, bleeping you out.
3032614	3033755	And probably blurring your seat.
3033775	3034616	Or maybe they'll work hard.
3035056	3035256	What?
3036087	3037107	Well, I made them work hard.
3037127	3037588	There you go.
3037608	3038388	That's all that matters.
3038688	3038988	All right.
3039488	3043830	Well, yeah, and BlackWolf in our chatroom says the crowd noise will be fake the entire show.
3043890	3044410	Most likely.
3045771	3047172	Was there a lot of thunderous applause?
3047192	3049212	Did they have the lights that say, applause, applause?
3049312	3052254	Or did they bring a girl on stage with big chi-chis?
3053594	3054955	They had a lot of seat fillers, though.
3055555	3056615	A lot of seat fillers?
3056635	3059437	Yeah.
3059677	3062838	Like the people they pay to go fill in the celebrity seats when they go to the bathroom?
3063712	3066194	Yeah, they were all in the front row, it seemed like.
3066594	3067475	Interesting, huh?
3068055	3068316	All right.
3068776	3070737	Well, thank you for the insider perspective.
3070777	3072419	And hey, try to go to some more awards.
3072579	3076422	Say, hey, if they do a G4ia this year, you definitely have to get in there and do some heckling, all right?
3077202	3078103	I'll see what I can do.
3078303	3078643	All right.
3078884	3079464	Thanks so much.
3079604	3082006	And I'll plug your show so the kids know to listen.
3082146	3089972	Hey, I'll be giving away one of those Castlevania bonus sets this week on SCFU Thursday at 7 o'clock.
3090512	3091633	Right here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3091653	3092594	That's 7 Pacific, right?
3094266	3094907	Seven Pacific.
3095387	3095927	Indeed, it is.
3098169	3098450	All right.
3098690	3101852	Have a good one, DJ Tyrant, and we'll see you on Thursday for STFU.
3102573	3102853	All right.
3103374	3103994	Thanks a lot, guys.
3104815	3105135	All right.
3105736	3112421	That was our very own DJ Tyrant giving us the scoop on what went on at the Video Game Awards and how he was a big jerk.
3112802	3113522	But you know what?
3114663	3116284	You can't take celebrities seriously.
3116885	3120428	Like if Britney Spears had come out, I would have yelled, you know, where's your panties?
3120608	3122850	You know, because of all the pictures recently.
3123579	3124400	Anyway, forget it.
3125281	3126281	Anywho, back to some news.
3127242	3138632	You know, I'm starting to think we should really curb from now on any stories that are from an analyst.
3139332	3140173	I mean, seriously.
3140974	3147039	The rumors come back up again from an analyst saying that Apple is entering the console market and they're
3148720	3160210	Take on it is basically, we think that the video game market represents a distinct possibility for Apple, especially considering that it recently announced that the availability of video games for its iPod through the iTunes Store.
3161711	3163132	That's not a reason!
3163192	3164273	That's stupid!
3164313	3165774	That's like, I don't get it.
3165934	3170438	Every fucking week on this program for the past almost five years, what do we sit here and do?
3170518	3172500	We sit here and analyze the game scene.
3172520	3173401	That's what we do.
3174041	3175863	And nobody's ever thrown money at us.
3177600	3178181	I don't get it.
3178582	3183630	These financial... If I got a degree, would they throw money at us in whatever these people have a degree in?
3183670	3184872	Market analysis or whatever?
3185433	3189640	And they don't even have to be... They're like the goddamn weatherman of the fucking...
3190433	3191114	Thank you for watching!
3208906	3210547	Here's what Apple is going to create next.
3210567	3212648	They're going to create their own line of sex toys.
3212688	3216611	You're going to have the Apple i-vibe or something like that.
3217031	3220413	I mean, seriously, that is my analyst's take on this.
3220773	3224575	Because people like having fun, therefore they like being pleasured.
3225436	3226056	There you go.
3226916	3228717	Feel the bass through the i-vibe.
3229838	3231379	Fireboma calls it the i-braider.
3231900	3233483	Eyebraider, whatever.
3233924	3236247	Seriously, this is how ridiculous these stories are.
3236728	3241737	I, for one, I will not be talking about any analyst crap from now on.
3242378	3245423	Okay, do you think it's feasible, though, that Apple could do a console?
3246008	3247369	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3267146	3268667	I think Apple's going to do that in reverse.
3269068	3274792	I think they're going to put this Trojan horse in as a movie device, and then, hey, it'll play Zuma and Bejeweled, too.
3275112	3275472	That's it.
3276093	3278415	It's not going to be able to run much anything else.
3278595	3282918	And have you tried playing any of these games on the Apple iPod?
3282998	3283939	They suck.
3284659	3287241	So, I mean, seriously.
3288102	3295187	And, you know, I hate to sound like the fucking Apple hater, but the Apple, I mean, their line of computers...
3295882	3296983	I will admit, I love my Mac.
3306414	3307714	I love my little Mac laptop.
3307895	3308655	It's great.
3308975	3311076	I consider myself bi when it comes to computers.
3311276	3312556	I like Apple sometimes.
3312596	3314077	I like PCs other days.
3315057	3321659	But I don't exactly... When I think, hey, I'm going to go play some games on the computer, I don't exactly think about my Apple computer.
3321739	3322740	And there's nothing wrong with that.
3322760	3325521	I mean, they could come out with a game console.
3325581	3331083	I just... I don't... I think it's too late in the game to come out with a new console right now.
3331443	3333843	And I think if they did it, it would fail.
3334024	3335084	It would be like, you know...
3335745	3337125	The Phantom, or something like that.
3337266	3337686	The Pippin?
3338366	3341787	BlackWolf says, apparently Tetris works really well on an iPod.
3343408	3344328	I don't know, I don't read.
3344648	3347989	My iPod was the old-ass black and white one, and it broke.
3348209	3352050	So I'm hoping I get gift certificates this Christmas so I can get myself a new one.
3352511	3356132	Great, but I heard Bejeweled blew ass, though, and that's the thing.
3357236	3358056	So great.
3358156	3361037	And at the end of the day, it's bejeweled again.
3361217	3367538	I mean, you know, you can't take this seriously as a console unless there's new things to breathe life into these consoles.
3367618	3368078	And you know what?
3368578	3373199	I will admit, there was one time, you know, with Apple II, that they had good games on there.
3373419	3380121	I mean, you know, you had some pretty good stuff on the Apple II, but that day is long past.
3380561	3380681	So...
3383905	3384285	Little Britain
3411730	3416494	It's a show that's run in the UK and also on BBC America.
3416514	3418636	Yeah, it's on BBC America here.
3418656	3419617	DVDs do very well here, too.
3419637	3424901	It's actually a parody of Life in Britain, and they've got a bunch of different characters in there.
3424921	3428184	It almost reminds me a little bit of a modern take on, say...
3431331	3431932	Monty Python
3449105	3450927	It's pretty funny looking from what I've seen so far.
3450947	3453048	What the hell are you going to do with the Little Britain game?
3453068	3456371	Don't get me wrong, I love the show, but I can't really picture it as a game.
3456431	3460094	I mean, are you going to go around yelling, I am the only game in the village?
3460674	3468020	No, that was funny that you mentioned that, because actually that was one of the advertisements on the story.
3468080	3470902	They said, you know, I am the only game in the village.
3471342	3476546	No, there's actually one, though, one scene that I saw where you're riding around...
3478179	3484322	Trying to basically scare away the other gays that are in the village so that you can become the only gay in the village.
3485823	3486343	It's funny.
3486623	3489464	It's basically going to be a collection of minigames.
3489504	3494207	Is there going to be a music game for rap for the one girl that goes, No, but yeah, but yeah, but yeah.
3495067	3497088	You know her that tells all the stories and stuff?
3497588	3504391	Basically, anyways, so the game is going to be, like I said, a collection of minigames presented in the format of an episode of the TV show.
3504451	3505592	And since players can enter...
3506544	3516028	You can get interactive with their favorite sketch show characters in a series of eight minigames featuring Lou and Andy, Vicky Pillard, Mr. Man, Emily and Florence,
3523320	3528807	Majore Dawes, Daphne Thomas, Judy and Maggie, and Letty.
3529368	3532492	It says, each minigame plays like a sketch from the TV show.
3532612	3537799	To win the game, players must progress through all the sketches to the end of the show, or the credits will roll.
3538500	3539021	And, um,
3540046	3542068	I don't know, they have... And that's coming out here in America, too?
3542588	3543249	I don't think so.
3543269	3544350	I think it's only in the UK.
3544831	3545952	It's coming out on PC.
3546012	3547513	Damn, because you won't even be able to import that.
3547653	3548654	Oh, if it's PC, you can.
3548734	3550877	PC, PlayStation Portable.
3551057	3552398	You can get the PlayStation Portable version.
3552418	3552979	Ah, okay, cool.
3553299	3554860	And PlayStation 2.
3554920	3558824	The PlayStation 2 and PC versions will be out January 22nd.
3560866	3563188	and then May for the PSP version.
3563228	3566430	So we can import the PSP one, which might be fun.
3567090	3568311	What's his name from Buffy in it?
3568671	3569432	Anthony Stewart Head?
3569512	3569932	Is that his name?
3569992	3570352	Is he in it?
3570873	3571513	I'm not sure.
3572114	3574215	But they've got examples here.
3574535	3575916	Here's a screenshot.
3576076	3577097	Really great radio here.
3577497	3580099	But it's one of the minigames where you're smashing objects.
3580960	3581400	Okay.
3582000	3583401	I don't know.
3583461	3584902	Smashing frogs, it looks like.
3585403	3586743	So, I don't know.
3587124	3587804	It'll be funny.
3589425	3589845	Interesting.
3591161	3592882	I'm sure it'll be a good game.
3593962	3598444	Anywho, so, kind of moving on to a completely different topic here.
3598884	3600224	The Xbox 360.
3600524	3602985	Well, we know that it has an HD DVD drive.
3603625	3604806	Well, guess what?
3604866	3610048	It's going to be, people are using it to copy HD DVDs to rip them to their PC.
3610928	3619891	Because the HD DVD drive uses a USB port and a connection, or USB connection, and can be, you know, you can do the
3621160	3633485	1080p connection over component cables, you can actually use a video capture card to capture that and then dump it, of course, to your hard drive for backup purposes only, of course.
3634085	3638887	Of course, you know, the PlayStation 3, I think, does the same thing with Blu-ray.
3638967	3641068	I mean, I don't know.
3641368	3648651	But later on, I suppose, when they're going to require the HDMI cables, that might be able to circumvent some of this stuff.
3648691	3649271	But right now,
3650263	3652564	You can dump them via that.
3652924	3653284	I don't know.
3653664	3655845	Oh, I'm sure this has the movie industry so excited.
3656585	3656985	Whatever.
3657045	3660246	I mean, it's their own fault that they couldn't figure out a way to encrypt it.
3661667	3664588	I still don't know what movies I really want on HD DVD.
3664628	3666669	I guess I'm still waiting for the format to kind of take off.
3666749	3667569	That's the thing, too.
3667689	3670330	Like, there was a movie that I wanted, but it's only on Blu-ray.
3671610	3672010	Interesting.
3672030	3672971	And that's annoying.
3672991	3674931	Well, you're going to get a PlayStation 3 eventually, right?
3675572	3675992	Maybe.
3676092	3676952	I mean, I don't know.
3677012	3677612	Probably.
3679193	3679553	Interesting.
3680275	3684378	I got berated by the wife because she's like, I thought you said you weren't going to get one of those.
3685719	3689141	I'm like, but you just got excited about the, you know, Motorstorm games, so.
3690382	3694604	All right, well, moving on to some ads that were about the PlayStation 3.
3694845	3702750	They were run by Circuit City, and Joystick picked up some of these Circuit City ads, running it under the headline, Circuit City Faults or Stupid Advertising?
3702790	3703330	You decide.
3703370	3709334	That's, again, on Joystick with a Q dot com, which is interesting because they talk about some things from the catalog that,
3710466	3712989	PlayStation 3, Ready to Rumble, It's Hot
3732036	3736718	Even if you have a wired controller, the Xbox Guide button glows green with what player you're in.
3736998	3740520	Well, of course, in the picture, obviously it's posed.
3740600	3742120	I mean, they're not really playing the game.
3742160	3743301	This isn't too hard to figure out.
3743381	3749903	But, of course, the anal gamer will notice that the lights are off, and so, in fact, the controllers are not plugged in.
3752544	3754224	Did you see the one with the Wii, though, on there?
3754525	3755605	No, I missed that one.
3756432	3765897	There's a picture with the Wii saying that the Wii can be played without a TV because it has a built-in projector into it.
3767438	3767778	What?
3768999	3769839	I'm serious.
3770300	3772821	Wasn't that one of the old rumors about the Wii?
3772841	3778704	It was one of the old rumors, but that's how... Somebody did not get the memo.
3779985	3784868	It's really bad, but... How does this...
3786360	3786980	Get through.
3787000	3791983	I mean, seriously, how does this get by without people noticing this stuff?
3792123	3792763	So seriously.
3793544	3798186	Because there's no gamers that work at Circuit City's proofreading department?
3798386	3799186	No, here it is right here.
3799366	3802088	It's actually, take a look at the story again.
3802528	3813313	It says the USB port lets you plug in the game system to a project and play, or to project and play on awesome 11 and a half foot widescreen.
3814033	3814774	And that was for the Wii.
3814794	3814994	What?
3817150	3818011	That might actually be for the 360.
3819572	3820873	Whatever, it's still wrong.
3821453	3822334	It doesn't matter.
3823955	3832421	No, yeah, it says the turned-off Xbox 360 controller is playing Madden on a projection television supposedly attached to the Xbox 360 by a USB cable.
3834203	3834643	Interesting.
3836564	3836905	Whatever.
3837605	3839547	Obviously all that stuff's posed, you know.
3840187	3841968	People read a little bit too much into that stuff.
3842649	3845051	Well, you may not be able to actually...
3846398	3873859	have a projector built into your Xbox 360 or Wii but you can make your own Power Glove and that's what someone's done actually they have modified a Power Glove to put a black Wii remote on it and they've captured the hearts of geeks everywhere for about five minutes until the next video comes out with something else even more shinier I don't know it's
3874377	3877139	It's stupid, but I'm sure someone was bound to do it at some point.
3877859	3882182	And I'm sure someone has commented on this video, It's so bad.
3884583	3889406	Let me see how many posts it took to say it's so bad.
3890207	3892268	You know, I am actually surprised.
3892888	3893489	Oh, oh, oh.
3894509	3895050	Eight posts.
3895230	3895810	Eight posts.
3895930	3896251	All right.
3896511	3896871	There you go.
3898139	3902261	Speaking of things that are so bad, this is so bad it's good.
3902341	3903401	I mean like so awesome.
3903561	3904542	You know, bad meaning good.
3905202	3905642	Get this.
3906643	3910804	The DS Lite has some new decals being made for it.
3910844	3914486	You can turn your DS Lite, you know, you can use the decals to change your DS Lite.
3914866	3917167	And they're being sold by Sanrio.
3917547	3918167	That's right.
3918567	3919988	You can make your DS Lite...
3920407	3922689	The Hello Kitty DS Lite.
3922969	3924550	Oh, how fun is that going to be?
3925171	3931976	For the low, low price of 680 yen, that's about $5.90, you can get this from Sanrio.
3932416	3933317	Oh, so awesome.
3933357	3936039	And they look best, by the way, on the pink DSs, just so you know.
3936859	3937140	Goody.
3937680	3940362	Just more reason for me to get a pink DS Lite this Christmas.
3941343	3945106	Well, those pink DS Lites are going for a lot of money, actually, on eBay from what I've been hearing.
3945166	3945466	Really?
3945886	3947948	Of course, my customers... Aren't they still in stock in most places?
3948108	3948228	Yeah.
3949173	3950693	eBay people are selling out of them quick.
3950933	3951313	Interesting.
3951794	3956555	Anyways, apparently Canada is blinging up your DS stylus.
3957915	3965776	Future Shop, you can actually purchase a 18 karat gold stylus for the low, low price of $19.99.
3965817	3972758	And wow, Neil, that would really suck if you lost that one because...
3973979	3975680	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3995017	3998199	Alright, well something else I'm sure people are going to be paying a lot of money for.
3998639	4000680	Depends if they decide to charge for this or not.
4001021	4007505	But there is a huge, rabid fan base around the television show that used to be on the air called Firefly.
4007965	4010506	And you might remember they made it into a movie as well called Serenity.
4011047	4016250	I didn't really follow the TV show, but Extifer, my roommate, is a huge weed and whore.
4016490	4018051	You know, Buffy and Angel and all that.
4018365	4021146	So I got dragged to see Serenity the day it opened, and it wasn't bad.
4021326	4022466	It was pretty good.
4022746	4025647	If I did get an HD DVD player, I would buy Serenity.
4026107	4030068	Serenity would be a good movie for HD, or any sci-fi movie, really, would be a good HD movie.
4030148	4031369	Well, that's not what I'm reporting on.
4031409	4036610	What I'm talking about is that this has been licensed for an MMO.
4037030	4043492	Multiverse has struck a deal with Fox to put the Firefly property into the MMO ring.
4043612	4045572	Now, keep in mind, this is very early on.
4045592	4047673	There's no development team yet put together like this.
4048066	4052988	But they want to do a type of Star Wars Galaxy type game.
4053308	4057490	But they say they will make it unique and fun and interesting.
4057891	4059531	So it probably won't happen until 2008.
4060812	4062713	But that could be very interesting.
4062733	4067135	And there's certainly a huge fan base out there that will at least check this out for Curiosity Factor alone.
4067835	4068315	Wouldn't you think?
4068836	4069296	I think so.
4069916	4072397	I'd even check it out, even though I don't know much about the series.
4072698	4074698	It's like, you know, Space Cowboys.
4074919	4075359	I mean, it's...
4076092	4076933	Definitely unique.
4076993	4079074	And who doesn't love cowboys in outer space?
4079434	4081895	You gotta love the fact that the show's been cancelled.
4082776	4086098	You know, and the series has been cancelled and it's not coming back.
4086118	4087719	There's not going to be a sequel to Serenity.
4087739	4089180	Yeah, but isn't that what happened to Star Trek?
4089840	4093662	The original Star Trek got cancelled pretty early on and then they made a movie and it became huge.
4093742	4098285	But then again, Serenity unfortunately did not quite have a huge box office success.
4098305	4099826	They should have called it Firefly the movie.
4100706	4101607	Eh, oh well.
4103078	4106940	Anyway, that's our last story for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
