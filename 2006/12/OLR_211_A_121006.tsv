7000	12000	We're the hosts, Bart Sakura, Sky, and Moto.
13000	16000	Tonight, December 10th, 2006.
16000	22000	Microsoft gets sued over brick 360s, the old Apple entering the console market rumor resurfaces,
22000	25000	and is the Playstation 3 harming the acceptance of Blu-ray?
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37000	43000	We are that video game program dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts and unfortunately not joining us this week is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
49000	52000	But we do have the ferret to speak for her in her plays.
52000	59000	She's actually in L.A. this week. She's spinning around on the teacups back at Disneyland.
59000	61000	I know, again? She's at Disneyland again?
61000	64000	Well, she's there with Chris and oh well.
64000	65000	She's not here this week.
65000	70000	She was going to call in with a special report, but I guess she got too dizzy because I didn't see anything on the Skype line.
70000	72000	So, maybe she'll bug us later. I don't know.
72000	75000	But in the meantime, the one and only Loki is joining us here tonight.
75000	77000	Yes, I am.
77000	78000	Alright, how you doing?
78000	79000	I'm doing okay.
79000	83000	Alright. It's kind of weird because we haven't been live in a while.
83000	85000	Like, since before Thanksgiving.
85000	88000	You know, we missed that show Thanksgiving week and then we were pre-taped last week.
88000	95000	And now, this week, it doesn't feel like a full thing because it's just you and me and there's no Dark Sakura.
95000	100000	There's no special guests yet, although supposedly Miklotov's going to be here.
100000	104000	But, like, an hour before we went live, they were like,
104000	111000	Bye! We're going to go play DDR at the bowling alley. And I'm like, dude, I've been wanting to go check out the machine for like three weeks.
111000	113000	What machine?
113000	117000	There's supposedly a DDR Supernova at the bowling alley at Country Club.
117000	119000	At the Ultra Ghetto Club?
119000	122000	Oh, I hear Keys. They might be back now. I don't know. We'll see.
122000	127000	Well, in the meanwhile, while we figure out what's going on there, we'll start off the show how we always do it with a little bit of
127000	129000	How was your gaming week? Loki, how was your gaming week?
129000	136000	My gaming week is okay. I actually tried out Viva Pinata and I played it for about half an hour.
136000	140000	Until which the game decided I don't want to play it anymore.
140000	146000	Which is ironic because I really didn't want to play it anymore because, well, it froze up on me.
146000	150000	And the game itself was just very kind of boring.
150000	156000	I mean, I got really bored with it really quick, so I plan on selling it back since I didn't pay for it in the first place.
156000	161000	So, I don't know. Can't recommend it, but I guess if you stick with it long enough it might be fun.
161000	164000	I just found it very, very, very annoying.
164000	165000	So, whatever.
165000	169000	Played more Excite Truck because that's fun. Played more Wii Sports.
169000	171000	We've been doing more of the Wii Sports bowling.
171000	175000	And my friend who's, you know, used to be in a bowling league was kicking our ass.
175000	177000	So, whatever.
177000	186000	And then, I don't know, just waiting for Elibits this week and actually I'm going to probably try to pick up Far Cry Vengeance as well.
186000	188000	So, those would be fun.
188000	193000	And, you know, more Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories.
193000	196000	And, I don't know. That's pretty much it.
196000	206000	I know, was it, on Tuesday actually I'm going to be hooking up the Wii in our kind of giant theater at work that we have.
206000	209000	For a demonstration for all the sales staff.
209000	212000	And it's going to be kind of cool because we get to use my wireless sensor bar that I made.
212000	215000	So, I'm going to be playing the Wii on a giant screen.
215000	217000	I actually tried it out on Friday and it worked out pretty good.
217000	220000	So, looking forward to that.
220000	224000	But, in the meantime, just kind of kicking back and waiting for some better games to come out.
224000	229000	And, from the looks of things, it's going to be a little bit before some good stuff comes out.
229000	233000	I do have a real quick story though that's unrelated to games slightly.
233000	234000	Oh, sure. Why not?
234000	236000	We went go-kart racing today.
236000	241000	And I'm not talking about the crappy go-karts at Golf Land, but actual indoor go-kart tracks.
241000	245000	You know, the karts that go up to about 40 miles an hour and type stuff.
245000	247000	Is that that little place right up here?
247000	249000	I've always wanted to go there.
249000	250000	Yeah.
250000	255000	Other than the fact that it hurts the hell out of my hands driving those things because there's no power steering on them, of course.
255000	264000	I was able to successfully drift at 40 miles an hour thanks to video games because of how I learned to drift in Ridge Racer.
264000	269000	The same logic applies and I was able to drift around corners pretty quick.
269000	270000	And that's pretty awesome.
270000	272000	So, you can learn something from games.
272000	275000	What was the reason that you decided to go to RPM today?
275000	278000	My dad's birthday. We took him down there.
278000	281000	What made him decide to do RPM of all places?
281000	283000	He likes race cars.
283000	286000	He likes to drag cars and everything.
286000	289000	So, we thought it would be fun to go down there because I've never been down there.
289000	293000	My sister asked. She actually goes down there quite a bit. She has a membership and stuff.
293000	294000	So, I got a membership.
294000	299000	It's kind of cool though because you have to suit up and like the whole jumpsuit and the helmet and everything.
299000	301000	And there's people there that they have memberships.
301000	302000	They buy their own helmets.
302000	305000	They have their own jumpsuits, their own racing gloves.
305000	306000	And it's just crazy.
306000	308000	But it's pretty fun.
308000	310000	They time your laps and everything.
310000	312000	And you're basically racing against the clock.
312000	316000	It sucks that the second car I got, because it's kind of like QZAR in a sense,
316000	319000	the second car I got really sucked and the tires were all fucked up on it.
319000	321000	So, it wouldn't grip it.
321000	323000	I kept spinning it out and hitting the wall.
323000	325000	And I don't know. It was fun though.
325000	328000	Can you imagine what Loki must be like at one of these places?
331000	333000	Yes, that's right. The music's starting.
334000	336000	And it's like, oh, it's like initial D.
336000	341000	D! Ready, set, go!
343000	348000	Everything I need to know here I learned from initial D!
348000	350000	Mega Drift!
352000	356000	Damn, I left my little stupid Sega card at home. What am I going to do?
356000	360000	It was fun though. I mean, really, we should go do it.
360000	361000	Like this show.
361000	366000	I think it would be fun. I think that's something we should put on YouTube.
366000	368000	We could too, because you could film it.
368000	370000	Only if we get loaded before we go.
372000	374000	Don't drink and drive, kids. We're only kidding.
374000	376000	But I thought I'd mention that though.
376000	380000	Oh, and I played a bit of Motorstorm at Kiosk at Best Buy.
380000	382000	And I like it. I think it's kind of cool.
382000	387000	But it's a lot slower though than Excite Truck.
387000	391000	To be honest, I really wish that EA would do a Burnout off-road series.
391000	394000	You know what Motorstorm did for me?
397000	399000	Oh, this game sucks!
399000	401000	That was Motorstorm.
402000	404000	That's it. I played it at Target.
404000	407000	Hi, Miklotov! You decided to join us after all.
407000	410000	Yeah, we just got back from the bowling alley. How's my mic?
410000	412000	I think you're okay. I might have to turn you up a little bit.
412000	413000	But how are you doing?
413000	414000	I'm tired now.
414000	416000	So you guys want to go play the new DDR without me?
416000	417000	Yeah.
417000	419000	Well, not the new, new DDR.
419000	420000	The newest DDR.
420000	422000	The newest DDR to us in Sacramento. How was it?
422000	426000	Oh, I didn't realize how stupid I am when I make steps sometimes.
426000	428000	Oh, that's right, because you do steps for the game.
428000	435000	Yeah, and we had to redo some steps a while ago for the UltraMix 1 songs.
435000	439000	Like, I played Gorgeous 2012 on doubles and I played heavy.
439000	442000	I don't know if many people realize, but it has new heavy steps.
442000	445000	And so I was playing and I was like, oh, yeah, I remember making these. These are fun.
445000	449000	And then it got to utter crap. I was like, what was I thinking?
449000	453000	And then I just gave up and died.
453000	456000	Was there a large crowd there playing DDR?
456000	461000	If me and Irene are a large crowd, then yeah, there was a very large crowd.
461000	465000	All right, I'm trying to fix your mic here. How else was your gaming week?
465000	469000	I played more Elite Beat Agents, trying to S everything on hard rock.
469000	471000	Wow, I can hear myself.
471000	472000	You're supposed to be able to.
472000	476000	OK, yeah, I played Elite Beat Agents.
476000	482000	I started playing Zelda again, and the fourth dungeon boss is the best boss fight I've ever played in my life.
482000	484000	It was so cool.
484000	490000	And I don't think I did anything else besides that.
490000	492000	So it's just been Zelda all week long?
492000	494000	No, because I don't play video games anymore.
494000	497000	I hope you've been playing PSP and DS and all that stuff.
497000	499000	PSP? When did I say I played PSP?
499000	500000	Or DS. I'm fine, DS.
500000	502000	Elite Beat Agents.
502000	503000	That's it?
503000	504000	Yes.
504000	510000	It's my favorite game that I have on DS called Elite Beat Agents.
510000	513000	Say hello as well to someone else who's here.
513000	515000	Say hello to Rice Princess.
515000	516000	God, we haven't seen you in forever.
516000	517000	Yeah, it's been a while.
517000	519000	How was your gaming week? What have you been playing?
519000	521000	Nothing.
521000	522000	Elite Beat Agents.
522000	525000	You've got to get real close to the mic. These mics are not very sensitive.
525000	526000	What have you been playing?
526000	527000	Can you take a guess?
527000	528000	I can.
528000	529000	What is it, Jay?
529000	532000	It rhymes with ka-wow.
532000	533000	You'd be right.
533000	536000	It rhymes with World of BoarCraft.
536000	539000	Yeah, shut up.
539000	542000	That would be W.A.B.
542000	545000	Are you saying the World of BoarCraft?
545000	547000	Yes, you are World of BoarCraft.
547000	552000	What server are you on? What character class are you?
552000	556000	What are you doing in the W.A.B.?
556000	560000	I'm on Elder Thallus and I BVB.
560000	562000	All day long?
562000	564000	All day long.
564000	566000	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
566000	567000	All right.
567000	568000	Yep.
568000	569000	Well, have fun with your W.A.B.
569000	570000	I'll do that.
570000	571000	All right.
571000	572000	Chirp, chirp, chirp.
572000	575000	My gaming week, not a whole lot of new stuff.
575000	581000	I decided to go back and rediscover GameTap because I haven't been playing it a lot lately,
581000	584000	and so I decided to load that up, and they actually have some cool new stuff on there
584000	588000	because they have the Castlevania games and Contra games from the old school 8-bit NES
588000	593000	are on there, and Silent Hill 2 is on GameTap, which it looks very nice.
593000	594000	I was very surprised.
594000	598000	It looks better than it does on PS2 because it uses the advanced hardware on the computer
598000	600000	to give the smoother textures and things.
600000	603000	I was very, very pleased with that, and you can really control the resolution and everything,
603000	604000	so that was really cool.
604000	606000	And Civilization III.
606000	609000	For those who have listened to the show in the past, you guys know I love Civilization.
609000	611000	It's my favorite PC game of all time.
611000	617000	Yet, Civilization II was such a shock to me that I just wrote off the series altogether.
617000	622000	I had played Colonization, which was kind of cool, but I wrote off the series with Civilization II
622000	624000	because I'm like, this is too much.
624000	626000	So I never did play Civ III or Civ IV.
626000	631000	I never spent the money on it, but I went back and played Civ III, and it's not bad.
631000	633000	I like it a little more than Civ II.
633000	637000	It seems to be a little bit truer to the original than Civ II was, so I'm kind of liking it.
637000	638000	I'm going to go play it some more.
638000	639000	Good times.
639000	641000	Maybe I'll have to play some OLR listeners, because it's multiple.
641000	646000	Although, I don't even know anyone else with GameTap besides our webmaster, VX JasonXV.
646000	648000	I'm still waiting for Myst Online to come out on there.
648000	650000	I have not played the Sam & Max game yet, though.
650000	651000	I will at some point.
651000	652000	Definitely play that.
652000	658000	Otherwise, I decided, based on a new forum we have in our Orange Launch Radio forums,
658000	662000	there's a PC gaming forum, and somebody had posted a thread about what freeware games
662000	664000	have you been playing.
664000	668000	And I think Dartetsuya made a post that reminded me that there's a freeware game called Every
668000	672000	Extend, which the PSP game Every Extend Extra is based off of.
672000	676000	So I decided, well, I played the Every Extend Extra demo, and I really sucked at it, so
676000	679000	I wanted to see if maybe I could try and pick up the game again.
679000	682000	So I downloaded Every Extend, and it's actually pretty fun.
682000	687000	It was a lot of fun, so much so that I decided to spend the $20 and get Every Extend Extra
687000	688000	on the PSP.
688000	691000	So I'll know more about that game next week when I've actually played it some more.
691000	692000	You found it today?
692000	693000	Yes, it was actually easy to find.
693000	695000	GameStop has it cut down to $20.
695000	698000	Too bad GameStop is evil, but wow.
698000	702000	Well, you know, I'll get it wherever I can get it, because I use their online search
702000	705000	for the store to shut up.
705000	707000	Also, I got a present.
707000	708000	Loki got me a Christmas present.
708000	709000	Can I play it right now?
709000	710000	I got Final Fantasy III on the DS.
710000	711000	No, you may not.
711000	712000	Please?
712000	713000	No, you may not.
713000	714000	Well, I'm going to punch you in the face.
714000	715000	Then I will play it.
715000	719000	Only I get to de-virginize my cartridge.
719000	722000	You know that feeling, like when you buy a new game, you don't want someone else to
722000	723000	crap out your-
723000	724000	Have sex with it first?
724000	727000	Or someone else to crap up your game with their save file, right?
727000	731000	It's like, you want to be the first one to turn it on, see the opening cinema, all
731000	732000	that stuff.
732000	734000	You don't want someone else to skank it up.
734000	737000	So, I don't want you to dirty up my game.
737000	740000	So, maybe next time you're here.
740000	741000	That's in forever from now.
741000	744000	It's not my fault you're going away for Christmas.
744000	745000	I think it is.
745000	749000	So, I'll know more about Final Fantasy III next week, because I just got it like 10 minutes
749000	750000	ago from Loki.
750000	751000	You rock, Loki.
751000	752000	Thank you so much.
752000	755000	You know what else I got for Christmas from Extrofer?
755000	756000	I got my Christmas present from Extrofer today.
756000	757000	I was there.
757000	760000	No, I did not get an STD reference.
760000	766000	I got a Hello Kitty toaster.
766000	767000	I'm so excited.
767000	768000	I can't wait.
768000	769000	I need bread.
769000	770000	I need bread.
770000	772000	I'm having my Christmas present.
772000	773000	What?
773000	775000	That'll be my Christmas present.
775000	776000	Awesome.
776000	779000	When you got it, did you make a high-pitched squealing noise?
779000	780000	I did.
780000	783000	I thought I heard you from the bathroom.
783000	788000	Hopefully, that was me and not something, you know, some bathroom noise.
788000	789000	What?
789000	791000	Anyway, no, nothing.
791000	793000	I guess that's it for my gaming week.
793000	796000	I don't really have anything else to share.
796000	800000	So, anyway, let's go to a little bit of housekeeping.
800000	804000	And I mentioned that there were some new forums on our website at orangesontradiocom, and
804000	806000	you should definitely go check those out.
806000	811000	There's a new PC gaming forum available on orangesontradiocom, and every weeknight show
811000	813000	has their own forum now.
813000	818000	So if you're a Pump Up the Volume fan, she's got a whole forum there, Dark Sakura.
818000	821000	And if you like guys on a show, there's a forum for that.
821000	827000	STFU on Thursdays, Travis Donovan on Saturdays, and something on Fridays.
827000	830000	And then also we're in the process of revamping our news blog.
830000	834000	So take a look for that this coming week.
834000	835000	Let's get into some gaming news now.
835000	838000	We'll start it off with a little news about the Xbox 360.
838000	843000	But this is the type of news that Microsoft is not going to be happy to hear.
843000	852000	One of the Xbox Live users who goes by the name of Redrum6622, Redrum, Redrum, I love
852000	858000	the shining, claims he's filed a class action lawsuit against Microsoft because of some
858000	861000	problems he had after their recent fall system update.
861000	865000	This was posted on the official Xbox forum, so you can kind of take this with a grain
865000	870000	of salt because it's an official Xbox forum post and those can be a little crazy.
870000	875000	He basically said he filed this class action lawsuit, plaintiff versus Microsoft Corporation,
875000	877000	a Washington Corporation, blah, blah, blah.
877000	880000	And then their summary of claims, blah, blah, blah, legal mumbo jumbo one.
880000	884000	This is a class action against Microsoft and its affiliates for breach of contract, violation
884000	888000	of the Washington Consumer Protection Act, and alternatively negligence.
888000	891000	Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and all other persons who experienced
891000	896000	hardware problems with their Microsoft 360 gaming consoles following installation of
896000	900000	Microsoft's fall 2006 update for the Xbox 360.
900000	904000	The parties, plaintiff, name blocked, is an individual resident of California.
904000	908000	Plaintiff is the original purchaser and current owner of an Xbox 360 gaming console.
908000	912000	Plaintiff brings this action individually and as a class action under Rule 23 of the
912000	917000	Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of the class specified herein, blah, blah,
917000	920000	blah, blah, ipso facto, et cetera, et cetera.
920000	921000	What do you think, Logy?
921000	926000	But he's saying that it's in violation of Washington law, yet he's a California resident.
926000	928000	Supposedly, that's what it is, yeah.
928000	934000	Okay, and the other fact that the fall update only affected, the glitch in the fall update,
934000	937000	I guess, only affected less than 1% of the 360s out there.
937000	939000	You have to admit that's still a lot, though.
939000	944000	Okay, that's true, to which any of them that were affected by that were immediately fixed
944000	947000	and replaced, you know, if you called the 1-800 number.
947000	950000	So it's not like they're saying, fuck you, you're just out of 360.
950000	952000	They're doing, you know, their part to fix it.
952000	956000	So this is just some dumbass Californian who's trying to get more money from them.
956000	959000	Pooh-fucking-hoo, your damn 360 broke.
959000	962000	Send it in like everybody else and just get a new one.
962000	965000	God, is it really that big a deal?
965000	970000	ShadowNextGen in our chat room, which, by the way, hi, chat room, chat.orangelauntrader.com
970000	971000	if you want to join.
971000	973000	ShadowNextGen said, do just once attention.
973000	974000	Is that what's going on?
974000	975000	He does once attention.
975000	978000	Well, now you have his gamertag, so fucking send him hate mail.
978000	979000	There you go.
979000	985000	OL Army Alex says, I can't prove my 360 having died, though my useless posts in the forums
985000	987000	and having called MS support twice count.
987000	992000	In other words, like how are you going to prove that your 360 was bricked?
992000	993000	I don't know.
993000	995000	I guess that's an interesting idea.
995000	997000	Let's see.
997000	999000	There was another comment here.
999000	1001000	Oh, Jumpman said, my 360 died.
1001000	1004000	Microsoft gave me a new one and all is right with the world.
1004000	1005000	See?
1005000	1006000	Is it that hard?
1006000	1010000	I mean, they're aware of the problem and they were fixing them.
1010000	1012000	So, what more do you want them to do?
1012000	1013000	Fucking give you a blowjob or something?
1013000	1016000	I mean, seriously, just this guy...
1016000	1018000	You're a little bit feisty tonight.
1018000	1019000	He needs to...
1019000	1020000	Go ahead with your class action lawsuit.
1020000	1021000	Who leveled your feathers before the show tonight?
1021000	1022000	No, no, no.
1022000	1023000	Go ahead with your class action lawsuit.
1023000	1025000	Just because you have a lawsuit doesn't mean you're going to win.
1025000	1029000	I hope you waste all the money in the world and I hope your 360 doesn't work afterwards.
1029000	1031000	So, fuck you.
1031000	1034000	Macman in our chat says it's about time someone sued Microsoft.
1034000	1036000	Rise, my iMac.
1036000	1038000	Rise from your grave.
1038000	1039000	Get it?
1039000	1040000	Altered Beast reference?
1040000	1041000	Get it?
1041000	1042000	Altered Beast.
1042000	1043000	That's a good game.
1043000	1044000	I know.
1044000	1045000	Altered Beast.
1045000	1046000	I said I won't buy it on Virtual Console.
1046000	1047000	Not for eight bucks.
1047000	1049000	Not when it's not the arcade version.
1049000	1055000	Anyways, so, more craziness, 360 related, of course, this week.
1055000	1063000	On Monday, during Monday Night Football, the first kind of teaser trailer for Halo 3 was
1063000	1065000	aired on TV in the course.
1065000	1070000	Everybody and their brother basically took this and decided, hey, you know what, be fun.
1070000	1075000	Let's change the music on it, just like we did with the Mad World ad for Heroes of War.
1075000	1078000	You know, I thought it was a pretty cool trailer.
1078000	1080000	I mean, I like it.
1080000	1083000	It's just like it has the same impact as the first one, I think.
1083000	1086000	The first teaser during E3.
1086000	1088000	I'm really psyched for the game.
1088000	1092000	Hopefully, we'll hear something from the beta, you know, despite the fact that there's
1092000	1096000	probably going to be, you know, tight lipped.
1096000	1098000	I swear I could not sign up for the beta.
1098000	1100000	I tried like 50 times and I couldn't get in on it.
1100000	1101000	Stupid sight.
1101000	1104000	It was funny because they had the link up for the beta before the beta thing even launched,
1104000	1106000	so I signed up then.
1106000	1107000	Yeah, so did I.
1107000	1108000	I didn't have to worry about the feature.
1108000	1110000	Well, la di da di, you both.
1110000	1114000	But, some of us have to actually work at work and can't refresh constantly.
1114000	1116000	This is not me on the site.
1116000	1117000	I didn't hit refresh constantly.
1117000	1121000	I read it in a blog and then I went and signed up.
1121000	1125000	I also signed up for Shadowrun, so hopefully I get in on one of those.
1125000	1131000	Because, to be honest, the last one I played was Test Drive Unlimited and, you know,
1131000	1134000	just the PlayStation 2 version is not as good as the 360 one.
1134000	1137000	But, yeah, Halo 3 looks cool.
1137000	1140000	I mean, we know it's going to be pretty good.
1140000	1145000	So, just have to wait until they tease us with more shit.
1145000	1148000	Of course, many folks in our chat room are talking about how they signed up for the beta.
1148000	1152000	Jeremy Todd 1 says, I signed up for the beta, but still, there's like.9% of actually getting
1152000	1153000	into the beta.
1153000	1155000	Too many Halo fanboys.
1155000	1157000	But, here's the thing, though.
1157000	1160000	There's going to be more ways to get into the beta as the weeks go along.
1160000	1164000	This is straight from my EA rep because we were like, once we saw that the beta...
1164000	1166000	The fuck does EA know about Halo, though?
1166000	1167000	Not EA.
1167000	1168000	I'm sorry.
1168000	1169000	Microsoft.
1169000	1170000	My Microsoft rep.
1170000	1171000	Good job.
1171000	1172000	Good job, Loki.
1172000	1173000	Sorry.
1173000	1174000	Whatever.
1174000	1175000	He's human, folks.
1175000	1179000	I was looking at something that said EA and, you know, it's a slip.
1179000	1184000	Anyways, yeah, my Microsoft rep because we were like, hey, how can you get us into this
1184000	1185000	beta?
1185000	1186000	Come on.
1186000	1187000	Pull some strings.
1187000	1189000	And, he's like, no.
1189000	1197680	I want to play some pimps at sea, as it was called when folks were spotting them on Xbox
1197680	1200680	Live this week, testing Halo 3.
1200680	1204280	You really think we're going to have to wait all the way to next Thanksgiving for this
1204280	1205280	game?
1205280	1209000	I mean, jeez, they're advertising it like it's coming out tomorrow, it seems like, with
1209000	1210000	all this hype.
1210000	1217640	I don't think we'll have to wait, and to be honest, I really...
1217640	1221880	They're pretty much, you know, if they're going in the beta, I mean, the game's almost
1221880	1222880	done then.
1222880	1227160	I mean, they wouldn't be going in the beta if it was, you know, being put out in November.
1227160	1229120	I mean, that's a perfect example right there.
1229120	1233240	The beta test is in the spring because it's a beta test.
1233240	1235960	It means the game's right about to come out.
1235960	1243640	So, you know, I think it's definitely going to be hitting the, probably the stores around
1243640	1244640	the end of March.
1244640	1245640	Oh, I see.
1245640	1246640	Mid-March.
1246640	1249560	There's going to be some interesting stuff, though, because this, you know, beta sign-up
1249560	1254240	was mainly for the US and North America type stuff.
1254240	1259560	However, if you're in the UK, there's going to be a few ways you can get signed up, and
1259560	1264340	there's actually quite a list of websites, depending on which country you're in, that
1264340	1265580	you can sign up.
1265580	1268720	They have limited slots for the beta available.
1268720	1282480	Such sites, for example, the UK Rewired Mine, 360 Monster, BritXBox, msxboxworld.com, totally360.com,
1282480	1288720	and of course, Germany's got a bunch of different sites, well, PlanetXBox, et cetera.
1288720	1291120	So, you know, definitely take a look out there.
1291120	1293720	There's tons of links.
1293720	1296800	I know IGN ran a story with some of this stuff.
1296800	1301600	So, if you're looking to get signed up and you don't live in the United States, then
1301600	1306880	definitely check these out, because they haven't finished their beta sign-ups yet.
1306880	1312480	You know, I suck at Halo, like I'm really, really bad at Halo, but I think the game is
1312480	1317400	presented just beautifully, and you know, I'm getting suckered into this marketing campaign
1317400	1318640	stuff a little bit.
1318640	1320080	My hype meter's going up a little bit.
1320080	1321080	I'm excited for this.
1321080	1326200	I've played Halo 2 maybe twice in my life.
1326200	1327680	When are you going to get Halo 3?
1327680	1328680	I'll get Halo 3.
1328680	1329680	Sucker.
1329680	1330680	Why?
1330680	1331680	It's a first-person shooter.
1331680	1332680	It looks fun.
1332680	1333680	It'll be fun.
1333680	1334680	I'm sure it'll be good.
1334680	1335680	It's a good multiplayer game.
1335680	1336680	It's like Call of Duty 3.
1336680	1339960	I've been playing Call of Duty 3, and that's okay.
1339960	1342960	I mean, there's a few things that...
1342960	1347800	I don't understand why they're making sequels, why they don't just improve on the original
1347800	1348800	one.
1348800	1352880	They always have to take content out, and it's really obvious stuff that should be in
1352880	1357040	there, like I don't know, a radar or something when the gunfire is going off.
1357040	1361240	You can see where the person is on the map, flash where they're at.
1361240	1366280	That was perfect for Call of Duty 2, so you had to be quiet, but now you can just fire
1366280	1368520	away and no one knows where the hell you are.
1368520	1371120	I don't know.
1371120	1372520	I haven't really played that series.
1372520	1373520	Couldn't tell you.
1373520	1374520	Couldn't tell you.
1374520	1378760	Well, you know, Loki messed up there and was talking about EA, but maybe it was a bit of
1378760	1384040	a slip because the next story is about EA, and that's right.
1384040	1388440	You know how EA is famous for putting out things on Marketplace that basically just
1388440	1391520	unlocks things you could get in the game anyway.
1391520	1399680	Well, Need for Speed Carbon has gotten their list on Xbox Live now of some various custom
1399680	1406040	car packages, an aftermarket hoods bundle and spoilers bundle and roof scoops and a
1406040	1411600	87 Toyota Corolla that you can now purchase for various amounts of points, and this is
1411600	1414560	just all crap that you can basically unlock in the game if you're patient, at least most
1414560	1416040	of this I believe.
1416040	1420760	I think some of the cars are exclusive to that.
1420760	1425560	I think maybe the 87 Corolla, but most of that other stuff you can get in the game if
1425560	1426560	you're just patient.
1426560	1427560	Exactly.
1427560	1428560	So, whatever.
1428560	1434080	Well, other news about EA, and this was kind of cool because I like Burnout.
1434080	1435180	Burnout's awesome.
1435180	1441700	They're doing a special Burnout game for the PS2 and PlayStation Portable, Burnout Dominator,
1441700	1445520	and from what I've gathered from the press release so far is it's going to be similar
1445520	1448800	to the Burnout Legends game on the PSP.
1448800	1454520	Kind of a culmination of the entire series so far, featuring all the tracks from one
1454520	1463280	all the way through three and probably also Burnout 4 or Revenge.
1463280	1468120	Looks cool, kind of a good way to end the series on the PlayStation 2.
1468120	1471680	Maybe there might be another PSP version, assuming this one does okay.
1471680	1477680	But Burnout 5 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and the 360, so that will be
1477680	1479080	kind of fun to look forward to.
1479080	1482480	Hopefully they have one for the Wii because that would be kind of cool too.
1482480	1483480	Burnout on the Wii?
1483480	1484480	I don't know.
1484480	1485480	They have Excite Truck on the Wii.
1485480	1486480	Yeah, I guess.
1486480	1487480	I don't know.
1487480	1488480	It would be a little weird.
1488480	1490520	I actually, one game, I don't think I mentioned this during my gaming week, but I have been
1490520	1493880	playing Burnout on the 360 quite a bit this week for no particular reason.
1493880	1499040	I just wanted to play more Burnout and have custom soundtracks and all that fun stuff.
1499040	1504680	And I also really suck at Burnout, so I don't just suck at Halo, I suck at Burnout too.
1504680	1506360	Good times.
1506360	1509560	I will definitely check out the next Burnout on 360 though.
1509560	1512140	It will be fun.
1512140	1516480	Something else I might have to check out at some point, there's a new magazine that is
1516480	1517560	being made.
1517560	1520960	It's called, get this, Wii 60 Magazine.
1520960	1526380	Somebody took this whole concept about getting a Wii and getting a 360 and they have decided
1526380	1531760	to run with it and they're creating a magazine called Wii 60.
1531760	1535800	It's being called an underground movement birthed by the most noble of players during
1535800	1538280	the E3 2006 conference.
1538280	1543000	They're calling it the unadulterated voice of truth in this generation of gaming.
1543000	1546920	These men of valor are some of the most important people in the video game industry and their
1546920	1550520	voice must be heard not just from coast to coast but from pole to pole.
1550520	1552400	What the, who writes this crap?
1552400	1556120	Probably the same people that are going to be writing this magazine and to be honest
1556120	1559520	it's probably going to suck.
1559520	1561360	These people really love themselves.
1561360	1568040	Well anyway you can check out www.Wii60.com to get more information on the magazine if
1568040	1571600	you are curious about this and want to check it out.
1571600	1577480	Now what's interesting is that there is a Wii60.com but the link here leads to Wii60.tv
1577480	1578800	so I'm not sure what that's all about.
1578800	1579800	Maybe there's two sites.
1579800	1580800	Not sure.
1580800	1583080	Maybe you should type it in and look.
1583080	1584080	I'm looking.
1584080	1585080	I'm looking.
1585080	1588320	No it looks like Wii60.tv looks like the real site.
1588320	1589320	Oh get this.
1589320	1598120	The publisher's name is Martin Lokey Alessi and his email address is lokey at Wii60.tv.
1598120	1605040	Here's another magazine that will be stealing from you Lokey.
1605040	1610760	Blaze in our chat room says, hi I write for the magazine Wii60 and I fucking rule heart.
1610760	1613400	James Patrick calls this the hate on Sony magazine.
1613400	1619160	Those comments from me come from our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1619160	1625440	Anyways speaking of the Wii, Sony and Microsoft may have a Wii dilemma.
1625440	1628120	Haha I get it.
1628120	1637100	If you know basically this what Jack Uldrich from Motley Fool if what he says is correct.
1637100	1639000	Basically it makes sense.
1639000	1641540	This is kind of what they're targeting towards.
1641540	1646380	Since the Wii is kind of aiming at that you know casual gamer, non-gamer, people that
1646380	1651760	haven't picked up a video game system yet market, they may be able to actually grow
1651760	1657520	the games market and basically instead of just trying to target the same people that
1657520	1663040	have you know say a Playstation 2 or Xbox or GameCube, they can actually get a bunch
1663040	1669480	of new gamers with the Wii and if that's the case, the 360 and the Playstation 3 might
1669480	1673880	not be able to have the same poll with their systems because they're kind of too I guess
1673880	1680160	hardcore and probably more expensive which case they could actually end up you know coming
1680160	1684800	ahead of everybody else because that was also the same thing before during E3 where the
1684800	1686360	Wii was going to be everyone's second system.
1686360	1689900	Well if it's everyone's second system then of course it's going to be the system that's
1689900	1690900	sold the most.
1690900	1692240	I don't know.
1692240	1693720	I think it's interesting.
1693720	1694720	It makes sense.
1694720	1699480	Uldrich is basically quoted as saying unfortunately because most of the time and energy for the
1699480	1703920	past year has been focused on providing more horsepower and fancier graphics for existing
1703920	1708960	customers the hardcore gamers demand the upgrades found in the Playstation 3.
1708960	1713680	Sony has not busied themselves in developing products that appeal to non-gamers.
1713680	1718160	As a result, it appears that they are now behind the curve in development of simpler
1718160	1722720	to use and less expensive technologies like the Wii and it makes sense.
1722720	1727480	I mean the Playstation 3 is that's a lot of money to drop on a system that you might not
1727480	1733040	be sure you know about and whereas the Wii I think it's pretty much pick up and go type
1733040	1737760	of thing especially since it comes with its own new game already.
1737760	1739160	Hmm.
1739160	1742560	Interesting I mean so you kind of agree with what's going on here with this story?
1742560	1749040	I think so but then again the 360 I think you know with Sony though I don't rule out
1749040	1752080	that they're not going to try to copy more stuff that the Wii is doing.
1752080	1758200	I mean I think there is already some patents registered for more devices like the Wiimote.
1758200	1763560	I wouldn't be surprised if they try to copy everything that you know the Wii is doing.
1763560	1766360	Even if they did copy it though do you think it would work?
1766360	1772400	I don't think so because even still so you already have some games that appeal to a casual
1772400	1773400	gamer.
1773400	1777600	Well a casual gamer is not going to drop $600 for your system.
1777600	1778600	That's true.
1778600	1782000	Also I kind of think about you know I don't know I think about the Wii and I think about
1782000	1788880	all those real big brand names that Nintendo has and big franchises like Metroid and Smash
1788880	1794120	Brothers and Mario and Zelda and you know you get my point but then on Sony I think
1794120	1800000	about franchises and I don't know they don't have that same I can't picture them in that
1800000	1804660	well there's not a lot of franchises in Sony that Sony really owns I mean they're all third
1804660	1806080	party franchises really.
1806080	1810160	That's the thing is when you think about Nintendo you think okay Mario, Zelda, and you know
1810160	1817120	Metroid when you think about Microsoft and 360 you think Halo and well that's pretty
1817120	1823480	much it Halo but still when you think of Sony you kind of have trouble thinking of an actual
1823480	1828000	franchise you know that's exclusive to them maybe you know Gran Turismo and God of War
1828000	1834040	but they don't really have any like mascots or any you know games that really people buy
1834040	1835040	the system for.
1835040	1839800	I mean I guess in the middle of your solid four but I mean the air talking now that's
1839800	1846040	going to be on both systems so really they're just Final Fantasy 13 question mark?
1846040	1851000	You know if let me put it this way if Final Fantasy 13 for the Playstation 3 okay if it
1851000	1858280	ends up that the Xbox 360 is sold tens of millions more systems than say the Playstation
1858280	1862320	3 at the time the game is coming out I will bet you anything that they will be putting
1862320	1869120	out on the Xbox 360 as well as the Playstation 3 if not only on the Xbox 360.
1869120	1873080	Footy Monster in our chat room responded to something I said earlier saying Sky but on
1873080	1876160	the other hand Nintendo has no third party so far.
1876160	1881200	Well yes and no I mean the third party they don't have any like really huge third party
1881200	1886160	franchises the way that maybe some of the other consoles do but third parties do seem
1886160	1891000	to be sort of rallying around the Wii a little bit I mean they want to put out some of their
1891000	1895160	franchises on there like and it has gotten support at least at their launch I mean Red
1895160	1898720	Steel was a big title even though it was a critical hit and miss.
1898720	1903200	Trauma Center was a great game even though it wasn't really widely picked up on but it
1903200	1908160	was a little more critically aware so Elibits is looking to be a big title that's made by
1908160	1915760	Konami so you know I think some of the mistakes made with GameCube in regards to third party
1915760	1921760	are definitely already on their way to being remedied with the Wii.
1921760	1925000	The more Wii's that get out there the more third parties that will want to develop for
1925000	1926000	it.
1926000	1928720	And here's the other thing too I mean Squaresoft I mean I know that they're really dedicated
1928720	1933880	to Sony but I mean at some point they're going to have to understand okay this system you
1933880	1938520	know let's say a year from now when Final Fantasy 13 is coming out say that they're
1938520	1943160	not able to sell as many systems as they would have liked for the PlayStation 3 so they're
1943160	1946720	behind by say 10 million systems.
1946720	1951280	Why would I develop for a system that has less units out there less of a chance for
1951280	1955400	me to make my money back when there's a system that's cheaper to develop for and has a lot
1955400	1961240	more systems out there and is capable of doing comparable graphics?
1961240	1966440	I don't understand why that would be pure idiocy to just develop for the one system
1966440	1973120	that's why you have companies like you know Koei developing Fatal Inertia and their Blade
1973120	1977940	Storm game for both systems now because to be honest they're not going to make their
1977940	1982360	money back if they just put it out on the PlayStation 3 and that's a big problem for
1982360	1983360	Sony.
1983360	1987120	They've got to figure out how to get these systems sold first off getting the systems
1987120	1992080	out there and give people a reason to buy this system because right now it's just seeing
1992080	1995640	that it has a blu-ray player well you know what a lot of people say who gives a shit
1995640	1999880	about blu-ray player I don't care right now because I'm not going to go replace my entire
1999880	2002760	DVD library.
2002760	2006200	Interesting thoughts if you agree or disagree send us an email because we'll get to the
2006200	2011140	emails a little later in the program mailbag at orangesloungeradio.com meanwhile we got
2011140	2016760	to keep going through the news and speaking of Nintendo Wii very interesting I don't know
2016760	2020900	if this would be news or rumor the thing is that it's coming from a foreign website and
2020900	2024640	not to discount what foreign websites might be saying but you know we kind of get a little
2024640	2028760	bit until we see like a you know press release from Nintendo of America we're not really
2028760	2034820	sure what to think of this but according to this website cyamite.de they were reporting
2034820	2038840	that you're going to be able to download Wii game demos you can either store the demos
2038840	2044480	in your flash ram on the console or to an external SD card now what's kind of interesting
2044480	2049120	about this is that well the Wii doesn't have exactly that much internal memory I mean it's
2049120	2052960	got what about 512 megs yep and by the time you start downloading all this other stuff
2052960	2056600	that Nintendo's planning to put out like the internet channel you know things of that nature
2056600	2059680	that stuff's going to start to fill up especially with some of the other big virtual console
2059680	2064940	releases so you know where are these demos going to go I guess there's the SD card but
2064940	2070180	still it seems a little not quite I don't know well one thing to keep reading and they're
2070180	2077200	saying that there's support for USB hard drives and USB devices coming but you have to have
2077200	2082380	the latest update to be able to store stuff to it the only thing is though is this update
2082380	2087160	I think people are talking about isn't out yet and from what the rumors I've been reading
2087160	2093240	are that an update with the internet channel is going to support USB hard drives as well
2093240	2096960	if that's the case then they can store them to that and I'm sure you'll see a Nintendo
2096960	2103320	hard drive of some sort that'll plug in via the USB ports on there I don't know that looks
2103320	2108240	sounds like a little after the fact I mean I really wish they would have put more storage
2108240	2112840	in the system but that's a little bit disappointing I would have thought they would have put more
2112840	2116200	storage inside the actual system itself but I mean I guess you know they want to keep
2116200	2120600	it cheap so it makes sense okay that's fine if you want to keep it cheap fine build a
2120600	2125960	port for a hard drive then well it's not what the SD card slots for really cuz you can fit
2125960	2131200	quite a bit on those little cards I mean and they were good enough to that you can put
2131200	2135720	any SD card in there in fact you know most people are saying screw these official Nintendo
2135720	2141080	SD cards I'm gonna go buy I'm gonna go buy the cheaper ones and use those I've been using
2141080	2145680	the card for my camera phone to send pictures if I was digging through the my phone the
2145680	2150780	other day and I saw a picture of you at E3 outpost it's really funny cuz you're like
2150780	2155200	leaning over the couch and going rawr but you can see Bobby Blackwolf in the background
2155200	2159800	like doing some busy work so I send it to Bobby and I drew like a big arrow in the in
2159800	2165440	the paint channel I put who dat or something like that so I've been having fun with the
2165440	2171640	camera phone converter thing SD card and I put I put Zelda on it just for fun even though
2171640	2177800	I know I can't play it on other Wii's just for fun I'm gonna say I got Zelda in my pocket
2177800	2183120	cuz I'm lame like that anyways so there is another story that came out very vague this
2183120	2189400	week was coming from a magazine called games TM and oh wait I gotta say that this is a
2189400	2194520	very good point James Patrick is saying 360 has no hard drive in its core bundle true
2194520	2200760	that's a good point but they had a port for one though true okay you got that and it does
2200760	2205680	have some internal memory but not that you can save games on really it's just for you
2205680	2213840	know updates and things like that yeah anyways so yeah there is a very vague comment from
2213840	2222240	the magazine says something big coming to Wii Virtual Console and how big is it well
2222240	2226640	it doesn't say what hell am I reporting is this news I know what what the fuck kind of
2226640	2236960	news there is something something big is on its way well you know better be some damn
2236960	2242080	you know Reggie fees amaze about to make a big duty that you can download on your virtual
2242080	2248960	console this Monday I want my fucking Nintendo games TurboGrafx-16 is great and all but uh
2248960	2255320	give me more Nintendo games you know what the hell where's my kid Icarus where's my
2255320	2262320	guardian legend where's my super Castlevania 4 which they have overseas where's my link
2262320	2267280	to the past which they have overseas damn you people where's my Super Mario Brothers
2267280	2276520	Super Mario World Mario Kart Mario Kart 64 damn you Reggie anyways well you know this
2276520	2280960	might be enough to sway you back into a like in the TurboGrafx-16 downloads there are some
2280960	2287580	rumors abounding that Alien Crush which was a pretty badass TurboGrafx-16 game and Dungeon
2287580	2292040	Explorer on their way to the Wii's Virtual Console now the story here is kind of vague
2292040	2296400	you're not sure if they mean it's coming out this week or that it's coming out in the future
2296400	2301660	so I'm thinking it means it's coming out soon so whether that means this week or the future
2301660	2307580	I mean we just did kind of get a big clump of TurboGrafx-16 games supposed to be every
2307580	2311760	Monday yeah but but do we have to be getting TurboGrafx and Genesis every Monday I mean
2311760	2316960	don't get me wrong there's some good games there but there's things I want more on the
2316960	2322320	NES and if somebody in chat was saying Gunstar Heroes is rumored for this Monday I imagine
2322320	2326600	the four games we're gonna get probably are just gonna be games that are available elsewhere
2326600	2331760	but who knows which ones I tried using my credit card to put more points on my Virtual
2331760	2336800	Console account and didn't work really mine works fine yeah mine it I guess their network
2336800	2341620	was having trouble or something but you know plenty of money on there definitely not broke
2341620	2348080	or anything so I don't know stupid stupid virtual console and of course now everybody
2348080	2352020	in the chat room is talking about I want I want I want I want I want let's see we've
2352020	2359320	got act deft I want my Super Mario RPG yeah monster once zombies ate my neighbors shadow
2359320	2364520	Charlie's okay with more Genesis as long as the streets of rage and shadow next-gen agrees
2364520	2368920	the mean link to the past on Virtual Console shadow next-gen also want Super Metroid on
2368920	2374720	VC hell yeah Dark Knight once pilot wings those are all good stuff property once Super
2374720	2380720	C that was a pretty cool game Super C I think is on game tap I think as well with the Contra
2380720	2384720	so you can always check it out there I I want the the Super Nintendo Contra though that
2384720	2388560	wasn't called Super C was it was something else Super Contra right I want that one that
2388560	2393040	was pretty cool because they had like the mode seven levels those are rad yeah anyways
2393040	2401920	so much like you know immersion did with the Sony PlayStation 2 dual shock controller another
2401920	2406800	company has claimed that they want to take Nintendo the court over the Wii remote because
2406800	2413640	they say they have a patent for it and very similar kind of lawsuit company called interlink
2413640	2418920	who has revealed that they have a device that's very similar to the Wii remote that they've
2418920	2423240	patented my guess they probably haven't created said device but you know they have a patent
2423240	2429160	for it anyways and basically you know going to try to get some money out of Nintendo you
2429160	2436440	know different companies same song it sounds like but gotta hate hate when these companies
2436440	2441980	do this stuff because they totally create patents for stuff that they don't imagine
2441980	2447440	on that they're not going to even use just the because they probably hear that some companies
2447440	2453040	make it something similar well what if this did legitimately already exist well it looks
2453040	2458000	like crap anyways it looks like it to be honest looking at this right now it it looks like
2458000	2465880	a TV remote it that's all it looks like it it looks like it has an infrared emitter inside
2465880	2474000	the actual device you know controller I guess and then there is a receiver that you know
2474000	2478920	would be an infrared receiver so if anything I would say that the people that created like
2478920	2486360	a TV remote would be able to sue over the Wii remote because I don't know this I think
2486360	2491400	there's enough different with the two devices that they probably won't well now it says
2491400	2495520	here that in the come I'm reading through the complaint here and this patent was filed
2495520	2499760	by the other company on February 1st 2005 long before anyone knew anything about the
2499760	2508520	Wii so true though okay so it was filed 2005 doesn't mean though that they weren't you
2508520	2514400	know that I'd want to see when the patent was filed for the Wii remote because apparently
2514400	2522360	the Wii has been in production for a long time I don't know oh I see it's it's you use
2522360	2525920	it in operating the computer from far away they use it between it's they made it for
2525920	2530720	the computer it's probably to it's like one of our point yeah it's one of the yeah it's
2530720	2533840	one of those things I'll let you run like the PowerPoint shows from a room from I have
2533840	2539060	I want to work that's just saying like that a TV remote though basically I mean that's
2539060	2546240	basically what it is interesting I mean isn't that what a TV remote is I mean or D like
2546240	2550480	a DVD remote for example you know that would be basically what it is because you know I
2550480	2558360	use the PlayStation 2 DVD remote to navigate menus and stuff it's very similar to this
2558360	2564720	it uses IR as well I just think that they're too different I mean this is very similar
2564720	2570800	to say a TV remote than it is you know the Wii remote Raven's Dolphin says the Wii trigger
2570800	2579140	goes through Bluetooth not infrared they will lose exactly hmm well you know these lawsuits
2579140	2583200	that seemingly come out of nowhere when something gets popular they make us angsty and we get
2583200	2588000	really angry about this stuff because we don't want anyone taking away our we so that means
2588000	2598920	it's about time for the F use of the week
2598920	2603920	since dark soccer is not here tonight Loki you're gonna have to start us off if you to
2603920	2613600	dark soccer for not being here yeah if you to the ferret I want to say f you to rpm racing
2613600	2619200	because they're number 11 car had fucked up traction on it so I kept slamming into the
2619200	2627920	wall and I actually had to get pitted one lap because they black flagged me fuck you
2627920	2638760	to rob for the fact that you know pretty good music I like this let's see I would have to
2638760	2645480	say gosh I don't have a lot to be angsty about today I would say an F you to the rain and
2645480	2649360	it being so cold out recently an F you to the fact that I'm spoiled by California weather
2649360	2654600	so what's what's cold right now probably isn't really cold to other people so if you to the
2654600	2661280	weather lately has been kind of crappy that's it left the room because he has a bad headache
2661280	2666000	I guess DER gave him a headache so maybe it's not here to put in his F you so F you to headaches
2666000	2676480	and Advil it doesn't work anyhow let's go into our next story which is about the spike
2676480	2684520	TV VGA's if I'm not mistaking did you these have an air jet have they I think they're
2684520	2697360	going to air it taped on Friday but it's going to air on what the 13th probably spoiler alert
2697360	2701600	we're going to ruin it for you right now here's who won at the spike TV game of the year was
2701600	2708440	Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion best individual sports game was Tony Hawk Project 8 best team
2708440	2715200	sports game was NBA 2K7 best song was Lights and Sounds by Yellow Card and Burnout Revenge

2797320	2803160	guys who do Mega64.com it was really cool you know I met them at an E3 a couple years
2803160	2807080	ago and they seemed really offended I didn't know who they were I mean I know who they
2807080	2810820	are now but at the time they seemed really offended that I didn't know who they were
2810820	2815600	I'm like sorry but somebody explained it to me afterwards I'm like oh that Tetris video
2815600	2821120	yeah that's that's kind of funny so anyway were they cool to you they seemed pretty cool
2821120	2826380	yeah they were they were pretty pretty nice to me how about how about any A-list celebrities
2826380	2831800	because you know Mega64 with all due respect it's kind of like D, E-list, internet celebrities
2831800	2836440	where do internet celebrities go on the E-list somewhere where did you meet did you meet
2836440	2844040	Samuel L. Jackson or Tom Cruise I don't know the A-list celebrities I'm sorry to hear that
2844040	2848720	so why is your voice so hoarse were you screaming and yelling and cheering at all these people
2848720	2855240	yes I was I was more booing at them than than anything so you were booing all the celebrities
2855240	2862200	as they came out on stage yeah as Ravenstaufen1 says in chat I did boo 50 Cent when he came
2862200	2869000	to present an award what'd you say to 50 Cent I said your game sucks well I mean it does
2869000	2874600	I mean did did did anybody yell back or could people actually hear you or was it the place
2874600	2880280	so huge they couldn't really hear you I I think some people know the first floor heard
2880280	2887700	me and they they laughed so so you you were the heckler guy huh yes I was I'm reading
2887700	2892360	a little bit of back and forth that's going on on destructoid.com because you made a comment
2892360	2895680	you were talking about in their in their comments you're talking about you know how you yelled
2895680	2902240	at 50 Cent your game sucks and his game didn't suck let's see DJ Tyrant wrote booing yellow
2902240	2909960	cards saying get off the stage asshole and yelled at Sarah Silverman you're not funny
2909960	2913680	see I think this stuff is kind of funny but then somebody replied to you dude you were
2913680	2918460	a total ass I sat three rows behind you you were wearing a blue X-Fire shirt you were
2918460	2925000	a huge asshole throughout the show comments were you a big asshole throughout the show
2925000	2932480	yes I was I'll admit that I don't see how anyone can take it seriously though the show
2932480	2937240	it's terrible you know what I think it's funny because you're right all these celebrities
2937240	2941680	are just coming out how many of them do you think actually play games how much of 50 cents
2941680	2946640	game do you think he actually played I think these celebrities just show up to these events
2946640	2949400	because they know it's something they can add to their resume and say that they were
2949400	2958200	on TV right yeah definitely although the guy who was Superman Superman Returns I can't
2958200	2965400	think of his name Brandon Routh he's a he was obviously a big Warcraft fan when he introduced
2965400	2971960	the World of Warcraft Burning Crusade video why did he come out there and go Leroy Jenkins
2971960	2978640	he do that nobody he said he he had played Warcraft 2 and mentioned a lot about how he
2978640	2986600	liked wizard so so you didn't see at least one gamer out there so you didn't boo him
2986600	2992080	no okay so somebody if somebody earned their cred with DJ Tyrant then they didn't get booed
2992080	2997160	all right yeah I cheered for Gears of War I haven't played it but they definitely deserve
2997160	3002360	the respect it's a good game if you're into first-person shooters it's a good game all
3002360	3007640	right well anything else you want to say about the award show watch it and see if you can
3007640	3012440	hear me during it no they'll they'll they'll have muted you or bleeped you out that's that's
3012440	3016360	why they don't air it live because they're too they're too chicken shit to air it live
3016360	3020800	because these these celebrities egos would be damaged if heaven forbid they could pick
3020800	3028640	up in the background some a-hole in the bleachers no offense going your game sucks so they're
3028640	3033540	they're they're doing that post editing right now bleeping you out and probably blurring
3033540	3038000	your seat they'll work hard what well I made them work hard there you go that's all that
3038000	3042200	matters all right well yeah and black wolf in our chat room says the crowd noise will
3042200	3047520	be faked the entire show most likely was there a lot of thunderous applause did they have
3047520	3054000	the lights that say applause applause or did they bring a girl on stage they had a lot
3054000	3061240	of seat fillers though a lot of seat fillers oh like the people they pay to go fill in
3061240	3065400	the celebrity seats when they go to the bathroom yeah they were they were all in the front
3065400	3070720	row it seemed like interesting huh all right well thank you for the insider perspective
3070720	3074760	and hey try to go to some more awards so say hey if they do a G4ia this year you definitely
3074760	3078840	have to get in there and do some heckling all right I'll see what I can do all right

3103560	3109600	guys all right that was our very own DJ Tyrant giving us the the scoop on what went on at
3109600	3115120	the video game awards and how he was a big jerk but you know what it's you know you can't
3115120	3118880	take celebrities seriously like if Britney Spears had come out I would have yelled you
3118880	3122800	know where's your panties you know because you know because of all the pictures recently
3122800	3131160	anyway forget it anywho back to some news um you know I'm starting to think we should
3131160	3141480	really curb from now on any stories that are from an analyst I mean seriously the rumors
3141480	3146640	come back up again from an analyst saying that Apple is entering the console market
3146640	3153440	and their take on it is basically we think that the video game market represents a distinct
3153440	3157480	possibility for Apple especially considering that it recently announced that the availability
3157480	3164440	of video games for its iPod through the iTunes store that's not a reason that's stupid that's
3164440	3169280	like I don't get it every fucking week on this program for the past almost five years
3169280	3174280	what do we sit here and do we sit here and analyze the game scene that's what we do and
3174280	3180520	nobody's ever thrown money at us I don't get it these finance if I got a degree would they
3180520	3185280	throw money at us in in whatever these people have degree in marketing analysis or whatever
3185280	3189120	and they don't even have to be right they're like the goddamn weatherman of you know the
3189120	3195200	fucking video game industry or whatever industry they're having to be reporting on oh I think
3195200	3201660	that you know squirrels are gonna fly on my ass today and if it doesn't happen who cares
3201660	3206600	because I'm an analyst and if I'm wrong well that's because the company's changed their
3206600	3211120	mind I mean it doesn't matter here's what Apple is gonna create next they're gonna create
3211120	3216120	their own line of sex toys you're gonna have the eye the Apple like I vibe or something
3216120	3222800	like that I mean seriously that is my analyst take on this because people like having fun
3222800	3227820	therefore they like being pleasured there you go you know have feel the bass through
3227820	3234440	the I vibe FireBoma calls it the eye-braider eye-braider whatever you know seriously this
3234440	3239880	is how ridiculous these stories are I for one I will not be putting talking about any
3239880	3244880	analyst crap from now on okay do you think it's feasible though that Apple could do a
3244880	3249800	console it's feasible that they could do a console I mean after all they're doing here's
3249800	3254340	what I think they would do if anything their ITV supporting some casual games and that's
3254340	3259220	about it I'd say I agree with that exactly I think that little you know much like video
3259220	3263540	games consoles in this generation 360 and the PlayStation 3 have been a Trojan horse
3263540	3268200	in the living room to do movies and TV and all that stuff I think Apple's gonna do that
3268200	3272080	in reverse I think they're gonna have put this Trojan horse in as a movie device and
3272080	3277120	then hey it'll play Zuma and Bejeweled too that's it that's it's not gonna be able to
3277120	3282960	run much anything else and have you tried playing any of these games on the Apple iPod
3282960	3290520	they suck so I mean seriously and you know I hate I hate to sound like the fucking Apple
3290520	3297360	hater but the Apple I mean their line of computers not exactly the biggest gaming machines I
3297360	3302600	don't think they know how to make gaming machines if they even really want I I you know I will
3302600	3309340	admit I love my now I love my Mac I love my little Mac laptop it's it's great I consider
3309340	3313760	myself bi when it comes to computers I like Apple sometimes I like you know PC's other
3313760	3319480	days but I don't exactly when I think hey I'm gonna go play some games on the computer
3319480	3323480	I don't exactly think about my Apple and there's nothing wrong with that I mean they could
3323480	3328040	they could come out with a game console I just I don't I think it's too late in the
3328040	3333920	game to come out with a new console right now and I think if they did it it would fail
3333920	3339260	it would be like you know the Phantom or something like that the Pippin Black Wolf says
3339260	3345240	apparently Tetris works really well on an iPod I I don't know I don't read but my iPod
3345240	3350360	was the old ass black and white one and it broke so I'm hoping I get gift certificates
3350360	3355120	this Christmas so I can get myself a new one but great then I can tell you blue ass though
3355120	3361120	and that's the thing I mean so great one and at the end of the day it's bejeweled again
3361120	3366400	I mean you know you can't take this seriously as a console unless there's new things to
3366400	3370880	breathe life and anything you know what I will admit there was one time you know with
3370880	3375400	Apple II that they had good games on there I mean you know you had some pretty good stuff
3375400	3386280	on the Apple II but uh that that day is long past so well if you agree or you disagree
3386280	3390380	again the mailbag is always open I'm trying to see if the chat rooms had anything to say
3390380	3394080	about that but a lot of them are talking about trying to find those Britney Spears pictures
3394080	3399320	again because I guess not everybody heard about it uh Loki why don't you take the next
3399320	3407120	story too anyways so there was a game that's been announced here um which I mean I know
3407120	3412640	that we're slightly a you know fan of the show uh Little Britain it's a show that's
3412640	3418760	run in um the UK and also on BBC America yeah it's on BBC America um it's as very these
3418760	3424000	do very well it's actually a parody of life in in Britain and they've got a bunch of different
3424000	3431240	characters in there almost reminds me a little bit of like um kind of a modern take on say
3431240	3435320	Monty Python everybody's got kids in the hall kind of yeah kind of kids with two people
3435320	3439800	but um it yeah it's basically these two guys and it's hilarious it's a funny show well
3439800	3444280	they're ba- making a brand new PlayStation 2 game based off of it and it's gonna be a
3444280	3450440	collection of a bunch of mini games and it's just it's pretty funny looking from what I've
3450440	3453440	seen so far what the hell are you gonna do with the Little Britain game don't be wrong
3453440	3457800	I love the show but I can't really picture it as a game I mean are you gonna go around
3457800	3462920	yelling I am the only game in the village no I that was funny that you mentioned that
3462920	3468080	because actually they that was one of the the advertisements on the um the story they
3468080	3474360	said you know I am the only game in the village no there's actually one though um one scene
3474360	3480920	that I saw where you're riding around um trying to basically scare away the other gays that
3480920	3485240	are in the village so that you can become the only game in the village you know just
3485240	3489800	it's it's funny it's basically gonna be a collection of is there like is there gonna
3489800	3493960	be like a music game for rap for the one girl that goes no but yeah but yeah but yeah but
3493960	3498400	yeah and I you know her that tells all the the stories and stuff um basically anyways
3498400	3503160	so the game is going to be like I said a collection of mini games presented in a format of an
3503160	3508400	episode of the TV show and since players can enter um can get interactive with their favorite
3508400	3513960	sketch show characters um in the series of eight mini games featuring Lou and Andy, Vicki
3513960	3523360	Pollard, which you know no but yeah, uh Mr. Man, uh Emily and Florence, we got a lady!
3523360	3530800	Majorie Dawes, um Daphne Thomas, uh Judy and Maggie and Letty and says each mini game plays
3530800	3534800	like a sketch from the TV show to win the game players must progress through all the
3534800	3540680	sketches to the end of the show or the credits will roll and um I don't know they have and
3540680	3542120	that's coming out here in America too?
3542120	3546560	I don't think so I think it's only in the UK and it's coming out on PC because you won't
3546560	3551320	even be able to import that oh if it's PC you can PC PlayStation Portable you can get
3551320	3557600	the PlayStation Portable version and um PlayStation 2 the PlayStation 2 and PC versions will be
3557600	3564880	out January 22nd um and then May for the PSP version so we can import the you know the
3564880	3569400	PSP one which might be fun is what's-his-name from Buffy in it and Anthony Stewart Head
3569400	3574120	is that his name is he in it um I'm not sure but like they've got you know examples here
3574120	3578480	oh here's a screenshot you know really great radio here but it's one of the mini games
3578480	3585480	where you're smashing objects okay so I I don't know smashing frogs it looks like so
3585480	3594800	I don't know it'll it'll be funny but interesting I'm sure it will be a good game anywho so
3594800	3601120	um kind of moving on to a completely different topic here the Xbox 360 well we know that
3601120	3608680	it has an HD DVD drive well guess what it's gonna be people are using it to copy HD DVDs
3608680	3615800	to rip them to their PC because the HD DVD drive uses a USB port and a connection or
3615800	3623040	USB connection and can be um you know you can do the 1080p connection over component
3623040	3629760	cables you can actually use a video capture card to capture that and then dump it of course
3629760	3636880	to your hard drive for backup purposes only of course um of course you know the PlayStation
3636880	3643840	3 I think does the same thing with blu-ray I mean I don't know but later on um I suppose
3643840	3648320	when they're gonna require the HDMI cables that might be able to circumvent some of the
3648320	3654440	stuff but right now you can dump them via that I don't know oh I'm sure this has the
3654440	3659280	movie industry so excited whatever I mean it's their own fault that they couldn't figure
3659280	3664760	out a way they encrypted I still don't know what movies I really want on HD DVD I guess
3664760	3668160	I'm still waiting for the format to kind of take off that's the thing too like there was
3668160	3673320	a movie that I wanted but it's only on blu-ray interesting annoying you know that you're
3673320	3679800	gonna get a PlayStation 3 eventually right maybe I mean I don't know probably interesting
3679800	3683560	I got I got berated by the wife because she's like I thought you said you weren't gonna
3683560	3688800	get one of those I'm like what you just got excited about the you know motorstorm games
3688800	3695200	so all right well moving on to some ads that were about the PlayStation 3 they were run
3695200	3699840	by Circuit City and a joystick picked up some of these Circuit City ads running it under
3699840	3704400	the headline circuit city faults or stupid advertising you decide that's again on joystick
3704400	3709480	with a q.com which is interesting because they talk about some things from the catalog
3709480	3714860	and how it said PlayStation 3 ready to rumble it's hot and of course you know the joke would
3714860	3720480	be that the PlayStation 3 does not in fact rumble and it has been overheating yeah and
3720480	3726520	so using the word hot is kind of funny as well and also I guess they show people playing
3726520	3731920	Xbox 360 Madden yet the controllers are off you know because you know Holly even when
3731920	3735920	even if you have a wired controller the Xbox guide button glows green with what you know
3735920	3740880	player you're in well of course in the picture you know obviously it's posed I mean they're
3740880	3745020	not really playing the game this isn't too hard to figure out but of course the anal
3745020	3749680	gamer will notice that the lights are off and so in fact the controllers are not plugged
3749680	3756680	in did you see the one of the we though on there no I did I missed that one there's a
3756680	3764400	picture with the Wii saying that the Wii can be played without a TV because it has a built
3764400	3772280	in projector into it what I'm serious I am wasn't that one of the old rumors about the
3772280	3780480	was one of the old rumors but if that's how like somebody did not get the memo it's really
3780480	3789640	bad but I how does this like get through I mean seriously how does this get by without
3789640	3796120	people you know noticing this stuff so seriously because there's no gamers that work at circuit
3796120	3801040	cities proofreading department no here it is right here it's it's actually take a look
3801040	3807560	at the the story again it says the USB port lets you plug in the game system to a project
3807560	3814240	and play or to project and play on awesome eleven and a half foot widescreen and that
3814240	3821960	was for the Wii that might actually be for the 360 whatever it's still wrong it doesn't
3821960	3829160	matter the turned off Xbox 360 controllers playing Madden on a projection television
3829160	3837920	supposedly attached to the Xbox 360 by a USB cable interesting whatever it's just obviously
3837920	3843220	all that stuff supposed you know people read a little bit too much into that stuff well
3843220	3850200	you may not be able to actually you know have a projector built into your Xbox 360 or we
3850200	3857620	but you can make your own power glove and that's what someone's done actually they have
3857620	3864720	modified a power glove to put a black we remote on it and they've captured the hearts of geeks
3864720	3871000	everywhere for about five minutes until the next video comes out with something else even
3871000	3877800	more shiny I don't know it's stupid but I'm sure someone was going to do it at some point
3877800	3885800	and I'm sure someone has commented on this video it's so bad let me see how many posts
3885800	3895840	it took to say it's so bad you know I am actually surprised oh oh oh eight posts eight posts
3895840	3901720	all right there you go speaking of things that are so bad this is this is so so bad
3901720	3907840	it's good I mean like so awesome you know bad meaning good get this the DS Lite has
3907840	3912560	some new decals being made for it you can turn your DS Lite you know you can use the
3912560	3918840	decals to change your DS Lite and they're being sold by Sanrio that's right you can
3918840	3925520	make your DS Lite the Hello Kitty DS Lite oh how fun is that going to be for the low
3925520	3932840	low price of 680 yen that's about five dollars and ninety cents you can get this from Sanrio
3932840	3937880	so awesome and they look best by the way on the pink DS's just so you know goodie just
3937880	3942840	more reason for me to get a pink DS Lite this Christmas well those pink lights are going
3942840	3946720	for a lot of money actually on eBay from what I've been hearing really of course my customers
3946720	3951680	are still in stock in most places no eBay people are selling out of them quick interesting
3951680	3959880	anyways apparently Canada is bleeding up your DS stylus future shop you can actually purchase
3959880	3970900	a 18 karat gold stylus for the low low price of $19.99 and wow Neil that would really suck
3970900	3977760	if you lost that one because is that like one of the fat ones or the light light so
3977760	3981800	then it's like one of the fat pens because the DS Lite actually had a fatter pen and
3981800	3988120	my guess is probably it's gold plated it'd be funny if this is gold painted well it might
3988120	3995700	be painted in the 14 karat gold or whatever it is I don't know all right well something
3995700	3999440	else I'm sure people are going to be paying a lot of money for depends if they decide
3999440	4004960	to charge this for this or not but there is a huge rabid fan base around the television
4004960	4009080	show that used to be on the air called Firefly and you might remember they made it into a
4009080	4013880	movie as well called serenity I didn't really follow the TV show but extra firm you know
4013880	4019200	my roommate is a huge Whedon whore you know Buffy and angel and all that so I got dragged
4019200	4023000	to see serenity the day it opened it wasn't bad I was right it was pretty good I didn't
4023000	4027640	fall if I did get an HD DVD player I would buy serenity serenity a good movie for HD
4027640	4031520	or any sci-fi movie really would be good well that's not what I'm reporting on what I'm
4031520	4038840	talking about is that this has been licensed for an MMO multiverse has struck a deal with
4038840	4045520	Fox to put the Firefly property into the MMO ring now keep in mind this is very early on
4045520	4051160	there's no development team yet put together like this but they want to do a type of Star
4051160	4057940	Wars galaxy type game but they say they will make it unique and fun and interesting so
4057940	4063280	it probably won't happen till 2008 but that could be very interesting and there's certainly
4063280	4067080	a huge fan base out there that'll at least check this out for curiosity factor alone
4067080	4071640	what'd you think I think so I didn't even check it out even though I don't know much
4071640	4076920	about the series it's like you know space cowboys I mean it's it's definitely unique
4076920	4081200	and who doesn't love cowboys in outer space you gotta love the fact that the show's been
4081200	4086240	canceled you know and the series has been canceled and it's not coming back there's
4086240	4089880	not going to be a sequel to Serenity yeah but isn't that what happened to Star Trek
4089880	4092960	the original Star Trek got canceled pretty early on and then they made a movie and it
4092960	4098520	became huge but then again Serenity unfortunately did not quite have a huge box office success
4098520	4106180	call it Firefly the movie yeah oh well anyway that's our last story for this part A of Orange
