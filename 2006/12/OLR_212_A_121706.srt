00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is your host, DarkSakura, Sky and Mokey!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, December 17th, 2006, Sony fests up to a fake website, a popular roleplaying series jumps to a new system, and are the Wii modes really being Wii called?

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Orange Lounge Radio

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you for the next three hours, as well as my partners in crime.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Say hello to the one and only happy, happy bunny, DarkSakura.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You're doing it differently, Rob.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What do you mean? Oh, I'm doing the opening differently?

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You're doing it differently, Rob.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Am I not allowed to change things once in a while?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Nobody likes anything different.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Remember, people only like happy trance.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We fear change.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Get a corn cob up their ass.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Right.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Say hello as well.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You will be like us.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Here comes another podcast review.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
DarkSakura is too angsty.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
She is so angsty on the show all the time.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But we love her.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We love her. Angstinol. We love her.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I love me too.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And she knows her shit when it comes to video games.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
She really does.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Don't be fooled.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hell yeah.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All right.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Say hello as well to tech master Loki.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There's some weird, like, cord spaghetti going on by your chair there.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's what happens here in the OLR studio.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So, how's your week been, Loki?

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Been pretty good?

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's been okay.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I still haven't played one of the games I bought, but I'm, like, dreading the play because I know it's going to suck.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What's that?

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Far Cry Vengeance for the Wii.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Uh-oh.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It got a horrible review.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It has two-player multiplayer, which I didn't know when I bought it.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I mean, you can't have multiplayer. It's just two players in a first-person shooter game.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You know what? The game reviews have been getting a lot of heat lately.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I mean, you have the Zelda Wii Twilight Princess on the GameCube and, you know, things on, what, GameSpot got, like, an 8.8 and 8.9.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
People are, like, oh, my God.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They don't know what they're talking about.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But everybody's been giving this thing, like, a 4 out of 10, 3 out of 10.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Well, and then Elibits just recently was reviewed in Electronic Gaming Monthly.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was reading on Destructoid something about it, and they were pissed because some people over there gave it 4s.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You know?

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Whatever.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I know.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But I know just from reading what the, you know, just different specifics about it.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No level editing in there.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And apparently the actual gameplay is kind of lame.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The controls suck on it.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And I don't know, but I haven't played it yet, and I heard the graphics suck even more than the Xbox.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So I might just have to sell it back again.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, well.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
All right.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, before we get into too much Game Talk, we have to introduce one of our other very special guests.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Say hello to our woman on the street, but she hasn't done any interviews lately.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We're going to have to change that.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Say hello to Chris.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, would you like me to interview?

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't know.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Maybe when we take a trip, because we're planning a trip for January.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm going to go on one of your Disneyland excursions.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's right.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So we can harass people at Disneyland.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That would be fun.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You know what?

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We were going to do an interview.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We were at Disneyland last time.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We would go to the one arcade that they have inside both parks, and we were going to go,

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you know, say it's like live from the Disneyland arcade.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We have arcade stuff.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Because they don't really have much there, but it's fun.

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We were just going to goof off.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They do have a virtual machine where you get inside and it moves around as you're driving

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
the car.

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So that's pretty interesting.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So there was an arcade version of F-Zero which came out on the GameCube not that long ago.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Right.

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And it was kind of like that where you got in and it would tilt around.

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I loved that game except for the fact there were only six tracks.

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So it got old really quick.

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
My dad was playing that when I was there.

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I played the Japanese one at Arcade Infinity.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, but it still kind of sucked, unfortunately.

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I thought it was kind of cool.

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Well, you know, the game was great.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're simple-minded.

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No, the game was great, don't get me wrong, but it sucked because it was over before it

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
started.

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, there is that.

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah.

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,440
I was selected to say a welcome back to Dark Soccer because she was actually out last week,

102
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,000
but did you girls have fun at Disneyland?

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And it rained on us.

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh, no, because I was there Wednesday, sorry.

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I was like, wasn't I here earlier in the week?

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No, you were here for another show.

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,400
You were here for the other show, but this big show you were out last week.

109
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, I was playing hooky and dancing in the rain.

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're allowed once in a while.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Lots of rain here.

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And I was watching Chris fall head first into the lagoon.

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You know what?

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That was not my fucking fault, okay?

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I know.

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
I was on this little kiddie boat ride, and anyone who's been to Disneyland, it's the

117
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,320
storybook ride where you just pretty much sit in a boat and look at these little miniatures

118
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,160
that are from the stories, and it was raining, and neither of the people who were helping

119
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,120
me into the boat were really paying attention, so I slipped and almost went head first into

120
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
the water.

121
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
Yeah, I think I caught you.

122
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Oh, no.

123
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
No, I know.

124
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Well, you probably did.

125
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Yeah.

126
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
It was just really funny.

127
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
I caught your arm.

128
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
Everybody was laughing at me.

129
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,120
I almost fell on the Hudson River, but we'll have to save that story for another time.

130
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,920
And then someone kept dropping cold water down the back of my sweater on It's a Small

131
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
World.

132
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Yeah, well, you're a whore.

133
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Yeah, well, so?

134
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
Okay.

135
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,000
Anyway, before we get into pillow fights, we better talk about your gaming week.

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,240
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

137
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Cookie Mama!

138
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,960
Lots of Cookie Mama, because Mama will make it better.

139
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,720
Have you been poking Mama's steak?

140
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,960
Yes, I have, and Mama liked it.

141
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,220
For those that don't catch the reference, there's obviously a part of the game where

142
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,720
you have to poke the steak.

143
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,680
Describe what Cookie Mama's all about, for those that haven't heard of it, because we

144
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
get new listeners every week.

145
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,200
You use the stylus and you cook, really.

146
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,400
Like you shake the pan.

147
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,440
You blow on the pot to cool it off.

148
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,160
It's like, some of those levels make me think of DDR with food.

149
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,720
Beat Mania with food is like Cookie Mania, but I don't know.

150
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,440
It's a pretty fun little addicting game, because Mama will make it better.

151
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
To quote Chris.

152
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,640
Is that it?

153
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
Just Cookie Mama?

154
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,080
Just Cookie Mama, and Creature from the Black Lagoon, Pinball.

155
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
Ah!

156
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,280
Is that a new one, or is that one you guys had?

157
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
I can't keep track anymore.

158
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,880
We got it a few weeks ago.

159
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,480
We're still working, though, on the Rocky and Bull angle.

160
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,880
Wasn't there something about your Guns N' Roses table damn near went backstage to a Guns

161
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
N' Roses concert?

162
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,760
Yeah, and then all that fell through, and then they canceled the Sacramento show.

163
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,160
I hate you, Axl Rose!

164
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
You bastard!

165
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,680
I hate you for the Metallica thing.

166
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,120
Yeah, ho ho ho to you, too.

167
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,280
Oh, by the way, Happy Holidays to all of our listeners.

168
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,640
Happy Christmas, Kwanzaa, or whatever it is you celebrate, because I think Hanukkah started.

169
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Yeah, we're in the middle of Hanukkah.

170
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
Yule is the 21st.

171
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Uh-huh.

172
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
We got Yule on the 21st.

173
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Kwanzaa is after Christmas.

174
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
I think, what?

175
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Starts the 27th?

176
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
God, I hope I'm right.

177
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
There's too many holidays to remember.

178
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
I'm sorry.

179
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
And then Christmas is on the 25th.

180
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,240
And so whatever it is you celebrate, I hope you're having a good one.

181
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,640
And we should probably give an advance Happy Birthday to another person who has been on

182
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,840
the show.

183
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
Happy Birthday to Megzi.

184
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Ah.

185
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Right.

186
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Say it.

187
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
Happy Birthday.

188
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
I'm going to see her on it.

189
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:18,680
No, we want to hear the Happy Birthday, Miss Megzi.

190
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,400
We also have our chat room, of course, joins us every episode.

191
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,880
And Alex in our chat room says, Happy Festivus.

192
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,280
There you go.

193
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Happy everything.

194
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Happy everything.

195
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
I like that.

196
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
That's what we should start saying.

197
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,760
I like joyous stuff.

198
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,240
Um, Loki, how was your gaming week?

199
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
It was okay.

200
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,560
I played, well, I played Elibits, and Elibits is fun.

201
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,320
And I'm actually kind of far in it, well, not too far, I guess.

202
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,480
I'm on level 9 now.

203
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,880
And I don't know, I tried playing around with the level editor a little bit.

204
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
I was kind of surprised, though.

205
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,120
I still haven't seen any edit data from anybody else yet.

206
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,240
You know, and I know a bunch of my friends have to have this game, and yet I see no level

207
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,600
data.

208
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,800
I haven't been playing it enough, sorry.

209
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,960
But I did try making dominoes in that, and the books don't work very well as dominoes.

210
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,240
Although I kind of got a little chain going, but it's just that you get frustrated after

211
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,600
a while and then you just start throwing everything around, and that's kind of fun.

212
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,160
Then I played Cars for the Wii that I bought for Nellie because she wanted another racing

213
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,240
game and she insisted on Cars, and the game sucks balls.

214
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,720
And I knew when I bought it that it was going to be awful, and I just had no idea how bad

215
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
it sucked.

216
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,780
But it is awful.

217
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,780
Why is it so awful?

218
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,560
Because it seems like games based on movies usually are a little weaker than usually.

219
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
Sometimes you have some good ones.

220
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,680
Well, if you played the 360 demo, I mean, that was okay.

221
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,220
The graphics at least looked pretty good.

222
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:01,920
Usually the game is full of just random catch freezes from the movie, and then the racing

223
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:11,000
itself is very slow, and the car steers like a tank, it can't turn for shit, and there's

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,020
a bunch of useless ass moves that you can do in the game, and it's just really bad.

225
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,620
It's meant for little kids, that's really what it is, but Nellie wanted an easy game

226
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,440
to play, so there's Cars, and I guess she'll have to play that.

227
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Although she's been ignoring Cars and playing more Excite Truck instead, and she's trying

228
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,080
to get all the S rankings in mirror mode like Christopher has, so that he, you know, because

229
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
you all...

230
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,920
Oh my god, my roommate is obsessed with Excite Truck.

231
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,660
I doubt there's anybody in the world that has played this game as much as Xtavor.

232
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,120
He's beaten Excite, Super Excite, Mirror Mode, and now he got all the trophies or something,

233
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,760
so he got some super car thing that flashes when he drives, and he can just go right through

234
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,300
trees and right through other cars.

235
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,400
That's what you get for passing S ranks on all of the Mirror Mode stuff, you get basically

236
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,440
a crazy monster truck that has the POW energy thing throughout the entire race, so you can

237
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,840
slam through cars, trees, etc.

238
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,640
It's the ultimate woman driver, basically.

239
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,720
But there's some other stuff I guess you get in there.

240
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,440
Chris, can you describe this look on your face to the listeners?

241
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
No.

242
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,240
Because after Loki said that, I felt this death stare coming from Chris.

243
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,280
And of course, you know, more Grand Theft Auto, more...

244
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,160
I've actually been playing a little bit of Saintsboro, it's still fun to play at lunches

245
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,440
and stuff, but really it's just like there's not a lot coming out until fucking January.

246
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,440
In January there's only one Wii game, WarioWare, and that's it.

247
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,720
But seriously, if you've seen that YouTube clip of the dancing stage in WarioWare, you

248
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,280
know that this game is all you need for January.

249
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,840
I mean, seriously.

250
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:01,240
That's great, but you know, just other things that you want to play and stuff, even for

251
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,680
the 360 there's really nothing I want to pick up.

252
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,520
Well January's always a dead month, really, for games though, isn't it?

253
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,120
I did play Assault Heroes, and that was fun.

254
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,240
I like that.

255
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,040
Although people are comparing it to Quarry Warriors or something like that, it's not

256
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,800
exactly like that, but I guess you could...

257
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
It's pretty fun.

258
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,880
Actually, it kind of reminds me if they did an update to Breakthrough, I don't know if

259
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,320
anyone ever remembers that game, but it's kind of like that, you're in a giant death

260
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,880
car type thing with a gatling gun on it, and you're fighting giant machines and things.

261
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,440
Let's go to the chat room for some comments.

262
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,840
I noticed some new people in chat tonight, so hello to those of you, hopefully we get

263
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,760
some of your comments read.

264
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,560
Jared Joe says Excite Truck got old quite quickly.

265
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,880
So for me, it kind of did, I was like, okay, I'm kind of done with Excite Truck.

266
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,640
I pop it in once in a while for fun, but I think it's more Extraverse Excitement wears

267
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,760
off on me, but I don't know, maybe it's something about the casual gamer, because you notice

268
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,400
the people that are really into this that we know are two people who don't usually play

269
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
a lot of games.

270
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,880
But she's not playing it casually anymore, she's playing it for hours.

271
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,480
I know, but there's the casual gamer that plays Bejeweled for hours, so it's just interesting.

272
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,680
I don't know what it is about that game.

273
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,640
It's the gross simplicity of the controls and everything, I think.

274
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,480
The game really could have benefited from more tracks, and maybe more diverse cars or

275
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,440
something else, like different types of cars.

276
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,480
That's what I really think, because it comes down to, you play basically like five different

277
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,040
continents, and each track kind of has portions of other tracks in it, so you'll drive on

278
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,480
the same stretch of track.

279
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,720
Airtoast in our chat room says I didn't like Excite Truck until I put my own MP3s in, it

280
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
makes it so much better.

281
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Oh, yeah.

282
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
Yeah.

283
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Yeah.

284
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I only need to do that.

285
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,520
I haven't really done that with Excite Truck, because I don't have my own SD card, but I

286
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,400
know Xterfer does, and he does that.

287
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,040
That's what I do with Burnout, which is the racing game I've been playing a lot lately.

288
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,520
I don't like all the emo EA tracks that are in it, so I put my own music, and I'm like

289
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,720
Sin-Poppin' 80s and Madonna, yeah!

290
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,780
You can just imagine what my Burnout games look like, you know, I'm flying through the

291
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,960
air and you know, I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you.

292
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Crap!

293
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,840
That's what it's like to play Burnout with me.

294
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,320
Is that it?

295
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
That's it.

296
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Alright, My Gaming Week.

297
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,040
I've also been playing Elibits a little bit, not a lot to really give my full opinions

298
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,280
on the game yet, but I can definitely tell this was a game where the Wii stuff was not

299
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
an afterthought.

300
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,360
I mean, even with Zelda, you kind of go, well, the game wasn't originally designed for the

301
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,920
Wii, and you know, definitely Trauma Center wasn't originally designed for the Wii, and

302
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,420
those are some of the strongest launch titles we had, but the cool thing about Elibits is

303
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,400
it was definitely designed with the Wii in mind, and it's kind of cool, you know, I think

304
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,000
the comparisons to Katamari Damacy are fair, I think it has a lot of that same cuteness

305
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,120
factor, I think the only kind of weak point is the music does not have the same infectiousness

306
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,440
as Katamari Damacy does, and to be honest, I think that's really what sets the two games

307
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
apart.

308
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,860
But so far, so good gameplay-wise, which is, you know, what's really important about a

309
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,480
game, I'm liking the whole discovering aspect, and the levels take a long time to beat, I

310
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,960
thought it was gonna be like quickie little three-minute levels, these levels take like

311
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,040
fifteen minutes to play, it's pretty crazy, but the Elibits meow, and that's cute, because

312
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,880
I like, I like, you know, the microwave going off in here, meow, meow, meow, it's cute,

313
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,260
and I got a little stuffed Elibit, it's so cute, it's a little blue Elibit, adorable.

314
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,840
As far as the game is, where I have played enough of it, I think to give a fair review,

315
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,840
I did check out Final Fantasy III on the DS, which Loki was kind enough to give me a copy

316
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,200
of, thank you, the one aspect of this game I have not been able to review is the Wi-Fi,

317
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,080
because no one's given me their stinking code, so I'm gonna have to go on the OL Army forums

318
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,800
over at orangeonshredo.com and see if anyone has the Final Fantasy III on the DS, because

319
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,480
I'm really curious, I mean, you can send letters through the moogles and towns, but that's

320
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,960
about it, so it kind of seems like the Wi-Fi thing is, like, pointless, but I hear that's

321
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,080
how you unlock one of the jobs later on, so who knows, but otherwise, Final Fantasy III,

322
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,740
obviously, the missing Final Fantasy game that we never had here in the US, remember,

323
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,240
this is not Final Fantasy III on Super Nintendo, this is the original Final Fantasy III that

324
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,560
was on the NES, well, well liked in Japan, beloved game from the Final Fantasy series,

325
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,800
kind of a precursor to Final Fantasy V of sorts, has a very similar job system, and

326
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,040
if you haven't played Final Fantasy V, I guess the closest thing I could compare it to would

327
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,240
be Tactics, where you kind of select a job and you're leveling within that job with your

328
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,800
different characters, it's kind of neat having it in the 3D form, it kind of looks like Final

329
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,660
Fantasy VII style game on your DS, but in the old school, like, you know, less emo,

330
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,540
no Cloud, no Aerith, you know, more the traditional Final Fantasy, well, okay, maybe a little

331
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:48,660
bit of emo, but it's kind of cool, it's, it feels like I'm playing, again, an old Super

332
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,600
Nintendo Final Fantasy game, but, like, with the 3D graphics, I'm kind of like, this is

333
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,160
kind of, this is kind of how I like it, you know, I still like my games to feel retro,

334
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,600
even when they have the newer graphics, so that's what I, you know, really dig about

335
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,120
it, otherwise the DS features itself are a little silly, I mean, you can use the touch

336
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,120
controls to move your character around, but it's kind of pointless, maybe that's just

337
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,260
because I, you know, I'm so used to controlling Final Fantasies with a control pad, I kind

338
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,240
of can't do it any other way, and the top screen is, like, sometimes a map, but for

339
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,020
most of the game, it's just off, you don't really use it, I mean, the top screen's just

340
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,160
kind of there, but, I mean, that's okay, I'm kind of okay with the fact they're not really

341
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,200
whoring the DS features of it, they just kind of used what they needed, and then, you know,

342
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,960
kind of just gave us, used the system power to give us the game we desired, so, obviously,

343
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,900
if you're a fan of the Final Fantasy series, you have to have this game, I mean, it's such

344
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:44,360
a loved game in the series, it's got a good plot, good music, going lots of the soundtrack

345
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,960
course and all that, if you're not so much a fan of role-playing games, I don't think

346
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,560
this one's going to be a good starter, because the difficulty level is a little higher, the

347
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,960
game does not really tell you what to do so much, you can't easily get hints, it was not

348
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,800
brought over here the first time, I believe, because they thought Americans would not get

349
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:10,440
it, so keep in mind the game is a little bit harder than most of the other, you know, Final

350
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,920
Fantasy games that came later on where it was very easy to get hints when you didn't

351
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,440
know what to do, so, not good for the first-time role-player, but for, you know, someone who's

352
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,280
into role-playing games, you definitely have to check this out, I think it's too bad because

353
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,800
I think a lot of people forgot about this game amongst the Wii and PS3 releases, and

354
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,080
that was my gaming week, Chris, how about you, how was your gaming week?

355
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:48,080
My gaming week, aside from making mama really mad, I actually, and I played Sims 2, obviously,

356
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,880
that's all I play.

357
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,080
Do you do any of the fanfic stuff in Sims 2, because Jamie was just showing us a picture

358
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,160
of the doctor and Rose in bed together in Sims 2, do you do that kind of stuff?

359
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,120
You know, I used to play the, just the Sims, and I used to put, like, anything I found

360
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,240
on the internet, I'd put it in there, and I don't do that with this game because it

361
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,520
really messes it up, and you, I mean, they have it so that if you want to customize it,

362
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,680
you can, but it still messes it up to no end, so I just, I don't do that, and I just make

363
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,240
random characters that do stuff, I don't know, I just, I like getting the, like, they have

364
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,800
little things that your characters can work up to, so I've been trying to do that, but

365
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,320
I actually played a PS3.

366
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Did you?

367
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
What'd you think?

368
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,840
I didn't like it.

369
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
What'd you play on it?

370
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,280
Well, it's, I don't know, it was in a kiosk, and it was at Target, and it was free, because

371
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,040
every time I go in there, it's either off, like, the kiosk is either off, or someone's

372
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,480
using it, and it was just sitting there, I'm like, oh, well, I might as well, and I like

373
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,020
the graphics, I mean, obviously, Sony's known for their graphics, so, and I was playing

374
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,720
it for, like, five minutes, the control, I'm not really into car games, so the controls

375
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,720
were kind of wonky at first, and then, as soon as I started getting used to it, it's

376
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,560
like, oh, this is not too bad, it froze!

377
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,600
That thing apparently has done that, like, once a day.

378
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,240
I don't know why, I asked the guy, I'm like, did I do something, did I break it, he's like,

379
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
nah, it's probably just froze, like, rubber.

380
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,920
To be fair to Sony, though, these things, you know, are definitely used more than the

381
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,360
regular PlayStation 3s in your house, these things are played to death, you know.

382
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,240
I know, but they almost sold me.

383
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Really?

384
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
Yeah!

385
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,680
Well, it was, I was sitting there going, it's like, oh, this is not too bad, I mean, but,

386
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,200
you know, between Jamie and Meg Z, they're like, Sony's evil!

387
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,520
It is the devil!

388
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:44,200
You know, so, and then I finally, you know, actually get to play it, and, you know, it

389
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,560
was like, oh, this is not bad, because I like the graphics, but other than that, then it

390
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,960
froze on me, and I was pissed off, I also got a little farther in Rule of Rose, that

391
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,280
game was weird.

392
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,400
But now, when Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out for the PlayStation 3, though, you'll be all over

393
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
a PS3, it's like, yep, yep, king ring it up, here it is, Kingdom Hearts.

394
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,600
I like Kingdom Hearts.

395
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,640
That's how I'll be when Fall of Asi 13 comes out, that'll finally be the one that wins

396
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
me over.

397
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,360
Although, you know, and I don't think it made tonight's show roll, so I'm okay in saying

398
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,520
this, and if I took somebody's story, I apologize, but I believe there was a late-breaking story,

399
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,640
I don't know if it's a rumor status or what's going on, but that Metal Gear Solid 4, which

400
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,520
was one of the PS3's big, big exclusives, some insider information coming from, like,

401
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,200
a friend who knows a guy at Konami or something, you know, take it with a grain of salt, that

402
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,160
it is coming to the 360 a couple months after the PlayStation.

403
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,400
Megsy told me that.

404
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,520
She was like, she's like, I am so happy that they're gonna bring it, because she's, for

405
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:42,280
Christmas, she's getting a bunch of money, so she's gonna end up going to get an Xbox,

406
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,880
and she was like, if they're gonna put, it's like, if they're gonna start putting stuff

407
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,080
on the Xbox, I don't need to get a PS3.

408
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
I am so happy.

409
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,320
So, she actually told me about that.

410
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,320
If only, like, Kingdom Hearts 3 could come out on 360, then great, then it's it.

411
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
Yeah, then I have to go buy that.

412
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Yeah, yeah.

413
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Alright.

414
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,280
Anyway, if you wanna join our chat room and participate in the conversations with us,

415
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,040
it's chat.orangeloungeradio.com, head on over there, and we got a nice, full chat room tonight,

416
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,120
so thanks, you guys, for sticking with us.

417
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,280
Some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's news.

418
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,320
Earlier in our last week's show, I should say, I promised that there'd be some big changes

419
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,720
coming to our website, and realistically, that's probably not gonna happen now until,

420
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
like, January.

421
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,360
We're trying to plan, like, a big overhaul for the website, so stay tuned for that.

422
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:30,640
We know that our website is, it has room for improvements, let's just put it that way,

423
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:39,280
so although we love our webmaster who helps us out, it's just, it's the site itself we

424
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,280
just kinda wanna try some different things with, so you can look for that, hopefully

425
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,680
in January-ish.

426
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:50,060
Also we should say, this is our last live show of 2006, if you can believe it, because

427
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:55,000
next Sunday is Christmas Eve, and the Sunday after that is New Year's Eve, and of course

428
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,920
we have respective, you know, family and friend plans for those days, and we imagine most

429
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,520
of you guys do, too, so, you know.

430
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,720
They have no lies outside of you, Rob.

431
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,480
I like to think that, but no, no, we know that you guys probably have your own things

432
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,640
going on, so we will be delivering new content to the podcast feeds, certainly look for,

433
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,760
you know, a year-end round-up type show, our top games of the year, those types of things

434
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,420
will be pre-recorded and coming to our audio archive, which is available on our website,

435
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:28,220
just click on podcast over at orangeloungeradio.com.

436
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,880
One other quick thing I wanted to say, I wanted to give a quick plug for iTunes, and leaving

437
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,920
us reviews there, like happy things, because the more reviews we get in iTunes, the more

438
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,680
people notice the show, and you know, we're all about, hey, we do this show for free,

439
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,960
and we try not to ask for too much, you know, we, in the beginning, I think when we first

440
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,240
started podcasting, we got all up on this, oh, you got to vote for us on Podcast Alley

441
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,960
and, oh, give us a good thing on Yahoo Podcast, and now we kind of, you know, we're just kind

442
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,760
of like, okay, whatever, we just want to, people to spread the word, that's all we ask.

443
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,340
If you enjoy the show, tell a friend about the show, you know, tell somebody, you know,

444
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,480
but leaving the iTunes reviews, I mean, honestly, iTunes being the biggest thing, that really

445
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,180
does help us, because then it boosts our ranking there and what shows up on the front page

446
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,360
and all that stuff, and that, so if you don't have any friends to tell, or friends that

447
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,960
would appreciate this program, you can leave us a happy review on iTunes and that would

448
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,680
be permissible, we'd like that, so, thank you guys, appreciate it.

449
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,840
Alright, enough, enough begging and pleading, let's get into some gaming news, the core

450
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,160
of what we're about, and, but, but, but begging and pleading is awesome, especially when I

451
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
get stuff.

452
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,000
Well, do you want to beg for something?

453
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
No.

454
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Okay.

455
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Are you, are you above begging?

456
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm above everything.

457
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Alright.

458
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's not what she said last night.

459
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What?

460
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You liked it?

461
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What?

462
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That's not what she said last night.

463
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

464
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah, but you didn't argue.

465
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,160
Okay, well, this, this sounds like something we ought to send over to Howard Stern instead.

466
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,920
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

467
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,440
Let's go to game news, and we'll start off with some kind of exclusive stuff, I think?

468
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Yeah.

469
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
Insider stuff.

470
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,560
That's an update to stuff that we mentioned before.

471
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,600
Okay, first, you know, because we have new listeners every week, thanks to, like, xbstream

472
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,760
and iTunes and people spreading the word and all that, folks may not know how you get some

473
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,500
insider information, so really quickly, how do you get insider information, and how reliable

474
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
is it?

475
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,360
I work for a game distributor, and usually the information I get is pretty reliable,

476
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,720
seeing as it's coming from the actual companies putting out these games, and we do keep a

477
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,600
constant update with a lot of them, especially through the holidays, because we're cutting

478
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,640
POs, like, every day and stuff, so.

479
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,120
But I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be the devil's advocate here, you know, just going from your

480
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:46,480
track record in 2006, it's a little bit hit and miss, like, we found that your ties really

481
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,960
tell us, like, the new games that are coming out, like, you knew about PlayStation 3 Oblivion

482
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,440
long before anyone else did, and mentioned it on this program, obviously, one of the

483
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,160
big things that had us out there in 2006 was the Konami before E3, you knew there were

484
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,340
gonna be two DDRs for Xbox, Xbox 360, you knew there was a Castlevania game coming on

485
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,840
DS, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

486
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
Release dates?

487
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,160
It's harder because the companies move them around.

488
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:14,360
It's really companies that move that shit around because I wish it were, you know, announce

489
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:20,080
a release date and actually the game comes out, you know, that day, but that's usually

490
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,320
not the case because they're shifting their priorities around, you know, working on certain

491
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,480
games, certain games are behind in development or ahead in development or, you know, certain

492
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,780
games are done and they're just waiting for, you know, certification, so, there's a lot

493
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,620
of factors that shift the dates around every day, you know, type of things.

494
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,300
Alright, so you have release date news now for two big games.

495
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,300
Two big games.

496
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,660
One that we've been talking about forever on this program, and one kind of for me a

497
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,620
surprising move, but anyway, I'll shut up.

498
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,060
Anyways, so, of course we mentioned the big, it was the big news, you know, we mentioned

499
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,620
back that Halo 3 will be coming out March 15th.

500
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,660
It has been delayed a little bit, you know, probably because they're not done with it

501
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:09,640
yet, but the new date now from Microsoft is May 15th, and, you know, who knows, that could

502
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,420
change once we get closer to May, but as of right now, it is May 15th.

503
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,580
Now that date makes a little bit of sense, and in some ways and not in others.

504
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,020
To me it makes sense because of the beta test that was almost going to happen in March.

505
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,300
That's the appropriate time frame, right, but, so we knew that March date was going

506
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,500
out the window when they announced it.

507
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,820
And the March date too, it would make sense too that they'd move, because they've got

508
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,920
other games coming out in March, and to stack three Microsoft games in one month, I mean,

509
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,420
they don't want one game, especially Halo 3, they don't want that detracting from the

510
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,060
sales of other games, so, you know, you want to move stuff around.

511
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,700
But one of the other big things that pointed towards the possible spring release was the

512
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,580
whole fiscal year thing, and now May 15th is now a new fiscal year, so that's kind of

513
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,820
one of the things where I go, well, that's different, but maybe do they just, you know,

514
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:58,500
trying to have a lot of, because maybe they think Sony and Nintendo are not going to have

515
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,560
a lot of big titles in 2008?

516
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
And usually...

517
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,900
Or I should say the 07-08 fiscal year?

518
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,580
Well usually April-May is pretty slow, I mean, I think, what, last year, or I should say

519
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:15,940
this year, during May, the big game release was, well, they had X-Men 3, Hitman Blood

520
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:22,460
Money, and Jaws Unleashed, so, I mean, that's not really that big, I mean, when you think

521
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,020
about it.

522
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,420
So it makes sense that they would, you know, kind of push it back, because there's a lot

523
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:33,140
of games coming out, and they also, you know, they're pushing to sell more hardware units

524
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:39,260
right now, and I think a lot of people are buying 360s, because, again, can't get a hold

525
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:44,620
of a Playstation 3, and kind of listening to what they're doing with a Playstation 3

526
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,140
and how they're still having trouble getting units out there, despite the fact that they're

527
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,460
still seeing 2 million by the end of the year, right?

528
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,980
It's probably, they're thinking that's going to be when they're starting to catch up a

529
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,100
little bit, and then they just need something else to kind of pull the attention away from

530
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,580
Sony type thing.

531
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:06,300
So, you know, that could change, I mean, also Forza 2 was scheduled for May now, so there's

532
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,660
a lot of stuff that's being, you know, delayed, and, you know, I'm not surprised.

533
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:16,820
The other game that got delayed, though, into February, is Wii Play, and that I'm kind of

534
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,860
surprised about, because the game's done, and it's just, I was surprised to hear that

535
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,020
one too, when you posted in our, you know, obviously Wii host discussed what we were going

536
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,820
to talk about on the show beforehand, and I was kind of surprised to read that too,

537
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,780
because I was thinking the same thing, the game's done, why do they need to push it back

538
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,780
to February?

539
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,780
Is there that much localization?

540
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,300
Unless they're worried that Warrior Aware's going to take away from it or something, which

541
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,580
I don't understand why they would do that, but, whatever the case may be, Wii Play's

542
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:47,340
delayed to February 20th, it used to be actually one month prior, I think on January 19th is

543
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,740
when we had it before, which is great, because that was, you know, the two games I was going

544
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,280
to get for the Wii, because that was pretty much it, that was coming out.

545
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,660
Would it be production issues because of the free remote that comes with it?

546
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,380
It's possible that they just don't have enough remotes to go with it, and that would make

547
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,380
sense.

548
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,800
Or, you know, as we're going to talk about a little later on in Part B, which I'm sure

549
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,260
a lot of folks have heard about on the internet this week, the fact that they're going to

550
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,060
have to go back and change a lot of the remotes, could that be doing with it?

551
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:18,180
They started shipping those new remotes with the new straps since the Australian launch,

552
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:24,180
and they've even had some, actually, all the remotes and systems that are shipped after

553
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:30,540
this Monday will have the new straps in them, so, not really, I don't think that's a huge

554
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,740
issue because, you know, the straps are easy to manufacture, it's probably the remotes

555
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,500
because they're really having trouble getting a lot of accessories out.

556
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Interesting.

557
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:45,040
All right, well, thank you very much for the, I guess, exclusive news, and we'll see how

558
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
it plays out.

559
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:51,420
I mean, I look for date changes every single day, three times, four times a day, and Halo,

560
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,900
as soon as I saw that change, I had two times a day.

561
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,500
But that also kind of makes me go, okay, well, what's to say it's not going to move again?

562
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,500
And I don't know.

563
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,140
I don't know if it's not going to move again, and really, it could just, I've seen games

564
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,580
that were scheduled to come out last year, and now they're scheduled to come out in 2007,

565
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:12,680
so it all depends on how quickly, you know, they're getting the game done.

566
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,540
I would trust your date more than the, you know, placeholders that people use on EB Games

567
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,540
and GameStop.

568
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,180
You know, they go, oh, the game's coming out 11-1.

569
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,020
Well, yeah, they're saying, oh, it's going to come out for Christmas because they want

570
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,340
to sell it during Christmas.

571
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,820
That may be, they may want to try to sell it on the anniversary of Halo or something

572
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,820
like that, but I don't think that they're really going to hold to that, you know, just

573
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,260
because, I don't know, they'll sell it when it's done.

574
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,100
All right, well, the game will be out when it's out, so we'll see if you were right or

575
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,100
not, Loki.

576
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:51,900
Well, there have been some strange goings-on, at least concerning Microsoft and Halo 3.

577
00:30:51,900 --> 00:31:00,900
Apparently, there was a site in Europe that was trying to sell the promotional codes for

578
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,900
the Halo 3 beta that are actually supposed to be given out as a promotional item, so

579
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,140
they've been, they've had the major smackdown on them.

580
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,940
And basically, they are not going to receive the beta codes.

581
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:19,780
They're being removed from the Xbox community network immediately.

582
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:25,820
They are, Microsoft is not going to have any involvement with their sites.

583
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,060
They're completely cutting them off.

584
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,140
No, no goods, no nothing.

585
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,140
You've been excommunicated from the Church of the Gates.

586
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,140
Seriously.

587
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,180
But it's basically people trying to turn a profit on something that doesn't really belong

588
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,180
to them to sell.

589
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,180
Well, yeah, they shouldn't do that crap, you know.

590
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,180
I say they have it coming.

591
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,900
I'm kind of glad Microsoft is laying the smackdown, you know.

592
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,220
Let's hear it for some values.

593
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,780
There you go.

594
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
What?

595
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,540
Microsoft is going to have to choke a bitch.

596
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,860
Is Bill Gates going to have to choke a bitch?

597
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:02,740
All right, I guess that would more be like probably Peter Moore choking a bitch, or Major

598
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,740
Nelson.

599
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,140
Maybe we'll see why they call him Major.

600
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
Anyway.

601
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:12,820
Why is somebody in the chat room named Marky Mark?

602
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,620
That's funny.

603
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,060
Maybe that's their name.

604
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,900
Maybe the Funky Bunch is not far behind, or maybe they hear that line a lot.

605
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,900
That's fantastic.

606
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,620
Marky Mark, you are the chat room hero.

607
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,460
But look, Marky Mark is the first to bitch though.

608
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,620
Why all this old news?

609
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,620
Well, you know, we do a show weekly.

610
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:35,080
I don't know if you heard, but we do a show weekly, so sometimes we have to do stories

611
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,500
that might have come out on Monday.

612
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
I don't know.

613
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,900
Well, something that came out mid-week was a brand new update for Xbox 360 backward compatibility,

614
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,940
and a bunch of new games have been announced as finally being backwards compatible on the

615
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:54,000
Xbox 360, and the short list would include games such as Destroy All Humans, Buffy the

616
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,260
Vampire Slayer, Family Guy, Mortal Kombat Armageddon, Psychonauts, which a lot of folks

617
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:07,620
are waiting for, Scarface, Soul Calibur 2, and a lot of other titles, many, many, many

618
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,740
titles, and the list is now over 300 original Xbox titles.

619
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,140
If you want to see the complete list, you can check that out.

620
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,820
Major Nelson posted a list on his blog, or you can head over to the Xbox official website

621
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,380
to check that out.

622
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,380
Yes.

623
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,380
Yes, ma'am.

624
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,420
For dumb people, what does backwards compatibility mean?

625
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,420
Oh, no.

626
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,420
Not a problem.

627
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:34,220
I mean, you play casual games, but you do more computer gaming, right, than you do console?

628
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,620
I don't do a lot of console games.

629
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,860
I mostly do, yeah, computer games.

630
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,860
Not a problem.

631
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,380
I do not know what backwards- A gamer on a Mac!

632
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,380
Not a problem.

633
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,380
Shut up!

634
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,380
No, I'm pointing out.

635
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
Mac games.

636
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,380
No, well, people, bitch, we don't cover enough computer gaming on this show, so I'm glad

637
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,380
to hear that.

638
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,540
So, no, backwards compatible means, you know how there's the original Xbox and the Xbox

639
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,540
360?

640
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,340
Well, like, you know, when PlayStation came out, everybody, you know, one of the biggest

641
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,660
things about the PlayStation 2 is that, oh, all my old PlayStation games will work on

642
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,660
it.

643
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,580
When PlayStation 3 came out, it was, oh, you know, all my old PlayStation 2 games will

644
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,300
work on it, and so on and so on.

645
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,640
But when the Xbox 360 came out, it was, well, we have software emulation because we changed

646
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:18,580
our graphics chip, so some of the games will work on it, and we'll release updates every

647
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,820
so often, and we're going to get 99% of our library.

648
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,820
What did he say?

649
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,540
It was supposed to be every month, and it's been every six months or whatever.

650
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,340
Needless to say, Microsoft hasn't been quite as speedy as we would have liked, but they're

651
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,900
trying to get more of the old-school Xbox titles playable.

652
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,540
Not a problem.

653
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,540
Not a problem.

654
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
Anyways.

655
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:43,340
So, yeah, speaking of, you know, being behind on updates and stuff, well, one of the updates

656
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:49,300
that just recently happened to the dashboard is causing a lot of stir, especially with

657
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,300
people claiming that it's bricked their console and now they want their share of the profits.

658
00:34:54,300 --> 00:35:01,060
So, as we mentioned last week, there was a class-action lawsuit filed by some guy for

659
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:07,300
damages basically caused by this update, and now there's been some actual updates to this

660
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,460
and what exactly it was about.

661
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:17,500
The whole premise of this class-action lawsuit was they claimed that because of this update,

662
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:22,060
they had to have their console fixed, and Microsoft wanted $140 to fix their console

663
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,300
instead of doing it for free because it was their fault.

664
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,900
And so, he's basically saying that they're using this to profit from it.

665
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:37,940
And he's seeking $5 million in damages, which is basically just to get them into the correct

666
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,940
courthouse.

667
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:46,120
They, you know, will of course adjust the amount depending on how many people are claiming

668
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,260
to have the same problem.

669
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:55,140
Right now, it's about 400 people, or 1% of, well they're saying 1% of the 360 owners right

670
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,380
now have this problem, and 400 people have come forward saying that they do have this

671
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,380
problem.

672
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:06,080
But, you know, I think, I thought that what I heard before that they were fixing these

673
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,380
for free, you know, the ones that were, you know, affected by this because I guess they'd

674
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,940
pop up a certain error code and they would just be able to replace the console for free,

675
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:18,220
but I mean, if it's actually true that they're charging $140 to fix the console, then yeah,

676
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,220
he's right.

677
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,340
Well, it sounds to me like it took a minute for the left hand to tell the right hand what

678
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,340
was going on.

679
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,340
I think so.

680
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,860
You know, it's such a big company like Microsoft, I'm thinking these people got told they were

681
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,820
going to have to pay before they realized the scope of what was happening.

682
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,820
You know what I mean?

683
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,820
I think so, yeah.

684
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,060
That sounds like what happened to me.

685
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,540
But I don't think that, I mean...

686
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:41,620
No, I think if Microsoft realized their error, apologized for it, and fixed the machines,

687
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,160
there should not be a lawsuit.

688
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
There shouldn't be a lawsuit.

689
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,780
People have a right to be mad at them and question, you know, if they want to trust

690
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,380
them in the future, but lawsuits are totally unnecessary.

691
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,740
Here's what they need to do, and this is basically what they did before with the overheating

692
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,420
problem with the consoles.

693
00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:00,020
People had to send them in to get fixed, say they sent it in to get fixed for this specific

694
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,020
issue.

695
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,620
If they paid the money to have it fixed, they would be refunded this money.

696
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,740
If they haven't, you know, sent it in yet, they would be fixing them for free.

697
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:14,040
It's just like they did with the consoles sold at launch that were having heating issues

698
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,340
and if your console bricked because of that, they would fix it for free, or they will send

699
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:23,620
you a refund for the amount that you paid to fix it.

700
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,220
And I was pissed when my console bricked.

701
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,180
Go back and listen to a show around, it was around Valentine's Day when this happened,

702
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,720
and I was pissed when my console bricked.

703
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,500
And I said a lot of nasty things about Microsoft, but when we say a console was bricked, Chris

704
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
is like, bricked?

705
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,220
When we say a console is bricked, that means it broke, so you can't do anything but hold

706
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,980
down paper with it, essentially, that's why we call it bricks.

707
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,660
I'm helping people who may not know that.

708
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,660
That's all right.

709
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,260
And then also the other cool term I like is that they send you a coffin, and the coffin

710
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,260
is what you put the brick in because you're sending it back to Microsoft to be buried.

711
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:02,200
I wish though, I understand why they want to do these lawsuits and stuff, but I really

712
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,540
wish that people would just have better communication with these companies and I'm sure that they

713
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:13,140
could resolve it out of court instead of saying, I'm going to sue you until you do what I say,

714
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:20,820
and they really just need to open more of a discussion before going and throwing lawsuits

715
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,820
down.

716
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
Because you know what?

717
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:27,100
I can bet you that within a few weeks we'll be reporting that someone's going to file

718
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:34,020
a class action lawsuit over this goddamn Wiimote strap shit because, oh, they knew it was broken

719
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,700
because that's why they're fixing it.

720
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,860
Well, you know what?

721
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,980
There was actually some companies that did some, or I should say websites that did independent

722
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,660
testing on this, and that fucking wrist strap held enough weight, okay?

723
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,620
What you're doing is beyond abuse.

724
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,020
We'll get into the Wii stuff later.

725
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,020
We're still on Xbox now.

726
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,020
Whatever.

727
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,020
Calm down, Loki.

728
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,020
Calm down.

729
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,020
All right.

730
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,020
Anyway, I wanted to read some chat comments.

731
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,820
First off, I want to clear Marky Mark's name because I said earlier that he said that we

732
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,140
were reporting old news, but he was actually talking about the chat room was talking about

733
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,140
old news.

734
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,480
Marky Mark says, our news rocks, and he still loves us, so thank you, and I wanted to clear

735
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,940
his name there, and you all can play nicely with Marky Mark because he seems like a good

736
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,940
guy.

737
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,440
We have a lot of new people in chat tonight.

738
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
This is awesome.

739
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,500
Thanks, you guys, for coming in the live experience, and if anyone else ever wants to join us live,

740
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,540
we tape Sundays at 6 o'clock Pacific time, although you'll have to wait until 2007 to

741
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,780
really pick that up again.

742
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,120
I guess our first live show would be, what, January 6th or whatever that first Sunday

743
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,100
is in January, so look for us then.

744
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,260
All right.

745
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,980
Is there any other chat comments here?

746
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:44,780
A lot of folks going back and forth between the lawsuit, DDRDollarBill says, I will sue

747
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,320
for stubbing my toe.

748
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,820
Maybe that's from playing too much DDR.

749
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,820
That's from Weird Al.

750
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,340
Mystic, oh, is that what, oh, the Weird Al song that Jamie was playing in her car the

751
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,980
other day, because I was going to say, this whole thing makes me think of that Weird Al

752
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,980
song about all the lawsuits.

753
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,980
No, that's the New Jersey one.

754
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,980
That one was funny.

755
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,980
All right.

756
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,260
Anyway, let's keep it moving with some more gaming news.

757
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,980
But I don't want to move.

758
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,980
I'm comfortable.

759
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,380
Well, I will pick you up and throw you.

760
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,380
No.

761
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:18,380
Well, speaking of throwing, we had someone throw up some secret information, apparently.

762
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:24,540
And I'm sure everyone's familiar with the actress Kristen Bell, yes?

763
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
Veronica Mars?

764
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,540
Yeah.

765
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,060
Well, that's one of Extrovert's favorite shows.

766
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,420
I need to watch that show because apparently Joss is a big fan.

767
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,420
Apparently.

768
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,420
I haven't, I'll be honest.

769
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,800
And Joss Whedon is my lord and master.

770
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,140
I haven't watched it, but I want to.

771
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,820
Joss Whedon is my master now.

772
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,740
Right now, Heroes is my lord and master.

773
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,620
That is the best damn show I've watched in like the past five years.

774
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,740
Those fuckers are making us wait until January for new episodes.

775
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,740
I hate them.

776
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:53,780
I need, okay, the Lost fans have to wait till February.

777
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,780
Shut up.

778
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,780
They're still Lost fans.

779
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,780
The Lost sucks.

780
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,780
Wait, wait, wait.

781
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:03,560
I do, by the way, have to thank our friends at Pod Culture for sending me 11 episodes of

782
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,060
Heroes so I can get started.

783
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,820
All I have to say, you'll love Peter.

784
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,820
He's the bomb.

785
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,820
You'll love him.

786
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,820
Okay.

787
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,820
All right.

788
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,740
Well, back to the story.

789
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,100
There's a game coming out called Assassin's Creed that's out by Ubisoft.

790
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,540
Well, she sort of spilled the beans.

791
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:29,660
She said, to quote, it's sort of based on the research that's sort of happening now,

792
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,900
but the fact that your genes might be able to hold memory.

793
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,460
And you could argue semantics and say it's instinct, but how does a baby bird know how

794
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,100
to eat a worm as opposed to a cockroach if its parents don't show it?

795
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:46,980
I guess she's talking about genetic memory and all that, but she's just going into all

796
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,220
this stuff about what's in the game, and Ubi hasn't confirmed her diet or anything, but

797
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,340
I just think it's funny that she spilled the stuff they've been trying to hold back.

798
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,740
Well, she probably didn't know any better.

799
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,860
I mean, I have this feeling she probably doesn't read video game blogs in her spare time.

800
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,860
They didn't have her sign an NDA.

801
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:07,220
Or maybe she doesn't realize that she's spilling plot details that weren't ready to be spilled

802
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,220
yet.

803
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,220
It's probably just an innocent mistake.

804
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,220
But it's still funny.

805
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,540
Oh yeah, it's kind of funny.

806
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,740
And my favorite thing about this, I actually get this story from Eurogamer, they are fantastic.

807
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:21,340
I just love that they call it Ass Creed in the title.

808
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:29,940
Well, not exactly off topic here, but I'm officially boycotting Ubisoft games.

809
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,940
Why?

810
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:43,180
Because Ubisoft, their last few games have really blown, and I think back to everything

811
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:48,540
that I've bought from them, I mean, granted, Ghost Recon and Tom Clancy games aren't really

812
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:57,500
my cup of tea, but the stuff for the Wii, Red Steel, Blue, GT sucked, Monster 4x4 sucked,

813
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:02,980
the Wii version of Splinter Cell sucked, Far Cry sucks.

814
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,020
I'm not buying anymore of your games, seriously.

815
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:10,580
Rayman's Ray of the Rapids was okay, but still kind of sucked.

816
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,260
And Shannon Arms wasn't bad.

817
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,260
Didn't they publish that?

818
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,260
They didn't make it, but they published it.

819
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:22,740
They published it, okay, but still though, I think that I'm done with Ubisoft, and looking

820
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:27,580
forward to some of the stuff that they have coming out, like, was it Ghost Recon Advanced

821
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:31,540
Warfighter 2, which, by the way, looking at screenshots of that and the original one,

822
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,260
you can't tell them apart, I will not be buying that game.

823
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:42,700
I am so inviting somebody from Ubisoft to come on this program in the future.

824
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,540
Jeremy Todd 1 says in our chat room, Loki, that's a dumb move.

825
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,340
Boycotting games will cause the Wii to turn out the same way as the GameCube.

826
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,940
No third party support.

827
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,600
If people boycott third party games, then they will stop making games, and the Wii will

828
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,580
die just like the GameCube did.

829
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,960
I agree and I disagree.

830
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,200
I don't think that you should buy a game just to support third party development, but if

831
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,980
Loki thinks the game sucks, he shouldn't have to buy it.

832
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,980
Exactly.

833
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,780
But Loki's just kind of harsh on games, I mean, God, you think GameSpot's bad?

834
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,780
I mean...

835
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:18,080
Hey, listen, listen, I'm not harsh on games, it's just, seriously, Red Steel, I had high

836
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,080
hopes for this game.

837
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,100
You know, it sold the console for me, it was supposed to be like...

838
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,220
Well, now who's fault is it?

839
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,220
You got your hopes up.

840
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:27,960
Well, when I played the game, it seemed fine, but then somewhere between, you know, playing

841
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,680
at E3 and when it came out, they decided to take a giant dump on it, and, you know, and

842
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,600
apparently, you know, the game sucks, and trying to play multiplayer is like playing

843
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,820
the goddamn game with Parkinson's or something, because the fucking remote goes all over the

844
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,820
goddamn place.

845
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,820
So...

846
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:47,060
Take a deep breath in and out.

847
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,060
It's awful.

848
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,380
It's back on track here, Loki, keep going.

849
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,740
Real quick, real quick, Dartick Suya, Loki, Red Steel 2?

850
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,740
It's gonna suck.

851
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,380
I'm not buying it.

852
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,060
It'll just be the same damn fucking engine, okay, they can go back and tweak it and make

853
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:08,460
it a little bit better, but please, you know, take a page from Capcom, listen to the goddamn

854
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,780
feedback from the people that play your games.

855
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:16,240
James Patrick, Red Steel is better than Killzone and Mace Griffin on PS2, Red Steel isn't

856
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,100
that bad.

857
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:23,660
Okay, Killzone on PlayStation 2, that game is fucking old, and, granted, the game itself,

858
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,660
I mean, is probably pretty good, it's just the controls that suck, and that's what's

859
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,980
really bad about it, is the fact that they really fucked up what could have been a good

860
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,980
game.

861
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,940
Black Boy says, I kinda liked Red Steel.

862
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,940
Good, to each their own, but you know what?

863
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,900
There's people out there that are actually gonna put down money for Splinter Cell Double

864
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,440
Agent on the Wii, and I go, why, but, whatever.

865
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:50,260
Go ahead, buy GT and Monster 4x4 for the Wii, because those aren't like old GameCube games

866
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,380
or something that they just re-released and tacked on controls to.

867
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,420
Oh wait, no, they are.

868
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,540
Alright, I see Jamie twiddling her thumbs over there, she's sick of Loki bitching, she's

869
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,660
ready to get to a new story, aren't you?

870
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,660
Aren't you, Dark Sakura?

871
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,500
Alright, well, I have a story about Luminous.

872
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,500
You like Luminous, right?

873
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,500
I like Luminous.

874
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,220
Do you like Luminous on the Xbox 360?

875
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,220
I'll take that as a no.

876
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,220
I haven't played Luminous.

877
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,220
Oh, okay.

878
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:20,940
I was like, I don't know how to answer that, because I like Luminous, and I like the Xbox

879
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,940
360.

880
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,940
Here's the thing.

881
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,220
Luminous on the 360 is great, except for the Xbox 360 controller.

882
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,640
And the fact that, you know, you have all these microtransactions, and the fact that

883
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:35,460
if you own the PSP version, there's really not a lot of reason to get Luminous on 360.

884
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:40,300
But if you don't have a PSP, you really should have Luminous on the 360.

885
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,060
But anyway, there's a reason why I bring this up.

886
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:47,420
Xbox and Microsoft apparently thinks more people should be playing Luminous, and they

887
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:50,060
are going to have an official competition.

888
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:55,860
It's the Xbox Live Arcade Challenge, and it's going to feature Luminous Live starting today,

889
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,660
the 17th, and it's going to run through the 23rd of December.

890
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,740
So if you think you're good at Luminous, specifically the 60-second attack mode, if you can make

891
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,900
a ton of bricks in the 60-second attack mode, I mean, it doesn't take long to try, you should

892
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:14,140
enter this contest, and you might win a 42-inch Hitachi Plasma HD TV.

893
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:20,020
Four runners up will get an HD DVD bundle, a wireless headset, and the 360 wireless racing

894
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,020
wheel.

895
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:26,220
A hundred ranking players, like the next hundred ranking players, will get 500 Microsoft Points

896
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:31,720
tokens to be redeemed for Xbox Live imagery, which I'm assuming means you can't buy games

897
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,380
with it.

898
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,420
Probably because it would, I'm assuming the reason why is because it would screw up the

899
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,220
reimbursement to the creators of the game, which is why they forced you to get imagery

900
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,220
with it.

901
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:45,420
But if you really wanted a Halo theme that you have to pay for or something, I guess,

902
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,020
you know, you could place in the top 100 and get it.

903
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,860
By the way, they're also doing Small Arms, and that is running from the 24th of this

904
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,140
month through the 30th.

905
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,860
So you only have to be in the top 105.

906
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,060
So get to work.

907
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:02,220
I'd like to see some OL Army members win some Xbox Live imagery.

908
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,300
Wouldn't that be fun?

909
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:08,380
Do I have to buy into this competition for Lumenus, because, you know, you have to buy

910
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,900
the game, but I believe everything else you have to purchase.

911
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,140
No, I don't believe so.

912
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,960
They should have had a, you know, a thing that you have to purchase to, like, turn the

913
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,940
game off or something.

914
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,100
The tournament skin or whatever?

915
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,100
The power button skin?

916
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,100
All right, forget it.

917
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,100
Let's keep them moving.

918
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:34,260
Anyways, so, um, God, I hate Lumenus, but Lumenus is great.

919
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:38,140
I love, like, I love Lumenus for PSP.

920
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:43,260
It was my absolute favorite game that came out last year, you know, and I love Mizuguchi.

921
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,060
I think the man's a god.

922
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,100
I forgive him for 99 Nights.

923
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,580
Even I didn't think that game was that bad.

924
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,700
I found the good in 99 Nights, okay?

925
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:56,080
Every extend extra I ran out and bought, but anyway, Lumenus 2 is, like, if you didn't

926
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,420
have Lumenus 1, Lumenus 2 is, like, really good.

927
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,300
And even if you're a fan of Lumenus, Lumenus 2 is really, really good.

928
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,300
It really is.

929
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,380
So, you're just hating on puzzle games, you're hating on everything today.

930
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:10,540
Um, so, if you're looking for some better games to be coming out, the XNA is definitely

931
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:15,300
one way that might happen, especially since now it's allowing a lot of independent developers

932
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:21,300
to create their own Xbox Live Arcade games, or possibly Xbox Live Arcade games, but they're

933
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:27,480
saying that basically the XNA is going to become the YouTube for games, so I have to

934
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,500
ask, are these going to be games that are reruns of shows that were on the night before

935
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:37,480
that I can catch in case I missed, you know, or is it going to be, like, you know, knock-offs

936
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:43,180
of everything, or, you know, I'm going to see Game A with music from Game B or something.

937
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:47,500
Will I see 13-year-old girls at their slumber parties lip-syncing Britney Spears into their

938
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,500
hairdryers?

939
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,900
I mean, is that what XNA is going to do for me?

940
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,100
Is that how it becomes the YouTube of games?

941
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:56,760
Basically, they're just trying to take the YouTube concept and bring it into games, basically

942
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,860
like a community arcade, to be able to share your own games with the whole community.

943
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:04,640
But you have to buy into this community in order to be able to do that, so it's not like

944
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,120
you're really going to break through on this huge scale.

945
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,720
You know, I have to give one of our buddies a plug here.

946
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,300
Our old buddy Bobby Blackwolf over at All Games Radio, I was listening to his show a

947
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,300
little bit before we went live tonight, and he does a lot of in-depth on XNA this week,

948
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,760
because he does certainly more game programming than I've ever done, so he actually downloaded

949
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,640
it and was trying to make a card game in it, so it's kind of interesting to hear about

950
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,840
what the thing will do and won't let you do, and kind of the ease of use in the program.

951
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,920
So he's over at allgames.com if you want to check out his show, since I don't program,

952
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,800
so I don't really see the point in getting XNA.

953
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,760
I mean, is this something you do, Loki?

954
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,760
You're a little more of a dissecting things than I am.

955
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,320
I think I downloaded it, and I'm like, I don't have the fuck to use this, and then I deleted

956
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,320
it.

957
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,540
So yeah, I don't have to pay $99 a year for YouTube, so I don't understand how this...

958
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:53,480
You only have to pay $99, I believe, to play the games on your Xbox 360.

959
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,080
You can distribute them for free using Windows.

960
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:02,400
You can play the games on Windows, and apparently I guess the wired controllers and the wireless

961
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:09,880
ones, once that wireless adapter comes out, all the XNA games will support those controllers.

962
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:15,200
You don't necessarily need to buy into this yet, but I would like to see an open place

963
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:21,600
where you can play some games or download some free arcade games, that'd be nice.

964
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:26,360
Funny Dale says, XNA will never be YouTube because 90% of people are too stupid to use

965
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,360
XNA.

966
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,360
You know what, though?

967
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,920
Could you imagine if they banned stupid people from YouTube?

968
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,120
There'd be no YouTube.

969
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,840
There'd be no more really awful music videos.

970
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,480
I know, it would be something else.

971
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,200
Could you imagine if YouTube made you take an IQ test?

972
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,320
They should make you take an IQ test before you read.

973
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,960
I should make a website called IQTube.

974
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,960
That would be...

975
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,960
You'd better patent that.

976
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:57,920
You know, there's people coming on, so here's my opinion about this, I think this is like,

977
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,080
not right, and you know, people shouldn't really do that, and you know, I just got my

978
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,080
hair done.

979
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:11,760
Britney Spears, I really want you to put on panties, why won't you listen to me, girl?

980
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,760
Britney Spears is listening to you.

981
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,160
She's actually listening to you on YouTube.

982
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:20,440
She's searching for your blog.

983
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,440
Now there's a game I'd like to see in XNA.

984
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,160
Help Britney Spears dress herself.

985
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,160
Why not?

986
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,960
They made Britney Spears dance beat.

987
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,440
I saw the greatest thing, I thought about getting this for you for Christmas.

988
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:41,780
They had it at some stupid jewelry store or whatever, it was a DVR-like game, but it was

989
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,480
to teach you how to cheerlead.

990
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh my god, I saw commercials for that, that was so fucking hilarious.

991
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,320
It's like, okay girls, go!

992
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,320
Pom pom.

993
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,760
Isn't that just like Para Para paradise?

994
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,580
Not really, okay.

995
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:04,320
It's like an exercise video except you're on like a DVR-type mat, so it was funny.

996
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,320
Alright.

997
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,720
Well hey, how about something different?

998
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,720
Sure, like what?

999
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,320
Than cheerleaders, how about release dates?

1000
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,640
Okay, now let's talk about some games we'll actually get to play.

1001
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:22,480
Well, I have our UK release dates, and just as a disclaimer, again, a few weeks ago we

1002
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,800
got a notice that people in other parts of Europe would like to hear the things from

1003
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,800
their areas.

1004
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,960
Haven't found anywhere quite reliable yet, so I'm going to go ahead and give the UK releases

1005
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,960
for this week.

1006
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,960
How's that sound?

1007
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,960
Swell.

1008
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,840
Well, it could be swell, but the swelling eventually goes down.

1009
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,080
Get to the damn release dates.

1010
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,280
Oh come on, that was funny.

1011
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,280
Chris laughed.

1012
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:52,200
Anyway, coming out, oh, stop that, okay, hey, and it's kind of funny because this game's

1013
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,000
coming out on the winter solstice.

1014
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,760
The 21st, we have Sam & Max Episode 2, Situation Comedy for the PC.

1015
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,840
The 22nd, Marvel Ultimate Alliance on Wii, Open Seasons, Star Trek Legacy, Wii Sports

1016
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:14,200
on Christmas Day, which is bizarre, and then a few other to-be-announced ones, The Silent

1017
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:21,000
Hill Origins, Point Blank, Limbo of the Lost, which just sounds very interesting.

1018
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,720
That's it, really not too much else.

1019
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,640
Wow, all right, well, you know, what's to be expected right before Christmas?

1020
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,480
Well, actually, if you're in Japan, you have a lot of other options.

1021
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,600
Xbox 360 over in Japan, again, these Japanese release dates.

1022
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:39,440
Lost Planet coming out on December 21st, Madden NFL 07 if you're a football fan in Japan.

1023
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:45,440
Need for Speed Carbon and Sonic the Hedgehog all making their way to the Xbox 360 on December

1024
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,440
21st.

1025
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:51,260
PlayStation 3 is going to see Armored Core 4 on the 21st, also their version of Need

1026
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:55,000
for Speed Carbon and their version of Sonic the Hedgehog all making their way to the PlayStation

1027
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
3.

1028
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,600
Over on Nintendo Wii, guess what, Need for Speed Carbon, because that game comes out

1029
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,600
everywhere.

1030
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:06,300
We're getting Monster 4x4 World Circuit from Ubisoft, hooray!

1031
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:12,440
On the PlayStation 2, School Love, which is our game name of the week, School Love comes

1032
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,920
out, also a limited edition.

1033
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,720
This game is made by Views, and again, it's a PlayStation 2 game, and of course, what

1034
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:26,140
Japanese release would be incomplete without the anime-looking cute girls in uniforms on

1035
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:29,960
the cover with the name School Love underneath that.

1036
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,560
Dating Sim, right?

1037
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:36,360
I think that's what it looks like, because I'm looking at the little screenshot pictures

1038
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,360
here.

1039
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,360
That's a Dating Sim.

1040
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,360
Yeah, it looks like a Dating Sim.

1041
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:44,400
So if you have ever wanted to date school girls in the comfort of your own home...

1042
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,000
I actually own a Dating Sim.

1043
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Really?

1044
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,480
Well, okay, it has a Dating Sim, and it sort of, um, I have the Rival Schools Evolution,

1045
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,360
or I should say, uh, Shiri to Justice Kakuen.

1046
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,160
Um, I bought the Evolution disc, I paid like $90 for that, but it has a high school simulator

1047
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:03,240
in there, where a Batsu asks you out on a date for your birthday, and then you play

1048
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,520
sort of Rival Schools DDR.

1049
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,520
It's really bizarre.

1050
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,280
I have Yowie Dating Sims, those are always fun.

1051
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,160
The only Dating Sim I ever played was a DS game called Sprung, and it's the biggest piece

1052
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,000
of shit game I've ever played in my life.

1053
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,200
It was a piece of shit.

1054
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,200
If you own Sprung, burn it.

1055
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,200
Actually...

1056
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,320
Watching it on fire will be more entertaining than playing the game.

1057
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:27,660
I have one more Sim game, like the Interactive Sims, as I have, um, one of the Evangelion

1058
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,660
games on Saturn.

1059
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,660
Alright.

1060
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,660
The rest...

1061
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,660
Is that the porn one?

1062
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,660
Not the porn one.

1063
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,760
I gotta get to the rest of the releases, because there's some big stuff in here.

1064
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:40,840
Secret of Evangelion, speaking of Evangelion, Secret of Evangelion coming out from Jinx,

1065
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:46,580
also in Japan on PlayStation 2, and, uh, Squeenix fanboys, prepare thy selves, here comes your

1066
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:53,040
fanboy boner, Seiken Detsetsu 4, also known as Dawn of Mana, December 21st, this week.

1067
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,400
I need new pants.

1068
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,600
There goes her boner.

1069
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:05,800
On the Nintendo DS, you have a cute pouch, DS Lite, oh, these are like just little pouches,

1070
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:12,160
I think, uh, Angel Pocket with DS Diary, lots of little things coming out there for the

1071
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:19,620
DS accessory-wise, and the sweet pouch, also coming from Konami, but get this, if you cannot

1072
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:27,400
get enough hamster action on your Nintendo DS, Hamster 2 Kurasao is coming out on the

1073
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:36,240
Nintendo DS in Japan, it's the cutest cover, and look at the cute cover, oh god, hold on,

1074
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:42,720
this is great radio, this is great radio, uh, let me post that link in our chat room

1075
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:47,000
there if you folks would like to check out the love hamsters there on the DS, they can't,

1076
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,360
but seriously, can one of our Japanese listeners, because I know we have some, can one of them

1077
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,200
email me and please tell me what is up with hamsters?

1078
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,680
You know, I think I want to buy- Apparently they're good for the ass.

1079
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:05,480
I think, sadly, that trend was probably started in America.

1080
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:11,280
I think I'm going to actually buy one of those DS hamster games, because they have the hamsters

1081
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:18,160
ones, unfortunately it's by Ubisoft, so much for your boycott, they have hamster's life

1082
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:23,320
or whatever, and you get to create their own little house and stuff, so I might buy that

1083
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,680
just to try it out.

1084
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:29,240
I do have a rebuttal for the chat room, by the way, don't you know Cyberbots is Capcom's

1085
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,600
number one game?

1086
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,600
Alright.

1087
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,400
It was a quote in Puzzle Fighter.

1088
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,440
There's still more games I gotta get to, this is such a huge week in Japan, it's slow for

1089
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:45,120
us but for Japan it's huge, they're getting on the PSP, every extend extra, which we've

1090
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,520
had here for a couple weeks, it's pretty good, if you like pretty things you should check

1091
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:53,320
out every extend extra, and Need for Speed Carbon, and Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops

1092
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,720
coming out in Japan this week on the 21st.

1093
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:04,800
Over on the Dreamcast, oh no, I'm sorry, those dates are in February, nevermind, you gotta

1094
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:09,480
ways out, but you will get new games on the 22nd of February, and that's all I care to

1095
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,360
share with you at this time.

1096
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:15,780
If you're looking for games in the United States this week, you're not gonna have much

1097
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,960
to choose from, actually.

1098
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:27,000
Coming out on the PSP we have Metal Slug Anthology, also Bubble Bobble Evolution, and then on

1099
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,760
Playstation 2 Brave the search for Spirit Dancer, which is delayed since like August,

1100
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:42,520
and on PC Paws and Claws Pet School, where you get to cure animals by petting them, and

1101
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,200
I swear to god, oh my god, cute!

1102
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,200
That's all you do!

1103
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,800
Oh, you're dying from cancer, my petting will save you!

1104
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,920
That's basically this game, I swear to god.

1105
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:00,680
And then on the Xbox 360 you're getting Rapala Trophies, because if you really want a really

1106
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:07,080
crappy-ass fishing game, there you go, and then Mad Catz, the Xbox Live Arcade Retro

1107
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:12,320
Stick, which, people say it's awesome for Xbox Live Arcade games, but I think it looks

1108
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:16,840
like a giant piece of crap, so, whatever you wanna, if you wanna buy it, great.

1109
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:20,400
Shouldn't you try it before you pass judgement on it here on this program?

1110
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,720
It just looks awful, dude, it looks, I'm not buying an arcade stick for just a couple Xbox

1111
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,720
Live Arcade games.

1112
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,600
I will build my own stick before I go and buy one.

1113
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,160
But that's it!

1114
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:40,400
Yeah, well, I have some game news, and this is fun game news, there's gonna be a new Final

1115
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:53,080
Fantasy Tactics on PSP, and they're also doing a sequel to the Game Boy Advance Final Fantasy

1116
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,080
Tactics Advance.

1117
01:00:55,080 --> 01:01:01,160
So they actually made the announcement in Shonen Jump, they were still waiting on some

1118
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,360
details, but the one coming out on PSP is actually called Final Fantasy Tactics Shishi

1119
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:13,120
Senso, meaning it's, they're also saying it's gonna be cel-shaded, have new jobs, and is

1120
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,880
a sequel to the PSX one.

1121
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,160
Oh, okay, because I heard it was like a direct port of the PlayStation one, but it sounds

1122
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,280
like they're enhancing it, like a lot of these, you know.

1123
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,280
It's a sequel.

1124
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,280
Huh, interesting.

1125
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,280
I'll be cool.

1126
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,280
I mean, if it's the same one with more stuff, then that will still be fun, because Final

1127
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:34,600
Fantasy Tactics, even though I'm not a fan of tactics games, I think it's cool, I like

1128
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,360
watching people play them.

1129
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:42,520
And then the other one is, that's going to be the sequel to the Game Boy Advance title,

1130
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,280
and they're not sure what pla- it's not listed what platform it's gonna be on, but it's called

1131
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:57,600
Final Fantasy Tactics A2 Fuketsu no Gurimor, Gurimore, I think, Gurimore, yeah, I guess.

1132
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,600
So yeah.

1133
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,600
Alright.

1134
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,600
Well.

1135
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,600
Yeah!

1136
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,600
I like Final Fantasy Tactics.

1137
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,600
Don't laugh at me.

1138
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,080
I'm not a big fan of tactical games, usually, but Final Fantasy Tactics, you know, because

1139
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:12,880
I'm such a Final Fantasy whore, it allows me to cross over into the tactical side.

1140
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:17,200
Well, since Dark Sakura brought up the PSP, I suppose this will be a good time for us

1141
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:22,520
to talk about that big news in Sony World this week, and by big, I mean their noses,

1142
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,960
for being big, big liars.

1143
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:33,740
If you did not hear yet about the website AllIWantForXmasisapsp.com, seriously, get

1144
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:37,080
out there and read some of the funny shit some of the bloggers wrote about it, because

1145
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:41,520
here's the story of what happened in a nutshell, and we saw this play out throughout this week.

1146
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:47,280
It launched called AllIWantForXmasisapsp.com, and it was basically a blog set up by two

1147
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:53,680
kids who surprisingly looked a lot older than the kids they were supposed to be, but whatever.

1148
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:59,000
They were kids that really wanted a PSP, and they made these videos and put them on YouTube,

1149
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,800
you know, singing, all I want is a PSP, da da da, and they were like, you know, dancing

1150
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:08,600
around with a PSP and looking really stupid, basically.

1151
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:14,040
And what happened is some guy got smart and said, you know, this can't be real.

1152
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:20,280
And so they traced up who registered AllIWantForXmasisapsp.com, and the people who registered it was this company

1153
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,920
called Zippatone.

1154
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,080
Zippatone is one of Sony's marketing firms.

1155
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:30,200
So people, once this caught wind on the game blogs, people started spamming the crap out

1156
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:35,980
of this site, you know, liars, we found you out, hi Zippatone, da da da da, and just all

1157
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,720
this nasty, nasty shit written in these comments.

1158
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,440
And if you missed all this action play out, sorry, the site's gone because it's just a

1159
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,440
big white page now.

1160
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,800
But what happened later in the week, Sony fessed up and said something to the effect

1161
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:53,000
of blah, blah, blah, you caught us, blah, blah, blah, I guess we were too funky fresh

1162
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,800
for you, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, continuing to make themselves look stupid.

1163
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:02,920
Because the problem I think most people had with AllIWantForXmasisapsp.com is not necessarily

1164
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:06,920
the fact that they were being lied to, because there's been previous viral marketing campaigns

1165
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,720
that were kind of, you know, fun, like the I Love Bees and stuff like that, but the problem

1166
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:18,800
with AllIWantForXmasisapsp.com is they made your typical gamer look like a dumbass.

1167
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:23,780
I mean just a complete and utter, and like I seriously, like when I watched these videos

1168
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:29,240
I felt my intelligence be insulted, like this is supposed to win me over, this is really

1169
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,560
what marketing people think gamers are.

1170
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:36,240
And for Sony to come out and say, I guess we were too funky fresh for you, that's like

1171
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:42,820
when grandma says something about like, oh wow, that was really the bee's knees trying

1172
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,040
to be cool like you.

1173
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:48,800
I'm going like, you people really don't get it.

1174
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:54,260
And the thing too about it is like they're all using, they had a bunch of fake comments

1175
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:59,200
on there too by people saying, oh this is the best site ever, you know, and then like

1176
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:06,880
using number two for every time they said two, and just trying to fake that late speaker

1177
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:13,440
or whatever on their website, and why the fuck do they create a website, because other

1178
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:21,400
than they get buzz and stuff about the PSP, but it's just, to create a fake website with

1179
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,800
a bunch of people saying, oh the PSP is awesome and stuff like that, it's just really dirty,

1180
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,960
I don't know, it just seems like, you know, I don't see Nintendo making fake websites

1181
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:34,060
going, oh the Wii is awesome and stuff, you don't need that kind of, you don't need to

1182
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:39,600
make up that publicity, you know, it's just the PSP and the PlayStation 3 have been having

1183
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,400
a big problem with their marketing campaigns.

1184
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,680
Alright, I got some comments from the chat room I have to read here, we have a, Crispy

1185
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:50,080
says, least they fessed up, well you know what, I kind of feel like they had to fess

1186
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,700
up, I mean seriously, Sony was caught with not only their pants down, but their boxers

1187
01:05:54,700 --> 01:06:00,480
down too, so the world could see what an incredibly tiny, tiny penis Sony had when it came to

1188
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,860
the PSP, because seriously that's kind of what it boils down to right now, is that Sony

1189
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:09,920
is probably a little pissed that people are all hyped about Wii and DS and da da da da

1190
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:16,160
da, and that there wasn't a legitimate blog out there for PSP rabid fandom, so they created

1191
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,160
this.

1192
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,880
And let's see, Funny Dale in our chat room says, I hate to break the news to you guys,

1193
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,800
but every video game commercial makes gamers look like a bunch of losers.

1194
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,280
Eh, what Cris, you say that's not true?

1195
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,840
That's not true, I don't get that, I don't get that when I see those.

1196
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:36,000
It depends, again it depends on what commercial I'm looking at, like I kind of like the Wii

1197
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,680
commercials, but then again the Wii appeals to those that are not gamers, so.

1198
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:41,680
I think.

1199
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,680
Yeah, I don't know.

1200
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:43,680
Well let's look at.

1201
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,800
I can see where he's getting that comment from though, it has taken the society a long

1202
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,540
time to get gamers, you know what I mean?

1203
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:56,400
I think it really, like the PlayStation commercials, for both the PSP and the PlayStation 3, I

1204
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:01,440
never really got them, and I always knew that they had a problem with their marketing firms,

1205
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,840
because look at the way they're advertised, like the PSP, they have two stick figures,

1206
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:11,040
or not stick figures, but like, you know, sketch drawings of like dust bunnies or whatever,

1207
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:17,340
like talking about random shit, you know, and they're all PSP, it's like nuts, it's

1208
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:21,720
like you can play outside or something like that, it doesn't make any sense, nor do the

1209
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:26,640
PlayStation 3 commercials, they're in the room with the PlayStation 3, you know, making

1210
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:31,640
a baby doll cry, it makes no sense, it's like, what the fuck is this?

1211
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:37,880
And it really, it doesn't show off what the games do, or what the system does, it's just

1212
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:43,360
like this commercial that you talk about, but yet you don't know what it's about, whereas

1213
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,820
they have like Call of Duty 3 or something that shows actual gameplay, or the Wii that

1214
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:51,520
shows actual gameplay, just show me the games, show me the games!

1215
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:57,560
Alright, Flaming Bozo in our chat room says, no, the commercials for gaming colleges make

1216
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,560
us look stupid.

1217
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,840
Oh, yeah, those are awful.

1218
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,720
Okay, I get it, thank you for citing a commercial, you're right, that one does make gamers look

1219
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,640
pretty stupid, but I think people need to get the concept of, and this is one of those

1220
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:10,920
things I feel like, you know, at least in the Wii marketing, and again, I'm not talking

1221
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,700
about the systems, I'm talking about the marketing, in the Wii marketing it's kind of got that

1222
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:21,880
gamers are everybody, who enjoys movies, everybody, who listens to music, everybody, shouldn't

1223
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,120
games be accessible to everybody too, right, kind of thing?

1224
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,120
I don't know.

1225
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,120
Definitely.

1226
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,120
One would hope.

1227
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,640
Anyway, real quick question, then we'll get to another story here, but I want to go around

1228
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:36,960
the room and ask, yes or no, and any other thing you want to say, Sony should fire any

1229
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,400
company related to their marketing right now and start with new companies around the board,

1230
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,960
in other words, Sony should just axe everything to do with their marketing right now and start

1231
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,840
anew in 2007, yes or no?

1232
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:52,840
I think it would be a good idea to not only get new marketers, I mean, get some people

1233
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:57,640
that actually know how to market this stuff, like the people behind Burger King, or even

1234
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:02,000
like Geico, just like people that come up with really creative marketing campaigns,

1235
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,760
great, that's great, get some of those people to help you out.

1236
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:10,760
Also get your higher ups to shut the fuck up, because they keep ruining any good marketing

1237
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:15,140
that you do for yourselves, so that's what they need to do, and also I think companies

1238
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:19,440
have a really crazy idea what viral marketing is.

1239
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,940
Jamie, yes or no, Sony needs to fire all their marketers.

1240
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:29,020
To take this from a business point of view, that would actually be pretty damn illogical

1241
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:35,820
to expect them to, because they have contracts set up with these, what they need to do is

1242
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:45,580
have more express control, better QA with what goes on with what's marketed, more involvement

1243
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:51,960
with this, let's look at this realistically, because honestly, anything that their marketing

1244
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:57,080
firms come up with, doesn't Sony have to approve?

1245
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:03,680
So somebody at Sony approved these, they need to find whoever was in charge of approving

1246
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,120
it and fire them.

1247
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:14,480
Or structural reorganization, we don't like to talk about people getting killed or fired

1248
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,840
or anything, but structural reorganization is a need.

1249
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,280
Or hire me.

1250
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,280
Would you save Sony?

1251
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,600
I am brilliant, I would save Sony's ass.

1252
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:27,600
Oh God, no, I'm sorry, I love you Jamie, but damn, it would be like PlayStation 3 starts

1253
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,400
fires, fire, fire, fire.

1254
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:34,640
No, no, no, no, it would be PlayStation 3 presented by Sega.

1255
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:41,480
Here's what they really need to do, and they really need to just focus on what makes them

1256
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,620
good, what makes the system good.

1257
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:50,200
It plays games, it's great for gaming and stuff, maybe show off the 6 axis controller

1258
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:55,480
and how it's used in games and stuff like that, maybe just focus on what the system

1259
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:00,200
offers, instead of just these really cryptic fucking commercials.

1260
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,560
Also the PSP, they need to fucking get some good marketing behind this thing because right

1261
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:08,960
now, they were hoping Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops was good, it was like a system seller,

1262
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:13,160
but I don't think anyone really knows what's a good game on the PSP.

1263
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,160
Well maybe word needs to get out there that maybe it's Metal Gear, and we're trying not

1264
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,640
to be like a Sony hate fest, I don't know, maybe some of you guys are, I don't want to

1265
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:24,120
see this be like a total Sony hate fest because like I said, I love Luminous 2, there are

1266
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:30,080
good things I like about the PSP, it's just that boy, your marketing sucks right now.

1267
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,680
Some of their commercials and print materials have been decent, and so if I were to answer

1268
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:39,320
this question, I'd say whoever was behind this whole thing, definitely structural reorganization,

1269
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:42,400
but when it comes to, some of their marketing hasn't been bad.

1270
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,920
What happened to the really cool marketing that they had at E3, like the Play Beyond

1271
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:46,920
stuff?

1272
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:50,280
That stuff was cool, they should have stuck with that, but see, my marketing scheme for

1273
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:54,440
the PlayStation 3 would start off with fire in the commercial.

1274
01:11:54,440 --> 01:12:03,200
Okay, you know what, Sony needs to hire Jamie to be their Major Nelson, it's Sergeant Sakura.

1275
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:09,000
It would start off with fire, and then there would be some more explosions in the background,

1276
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,600
and then, this Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, your PlayStation 3 will be on fire!

1277
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:22,920
No, no, no, no, no, there'd be a fence somewhere in the background, like a chain link fence,

1278
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:27,840
and there'd be all these really awesome people walking around with PlayStation 3s, and then

1279
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,040
the announcer going, buy a PlayStation 3, dammit!

1280
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:37,720
Alright, I gotta let Chris comment on this being the one who maybe isn't as into consoles

1281
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:42,440
as the rest of us, Sony needs to fire them all, yes or no?

1282
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:46,120
Well, realistically, we all know they're not going to, because like somebody said, I think

1283
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:52,840
it was Jamie, they got contracts, um, I don't think they should get fired, but someone definitely

1284
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:57,880
needs to go, I nominate Jamie for this, someone needs to go in there and like bitch slap them,

1285
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,480
because I think what they're doing is-

1286
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,480
Gladly!

1287
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,480
Yeah, I know.

1288
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm reading chat room and these comments are too good to pass up,

1289
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,240
hold on, let Chris finish your thought.

1290
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,800
Yeah, the chat room upped me, it's okay.

1291
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,800
No, I'm sorry, finish your thought.

1292
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,800
No, no, no, go, go, go, quick!

1293
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:16,800
Okay, Fireboma has an idea for a campaign, and that is a PlayStation 3 campaign would

1294
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:22,640
go something like this, only faggots buy a Wii.

1295
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:27,480
And look, look, I am gay, so I can laugh at that, that is kind of funny, I'm sorry.

1296
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:31,240
If you buy a Wii, that means you like it in the ass.

1297
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:36,720
Xbox, this would be the other commercial, Xbox 360 owners are fat and retarded, you aren't

1298
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:42,520
fat and retarded, are you?

1299
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,560
There it is, Sergeant Fireboma, everybody.

1300
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:50,000
If you have the Wii 60, does it mean that you're a big fat dyke?

1301
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,560
You know, and honestly, even though-

1302
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,840
That means you like fried chicken, and-

1303
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,040
And even though that is so offensive, I would still think that's a better advertisement,

1304
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,120
I would laugh at that.

1305
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:04,160
I know, I would at least laugh at that, like if I saw a commercial come on TV, like you

1306
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:08,640
think I should be offended, you know, being gay and all, but I would probably laugh, like

1307
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:13,200
I'd be all, that's better than the all I want for xmas is a BSP thing.

1308
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,200
I'm laughing so hard, that's great.

1309
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,200
Okay-

1310
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,880
I'm just thinking of the hate mail that's gonna come in.

1311
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,440
New ad scheme, new ad scheme.

1312
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,120
You guys should not be using those words on the internet.

1313
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,120
So what?

1314
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,520
We have a mature rating, so-

1315
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,840
I know, whatever, whatever.

1316
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:32,140
No, the ad scheme would be this, is you just have a black screen, yeah?

1317
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:38,680
And the Playstation 3 shows up, it's like, you want one, we're Sony, kiss our ass!

1318
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:42,000
No, no, no, I got one, I got one, I got one, I got one, I got one, I got one, I got one.

1319
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,200
Buy a Playstation 3 or we will kill you!

1320
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,040
Okay, hold on, alright, we're getting too crazy here, hold on.

1321
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,600
I'm gonna put a call out to the listeners.

1322
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,680
We have a voicemail system, right?

1323
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,600
This is what I would know, this is a homework assignment, and we'll even turn this into

1324
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,600
a giveaway.

1325
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,160
This is it.

1326
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,760
We want you to leave a voicemail, not now, if you're listening live to us on Sunday,

1327
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,320
please don't call now, but call after, you know, when the podcast feed hits, call.

1328
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,760
Leave your best 30-second Sony commercial, okay?

1329
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:16,200
The winner, the one that persuades us to buy a Sony product the most, we will send something

1330
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:20,480
from our prize pool somewhere, so we'll dig something up, I don't know, so-

1331
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,240
Get the paper from Rob's bathroom.

1332
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:29,760
Alright, so anyway, alright, so get to it, leave your 30-second voicemails, and we'll

1333
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,440
play our favorites when we come back live here on Orange Launch Radio.

1334
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,640
Alright, we gotta get to more news.

1335
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,640
Where the hell were we?

1336
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,640
Dude, my turn!

1337
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,640
Moving on.

1338
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,480
No, no, Loki had one thing real quick, I think.

1339
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,480
Well, too bad.

1340
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,480
Yes, my turn.

1341
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,480
Okay.

1342
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,200
So anyways, speaking of this viral marketing, because we kind of derailed that whole train

1343
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:53,640
there in a second, the Federal Trade Commission actually on Monday said that the companies

1344
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:59,640
would be required to disclose ties of word-of-mouth marketing campaigns, these fake grassroots

1345
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:05,640
efforts dubbed astro-surfing by critics, hire people to endorse products as themselves rather

1346
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:09,440
than respective companies.

1347
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:13,680
So actually it's pretty cool that they're doing this, and I do think it's something,

1348
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:18,360
because I always see when they're advertising different games and stuff, all these viral

1349
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:23,380
marketing campaigns, and really, I don't think people know what viral marketing is.

1350
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:28,060
You're not supposed to know that you're being marketed to, not by saying, look, I'm a site

1351
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:34,740
called I love such-and-such game or something, I love Barbie Horse Adventures, and having

1352
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,840
a bunch of people saying, yeah, that game rocks.

1353
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,140
That's not viral marketing.

1354
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,600
That is basically lying to people.

1355
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:45,420
A viral marketing campaign is saying, Barbie's saying, oh, come try out my new horse game,

1356
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:47,400
get an email like that or something.

1357
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,360
That is a little bit different.

1358
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,640
But basically they need to...

1359
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,160
I want to get emails from Barbie.

1360
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,640
Where do I sign up for that?

1361
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,760
Be a dirty whore.

1362
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,320
Or alternate reality gaming.

1363
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:04,720
That's another good marketing campaign, because it gets people involved and it's kind of some

1364
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:08,400
mystery to it, and I don't know, I think it's a really good way to do that.

1365
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:18,320
I Love Bees, the whole Xbox 360 campaign that they did, the Hex 168 or whatever it was,

1366
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:22,720
that's good marketing, but I guess when you have retarded marketing companies working

1367
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,600
for you, that's all they can come up with.

1368
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:28,720
By the way, I forgot to give you the voicemail number, speaking of a good lapse of judgment,

1369
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,720
1-877-GAME-OLR.

1370
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,240
That's toll free in the US and Canada.

1371
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:36,600
Sorry UK listeners, you'd have to pay, but you could do it the free way if you use Skype.

1372

Click on interact with us.

1376
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,760
Hey, I thought of another idea.

1377
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,880
What's that?

1378
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,880
Ad campaign.

1379
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,200
Going back to that.

1380
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,200
Okay.

1381
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,840
A giant crab comes out clutching a PlayStation 3.

1382
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,720
I would laugh at that, that would be awesome.

1383
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:01,280
And the slogan is, buy a PS3, get crabs.

1384
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,640
I think if Sony could laugh at themselves like that, they'd earn a lot of respect back

1385
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,640
in this community.

1386
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,240
If they could point and laugh at themselves like that, parade that guy back out there

1387
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:14,440
who said that giant enemy crab thing the first time, make a big joke of it.

1388
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:19,160
You know what, I think the gaming culture would kind of laugh at that and forgive them

1389
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,160
a little bit.

1390
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,880
Rob, give the number out again, please.

1391
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,600
Yes, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

1392
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,920
You're welcome, chat room.

1393
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:27,920
All right.

1394
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,200
So hey, my turn, right?

1395
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,120
Sure, yes, now you can go.

1396
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,120
Okay.

1397
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:40,400
Well, speaking of the PlayStation 3, buy our crabs, they put out the 1.31 update, which

1398
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:46,360
adds support for Final Fantasy XI for all you weird addicts.

1399
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:50,880
The update on the US page does not state what is involved in it, but however the Japanese

1400
01:18:50,880 --> 01:19:01,520
site does, and based on a rudimentary translation, it's the installation of the hard disk PlayStation

1401
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:08,280
2, so basically the hard drive attachment is going to be compatible.

1402
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:14,880
So that means you get Nobunaga's Ambition online on Final Fantasy XI.

1403
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:19,680
Now they're saying that it's not quite working on the Japanese site for the PlayStation 2

1404
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:25,520
system data, but the speculation is that you may need to actually have the games it goes

1405
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,520
with to do the download.

1406
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,680
So that's kind of neat that all you'll have to do is download some stuff to your hard

1407
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,560
drive and it'll work?

1408
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,560
That's the theory.

1409
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:37,920
So maybe I can play my BeatMania.

1410
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:42,400
My question would be, though, would you really want to play this game on the PlayStation

1411
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:47,840
3, because I don't know if you guys have seen this video on Dig this week, it hit Dig and

1412
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,920
it was all over the internet, but some guy actually made a side-by-side comparison of

1413
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:58,000
playing Final Fantasy X on the PlayStation 2 and on the PlayStation 3, and honestly,

1414
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,840
it looks like absolute horseshit on the PlayStation 3.

1415
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,880
And they show you what the PS3 one looks like, I'm playing it in the studio here.

1416
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,760
You can see the PS3 is on one side of the screen and the PS2 is on the other side of

1417
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:08,760
the screen.

1418
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,400
Let me go to a section here that has a face, and you can really tell the difference.

1419
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:16,800
You can see how the PS3 one is kind of faded out, it looks a little washed, and you can

1420
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,560
see, especially when they get into the shots, see, look at the shots of Yuna's face here.

1421
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:25,160
You can see all these jaggedies there, you can see all this stuff.

1422
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:32,320
The one thing in defense of the PlayStation 3 side is the colors seem a bit more normalized,

1423
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,720
not overcontrasted.

1424
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,720
Right.

1425
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:38,740
So, anyway, what basically is going on here is that they're saying this could be really

1426
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:44,120
fixed with just a simple firmware update, honestly, that's all they really had to do

1427
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:47,440
to get rid of the jaggedies and the artifacts that are there, but nothing yet.

1428
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,680
I guess it was one of those things that was overlooked to get the system out on time.

1429
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:58,840
Well, I do think, I'd have to see other games to compare it, honestly, but I do like, some

1430
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:04,120
of the backgrounds looked more washed out, but I think for skin tones, it was clearer,

1431
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:07,200
the skin tones were more realistic and accurate.

1432
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,200
Interesting.

1433
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,760
That's what forgiving the most of the internet was.

1434
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:14,080
Well, then again, I'm taking it from an artist's point of view, there are more jaggedies.

1435
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,840
Well, let's also, you know, it's YouTube, it's not going to be the best quality, but

1436
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:22,480
look, you got a PS3, you should go home and try for yourself and let us know.

1437
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,480
You want to borrow my Final Fantasy X?

1438
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,040
I have Final Fantasy X!

1439
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,600
I just went checking.

1440
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:34,440
God, Rob, no, but no, seriously though, you know, actually that would be good because

1441
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,080
if I, all I have to do is switch my channels, you know, we actually did that, Dan and I

1442
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:42,800
did that a long time ago, with our Saturn and the Playstation for Castlevania Symphony

1443
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,200
of the Night.

1444
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,200
Interesting.

1445
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:50,280
It turned out that the Saturn version had better sound, and the 2D effects were better,

1446
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,640
but the Playstation had better 3D, so that was our comparison.

1447
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:56,200
I could do that again, try it with other games.

1448
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,200
That might be kind of fun.

1449
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:00,680
Yeah, I'd have to find duplicates of some of the games, but I could do that.

1450
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,440
Oops, sorry, I keep playing the video there in the background, I was trying to get the

1451
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:09,800
link there for chat because they do this little, like, unnecessary intro to the thing on YouTube,

1452
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,800
but whatever.

1453
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,520
Anyway, there, oh, dammit, I reposted the hamster thing in chat.

1454
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,720
Son of a bitch.

1455
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:18,720
Hamsters?

1456
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:19,720
Go hamster!

1457
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:26,120
Damn it, YouTube, let me make sure that copied.

1458
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:31,680
This is great radio, boys and girls, what can we say, we are taping live and this is

1459
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,680
what happens.

1460
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,680
There was a ton of time, there was a final fan in the game.

1461
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,680
Ah, shut up.

1462
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,680
What?

1463
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:37,680
No.

1464
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,680
Let's try that again.

1465
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,680
There it is, there's the link the chat room's been begging for.

1466
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,000
Oh, god.

1467
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Alright.

1468
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,800
Please, let's move on.

1469
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:49,600
Hey, ShadowCharlie has also pointed out that you can play as Maria in the Saturn version,

1470
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,080
but you can also play as Richter and he's not an easy kill in that one.

1471
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:57,600
And, Dan just unlocked Richter and Maria mode in, um, Portrait of Ruin.

1472
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,600
Really?

1473
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,000
And it's, like, TurboGrafx Maria.

1474
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Huh.

1475
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
It's pretty cool.

1476
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I'll say that.

1477
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I'll say that.

1478
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Anyways.

1479
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,800
Um, so, you know, it's awesome that you get to play as, um, or play Final Fantasy XI on

1480
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:10,880
your Playstation 3.

1481
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,920
Unfortunately, you can't do that if you're in the UK because it's not out yet.

1482
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:18,920
And the speculation is, it might not be out for quite a while.

1483
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:23,240
And there might actually be a delay on the March, um, date.

1484
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:27,240
And they're saying that it's possibly delayed to May, if not September.

1485
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:34,760
Um, according to, uh, let's see, Computer and Video Games, that website.

1486
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:38,440
Um, so, what did Sony have to say about this?

1487
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:46,160
Well, actually, um, Sony's Computer Entertainment Europe, David Reeves, he said, uh, well, we're

1488
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:50,600
still on schedule with the launch, um, for the Playstation 3 in March, throughout the

1489
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:56,000
PAL territories, and all speculation otherwise is without foundation.

1490
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,720
Um, it should be noted, though, this is the same guy that was saying, um, that they're

1491
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:09,840
on track for releasing, actually, in 2006, Spring, um, he says that they were on track

1492
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:10,840
at that time.

1493
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:19,000
I'm basically also saying that, um, I don't know, but it's pretty funny, though, uh, you

1494
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,600
know, this guy is basically just giving people the assumption that the thing was coming out

1495
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:30,520
in Spring of 2006, and then when it passed that date, they saw, oh, by the way, it's

1496
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:35,800
not coming out at that time, so who knows if it's coming out in March, and by the, looking

1497
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,040
at how many units they're producing, supposedly they're done with the bottleneck with the

1498
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:44,920
Blu-ray, um, diodes, but if that's not the case, it might not be coming out.

1499
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:48,680
I don't see why the UK won't be getting us on time, I'm sorry, but this guy's word isn't

1500
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,160
enough for me.

1501
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,160
Sorry.

1502
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,760
My, my thing would be, is they're gonna get it in March, but it's definitely not gonna

1503
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,760
be as major.

1504
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:56,760
It's gonna be like our launch.

1505
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:57,760
Yeah.

1506
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,760
Yeah.

1507
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:02,200
Have fun, our friends over the UK who are gonna be waiting for this system.

1508
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:06,560
Alright, one thing I know you guys look forward to every week is DarkSakura's website of the

1509
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:10,440
week, because she surfs the internet up and down, and up, up, down, down, left, right,

1510
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:15,480
left, right, all over the internet, to, uh, whatever, to find a website just for you,

1511
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:20,520
it's her website of the week, and here it is, boys and girls, DarkSakura, take it away.

1512
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:27,040
My website of the week is a fun one, actually, it's earthcam.com, because I love looking

1513
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:33,440
at different webcams all over the world, and, no seriously, you can look at, you know, London,

1514
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:40,520
Moscow, Japan, you know, anywhere, it's basically different, um, webcams in different locations

1515
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,520
across the world.

1516
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,520
That's kinda cool.

1517
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,520
I think it's really cool.

1518
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,360
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna check that out, because one thing I've been playing with a

1519
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:49,960
lot this week is Google Earth, which is one of my favorite programs ever, it lets you

1520
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:54,300
look at satellite photography and zoom in and out, anywhere in the world, anywhere.

1521
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:59,240
One of the ones I'm looking at right now is in Meppen, Germany, um, that's of an ice skating

1522
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,240
rink.

1523
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:04,720
I think that's very cool, but it's just basically linked to different international webcams.

1524
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:09,200
There's actually a webcam, I hope that they've got it back up, but it was in, uh, New Orleans

1525
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,620
in the French Quarter, they used to have a cam outside one of the, uh, the bars.

1526
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:14,620
You know what's funny?

1527
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:18,200
My friend was on that cam once and sent a picture from it, this was years ago, before

1528
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,200
you know all the disaster.

1529
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,200
Yeah.

1530
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,200
Isn't that funny?

1531
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:28,200
And, um, but some of the other places listed here, there's one, um, in, um, Erfurt, Germany,

1532
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:36,680
and, um, a few in Russia, one in Weatherford, Texas, uh, Peak District, England, Jerusalem,

1533
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:37,880
Miami.

1534
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:38,880
It's really cool.

1535
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:44,760
I think it's very neat, and it's sort of, you know, I don't think there's any in any

1536
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,760
bathrooms.

1537
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,960
No, no locker room webcams, Chris, sorry.

1538
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:53,480
But, but I think it's a very, a very good idea, another way to, to bring us, you know,

1539
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:54,480
sort of closer.

1540
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:59,900
Uh, GS68 in our chatroom says, we need an OLR webcam, and I'll tell you guys, uh, it

1541
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:04,120
actually looks like it probably will happen if you're all good boys and girls for Christmas.

1542
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:07,880
Uh, there will be a cam coming back to the show in 2007, that's all I can say for now.

1543
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,840
I'll be doing the Dance of the Seven Veils in the background.

1544
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,840
Jamie doesn't like to be it.

1545
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:12,840
As in sitting in a chair.

1546
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:13,840
Jamie doesn't like to be seen.

1547
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:17,560
But we're trying to, the problem is, the studio we're in now is a lot smaller than any place

1548
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:18,560
we were before.

1549
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,360
There's a lot less people and weird stuff going on.

1550
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,860
When I say studio, I mean spare bedroom, as opposed to the living room at Loki and I's

1551
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:24,860
old apartment.

1552
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:25,860
Now we're in a spare bedroom.

1553
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:29,840
So it's, um, kind of tough for us to situate a webcam here where you can actually see everything.

1554
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,280
But I'm thinking I know a good place where you can put a cam where you can see most of

1555
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,280
the action.

1556
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,280
So we'll see.

1557
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,280
You have a beautiful self.

1558
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:39,680
When, when you show up, which you need to show up more often, miss, miss things.

1559
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,680
I'm coming up from the South Bay, I come up as often as I can.

1560
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,680
All right.

1561
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,680
We appreciate it.

1562
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:45,680
All right.

1563
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:48,040
Thank you, boys and girls, Stark Sakura.

1564
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,040
Give it up.

1565
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,160
All right.

1566
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:51,160
Let's go to some more news.

1567
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,100
It's kind of in other types of game news, not about games themselves, but an interesting

1568
01:27:55,100 --> 01:28:02,400
program going on in Oakland, the SF Gate newspaper, or, I'm sorry, is this a newspaper or just

1569
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,400
a website?

1570
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:07,680
Or, I believe it's like an alternative press style thing.

1571
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:13,200
The SF Gate is mentioning that you can go to Fruitvale Elementary School in Oakland,

1572
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:18,120
where the war against improper toys drive is going on.

1573
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:24,760
What is happening is that they will, what you can do, you can take your replica shotguns,

1574
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:31,760
rifles, pistols, whatever, and you can trade them in for books and family friendly toys.

1575
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:36,440
Now how this plays out is that you can also take your violent video games.

1576
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:39,340
You want to get rid of, you know, Gears of War.

1577
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:43,040
You want to get rid of, you know, any of those, you know, shoot them up to style games.

1578
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:47,640
You can actually trade this in as well.

1579
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,640
What's that?

1580
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,280
What about my Jeff Striker action figure?

1581
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:53,680
I dare you to take it to the school and find out.

1582
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:56,060
If you do, please tape it so we can YouTube it.

1583
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:59,080
That's all I'm going to say.

1584
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:03,080
That address, by the way, 3200 Boston Avenue in Oakland.

1585
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:04,560
That's right by 580.

1586
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,960
Are they going to send all these improper toys to the island of misfit toys by chance?

1587
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:14,760
They need the island of misfit sex toys.

1588
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,080
Not said what they're going to do with it.

1589
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,080
Sorry.

1590
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,480
They're going to burn it in effigy.

1591
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:24,400
So, anyways, this is actually pretty interesting.

1592
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:31,060
Speaking of games and stuff, improper, Capcom's revamping their multiplayer.

1593
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:35,320
We actually ran a story, was it last week, where they were fixing the small text issues.

1594
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:41,280
Well now they're kind of going off of some more of their user feedback and fixing the

1595
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:47,680
multiplayer including some of the lobbies and matchmaking and stuff like that.

1596
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:53,800
So I'm glad to see a company actually listening to the complaints and maybe suggestions from

1597
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:58,560
their users so that in turn, you know, they create a better product.

1598
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,560
So that's excellent.

1599
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,560
Cannot wait.

1600
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:05,960
It's going to be probably one of the only good 360 games coming out in January.

1601
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:11,520
Has anybody ever heard of the GP32X, sorry, the GP2X?

1602
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,520
Yes.

1603
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:13,520
Okay.

1604
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:18,160
Well basically this one is- Okay, no, I haven't.

1605
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:22,120
What this is, it's a Linux-based handheld console.

1606
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:25,440
It's for movies, games, music.

1607
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:29,800
You can develop and run your own software, run MAME on it.

1608
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:34,160
It's supposed to be pretty versatile, well it's actually getting its first major game.

1609
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:40,120
It's getting a game called Payback, which is a crime caper game that was originally

1610
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:44,780
on the Game Boy Advance in 2004.

1611
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:50,320
It's a top-down action, 11 cities, 50 missions, updated 3D graphics, sound special effects,

1612
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,640
custom jukebox mode so you can put your own soundtrack on it.

1613
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:58,400
And it'll actually- Now again, this is for the UK.

1614
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:02,480
It's going to be £22.99.

1615
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:07,680
Think Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2, that type of game.

1616
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:08,680
Huh.

1617
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:09,680
Interesting.

1618
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:12,760
I did not remember, I think this handheld was talked about on an earlier show but I

1619
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:13,760
kind of forgot about it.

1620
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,120
Well it's interesting they have a Linux handheld because it's funny because they try to put

1621
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,960
Linux on all the other handhelds.

1622
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:19,960
And the toaster.

1623
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,760
So it's kind of humorous to me to hear about a Linux handheld.

1624
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,760
I don't know why.

1625
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:24,760
I think it's a good idea.

1626
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,440
I'd actually love to get my hands on that.

1627
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,280
Yeah, I mean I would like to see the presence of this increase.

1628
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:38,960
Well if anyone wants to see the website on this game, go to gp2x.co.uk slash payback.html.

1629
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:43,640
It's got a movie file up on there, a bit more about the game, it has some stuff on the system.

1630
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:49,560
Yeah, actually I remember seeing the system at E3 a couple years back.

1631
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,560
This is pretty cool.

1632
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:55,120
Linux is the- Their logo is like a penguin, right?

1633
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,120
Yes.

1634
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,360
I saw that on someone's license plate.

1635
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,640
Like it was actually part of the license plate.

1636
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,560
There's some hardcore nerds out there.

1637
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:09,000
We have a neighbor here that has a license plate that says Z-O-M-G hack.

1638
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,200
And I want to know who that is.

1639
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:14,480
We live in this huge complex and there's some guy with a license plate there and I'm always

1640
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,800
like, wow, it's another nerd.

1641
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,400
Someone had that said noob on it.

1642
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,400
That was pretty funny.

1643
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:20,400
That's cool.

1644
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:29,080
Just to give a little bit more about the system, by the way, it has a 200 megahertz CPU, 64

1645
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:34,080
megahertz RAM, custom graphics hardware decoding chips, takes SD cards, has 64 megahertz of

1646
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:38,160
a NAND memory.

1647
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:41,480
It basically, you don't have to re-encode any of your movies that you put on it.

1648
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:43,720
It'll play anything directly like on the computer.

1649
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,780
Price on it is 124 pounds 99, so.

1650
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:48,360
And a partridge in a pear tree.

1651
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,360
I want one.

1652
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,360
I have everything else.

1653
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:52,800
Why don't I have one of these?

1654
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,800
You should go get one.

1655
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:54,800
Ask Santa.

1656
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,800
Maybe he'll bring you one.

1657
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,760
Dear UK friends, send me one for Christmas.

1658
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:00,480
I love you forever.

1659
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,800
eBay, the gamer's shopping place.

1660
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,080
Yeah, eBay, seriously.

1661
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:10,160
Anyways, so last week we talked a little bit about Interlink's lawsuit with Nintendo over

1662
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:15,700
the Wii remote and basically saying that it's infringing on their patents for a trigger-operated

1663
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:17,080
electronic device.

1664
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:20,640
What's interesting, though, is that we've kind of figured that the whole lawsuit was

1665
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:26,160
about the fact that it's like a Wii-mote type thing, something motion-sensitive, but it's

1666
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:31,260
actually just for the stupid trigger on the bottom of the Wii-mote, which I don't know

1667
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:36,160
about you, but I think there's been remotes with triggers on the bottom of them way before

1668
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:41,200
this whole patent thing came to play, so it's going to be interesting to see how that actually

1669
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,120
plays out in court.

1670
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,960
Doesn't technically the Xbox 360 controller have a trigger on the bottom of it?

1671
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:50,600
It does have a trigger on the bottom of it, and what about the Nintendo 64 controller

1672
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:56,960
has a trigger on the bottom of it, and the PlayStation 2 has a trigger on the actual

1673
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,080
controller?

1674
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:02,480
I don't think they're going to get very far with this, to be honest, but they're going

1675
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:03,480
to try.

1676
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:08,040
Well, we will see, and we'll follow up in a future episode, and that would bring to

1677
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,080
a close this part of Orange Launch Radio.

1678
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:13,340
It's been a long week, but it's been busy, busy news week, lots of news, and there's

1679
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:17,320
plenty more to come in Part B. We haven't even gotten really, we've only scratched the

1680
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:19,880
surface on the whole Wii strap fiasco.

1681
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:22,040
We've barely had any Nintendo news this segment.

1682
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:26,760
We've got a ton of it coming up next in Orange Launch Radio Part B, so please stay tuned.

1683
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:28,320
We'll see you back here for Part B.

1684
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:33,020
