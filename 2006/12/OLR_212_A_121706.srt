00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:25,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, December 17th, 2006, Sony fesses up to a fake website, a popular role-playing series jumps to a new system, and are the Wiimotes really being Wiicalled?

2
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:36,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:42,007
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:47,450
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you for the next three hours as well as my partners in crime.

5
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to the one and only, happy, happy bunny, DarkSakura.

6
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:52,974
[SPEAKER_07]: You're doing it differently, Rob.

7
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:54,009
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?

8
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:55,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm doing the opening differently?

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,251
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing it differently, Rob.

10
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:58,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I not allowed to change things once in a while?

11
00:00:58,132 --> 00:00:59,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody likes anything different.

12
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:00,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

13
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:03,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, people only like happy trance.

14
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,158
[SPEAKER_02]: We fear change.

15
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:06,299
[SPEAKER_07]: And a corncob up their ass.

16
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello as well.

18
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:10,182
[SPEAKER_02]: You will be like us.

19
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:12,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Here comes another podcast review.

20
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:14,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura is too angsty.

21
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:19,048
[SPEAKER_02]: She is so angsty on the show all the time.

22
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:20,369
[SPEAKER_02]: But we love her.

23
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,370
[SPEAKER_02]: We love her.

24
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:21,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Angst and all.

25
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:22,451
[SPEAKER_02]: We love her.

26
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:24,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Far Cry Vengeance for the Wii.

27
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:24,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

28
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:53,128
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29
00:02:12,822 --> 00:02:13,982
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know what they're talking about.

30
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:17,104
[SPEAKER_03]: But everybody's been giving this thing like a 4 out of 10, 3 out of 10.

31
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:21,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then Elebits just recently was reviewed in Electronic Gaming Monthly.

32
00:02:21,385 --> 00:02:27,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I was reading on Destructoid something about it, and they were pissed because some people over there gave it 4s.

33
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:30,029
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and... Whatever.

34
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:30,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

35
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:35,190
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know just from reading what the... You know, just different specifics about it.

36
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,031
[SPEAKER_03]: No level editing in there.

37
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:38,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently the...

38
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:41,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

39
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:07,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

40
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:29,897
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

41
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:39,517
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty interesting.

42
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:44,419
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was an arcade version of F-Zero, which came out on the GameCube not that long ago.

43
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:44,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

44
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,480
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was kind of like that, where you got in and it would tilt around.

45
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved that game, except for the fact there were only six tracks, so it got old really quick.

46
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:52,862
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad was playing that one.

47
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:55,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I played the Japanese one at Arcade Infinity.

48
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it still kind of sucked, unfortunately.

49
00:03:57,564 --> 00:03:58,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was kind of cool.

50
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:00,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, no, the game was great.

51
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:01,325
[SPEAKER_02]: You're simple-minded.

52
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:05,927
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the game was great, don't get me wrong, but it sucked because it was over before it started.

53
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:07,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there was that.

54
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:07,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

55
00:04:07,762 --> 00:04:08,702
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

56
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:56,504
[SPEAKER_06]: and Dancing in the Rain lots of rain and I was watching Chris fall headfirst into the lagoon you know what, that was not my fucking fault we were on this little kiddie boat ride anyone who's been to Disneyland it's the storybook ride where you just pretty much sit in a boat and look at these little miniatures that are from the stories and it was raining and neither the people who were helping me into the boat were really paying attention so I slipped and almost went headfirst into the water

57
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:58,785
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

58
00:04:58,825 --> 00:04:59,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Cookie Ma!

59
00:05:26,354 --> 00:05:28,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of Cookie Mama, because Mama will make it better.

60
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:30,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you been poking Mama's steak?

61
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:32,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have, and Mama liked it.

62
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:33,737
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

63
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:38,559
[SPEAKER_02]: For those who don't catch the reference, there's obviously a part of the game where you have to poke the steak.

64
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:42,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Describe what Cookie Mama is all about for those who haven't heard of it, because we get new listeners every week.

65
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:44,081
[SPEAKER_07]: You use the stylus and you cook, really.

66
00:05:45,162 --> 00:05:45,962
[SPEAKER_02]: You shake the pan.

67
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:50,784
[SPEAKER_07]: You blow on the pot to cool it off.

68
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:53,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those levels make me think of DDR with food.

69
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:55,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Beatmania with food is like cooking mania.

70
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:59,168
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I don't know, it's a pretty fun little addicting game.

71
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Because mama will make it better.

72
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:02,912
[SPEAKER_02]: To quote Chris.

73
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

74
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:05,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cooking mama?

75
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Just cooking mama and Creature from the Black Lagoon.

76
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:08,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Pinball.

77
00:06:09,524 --> 00:06:11,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, is that a new one, or is that one you guys had?

78
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:13,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't keep track anymore.

79
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:14,627
[SPEAKER_07]: We got it a few weeks ago.

80
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,469
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still working, though, on the Rocky and Bullwinkle.

81
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there something about your Guns N' Roses table damn near went backstage to a Guns N' Roses concert?

82
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:24,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and then all that fell through, and then they canceled the Sacramento show.

83
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:28,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate you, Axl Rose, you bastard.

84
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,117
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate you for the Metallica thing.

85
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:33,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, ho, ho, ho to you, too.

86
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, happy holidays to all of our listeners.

87
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:40,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Christmas, Kwanzaa, or whatever it is you celebrate, because I think Hanukkah started.

88
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:42,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're in the middle of Hanukkah.

89
00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:42,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Yule is the 21st.

90
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:44,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh, we got Yule on the 21st.

91
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:46,356
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Kwanzaa is after Christmas.

92
00:06:46,396 --> 00:06:48,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, what, it starts the 27th?

93
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:49,037
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I hope I'm right.

94
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:50,278
[SPEAKER_02]: There's too many holidays to remember.

95
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:50,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

96
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:51,979
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Christmas is on the 25th.

97
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever it is you celebrate, I hope you're having a good one.

98
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,044
[SPEAKER_07]: And we should probably give an advance happy birthday to another person who has been on the show.

99
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:01,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

100
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:09,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Birthday to Megzi Happy Birthday to Megzi

101
00:07:33,015 --> 00:07:36,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

102
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:36,738
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

103
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:39,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Elebits.

104
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Elebits is fun.

105
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:43,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually kind of far in it.

106
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not too far, I guess.

107
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on level 9 now.

108
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:49,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

109
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:51,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried playing around with the level editor a little bit.

110
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:52,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of surprised.

111
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:55,611
[SPEAKER_03]: I still haven't seen any edit data from anybody else yet.

112
00:07:56,512 --> 00:08:00,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a bunch of my friends have to have this game, and yet I see no level data.

113
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:02,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played enough

114
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:31,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Cars for the Wii that I bought for Nelly because she wanted another racing game and she insisted on Cars and a game sucks balls.

115
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:37,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And I knew when I bought it that it was going to be awful and I just had no idea how bad it sucked, but...

116
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,334
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,542
[SPEAKER_03]: And the car, like, steers like a tank.

118
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:08,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it can't, like, turn for shit.

119
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:16,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a bunch of, like, useless-ass moves that you can do in the game, and it's just, it's really bad.

120
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It's meant for little kids, that's really what it is.

121
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:27,073
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, you know, Nellie wanted an easy game to play, so there's cars, and I guess she'll have to play that.

122
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:30,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, she's been ignoring cars and playing more Excite Truck instead.

123
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:35,645
[SPEAKER_03]: She's trying to get all the S rankings in mirror mode like Christopher has.

124
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:39,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, my roommate is obsessed with Excite Truck.

125
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt there's anybody in the world that has played this game as much as Extover.

126
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:56,091
[SPEAKER_02]: He's beaten Excite, Super Excite, Mirror Mode, and now he got all the trophies or something, so he got some super car thing that flashes when he drives and he can just go right through trees and right through other cars.

127
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:56,351
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not

128
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:59,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, can you describe this look on your face to the listeners?

129
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:00,012
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

130
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:00,112
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

131
00:10:23,283 --> 00:10:24,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Death Stare, Grand Theft Auto, WarioWare

132
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:45,182
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

133
00:10:45,362 --> 00:10:52,086
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, if you've seen that YouTube clip of the dancing stage in WarioWare, you know that this game is all you need for January.

134
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:53,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously.

135
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:54,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but that's great.

136
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:55,668
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, just...

137
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:59,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Just other things that you want to play and stuff.

138
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:03,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Even for the 360, there's really nothing I want to pick up.

139
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, January's always a dead month, really, for games.

140
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I did play Assault Heroes, and that was fun.

141
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:09,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

142
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Although people are comparing it to Quarry Warriors or something like that.

143
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:18,392
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not exactly like that, but I guess you could... It's pretty fun.

144
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:21,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it kind of reminds me of if they did an update to Breakthrough.

145
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:22,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Excite Truck got old quite quickly

146
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:46,695
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, for me, it kind of did.

147
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:49,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I was like, okay, I'm kind of done with Exciter.

148
00:11:49,798 --> 00:11:54,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I pop it in once in a while for fun, but I think it's more extroverts, Excitements wears off on me.

149
00:11:54,481 --> 00:12:01,666
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know, maybe it's something about the casual gamer, because you notice the people that are really into this that we know are two people who don't usually play a lot of games.

150
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:02,687
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's not playing it casually anymore.

151
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:03,748
[SPEAKER_03]: She's playing it for hours.

152
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:07,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but there's, you know, the casual gamer that plays Bejeweled for hours.

153
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:08,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

154
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:09,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just interesting.

155
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:10,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is about that game.

156
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:15,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the gross simplicity of the controls and everything, I think.

157
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:22,301
[SPEAKER_03]: The game really could have benefited from more tracks and maybe more diverse cars or something else, like different types of cars.

158
00:12:24,262 --> 00:12:29,704
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I really think, because it comes down to you play basically like five different continents and

159
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:36,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Each track kind of has portions of other tracks in it, so you'll drive on the same stretch of track.

160
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:40,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Airtost in our chatroom says, I didn't like Excite Truck until I put my own MP3s in.

161
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,511
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it so much better.

162
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:42,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I only need to do that.

164
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:48,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really done that with a sight track because I don't have my own SD card, but I know Xfer does, and he does that.

165
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:52,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I do with Burnout, which is the racing game I've been playing a lot lately.

166
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:58,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like all the emo EA tracks that are in it, so I put my own music, and I'm like, Sinpop in 80s, and Madonna, yeah!

167
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,221
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as I'm, you can just imagine what my Burnout games look like.

168
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:09,482
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm flying through the air, and you know, I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you.

169
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:10,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Crash!

170
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:15,093
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's like to play Burnout with me.

171
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:16,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

172
00:13:17,155 --> 00:13:17,456
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

173
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:18,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, my gaming week.

174
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also been playing Elebits a little bit.

175
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:22,957
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

176
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,920
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's kind of cool.

177
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,341
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think the comparisons to Katamari Damacy are fair.

178
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:51,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it has a lot of that same cuteness factor.

179
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:57,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the only kind of weak point is the music does not have the same infectiousness as Katamari Damacy does.

180
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, I think that's really what sets the two games apart.

181
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:03,904
[SPEAKER_02]: But so far, so good gameplay-wise, which is, you know, what's really important about a game.

182
00:14:04,884 --> 00:14:08,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm liking the whole discovering aspect and the levels take a long time to beat.

183
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:10,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was going to be like quicky little three-minute levels.

184
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these levels take like 15 minutes to play.

185
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:13,866
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty crazy.

186
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:14,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

187
00:14:25,252 --> 00:14:34,078
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the game is, where I have played enough of it, I think, to give a fair review, I did check out Final Fantasy III on the DS, which Loki was kind enough to give me a copy of.

188
00:14:34,118 --> 00:14:34,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

189
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:39,841
[SPEAKER_02]: The one aspect of this game I have not been able to review is the Wi-Fi, because no one's given me their stinking code.

190
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:46,486
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to have to go on the OL Army forums over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and see if anyone has the Final Fantasy III on the DS, because I'm really curious.

191
00:14:46,526 --> 00:14:49,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can send letters through the Moogles and towns, but that's about it.

192
00:14:50,008 --> 00:14:51,809
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of seems like the Wi-Fi thing is like,

193
00:14:52,332 --> 00:14:53,372
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

194
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy V Final Fantasy VII Final Fantasy V

195
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:42,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

196
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:01,435
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

197
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:23,000
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

198
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:37,523
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

199
00:16:58,991 --> 00:16:59,931
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

200
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:28,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was my gaming week.

201
00:17:28,818 --> 00:17:29,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris, how about you?

202
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:30,339
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

203
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's computer just made a weird noise.

204
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:33,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't even know what that was.

205
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Did your computer fart?

206
00:17:35,223 --> 00:17:35,604
[SPEAKER_02]: What did it do?

207
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:36,104
[SPEAKER_02]: It went, ah!

208
00:17:36,504 --> 00:17:37,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, strange.

209
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:37,946
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

210
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:48,134
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week, aside from making Mama really mad, I actually, and I played Sims 2, obviously.

211
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:49,135
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I play.

212
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do any of the fanfic stuff in Sims 2?

213
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:57,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Jamie was just showing us a picture of the Doctor and Rose in bed together in Sims 2.

214
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:58,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do that kind of stuff?

215
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:01,792
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you know, I used to play just the Sims.

216
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:05,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And I used to put anything I found on the internet, I'd put it in there.

217
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:08,453
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't do that with this game because it really messes it up.

218
00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:13,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have it so that if you want to customize it, you can.

219
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:16,115
[SPEAKER_06]: But it still messes it up to no end.

220
00:18:16,155 --> 00:18:17,155
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just don't do that.

221
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:21,441
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just make random characters that do stuff.

222
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:22,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

223
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:27,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I like getting the... Like, they have little things that your characters can work up to, so I've been trying to do that.

224
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,470
[SPEAKER_06]: But I actually played a PS3.

225
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:30,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you?

226
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:31,212
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you think?

227
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't like it.

228
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:34,715
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you play on it?

229
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:36,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know.

230
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:39,601
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in a kiosk, and it was at Target, and it was free!

231
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:41,495
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

232
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:09,089
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

233
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,150
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the devil!

234
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:38,750
[SPEAKER_06]: You know.

235
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:48,933
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and then I finally, you know, actually get to play it, and, you know, it was like, oh, this is not bad, because I like the graphics, but other than that, then it froze on me, and I was pissed off.

236
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:50,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I also got a little farther in Rule of Rose.

237
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:51,713
[SPEAKER_06]: That game is weird.

238
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:57,094
[SPEAKER_02]: But now when Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out for the PlayStation 3, though, you'll be all over PS3.

239
00:19:57,214 --> 00:19:58,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hell yeah.

240
00:19:58,555 --> 00:19:58,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Ring it up.

241
00:19:58,995 --> 00:19:59,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

242
00:19:59,395 --> 00:19:59,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Kingdom Hearts.

243
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:00,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

244
00:20:01,448 --> 00:20:03,509
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I'll be when Final Fantasy XIII comes out.

245
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:04,849
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll finally be the one that wins me over.

246
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:08,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, you know, and I don't think it made tonight's show roll, so I'm okay in saying this.

247
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,431
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I took somebody's story, I apologize.

248
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:12,511
[SPEAKER_02]: But I believe there was a late-breaking story.

249
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:25,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's a rumor status or what's going on, but that Metal Gear Solid 4, which was one of the PS3's big, big exclusives, some insider information coming from like a friend who knows a guy at Konami or something, you know, take it with a grain of salt.

250
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:30,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Megzi told me that.

251
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:34,586
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, I am so happy that they're going to bring it.

252
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:42,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Because for Christmas, she's getting a bunch of money, so she's going to end up going to get an Xbox.

253
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:48,072
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was like, if they're going to start putting stuff on the Xbox, I don't need to get a PS3.

254
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:48,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so happy.

255
00:20:49,642 --> 00:20:50,264
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

256
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:04,441
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to join our chat room and participate in the conversations with us, it's chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

257
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:05,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Head on over there.

258
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:08,622
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a nice full chat room tonight, so thanks, you guys, for sticking with us.

259
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:11,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's news.

260
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:16,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Earlier in our last week's show, I should say, I promised that there would be some big changes coming to our website.

261
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Realistically, that's probably not going to happen now until January.

262
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,987
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to plan a big overhaul for the website, so stay tuned for that.

263
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:25,110
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

264
00:21:44,548 --> 00:22:01,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we should say, this is our last live show of 2006, if you can believe it, because next Sunday is Christmas Eve, and the Sunday after that is New Year's Eve, and of course we have respective family and friend plans for those days, and we imagine most of you guys do too, so, you know.

265
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:05,102
[SPEAKER_06]: They have no lies outside of you, Rob.

266
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:08,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to think that, but no, no.

267
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:09,962
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that you guys probably have your own things going on.

268
00:22:10,022 --> 00:22:13,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will be delivering new content to the podcast feeds.

269
00:22:13,785 --> 00:22:17,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly look for a year-end roundup type show, our top games of the year.

270
00:22:18,008 --> 00:22:22,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Those types of things will be prerecorded and coming to our audio archive, which is available on our website.

271
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Just click on podcast over at orangeloungeradio.com.

272
00:22:28,195 --> 00:22:29,235
[SPEAKER_02]: One other quick thing I wanted to say.

273
00:22:29,275 --> 00:22:31,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to give a quick plug for iTunes.

274
00:22:33,343 --> 00:22:57,194
[SPEAKER_02]: and leaving us reviews there like happy things because the more reviews we get in iTunes the more people notice the show and you know we're all about hey we do this show for free and we try not to ask for too much um you know we in the beginning I think when we first started podcasting we got all up on this oh you gotta vote for us on podcast alley and oh give us a good thing on yahoo podcast and now we kind of you know we're just kind of like okay whatever we just want

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.

276
00:22:58,355 --> 00:22:58,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

277
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:30,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, enough begging and pleading.

278
00:23:30,093 --> 00:23:32,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into some gaming news, the core of what we're about.

279
00:23:34,577 --> 00:23:36,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Begging and pleading is awesome.

280
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially when I get stuff.

281
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:39,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to beg for something?

282
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:39,862
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

283
00:23:40,122 --> 00:23:41,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

284
00:23:41,664 --> 00:23:42,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you above begging?

285
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:43,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm above everything.

286
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:46,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what she said last night.

287
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:46,628
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

288
00:23:46,668 --> 00:23:47,449
[SPEAKER_06]: You liked it.

289
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:48,029
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

290
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,891
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not what she said last night.

291
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:50,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

292
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:51,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you didn't argue.

293
00:23:51,953 --> 00:23:52,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well this...

294
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,886
[SPEAKER_02]: This sounds like something we ought to send over to Howard Stern instead.

295
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:01,950
[SPEAKER_02]: GameDistributor.com

296
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:35,180
[SPEAKER_03]: and we do keep in constant update with a lot of them especially through the holidays because we're cutting POs like every day and stuff so

297
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:39,416
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to be the devil's advocate here.

298
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:44,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Just going from your track record in 2006, it's a little bit hit and miss.

299
00:24:44,238 --> 00:24:48,900
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that your ties really tell us the new games that are coming out.

300
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,282
[SPEAKER_02]: You knew about PlayStation 3 Oblivion long before anyone else did and mentioned it on this program.

301
00:24:54,622 --> 00:24:59,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, one of the big things that had us out there in 2006 was the Konami before E3.

302
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:02,586
[SPEAKER_02]: You knew there were going to be two DDRs for Xbox, Xbox 360.

303
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:05,107
[SPEAKER_02]: You knew there was a Castlevania game coming on DS, da-da-da-da-da-da.

304
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Release dates?

305
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:08,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It's harder because the companies move them around.

306
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:17,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's really companies that move that shit around because I wish it were, you know, announce a release date and actually the game comes out, you know, that day.

307
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:24,463
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's usually not the case because they're shifting their priorities around, you know, working on certain games.

308
00:25:24,503 --> 00:25:33,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain games are, you know, behind in development or ahead in development or, you know, certain games are done and they're just waiting for, you know, certifications.

309
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:33,611
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

310
00:25:34,383 --> 00:25:36,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo 3 coming out March 15th It has been delayed

311
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:06,382
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit, probably because they're not done with it yet, but the new date now from Microsoft is May 15th.

312
00:26:07,704 --> 00:26:09,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, who knows?

313
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:11,247
[SPEAKER_03]: That could change once we get closer to May.

314
00:26:11,547 --> 00:26:14,149
[SPEAKER_03]: But as of right now, it is May 15th.

315
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:18,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that date makes a little bit of sense in some ways and not in others.

316
00:26:18,552 --> 00:26:21,814
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it makes sense because of the beta test that we all know is going to happen in March.

317
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:24,296
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the appropriate time frame, right?

318
00:26:24,856 --> 00:26:27,458
[SPEAKER_02]: So we knew that March date was going out the window when they announced the beta test.

319
00:26:27,478 --> 00:26:32,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And the March date, too, it would make sense, too, that they'd move it because they've got other games coming out in March.

320
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:34,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And to stack three Microsoft games in one month,

321
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,262
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

322
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:59,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to have a lot of... Because maybe they think Sony and Nintendo are not going to have a lot of big titles in 2008?

323
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,722
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually... I should say the 07-08 fiscal year?

324
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, usually April-May is pretty slow.

325
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:18,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think what last year... Or I should say this year, during May, the big game release... Well, they had X-Men 3, Hitman Blood Money, and Jaws Unleashed.

326
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,531
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, that's not really that big.

327
00:27:21,851 --> 00:27:22,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you think about it.

328
00:27:23,547 --> 00:27:51,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, it makes sense that they would, you know, kind of push it back, because there's a lot of games coming out, and they also, you know, they're pushing to sell more hardware units, um, right now, and I think a lot of people are buying 360s, because, again, can't get a hold of a PlayStation 3, and kind of listening to what they're doing with the PlayStation 3, and how they're still having trouble getting units out there, despite the fact that they're still seeing 2 million by the end of the year, right, um,

329
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:59,908
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably, they're thinking that's going to be when they're starting to catch up a little bit, and then they just need something else to kind of pull the attention away from Sony type thing.

330
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:02,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that could change.

331
00:28:02,451 --> 00:28:08,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, also Forza 2 was scheduled for May now, so there's a lot of stuff that's being, you know, delayed.

332
00:28:09,097 --> 00:28:10,638
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm not surprised.

333
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:15,543
[SPEAKER_03]: The other game that got delayed, though, into February is Wii Play.

334
00:28:15,843 --> 00:28:17,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And that I'm kind of surprised about, because the game's

335
00:28:18,035 --> 00:28:19,696
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

336
00:28:40,412 --> 00:28:43,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever the case may be, Wii Play is delayed to February 20th.

337
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:48,284
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be actually one month prior, I think on January 19th is when we had it before.

338
00:28:49,286 --> 00:28:50,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is great, because I was, you know,

339
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,570
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

340
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:14,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

341
00:29:14,981 --> 00:29:15,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

342
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:15,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

343
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:45,873
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, thank you very much for the, I guess, exclusive news, and we'll see how it plays out.

344
00:29:46,393 --> 00:29:53,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I look for date changes every single day, three times, four times a day, and Halo, as soon as I saw that change, I had to talk about it.

345
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,741
[SPEAKER_02]: But that also kind of makes me go, okay, well, what's to say it's not going to move again?

346
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:57,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.

347
00:29:58,182 --> 00:30:05,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's not going to move again, and really, it could just... I've seen games that were scheduled to come out last year, and now they're scheduled to come out in 2007, so...

348
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:11,626
[SPEAKER_03]: It all depends on how quickly, you know, they're getting the game done.

349
00:30:12,806 --> 00:30:18,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I would trust your date more than the, you know, placeholders that people use on EB Games and GameStop.

350
00:30:18,468 --> 00:30:19,868
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they go, oh, the game's coming out 11-1.

351
00:30:19,948 --> 00:30:24,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, they're saying, oh, it's going to come out for Christmas because they want to sell it during Christmas.

352
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:37,092
[SPEAKER_03]: That may be, they may want to try to sell it on the anniversary of Halo or something like that, but I don't think that they're really going to hold to that, you know, just because, I don't know, they'll sell it when it's done.

353
00:30:37,552 --> 00:30:40,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well the game will be out when it's out, so we'll see if you were right or not, Loki.

354
00:30:41,847 --> 00:30:42,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

355
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:50,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there have been some strange goings-on, at least concerning Microsoft and Halo 3.

356
00:30:52,676 --> 00:31:05,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, there was a site in Europe that was trying to sell the promotional codes for the Halo 3 beta that were actually supposed to be given out as a promotional item.

357
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:08,225
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've had a major smackdown on them.

358
00:31:09,193 --> 00:31:12,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, they are not going to receive the beta codes.

359
00:31:12,815 --> 00:31:20,500
[SPEAKER_07]: They're being removed from the Xbox Community Network immediately.

360
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft is not going to have any involvement with their sites.

361
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,184
[SPEAKER_07]: They're completely cutting them off.

362
00:31:29,885 --> 00:31:31,946
[SPEAKER_07]: No goods, no nothing.

363
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:35,128
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been excommunicated from the Church of Gates.

364
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:35,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

365
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:36,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

366
00:31:37,348 --> 00:31:41,750
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's basically people trying to turn a profit on something that doesn't really belong to them to sell.

367
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, they shouldn't do that crap.

368
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:47,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I say they have it coming.

369
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:49,352
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of glad Microsoft's laying the smack down.

370
00:31:49,752 --> 00:31:51,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for some values.

371
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:52,413
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

372
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:52,933
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

373
00:31:53,754 --> 00:31:54,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft's going to have to choke a bitch.

374
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Bill Gates going to have to choke a bitch?

375
00:31:59,015 --> 00:31:59,376
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

376
00:31:59,996 --> 00:32:03,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that would more be like probably Peter Moore choking a bitch or Major Nelson.

377
00:32:03,497 --> 00:32:04,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll see why they call him Major.

378
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:06,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

379
00:32:09,142 --> 00:32:11,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is somebody in the chatroom named Marky Mark?

380
00:32:12,604 --> 00:32:13,364
[SPEAKER_07]: That's funny.

381
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:15,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's their name.

382
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:17,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the Funky Bunch is not far behind.

383
00:32:18,247 --> 00:32:19,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe they hear that line a lot.

384
00:32:19,427 --> 00:32:20,248
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fantastic.

385
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:22,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Marky Mark, you are the chatroom hero.

386
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,391
[SPEAKER_02]: But look, Marky Mark's the first to bitch, though.

387
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Why all this old news?

388
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, we do a show weekly.

389
00:32:29,653 --> 00:32:36,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you heard, but we do a show weekly, so sometimes we have to do stories that might come out on Monday.

390
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:36,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

391
00:32:37,492 --> 00:32:38,313
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX 360 Backward Compatibility

392
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:06,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Family Guy, Mortal Kombat Armageddon, Psychonauts, which a lot of folks were waiting for, Scarface, Soul Calibur 2, and a lot of other titles.

393
00:33:07,129 --> 00:33:12,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Many, many, many titles, and the list is now over 300 original Xbox titles.

394
00:33:12,733 --> 00:33:14,575
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to see the complete list, you can check that out.

395
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:20,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Major Nelson posted a list on his blog, or you can head over to the Xbox official website to check that out.

396
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:23,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

397
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:24,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, ma'am.

398
00:33:24,874 --> 00:33:27,436
[SPEAKER_06]: For dumb people, what does backwards compatibility mean?

399
00:33:27,516 --> 00:33:28,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, not a problem.

400
00:33:28,597 --> 00:33:31,138
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, because you play, like, casual games.

401
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:34,080
[SPEAKER_02]: But you do more computer gaming, right, than you do console?

402
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:35,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't do a lot of console games.

403
00:33:35,641 --> 00:33:37,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I mostly do, yeah, computer games.

404
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:38,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem.

405
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:39,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not know what backwards compatibility is.

406
00:33:39,824 --> 00:33:41,125
[SPEAKER_07]: A gamer on a Mac.

407
00:33:41,265 --> 00:33:41,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem.

408
00:33:41,906 --> 00:33:42,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up, DJ Ranma.

409
00:33:42,826 --> 00:33:44,989
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm pointing out Mac games.

410
00:33:57,863 --> 00:34:01,787
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the biggest things about the PlayStation 2 is that all my old PlayStation games will work on it.

411
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:06,851
[SPEAKER_02]: When PlayStation 3 came out, it was, oh, all my old PlayStation 2 games will work on it, and so on and so on.

412
00:34:07,231 --> 00:34:16,199
[SPEAKER_02]: But when the Xbox 360 came out, it was, well, we have software emulation because we changed our graphics chip, so some of the games will work on it.

413
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:21,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll release updates every so often, and we're going to get 99% of our library.

414
00:34:21,722 --> 00:34:22,242
[SPEAKER_02]: What did he say?

415
00:34:22,382 --> 00:34:25,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposed to be every month, and it's been every six months or whatever.

416
00:34:25,624 --> 00:34:32,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So needless to say, Microsoft hasn't been quite as speedy as we would have liked, but they're trying to get more of the old school Xbox titles playable.

417
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:33,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem.

418
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:35,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem.

419
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:35,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

420
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:40,853
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, speaking of being behind on updates and stuff,

421
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:53,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking... One of the updates that just recently happened to the dashboard is causing a lot of stir, especially with people claiming that it's bricked their console and now they want their share of the profits.

422
00:34:54,551 --> 00:35:03,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as we mentioned last week, there was a class action lawsuit filed by some guy for damages basically caused by this update.

423
00:35:04,153 --> 00:35:08,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, there's been some actual updates to this and what exactly it was about.

424
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:10,014
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole...

425
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:19,135
[SPEAKER_03]: The premise of this class action lawsuit was they claimed that because of this update, they had to have their console fixed.

426
00:35:19,335 --> 00:35:24,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And Microsoft wanted $140 to fix their console instead of doing it for free because it was their fault.

427
00:35:25,183 --> 00:35:29,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he's basically saying that they're using this to profit from it.

428
00:35:31,026 --> 00:35:39,372
[SPEAKER_03]: He's seeking $5 million in damages, which is basically just to get them into the correct courthouse.

429
00:35:40,152 --> 00:35:47,758
[SPEAKER_03]: They will, of course, adjust the amount depending on how many people are claiming to have the same problem.

430
00:35:48,158 --> 00:35:50,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, it's about 400 people.

431
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:59,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're saying 1% of the 360 owners right now have this problem, and 400 people have come forward saying that they do have this problem.

432
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:07,787
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I think, I thought that what I heard before that they were fixing these for free, you know, the ones that were

433
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:09,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so, yeah.

434
00:36:09,683 --> 00:36:10,944
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like what happened to me.

435
00:36:33,888 --> 00:36:42,751
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that, I mean... No, I think if Microsoft realized their error, apologized for it, and fixed the machines, there should not be a lawsuit.

436
00:36:43,071 --> 00:36:43,872
[SPEAKER_02]: There shouldn't be a lawsuit.

437
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:50,254
[SPEAKER_02]: People have a right to be mad at them and question, you know, if they want to trust them in the future, but lawsuits are totally unnecessary.

438
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:54,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what they need to do, and this is basically what they did before with the overheating problem with the consoles.

439
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,017
[SPEAKER_03]: People had sent them in to get fixed.

440
00:36:57,217 --> 00:37:00,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Say they sent it in to get fixed for this specific issue.

441
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:04,854
[SPEAKER_03]: If they paid the money to have it fixed they would be refunded this money

442
00:37:05,585 --> 00:37:09,328
[SPEAKER_03]: If they haven't sent it in yet, they would be fixing them for free.

443
00:37:09,668 --> 00:37:14,091
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like they did with the consoles sold at launch that were having heating issues.

444
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:17,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And if your console bricks because of that, they would fix it for free.

445
00:37:17,973 --> 00:37:18,514
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did.

446
00:37:18,674 --> 00:37:23,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they will send you a refund for the amount that you paid to fix it.

447
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:26,179
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was pissed when my console bricked.

448
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:27,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Go back and listen to a show around.

449
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,741
[SPEAKER_02]: It was around Valentine's Day when this happened.

450
00:37:30,162 --> 00:37:32,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was pissed when my console bricked.

451
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said a lot of nasty things about Microsoft.

452
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:39,207
[SPEAKER_02]: When we say a console is bricked, Chris is like, bricked?

453
00:37:39,447 --> 00:37:41,528
[SPEAKER_02]: When we say a console is bricked, that means it broke.

454
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:44,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't do anything but hold down paper with it, essentially.

455
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,991
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we call it bricks.

456
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:48,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm helping people who may not know that.

457
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:49,312
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

458
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also the other cool term I like is that they send you a coffin.

459
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:57,036
[SPEAKER_02]: And the coffin is what you put the brick in because you're sending it back to Microsoft to be buried.

460
00:37:57,397 --> 00:38:03,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish, though, I understand why they want to do these lawsuits and stuff, but I really wish that people would just...

461
00:38:04,437 --> 00:38:04,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

462
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:19,130
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

463
00:38:45,587 --> 00:38:47,468
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

464
00:39:15,822 --> 00:39:17,363
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of new people in chat tonight.

465
00:39:17,383 --> 00:39:18,064
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome.

466
00:39:18,084 --> 00:39:20,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, you guys, for coming in the live experience.

467
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:28,553
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anyone else ever wants to join us live, we tape Sundays at 6 o'clock Pacific time, although you'll have to wait until 2007 to really pick that up again.

468
00:39:28,874 --> 00:39:33,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess our first live show would be, what, January 6th or whatever that first Sunday is in January.

469
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:34,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So look for us then.

470
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:35,720
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

471
00:39:37,261 --> 00:39:38,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any other chat comments here?

472
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,105
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of folks going back and forth between –

473
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:45,916
[SPEAKER_02]: The Lawsuit, DDR Dollar Bill says, I will sue for stubbing my toe.

474
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's from playing too much DDR.

475
00:39:49,937 --> 00:39:57,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Mystic, oh, the Weird Al song that Jamie was playing in her car the other day, because I was going to say, this whole thing makes me think of that Weird Al song about all the lawsuits.

476
00:40:00,402 --> 00:40:03,923
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway, let's keep it moving with some more gaming news.

477
00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:05,904
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't want to move.

478
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:06,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm comfortable.

479
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:09,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I will pick you up and throw you.

480
00:40:10,046 --> 00:40:10,326
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

481
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:17,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of throwing, we had someone throw up some secret information, apparently.

482
00:40:18,324 --> 00:40:23,206
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure everyone's familiar with the actress Kristen Bell, yes?

483
00:40:24,527 --> 00:40:25,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Veronica Mars?

484
00:40:25,267 --> 00:40:27,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

485
00:40:27,348 --> 00:40:29,008
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of Extrovert's favorite shows.

486
00:40:29,128 --> 00:40:31,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to watch that show because apparently Joss is a big fan.

487
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently.

488
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Joss Whedon is my lord and master.

489
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:37,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't watched it, but I want to.

490
00:40:39,238 --> 00:40:41,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, Heroes is my lord and master.

491
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,540
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the best damn show I've watched in like the past five years.

492
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Those fuckers are making us wait until January for new episodes.

493
00:40:47,842 --> 00:40:48,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate them.

494
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:53,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the Lost fans have to wait until February.

495
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:54,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

496
00:40:54,725 --> 00:40:56,486
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still Lost fans, but Lost sucks.

497
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:58,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait.

498
00:40:58,427 --> 00:41:05,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I do, by the way, have to thank our friends at PodCulture for sending me 11 episodes of Heroes so I can get started.

499
00:41:05,976 --> 00:41:07,677
[SPEAKER_02]: All I have to say, you'll love Peter.

500
00:41:07,737 --> 00:41:08,358
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the bomb.

501
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:09,138
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll love him.

502
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

503
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,180
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

504
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, back to the story.

505
00:41:16,504 --> 00:41:20,847
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a game coming out called Assassin's Creed that's out by Ubisoft.

506
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:23,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, she sort of spilled the beans.

507
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:32,155
[SPEAKER_07]: She said, to quote, it's sort of based on the research that's sort of happening now, but the fact that your genes might be able to hold memory.

508
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:39,676
[SPEAKER_07]: And you could argue semantics and say it's instinct, but how does a baby bird know how to eat a worm as opposed to a cockroach if its parents don't show it?

509
00:41:40,796 --> 00:41:43,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess he's talking about genetic memory and all that.

510
00:41:45,638 --> 00:41:46,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

511
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:16,555
[SPEAKER_07]: And my favorite thing about this, I'm getting this, I actually get this story from Eurogamer, who, they are fantastic.

512
00:42:16,955 --> 00:42:20,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I just love that they call it Ass Creed in the title.

513
00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:29,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely, well, not exactly off topic here, but I'm officially boycotting Ubisoft games.

514
00:42:29,864 --> 00:42:30,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

515
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:32,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all of the games... Newbie Soft?

516
00:42:33,487 --> 00:42:33,687
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

517
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:34,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Newbie Soft.

518
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:35,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Newbie Soft?

519
00:42:35,188 --> 00:42:36,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever heard of that, Newbie Soft?

520
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:36,969
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Ubisoft.

521
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:37,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

522
00:42:38,638 --> 00:42:44,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Their last few games have really blown, and I think back to everything that I've bought from them.

523
00:42:44,822 --> 00:43:01,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, Ghost Recon and the Tom Clancy games aren't really my cup of tea, but the stuff for the Wii, Red Steel, Blue, GT sucked, Monster 4x4 sucked, the Wii version of Splinter Cell sucked, Far Cry sucks...

524
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not buying any more of your games.

525
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:05,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

526
00:43:05,993 --> 00:43:08,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Rayman's Raven Rapids was okay, but still kind of sucked.

527
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:11,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so... And Shannon Arms wasn't bad.

528
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:12,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they publish that?

529
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,041
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't make it, but they published it.

530
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:20,648
[SPEAKER_03]: They published it, okay, but still, though, I think that... They just kind of bought something from Ubisoft already.

531
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:20,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

532
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done with Ubisoft.

533
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:25,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, looking forward to some of the stuff that they have coming out, like...

534
00:43:26,767 --> 00:43:39,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 which by the way looking at screenshots of that in the original one you can't tell them apart I will not be buying that game I am so inviting somebody from Ubisoft to come on this program in the future

535
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeremy Todd 1 says in our chatroom, Loki, that's a dumb move.

536
00:43:46,093 --> 00:43:49,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Boycotting games will cause the Wii to turn out the same way as the GameCube.

537
00:43:49,316 --> 00:43:50,477
[SPEAKER_02]: No third-party support.

538
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:56,121
[SPEAKER_02]: If people boycott third-party games, then they will stop making games, and the Wii will die just like the GameCube did.

539
00:43:56,661 --> 00:43:57,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree and I disagree.

540
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:07,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that you should buy a game just to support third-party development, but if Loki thinks the game sucks, he shouldn't have to buy it.

541
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:08,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

542
00:44:08,531 --> 00:44:10,313
[SPEAKER_02]: But Loki's just kind of harsh on games.

543
00:44:10,393 --> 00:44:12,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, God, you think GameSpot's bad?

544
00:44:12,876 --> 00:44:14,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... Hey, listen, listen.

545
00:44:14,878 --> 00:44:15,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not harsh on games.

546
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,421
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, seriously, Red Steel.

547
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:18,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I had high hopes for this game.

548
00:44:18,883 --> 00:44:20,905
[SPEAKER_03]: This game, you know, sold the console for me.

549
00:44:20,945 --> 00:44:22,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now, whose fault is it?

550
00:44:22,187 --> 00:44:23,108
[SPEAKER_02]: You got your hopes up.

551
00:44:23,777 --> 00:44:24,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a deep breath.

552
00:44:47,016 --> 00:44:47,537
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awful.

553
00:44:47,657 --> 00:44:49,742
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, back on track here, okay?

554
00:44:49,942 --> 00:44:50,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep going.

555
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Real quick, real quick.

556
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Tetsuya, Loki, Red Steel 2?

557
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:55,435
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna suck.

558
00:44:55,796 --> 00:44:56,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not buying it.

559
00:44:58,297 --> 00:45:00,259
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll just be the same damn fucking engine.

560
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:10,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, they can go back and tweak it and make it a little bit better, but please, you know, take a page from Capcom, listen to the goddamn feedback from the people that play your games.

561
00:45:10,886 --> 00:45:16,771
[SPEAKER_02]: James Patrick, Red Steel is better than Killzone, and Mace Griffin on PS2, Red Steel isn't that bad.

562
00:45:18,354 --> 00:45:21,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Killzone on PlayStation 2, that game was fucking old.

563
00:45:21,516 --> 00:45:26,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And granted, the game itself, I mean, is probably pretty good, it's just the controls that suck.

564
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,043
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's really bad about it, is the fact that they really fucked up what could have been a good game.

565
00:45:31,764 --> 00:45:33,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackboy says, I kind of liked Red Steel.

566
00:45:34,225 --> 00:45:36,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, to each their own, but you know what?

567
00:45:36,787 --> 00:45:41,771
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people out there that are actually going to put down money for Splinter Cell Double Agent on the Wii, and I go, why?

568
00:45:42,011 --> 00:45:42,991
[SPEAKER_03]: But, whatever.

569
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:43,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

570
00:45:44,403 --> 00:45:53,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, buy GT and Monster 4x4 for the Wii, because those aren't like old GameCube games or something that they just re-released and tacked on controls to.

571
00:45:53,907 --> 00:45:54,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, no they are.

572
00:45:55,828 --> 00:45:59,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I see Jamie twiddling her thumbs over there, she's sick of Loki bitching.

573
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:00,910
[SPEAKER_02]: She's ready to get to a new story, aren't you?

574
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't you, DarkSakura?

575
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:05,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well I have a story about Luminous.

576
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:06,352
[SPEAKER_02]: You like Luminous, right?

577
00:46:06,412 --> 00:46:07,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Luminous!

578
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:08,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like Luminous on the Xbox 360?

579
00:46:12,256 --> 00:46:13,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take that as a no.

580
00:46:13,218 --> 00:46:14,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played it.

581
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:14,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

582
00:46:16,763 --> 00:46:21,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, I don't know how to answer that because I like Luminous and I like the Xbox 360.

583
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:21,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

584
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:26,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Luminous on the 360 is great except for the Xbox 360 controller.

585
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:34,053
[SPEAKER_02]: and the fact that, you know, you have all these microtransactions and the fact that if you own the PSP version, there's really not a lot of reason to get Luminous on 360.

586
00:46:35,153 --> 00:46:38,975
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't have a PSP, you really should have Luminous on the 360.

587
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:42,417
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but anyway, there's a reason why I bring this up.

588
00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:49,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox and Microsoft apparently thinks more people should be playing Luminous and they are going to have an official competition.

589
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:54,943
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Xbox Live Arcade Challenge and it's going to feature Luminous Live starting...

590
00:46:55,243 --> 00:46:58,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, the 17th, and it's going to run through the 23rd of December.

591
00:46:58,605 --> 00:47:13,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think you're good at Luminous, specifically the 60-second attack mode, if you can make a ton of bricks in the 60-second attack mode, I mean, it doesn't take long to try, you should enter this contest, and you might win a 42-inch Hitachi Plasma HD TV.

592
00:47:13,992 --> 00:47:21,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Four runners-up will get an HD DVD bundle, a wireless headset, and the 360 wireless racing wheel.

593
00:47:21,476 --> 00:47:24,457
[SPEAKER_02]: 100 ranking players, like the next 100 ranking players,

594
00:47:24,738 --> 00:47:32,102
[SPEAKER_02]: will get 500 Microsoft Points tokens to be redeemed for Xbox Live imagery, which I'm assuming means you can't buy games with it.

595
00:47:33,002 --> 00:47:40,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably because it would... I'm assuming the reason why is because it would screw up the reimbursement to the creators of the game, which is why they force you to get imagery with it.

596
00:47:40,946 --> 00:47:47,569
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you really wanted a Halo theme that you have to pay for or something, I guess you could place in the top 100 and get it.

597
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:53,152
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, they're also doing Small Arms, and that is running from the 24th of this month through the 30th.

598
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:55,519
[SPEAKER_02]: So you only have to be in the top 105.

599
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So get to work.

600
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see some OL Army members win some Xbox Live imagery.

601
00:48:03,362 --> 00:48:04,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be fun?

602
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:07,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have to buy into this competition for Loomis?

603
00:48:07,243 --> 00:48:09,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have to buy the game, but I believe that's it.

604
00:48:09,604 --> 00:48:10,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything else you have to purchase.

605
00:48:13,005 --> 00:48:13,825
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't believe so.

606
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:18,627
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have had a thing that you have to purchase to turn the game off.

607
00:48:20,047 --> 00:48:21,768
[SPEAKER_02]: The tournament skin or whatever?

608
00:48:23,085 --> 00:48:24,006
[SPEAKER_02]: The Power Button skin?

609
00:48:24,066 --> 00:48:24,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, forget it.

610
00:48:24,586 --> 00:48:25,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's keep it moving.

611
00:48:27,147 --> 00:48:27,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

612
00:48:29,128 --> 00:48:31,949
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um... God, I hate Luminous.

613
00:48:33,209 --> 00:48:34,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Luminous is great.

614
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:38,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I love, like... I love Luminous for PSP.

615
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:41,752
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my absolute favorite game that came out last year, you know?

616
00:48:41,812 --> 00:48:43,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love Mizuguchi.

617
00:48:43,293 --> 00:48:44,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the man's a god.

618
00:48:45,314 --> 00:48:46,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgive him for 99 Nights.

619
00:48:46,955 --> 00:48:48,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Even I didn't think that game was that bad.

620
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the good in 99 Nights, okay?

621
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:53,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Every Xtend Extra I ran out and bought.

622
00:48:53,343 --> 00:48:58,105
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, Luminous 2, if you didn't have Luminous 1, Luminous 2 is really good.

623
00:48:58,345 --> 00:49:00,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if you're a fan of Luminous, Luminous 2 is really, really good.

624
00:49:01,246 --> 00:49:01,787
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

625
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:03,587
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just hating on puzzle games.

626
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,628
[SPEAKER_02]: You're hating on everything today.

627
00:49:05,928 --> 00:49:12,031
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you're looking for some better games to be coming out, the XNA is definitely one way that might happen.

628
00:49:12,051 --> 00:49:20,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially since now it's allowing a lot of independent developers to create their own Xbox Live Arcade games, or possibly Xbox Live Arcade games.

629
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:26,255
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're saying that basically the XNA is going to become the YouTube for games.

630
00:49:26,775 --> 00:49:34,621
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to ask, are these going to be games that are reruns of shows that were on the night before that I can catch in case I missed, you know?

631
00:49:35,061 --> 00:49:38,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it going to be like, you know, knockoffs of everything or, you know...

632
00:49:40,258 --> 00:49:41,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Game A with music from Game B

633
00:49:58,376 --> 00:50:00,718
[SPEAKER_03]: To be able to share your own games with the whole community.

634
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:18,455
[SPEAKER_02]: XNA, XNA, XNA

635
00:50:38,584 --> 00:50:43,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I downloaded it and I'm like, I don't know how the fuck to use this, and I deleted it.

636
00:50:43,426 --> 00:50:52,730
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I don't have to pay $99 a year for YouTube, so I don't understand how this... You only have to pay $99, I believe, to play the games on your Xbox 360.

637
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,972
[SPEAKER_03]: You can distribute them for free, like using Windows.

638
00:50:58,072 --> 00:50:59,272
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play the games on Windows.

639
00:50:59,352 --> 00:51:04,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently, I guess, the wired controllers and the wireless ones, once that wireless adapter comes out,

640
00:51:05,922 --> 00:51:08,484
[SPEAKER_03]: All the XNA games will support those controllers.

641
00:51:09,845 --> 00:51:19,293
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't necessarily need to buy into this yet, but I would like to see an open place where you can play some games or download some free arcade games.

642
00:51:19,573 --> 00:51:20,114
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be nice.

643
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:26,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Funnydale says, XNA will never be YouTube because 90% of people are too stupid to use XNA.

644
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you imagine if they banned stupid people from YouTube?

645
00:51:31,303 --> 00:51:33,385
[SPEAKER_02]: There'd be no YouTube.

646
00:51:33,405 --> 00:51:33,605
[SPEAKER_02]: So nice.

647
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:36,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

648
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:49,483
[SPEAKER_07]: You better patent that.

649
00:51:49,503 --> 00:51:50,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Britney Spears, I really want you to put on panties.

650
00:51:50,964 --> 00:51:51,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Why won't you listen to me, girl?

651
00:51:51,965 --> 00:51:53,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Britney Spears is actually listening to you on YouTube.

652
00:51:53,926 --> 00:51:55,527
[SPEAKER_04]: She's searching for your blog.

653
00:52:20,419 --> 00:52:22,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's a game I'd like to see in XNA.

654
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Help Britney Spears dress herself.

655
00:52:27,122 --> 00:52:27,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

656
00:52:27,543 --> 00:52:29,263
[SPEAKER_03]: They made Britney Spears dance beat.

657
00:52:30,204 --> 00:52:30,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Britney's dance beat?

658
00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:32,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the greatest thing.

659
00:52:32,225 --> 00:52:34,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought about getting this for you for Christmas.

660
00:52:34,386 --> 00:52:38,608
[SPEAKER_03]: They had it at some stupid jewelry store or whatever.

661
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:43,691
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a DDR-like game, but it was to teach you how to cheerlead.

662
00:52:43,711 --> 00:52:46,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, I saw commercials for that.

663
00:52:46,572 --> 00:52:48,233
[SPEAKER_06]: That was so fucking hilarious.

664
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, okay girls, go!

665
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:54,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that just like Para Para Paradise?

666
00:52:54,696 --> 00:52:55,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

667
00:52:55,316 --> 00:52:55,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

668
00:52:57,517 --> 00:53:01,120
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like an exercise video, except you're on a DDR-type mat.

669
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:02,841
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was funny.

670
00:53:04,201 --> 00:53:04,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

671
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, how about something different?

672
00:53:08,844 --> 00:53:09,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, like what?

673
00:53:09,405 --> 00:53:10,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than cheerleaders.

674
00:53:11,246 --> 00:53:12,206
[SPEAKER_07]: How about release dates?

675
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:14,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now let's talk about some games we'll actually get to play.

676
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:16,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris laughed.

677
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:17,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

678
00:53:46,082 --> 00:53:48,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming out... Oh, stop that.

679
00:53:49,384 --> 00:53:49,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

680
00:53:50,425 --> 00:53:50,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey!

681
00:53:50,885 --> 00:53:55,088
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of funny because this game's coming out on the winter solstice.

682
00:53:55,128 --> 00:53:59,071
[SPEAKER_07]: The 21st, we have Sam & Max Episode 2, Situation Comedy for the PC.

683
00:53:59,851 --> 00:54:02,273
[SPEAKER_07]: The 22nd, Marvel Ultimate Alliance on Wii.

684
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Open Season, Star Trek Legacy.

685
00:54:06,135 --> 00:54:09,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii Sports on Christmas Day, which is bizarre.

686
00:54:10,238 --> 00:54:10,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

687
00:54:11,545 --> 00:54:13,826
[SPEAKER_07]: and then a few other to be announced ones.

688
00:54:13,846 --> 00:54:19,287
[SPEAKER_07]: The Silent Hill Origins, Point Blank, Limbo of the Lost, which just sounds very interesting.

689
00:54:20,808 --> 00:54:21,248
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

690
00:54:21,328 --> 00:54:22,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Really not too much else.

691
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:23,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

692
00:54:24,149 --> 00:54:26,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, what's to be expected right before Christmas?

693
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:29,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, if you're in Japan, you have a lot of other options.

694
00:54:30,491 --> 00:54:32,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360 over in Japan.

695
00:54:32,051 --> 00:54:33,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, these Japanese release dates.

696
00:54:33,612 --> 00:54:35,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Lost Planet coming out on December 21st.

697
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Madden NFL 07 if you're a football fan in Japan.

698
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:46,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Need for Speed Carbon and Sonic the Hedgehog all making their way to the Xbox 360 on December 21st.

699
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:54,956
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 is going to see Armored Core 4 on the 21st, also their version of Need for Speed Carbon and their version of Sonic the Hedgehog all making their way to the PlayStation 3.

700
00:54:55,805 --> 00:54:57,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Over on Nintendo Wii, guess what?

701
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Need for Speed Carbon, because that game comes out everywhere.

702
00:55:00,186 --> 00:55:04,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you're getting Monster 4x4 World Circuit from Ubisoft.

703
00:55:04,827 --> 00:55:05,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray!

704
00:55:06,268 --> 00:55:07,468
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PlayStation 2.

705
00:55:08,228 --> 00:55:10,449
[SPEAKER_02]: School Love, which is our game name of the week.

706
00:55:10,549 --> 00:55:12,849
[SPEAKER_02]: School Love comes out.

707
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, a limited edition.

708
00:55:15,825 --> 00:55:30,097
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is made by Views, and again, it's a PlayStation 2 game, and of course, what Japanese release would be incomplete without the anime-looking cute girls in uniforms on the cover with the name School Love underneath that?

709
00:55:30,117 --> 00:55:30,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Dating Sim, right?

710
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:36,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what it looks like, because I'm looking at the little screenshot pictures here.

711
00:55:36,603 --> 00:55:37,203
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a Dating Sim?

712
00:55:37,224 --> 00:55:38,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looks like a Dating Sim.

713
00:55:38,805 --> 00:55:43,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have ever wanted to date school girls in the comfort of your own home,

714
00:55:44,502 --> 00:55:46,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I have yaoi dating sims, those are always fun.

715
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:11,108
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

716
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the porn one.

717
00:56:31,641 --> 00:56:34,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta get to the rest of the releases, because there's some big stuff in here.

718
00:56:34,722 --> 00:56:41,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Evangelion, there's Secret of Evangelion coming out from Jinx, also in Japan on PlayStation 2.

719
00:56:42,406 --> 00:56:45,848
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, Squeenix fanboys, prepare thyselves.

720
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:47,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Here comes your fanboy boner.

721
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:52,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Seiken Detsetsu 4, also known as Dawn of Mana, December 21st, this week.

722
00:56:53,512 --> 00:56:55,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I need new pants.

723
00:56:57,294 --> 00:56:58,074
[SPEAKER_02]: There goes her boner.

724
00:56:58,635 --> 00:56:58,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

725
00:56:59,565 --> 00:57:06,108
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Nintendo DS, you have a cute pouch, DS, oh, these are like just little pouches, I think.

726
00:57:06,909 --> 00:57:08,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel Pocket with DS Diary.

727
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:13,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of little things coming out there for the DS, accessory-wise.

728
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sweet pouch, also coming from Konami.

729
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:22,416
[SPEAKER_02]: But get this, if you cannot get enough hamster action on your Nintendo DS...

730
00:57:24,139 --> 00:57:30,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Hamster to Kurasawa is coming out on the Nintendo DS in Japan this week.

731
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:32,102
[SPEAKER_02]: And look at the cute cover!

732
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:32,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god!

733
00:57:36,163 --> 00:57:37,064
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great radio.

734
00:57:37,084 --> 00:57:39,825
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great radio.

735
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:45,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me post that link in our chatroom there if you folks would like to check out the Love Hamsters there on the DS.

736
00:57:46,385 --> 00:57:55,691
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't... What... Seriously, can one of our, like, Japanese listeners, because I know we have some, can one of them email me and please tell me what is up with hamsters?

737
00:57:56,152 --> 00:57:59,174
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think I want to buy... Apparently they're good for the ass.

738
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:05,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I... I think... Sadly, that trend was probably started in America.

739
00:58:05,678 --> 00:58:13,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to actually buy one of those DS hamster games, because they have the hamsters ones over... Unfortunately, it's by Ubisoft, but...

740
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So much for your boycott.

741
00:58:16,241 --> 00:58:21,803
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Hamster's Life or whatever, and you get to create your own little house and stuff.

742
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:24,184
[SPEAKER_03]: So I might buy that just to try it out.

743
00:58:24,945 --> 00:58:26,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a rebuttal for the chatroom, by the way.

744
00:58:26,686 --> 00:58:27,066
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

745
00:58:27,406 --> 00:58:29,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you know Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game?

746
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:31,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

747
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,821
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a quote in Puzzle Fighter

748
00:59:01,841 --> 00:59:03,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, I'm sorry, those dates are in February, never mind.

749
00:59:04,602 --> 00:59:05,243
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a ways out.

750
00:59:05,763 --> 00:59:08,184
[SPEAKER_02]: But you will get new games on the 22nd of February.

751
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:10,125
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all I care to share with you at this time.

752
00:59:11,306 --> 00:59:17,148
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for games in the United States this week, you're not going to have much to choose from, actually.

753
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:21,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out on the PSP, we have Metal Slug Anthology.

754
00:59:23,031 --> 00:59:24,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Bubble Bobble Evolution.

755
00:59:26,517 --> 00:59:37,627
[SPEAKER_03]: and then on Playstation 2 Brave the Search for Spirit Dancer which is delayed since like August and on PC Paws and Claws Pet School where you get to

756
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:45,594
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to cure animals by petting them and... I swear to God, you... Oh my God, cute!

757
00:59:45,994 --> 00:59:47,155
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you do!

758
00:59:47,175 --> 00:59:49,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're dying from cancer!

759
00:59:49,476 --> 00:59:51,277
[SPEAKER_05]: My petting will save you!

760
00:59:51,638 --> 00:59:53,879
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically this game, I swear to God.

761
00:59:54,879 --> 01:00:03,404
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the Xbox 360, you're getting Rappala trophies, because if you really want a really crappy-ass fishing game, there you go.

762
01:00:03,564 --> 01:00:07,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Mad Catz, the Xbox Live Arcade Retro Stick, which...

763
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:13,384
[SPEAKER_03]: People say it's awesome for Xbox Live Arcade games, but I think it looks like a giant piece of crap.

764
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:16,186
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you want to buy it, great.

765
01:00:16,686 --> 01:00:19,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Shouldn't you try it before you pass judgment on it here on this program?

766
01:00:20,389 --> 01:00:21,890
[SPEAKER_03]: It just looks awful, dude.

767
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:25,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not buying an arcade stick for just a couple Xbox Live Arcade games.

768
01:00:25,934 --> 01:00:28,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I will build my own stick before I go and buy one.

769
01:00:29,456 --> 01:00:30,317
[SPEAKER_03]: But, that's it.

770
01:00:33,019 --> 01:00:33,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

771
01:00:34,941 --> 01:00:37,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I have some game news.

772
01:00:38,433 --> 01:00:39,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy Tactics, Shishi Sensou

773
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:14,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Meaning that they're also saying it's going to be cel-shaded, have new jobs, and is a sequel to the PSX one.

774
01:01:15,013 --> 01:01:20,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, because I heard it was like a direct port of the PlayStation one, but it sounds like they're enhancing it, like a lot of these, you know.

775
01:01:20,334 --> 01:01:20,855
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a sequel.

776
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:22,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh, interesting.

777
01:01:23,176 --> 01:01:24,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be cool.

778
01:01:25,076 --> 01:01:34,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if it's the same one with more stuff, then that will still be fun, because Final Fantasy Tactics, even though I'm not a fan of tactics games, I think it's cool.

779
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I like watching people play them.

780
01:01:36,243 --> 01:01:40,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy Tactics A2, Fuketsu no Gurimore I like Final Fantasy Tactics

781
01:02:04,235 --> 01:02:05,375
[SPEAKER_02]: All I want for Xmas is a PSP.com

782
01:02:32,779 --> 01:02:33,861
[SPEAKER_02]: All I Want For Xmas Is A PSP.com

783
01:02:49,824 --> 01:02:50,565
[SPEAKER_02]: All I want is a PSP!

784
01:03:09,195 --> 01:03:09,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Xmas of PSP.com

785
01:03:21,949 --> 01:03:24,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Zipatoni is one of Sony's marketing firms.

786
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:30,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So people, once this caught wind on the game blogs, people started spamming the crap out of this site.

787
01:03:30,835 --> 01:03:33,036
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, liars, we found you out.

788
01:03:33,096 --> 01:03:34,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Zipatoni.

789
01:03:35,438 --> 01:03:38,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And just all this nasty, nasty shit written in these comments.

790
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:43,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you missed all this action play out, sorry, the site's gone because it's just a big white page now.

791
01:03:43,383 --> 01:03:48,046
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happened later in the week, Sony fessed up at something to the effect of,

792
01:03:48,632 --> 01:03:54,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah, blah, blah, you caught us, blah, blah, blah, I guess we were too funky fresh for you, blah, blah, blah, etc.

793
01:03:55,115 --> 01:03:57,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Continuing to make themselves look stupid.

794
01:03:57,656 --> 01:04:09,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the problem I think most people had with All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com is not necessarily the fact that they were being lied to, because there's been previous viral marketing campaigns that were kind of, you know, fun, like the I Love Bees and stuff like that.

795
01:04:10,262 --> 01:04:17,666
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem with All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com is they made your typical gamer look like a dumbass.

796
01:04:18,849 --> 01:04:26,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just a complete and utter... Seriously, when I watch these videos, I felt my intelligence be insulted.

797
01:04:26,554 --> 01:04:28,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is supposed to win me over?

798
01:04:28,675 --> 01:04:31,177
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really what marketing people think gamers are?

799
01:04:31,497 --> 01:04:39,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And for Sony to come out and say, I guess we were too funky fresh for you, that's like when grandma says something about... Who says funky fresh?

800
01:04:39,902 --> 01:04:43,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow, that was really the bee's knees trying to be cool like you.

801
01:04:44,185 --> 01:04:47,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going like, you people really don't get it.

802
01:04:48,144 --> 01:05:17,166
[SPEAKER_03]: and the thing too about it is they're all using they had a bunch of fake comments on there too by people saying oh this is the best site ever and then like using number two for every time they said two and just trying to fake that leet speak or whatever on their website and why the fuck do they create a website other than to get buzz and stuff about the PSP but it's just

803
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:27,016
[SPEAKER_03]: to create a fake website, you know, with a bunch of people saying, oh, the PSP's awesome and stuff like that, it's just, it's really dirty, I don't know, it just seems like...

804
01:05:27,797 --> 01:05:32,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see Nintendo making fake websites going, oh, the Wii is awesome and stuff.

805
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,082
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to make up that publicity.

806
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:41,586
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the PSP and the PlayStation 3 have been having a big problem with their marketing campaigns.

807
01:05:41,706 --> 01:05:44,408
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I got some comments from the chat room I have to read here.

808
01:05:45,328 --> 01:05:47,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Crispy says, at least they fessed up.

809
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:48,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?

810
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of feel like they had to fess up.

811
01:05:50,211 --> 01:05:50,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously?

812
01:05:51,271 --> 01:06:01,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony was caught with not only their pants down, but their boxers down too, so the world could see what an incredibly tiny, tiny penis Sony had when it came to the PSP.

813
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:14,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Because seriously, that's kind of what it boils down to right now, is that Sony's probably a little pissed that people are all hyped about Wii and DS and da-da-da-da-da, and that there wasn't a legitimate blog out there for PSP rabid fandom.

814
01:06:15,276 --> 01:06:16,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So they created this.

815
01:06:16,876 --> 01:06:24,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see, Funnydale in our chatroom says, I hate to break the news to you guys, but every video game commercial makes gamers look like a bunch of losers.

816
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:27,085
[SPEAKER_02]: What, Chris, you say that's not true?

817
01:06:27,426 --> 01:06:28,106
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not true.

818
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:28,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get that.

819
01:06:28,847 --> 01:06:30,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get that when I see those.

820
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:31,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.

821
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:33,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it depends on what commercial I'm looking at.

822
01:06:34,252 --> 01:06:39,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I kind of like the Wii commercials, but then again, the Wii appeals to those that are not gamers, so...

823
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I think... Yeah, I don't know.

824
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:45,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's look at... I can see where he's getting that comment from, though.

825
01:06:45,843 --> 01:06:49,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It has taken the society a long time to get gamers, you know what I mean?

826
01:06:49,566 --> 01:06:57,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it really... Like, the PlayStation commercials, like, for both the PSP and the PlayStation 3, I never really got them.

827
01:06:57,691 --> 01:07:03,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and I always knew that they had a problem with their marketing firms, because look at the way they're advertising.

828
01:07:03,335 --> 01:07:10,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, the PSP, they have two stick figures, or not stick figures, but, like, you know, sketch drawings of, like, dust bunnies or whatever...

829
01:07:10,936 --> 01:07:15,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Like talking about random shit, you know, and they're all PSP.

830
01:07:15,558 --> 01:07:16,898
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, nuts.

831
01:07:17,239 --> 01:07:19,459
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a nut you can play outside or something like that.

832
01:07:19,479 --> 01:07:20,760
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make any sense.

833
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Nor do the PlayStation 3 commercials.

834
01:07:23,241 --> 01:07:25,762
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in the room with the, you know, PlayStation 3, you know.

835
01:07:26,383 --> 01:07:27,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

836
01:07:52,887 --> 01:07:58,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Flaming Bozo in our chatroom says, No, the commercials for gaming colleges make us look stupid.

837
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:00,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, those are awful.

838
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you for citing a commercial.

839
01:08:01,751 --> 01:08:04,412
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right, that one does make gamers look pretty stupid.

840
01:08:04,712 --> 01:08:12,076
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think people need to get the concept of, and this is one of those things I feel like, you know, at least in the Wii marketing, and again, I'm not talking about the systems, I'm talking about the marketing.

841
01:08:12,316 --> 01:08:15,697
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Wii marketing, it's kind of got that gamers are everybody.

842
01:08:16,078 --> 01:08:17,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Who enjoys movies?

843
01:08:17,778 --> 01:08:18,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody.

844
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:19,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Who listens to music?

845
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:20,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody.

846
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody.

847
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Shouldn't games be accessible to everybody too?

848
01:08:24,143 --> 01:08:24,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

849
01:08:24,623 --> 01:08:25,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of thing?

850
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:25,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

851
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:26,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

852
01:08:26,164 --> 01:08:27,285
[SPEAKER_02]: One would hope.

853
01:08:27,546 --> 01:08:30,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, real quick question, then we'll get to another story here.

854
01:08:30,028 --> 01:08:34,312
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to go around the room and ask, yes or no, and any other thing you want to say.

855
01:08:34,832 --> 01:08:41,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony should fire any company related to their marketing right now and start with new companies around the board.

856
01:08:41,398 --> 01:08:45,302
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, Sony should just axe everything to do with their marketing right now and start anew in 2007.

857
01:08:45,342 --> 01:08:45,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes or no?

858
01:08:47,946 --> 01:09:01,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be a good idea to not only get new marketers, I mean, get some people that actually know how to market this stuff, like the people behind Burger King, or even like Geico, just like people that come up with really creative marketing campaigns.

859
01:09:02,258 --> 01:09:03,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, that's great.

860
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:05,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some of those people to help you out.

861
01:09:05,581 --> 01:09:11,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, get your higher-ups to shut the fuck up, because they keep ruining any good marketing that you do for yourselves.

862
01:09:12,366 --> 01:09:13,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what they need to do.

863
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I think companies have a really...

864
01:09:16,741 --> 01:09:19,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy idea what viral marketing is.

865
01:09:20,622 --> 01:09:21,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, yes or no?

866
01:09:21,402 --> 01:09:22,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony needs to fire all their marketers.

867
01:09:23,903 --> 01:09:33,526
[SPEAKER_07]: To take this from a business point of view, that would actually be pretty damn illogical to expect them to because they have contracts set up with these.

868
01:09:34,726 --> 01:09:46,530
[SPEAKER_07]: What they need to do is have more express control, you know, better, I'd say better QA with what goes on, with what's marketed, more involvement with this, you know,

869
01:09:47,296 --> 01:09:49,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's look at this realistically.

870
01:09:49,038 --> 01:09:55,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Because honestly, anything that their marketing firms come up with, doesn't Sony have to approve?

871
01:09:57,005 --> 01:10:00,608
[SPEAKER_07]: So somebody at Sony approved these.

872
01:10:01,149 --> 01:10:04,552
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to find whoever was in charge of approving it and fire them.

873
01:10:06,133 --> 01:10:08,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a structural reorganization.

874
01:10:09,036 --> 01:10:10,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Structural reorganization, yes.

875
01:10:10,677 --> 01:10:11,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Either that or...

876
01:10:12,106 --> 01:10:16,648
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't like to talk about people getting killed or fired or anything, but structural reorganization is a need.

877
01:10:16,808 --> 01:10:17,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Or hire me.

878
01:10:19,189 --> 01:10:20,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you save Sony?

879
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:21,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I am brilliant.

880
01:10:21,369 --> 01:10:22,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I would save Sony's ass.

881
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:23,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

882
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:24,030
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm sorry.

883
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:25,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you, Jamie, but damn.

884
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:28,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would be like PlayStation 3 starts fires.

885
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:29,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire, fire, fire.

886
01:10:29,472 --> 01:10:30,273
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no.

887
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:33,314
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be PlayStation 3 presented by Sega.

888
01:10:34,014 --> 01:10:40,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's what they really need to do, and they really need to just focus on

889
01:10:40,931 --> 01:10:43,293
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes the system good?

890
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It plays games.

891
01:10:45,855 --> 01:10:47,557
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great for gaming and stuff.

892
01:10:47,917 --> 01:10:52,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe show off the 6-axis controller and how it's used in games and stuff like that.

893
01:10:52,721 --> 01:10:59,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe just focus on what the system offers instead of just these really cryptic fucking commercials.

894
01:11:00,067 --> 01:11:07,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the PSP, they need to fucking get some good marketing behind this thing because right now, they're hoping Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops is good.

895
01:11:07,694 --> 01:11:08,995
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a system seller, but

896
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anyone really knows what's a good game on the PSP.

897
01:11:13,021 --> 01:11:15,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe word needs to get out there that maybe it's Metal Gear.

898
01:11:15,502 --> 01:11:17,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying not to be like a Sony hate fest.

899
01:11:17,743 --> 01:11:19,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe some of you guys are.

900
01:11:19,283 --> 01:11:23,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to see this be like a total Sony hate fest because there are, you know, like I said, I love Luminous 2 every cent extra.

901
01:11:23,925 --> 01:11:25,786
[SPEAKER_02]: There are good things I like about the PSP.

902
01:11:26,146 --> 01:11:28,487
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that, boy, your marketing sucks right now.

903
01:11:29,947 --> 01:11:32,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of their commercials and print materials have been decent.

904
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:38,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if I were to answer this question, I would say whoever was behind this whole thing, definitely structural reorganization.

905
01:11:39,092 --> 01:11:42,294
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it comes to, you know, some of their marketing hasn't been bad.

906
01:11:42,314 --> 01:11:45,996
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened to the really cool marketing that they had at E3, like the Play Beyond stuff?

907
01:11:46,517 --> 01:11:47,497
[SPEAKER_07]: That stuff was cool.

908
01:11:47,517 --> 01:11:48,418
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have stuck with that.

909
01:11:48,478 --> 01:11:53,681
[SPEAKER_07]: But see, my marketing scheme for the PlayStation 3 would start off with fire in the commercial.

910
01:11:54,642 --> 01:11:54,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

911
01:11:55,962 --> 01:11:56,283
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

912
01:11:56,863 --> 01:12:00,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony needs to hire Jamie to be their Major Nelson.

913
01:12:00,465 --> 01:12:01,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Sergeant Sakura.

914
01:12:01,506 --> 01:12:01,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

915
01:12:03,137 --> 01:12:04,318
[SPEAKER_07]: It would start off with fire.

916
01:12:05,938 --> 01:12:08,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there would be some more explosions in the background.

917
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:15,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And then... This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, your PlayStation 3 will be on fire!

918
01:12:16,544 --> 01:12:17,404
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no.

919
01:12:17,924 --> 01:12:21,886
[SPEAKER_07]: There'd be like a fence in the background, like a chain link fence.

920
01:12:22,847 --> 01:12:26,289
[SPEAKER_07]: And there'd be like all these really awesome people walking around with PlayStation 3s.

921
01:12:27,401 --> 01:12:30,424
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the announcer going, buy a PlayStation 3, dammit!

922
01:12:30,865 --> 01:12:38,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I gotta let Chris comment on this being the, you know, one who maybe isn't as into consoles as the rest of us.

923
01:12:39,173 --> 01:12:40,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony needs to fire them all, yes or no?

924
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:48,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, well, realistically, we all know they're not going to, because like somebody said, I think it was Jamie, they got contracts, um...

925
01:12:49,818 --> 01:13:11,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they should get fired but someone definitely needs to go I nominate Jamie for this someone needs to go in there and like bitch slap them because I think what they're doing gladly yeah I know I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm reading chat room and these comments are too good to pass up hold on let Chris finish your thought yeah the chat room upped me it's okay no I'm sorry finish your thought go go go quick okay

926
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:17,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Fireboma has an idea for a campaign, and that is the PlayStation 3 campaign will go something like this.

927
01:13:18,181 --> 01:13:19,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Only faggots buy a Wii.

928
01:13:22,543 --> 01:13:25,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, look, I am gay, so I can laugh at that.

929
01:13:25,244 --> 01:13:26,025
[SPEAKER_02]: That is kind of funny.

930
01:13:27,425 --> 01:13:30,126
[SPEAKER_05]: If you buy a Wii, that means you like it in the ass.

931
01:13:31,187 --> 01:13:33,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox, this will be the other commercial.

932
01:13:33,628 --> 01:13:36,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360 owners are fat and retarded.

933
01:13:36,389 --> 01:13:37,889
[SPEAKER_02]: You aren't fat and retarded, are you?

934
01:13:42,421 --> 01:13:42,841
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

935
01:13:43,401 --> 01:13:44,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Sergeant Firebomba, everybody.

936
01:13:45,522 --> 01:13:49,604
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have the Wii 60, does it mean that you're a big fat dyke?

937
01:13:49,965 --> 01:13:53,206
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, honestly, even though... That means you like fried chicken.

938
01:13:53,766 --> 01:13:58,088
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though that is so offensive, I would still think that's a better advertisement.

939
01:13:58,168 --> 01:13:59,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I would laugh at that.

940
01:13:59,109 --> 01:13:59,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

941
01:13:59,709 --> 01:14:01,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I would at least laugh at that.

942
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:08,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if I saw a commercial come on TV, like, you think I should be offended, you know, being gay and all, but I would probably laugh.

943
01:14:08,553 --> 01:14:11,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'd be all, that's better than the all-I-want breakfast is a PSP thing.

944
01:14:13,368 --> 01:14:15,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm laughing so hard, that's great.

945
01:14:15,689 --> 01:14:17,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just thinking of the hate mail that's going to come in.

946
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:19,290
[SPEAKER_07]: New ad scheme, new ad scheme.

947
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:21,371
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys should not be using those words on the air.

948
01:14:22,411 --> 01:14:23,552
[SPEAKER_07]: So what?

949
01:14:23,612 --> 01:14:25,472
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a mature rating.

950
01:14:25,592 --> 01:14:26,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, whatever, whatever.

951
01:14:26,913 --> 01:14:28,633
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the ad scheme would be this.

952
01:14:29,754 --> 01:14:31,254
[SPEAKER_07]: You just have a black screen, yeah?

953
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:33,475
[SPEAKER_07]: And a PlayStation 3 shows up.

954
01:14:33,915 --> 01:14:35,516
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you want one.

955
01:14:36,156 --> 01:14:36,956
[SPEAKER_07]: We're Sony.

956
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:38,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Kiss our ass.

957
01:14:38,737 --> 01:14:40,257
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, I got one here.

958
01:14:40,318 --> 01:14:41,558
I got one here, I got one here, I'm sorry.

959
01:14:41,994 --> 01:14:44,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy a PlayStation 3 or we will kill you!

960
01:14:44,635 --> 01:14:45,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, hold on.

961
01:14:45,556 --> 01:14:46,416
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting too crazy here.

962
01:14:46,436 --> 01:14:47,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

963
01:14:47,617 --> 01:14:48,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put a call out to the listeners.

964
01:14:49,538 --> 01:14:51,099
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a voicemail system, right?

965
01:14:52,379 --> 01:14:53,500
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a homework assignment.

966
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll even turn this into a giveaway.

967
01:14:56,801 --> 01:14:57,262
[SPEAKER_02]: This is it.

968
01:14:58,122 --> 01:14:59,843
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you to leave a voicemail.

969
01:14:59,923 --> 01:15:00,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Not now.

970
01:15:00,403 --> 01:15:02,564
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're listening live to us on Sunday, please don't call now.

971
01:15:02,624 --> 01:15:05,346
[SPEAKER_02]: But call after when the podcast feed hits.

972
01:15:05,386 --> 01:15:05,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Call.

973
01:15:06,066 --> 01:15:09,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave your best 30-second Sony commercial.

974
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:09,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

975
01:15:10,723 --> 01:15:17,890
[SPEAKER_02]: The winner, the one that persuades us to buy a Sony product the most, we will send something from our prize pool somewhere.

976
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:19,632
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll dig something up.

977
01:15:19,692 --> 01:15:20,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

978
01:15:20,413 --> 01:15:22,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a paper for Rob's bathroom.

979
01:15:22,215 --> 01:15:22,495
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

980
01:15:22,575 --> 01:15:23,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway.

981
01:15:23,636 --> 01:15:23,916
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

982
01:15:25,197 --> 01:15:26,138
[SPEAKER_02]: So get to it.

983
01:15:26,579 --> 01:15:33,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave your 30-second voicemails, and we'll play our favorites when we come back live here on Orange Lounge Radio.

984
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:34,727
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

985
01:15:35,595 --> 01:15:37,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Feral Trade Commission on Monday said that companies would be required to

986
01:15:55,219 --> 01:15:58,281
[SPEAKER_03]: to disclose ties of word-of-mouth marketing campaigns.

987
01:15:58,341 --> 01:16:07,048
[SPEAKER_03]: These fake grassroots efforts, dubbed astro-surfing by critics, hire people to endorse products as themselves rather than respective companies.

988
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:20,458
[SPEAKER_03]: So, actually it's pretty cool that they're doing this, and I do think it's something, because I always see when they're advertising different games and stuff, all these viral marketing campaigns, and

989
01:16:21,548 --> 01:16:23,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think people know what viral marketing is.

990
01:16:23,289 --> 01:16:31,214
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not supposed to know that you're being marketed to not by saying, look, I'm a site called I love such and such game or something.

991
01:16:31,734 --> 01:16:33,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Barbie Horse Adventures.

992
01:16:34,076 --> 01:16:36,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And having a bunch of people saying, yeah, that game rocks.

993
01:16:36,677 --> 01:16:37,958
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not viral marketing.

994
01:16:37,998 --> 01:16:41,020
[SPEAKER_03]: That is basically lying to people.

995
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:45,102
[SPEAKER_03]: A viral marketing campaign is saying, Barbie's saying, oh, come try out my new horse game.

996
01:16:45,362 --> 01:16:46,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting an email like that or something.

997
01:16:47,283 --> 01:16:48,364
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a little bit different.

998
01:16:49,569 --> 01:16:53,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get emails from Barbie.

999
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't I sign up for that?

1000
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:58,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Be a dirty whore.

1001
01:16:58,731 --> 01:17:00,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Alternate Reality Gaming.

1002
01:17:00,171 --> 01:17:05,492
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another good marketing campaign because it gets people involved and it's kind of some mystery to it.

1003
01:17:06,932 --> 01:17:08,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a really good way to do that.

1004
01:17:08,512 --> 01:17:15,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Isle of Bees, the whole Xbox 360 campaigns that they did, the Hex 168 or whatever it was.

1005
01:17:18,075 --> 01:17:23,999
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good marketing, but I guess when you have retarded marketing companies working for you, that's all they can come up with.

1006
01:17:24,579 --> 01:17:26,701
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I forgot to give you the voicemail number.

1007
01:17:26,761 --> 01:17:30,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of a good lapse of judgment, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1008
01:17:30,403 --> 01:17:31,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That's toll-free in the U.S.

1009
01:17:31,464 --> 01:17:31,964
[SPEAKER_02]: and Canada.

1010
01:17:32,345 --> 01:17:32,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, U.K.

1011
01:17:33,025 --> 01:17:34,186
[SPEAKER_02]: listeners, you'd have to pay.

1012
01:17:34,306 --> 01:17:38,529
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could do it the free way if you use Skype, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1013
01:17:38,849 --> 01:17:40,871
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just give us a call there, download the program.

1014
01:17:40,891 --> 01:17:42,532
[SPEAKER_02]: More information on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1015
01:17:42,772 --> 01:17:43,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on Interact With Us.

1016
01:17:44,253 --> 01:17:45,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I thought of another idea.

1017
01:17:45,654 --> 01:17:45,954
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

1018
01:17:46,835 --> 01:17:47,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Ad campaigns.

1019
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:48,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Going back to that.

1020
01:17:49,273 --> 01:17:49,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1021
01:17:50,154 --> 01:17:52,017
[SPEAKER_07]: A giant crab comes out clutching a PlayStation 3.

1022
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:54,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I would laugh at that.

1023
01:17:54,981 --> 01:17:55,963
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

1024
01:17:56,323 --> 01:17:58,867
[SPEAKER_07]: And the slogan is, buy a PS3, get crabs.

1025
01:18:01,297 --> 01:18:02,178
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome, chat room.

1026
01:18:02,198 --> 01:18:02,378
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1027
01:18:27,862 --> 01:18:28,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So hey, my turn, right?

1028
01:18:29,283 --> 01:18:30,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, yes, now you can go.

1029
01:18:30,824 --> 01:18:31,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1030
01:18:32,464 --> 01:18:44,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of the PlayStation 3, you know, by our crabs, they put out the 1.31 update, which adds support for Final Fantasy XI for all you weird addicts.

1031
01:18:46,531 --> 01:18:56,016
[SPEAKER_07]: The update on the US page does not state what is involved in it, but however, the Japanese site does, and based on a rudimentary translation,

1032
01:18:56,776 --> 01:19:07,601
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the installation of the hard disk PlayStation 2, so basically the hard drive attachment is going to be compatible.

1033
01:19:08,221 --> 01:19:13,924
[SPEAKER_07]: So that means you get Nobunaga's Ambition Online and Final Fantasy XI.

1034
01:19:14,844 --> 01:19:20,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, they're saying that it's not quite working on the Japanese site for the PlayStation 2 system data.

1035
01:19:20,743 --> 01:19:22,864
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1036
01:19:37,885 --> 01:19:42,306
[SPEAKER_02]: My question would be, though, would you really want to play this game on the PlayStation 3?

1037
01:19:42,686 --> 01:19:46,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know if you guys have seen this video on Dig this week.

1038
01:19:47,228 --> 01:19:48,748
[SPEAKER_02]: It hit Dig and it was all over the internet.

1039
01:19:48,768 --> 01:19:56,210
[SPEAKER_02]: But some guy actually made a side-by-side comparison of playing Final Fantasy X on the PlayStation 2 and on the PlayStation 3.

1040
01:19:56,991 --> 01:20:01,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, it looks like absolute horseshit on the PlayStation 3.

1041
01:20:01,792 --> 01:20:03,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And they show you what the PS3 one looks like.

1042
01:20:03,493 --> 01:20:04,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing it in the studio here.

1043
01:20:04,813 --> 01:20:08,076
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the PS3 is on one side of the screen, the PS2 is on the other side of the screen.

1044
01:20:08,356 --> 01:20:11,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go to a section here that has, like, a face, and you can really tell the difference.

1045
01:20:11,379 --> 01:20:13,801
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see how the PS3 one is, like, kind of like... It's faded.

1046
01:20:14,061 --> 01:20:15,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, like, faded out.

1047
01:20:15,222 --> 01:20:16,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks a little washed.

1048
01:20:16,523 --> 01:20:20,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see, especially when they get into, like, the shots... See, look at the shots of Yuna's face here.

1049
01:20:20,526 --> 01:20:23,368
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see, like, all these jaggedies there.

1050
01:20:23,408 --> 01:20:24,609
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see, like, all this stuff.

1051
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:33,657
[SPEAKER_07]: The one thing in defense of the PlayStation 3 side is the colors seem a bit more normalized, not over-contrasted.

1052
01:20:34,255 --> 01:20:34,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1053
01:20:34,915 --> 01:20:41,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway, what basically is going on here is that, you know, they're saying this could be really fixed with just a simple firmware update.

1054
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:47,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, that's all they really had to do to get rid of the jaggeds and the artifacts that are there, but nothing yet.

1055
01:20:47,564 --> 01:20:50,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it was one of those things that was overlooked to get the system out on time.

1056
01:20:50,686 --> 01:21:01,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I do think... I'd have to see other games to compare it, honestly, but I do like... Some of the backgrounds looked more washed out, but I think for skin tones...

1057
01:21:03,185 --> 01:21:03,946
[SPEAKER_07]: It was clearer.

1058
01:21:04,086 --> 01:21:07,047
[SPEAKER_07]: The skin tones were more realistic and accurate.

1059
01:21:07,347 --> 01:21:07,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1060
01:21:07,707 --> 01:21:09,468
[SPEAKER_02]: You're being more forgiving than most of the internet was.

1061
01:21:09,748 --> 01:21:12,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then again, I'm taking it from an artist's point of view.

1062
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:13,950
[SPEAKER_07]: There are more dragonies.

1063
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:15,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's also, you know, it's YouTube.

1064
01:21:16,131 --> 01:21:17,292
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be the best quality.

1065
01:21:17,732 --> 01:21:19,933
[SPEAKER_02]: But, look, you got a PS3.

1066
01:21:19,953 --> 01:21:22,254
[SPEAKER_02]: You should go home and try for yourself and let us know.

1067
01:21:23,655 --> 01:21:24,675
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to borrow my Final Fantasy X?

1068
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:28,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I have Final Fantasy X!

1069
01:21:28,097 --> 01:21:29,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I just went checking.

1070
01:21:29,478 --> 01:21:30,138
[SPEAKER_07]: God, Rob.

1071
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:31,819
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously, though.

1072
01:21:33,412 --> 01:21:36,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that would be good because all I have to do is switch my channels.

1073
01:21:36,615 --> 01:21:37,555
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually did that.

1074
01:21:37,836 --> 01:21:43,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan and I did that a long time ago with our Saturn and the PlayStation for Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

1075
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:44,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1076
01:21:45,021 --> 01:21:53,787
[SPEAKER_07]: It turned out that the Saturn version had better sound and the 2D effects were better, but the PlayStation had better 3D, so that was our comparison.

1077
01:21:54,067 --> 01:21:54,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I could do that again.

1078
01:21:55,268 --> 01:21:55,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Try it with other games.

1079
01:21:56,249 --> 01:21:56,949
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be kind of fun.

1080
01:21:57,190 --> 01:22:00,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'd have to find duplicates of some of the games, but I could do that.

1081
01:22:01,331 --> 01:22:03,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, sorry, I keep playing the video there in the background.

1082
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:04,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get the link there for chat.

1083
01:22:05,853 --> 01:22:10,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they do this little, like, unnecessary intro to the thing on YouTube, but whatever.

1084
01:22:10,454 --> 01:22:12,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they're... Oh, damn it!

1085
01:22:13,055 --> 01:22:15,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I reposted the hamster thing in chat.

1086
01:22:16,596 --> 01:22:17,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Son of a bitch!

1087
01:22:17,176 --> 01:22:17,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Hamsters!

1088
01:22:18,617 --> 01:22:19,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Go hamster!

1089
01:22:21,558 --> 01:22:23,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn YouTube.

1090
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:24,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me make sure that copied.

1091
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,283
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great radio, boys and girls.

1092
01:22:29,303 --> 01:22:29,963
[SPEAKER_02]: What can we say?

1093
01:22:30,023 --> 01:22:32,204
[SPEAKER_02]: We are taping live, and this is what happens.

1094
01:22:32,384 --> 01:22:34,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Once upon a time, there was a Final Fantasy game.

1095
01:22:34,404 --> 01:22:34,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, shut up.

1096
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:35,525
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1097
01:22:36,745 --> 01:22:37,305
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1098
01:22:37,365 --> 01:22:38,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try that again.

1099
01:22:38,046 --> 01:22:38,426
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

1100
01:22:38,466 --> 01:22:39,926
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the link the chat room's been begging for.

1101
01:22:41,587 --> 01:22:41,867
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

1102
01:22:42,227 --> 01:22:42,527
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1103
01:22:43,728 --> 01:22:44,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, let's move on.

1104
01:22:44,948 --> 01:22:52,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, ShadowCharlie has also pointed out that you can play as Maria in the Saturn version, but you can also play as Richter, and he's not an easy kill in that one.

1105
01:22:52,891 --> 01:22:56,632
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dan just unlocked Richter and Maria mode in Portrait of Ruin.

1106
01:22:57,421 --> 01:22:57,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1107
01:22:58,102 --> 01:22:59,924
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like TurboGrafxMaria.

1108
01:23:00,425 --> 01:23:00,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

1109
01:23:01,306 --> 01:23:01,866
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool.

1110
01:23:01,946 --> 01:23:02,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'll just say that.

1111
01:23:02,928 --> 01:23:03,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

1112
01:23:04,189 --> 01:23:10,596
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's awesome that you get to play Final Fantasy XI on your PlayStation 3.

1113
01:23:10,857 --> 01:23:14,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, you can't do that if you're in the UK because it's not out yet.

1114
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:16,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And the speculation is...

1115
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:33,855
[SPEAKER_03]: It might not be out for quite a while, and there might actually be a delay on the March date, and they're saying that it's possibly delayed to May, if not September, according to Computer and Video Games, that website.

1116
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:37,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what did Sony have to say about this?

1117
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:42,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, Sony's Computer Entertainment Europe

1118
01:23:43,038 --> 01:23:55,852
[SPEAKER_03]: David Reeves, he said, well, we're still on schedule with the launch for the PlayStation 3 in March throughout the PAL territories, and all speculation otherwise is without foundation.

1119
01:23:57,013 --> 01:24:03,921
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be noted, though, this is the same guy that was saying that they're on track for releasing...

1120
01:24:04,816 --> 01:24:10,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, in 2006, spring, he says that they were on track at that time.

1121
01:24:11,238 --> 01:24:31,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm basically also saying that, I don't know, it's pretty funny though, you know, this guy is basically just giving people the assumption that the thing was coming out in spring of 2006, and then when it passed that date, he's all, oh, by the way, it's not coming out at that time.

1122
01:24:32,106 --> 01:24:33,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So, who knows if it's coming out in March.

1123
01:24:34,352 --> 01:24:44,495
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the, looking at how many units they're producing, supposedly they're done with the bottleneck with the Blu-ray diodes, but if that's not the case, it might not be coming out.

1124
01:24:45,095 --> 01:24:47,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see why the UK won't be getting us on time.

1125
01:24:47,296 --> 01:24:49,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, but this guy's word isn't enough for me.

1126
01:24:50,077 --> 01:24:50,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1127
01:24:51,497 --> 01:24:55,118
[SPEAKER_03]: My thing would be, is they're going to get it in March, but it's definitely not going to be as major.

1128
01:24:55,138 --> 01:24:56,138
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be like our launch.

1129
01:24:56,418 --> 01:24:56,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1130
01:24:56,779 --> 01:24:56,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1131
01:24:57,539 --> 01:25:01,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun, our friends over the UK who are going to be waiting for this system.

1132
01:25:02,773 --> 01:25:03,333
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com EarthCam.com

1133
01:25:29,797 --> 01:25:35,861
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously, you can look at, you know, London, Moscow, Japan, you know, anywhere.

1134
01:25:36,441 --> 01:25:41,184
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically different webcams in different locations across the world.

1135
01:25:41,824 --> 01:25:42,344
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

1136
01:25:42,605 --> 01:25:44,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really cool.

1137
01:25:44,446 --> 01:25:49,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to check that out because one thing I've been playing with a lot this week is Google Earth, which is one of my favorite programs ever.

1138
01:25:49,689 --> 01:25:53,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It lets you look at satellite photography and zoom in and out anywhere in the world, anywhere.

1139
01:25:54,271 --> 01:25:56,893
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the ones I'm looking at right now is in Meppen, Germany.

1140
01:25:57,911 --> 01:25:59,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, that's of an ice skating rink.

1141
01:26:01,272 --> 01:26:02,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's very cool.

1142
01:26:02,292 --> 01:26:04,292
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just basically linked to different international webcams.

1143
01:26:04,612 --> 01:26:09,973
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a webcam, I hope that they've got it back up, but it was in, uh, New Orleans in the French Quarter.

1144
01:26:09,993 --> 01:26:13,074
[SPEAKER_07]: They used to have a cam outside one of the, uh, the bars.

1145
01:26:13,574 --> 01:26:14,354
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

1146
01:26:14,394 --> 01:26:16,954
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend was on that cam once and sent a picture from it.

1147
01:26:16,974 --> 01:26:19,255
[SPEAKER_02]: This was years ago, before, you know, all the disaster.

1148
01:26:19,655 --> 01:26:20,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, isn't that funny?

1149
01:26:21,495 --> 01:26:26,316
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, but some of the other places listed here, there's one, um, in, um,

1150
01:26:27,051 --> 01:26:30,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Effort, Germany, and a few in Russia.

1151
01:26:31,172 --> 01:26:37,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to weather for Texas, Peak District, England, Jerusalem, Miami.

1152
01:26:37,813 --> 01:26:38,474
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really cool.

1153
01:26:38,554 --> 01:26:39,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's very neat.

1154
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:43,555
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's sort of, you know, I don't think there's any in any bathrooms.

1155
01:26:45,715 --> 01:26:47,175
[SPEAKER_02]: No locker room webcams, Chris.

1156
01:26:47,215 --> 01:26:47,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1157
01:26:48,136 --> 01:26:54,377
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's a very good idea, another way to bring us, you know, sort of closer together.

1158
01:26:54,905 --> 01:27:09,877
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 in our chatroom says we need an OLR webcam and I'll tell you guys it actually looks like it probably will happen if you're all good boys and girls for Christmas there will be a cam coming back to the show in 2007 I'll be doing the dance of the seven veils in the background

1159
01:27:10,854 --> 01:27:13,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie doesn't like to be seen.

1160
01:27:13,977 --> 01:27:18,381
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is the studio we're in now is a lot smaller than any place we were before.

1161
01:27:18,401 --> 01:27:20,263
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot less people and weird stuff going on.

1162
01:27:20,303 --> 01:27:24,467
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say studio, I mean spare bedroom as opposed to the living room at Loki and I's old apartment.

1163
01:27:24,507 --> 01:27:25,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're in a spare bedroom.

1164
01:27:25,828 --> 01:27:29,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of tough for us to situate a webcam here where we can actually see everything.

1165
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:33,756
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm thinking I know a good place we could put a cam where you could see most of the action.

1166
01:27:34,116 --> 01:27:34,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

1167
01:27:34,657 --> 01:27:34,937
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.

1168
01:27:36,489 --> 01:27:39,651
[SPEAKER_02]: When you show up, which you need to show up more often, Miss Thing.

1169
01:27:39,791 --> 01:27:41,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm coming up from the South Bay.

1170
01:27:41,091 --> 01:27:42,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I come up as often as I can.

1171
01:27:43,012 --> 01:27:43,232
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1172
01:27:43,252 --> 01:27:43,833
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.

1173
01:27:44,653 --> 01:27:44,853
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1174
01:27:44,873 --> 01:27:46,314
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the website of the week, boys and girls.

1175
01:27:46,434 --> 01:27:47,054
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

1176
01:27:47,934 --> 01:27:48,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it up.

1177
01:27:48,915 --> 01:27:49,195
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1178
01:27:50,055 --> 01:27:57,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to some more news, kind of in other types of game news, not about games themselves, but an interesting program going on in Oakland.

1179
01:27:58,599 --> 01:28:03,021
[SPEAKER_02]: The SFGate newspaper, or I'm sorry, is this a newspaper or just a website?

1180
01:28:03,882 --> 01:28:03,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Or...

1181
01:28:04,737 --> 01:28:05,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Alternative Press

1182
01:28:07,672 --> 01:28:17,057
[SPEAKER_02]: The SFGate is mentioning that you can go to Fruitvale Elementary School in Oakland where the War Against Improper Toys Drive is going on.

1183
01:28:17,998 --> 01:28:31,365
[SPEAKER_02]: What is happening is that they will... What you can do, you can take your replica shotguns, rifles, pistols, whatever, and you can trade them in for books and family-friendly toys.

1184
01:28:31,725 --> 01:28:35,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, how this plays out is that you can also take your violent video games...

1185
01:28:36,494 --> 01:28:38,235
[SPEAKER_02]: What about my Jeff Stryker action figure?

1186
01:28:38,295 --> 01:28:41,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I dare you to take it to the school and find out.

1187
01:28:41,237 --> 01:28:43,239
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do, please tape it so we can YouTube it.

1188
01:28:43,259 --> 01:28:44,259
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm going to say.

1189
01:28:58,953 --> 01:29:02,776
[SPEAKER_02]: That address, by the way, 3200 Boston Avenue in Oakland.

1190
01:29:03,276 --> 01:29:04,056
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right by 580.

1191
01:29:04,537 --> 01:29:08,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to send all these improper toys to the Island of Misfit Toys by chance?

1192
01:29:08,759 --> 01:29:10,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that special!

1193
01:29:10,841 --> 01:29:12,822
[SPEAKER_07]: They need the Island of Misfit Sex Toys.

1194
01:29:14,563 --> 01:29:16,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Not said what they're going to do with it.

1195
01:29:16,204 --> 01:29:16,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1196
01:29:16,545 --> 01:29:19,186
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to burn it in effigy.

1197
01:29:20,207 --> 01:29:23,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, this is actually pretty interesting.

1198
01:29:24,370 --> 01:29:27,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of games and stuff, improper toys.

1199
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:57,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom's revamping their multiplayer once we actually ran a story was it last week where they were fixing the small text issues well now they're kind of going off of some more of their user feedback and fixing the multiplayer including some of the lobbies and matchmaking and stuff like that so I'm glad to see a company actually listening to the complaints and maybe suggestions from their users so that in turn you know they create a better product

1200
01:29:58,490 --> 01:29:59,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's excellent.

1201
01:29:59,891 --> 01:30:00,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannot wait.

1202
01:30:00,952 --> 01:30:04,434
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be probably one of the only good 360 games coming out in January.

1203
01:30:05,835 --> 01:30:09,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Has anybody ever heard of the GP32X?

1204
01:30:09,778 --> 01:30:11,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, the GP2X?

1205
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:12,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1206
01:30:13,061 --> 01:30:13,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1207
01:30:13,701 --> 01:30:16,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, basically this one is... Okay, no, I haven't.

1208
01:30:18,035 --> 01:30:21,256
[SPEAKER_07]: What this is, it's a Linux-based handheld console.

1209
01:30:21,996 --> 01:30:24,196
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for movies, games, music.

1210
01:30:25,377 --> 01:30:28,277
[SPEAKER_07]: You can develop and run your own software, run MAME on it.

1211
01:30:29,698 --> 01:30:31,738
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be pretty versatile.

1212
01:30:31,838 --> 01:30:33,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's actually getting its first major game.

1213
01:30:34,619 --> 01:30:41,821
[SPEAKER_07]: It's getting a game called Payback, which is a crime caper game that was originally on the Game Boy Advance in 2004.

1214
01:30:44,678 --> 01:31:07,614
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a top-down action, 11 cities, 50 missions, updated 3D graphics, sound special effects Custom jukebox mode so you can put your own soundtrack on it And it'll actually, again this is for the UK It's going to be £22.99 Think Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 That type of game Huh, interesting

1215
01:31:08,534 --> 01:31:10,235
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I did not remember.

1216
01:31:10,295 --> 01:31:13,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this handheld was talked about on an earlier show, but I kind of forgot about it.

1217
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:18,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's interesting they have a Linux handheld because it's funny because they try to put Linux on all the other handhelds.

1218
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:19,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And the toaster.

1219
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:22,422
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of humorous to me to hear about a Linux handheld.

1220
01:31:22,802 --> 01:31:23,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

1221
01:31:23,522 --> 01:31:24,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a good idea.

1222
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:26,324
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd actually love to get my hands on one.

1223
01:31:26,344 --> 01:31:29,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I would like to see the presence of this increase.

1224
01:31:30,006 --> 01:31:33,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if anyone wants to see the website on this game, go to gp2x.co.uk.

1225
01:31:36,496 --> 01:31:38,678
[SPEAKER_07]: slash payback.html.

1226
01:31:38,858 --> 01:31:42,281
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a movie file up on there, a bit more about the game.

1227
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:43,442
[SPEAKER_07]: It has some stuff on the system.

1228
01:31:43,522 --> 01:31:48,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, actually, I remember seeing the system at E3 a couple years back.

1229
01:31:49,467 --> 01:31:50,067
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty cool.

1230
01:31:52,009 --> 01:31:54,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Linux, their logo is like a penguin, right?

1231
01:31:55,031 --> 01:31:55,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1232
01:31:55,712 --> 01:31:57,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I saw that on someone's license plate.

1233
01:31:58,534 --> 01:32:00,496
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually part of the license plate.

1234
01:32:00,536 --> 01:32:02,538
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some hardcore nerds out there.

1235
01:32:02,578 --> 01:32:05,440
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a neighbor here that has a license plate that says,

1236
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:07,631
[SPEAKER_02]: ZOMG Hack.

1237
01:32:08,932 --> 01:32:10,133
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to know who that is.

1238
01:32:10,173 --> 01:32:15,798
[SPEAKER_02]: We live in this huge complex and there's some guy with a license plate there and I'm always like, wow, it's another nerd.

1239
01:32:16,619 --> 01:32:18,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone had that said noob on it.

1240
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:19,061
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty funny.

1241
01:32:19,281 --> 01:32:19,741
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

1242
01:32:20,722 --> 01:32:22,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to give a little bit more about the system, by the way.

1243
01:32:24,107 --> 01:32:35,512
[SPEAKER_07]: It has two 200 MHz CPU, 64 MB RAMs, custom graphics hardware, decoding chips, takes SD cards, has 64 MB of NAND memory.

1244
01:32:38,293 --> 01:32:41,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you don't have to re-encode any of your movies that you put on it.

1245
01:32:41,494 --> 01:32:43,115
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll play anything directly like on a computer.

1246
01:32:43,555 --> 01:32:44,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Price on it is £124.99.

1247
01:32:44,635 --> 01:32:47,836
[SPEAKER_07]: And a partridge in a pear tree.

1248
01:32:48,437 --> 01:32:48,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I want one.

1249
01:32:49,657 --> 01:32:50,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I have everything else.

1250
01:32:50,618 --> 01:32:51,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't I have one of these?

1251
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:58,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear UK friends, send me one for Christmas.

1252
01:32:58,823 --> 01:32:59,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you forever.

1253
01:33:00,603 --> 01:33:02,704
[SPEAKER_03]: eBay, the gamers shop of choice.

1254
01:33:02,764 --> 01:33:03,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, eBay, seriously.

1255
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:16,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so last week we talked a little bit about Interlink's lawsuit with Nintendo over the Wii remote and basically saying that it's infringing on their patents for a Trier-operated electronic device.

1256
01:33:16,957 --> 01:33:37,917
[SPEAKER_03]: What's interesting though is we've kind of figured that the whole lawsuit was about the fact that it's like a Wiimote type thing, something motion sensitive, but it's actually just for the stupid trigger on the bottom of the Wiimote, which I don't know about you, but I think there's been remotes with triggers on the bottom of them way before this whole patent thing came to play.

1257
01:33:38,017 --> 01:33:42,181
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be interesting to see how that actually plays out in court.

1258
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:45,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't technically the Xbox 360 controller have a trigger on the bottom of it?

1259
01:33:45,956 --> 01:33:47,117
[SPEAKER_03]: It does have a trigger on the bottom of it.

1260
01:33:47,137 --> 01:33:48,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Two of them?

1261
01:33:48,558 --> 01:33:50,400
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the Nintendo 64 controller?

1262
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Has a trigger on the bottom of it.

1263
01:33:53,743 --> 01:33:57,066
[SPEAKER_03]: The PlayStation 2 has a trigger on the actual controller.

1264
01:33:58,167 --> 01:34:01,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're going to get very far with this, to be honest.

1265
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:02,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1266
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:02,871
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to try.

1267
01:34:03,952 --> 01:34:06,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we will see, and we'll follow up in a future episode.

1268
01:34:07,314 --> 01:34:07,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1269
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:26,703
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a ton of it coming up next in Orange Lounge Radio Part B, so please stay tuned.

1270
01:34:26,723 --> 01:34:27,744
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you back here for Part B.
