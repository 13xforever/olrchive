To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
This is episode number 211 for this December the 10th of 2006.
It's just myself, Rob Roberts, and the one and only Loki here tonight.
DarkSakura is away in L.A., I guess running around Disneyland or doing whatever girls do when they go to L.A.
And I'll see you next time.
MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
Give me more friends.
We want more friends.
And by the way, clips of like old shows are also on there.
And sometimes we post announcements as bulletins and fun things like that.
And we won't spam you too much on MySpace.
We promise.
We need to start.
We used to post little pictures when people would add us like a little game related things.
We'll probably get back into doing that pretty soon.
So maybe give people incentive to add us because we'll comment on you.
And it's my it's.
The only people that have a login for that are myself, Loki, and DarkSakura.
So you know if you get that, it's one of us doing it.
So add us on MySpace.
It's fun.
Yes.
Do that or we'll kill the ferret.
Anyway, let's get back into some news.
Anyways, so this one website, reghardware.co.uk is saying that Sony is going to ship a major PS3 firmware update in March.
And what will it contain?
We don't know.
But last, SC Europe VP of Technology, Paul Holman, cited by an Australian website, Smart House, said, new features and new gaming capabilities.
Well, that could be anything.
Goddamn people.
You know, actually, you know, it's only bad enough that we report on this because it's someone reporting on someone else reporting on something else saying there will be new things coming.
I mean,
Where is equally the blame?
I guess there's not too much to be surprised here.
What I think is interesting about this story is that if they do release a big firmware update in March, then it looks like they might be kind of mirroring a little bit what the 360 is doing with their biannual updates, right?
Because they have to do the fall update and the spring update.
At least that's what they promise.
And I believe they were doing that on the old school Xbox as well.
So this would kind of line up with that.
It makes sense.
One of the rumors, because one of the story rants,
The 1080i Fix
300 Big Macs or 3000 Bandages 60 Large Cheese Pizzas 250 Gallons of Gas 1988 Mazda 323 You could buy 15 shares of SonyCore You could take a skydiving course and do 4 jumps You could get a personal trainer and do 17 sessions at the gym You could buy 225 pounds of canned tuna
or, and it ends here on a nice on note, you could provide food, shelter, and clothing for two children for an entire year and have $150 left over for something nice for yourself.
What this doesn't address are the eBay profiteers, though.
They don't factor that in.
So I think they should have said, you know, all these eBay profiteers are stealing from the poor defenseless children who have no roof over their head, you bastards.
Think of the children.
I know.
Why isn't anyone thinking of the children?
But can you play Resistance on 225 pounds of tuna?
I think not.
At least that's what Sony would tell you.
Anywho.
You can't play Ridge Racer with 30 years worth of toothpaste.
Oh, anyways.
Well, definitely time for some wonderful street dates as always.
And like to start things off like we normally do with some exclusive street dates that you probably haven't heard from any place else.
So let's get going here.
Now there's a few stories that came out this week with games that are coming out.
One of those of course is D3's Simple 2000 series game for the 360 called Earth Defense Force X. And that's coming out on the 360 in the United States on March 21st.
And it's only going to be retailing for $39.99.
So not bad.
I'm glad they're actually bringing out some cool games like that.
One game that we...
Death Jam Icon
on the Wii.
Now that hasn't been said anywhere yet.
That'll be interesting.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Godfather on the Wii?
Godfather on the Wii.
The fuck?
That'll be fun.
I can't wait to play it.
I mean, you're going to get to bitch slap someone with a controller and it'll actually work?
I think so.
That might be kind of fun, actually.
They really do need Grand Theft Auto on the Wii, don't they?
Oh, I can't wait.
I want to be able to pull the hooker out of the car in the real motion and then bitch slap her.
Anyways.
Rainbow Six Vegas for the PlayStation 3.
One of those wonderful launch titles delayed to March 14th.
Co-PlayStation 3.
A little bit more difficult to develop for, apparently, than we thought.
Sonic the Hedgehog also delayed on the PlayStation 3 until January 17th.
Oh, are they going to make the game fun?
Probably not.
SSX Blur, which is going to be coming out on the Wii, also coming out in March, on March 14th.
And that will look pretty cool.
I can't wait.
They've cheapified it a little bit, and it looks pretty fun.
I like the cute little video I think you played on our pre-tape show last week.
It looked pretty cute.
Yeah.
Some other stuff.
Forza 2 has been delayed until May 16th of next year.
Yay.
There are some new DS games coming out, including Theme Park.
Pogo Island Stranglehold Sid Meier's Pirates on the PlayStation Portable February 26th
Charlie Brown All-Stars April 25th
Interesting.
But of course, you know, dates are subject to change, as they always are.
And one thing I wanted to ask you about, actually, this wasn't anywhere on the show roll, but something we put on orangelaunchradio.com earlier this week is that folks have been spotted on the internet playing DDR Universe on Xbox Live, which would indicate that the game has gone gold, I would believe, or else the achievements and things would not be loaded on Xbox's servers so that we could find them.
So, March still?
So March, yeah.
You sure?
Because the game's gone gold.
Don't you think this will make the January date?
No.
All right.
Still positive it's in March.
Why?
What makes you so damn sure?
Their January game is, or actually they don't have a game in January.
Well, then there you go.
Their February.
No.
They have, okay, they have games coming out in January.
They have Yu-Gi-Oh!
GX.
I want to say Tag Force is coming out.
And then, I don't think anything else.
Yeah, well, what if you go to work tomorrow and then, oop, the date got shifted.
They bumped it up.
They normally don't bump stuff up.
I'm thinking they're waiting until March.
March is the big dates for games.
It's the second push of the, or I guess the first push of the year other than November.
So, it's still going to stick to March.
You'll see.
You'll see.
You'll see.
We will.
We will.
We shall see.
And just because they're playing it online, hey, remember Pimps at Sea is online right now.
Does that mean he'll... But you couldn't go in and see the little graphics and all the achievements and everything.
Those weren't loaded on Xbox's servers.
You couldn't do anything with that.
It just showed that they were playing Pimps at Sea.
But with DDR Universe, that's how we were able to get all the achievements.
So it doesn't mean anything.
Oh, we'll see.
We will see.
We will see.
MF-er.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hamsters, also coming out on the DS, so that should be fun Star Wars Lethal Alliance on the DS, now that sounds pretty good Superman Returns, the video game on PlayStation 2 Oh, oh, I played the demo of Superman Returns for Xbox 360 Sucked It was more fun to pick up a stranger and try to drop them in the ocean or leave them on the beach and then fly away I had more fun with the whole sandbox element of it than playing the actual game It's pretty bad
I'm not going to pick up the full game based off that demo.
I know you're not supposed to make a final judgment of a game based off a demo, but seriously, don't put it on Marketplace if you don't want people to do that.
I can't put my pre-order from based off the demo.
Yeah, I can't say I blame you.
Oh, also, The Sims 2 Pets coming out on the PSP, also from EA.
Far Cry Vengeance and Marvel Ultimate Alliance on the Wii on the 22nd.
Also, Star Trek Tactical Assault on the DS, also on the 22nd.
And also for the U.S.
Oh, sorry, did I cut you off?
My bad.
No, yeah, it's okay.
Anyways, so the U.S., we've got some pretty good releases this week.
Twilight Princess on the GameCube, you know, for those who may not have a Wii yet.
Definitely worth picking up.
Holdouts.
All your holdouts.
Star Trek Legacy, which actually I think that came out last week.
Some of this list is wrong.
Anyways, moving on.
I don't remember seeing Star Trek Legacy when I went to the store today.
I thought that was last week.
It's moved around so many times it's hard for me to remember.
Blazing Angels on PlayStation 3.
Full Metal Alchemist, Dual Sympathy on the DS.
Which I hear is supposed to be better than the PlayStation 2 ones.
Let's see here.
Elebits on the Wii.
I can't wait to pick that one up.
That one looks pretty awesome.
I want to get that too, yeah.
Um...
Let's see here.
Then I do believe on the PC we've got Rayman's Raving Rabbids finally making its way out there.
And let's see here.
Oh, there's actually a few other things on the Wii.
Metal Slug Anthology, Chicken Little Ace in Action, Rainbow Six Vegas is finally making its way on the PC.
And then on the PSP we've got Blitz Overtime, which is part of Blitz League.
and then, actually, I don't think there's any love for PlayStation 2.
Well, not too much, at least.
College Hoops 2K7, which was delayed from the original Xbox and 360 launch.
And then, yeah, that's a...
and many more.
Earth Defense Forces 3 Full Auto 2 Battle Lines
I believe that the US one came out last week.
Oh, so they're getting, I guess, that over in the Asian territories as well.
MotorStorm, also the Japanese version of MotorStorm, coming out December 14th.
Bastards, we have to wait until March.
Coming out on the Wii, Pokemon Battle Revolution and Rayman Raving Rabbids.
Also, a title based off of Bleach is coming out there as well on the Nintendo Wii.
Coming out on the PlayStation 2,
Beatmania 2DX, Happy Sky.
A lot of you music game fans have been waiting for that one.
That is finally coming out this week, December 14th.
So be on the lookout for that.
Lots and lots of PS2 titles, by the way, coming out this week in Japan.
Nobunaga no Yabu.
Actually, I think that's just going into Best Hits this week.
Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2, also going into the Best Hits.
and it looks like a lot of games are getting price reductions on the PS2 this week in Japan.
So check that out.
Well, as I mentioned earlier... Wait, one more.
Sorry, one more.
I want to say on the DS, three Rockman games coming out.
Ryusei, No Rockman, Dragon, Leo, and Pegasus all coming out December 14th.
Now what's the funniest game title for this week?
For the DS?
Just for anything.
I don't know.
There's not a lot of funny stuff this week.
Oh, here we go.
and stationary style set DS Lite, although that's not a game.
It's just a set.
It's like a little, you know, like accessory.
I don't know.
That's the best I could do.
Sorry.
Okay.
Anyway.
No Love Hamster this week.
Sorry.
Love Hamster.
Let's see.
Anyways, as I mentioned earlier, the PlayStation 3 just had a firmware update and was fixing some of the issues that they had with 720p being downscaled to 480p for those people that had older TVs that couldn't do the 720p and only did 1080i.
Well, apparently there's a firmware update now, the version 1.3, which actually made attempts to patching that.
It makes the 1080i
The default resolution now, and then the 720p is kind of secondary, so for the people that had, you know, the 1080i only HDTVs, you know, kind of fixed some of that.
However, though, there's still, if you want to watch a Blu-ray movie, the machine will still scale it back, I guess, to 480p, so you have to switch it manually.
It sounds like that they've sort of fixed the problem, but not quite fixed it all the way yet, so.
Why can't it be just simple like the 360 where if it's in 1080i, it stays in 1080i unless I pop in a DVD, which is only going to go to 480p anyways.
I don't know, why can't you just manually select your resolution?
That seems like it should make sense.
Stop trying to think for me.
Well, I know Sony's been taking a lot of heat lately, but slowly but surely we're starting to hear some pretty rad things coming out of Sony, and I think this is pretty awesome.
Even though there is no price or date set for this, the PlayStation Network is going to be getting Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.
I think that's pretty rad.
Yeah, that's according to Famitsu Weekly, and Bandai Namco is going to be releasing this for the download service.
Probably Japan will get this first, but at least gives us an idea of what's to come.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
If they were to go that far with it, shit, they could probably release it as a full game and make pretty good money.
So it'll be interesting to see how much they charge for this on the PlayStation Network.
Certainly could be one of the, you know, I think PlayStation's kind of been looking for its geometry wars.
And sure, you've got Blast Factor and Blow, or Blow.
Flow.
Flow seems to look pretty cool if you've played the little web application online.
I'm not going to live that one down.
But this could be, like, the, you know, must-have.
This, and, like, Gran Turismo HD also coming out in the network.
You know, they're going to have some pretty powerful stuff on their network soon.
So, Sony, and, you know, I guess they got Lemmings this week, too.
Yeah, Lemmings, too, and it was a remake.
It was completely redone.
Lemmings, too, is fun.
I liked it.
So, slowly but surely, is Sony making some waves in the online scene?
I must say, for once, I say good job, Sony.
Yep.
And actually, Enchanted Arms for the PlayStation 3 is going to be getting some enhancements as well.
It's kind of cool to see that it's not just a port.
What they're going to be adding, though, are going to be some graphical tweaks, of course, including new character animations, new chapters to the story, new golems will appear, and the battle system will be improved.
Will the voice acting be improved?
I don't know about that.
It says even the themes for the opening and ending will be recomposed by Mink.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
HD DVD has a 46% more positive discussions when it comes to websites than Blu-ray.
About half as many people are impressed with Blu-ray visuals than are with HD DVD visuals.
I guess these guys are scanning websites to see what people are saying.
Of course, they don't say what websites they're looking at, but whatever.
Now, what's interesting about this is that they say the key reasons for the low Blu-ray acceptance is the forced inclusion on the PlayStation 3 and PS4.
Sony's previous format reputation.
So this might be kind of alluding to the fact that PlayStation 3 might actually be being harmed by the fact that the Blu-ray is a forced thing on it.
Well, just like the UMDs.
UMDs didn't really take off either.
Yeah, I know.
Well, we all know why UMDs didn't work because they were charging more than they were for the DVDs and there wasn't as much on them and you couldn't watch them on a TV.
I mean, it was a stupid format from the beginning, really.
If they had charged half as much as the DVDs, I bet the format would have done a whole lot better.
A whole lot better.
I don't know.
Anyways.
I just want to say, by the way, what a report like this could do is it could make more of those movie studios want to put out HD DVDs, which in the end is going to really hurt Sony.
It is going to hurt them.
Because pretty soon it's not going to be... And that's the thing with Blu-ray and HD DVDs.
I don't think anyone's really jumping into it right now either because, okay, I buy a movie that's in, I buy an HD DVD player.
Well, now some of my movies are going to be on this format and some of them aren't.
So what, I have to buy two different players?
Fuck that shit.
I ain't going to buy that stuff.
Everyone's waiting until one format prevails and that's what they're going to buy.
Blackwolf, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf's in chat right now and he's bringing up an interesting point.
he says HD DVD has a reference DVD that really shows off the power of the format King Kong Blu-ray doesn't really have a comparable reference DVD he says Talladega Nights which you might be thinking not really a good choice because you know King Kong was more of a like action type movie and you know big special effects Talladega Nights you know maybe a few racing scenes here and there but otherwise not exactly a big you know explosions and
Manly Man Movie to show off the effects.
What they need to do is bring out the special edition of Final Fantasy Advent Children.
That shit would blow people away.
Might not be a bad title for Blu-ray.
That's the only thing I want Blu-ray for is that movie.
GS68 says they should have used Snakes on a Plane.
I don't think Snakes on a Plane should be used for reference for anything other than crappy movie.
Anyways.
So, the PlayStation 3, Sony is of course talking about improvements that they're possibly going to make to the system as well.
They're talking about introducing new third-party applications and hardware, you know, new controller schemes like the Eye of Judgment that's going to suck.
Shit, we haven't heard about that in a long time, have we?
Maybe they went back and made it better.
That was supposed to be a launch title.
Whatever fucking happened to that?
Oh, I know!
Because it sucks as a game console peripheral.
Because you have to have this giant elaborate setup to play a card game.
No, I don't think so.
That's not why I'm going to spend my $600.
But it's the Eye of Judgment.
At least that's how they were always introducing it.
The Eye of Judgment.
Yeah, they could have gone away with the Brown Eye of Judgment and take a dump on your console.
Anyways, um...
So it's kind of interesting, though, about the whole article.
And this one tech site, Smart House, saying that Sony will launch a PlayStation 4, but not any sooner than 2010.
Wait a second, I thought the PlayStation 3 is future-proof, and it's going to have a 10-year cycle.
Oopsies.
Anyways, so, duh.
They're going to be adding more content and more, you know, stuff like iTunes and...
Blah, blah, blah.
It's going to basically be the same thing as all the other consoles out there.
They're going to offer download services for video and for music and for games.
God, it's not a big surprise.
I mean, unless they said, you know, the PlayStation 4 is going to print money.
I mean, I don't know.
I'm surprised that Circuit City ad did not say that the DS prints money or something like that.
I keep thinking of that picture I've seen all throughout the internet where it says it prints money and has the happy Iwata and Miyamoto.
Anyway, I'm...
I'm thinking about, like, you know, PlayStation 4, and I kind of think about, in my mind, I know it's way too early to think about it, but, like, what could really be better?
I mean, like, graphically, I mean, graphically, these games are starting to look so realistic, it's hard to imagine what could be even better, but, you know, I guess you never know.
I mean, I guess I won't know it until I see it.
And, you know, I guess a lot of us probably thought the same thing, like, when the NES first came out, like,
Oh man, this is so much better than Atari 2600.
Games will never look better than this.
Listen, okay, the PlayStation 4 is going to be able to put out games at fucking 240 frames per second, and it's going to be in full 2160p.
Yes, but will it have the Eye of Judgment?
Of course it will.
And you know what the Eye of Judgment is going to be used for now?
Plane checkers.
Checkers have never been so EXTREME
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And can you really imagine yourself, I bought this system and I bought these special cards, which by the way could probably be photocopied and used in the game instead of buying these special decks.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Like, I wanted to raise my hand and go, why would you buy this?
I mean, really, this is stupid.
It's a tech demo right now.
Great, leave it as a tech demo.
Then you see it as a launch game.
No, it's stupid.
Just stop wasting the time on this and produce some better games.
I like the brown eye of judgment.
That's something they should do.
I'm seriously, I mean...
The Brown Eye of Judgment
I don't know.
I can't just imagine with a brown eye of judgment when you're doing so horrible in a game, the console shits itself.
Wait, you know they have Rumble... My Sony.
My Sony.
Wherever I go, he goes...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
This is how ridiculous this peripheral is.
I mean, I really wish our listeners could have been there at E3 when they're demonstrating this thing, because it was the most ridiculous peripheral.
It was like, didn't somebody in the room, like it was you or somebody, ask like, what the hell's the point of this thing?
Like, I swear to God, someone asked the question like, what are you going to do with this?
I mean, is this it?
I swear you asked like, is this it?
Could I just copy the cards?
I mean, seriously, what is it?
And they raced us out of there.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and Stupid Parents.
This is interesting.
A South Carolina woman recently called the cops on her 12-year-old son and had him arrested, charged with petty larceny for stealing a Christmas present from under the tree.
What does this have to do with games?
Well, it was a Game Boy Advance.
Now, supposedly, this actually follows a string of crimes committed by the kid.
Shoplifting, stealing from mom's wallet, and, oh, punching a cop.
Well, I'm glad that they got him in before it was too late, you know.
Next thing you know, he's going to murder someone.
Stealing from Santa Claus.
No, no, no.
That's a big no-no.
You know what they should do when they take him into court?
They should say, so you're into games, huh?
Well, we're going to, instead of having a normal judge, we're going to bring in the brown eye of judgment.
And then it will decide if it's going to shit on the kid or not.
That'd be great.
You know what?
No, it's kind of interesting.
I'm surprised they haven't sued Nintendo.
The Desire for the Console made him punch a cop
They were, like, using their authority.
I'm not surprised.
Respect my authority!
And then give me a PlayStation 3.
Yeah, they did that with the 360, too.
A security guard did the same thing with the 360.
It's kind of messed up.
Yeah.
Gotta have it.
Anyways.
That's why the kid punched the cop.
Definitely.
Cyborg99 in our chat says, Who buys a Game Boy Advance anymore?
Get a DS instead.
True.
No one buys a Game Boy Advance.
Haven't sold one in ages.
Anywho, so now there's a brand new campaign that's being launched by GameStop, among other people, to kind of educate parents on the ESRB rating system.
Don't copy that floppy!
Oh, sorry, the ratings.
Rating systems, not copying games.
Anyways, so they've launched a brand new website called respecttheratings.com, and it's basically talking about what the ratings mean,
and how you can enforce them better with your kids.
Basically talking about the different genres of games and stuff.
Also having a bit, they have some actual terminology on here which is great because they actually define Frag defeating an opponent in a first or third person shooter game.
Like, you know, giblets.
Tiny pieces of what's left of the character one.
When they meet an unfortunate end.
Giblets sounds like something your brown eye of judgment leaves on the counter.
Giblets.
It's just like, you know, just talking about different things.
It's interesting.
I guess a good tool for parents, but to be honest, I mean, no matter how many websites like this and how many posters and how many people across the counter tell you,
I had no idea what the M meant!
I thought it meant it was mm-mm good!
M for mom.
With the tattoo.
Sigh.
Jimmy Kimmel had him and his mom on the show last week and gave the kid the entire Oz DVD collection as a reminder of what happens in jail.
Do not parade this child on your talk show!
He's supposed to be punished!
Dude, he punched a cop!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And Activision also is hoping folks respect the ratings.
They're actually surveying parents on the ESRB.
and DarkSakura.com.
They did this over a week from Harrison Group, who I've heard of before.
They're a pretty respectable surveying group.
So, interesting.
Well, great.
Well, there were some interesting guides.
I know one of them was posted on Engadget this week, talking about what you need, because definitely one of the big gifts this holiday season is HDTVs, especially with game systems out there, a lot of them requiring high def for better graphics and stuff.
You're going to need an HDTV at some point.
It's time to get with the times.
So, there's a wonderful little guide.
Actually, this was done by A&E Interactive, part of Mercury News.
They've got a guide to what gamers need to know when buying an HDTV.
They go through everything from the basics, including what the different things mean, including 480p, what the progressive versus interlaced means.
Very interesting stuff, including comparisons between flat panel or rear projection, etc.
And personally, the other thing, I don't know if it was mentioned on here, but another thing you might want to check also when looking into a TV is websites like IGN, for example, were running lists of HD TVs and possible lag on these TVs.
So you want to check into lag, definitely.
Also, price-wise, you want to make sure that your TV...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
because most of these guys are what, like college kids that are trying to pool together the money they've got to buy a good TV?
So they're just going to buy something cheap.
If I were our listeners, what I would do is – and this is how I bought my TV.
Shopping around, I actually found Newegg.com was pretty cheap.
They had a lot of refurbished TVs, and you can buy a refurbished TV.
Maybe it's last year's model or earlier this year or whatever.
But it's still pretty good for the price.
And I got like a 37-inch TV.
It does upwards to 1080.
It actually has built-in VGA, DVI, etc.
for about $800.
And it wasn't that bad.
And they're only going to come down in price.
And probably if you shop right after Christmas, I think you're going to get a lot of deals that way too.
Here's how I got mine.
About a year ago, I bought an HDTV at Costco for about $600.
And that was a 30-inch widescreen.
Now, it was a CRT, so I had a big back, and some things were a little bit blurry on it.
But here's the thing.
That thing broke after like a year, but since I bought it from Costco, they'll take it back.
So I took it because I still had the receipt.
I held on to that, baby.
So I took it back to Costco.
They took it back, and for about $100 more, I got an upgrade to a flat 32-inch widescreen TV that's pretty awesome.
It's Costco's in-house brand, but you know what?
It works great for what I need.
And the one I bought, you know, it's...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
www.DarkSakura.com
but that's about it so just really do your research and score pretty good HDTV or if you're really cheap just fucking buy the VGA cables for whatever system you want to play it on and just play it on your TV or your computer monitor that's why I did my 360 before I had an HDTV and it works just good so interesting
All right, well, we're going to get into the mailbag, but first we're going to go to our voicemail of the week.
And if you want to leave us a voicemail, you can always go to... Give us a call after show hours to 1-877-GAME-OLR.
That's a toll-free number in the U.S.
and Canada.
Get this.
Here is our voicemail of the week that somebody left.
I love you guys!
That's it.
Well, we love you too, but next time leave your name.
Uh...
Needless to say, we have not been getting many voicemails of the week, so we are encouraging you guys to leave your thoughts on the program in audio format by giving us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Thanks to the anonymous listener who was spreading the love there, though.
We appreciate it.
It inflates our egos.
We like that.
Let's get into our mailbag, boys and girls.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
DarkSakura.com
And I forgot to email you guys about it.
It was during the Wii launch and some people were playing Risk at the front of the waiting line, just like the old gamers back in the day do.
And I was just wondering what board tabletop games would you like to see in the Xbox 360 Marketplace Wii Connect PlayStation 3 online service?
I personally would like to see a couple things.
First being Risk.
I would love to be able to say to the other people, I have Australia, bitches!
Or eat that, Kamstaka!
Another one would be Monopoly.
Just seeing people's faces when they land on Park Place with a hotel and if they'd have to pay up.
The last one would be Candyland.
Don't know why, but I bet it would be Microsoft's new Gears of War or Halo 3.
Definitely.
Keep up the good work and reject false icons.
Thank you, Yuri Lover.
So, what board games would you like to see on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox Live?
What do you think?
I second Monopoly.
That might be fun, especially with the Xbox Live Vision camera.
Because then you can dress up like Mr. Moneybags.
I'm trying to think.
Well, you know you're getting like Settlers of Catan in some of the British games, which is kind of cool.
They're also doing Checkers and Chess, I think, at some point, too.
I remember that was with the vision camera.
Battleship might be pretty fun.
You know, actually, it'd be kind of cool to see some other, like... I have one.
I have one.
Clue.
Clue would be fun.
Clue would be awesome.
And I don't want regular Clue.
I want Clue Master Detective.
or how about if you could like patch your, like they could, see, you know what Xbox could do is that they could charge you then like, you know, 80 points to download, you know, the Simpsons Clue and, you know, what other Clue games they've done.
Like all the licensed version of Clue that they have and, you know, Cameo Clue and Project Gotham Racing Clue.
I think it was the Ford.
It was the Ford in the Indy Raceway with the carbon monoxide.
Okay, maybe that's kind of lame.
I don't know.
DDR Dollar Bill
of going to various tournaments.
There's a few videos of me floating around, some good, some not so good.
Seems that if it was good, it was good, and if it was bad, it was, well, let's not go there.
Before I get into it, I do wonder if I'm one of the older listeners out there at age 31.
I know for a fact we do have some listeners above the age of 31, and in fact, you know, our own DarkSakura is 30, and I'm 28, so not too far away, and Loki, you're what, 26?
26, so we're not that far away.
Bill goes on to say, I just wanted to say that the entire cast does a great job in every broadcast.
I started listening to the podcast mainly once after I got a working iPod after going through about four of them in a creative zen that went emo and killed itself after playing the theme song for Evangelion.
I always look forward to each podcast, so I do enjoy your live show more.
There's times I can't make Sunday nights due to other things going on.
What I do enjoy about each show is the fresh insight into gaming.
Not the standard garbage that some game magazines, websites tend to publish, but rather
DarkSakura.com
Being only able to get the most half of my money back is not a good way to keep a living.
I best end this letter before the chat room explodes with people saying to shut the fuck up and so forth.
In conclusion, great show, guys.
Keep up the work and see you on the chat rooms whenever I can.
That was a very nice email.
Thank you.
I thought there was a question in it.
Well, I thought there was a question here somewhere, but I guess the older listeners part was the question.
But that's all right.
We appreciate a nice fuzzy email once in a while that makes us feel good about what we do and not getting paid for it.
We appreciate it.
You guys are awesome.
Next email comes to us from Ricky
Thanks for watching!
are the people that talk with the Best Buy rep as they are persuaded to buy a wallet-melting television.
In the future, do you think that there will be a particular method of getting the word out about HD resolutions in the mainstream media, making the info about HD available to everyone so they can upgrade too?
Your thoughts?
I'm sure they're going to have, you know, well, they already have kind of, not really public service stuff, but like they have info, you know,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
I think especially next Christmas, HDTVs are going to be a big, big deal.
I mean, they already are a little bit this Christmas, but next Christmas especially, I think they're going to be even more affordable.
But I don't think you're going to see a lot of, you know, the brochures and things you're going to see are going to be a best buy.
Circuit City, the place that's selling the TVs.
I don't exactly see there being a big, you know, public knowledge campaign.
In the end, people are going to look at what's up on the wall and what's showing on the screen and they're going to go, which one's pretty?
So it's tough for a gamer because they don't show a lot of video games on those things.
So it's hard to choose when you're a gamer what type of TV would look best for your games.
You kind of have to base it off whatever in-store feed they have running.
So it makes the choice a little more difficult.
We'll see, though.
We could be proven wrong.
Who knows?
Who knows what they'll do?
All right, let's go to the next email, which comes to us from Nim.
Nim.
Hey guys, how's it going?
I haven't been able to listen to your show for a couple weeks, seeing as I finally got my hands on Beatmania 2DX and a new girlfriend.
Hey, keep your hands off her!
She may not appreciate that.
No, I'm kidding.
If you ask, it's okay.
But that's besides the point.
Okay, I feel like touching on a few subjects at hand since I've listened to your last podcast.
First of all, I'm not sure I quote-unquote hate Sony, but I don't think I'm going to even get a PS3 until they start releasing some better games, or some I've heard rumors about, such as Final Fantasy VII, or they start releasing Beatmania 2DX on it.
The war with me is probably going to be with Microsoft and Nintendo here.
The games already released for the 360 look great and I want them badly.
It's sort of along the same lines with the Wii, but I'm going to be waiting to get that because I've been dying to play Brawl since I've heard about it.
What are some of the rumors you've heard about it?
I've heard there were supposedly over 100 characters supposed to be in it.
I highly doubt that, sorry.
Thanks guys, I'll be tuning in hopefully tonight or I'll get your podcast tomorrow.
That comes from Nim.
You know what's interesting, though?
You say that the real war is between Microsoft and Nintendo, but I actually disagree.
Because if Microsoft and Nintendo can pull enough of the share away from Sony, then they could both effectively claim victory in here.
Let's face it, they were not number one the last time around, so either one of them comes up on top, or even goes from number two to number, you know, or from number three, let's say Nintendo goes from number three to number two, you know, they're
And some speculate Nintendo's going to go from number three all the way to number one this time.
You know, again, speculation.
I'm an analyst, okay?
And Xbox 360 is going to stay at number two, but it's going to be a bigger number two than it was the last... Sorry, I'm still thinking about the brown-eyed judgment.
It's going to be a bigger number two than it was the last time around for them.
So if they can take, you know, more of Sony's share, then they both can effectively win.
You know what I mean?
Mm-hmm.
So...
Any thoughts from you, Loki, on this?
Well, of course, Microsoft say both them and Nintendo take the large share away from Sony.
I'm sure they're not going to settle for number two, so there will be a clear winner, I think.
I don't know.
I think the 360 is doing pretty good so far, where they have something for everybody.
Although the only casual games I've seen so far, mainly...
Just on Xbox Live Arcade and even... Well, I guess Viva Pinata would be a casual game, but it sucks.
I mean... I didn't think it was that bad.
It's just different.

Nick S sent us an email.
Hello.
First, I would like to compliment you on your podcast.
I've been listening for a few months and love it.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
I was wondering what you thought about Gears of War because I would like to get OLR's opinions.
P.S.
Every time I'm holding my PSP, I'm always listening to you, OLR.
You're all the best gamers I know.
That's very sweet.
Thank you.
Gears of War.
You know, I thought I talked about this on the show a little bit previously, but I'll say it again.
It's a pretty game, and it's a kick-ass co-op game.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
usually been a little lower on what I like, but I didn't enjoy Gears of War as much as even freaking Prey I thought was more fun to play for me.
But maybe that's because Gears of War isn't quite the same traditional shooter either.
It's cover, shoot, cover, shoot, and a lot of the game has to do with covering.
And maybe I'm just more into the kamikaze type of playing.
Leroy Jenkins!
I'm that guy, you know?
well I wasn't really into the game either but then again I haven't really played it enough to give a fair shake yet but my co-worker just finally got a 360 and he bought actually Gears of War as well and he said that he hasn't been able to pass the first tutorial stage he says it's fucking hard and he's playing on the simplest difficulty and he plays a lot of first person shooters
It's not easy.
That even held me up for a little bit, too.
I finally got out of the stupid tutorial level, but I... You know, the first... It's just... I don't know.
Of course, I haven't... Now, admittedly, I have not played enough of the co-op.
I think that's my biggest problem, because that's where most people seem to be loving Gears of War, is co-op.
And, you know, I'll give it that.
I'll trust my friends' assessments on that.
And hopefully I'll get some friends someday and I can play Gears of War co-op.
That'll be fun.
If I can tear myself away from burnout this week, we'll see.
That's it for the mailbag.
If you want to send some emails, we'd love to hear from you.
And sorry, we weren't able to read every email we got this week on the air, but DarkSakura does make an effort to always read all the email, and when she's out, I'll step in and try to read and respond to the email.
We love to hear from you guys, and it really keeps us going here at Orange Lawns Radio, so we appreciate it.
Thanks, you guys.
Back to the news.
Anyway, so, I swear to God, I've had so many co-workers come up to me and go, Hey, have you heard about those crazy Wii straps breaking?
And people breaking their TVs with the Wii mode?
I mean, it's like ridiculous how much this has been spun out of proportion.
It's just...
It's idiots basically throwing the Wiimote at 90 miles an hour and going, Why did it break and smash my TV?
Maybe because you're trying to throw a real 90 mile an hour fastball in baseball when you really don't have to.
And it says in the manual, make the movement slightly.
You don't have to do it really hard.
Anyways, that being said, Nintendo has...
Actually gone ahead and fixed the straps.
They're a lot thicker now.
And you can actually find them starting with the Australia launch in the Wii Play bundle.
They have new straps.
And if you really want to, if you've broken your straps, you can probably buy them on the Nintendo store.
So yeah, the new remotes are going to have new straps.
All it is is kind of just a knot tied around the controller.
Couldn't you just get your own little...
and DarkSakura.
personally just don't do that crap at your own risk though exactly or don't throw the damn remote I mean seriously if you're gonna don't let go of it you're not supposed to let go of it they've got you know covers in case you know your hands get sweaty like my hands have never gotten that sweaty I mean and shit I right before I'm playing the Wii or something I'm eating you know fucking fast food my hands are all greasy from french fries so if that shit doesn't make the you know the Wiimote fly out of my hands then nothing will so
If you're really that clumsy and are prone to throwing shit through windows and TVs, then maybe you shouldn't, I don't know, buy a Wii.
Or maybe you should duct tape that shit to your arm.
I don't know.
JeremyTal1 in our chatroom says, A friend bought four new straps on Nintendo's website for $6.24 including shipping.
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to leave your own comments.
If you're listening live here on Sunday night, which we tape live 6pm at OrangeLaunchRadio.com every week.
By the way, component cables in stock.
Yeah, I just ordered from Nintendo as well, and I haven't checked the tracking of them, but last I checked they were in Portland, so I should be getting them next week.
Very excited.
Mine coming Monday.
Very excited.
Then I'm going to play more Zelda.
I've kind of held off from Zelda because I won't play it until it's as pretty as it's going to get.
I'm stupid like that.
Don't listen to me.
Blackwolf comments, Nintendo investigating the wrist traps means that they admit there is a problem which will open themselves up to lawsuits.
I doubt it, though.
Nintendo said not to be rough with it.
They did send out an email.
Did you get the email from Nintendo this week?
I got an email from Nintendo.
Bloggers got it, too, and it was posted all over.
We hope you're enjoying the Wii, but be careful with it.
I didn't get the email.
But here, I mean, come on.
Really, though.
Thanks for watching!
You're the only one to blame.
Do not fucking try to sue Nintendo because you were dumb and decided, oh, I'm going to let go of the remote while I'm bullying and it went through your goddamn TV.
I mean, seriously, if you're that stupid, and I imagine there will be someone that sues, I didn't know it would fly out of my hand.
I thought this tiny piece of string would keep it from anything.
I thought I could swing it around like a goddamn lasso.
I mean...
People are so goddamn retarded.
Okay, devil's advocate, do the games encourage this behavior?
No.
I don't think they do.
Because they show you, even like, for example, Rayman's Raving Rabbids, when they're showing you how to play it.
They show you, you know, holding the remote.
They don't show you wildly swinging around.
They show you just kind of making small little movements.
The wrist strap is around the goddamn bunny's hand, so it is encouraging the proper use of this.
And nowhere does it say in the game to swing as fast as possible.
It says in the Wii Sports manual...
And I know no one reads the manual anymore, but it says it in there to, you know, swing lightly.
You know, you do not need to do... You do not need to swing it wildly.
I don't know what more they could possibly do.
I mean, and Wii Sports seems to be the one that's been the biggest culprit.
You know, baseball, because people are trying to throw fastball.
Well, because you don't exactly throw pitches in Zelda, you know.
And that's the other huge game right now.
So, it's basically that game, and it's just people...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
It's just stupid people.
Ruining it for everyone.
Speaking of stupid, you'd be awfully stupid to buy point cards from Toys R Us, at least the ones that have been marking up their 2,000 point cards to $24.99.
That's what they're charging on the internet as well.
Now, keep in mind, 2,000 Wii points you can buy on your Wii for $20.
So, you'd be kind of dumb to buy this from Toys R Us.
Now, Miklatov, he had to leave the show because he had a pretty bad headache, but I know he wanted to point out that they were at
Best Buy or Target, something earlier.
And they saw the same thing going on there.
So this isn't just Toys R Us.
It's just people have caught Toys R Us because it's online.
So a lot of folks are selling these things online for more money.
And you know what's actually kind of interesting, though?
I remember originally when we were adding the SKUs for the Wii stuff before launch.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
is nothing.
I mean, the price that Best Buy probably pays for this stuff is like $16, and they're making only $4 off of this thing.
Or it might even be even less than that.
I think it's really like $2 is what they're making off of this stuff, and even less on controllers and other stuff.
So the fact that they're charging more, you know, granted, yeah, that's not very good, but the average mom and pop that are buying these things...
They don't know how much they're supposed to cost and they're going to pay that price.
Do you think Costco would be selling these even cheaper?
Because Costco is notorious for selling things very, very little above cost.
Do you think you could possibly get a $19 card at Costco?
You might be able to.
I'm not sure though.
It depends because if their margins are that small, they might not sell it at a loss or that little.
I mean, they might just sell it at the normal price.
But I'm not surprised though that you're seeing people charging $24 for these things.
It's just the same reason why you see MadCatz charging $60 for fucking component cables when I can buy React's component cables for $19.99.
Or fuck, the official Nintendo ones for like $29.99.
So they're just preying off people who don't know any better?
Yeah, they're preying off people that are buying these stuff as a gift for their kids or for Christmas and they don't know how much it's supposed to cost.
and I guess their excuse would be it's a convenience for our customers because little Bobby does not have a credit card so we're
And to be honest, I think it's a rip-off to buy them at retail anyways because you're paying tax on $20.
So just buy it online.
Well, the weird thing is I could have sworn I saw the Wii in some places was charging tax.
Like I saw a screenshot where somebody was being charged tax on the points, but I'm not charged tax here.
It says there's a tax thing on there.
I'm not sure if it's for that per se, but there's a little tax thing on there where you could be charged tax.
It's like a little spot for it.
Popcorn Shrimp
Well, I'm still stealing a fry that comes with the shrimp.
Anyway, moving on while I chow down here.
So, speaking of Nintendo, not a huge surprise.
They were a little short on their UK Wii shipment.
Hold on, I'm sorry.
Pennsylvania is being charged the tax.
and BlackWolf says, I must have seen the video on Joystick because they have the tax in Pennsylvania and that's where I guess the Joystick video came from.
Possibly, it's one of like 50 game blogs I read, so probably that is where I saw the video.
Interesting though.
Anyways, so they apparently weren't able to ship all the units for the Wii for the launch, but they are shipping more each week.
and many more.
You know, which even, couldn't even hit the 200,000 unit mark and ended up being 197,000 units, so... Whatever.
But hopefully, you know, you know what, UK?
At least you're getting the system on time.
Because you sure as hell don't have the places... On time-ish.
On time-ish, but you're still not... I mean, it's...
A couple days is a lot better than, say, a couple months.
Well, Nintendo is trying to make nice a little bit.
They have screwed over Europe constantly in the past, but now Europe is viewing this as, hey, we're getting screwed again.
All our consoles are going to the targets in America.
You know I was at GameStop today.
I'll say who it was.
I don't care.
I was at GameStop today, and I heard the clerk tell somebody, we're not really getting the wheeze in a lot.
You'd have better luck over at Target.
I was like, wow, that's a pretty...
It's a good thing I'm not a secret shopper.
Well, I hope you folks in the UK are enjoying your system.
Nobody answered the call last week where we asked some of our British listeners to tape folks in line that were waiting for the Wii.
No, no, they went to other game blogs instead.
We all saw the Germany crowd and Kotaku and all that other stuff.
Nobody loves us.
That's fine.
We'll try not to be too butthurt over it.
Something that you should be aware of if you are in the CPL, that would be the Cyber Athlete Professional League.
They're going to be drug testing you at the start of gaming competitions next year.
I'm sorry, that doesn't necessarily mean at the start of every competition.
I just mean at next year they will be testing for this.
It's kind of interesting because they're going to be testing for drugs, but the comparison people are making is that, wow, it's like real sports.
Games are becoming closer and closer to being real sports.
No, no.
Can steroids enhance your game-playing abilities?
I suppose some drugs could make your reaction times better.
Let me get this very, very clear.
Video games are not a sport.
They will never, ever, ever be a sport.
This is including anything with the Wii, because granted, you're moving around.
Okay, the closest thing you may...
Come to a sport, I guess, is Dance Dance Revolution.
But that's even still not even close.
Games are not a sport.
Football is a sport.
Actdeft says not even Wii Sports.
Not even Wii Sports.
Okay.
Football is a sport.
Basketball is a sport.
You know.
DarkTetsuya says DDR is a sport.
Not really.
In some ways.
In some foreign country out there... Oh, that's right.
Was it Switzerland or something made it as foreign?
Finland or something?
I don't know.
Sorry, pardon our ignorance, folks.
We don't remember who it was.
That's kind of a funny story, though, that they're testing for drugs and stuff.
There is another article that missed our cut here talking about soda highs in gamers.
Apparently, caffeine is the gaming drug of choice.
And they're talking about description.
Caffeine absorption is complete.
Your pupils dilate.
Your blood pressure rises.
And as a response, your liver dumps more sugar into your bloodstream.
That's funny.
Caffeine is, well, I mean, caffeine is a drug.
Well, they can't really be testing for caffeine.
You know, it's a legal drug.
If I want to drink a jumbo-sized coffee before I go play games, it's my right.
It's a legal drug.
I'm not doing anything wrong.
True.
True.
I don't know.
I'd love to see them taking steroids so that they throw the remotes through TVs and stuff.
That'd be hilarious.
I somehow doubt that.
Anyways, so there was actually some pretty cool stuff.
There was some sort of charity event where they were giving away a custom Guitar Hero controller that was made out of a real guitar.
and well, if you're interested in doing that, Kotaku linked to a story which basically has a how-to on how you can do that.
And I know this was also run on Hackaday and stuff like that.
The story actually comes from Toolmonger.
So if you want to check it out, it's toolmonger.com and it's how to build your own custom full-size wireless Guitar Hero controller and basically requires you to
Basically take apart a Guitar Hero controller and an actual guitar.
Pretty cool that he can make some pretty sweet looking guitars out from that.
Thanks for watching!
You know what though, but at least, argue if you will, which is the better game, Guitar Freaks or Guitar Hero I don't really care, but at least Guitar Freaks has slightly more games available At least there's what, like, you have Guitar Freaks V, you only have four games for it There's Guitar Freaks 3 and 4, Guitar Freaks V And the fact that Guitar Freaks had an arcade machine that most people played on before they played the home version So people want to recreate that arcade experience at home Guitar Hero had no arcade machine
I don't know.
It just seems a little silly.
It's a lot of money.
You could feed the starving children.
Think back to the story on the PlayStation 3 cost.
Anyway, I wanted to point this out as well, speaking of music games.
Big news in the DDR world this week.
Not only is DDR now being promoted through Burger King, of all things.
Did you see the little toy?
Miklatov actually got one of the little toys.
It's the dancing Boldo
You can press the little button and he does a little disco dance.
It's all kinds of stupid.
But the other big news, if you've been following DDR for a couple of years, then you know that folks were able to find that somewhere on the DDR Extreme disc, the song Memories was hidden away.
And people were figuring out for years, how are we going to get this song?
How is this song supposed to be unlocked?
And everybody thought, oh, maybe it'll be unlocked when Supernova comes out.
There'll be some type of link data, whatever it is.
Well, it turns out...
Sure enough, this week an unlock code was released through the Burger King promotion for Memories.
So you can finally unlock it legitimately, not using any type of Game Genie style hacks.
You can actually unlock it legitimately in DDR Extreme US.
You just plug a controller in port 2, right 4 times, up 3 times, square 1 time, left 2 times, down 3 times, square 2 times, and select 1 time.
Thank you for watching!
I think this is how they've remedied the situation that was created when the link data and Supernova kind of fell through because you noticed it was removed from the final version so there's no link data and no Supernova I bet you anything that was how it was supposed to happen but because it didn't happen this way you got the debug code instead I would bet money that that's what happened I would bet money and I swear I don't know anything I realize we have folks from Konami that come on the program but they haven't told me anything
That's my personal thought.
All right.
That's all the news we have for you tonight, but we do want to take some of your calls because we're an interactive program.
So why don't you give us a call?
I want to do one thing.
What?
Because Jamie's not here.
Website of the week.
Okay.
Oh, sure.
Well, then hold on.
I have to get some theme music for you if you want a website of the week.
Unfortunately, I don't have Jamie's typical song loaded, so you get this.
I hate you.
Anyway, Loki's website of the week.
I thought this would be cool.
They just ran a story about this thing that they've got going for Nintendo.
It's actually for like a Christmas calendar type thing.
www.mission-in-snowdriftland.com Drift.
Yeah, funny.
But it's a bunch of little mini games that you can play and it's counting down to Christmas.
and I don't know what exactly it is but each game is kind of like Mario.
What's the website again?
It's www.mission-in-snowdriftland.com and they've got a game for each calendar day and of course each one is unlocked as the days go on.
Alright.
Loki's website of the week, boys and girls.
Temporarily this week since DarkSakura is on vacation.
Raven's Dolphin The HDTVs and that lawsuit.
I've been actually reading up on it.
People seem like they're just out for money.
I said it before.
The trigger runs through Bluetooth, not IR, and this thing is not motion sensitive.
It's just through this crappy D-pad, and it looks like a Star Trek phaser.
Why do you think they are, then, if they don't believe that they have this product first, why do you think they're going through with this lawsuit, which is not a cheap process?
Well, I know that, but I think they're going to sue him because they're babies.
I guess the CEO said to his kids, I want a Wii, I want a Wii, I want a Wii.
I can't get a Wii, so let's sue Nintendo.
Oh, come on.
You're thinking because some guy at this company could not get a Wii that they're going to sue Nintendo?
That's a little bit far-fetched, don't you think?
Well, a little, but, you know, it's just, so it's this thing, you know.
Do you believe that they're actually going to win?
I don't.
One more thing.
Have you even heard of this company?
This company, Interlink.
Have you ever heard of it?
This company, Interlink.
Have you ever heard of it?
push-button thingers for people who give lectures, like myself.
You'd think I would have heard of them, but we... Mine comes through the projector, which is made by... Who is our projector?
InFocus.
Here's a question, though, Rob.
Does the Wii do PowerPoint presentations?
No, it doesn't.
Granted, you could probably use the photo channel for that, but that's beyond the point.
No, I think the fact that the trigger uses Bluetooth and the other one's infrared is going to be the end of this lawsuit.
But the thing is, though, is they have a patent for game controller device or whatever like that,
This is a patent for no remote control for PC.
I think it's going to be completely different, and they're probably going to throw it out once this comes in.
Hey, you know what, RavensDolphin?
RavensDolphin, BlackWolf in our chatroom is accusing you of stealing the Wii for the Kid joke from his show and is threatening a lawsuit.
BlackWolf?
Yeah, I am.
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry, Blackwood.
Kill me later.
Alright, well now you have to plug Blackwolf Show, or else we're all getting sued.
Fine, I listened to the night.
Bobby Blackwolf Show, 8 o'clock on Sunday nights before Orange Lounge.
That's 8 o'clock Eastern.
5 o'clock Pacific.
5 o'clock Pacific.
Alright, there you go.
Alright, any other quick thoughts, Raven Stauffen, before we get some more call?
Yeah, one quick... If I was going to buy an HDTV, I'm just going to bring in my Xbox 360, hook it up to one of my televisions, and see how it looks on there.
Twitter said I could do that.
Well, then there you go.
If the store will let you do that, then go for it.
That's what I'm going to do.
I'm not going to sit there and go, hmm, does this look good?
No, I want to see it firsthand.
Alright, well have fun with that, Raven Stauffen.
We've got to go to some more calls, but thank you so much for your phone call.
We appreciate it.
Hey guys, this is FootyMonster Hey, FootyMonster, what's on your mind, buddy?
I just wanted to go on about the whole Wimbledon accident thing Sure, what about it?
Well, basically...
If they do sue Nintendo about their Wii mode accidents, shouldn't they sue like baseball making company persons and like people who play soccer in the street and hit a person on the head with a ball or something?
No one's going to get sued over... I mean, have there actually been any lawsuits yet on this, Loki?
I'm not hearing that there actually has been a lawsuit on this yet, but they'd be so stupid, because exactly the point that FootyMonster's bringing up here, you know what?
Accidents with toys happen around the house all the time, and do they get sued over it?
No, not unless the toy, you know, starts a fire, but that's a little different.
I haven't heard of any lawsuits yet.
If you actually go to Engadget, there is a picture of a boy who was playing with the cousins with a Wii, and one of the cousins was playing with a baseball game on the Wii Sports, and hit him on the head with a Wii Remote, and he has a whole mark on his forehead from the Wii Remote.
and, you know, it's going to start happening.
There's going to be parents going to sue Nintendo about the Wiimote and, you know, their children game.
But at the same time, Wii Sports shows a disclaimer right before you go into the game and it even shows the guy spinning around going, make sure there is nothing around you before you start playing this game.
And that would...
Include your little brother.
So they were at fault for not reading the disclaimer, honestly.
I mean, you know, sucks to be the kid, but, you know, don't run at somebody who's flailing their arms about like crazy, you know?
Well, it's still, yeah, but it doesn't prevent the bad publicity.
I mean, it doesn't prevent, you know, the chatty poos of the world going all over it about how, you know, he can turn the hurt to children.
Not bad.
I'll give you that, it doesn't do any good for Nintendo's publicity, but somebody needs to put their foot down and say, look, Nintendo is not, you know, these guys are just being idiots.
Yeah, I agree.
Well, that's all I wanted to say, and just kind of make a quick FU of it.
Sure, sure.
Why not?
Okay, my little brother has a chicken pox, I never got him before, so I'm 23 and I'm about to get him.
Uh-oh, run for the hills, you don't want that at the age of 23.
So, you don't get chicken pox, you get shingles.
Oh, yuck.
Gross, gross.
Alright, stay far away.
We'll pray or something that you don't get it.
Okay, guys.
Alright, have a good one, buddy, and stay away from chicken pox.
You too, guys.
Thanks.
Well, I had it when I was seven, so I don't have to worry.
Did you have chicken pox when you were younger?
I've never gotten them.
Oh, shit.
You better be careful.
How can you get chicken pox four times?
I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and my tonsils are all in too.
And I have all my wisdom teeth too.
I am one whole person.
Alright, let's go to a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
You obviously know who this is, Legend of Zaku.
Well, hi Legend of Zaku, but you see it's radio and on the radio they can't see my little Skype screen that shows me who's calling.
And to be honest, I'll just click the button and whoever happens to be up gets lucky.
Unless somebody's like calling repeatedly throughout the show, I'll not pick them up.
But anyway, you got lucky.
Your call got through.
What do you want to say?
Well, basically, I've been... Well, I want to throw out this question before, you know, before anything.
Suppose that you want, you know, that someone or something, you know, some entity were supposed to, you know, wanted to create a game on a mobile cell phone, you know, more like they want to create like a, you know,
Rhythm Base Game What would be the best way, in your honest opinion, on how to approach this?
You don't.
Not in this country on these phones.
Don't put out a Rhythm Base Game.
Wait, wait, wait.
No.
Before you say that, I happen to work with these phones.
Okay, no, I mean... I mean...
I understand.
And you know what?
Phones are almost there because we have phones that can play the MP3s and all that stuff.
But right now they don't really do it through, unless you know something I don't, they don't really play the CD quality songs through the little Java games.
Yeah, but that's the thing.
It's not supposed to be that sophisticated.
It's supposed to be within the capacity of the cell phone.
Now, you know, I'm going to rephrase it.
You know, assuming the cell, you know, within the capacity...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Maybe it's about pressing the keys at the right time or whatever.
But even then, I don't know, I honestly can't imagine a game like that being too incredibly thrilling.
I don't know, maybe they've had some nice visuals or something.
What about feature-wise?
You know, like internet ranking or downloadable content?
Sure, why not?
Downloadable stuff, all that stuff is good.
Yeah, basically more like a game and a personalization app at the same time.
Okay, sure.
I can see.
Look at the rankings or whatever.
That's always fun, I guess.
All right, well, there you have it.
What was your other question?
We've got to keep moving.
What else was on your mind?
Well, I don't know.
I've been talking to Ranma recently, and I know this was something else.
By the way, sorry, completely different topic.
Ranma, I saw Ranma on GameTapTV.
I was just kind of curious what kind of stuff they were showing on GameTapTV.
And if you go to their recent, I don't know, whatever it is that Victor Lucas hosts, the GameTap News thing or whatever the heck it is, you can see Ranma for like a split second in this little montage of what was going on at the Wii launch.
And I would have missed him if it wasn't for the fact that he's the only black Luigi I know anywhere.
You can spot him a mile away.
Anyway, sorry.
Yes, so about your conversation with Ranma.
Let me see, I know we were planning to do, well, in other words, I don't know if you guys would, let's say that, you know, to put it this way, I've been having conversations with various other DDR players on something that we plan to do for charity.
It hasn't been set in stone yet, but we need more support and backing, and basically, in the event that this does happen, I don't know how much support you're willing to give us.
We're planning to do something along that line.
Some sort of gaming event for a cause.
Is it more original than the we're going to break the Guinness Book of World Records thing?
We haven't determined that yet.
Right now it's in exploratory mode.
All I'm going to say is that if you're going to do the Guinness Book of World Records thing, that thing's been done like six times now.
So please do something to make it more original.
Okay, good.
No, we're probably doing something completely different, like a big gathering of gamers.
We don't care about the records as long as we raise money.
Whatever you decide, sure, put it in writing, send it to us, we'll consider anything.
We have some of our listeners that run anime conventions that want us to come, and if we can reasonably make it, sure.
Especially if the event is in California, we have an easy time making it.
The whole purpose of this is just to shed the other side of the DDR community.
More the charitable and heartful side of it.
Sounds good to me.
If we can't be there in person, we can at least send some prizes.
Well, yeah, whatever you're able to provide us, that'll be cool.
All right.
Well, we can't turn this program into a sales pitch, so send me an email.
We'll see what we can do, okay?
All right.
All right.
Saku, thanks so much for your call.
Have a good one, okay?
Okay.
All right.
Good luck with your event and your cell phone game.
Yes, Loki.
I'd like to make a mention real quick that you were talking about earlier when we were discussing the Spike TV Video Game Award winners.
We didn't really leak them because they just put out a press release with all the winners now.
Oh, well, whatever.
I mean, every freaking game website had that list anyway.
It's not like we're telling you anything that revolutionary.
You know what cell phone game they should work on?
It's called Stop Playing With Your Cell Phone and Drive Your Fucking SUV.
The game.
I like that idea.
Alright, thank you guys so much for all your great calls on Skype tonight.
We are going to close the Skype line at this time.
Of course, if you didn't get through, you can always leave us a voicemail.
Our voicemail of the week, 1-877-GAME-OLR and leave us your thoughts and that's available to the many of you that listen to us on the podcast.
We appreciate that.
Alright, Loki, any last minute stories?
Not really.
Nothing that I really want to mention, I guess.
I don't know.
Wow.
I forgot to mention I played...
It was such an impact on me that I forgot the name of the game even.
The new Xbox Live Arcade game, Roboblitz.
I played that.
It was okay.
I played it for like two seconds.
I didn't get it.
I didn't buy it.
I didn't buy it either.
I played the demo.
So, yeah.
I'll give it another try a little later.
Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood when I played it.
I guess.
It was interesting.
It was...
You know what they really need to put out on Xbox Live Arcade?
MDK.
MDK would be awesome.
I'd be pretty rad.
I would love MDK.
Alright.
Well, I guess that's it for the show.
We're all out of news.
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.
You guys are awesome.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That's going to do it.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
Gee, I guess we'll start with, I guess, Loki.
My final thought is that popcorn shrimp was delicious.
And my final thought is now everybody's gone to dinner without me and DarkSakura's not here.
So we can't go say hi to our favorite waitress at Lions.
That makes me sad.
Hi, Jeannie, if you're listening.
We love you.
Thanks again everybody and we'll see you next week.
We will be live again next week with another program.
I hear it might be the holiday episode because DarkSakura was saying something about Chris coming back and Chris wants to do some holiday joy with us.
So that should be fun.
Ho, ho, ho next week on Orange Lounge Radio.
We'll see you then.
