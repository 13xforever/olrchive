14147	25167	Tonight, December 17th, 2006, Sony fesses up to a fake website, a popular role-playing series jumps to a new system, and are the Wiimotes really being Wiicalled?
33001	36823	Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36884	42007	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42507	47450	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you for the next three hours as well as my partners in crime.
47490	51553	Say hello to the one and only, happy, happy bunny, DarkSakura.
51893	52974	You're doing it differently, Rob.
53629	54009	What do you mean?
54129	55230	Oh, I'm doing the opening differently?
55270	56251	You're doing it differently, Rob.
56711	58112	Am I not allowed to change things once in a while?
58132	59253	Nobody likes anything different.
59754	60234	I'm sorry.
60274	63276	Remember, people only like happy trance.
64497	65158	We fear change.
65178	66299	And a corncob up their ass.
66959	67159	Right.
67920	68941	Say hello as well.
69161	70182	You will be like us.
70522	72683	Here comes another podcast review.
72824	74445	Dark Sakura is too angsty.
74785	79048	She is so angsty on the show all the time.
79769	80369	But we love her.
81030	81370	We love her.
81450	81950	Angst and all.
82051	82451	We love her.
82935	84576	Far Cry Vengeance for the Wii.
84596	84916	Uh-oh.
112608	113128	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
132822	133982	They don't know what they're talking about.
134002	137104	But everybody's been giving this thing like a 4 out of 10, 3 out of 10.
137284	141325	Well, and then Elebits just recently was reviewed in Electronic Gaming Monthly.
141385	147267	I was reading on Destructoid something about it, and they were pissed because some people over there gave it 4s.
148128	150029	You know, and... Whatever.
150569	150869	I know.
150949	155190	But I know just from reading what the... You know, just different specifics about it.
155210	157031	No level editing in there.
157731	158892	And apparently the...
160567	161968	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
187577	187917	I don't know.
209517	209897	and DarkSakura.
218837	219517	That's pretty interesting.
219577	224419	You know, there was an arcade version of F-Zero, which came out on the GameCube not that long ago.
224439	224759	Right.
225059	227480	And it was kind of like that, where you got in and it would tilt around.
227580	231541	I loved that game, except for the fact there were only six tracks, so it got old really quick.
231942	232862	My dad was playing that one.
232902	235143	I played the Japanese one at Arcade Infinity.
235603	237544	Yeah, but it still kind of sucked, unfortunately.
237564	238524	I thought it was kind of cool.
238804	240485	Well, yeah, no, the game was great.
240505	241325	You're simple-minded.
241785	245927	No, the game was great, don't get me wrong, but it sucked because it was over before it started.
246167	247027	Yeah, there was that.
247067	247187	Yeah.
247762	248702	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
267469	296504	and Dancing in the Rain lots of rain and I was watching Chris fall headfirst into the lagoon you know what, that was not my fucking fault we were on this little kiddie boat ride anyone who's been to Disneyland it's the storybook ride where you just pretty much sit in a boat and look at these little miniatures that are from the stories and it was raining and neither the people who were helping me into the boat were really paying attention so I slipped and almost went headfirst into the water
296864	298785	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
298825	299485	Cookie Ma!
326354	328815	Lots of Cookie Mama, because Mama will make it better.
328915	330256	Have you been poking Mama's steak?
331216	332617	Yes, I have, and Mama liked it.
333397	333737	That's good.
333957	338559	For those who don't catch the reference, there's obviously a part of the game where you have to poke the steak.
339379	342421	Describe what Cookie Mama is all about for those who haven't heard of it, because we get new listeners every week.
342441	344081	You use the stylus and you cook, really.
345162	345962	You shake the pan.
346382	350784	You blow on the pot to cool it off.
351044	353145	Some of those levels make me think of DDR with food.
354161	355863	Beatmania with food is like cooking mania.
356224	359168	But, I don't know, it's a pretty fun little addicting game.
361050	362071	Because mama will make it better.
362432	362912	To quote Chris.
363613	364274	Is that it?
364514	365175	Just cooking mama?
365416	368159	Just cooking mama and Creature from the Black Lagoon.
368359	368660	Pinball.
369524	371886	Ah, is that a new one, or is that one you guys had?
371986	373446	I can't keep track anymore.
373466	374627	We got it a few weeks ago.
374807	377469	We're still working, though, on the Rocky and Bullwinkle.
377669	381471	Wasn't there something about your Guns N' Roses table damn near went backstage to a Guns N' Roses concert?
381511	384433	Yeah, and then all that fell through, and then they canceled the Sacramento show.
385614	388896	I hate you, Axl Rose, you bastard.
388916	391117	I hate you for the Metallica thing.
392708	393929	Yeah, ho, ho, ho to you, too.
394269	397050	Oh, by the way, happy holidays to all of our listeners.
397111	400672	Happy Christmas, Kwanzaa, or whatever it is you celebrate, because I think Hanukkah started.
401213	402273	Yeah, we're in the middle of Hanukkah.
402293	402794	Yule is the 21st.
403314	404174	Uh-huh, we got Yule on the 21st.
404254	406356	You know, Kwanzaa is after Christmas.
406396	408237	I think, what, it starts the 27th?
408357	409037	God, I hope I'm right.
409217	410278	There's too many holidays to remember.
410298	410638	I'm sorry.
410658	411979	And then Christmas is on the 25th.
412579	414540	So whatever it is you celebrate, I hope you're having a good one.
415120	421044	And we should probably give an advance happy birthday to another person who has been on the show.
421064	421344	Mm-hmm.
422697	429362	Happy Birthday to Megzi Happy Birthday to Megzi
453015	456097	Loki, how was your gaming week?
456257	456738	It was okay.
456898	459199	I played Elebits.
459259	460941	Elebits is fun.
461641	463522	I'm actually kind of far in it.
463763	465324	Well, not too far, I guess.
465364	466805	I'm on level 9 now.
467345	469467	I don't know.
469487	471829	I tried playing around with the level editor a little bit.
471969	472749	I was kind of surprised.
472829	475611	I still haven't seen any edit data from anybody else yet.
476512	480495	I know a bunch of my friends have to have this game, and yet I see no level data.
481673	482834	I haven't played enough
503479	511048	Cars for the Wii that I bought for Nelly because she wanted another racing game and she insisted on Cars and a game sucks balls.
511188	517556	And I knew when I bought it that it was going to be awful and I just had no idea how bad it sucked, but...
518393	520334	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
544000	546542	And the car, like, steers like a tank.
546902	548883	I mean, it can't, like, turn for shit.
549563	556887	And there's a bunch of, like, useless-ass moves that you can do in the game, and it's just, it's really bad.
556947	558928	It's meant for little kids, that's really what it is.
559249	567073	But, um, you know, Nellie wanted an easy game to play, so there's cars, and I guess she'll have to play that.
567423	570664	Although, she's been ignoring cars and playing more Excite Truck instead.
570784	575645	She's trying to get all the S rankings in mirror mode like Christopher has.
575925	579906	Oh my god, my roommate is obsessed with Excite Truck.
580247	583728	I doubt there's anybody in the world that has played this game as much as Extover.
583988	596091	He's beaten Excite, Super Excite, Mirror Mode, and now he got all the trophies or something, so he got some super car thing that flashes when he drives and he can just go right through trees and right through other cars.
596111	596351	It's not
597151	599692	Chris, can you describe this look on your face to the listeners?
599772	600012	No.
600032	600112	No.
623283	624684	Death Stare, Grand Theft Auto, WarioWare
644642	645182	That's it.
645362	652086	But seriously, if you've seen that YouTube clip of the dancing stage in WarioWare, you know that this game is all you need for January.
652426	653067	I mean, seriously.
653087	654227	I mean, but that's great.
654267	655668	But, you know, just...
656428	659929	Just other things that you want to play and stuff.
660729	663289	Even for the 360, there's really nothing I want to pick up.
663589	665990	Well, January's always a dead month, really, for games.
666290	668790	Oh, I did play Assault Heroes, and that was fun.
669210	669631	I like that.
670211	673771	Although people are comparing it to Quarry Warriors or something like that.
673811	678392	It's not exactly like that, but I guess you could... It's pretty fun.
678672	681713	Actually, it kind of reminds me of if they did an update to Breakthrough.
682073	682934	Excite Truck got old quite quickly
703493	706695	So, you know, for me, it kind of did.
706775	709778	Like, I was like, okay, I'm kind of done with Exciter.
709798	714221	I mean, I pop it in once in a while for fun, but I think it's more extroverts, Excitements wears off on me.
714481	721666	But I don't know, maybe it's something about the casual gamer, because you notice the people that are really into this that we know are two people who don't usually play a lot of games.
721686	722687	But she's not playing it casually anymore.
722707	723748	She's playing it for hours.
724028	727891	I know, but there's, you know, the casual gamer that plays Bejeweled for hours.
727911	728011	Right.
728676	729476	It's just interesting.
729556	730697	I don't know what it is about that game.
730717	735279	Well, it's the gross simplicity of the controls and everything, I think.
735619	742301	The game really could have benefited from more tracks and maybe more diverse cars or something else, like different types of cars.
744262	749704	That's what I really think, because it comes down to you play basically like five different continents and
750501	756386	Each track kind of has portions of other tracks in it, so you'll drive on the same stretch of track.
756446	760530	Airtost in our chatroom says, I didn't like Excite Truck until I put my own MP3s in.
760570	761511	It makes it so much better.
761611	762952	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
763496	764336	I only need to do that.
764416	768917	I haven't really done that with a sight track because I don't have my own SD card, but I know Xfer does, and he does that.
768997	772018	And that's what I do with Burnout, which is the racing game I've been playing a lot lately.
772118	778859	I don't like all the emo EA tracks that are in it, so I put my own music, and I'm like, Sinpop in 80s, and Madonna, yeah!
778959	784221	So, as I'm, you can just imagine what my Burnout games look like.
784261	789482	You know, I'm flying through the air, and you know, I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you.
790102	790442	Crash!
793851	795093	That's what it's like to play Burnout with me.
796274	796595	Is that it?
797155	797456	That's it.
797576	798757	Alright, my gaming week.
798797	800920	I've also been playing Elebits a little bit.
802216	802957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
825720	826920	and it's kind of cool.
826940	829341	You know, I think the comparisons to Katamari Damacy are fair.
829381	831461	I think it has a lot of that same cuteness factor.
831761	837202	I think the only kind of weak point is the music does not have the same infectiousness as Katamari Damacy does.
837503	839783	And to be honest, I think that's really what sets the two games apart.
840143	843904	But so far, so good gameplay-wise, which is, you know, what's really important about a game.
844884	848305	I'm liking the whole discovering aspect and the levels take a long time to beat.
848425	850885	I thought it was going to be like quicky little three-minute levels.
851185	853126	Some of these levels take like 15 minutes to play.
853186	853866	It's pretty crazy.
854306	854947	Thank you for watching!
865252	874078	As far as the game is, where I have played enough of it, I think, to give a fair review, I did check out Final Fantasy III on the DS, which Loki was kind enough to give me a copy of.
874118	874478	Thank you.
874898	879841	The one aspect of this game I have not been able to review is the Wi-Fi, because no one's given me their stinking code.
879861	886486	So I'm going to have to go on the OL Army forums over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and see if anyone has the Final Fantasy III on the DS, because I'm really curious.
886526	889968	I mean, you can send letters through the Moogles and towns, but that's about it.
890008	891809	So it kind of seems like the Wi-Fi thing is like,
892332	893372	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
913410	915011	Final Fantasy V Final Fantasy VII Final Fantasy V
941827	942928	Thanks for watching!
960974	961435	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
981738	983000	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
996843	997523	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1018991	1019931	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1047697	1048518	And that was my gaming week.
1048818	1049599	Chris, how about you?
1049659	1050339	How was your gaming week?
1050820	1052601	Loki's computer just made a weird noise.
1052741	1053902	Yeah, I don't even know what that was.
1054283	1055183	Did your computer fart?
1055223	1055604	What did it do?
1055664	1056104	It went, ah!
1056504	1057005	Oh, strange.
1057665	1057946	All right.
1060428	1068134	My gaming week, aside from making Mama really mad, I actually, and I played Sims 2, obviously.
1068494	1069135	That's all I play.
1070870	1073071	Do you do any of the fanfic stuff in Sims 2?
1073211	1077271	Because Jamie was just showing us a picture of the Doctor and Rose in bed together in Sims 2.
1077411	1078732	Do you do that kind of stuff?
1078932	1081792	No, you know, I used to play just the Sims.
1082312	1085513	And I used to put anything I found on the internet, I'd put it in there.
1085853	1088453	And I don't do that with this game because it really messes it up.
1089474	1093974	I mean, they have it so that if you want to customize it, you can.
1094354	1096115	But it still messes it up to no end.
1096155	1097155	So I just don't do that.
1097817	1101441	And I just make random characters that do stuff.
1101661	1102002	I don't know.
1102863	1107087	I like getting the... Like, they have little things that your characters can work up to, so I've been trying to do that.
1107648	1109470	But I actually played a PS3.
1110171	1110631	Did you?
1110731	1111212	What'd you think?
1111612	1112833	I didn't like it.
1113754	1114715	What'd you play on it?
1114836	1116037	Well, I don't know.
1116077	1119601	It was in a kiosk, and it was at Target, and it was free!
1120154	1121495	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1148468	1149089	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1177170	1178150	It is the devil!
1178470	1178750	You know.
1179771	1188933	So, and then I finally, you know, actually get to play it, and, you know, it was like, oh, this is not bad, because I like the graphics, but other than that, then it froze on me, and I was pissed off.
1188973	1190873	I also got a little farther in Rule of Rose.
1190893	1191713	That game is weird.
1193193	1197094	But now when Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out for the PlayStation 3, though, you'll be all over PS3.
1197214	1198515	Oh, hell yeah.
1198555	1198915	Ring it up.
1198995	1199355	Here it is.
1199395	1199835	Kingdom Hearts.
1199855	1200515	I love it.
1201448	1203509	That's how I'll be when Final Fantasy XIII comes out.
1203549	1204849	That'll finally be the one that wins me over.
1205129	1208410	Although, you know, and I don't think it made tonight's show roll, so I'm okay in saying this.
1208890	1210431	And if I took somebody's story, I apologize.
1210471	1212511	But I believe there was a late-breaking story.
1212591	1225375	I don't know if it's a rumor status or what's going on, but that Metal Gear Solid 4, which was one of the PS3's big, big exclusives, some insider information coming from like a friend who knows a guy at Konami or something, you know, take it with a grain of salt.
1229143	1230324	Megzi told me that.
1230644	1234586	She's like, I am so happy that they're going to bring it.
1234946	1242029	Because for Christmas, she's getting a bunch of money, so she's going to end up going to get an Xbox.
1242229	1248072	And she was like, if they're going to start putting stuff on the Xbox, I don't need to get a PS3.
1248172	1248972	I am so happy.
1249642	1250264	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1259119	1264441	If you want to join our chat room and participate in the conversations with us, it's chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1264501	1265341	Head on over there.
1265461	1268622	We've got a nice full chat room tonight, so thanks, you guys, for sticking with us.
1269042	1271383	Some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's news.
1272083	1276785	Earlier in our last week's show, I should say, I promised that there would be some big changes coming to our website.
1277025	1280626	Realistically, that's probably not going to happen now until January.
1280666	1283987	We're trying to plan a big overhaul for the website, so stay tuned for that.
1284369	1285110	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1304548	1321740	Also, we should say, this is our last live show of 2006, if you can believe it, because next Sunday is Christmas Eve, and the Sunday after that is New Year's Eve, and of course we have respective family and friend plans for those days, and we imagine most of you guys do too, so, you know.

1377714	1378335	Thank you guys.
1378355	1378715	Appreciate it.
1407851	1410053	Alright, enough begging and pleading.
1410093	1412696	Let's get into some gaming news, the core of what we're about.
1414577	1416039	Begging and pleading is awesome.
1416599	1417480	Especially when I get stuff.
1418461	1419542	Do you want to beg for something?
1419682	1419862	No.
1420122	1421563	Okay.
1421664	1422544	Are you above begging?
1423085	1423886	I'm above everything.
1423946	1426388	I don't know what she said last night.
1426408	1426628	What?
1426668	1427449	You liked it.
1427829	1428029	What?
1428310	1429891	That's not what she said last night.
1429911	1430712	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
1430792	1431773	Yeah, but you didn't argue.
1431953	1432774	Okay, well this...
1433680	1436886	This sounds like something we ought to send over to Howard Stern instead.
1440629	1441950	GameDistributor.com
1470084	1475180	and we do keep in constant update with a lot of them especially through the holidays because we're cutting POs like every day and stuff so
1476574	1479416	But I'm going to be the devil's advocate here.
1479576	1484198	Just going from your track record in 2006, it's a little bit hit and miss.
1484238	1488900	We found that your ties really tell us the new games that are coming out.
1488920	1494282	You knew about PlayStation 3 Oblivion long before anyone else did and mentioned it on this program.
1494622	1499424	Obviously, one of the big things that had us out there in 2006 was the Konami before E3.
1499725	1502586	You knew there were going to be two DDRs for Xbox, Xbox 360.
1502966	1505107	You knew there was a Castlevania game coming on DS, da-da-da-da-da-da.
1505547	1506308	Release dates?
1506648	1508870	It's harder because the companies move them around.
1508890	1517537	Yeah, it's really companies that move that shit around because I wish it were, you know, announce a release date and actually the game comes out, you know, that day.
1517918	1524463	But that's usually not the case because they're shifting their priorities around, you know, working on certain games.
1524503	1533251	Certain games are, you know, behind in development or ahead in development or, you know, certain games are done and they're just waiting for, you know, certifications.
1533371	1533611	So...
1534383	1536624	Halo 3 coming out March 15th It has been delayed
1559011	1566382	A little bit, probably because they're not done with it yet, but the new date now from Microsoft is May 15th.
1567704	1569065	And, you know, who knows?
1569285	1571247	That could change once we get closer to May.
1571547	1574149	But as of right now, it is May 15th.
1574409	1578091	Now, that date makes a little bit of sense in some ways and not in others.
1578552	1581814	To me, it makes sense because of the beta test that we all know is going to happen in March.
1581874	1584296	That's the appropriate time frame, right?
1584856	1587458	So we knew that March date was going out the window when they announced the beta test.
1587478	1592081	And the March date, too, it would make sense, too, that they'd move it because they've got other games coming out in March.
1592381	1594983	And to stack three Microsoft games in one month,
1595461	1597262	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1613696	1619639	Trying to have a lot of... Because maybe they think Sony and Nintendo are not going to have a lot of big titles in 2008?
1620020	1623722	And usually... I should say the 07-08 fiscal year?
1623822	1626523	Well, usually April-May is pretty slow.
1626883	1638169	I mean, I think what last year... Or I should say this year, during May, the big game release... Well, they had X-Men 3, Hitman Blood Money, and Jaws Unleashed.
1638310	1641531	So, I mean, that's not really that big.
1641851	1642852	I mean, when you think about it.
1643547	1671438	Um, so, it makes sense that they would, you know, kind of push it back, because there's a lot of games coming out, and they also, you know, they're pushing to sell more hardware units, um, right now, and I think a lot of people are buying 360s, because, again, can't get a hold of a PlayStation 3, and kind of listening to what they're doing with the PlayStation 3, and how they're still having trouble getting units out there, despite the fact that they're still seeing 2 million by the end of the year, right, um,
1672381	1679908	It's probably, they're thinking that's going to be when they're starting to catch up a little bit, and then they just need something else to kind of pull the attention away from Sony type thing.
1680449	1682371	So, you know, that could change.
1682451	1688576	I mean, also Forza 2 was scheduled for May now, so there's a lot of stuff that's being, you know, delayed.
1689097	1690638	And, you know, I'm not surprised.
1691579	1695543	The other game that got delayed, though, into February is Wii Play.
1695843	1697525	And that I'm kind of surprised about, because the game's
1698035	1699696	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1720412	1723216	Whatever the case may be, Wii Play is delayed to February 20th.
1723336	1728284	It used to be actually one month prior, I think on January 19th is when we had it before.
1729286	1730588	Which is great, because I was, you know,
1730950	1731570	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1754421	1754961	Interesting.
1754981	1755142	Hmm.
1755162	1755762	Interesting.
1780649	1785873	All right, well, thank you very much for the, I guess, exclusive news, and we'll see how it plays out.
1786393	1793799	I look for date changes every single day, three times, four times a day, and Halo, as soon as I saw that change, I had to talk about it.
1793839	1796741	But that also kind of makes me go, okay, well, what's to say it's not going to move again?
1797461	1797962	And I don't know.
1798182	1805747	I don't know if it's not going to move again, and really, it could just... I've seen games that were scheduled to come out last year, and now they're scheduled to come out in 2007, so...
1807845	1811626	It all depends on how quickly, you know, they're getting the game done.
1812806	1818288	I would trust your date more than the, you know, placeholders that people use on EB Games and GameStop.
1818468	1819868	You know, they go, oh, the game's coming out 11-1.
1819948	1824949	Well, yeah, they're saying, oh, it's going to come out for Christmas because they want to sell it during Christmas.
1825229	1837092	That may be, they may want to try to sell it on the anniversary of Halo or something like that, but I don't think that they're really going to hold to that, you know, just because, I don't know, they'll sell it when it's done.
1837552	1840663	Alright, well the game will be out when it's out, so we'll see if you were right or not, Loki.
1841847	1842028	Okay.
1842810	1850855	Well, there have been some strange goings-on, at least concerning Microsoft and Halo 3.
1852676	1865543	Apparently, there was a site in Europe that was trying to sell the promotional codes for the Halo 3 beta that were actually supposed to be given out as a promotional item.
1865623	1868225	So they've had a major smackdown on them.
1869193	1872515	Basically, they are not going to receive the beta codes.
1872815	1880500	They're being removed from the Xbox Community Network immediately.
1881720	1884162	Microsoft is not going to have any involvement with their sites.
1885683	1888184	They're completely cutting them off.
1889885	1891946	No goods, no nothing.
1893127	1895128	You've been excommunicated from the Church of Gates.
1895148	1895428	Seriously.
1895929	1896569	Seriously.
1897348	1901750	But it's basically people trying to turn a profit on something that doesn't really belong to them to sell.
1903190	1904911	Well, yeah, they shouldn't do that crap.
1906431	1907211	I say they have it coming.
1907231	1909352	I'm kind of glad Microsoft's laying the smack down.
1909752	1911433	Let's hear it for some values.
1911453	1912413	There you go.
1912633	1912933	What?
1913754	1914934	Microsoft's going to have to choke a bitch.
1915514	1917515	Is Bill Gates going to have to choke a bitch?
1919015	1919376	All right.
1919996	1923237	I guess that would more be like probably Peter Moore choking a bitch or Major Nelson.
1923497	1924937	Maybe we'll see why they call him Major.
1926298	1926518	Anyway.
1929142	1931303	Why is somebody in the chatroom named Marky Mark?
1932604	1933364	That's funny.
1934425	1935425	Maybe that's their name.
1935865	1937887	Maybe the Funky Bunch is not far behind.
1938247	1939407	Or maybe they hear that line a lot.
1939427	1940248	That's fantastic.
1940308	1942129	Marky Mark, you are the chatroom hero.
1944550	1946391	But look, Marky Mark's the first to bitch, though.
1946411	1947492	Why all this old news?
1947712	1949533	Well, you know, we do a show weekly.
1949653	1956117	I don't know if you heard, but we do a show weekly, so sometimes we have to do stories that might come out on Monday.
1956537	1956797	I don't know.
1957492	1958313	XBOX 360 Backward Compatibility
1975820	1986348	Family Guy, Mortal Kombat Armageddon, Psychonauts, which a lot of folks were waiting for, Scarface, Soul Calibur 2, and a lot of other titles.
1987129	1992673	Many, many, many titles, and the list is now over 300 original Xbox titles.
1992733	1994575	If you want to see the complete list, you can check that out.
1995115	2000820	Major Nelson posted a list on his blog, or you can head over to the Xbox official website to check that out.
2003181	2003342	Yes.
2004534	2004854	Yes, ma'am.
2004874	2007436	For dumb people, what does backwards compatibility mean?
2007516	2008497	Oh, no, not a problem.
2008597	2011138	That's okay, because you play, like, casual games.
2011178	2014080	But you do more computer gaming, right, than you do console?
2014361	2015541	I don't do a lot of console games.
2015641	2017563	I mostly do, yeah, computer games.
2017683	2018543	Not a problem.
2018563	2019804	I do not know what backwards compatibility is.
2019824	2021125	A gamer on a Mac.
2021265	2021886	Not a problem.
2021906	2022446	Shut up, DJ Ranma.
2022826	2024989	No, I'm pointing out Mac games.
2037863	2041787	One of the biggest things about the PlayStation 2 is that all my old PlayStation games will work on it.
2042067	2046851	When PlayStation 3 came out, it was, oh, all my old PlayStation 2 games will work on it, and so on and so on.
2047231	2056199	But when the Xbox 360 came out, it was, well, we have software emulation because we changed our graphics chip, so some of the games will work on it.
2056799	2061682	And we'll release updates every so often, and we're going to get 99% of our library.
2061722	2062242	What did he say?
2062382	2065604	It was supposed to be every month, and it's been every six months or whatever.
2065624	2072648	So needless to say, Microsoft hasn't been quite as speedy as we would have liked, but they're trying to get more of the old school Xbox titles playable.
2072748	2073569	Not a problem.
2074469	2075070	Not a problem.
2075490	2075810	Anyways.
2076891	2080853	So, yeah, speaking of being behind on updates and stuff,
2081569	2093371	Well, speaking... One of the updates that just recently happened to the dashboard is causing a lot of stir, especially with people claiming that it's bricked their console and now they want their share of the profits.
2094551	2103593	So, as we mentioned last week, there was a class action lawsuit filed by some guy for damages basically caused by this update.
2104153	2108854	And now, there's been some actual updates to this and what exactly it was about.
2109434	2110014	The whole...
2111325	2119135	The premise of this class action lawsuit was they claimed that because of this update, they had to have their console fixed.
2119335	2124402	And Microsoft wanted $140 to fix their console instead of doing it for free because it was their fault.
2125183	2129809	And so he's basically saying that they're using this to profit from it.
2131026	2139372	He's seeking $5 million in damages, which is basically just to get them into the correct courthouse.
2140152	2147758	They will, of course, adjust the amount depending on how many people are claiming to have the same problem.
2148158	2150100	Right now, it's about 400 people.
2151301	2159747	Well, they're saying 1% of the 360 owners right now have this problem, and 400 people have come forward saying that they do have this problem.
2160325	2167787	But, you know, I think, I thought that what I heard before that they were fixing these for free, you know, the ones that were
2169042	2169643	I think so, yeah.
2169683	2170944	That sounds like what happened to me.
2193888	2202751	But I don't think that, I mean... No, I think if Microsoft realized their error, apologized for it, and fixed the machines, there should not be a lawsuit.
2203071	2203872	There shouldn't be a lawsuit.
2203892	2210254	People have a right to be mad at them and question, you know, if they want to trust them in the future, but lawsuits are totally unnecessary.
2210294	2214736	Here's what they need to do, and this is basically what they did before with the overheating problem with the consoles.
2215256	2217017	People had sent them in to get fixed.
2217217	2220058	Say they sent it in to get fixed for this specific issue.
2221381	2224854	If they paid the money to have it fixed they would be refunded this money
2225585	2229328	If they haven't sent it in yet, they would be fixing them for free.
2229668	2234091	It's just like they did with the consoles sold at launch that were having heating issues.
2234151	2237933	And if your console bricks because of that, they would fix it for free.
2237973	2238514	And they did.
2238674	2243117	Or they will send you a refund for the amount that you paid to fix it.
2243197	2246179	And I was pissed when my console bricked.
2246219	2247720	Go back and listen to a show around.
2247740	2249741	It was around Valentine's Day when this happened.
2250162	2252383	And I was pissed when my console bricked.
2252683	2254925	And I said a lot of nasty things about Microsoft.
2256586	2259207	When we say a console is bricked, Chris is like, bricked?
2259447	2261528	When we say a console is bricked, that means it broke.
2261728	2264570	So you can't do anything but hold down paper with it, essentially.
2264590	2265991	That's why we call it bricks.
2267071	2268592	I'm helping people who may not know that.
2268932	2269312	That's all right.
2269533	2272354	And then also the other cool term I like is that they send you a coffin.
2272654	2277036	And the coffin is what you put the brick in because you're sending it back to Microsoft to be buried.
2277397	2283660	I wish, though, I understand why they want to do these lawsuits and stuff, but I really wish that people would just...
2284437	2284938	Thanks for watching!
2297569	2299130	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2325587	2327468	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2355822	2357363	We have a lot of new people in chat tonight.
2357383	2358064	This is awesome.
2358084	2360066	Thanks, you guys, for coming in the live experience.
2360546	2368553	And if anyone else ever wants to join us live, we tape Sundays at 6 o'clock Pacific time, although you'll have to wait until 2007 to really pick that up again.
2368874	2373458	I guess our first live show would be, what, January 6th or whatever that first Sunday is in January.
2373498	2374699	So look for us then.
2375460	2375720	All right.
2377261	2378823	Is there any other chat comments here?
2378843	2381105	A lot of folks going back and forth between –
2382114	2385916	The Lawsuit, DDR Dollar Bill says, I will sue for stubbing my toe.
2386176	2387656	Maybe that's from playing too much DDR.
2389937	2397400	Mystic, oh, the Weird Al song that Jamie was playing in her car the other day, because I was going to say, this whole thing makes me think of that Weird Al song about all the lawsuits.
2400402	2403923	All right, anyway, let's keep it moving with some more gaming news.
2404924	2405904	But I don't want to move.
2406044	2406744	I'm comfortable.
2407365	2409546	Well, I will pick you up and throw you.
2410046	2410326	No!
2411201	2417664	Well, speaking of throwing, we had someone throw up some secret information, apparently.
2418324	2423206	And I'm sure everyone's familiar with the actress Kristen Bell, yes?
2424527	2425147	Veronica Mars?
2425267	2427148	Yeah.
2427348	2429008	That's one of Extrovert's favorite shows.
2429128	2431890	I need to watch that show because apparently Joss is a big fan.
2432510	2433070	Apparently.
2433730	2435751	Joss Whedon is my lord and master.
2435911	2437632	I haven't watched it, but I want to.
2439238	2441639	Right now, Heroes is my lord and master.
2441679	2444540	That is the best damn show I've watched in like the past five years.
2444560	2447521	Those fuckers are making us wait until January for new episodes.
2447842	2448382	I hate them.
2451123	2453945	Okay, the Lost fans have to wait until February.
2454265	2454585	Shut up.
2454725	2456486	There's still Lost fans, but Lost sucks.
2456626	2458327	Wait, wait, wait.
2458427	2465190	I do, by the way, have to thank our friends at PodCulture for sending me 11 episodes of Heroes so I can get started.
2465976	2467677	All I have to say, you'll love Peter.
2467737	2468358	He's the bomb.
2468558	2469138	You'll love him.
2469599	2470099	Okay.
2470840	2471180	All right.
2471760	2473201	Well, back to the story.
2476504	2480847	There's a game coming out called Assassin's Creed that's out by Ubisoft.
2481467	2483309	Well, she sort of spilled the beans.
2484469	2492155	She said, to quote, it's sort of based on the research that's sort of happening now, but the fact that your genes might be able to hold memory.
2492830	2499676	And you could argue semantics and say it's instinct, but how does a baby bird know how to eat a worm as opposed to a cockroach if its parents don't show it?
2500796	2503459	I guess he's talking about genetic memory and all that.
2505638	2506639	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2531491	2536555	And my favorite thing about this, I'm getting this, I actually get this story from Eurogamer, who, they are fantastic.
2536955	2540378	I just love that they call it Ass Creed in the title.
2541759	2549604	Completely, well, not exactly off topic here, but I'm officially boycotting Ubisoft games.
2549864	2550205	Why?
2550525	2552366	Because all of the games... Newbie Soft?
2553487	2553687	What?
2554067	2554668	Newbie Soft.
2554688	2555168	Newbie Soft?
2555188	2556289	Have you ever heard of that, Newbie Soft?
2556309	2556969	No, Ubisoft.
2557410	2557470	Oh.
2558638	2564462	Their last few games have really blown, and I think back to everything that I've bought from them.
2564822	2581953	Granted, Ghost Recon and the Tom Clancy games aren't really my cup of tea, but the stuff for the Wii, Red Steel, Blue, GT sucked, Monster 4x4 sucked, the Wii version of Splinter Cell sucked, Far Cry sucks...
2583070	2584712	I'm not buying any more of your games.
2584812	2585392	Seriously.
2585993	2588796	Rayman's Raven Rapids was okay, but still kind of sucked.
2588916	2591879	I mean, so... And Shannon Arms wasn't bad.
2592139	2592860	Didn't they publish that?
2592920	2594041	They didn't make it, but they published it.
2594061	2600648	They published it, okay, but still, though, I think that... They just kind of bought something from Ubisoft already.
2600668	2600828	I'm done.
2600848	2601909	I'm done with Ubisoft.
2602109	2605292	And, you know, looking forward to some of the stuff that they have coming out, like...
2606767	2619180	Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 which by the way looking at screenshots of that in the original one you can't tell them apart I will not be buying that game I am so inviting somebody from Ubisoft to come on this program in the future
2622730	2625753	Jeremy Todd 1 says in our chatroom, Loki, that's a dumb move.
2626093	2629256	Boycotting games will cause the Wii to turn out the same way as the GameCube.
2629316	2630477	No third-party support.
2630917	2636121	If people boycott third-party games, then they will stop making games, and the Wii will die just like the GameCube did.
2636661	2637662	I agree and I disagree.
2639183	2647550	I don't think that you should buy a game just to support third-party development, but if Loki thinks the game sucks, he shouldn't have to buy it.
2647930	2648331	Exactly.
2648531	2650313	But Loki's just kind of harsh on games.
2650393	2652435	I mean, God, you think GameSpot's bad?
2652876	2654518	I mean... Hey, listen, listen.
2654878	2655799	I'm not harsh on games.
2655960	2657421	It's just, seriously, Red Steel.
2657702	2658863	I had high hopes for this game.
2658883	2660905	This game, you know, sold the console for me.
2660945	2662147	Well, now, whose fault is it?
2662187	2663108	You got your hopes up.
2663777	2664718	Take a deep breath.
2687016	2687537	It's awful.
2687657	2689742	But anyways, back on track here, okay?
2689942	2690283	Keep going.
2690303	2691085	Real quick, real quick.
2691105	2693190	Dark Tetsuya, Loki, Red Steel 2?
2694693	2695435	It's gonna suck.
2695796	2696558	I'm not buying it.
2698297	2700259	It'll just be the same damn fucking engine.
2700339	2710646	Okay, they can go back and tweak it and make it a little bit better, but please, you know, take a page from Capcom, listen to the goddamn feedback from the people that play your games.
2710886	2716771	James Patrick, Red Steel is better than Killzone, and Mace Griffin on PS2, Red Steel isn't that bad.
2718354	2721156	Okay, Killzone on PlayStation 2, that game was fucking old.
2721516	2726100	And granted, the game itself, I mean, is probably pretty good, it's just the controls that suck.
2726320	2731043	And that's what's really bad about it, is the fact that they really fucked up what could have been a good game.
2731764	2733505	Blackboy says, I kind of liked Red Steel.
2734225	2736347	Good, to each their own, but you know what?
2736787	2741771	There's people out there that are actually going to put down money for Splinter Cell Double Agent on the Wii, and I go, why?
2742011	2742991	But, whatever.
2743032	2743452	Whatever.
2744403	2753247	Go ahead, buy GT and Monster 4x4 for the Wii, because those aren't like old GameCube games or something that they just re-released and tacked on controls to.
2753907	2754747	Oh wait, no they are.
2755828	2759329	Alright, I see Jamie twiddling her thumbs over there, she's sick of Loki bitching.
2759429	2760910	She's ready to get to a new story, aren't you?
2761550	2762270	Aren't you, DarkSakura?
2762290	2765391	Alright, well I have a story about Luminous.
2765451	2766352	You like Luminous, right?
2766412	2767252	I like Luminous!
2767792	2768913	Do you like Luminous on the Xbox 360?
2772256	2773177	I'll take that as a no.
2773218	2774259	I haven't played it.
2774459	2774820	Oh, okay.
2776763	2781330	I was like, I don't know how to answer that because I like Luminous and I like the Xbox 360.
2781390	2781891	Here's the thing.
2782411	2786097	Luminous on the 360 is great except for the Xbox 360 controller.
2787109	2794053	and the fact that, you know, you have all these microtransactions and the fact that if you own the PSP version, there's really not a lot of reason to get Luminous on 360.
2795153	2798975	But if you don't have a PSP, you really should have Luminous on the 360.
2799175	2802417	So, but anyway, there's a reason why I bring this up.
2803017	2809920	Xbox and Microsoft apparently thinks more people should be playing Luminous and they are going to have an official competition.
2809980	2814943	It's the Xbox Live Arcade Challenge and it's going to feature Luminous Live starting...
2815243	2818525	Today, the 17th, and it's going to run through the 23rd of December.
2818605	2833652	So if you think you're good at Luminous, specifically the 60-second attack mode, if you can make a ton of bricks in the 60-second attack mode, I mean, it doesn't take long to try, you should enter this contest, and you might win a 42-inch Hitachi Plasma HD TV.
2833992	2841456	Four runners-up will get an HD DVD bundle, a wireless headset, and the 360 wireless racing wheel.
2841476	2844457	100 ranking players, like the next 100 ranking players,
2844738	2852102	will get 500 Microsoft Points tokens to be redeemed for Xbox Live imagery, which I'm assuming means you can't buy games with it.
2853002	2860606	Probably because it would... I'm assuming the reason why is because it would screw up the reimbursement to the creators of the game, which is why they force you to get imagery with it.
2860946	2867569	But if you really wanted a Halo theme that you have to pay for or something, I guess you could place in the top 100 and get it.
2867989	2873152	By the way, they're also doing Small Arms, and that is running from the 24th of this month through the 30th.
2874099	2875519	So you only have to be in the top 105.
2876800	2877540	So get to work.
2878100	2881501	I'd like to see some OL Army members win some Xbox Live imagery.
2883362	2884042	Wouldn't that be fun?
2884282	2887203	Do I have to buy into this competition for Loomis?
2887243	2889584	Well, you have to buy the game, but I believe that's it.
2889604	2890884	Everything else you have to purchase.
2893005	2893825	No, I don't believe so.
2894666	2898627	They should have had a thing that you have to purchase to turn the game off.
2900047	2901768	The tournament skin or whatever?
2903085	2904006	The Power Button skin?
2904066	2904566	Alright, forget it.
2904586	2905586	Let's keep it moving.
2907147	2907567	Anyways.
2909128	2911949	So, um... God, I hate Luminous.
2913209	2914270	Luminous is great.
2914350	2918211	I love, like... I love Luminous for PSP.
2918231	2921752	It was my absolute favorite game that came out last year, you know?
2921812	2923173	And I love Mizuguchi.
2923293	2924434	I think the man's a god.
2925314	2926854	I forgive him for 99 Nights.
2926955	2928555	Even I didn't think that game was that bad.
2928675	2929836	I found the good in 99 Nights, okay?
2931542	2933303	Every Xtend Extra I ran out and bought.
2933343	2938105	But anyway, Luminous 2, if you didn't have Luminous 1, Luminous 2 is really good.
2938345	2940966	And even if you're a fan of Luminous, Luminous 2 is really, really good.
2941246	2941787	It really is.
2942447	2943587	You're just hating on puzzle games.
2943607	2944628	You're hating on everything today.
2945928	2952031	So, if you're looking for some better games to be coming out, the XNA is definitely one way that might happen.
2952051	2960375	Especially since now it's allowing a lot of independent developers to create their own Xbox Live Arcade games, or possibly Xbox Live Arcade games.
2961091	2966255	But they're saying that basically the XNA is going to become the YouTube for games.
2966775	2974621	So I have to ask, are these going to be games that are reruns of shows that were on the night before that I can catch in case I missed, you know?
2975061	2978984	Or is it going to be like, you know, knockoffs of everything or, you know...
2980258	2981900	Game A with music from Game B
2998376	3000718	To be able to share your own games with the whole community.
3018195	3018455	XNA, XNA, XNA
3038584	3043326	I think I downloaded it and I'm like, I don't know how the fuck to use this, and I deleted it.
3043426	3052730	So yeah, I don't have to pay $99 a year for YouTube, so I don't understand how this... You only have to pay $99, I believe, to play the games on your Xbox 360.
3053450	3057972	You can distribute them for free, like using Windows.
3058072	3059272	You can play the games on Windows.
3059352	3064354	And apparently, I guess, the wired controllers and the wireless ones, once that wireless adapter comes out,
3065922	3068484	All the XNA games will support those controllers.
3069845	3079293	You don't necessarily need to buy into this yet, but I would like to see an open place where you can play some games or download some free arcade games.
3079573	3080114	That'd be nice.
3081495	3086799	Funnydale says, XNA will never be YouTube because 90% of people are too stupid to use XNA.
3087800	3090482	Could you imagine if they banned stupid people from YouTube?
3091303	3093385	There'd be no YouTube.
3093405	3093605	So nice.
3095626	3096367	Thank you for watching!
3108843	3109483	You better patent that.
3109503	3110944	Britney Spears, I really want you to put on panties.
3110964	3111845	Why won't you listen to me, girl?
3111965	3113906	Britney Spears is actually listening to you on YouTube.
3113926	3115527	She's searching for your blog.
3140419	3142560	Now there's a game I'd like to see in XNA.
3143280	3145101	Help Britney Spears dress herself.
3147122	3147503	Why not?
3147543	3149263	They made Britney Spears dance beat.
3150204	3150904	Britney's dance beat?
3151184	3152165	I saw the greatest thing.
3152225	3154006	I thought about getting this for you for Christmas.
3154386	3158608	They had it at some stupid jewelry store or whatever.
3158688	3163691	It was a DDR-like game, but it was to teach you how to cheerlead.
3163711	3166532	Oh my god, I saw commercials for that.
3166572	3168233	That was so fucking hilarious.
3168832	3172054	It's like, okay girls, go!
3172214	3174235	Isn't that just like Para Para Paradise?
3174696	3175116	Not really.
3175316	3175796	Oh, okay.
3177517	3181120	It's like an exercise video, except you're on a DDR-type mat.
3182300	3182841	So it was funny.
3184201	3184602	Alright.
3186183	3188324	Well, hey, how about something different?
3188844	3189324	Sure, like what?
3189405	3190805	Other than cheerleaders.
3191246	3192206	How about release dates?
3192867	3194968	Okay, now let's talk about some games we'll actually get to play.
3196090	3196911	Chris laughed.
3197151	3197671	Anyway.
3226082	3228384	Coming out... Oh, stop that.
3229384	3229604	Okay.
3230425	3230665	Hey!
3230885	3235088	And it's kind of funny because this game's coming out on the winter solstice.
3235128	3239071	The 21st, we have Sam & Max Episode 2, Situation Comedy for the PC.
3239851	3242273	The 22nd, Marvel Ultimate Alliance on Wii.
3242833	3244674	Open Season, Star Trek Legacy.
3246135	3249197	Wii Sports on Christmas Day, which is bizarre.
3250238	3250318	Um...
3251545	3253826	and then a few other to be announced ones.
3253846	3259287	The Silent Hill Origins, Point Blank, Limbo of the Lost, which just sounds very interesting.
3260808	3261248	That's it.
3261328	3262368	Really not too much else.
3263309	3263549	Wow.
3264149	3266529	Well, you know, what's to be expected right before Christmas?
3267190	3269670	Well, actually, if you're in Japan, you have a lot of other options.
3270491	3272011	Xbox 360 over in Japan.
3272051	3273211	Again, these Japanese release dates.
3273612	3275692	Lost Planet coming out on December 21st.
3275772	3278373	Madden NFL 07 if you're a football fan in Japan.
3279319	3286126	Need for Speed Carbon and Sonic the Hedgehog all making their way to the Xbox 360 on December 21st.
3286767	3294956	PlayStation 3 is going to see Armored Core 4 on the 21st, also their version of Need for Speed Carbon and their version of Sonic the Hedgehog all making their way to the PlayStation 3.
3295805	3297485	Over on Nintendo Wii, guess what?
3297585	3299866	Need for Speed Carbon, because that game comes out everywhere.
3300186	3304787	Also, you're getting Monster 4x4 World Circuit from Ubisoft.
3304827	3305548	Hooray!
3306268	3307468	On the PlayStation 2.
3308228	3310449	School Love, which is our game name of the week.
3310549	3312849	School Love comes out.
3313690	3315130	Also, a limited edition.
3315825	3330097	This game is made by Views, and again, it's a PlayStation 2 game, and of course, what Japanese release would be incomplete without the anime-looking cute girls in uniforms on the cover with the name School Love underneath that?
3330117	3330718	Dating Sim, right?
3332099	3336463	I think that's what it looks like, because I'm looking at the little screenshot pictures here.
3336603	3337203	That's a Dating Sim?
3337224	3338385	Yeah, it looks like a Dating Sim.
3338805	3343529	So if you have ever wanted to date school girls in the comfort of your own home,
3344502	3346863	I have yaoi dating sims, those are always fun.
3370287	3371108	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3390580	3391380	Not the porn one.
3391641	3394642	I gotta get to the rest of the releases, because there's some big stuff in here.
3394722	3401946	Speaking of Evangelion, there's Secret of Evangelion coming out from Jinx, also in Japan on PlayStation 2.
3402406	3405848	And, uh, Squeenix fanboys, prepare thyselves.
3406208	3407489	Here comes your fanboy boner.
3408109	3412612	Seiken Detsetsu 4, also known as Dawn of Mana, December 21st, this week.
3413512	3415833	I need new pants.
3417294	3418074	There goes her boner.
3418635	3418695	Uh...
3419565	3426108	On the Nintendo DS, you have a cute pouch, DS, oh, these are like just little pouches, I think.
3426909	3428889	Angel Pocket with DS Diary.
3429790	3433672	Lots of little things coming out there for the DS, accessory-wise.
3434472	3436933	And the sweet pouch, also coming from Konami.
3437233	3442416	But get this, if you cannot get enough hamster action on your Nintendo DS...
3444139	3450201	Hamster to Kurasawa is coming out on the Nintendo DS in Japan this week.
3450241	3452102	And look at the cute cover!
3452282	3452982	Oh god!
3456163	3457064	This is great radio.
3457084	3459825	This is great radio.
3461125	3465727	Let me post that link in our chatroom there if you folks would like to check out the Love Hamsters there on the DS.
3466385	3475691	They can't... What... Seriously, can one of our, like, Japanese listeners, because I know we have some, can one of them email me and please tell me what is up with hamsters?
3476152	3479174	You know, I think I want to buy... Apparently they're good for the ass.
3479434	3485318	I think I... I think... Sadly, that trend was probably started in America.
3485678	3493704	I think I'm going to actually buy one of those DS hamster games, because they have the hamsters ones over... Unfortunately, it's by Ubisoft, but...
3494680	3496001	So much for your boycott.
3496241	3501803	They have Hamster's Life or whatever, and you get to create your own little house and stuff.
3502063	3504184	So I might buy that just to try it out.
3504945	3506646	I do have a rebuttal for the chatroom, by the way.
3506686	3507066	What's that?
3507406	3509987	Don't you know Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game?
3511608	3511968	Alright.
3513020	3514821	It was a quote in Puzzle Fighter
3541841	3543642	Oh no, I'm sorry, those dates are in February, never mind.
3544602	3545243	You got a ways out.
3545763	3548184	But you will get new games on the 22nd of February.
3548644	3550125	And that's all I care to share with you at this time.
3551306	3557148	If you're looking for games in the United States this week, you're not going to have much to choose from, actually.
3557789	3561450	Coming out on the PSP, we have Metal Slug Anthology.
3563031	3564632	Also, Bubble Bobble Evolution.
3566517	3577627	and then on Playstation 2 Brave the Search for Spirit Dancer which is delayed since like August and on PC Paws and Claws Pet School where you get to
3578590	3585594	You get to cure animals by petting them and... I swear to God, you... Oh my God, cute!
3585994	3587155	That's all you do!
3587175	3589296	Oh, you're dying from cancer!
3589476	3591277	My petting will save you!
3591638	3593879	That's basically this game, I swear to God.
3594879	3603404	And then on the Xbox 360, you're getting Rappala trophies, because if you really want a really crappy-ass fishing game, there you go.
3603564	3607727	And then Mad Catz, the Xbox Live Arcade Retro Stick, which...
3608780	3613384	People say it's awesome for Xbox Live Arcade games, but I think it looks like a giant piece of crap.
3613444	3616186	So, if you want to buy it, great.
3616686	3619448	Shouldn't you try it before you pass judgment on it here on this program?
3620389	3621890	It just looks awful, dude.
3622010	3625593	I'm not buying an arcade stick for just a couple Xbox Live Arcade games.
3625934	3628676	I will build my own stick before I go and buy one.
3629456	3630317	But, that's it.
3633019	3633740	Yeah.
3634941	3637903	Well, I have some game news.
3638433	3639754	Final Fantasy Tactics, Shishi Sensou
3668690	3674752	Meaning that they're also saying it's going to be cel-shaded, have new jobs, and is a sequel to the PSX one.
3675013	3680274	Oh, okay, because I heard it was like a direct port of the PlayStation one, but it sounds like they're enhancing it, like a lot of these, you know.
3680334	3680855	It's a sequel.
3681375	3682095	Huh, interesting.
3683176	3684116	I'll be cool.
3685076	3694460	I mean, if it's the same one with more stuff, then that will still be fun, because Final Fantasy Tactics, even though I'm not a fan of tactics games, I think it's cool.
3694480	3695540	I like watching people play them.
3696243	3700544	Final Fantasy Tactics A2, Fuketsu no Gurimore I like Final Fantasy Tactics
3724235	3725375	All I want for Xmas is a PSP.com
3752779	3753861	All I Want For Xmas Is A PSP.com
3769824	3770565	All I want is a PSP!
3789195	3789696	Xmas of PSP.com
3801949	3804391	Zipatoni is one of Sony's marketing firms.
3805011	3810815	So people, once this caught wind on the game blogs, people started spamming the crap out of this site.
3810835	3813036	You know, liars, we found you out.
3813096	3814177	Hi, Zipatoni.
3815438	3818260	And just all this nasty, nasty shit written in these comments.
3818620	3823343	And if you missed all this action play out, sorry, the site's gone because it's just a big white page now.
3823383	3828046	But what happened later in the week, Sony fessed up at something to the effect of,
3828632	3834795	Blah, blah, blah, you caught us, blah, blah, blah, I guess we were too funky fresh for you, blah, blah, blah, etc.
3835115	3837436	Continuing to make themselves look stupid.
3837656	3849942	Because the problem I think most people had with All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com is not necessarily the fact that they were being lied to, because there's been previous viral marketing campaigns that were kind of, you know, fun, like the I Love Bees and stuff like that.
3850262	3857666	But the problem with All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com is they made your typical gamer look like a dumbass.
3858849	3866514	I mean, just a complete and utter... Seriously, when I watch these videos, I felt my intelligence be insulted.
3866554	3868395	Like, this is supposed to win me over?
3868675	3871177	This is really what marketing people think gamers are?
3871497	3879322	And for Sony to come out and say, I guess we were too funky fresh for you, that's like when grandma says something about... Who says funky fresh?
3879902	3883845	Oh, wow, that was really the bee's knees trying to be cool like you.
3884185	3887127	I'm going like, you people really don't get it.
3888144	3917166	and the thing too about it is they're all using they had a bunch of fake comments on there too by people saying oh this is the best site ever and then like using number two for every time they said two and just trying to fake that leet speak or whatever on their website and why the fuck do they create a website other than to get buzz and stuff about the PSP but it's just
3917791	3927016	to create a fake website, you know, with a bunch of people saying, oh, the PSP's awesome and stuff like that, it's just, it's really dirty, I don't know, it just seems like...
3927797	3932040	I don't see Nintendo making fake websites going, oh, the Wii is awesome and stuff.
3932380	3936082	You don't need to make up that publicity.
3936103	3941586	It's just the PSP and the PlayStation 3 have been having a big problem with their marketing campaigns.
3941706	3944408	All right, I got some comments from the chat room I have to read here.
3945328	3947390	Crispy says, at least they fessed up.
3947930	3948370	Well, you know what?
3948450	3950150	I kind of feel like they had to fess up.
3950211	3950951	I mean, seriously?
3951271	3961413	Sony was caught with not only their pants down, but their boxers down too, so the world could see what an incredibly tiny, tiny penis Sony had when it came to the PSP.
3961753	3974956	Because seriously, that's kind of what it boils down to right now, is that Sony's probably a little pissed that people are all hyped about Wii and DS and da-da-da-da-da, and that there wasn't a legitimate blog out there for PSP rabid fandom.
3975276	3976376	So they created this.
3976876	3984103	And let's see, Funnydale in our chatroom says, I hate to break the news to you guys, but every video game commercial makes gamers look like a bunch of losers.
3985944	3987085	What, Chris, you say that's not true?
3987426	3988106	That's not true.
3988166	3988727	I don't get that.
3988847	3990048	I don't get that when I see those.
3990789	3991349	It depends.
3991509	3993992	Again, it depends on what commercial I'm looking at.
3994252	3999817	Like, I kind of like the Wii commercials, but then again, the Wii appeals to those that are not gamers, so...
4000800	4002421	I think... Yeah, I don't know.
4002641	4005783	Well, let's look at... I can see where he's getting that comment from, though.
4005843	4009486	It has taken the society a long time to get gamers, you know what I mean?
4009566	4017591	I think it really... Like, the PlayStation commercials, like, for both the PSP and the PlayStation 3, I never really got them.
4017691	4023315	Like, and I always knew that they had a problem with their marketing firms, because look at the way they're advertising.
4023335	4030179	Like, the PSP, they have two stick figures, or not stick figures, but, like, you know, sketch drawings of, like, dust bunnies or whatever...
4030936	4035478	Like talking about random shit, you know, and they're all PSP.
4035558	4036898	It's like, you know, nuts.
4037239	4039459	It's like a nut you can play outside or something like that.
4039479	4040760	It doesn't make any sense.
4041300	4043141	Nor do the PlayStation 3 commercials.
4043241	4045762	They're in the room with the, you know, PlayStation 3, you know.
4046383	4047144	Thank you for watching!
4072887	4078430	Flaming Bozo in our chatroom says, No, the commercials for gaming colleges make us look stupid.
4078570	4080190	Oh, yeah, those are awful.
4080250	4081711	Okay, thank you for citing a commercial.
4081751	4084412	You're right, that one does make gamers look pretty stupid.
4084712	4092076	But I think people need to get the concept of, and this is one of those things I feel like, you know, at least in the Wii marketing, and again, I'm not talking about the systems, I'm talking about the marketing.
4092316	4095697	In the Wii marketing, it's kind of got that gamers are everybody.
4096078	4097198	Who enjoys movies?
4097778	4098379	Everybody.
4098659	4099859	Who listens to music?
4100320	4100980	Everybody.
4101000	4101200	Everybody.
4101520	4103882	Shouldn't games be accessible to everybody too?
4104143	4104343	Right?
4104623	4105003	Kind of thing?
4105184	4105464	I don't know.
4105684	4106144	Definitely.
4106164	4107285	One would hope.
4107546	4110008	Anyway, real quick question, then we'll get to another story here.
4110028	4114312	But I want to go around the room and ask, yes or no, and any other thing you want to say.
4114832	4121158	Sony should fire any company related to their marketing right now and start with new companies around the board.
4121398	4125302	In other words, Sony should just axe everything to do with their marketing right now and start anew in 2007.
4125342	4125562	Yes or no?
4127946	4141637	I think it would be a good idea to not only get new marketers, I mean, get some people that actually know how to market this stuff, like the people behind Burger King, or even like Geico, just like people that come up with really creative marketing campaigns.
4142258	4143419	Great, that's great.
4143519	4145200	Get some of those people to help you out.
4145581	4151926	Also, get your higher-ups to shut the fuck up, because they keep ruining any good marketing that you do for yourselves.
4152366	4153827	So that's what they need to do.
4154067	4155949	And also, I think companies have a really...
4156741	4159022	Crazy idea what viral marketing is.
4160622	4161362	Jamie, yes or no?
4161402	4162903	Sony needs to fire all their marketers.
4163903	4173526	To take this from a business point of view, that would actually be pretty damn illogical to expect them to because they have contracts set up with these.
4174726	4186530	What they need to do is have more express control, you know, better, I'd say better QA with what goes on, with what's marketed, more involvement with this, you know,
4187296	4189018	Let's look at this realistically.
4189038	4195163	Because honestly, anything that their marketing firms come up with, doesn't Sony have to approve?
4197005	4200608	So somebody at Sony approved these.
4201149	4204552	They need to find whoever was in charge of approving it and fire them.
4206133	4208956	Or a structural reorganization.
4209036	4210177	Structural reorganization, yes.
4210677	4211158	Either that or...
4212106	4216648	We don't like to talk about people getting killed or fired or anything, but structural reorganization is a need.
4216808	4217428	Or hire me.
4219189	4220169	Would you save Sony?
4220449	4221169	I am brilliant.
4221369	4222490	I would save Sony's ass.
4222530	4223010	Oh, God.
4223070	4224030	No, I'm sorry.
4224070	4225371	I love you, Jamie, but damn.
4225451	4228272	I mean, it would be like PlayStation 3 starts fires.
4228392	4229312	Fire, fire, fire.
4229472	4230273	No, no, no, no, no.
4230593	4233314	It would be PlayStation 3 presented by Sega.
4234014	4240076	Okay, here's what they really need to do, and they really need to just focus on
4240931	4243293	What makes the system good?
4243573	4245795	It plays games.
4245855	4247557	It's great for gaming and stuff.
4247917	4252181	Maybe show off the 6-axis controller and how it's used in games and stuff like that.
4252721	4259307	Maybe just focus on what the system offers instead of just these really cryptic fucking commercials.
4260067	4267394	Also, the PSP, they need to fucking get some good marketing behind this thing because right now, they're hoping Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops is good.
4267694	4268995	It was like a system seller, but
4270060	4272821	I don't think anyone really knows what's a good game on the PSP.
4273021	4275422	Well, maybe word needs to get out there that maybe it's Metal Gear.
4275502	4277423	And we're trying not to be like a Sony hate fest.
4277743	4279163	I don't know, maybe some of you guys are.
4279283	4283705	I don't want to see this be like a total Sony hate fest because there are, you know, like I said, I love Luminous 2 every cent extra.
4283925	4285786	There are good things I like about the PSP.
4286146	4288487	It's just that, boy, your marketing sucks right now.
4289947	4292348	Some of their commercials and print materials have been decent.
4292888	4298071	And so if I were to answer this question, I would say whoever was behind this whole thing, definitely structural reorganization.
4299092	4302294	But when it comes to, you know, some of their marketing hasn't been bad.
4302314	4305996	What happened to the really cool marketing that they had at E3, like the Play Beyond stuff?
4306517	4307497	That stuff was cool.
4307517	4308418	They should have stuck with that.
4308478	4313681	But see, my marketing scheme for the PlayStation 3 would start off with fire in the commercial.
4314642	4314942	Okay.
4315962	4316283	You know what?
4316863	4320405	Sony needs to hire Jamie to be their Major Nelson.
4320465	4321486	It's Sergeant Sakura.
4321506	4321626	Right.
4323137	4324318	It would start off with fire.
4325938	4328360	And then there would be some more explosions in the background.
4328880	4335603	And then... This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, your PlayStation 3 will be on fire!
4336544	4337404	No, no, no, no, no.
4337924	4341886	There'd be like a fence in the background, like a chain link fence.
4342847	4346289	And there'd be like all these really awesome people walking around with PlayStation 3s.
4347401	4350424	And then the announcer going, buy a PlayStation 3, dammit!
4350865	4358493	Alright, I gotta let Chris comment on this being the, you know, one who maybe isn't as into consoles as the rest of us.
4359173	4360975	Sony needs to fire them all, yes or no?
4362096	4368423	Uh, well, realistically, we all know they're not going to, because like somebody said, I think it was Jamie, they got contracts, um...
4369818	4391689	I don't think they should get fired but someone definitely needs to go I nominate Jamie for this someone needs to go in there and like bitch slap them because I think what they're doing gladly yeah I know I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm reading chat room and these comments are too good to pass up hold on let Chris finish your thought yeah the chat room upped me it's okay no I'm sorry finish your thought go go go quick okay
4392239	4397501	Fireboma has an idea for a campaign, and that is the PlayStation 3 campaign will go something like this.
4398181	4399802	Only faggots buy a Wii.
4402543	4405204	And look, look, I am gay, so I can laugh at that.
4405244	4406025	That is kind of funny.
4407425	4410126	If you buy a Wii, that means you like it in the ass.
4411187	4413187	Xbox, this will be the other commercial.
4413628	4416269	Xbox 360 owners are fat and retarded.
4416389	4417889	You aren't fat and retarded, are you?
4422421	4422841	There it is.
4423401	4424942	Sergeant Firebomba, everybody.
4425522	4429604	If you have the Wii 60, does it mean that you're a big fat dyke?
4429965	4433206	You know, honestly, even though... That means you like fried chicken.
4433766	4438088	And even though that is so offensive, I would still think that's a better advertisement.
4438168	4439089	I would laugh at that.
4439109	4439609	I know.
4439709	4441250	I would at least laugh at that.
4441550	4448513	Like, if I saw a commercial come on TV, like, you think I should be offended, you know, being gay and all, but I would probably laugh.
4448553	4451995	Like, I'd be all, that's better than the all-I-want breakfast is a PSP thing.
4453368	4455189	I'm laughing so hard, that's great.
4455689	4457850	I'm just thinking of the hate mail that's going to come in.
4457890	4459290	New ad scheme, new ad scheme.
4459390	4461371	You guys should not be using those words on the air.
4462411	4463552	So what?
4463612	4465472	We have a mature rating.
4465592	4466633	I know, whatever, whatever.
4466913	4468633	No, the ad scheme would be this.
4469754	4471254	You just have a black screen, yeah?
4472055	4473475	And a PlayStation 3 shows up.
4473915	4475516	It's like, you want one.
4476156	4476956	We're Sony.
4477416	4478497	Kiss our ass.
4478737	4480257	No, no, no, I got one here.
4480318	4481558	I got one here, I got one here, I'm sorry.
4481994	4484215	Buy a PlayStation 3 or we will kill you!
4484635	4485516	Okay, hold on.
4485556	4486416	We're getting too crazy here.
4486436	4487537	Hold on.
4487617	4488937	I'm going to put a call out to the listeners.
4489538	4491099	We have a voicemail system, right?
4492379	4493500	This is a homework assignment.
4493580	4496241	And we'll even turn this into a giveaway.
4496801	4497262	This is it.
4498122	4499843	We want you to leave a voicemail.
4499923	4500363	Not now.
4500403	4502564	If you're listening live to us on Sunday, please don't call now.
4502624	4505346	But call after when the podcast feed hits.
4505386	4505646	Call.
4506066	4509128	Leave your best 30-second Sony commercial.
4509588	4509888	Okay?
4510723	4517890	The winner, the one that persuades us to buy a Sony product the most, we will send something from our prize pool somewhere.
4518010	4519632	So we'll dig something up.
4519692	4520012	I don't know.
4520413	4522034	I want a paper for Rob's bathroom.
4522215	4522495	All right.
4522575	4523055	So anyway.
4523636	4523916	All right.
4525197	4526138	So get to it.
4526579	4533426	Leave your 30-second voicemails, and we'll play our favorites when we come back live here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4534447	4534727	All right.
4535595	4537998	Feral Trade Commission on Monday said that companies would be required to
4555219	4558281	to disclose ties of word-of-mouth marketing campaigns.
4558341	4567048	These fake grassroots efforts, dubbed astro-surfing by critics, hire people to endorse products as themselves rather than respective companies.
4569390	4580458	So, actually it's pretty cool that they're doing this, and I do think it's something, because I always see when they're advertising different games and stuff, all these viral marketing campaigns, and
4581548	4583269	I don't think people know what viral marketing is.
4583289	4591214	You're not supposed to know that you're being marketed to not by saying, look, I'm a site called I love such and such game or something.
4591734	4593615	I love Barbie Horse Adventures.
4594076	4596537	And having a bunch of people saying, yeah, that game rocks.
4596677	4597958	That's not viral marketing.
4597998	4601020	That is basically lying to people.
4601060	4605102	A viral marketing campaign is saying, Barbie's saying, oh, come try out my new horse game.
4605362	4606863	Getting an email like that or something.
4607283	4608364	That is a little bit different.
4609569	4613030	I want to get emails from Barbie.
4613250	4615270	Why don't I sign up for that?
4615570	4618131	Be a dirty whore.
4618731	4620071	Alternate Reality Gaming.
4620171	4625492	That's another good marketing campaign because it gets people involved and it's kind of some mystery to it.
4626932	4628432	I think it's a really good way to do that.
4628512	4635634	Isle of Bees, the whole Xbox 360 campaigns that they did, the Hex 168 or whatever it was.
4638075	4643999	That's good marketing, but I guess when you have retarded marketing companies working for you, that's all they can come up with.
4644579	4646701	By the way, I forgot to give you the voicemail number.
4646761	4650363	Speaking of a good lapse of judgment, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4650403	4651404	That's toll-free in the U.S.
4651464	4651964	and Canada.
4652345	4652985	Sorry, U.K.
4653025	4654186	listeners, you'd have to pay.
4654306	4658529	But you could do it the free way if you use Skype, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4658849	4660871	You can just give us a call there, download the program.
4660891	4662532	More information on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4662772	4663753	Click on Interact With Us.
4664253	4665274	Hey, I thought of another idea.
4665654	4665954	What's that?
4666835	4667355	Ad campaigns.
4668291	4668912	Going back to that.
4669273	4669593	Okay.
4670154	4672017	A giant crab comes out clutching a PlayStation 3.
4673940	4674961	I would laugh at that.
4674981	4675963	That would be awesome.
4676323	4678867	And the slogan is, buy a PS3, get crabs.
4681297	4682178	You're welcome, chat room.
4682198	4682378	All right.
4707862	4708903	So hey, my turn, right?
4709283	4710303	Sure, yes, now you can go.
4710824	4711944	Okay.
4712464	4724510	Well, speaking of the PlayStation 3, you know, by our crabs, they put out the 1.31 update, which adds support for Final Fantasy XI for all you weird addicts.
4726531	4736016	The update on the US page does not state what is involved in it, but however, the Japanese site does, and based on a rudimentary translation,
4736776	4747601	It's the installation of the hard disk PlayStation 2, so basically the hard drive attachment is going to be compatible.
4748221	4753924	So that means you get Nobunaga's Ambition Online and Final Fantasy XI.
4754844	4760027	Now, they're saying that it's not quite working on the Japanese site for the PlayStation 2 system data.
4760743	4762864	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4777885	4782306	My question would be, though, would you really want to play this game on the PlayStation 3?
4782686	4786988	Because I don't know if you guys have seen this video on Dig this week.
4787228	4788748	It hit Dig and it was all over the internet.
4788768	4796210	But some guy actually made a side-by-side comparison of playing Final Fantasy X on the PlayStation 2 and on the PlayStation 3.
4796991	4801112	And honestly, it looks like absolute horseshit on the PlayStation 3.
4801792	4803473	And they show you what the PS3 one looks like.
4803493	4804493	I'm playing it in the studio here.
4804813	4808076	You can see the PS3 is on one side of the screen, the PS2 is on the other side of the screen.
4808356	4811359	Let me go to a section here that has, like, a face, and you can really tell the difference.
4811379	4813801	You can see how the PS3 one is, like, kind of like... It's faded.
4814061	4815202	Yeah, it's, like, faded out.
4815222	4816243	It looks a little washed.
4816523	4820166	And you can see, especially when they get into, like, the shots... See, look at the shots of Yuna's face here.
4820526	4823368	You can see, like, all these jaggedies there.
4823408	4824609	You can see, like, all this stuff.
4825170	4833657	The one thing in defense of the PlayStation 3 side is the colors seem a bit more normalized, not over-contrasted.
4834255	4834435	Right.
4834915	4841320	So, anyway, what basically is going on here is that, you know, they're saying this could be really fixed with just a simple firmware update.
4841700	4847404	Honestly, that's all they really had to do to get rid of the jaggeds and the artifacts that are there, but nothing yet.
4847564	4850345	I guess it was one of those things that was overlooked to get the system out on time.
4850686	4861953	Well, I do think... I'd have to see other games to compare it, honestly, but I do like... Some of the backgrounds looked more washed out, but I think for skin tones...
4863185	4863946	It was clearer.
4864086	4867047	The skin tones were more realistic and accurate.
4867347	4867687	Interesting.
4867707	4869468	You're being more forgiving than most of the internet was.
4869748	4872230	Well, then again, I'm taking it from an artist's point of view.
4873210	4873950	There are more dragonies.
4873970	4875751	Well, let's also, you know, it's YouTube.
4876131	4877292	It's not going to be the best quality.
4877732	4879933	But, look, you got a PS3.
4879953	4882254	You should go home and try for yourself and let us know.
4883655	4884675	You want to borrow my Final Fantasy X?
4884736	4888037	I have Final Fantasy X!
4888097	4889138	I just went checking.
4889478	4890138	God, Rob.
4890238	4891819	No, seriously, though.
4893412	4896314	Actually, that would be good because all I have to do is switch my channels.
4896615	4897555	We actually did that.
4897836	4903219	Dan and I did that a long time ago with our Saturn and the PlayStation for Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
4904120	4904701	Interesting.
4905021	4913787	It turned out that the Saturn version had better sound and the 2D effects were better, but the PlayStation had better 3D, so that was our comparison.
4914067	4914748	I could do that again.
4915268	4915949	Try it with other games.
4916249	4916949	That might be kind of fun.
4917190	4920352	Yeah, I'd have to find duplicates of some of the games, but I could do that.
4921331	4923012	Oops, sorry, I keep playing the video there in the background.
4923052	4924812	I'm trying to get the link there for chat.
4925853	4930114	Because they do this little, like, unnecessary intro to the thing on YouTube, but whatever.
4930454	4932255	Anyway, they're... Oh, damn it!
4933055	4935436	I reposted the hamster thing in chat.
4936596	4937156	Son of a bitch!
4937176	4937797	Hamsters!
4938617	4939537	Go hamster!
4941558	4943518	Damn YouTube.
4943538	4944899	Let me make sure that copied.
4947742	4949283	This is great radio, boys and girls.
4949303	4949963	What can we say?
4950023	4952204	We are taping live, and this is what happens.
4952384	4954364	Once upon a time, there was a Final Fantasy game.
4954404	4954924	Ah, shut up.
4955205	4955525	What?
4956745	4957305	No.
4957365	4958026	Let's try that again.
4958046	4958426	There it is.
4958466	4959926	There's the link the chat room's been begging for.
4961587	4961867	God.
4962227	4962527	All right.
4963728	4964748	Please, let's move on.
4964948	4972170	Hey, ShadowCharlie has also pointed out that you can play as Maria in the Saturn version, but you can also play as Richter, and he's not an easy kill in that one.
4972891	4976632	And Dan just unlocked Richter and Maria mode in Portrait of Ruin.
4977421	4977722	Really?
4978102	4979924	And it's like TurboGrafxMaria.
4980425	4980665	Huh.
4981306	4981866	It's pretty cool.
4981946	4982747	Anyway, I'll just say that.
4982928	4983989	Anyways.
4984189	4990596	So, you know, it's awesome that you get to play Final Fantasy XI on your PlayStation 3.
4990857	4994020	Unfortunately, you can't do that if you're in the UK because it's not out yet.
4994801	4996023	And the speculation is...
4996511	5013855	It might not be out for quite a while, and there might actually be a delay on the March date, and they're saying that it's possibly delayed to May, if not September, according to Computer and Video Games, that website.
5015515	5017996	So, what did Sony have to say about this?
5018556	5022557	Well, actually, Sony's Computer Entertainment Europe
5023038	5035852	David Reeves, he said, well, we're still on schedule with the launch for the PlayStation 3 in March throughout the PAL territories, and all speculation otherwise is without foundation.
5037013	5043921	It should be noted, though, this is the same guy that was saying that they're on track for releasing...
5044816	5050618	Actually, in 2006, spring, he says that they were on track at that time.
5051238	5071466	I'm basically also saying that, I don't know, it's pretty funny though, you know, this guy is basically just giving people the assumption that the thing was coming out in spring of 2006, and then when it passed that date, he's all, oh, by the way, it's not coming out at that time.
5072106	5073947	So, who knows if it's coming out in March.
5074352	5084495	And by the, looking at how many units they're producing, supposedly they're done with the bottleneck with the Blu-ray diodes, but if that's not the case, it might not be coming out.
5085095	5087256	I don't see why the UK won't be getting us on time.
5087296	5089276	I'm sorry, but this guy's word isn't enough for me.
5090077	5090377	Sorry.
5091497	5095118	My thing would be, is they're going to get it in March, but it's definitely not going to be as major.
5095138	5096138	It's going to be like our launch.
5096418	5096638	Yeah.
5096779	5096979	Yeah.
5097539	5101720	Have fun, our friends over the UK who are going to be waiting for this system.
5102773	5103333	DarkSakura.com EarthCam.com
5129797	5135861	No, seriously, you can look at, you know, London, Moscow, Japan, you know, anywhere.
5136441	5141184	It's basically different webcams in different locations across the world.
5141824	5142344	That's kind of cool.
5142605	5144326	I think it's really cool.
5144446	5149669	I'm going to check that out because one thing I've been playing with a lot this week is Google Earth, which is one of my favorite programs ever.
5149689	5153811	It lets you look at satellite photography and zoom in and out anywhere in the world, anywhere.
5154271	5156893	One of the ones I'm looking at right now is in Meppen, Germany.
5157911	5159571	Um, that's of an ice skating rink.
5161272	5162232	I think that's very cool.
5162292	5164292	But it's just basically linked to different international webcams.
5164612	5169973	There's actually a webcam, I hope that they've got it back up, but it was in, uh, New Orleans in the French Quarter.
5169993	5173074	They used to have a cam outside one of the, uh, the bars.
5173574	5174354	You know what's funny?
5174394	5176954	My friend was on that cam once and sent a picture from it.
5176974	5179255	This was years ago, before, you know, all the disaster.
5179655	5180635	Yeah, isn't that funny?
5181495	5186316	And, um, but some of the other places listed here, there's one, um, in, um,
5187051	5190452	Effort, Germany, and a few in Russia.
5191172	5197213	I want to weather for Texas, Peak District, England, Jerusalem, Miami.
5197813	5198474	It's really cool.
5198554	5199474	I think it's very neat.
5199494	5203555	And it's sort of, you know, I don't think there's any in any bathrooms.
5205715	5207175	No locker room webcams, Chris.
5207215	5207515	Sorry.
5208136	5214377	But I think it's a very good idea, another way to bring us, you know, sort of closer together.
5214905	5229877	GS68 in our chatroom says we need an OLR webcam and I'll tell you guys it actually looks like it probably will happen if you're all good boys and girls for Christmas there will be a cam coming back to the show in 2007 I'll be doing the dance of the seven veils in the background
5230854	5233757	Jamie doesn't like to be seen.
5233977	5238381	The problem is the studio we're in now is a lot smaller than any place we were before.
5238401	5240263	There's a lot less people and weird stuff going on.
5240303	5244467	When I say studio, I mean spare bedroom as opposed to the living room at Loki and I's old apartment.
5244507	5245488	Now we're in a spare bedroom.
5245828	5249432	So it's kind of tough for us to situate a webcam here where we can actually see everything.
5249792	5253756	But I'm thinking I know a good place we could put a cam where you could see most of the action.
5254116	5254637	So we'll see.
5254657	5254937	It's beautiful.
5256489	5259651	When you show up, which you need to show up more often, Miss Thing.
5259791	5261051	I'm coming up from the South Bay.
5261091	5262432	I come up as often as I can.
5263012	5263232	All right.
5263252	5263833	We appreciate it.
5264653	5264853	All right.
5264873	5266314	So that's the website of the week, boys and girls.
5266434	5267054	DarkSakura.
5267934	5268295	Give it up.
5268915	5269195	All right.
5270055	5277819	Let's go to some more news, kind of in other types of game news, not about games themselves, but an interesting program going on in Oakland.
5278599	5283021	The SFGate newspaper, or I'm sorry, is this a newspaper or just a website?
5283882	5283962	Or...
5284737	5285341	Alternative Press
5287672	5297057	The SFGate is mentioning that you can go to Fruitvale Elementary School in Oakland where the War Against Improper Toys Drive is going on.
5297998	5311365	What is happening is that they will... What you can do, you can take your replica shotguns, rifles, pistols, whatever, and you can trade them in for books and family-friendly toys.
5311725	5315907	Now, how this plays out is that you can also take your violent video games...
5316494	5318235	What about my Jeff Stryker action figure?
5318295	5321217	I dare you to take it to the school and find out.
5321237	5323239	If you do, please tape it so we can YouTube it.
5323259	5324259	That's all I'm going to say.
5338953	5342776	That address, by the way, 3200 Boston Avenue in Oakland.
5343276	5344056	That's right by 580.
5344537	5348739	Are they going to send all these improper toys to the Island of Misfit Toys by chance?
5348759	5350821	I love that special!
5350841	5352822	They need the Island of Misfit Sex Toys.
5354563	5356144	Not said what they're going to do with it.
5356204	5356525	Sorry.
5356545	5359186	They're going to burn it in effigy.
5360207	5363749	Anyways, this is actually pretty interesting.
5364370	5367892	Speaking of games and stuff, improper toys.
5368740	5397903	Capcom's revamping their multiplayer once we actually ran a story was it last week where they were fixing the small text issues well now they're kind of going off of some more of their user feedback and fixing the multiplayer including some of the lobbies and matchmaking and stuff like that so I'm glad to see a company actually listening to the complaints and maybe suggestions from their users so that in turn you know they create a better product
5398490	5399451	So that's excellent.
5399891	5400572	Cannot wait.
5400952	5404434	It's going to be probably one of the only good 360 games coming out in January.
5405835	5409398	Has anybody ever heard of the GP32X?
5409778	5411540	I'm sorry, the GP2X?
5412180	5412420	Yes.
5413061	5413321	Okay.
5413701	5416163	Well, basically this one is... Okay, no, I haven't.
5418035	5421256	What this is, it's a Linux-based handheld console.
5421996	5424196	It's for movies, games, music.
5425377	5428277	You can develop and run your own software, run MAME on it.
5429698	5431738	It's supposed to be pretty versatile.
5431838	5433999	Well, it's actually getting its first major game.
5434619	5441821	It's getting a game called Payback, which is a crime caper game that was originally on the Game Boy Advance in 2004.
5444678	5467614	It's a top-down action, 11 cities, 50 missions, updated 3D graphics, sound special effects Custom jukebox mode so you can put your own soundtrack on it And it'll actually, again this is for the UK It's going to be £22.99 Think Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 That type of game Huh, interesting
5468534	5470235	You know, I did not remember.
5470295	5473417	I think this handheld was talked about on an earlier show, but I kind of forgot about it.
5473677	5478660	Well, it's interesting they have a Linux handheld because it's funny because they try to put Linux on all the other handhelds.
5478880	5479500	And the toaster.
5479820	5482422	So it's kind of humorous to me to hear about a Linux handheld.
5482802	5483302	I don't know why.
5483522	5484383	I think it's a good idea.
5485083	5486324	I'd actually love to get my hands on one.
5486344	5489586	Yeah, I mean, I would like to see the presence of this increase.
5490006	5493948	Well, if anyone wants to see the website on this game, go to gp2x.co.uk.
5496496	5498678	slash payback.html.
5498858	5502281	It's got a movie file up on there, a bit more about the game.
5502361	5503442	It has some stuff on the system.
5503522	5508086	Yeah, actually, I remember seeing the system at E3 a couple years back.
5509467	5510067	This is pretty cool.
5512009	5514771	Linux, their logo is like a penguin, right?
5515031	5515352	Yes.
5515712	5517854	Okay, I saw that on someone's license plate.
5518534	5520496	It was actually part of the license plate.
5520536	5522538	There are some hardcore nerds out there.
5522578	5525440	We have a neighbor here that has a license plate that says,
5526090	5527631	ZOMG Hack.
5528932	5530133	And I want to know who that is.
5530173	5535798	We live in this huge complex and there's some guy with a license plate there and I'm always like, wow, it's another nerd.
5536619	5538380	Someone had that said noob on it.
5538460	5539061	That was pretty funny.
5539281	5539741	That's cool.
5540722	5542724	Just to give a little bit more about the system, by the way.
5544107	5555512	It has two 200 MHz CPU, 64 MB RAMs, custom graphics hardware, decoding chips, takes SD cards, has 64 MB of NAND memory.
5558293	5561454	Basically, you don't have to re-encode any of your movies that you put on it.
5561494	5563115	It'll play anything directly like on a computer.
5563555	5564375	Price on it is £124.99.
5564635	5567836	And a partridge in a pear tree.
5568437	5568837	I want one.
5569657	5570498	I have everything else.
5570618	5571478	Why don't I have one of these?
5573140	5578162	Dear UK friends, send me one for Christmas.
5578823	5579563	I love you forever.
5580603	5582704	eBay, the gamers shop of choice.
5582764	5583585	Yeah, eBay, seriously.
5583745	5596530	Anyways, so last week we talked a little bit about Interlink's lawsuit with Nintendo over the Wii remote and basically saying that it's infringing on their patents for a Trier-operated electronic device.
5596957	5617917	What's interesting though is we've kind of figured that the whole lawsuit was about the fact that it's like a Wiimote type thing, something motion sensitive, but it's actually just for the stupid trigger on the bottom of the Wiimote, which I don't know about you, but I think there's been remotes with triggers on the bottom of them way before this whole patent thing came to play.
5618017	5622181	So it's going to be interesting to see how that actually plays out in court.
5622833	5625936	Doesn't technically the Xbox 360 controller have a trigger on the bottom of it?
5625956	5627117	It does have a trigger on the bottom of it.
5627137	5628298	Two of them?
5628558	5630400	What about the Nintendo 64 controller?
5630700	5632001	Has a trigger on the bottom of it.
5633743	5637066	The PlayStation 2 has a trigger on the actual controller.
5638167	5641330	I don't think they're going to get very far with this, to be honest.
5641830	5642230	Interesting.
5642290	5642871	They're going to try.
5643952	5646194	Well, we will see, and we'll follow up in a future episode.
5647314	5647954	Thank you for watching!
5661980	5666703	We've got a ton of it coming up next in Orange Lounge Radio Part B, so please stay tuned.
5666723	5667744	We'll see you back here for Part B.
