0	14000	This is your host, DarkSakura, Sky and Mokey!
14000	27000	Tonight, December 17th, 2006, Sony fests up to a fake website, a popular roleplaying series jumps to a new system, and are the Wii modes really being Wii called?
27000	33000	Orange Lounge Radio
33000	37000	Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37000	42000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you for the next three hours, as well as my partners in crime.
47000	52000	Say hello to the one and only happy, happy bunny, DarkSakura.
52000	53000	You're doing it differently, Rob.
53000	55000	What do you mean? Oh, I'm doing the opening differently?
55000	56000	You're doing it differently, Rob.
56000	58000	Am I not allowed to change things once in a while?
58000	59000	Nobody likes anything different.
59000	60000	I'm sorry.
60000	63000	Remember, people only like happy trance.
63000	65000	We fear change.
65000	66000	Get a corn cob up their ass.
66000	67000	Right.
67000	68000	Say hello as well.
68000	70000	You will be like us.
70000	72000	Here comes another podcast review.
72000	74000	DarkSakura is too angsty.
74000	77000	She is so angsty on the show all the time.
77000	80000	But we love her.
80000	82000	We love her. Angstinol. We love her.
82000	83000	I love me too.
83000	86000	And she knows her shit when it comes to video games.
86000	87000	She really does.
87000	88000	Don't be fooled.
88000	89000	Hell yeah.
89000	90000	All right.
90000	92000	Say hello as well to tech master Loki.
92000	95000	There's some weird, like, cord spaghetti going on by your chair there.
95000	98000	That's what happens here in the OLR studio.
98000	101000	So, how's your week been, Loki?
101000	102000	Been pretty good?
102000	103000	It's been okay.
103000	108000	I still haven't played one of the games I bought, but I'm, like, dreading the play because I know it's going to suck.
108000	109000	What's that?
109000	111000	Far Cry Vengeance for the Wii.
111000	112000	Uh-oh.
112000	114000	It got a horrible review.
114000	116000	It has two-player multiplayer, which I didn't know when I bought it.
116000	120000	I mean, you can't have multiplayer. It's just two players in a first-person shooter game.
120000	123000	You know what? The game reviews have been getting a lot of heat lately.
123000	131000	I mean, you have the Zelda Wii Twilight Princess on the GameCube and, you know, things on, what, GameSpot got, like, an 8.8 and 8.9.
131000	133000	People are, like, oh, my God.
133000	134000	They don't know what they're talking about.
134000	137000	But everybody's been giving this thing, like, a 4 out of 10, 3 out of 10.
137000	142000	Well, and then Elibits just recently was reviewed in Electronic Gaming Monthly.
142000	148000	I was reading on Destructoid something about it, and they were pissed because some people over there gave it 4s.
148000	149000	You know?
149000	150000	Whatever.
150000	151000	I know.
151000	155000	But I know just from reading what the, you know, just different specifics about it.
155000	158000	No level editing in there.
158000	163000	And apparently the actual gameplay is kind of lame.
163000	165000	The controls suck on it.
165000	171000	And I don't know, but I haven't played it yet, and I heard the graphics suck even more than the Xbox.
171000	174000	So I might just have to sell it back again.
174000	175000	Oh, well.
175000	176000	All right.
176000	180000	Well, before we get into too much Game Talk, we have to introduce one of our other very special guests.
180000	184000	Say hello to our woman on the street, but she hasn't done any interviews lately.
184000	185000	We're going to have to change that.
185000	186000	Say hello to Chris.
186000	188000	Well, would you like me to interview?
188000	189000	I don't know.
189000	192000	Maybe when we take a trip, because we're planning a trip for January.
192000	194000	I'm going to go on one of your Disneyland excursions.
194000	195000	That's right.
195000	196000	So we can harass people at Disneyland.
196000	197000	That would be fun.
197000	198000	You know what?
198000	199000	We were going to do an interview.
199000	200000	We were at Disneyland last time.
200000	204000	We would go to the one arcade that they have inside both parks, and we were going to go,
204000	208000	you know, say it's like live from the Disneyland arcade.
208000	210000	We have arcade stuff.
210000	212000	Because they don't really have much there, but it's fun.
212000	213000	Yeah.
213000	214000	Yeah.
214000	215000	We were just going to goof off.
215000	218000	They do have a virtual machine where you get inside and it moves around as you're driving
218000	219000	the car.
219000	220000	So that's pretty interesting.
220000	225000	So there was an arcade version of F-Zero which came out on the GameCube not that long ago.
225000	226000	Right.
226000	228000	And it was kind of like that where you got in and it would tilt around.
228000	231000	I loved that game except for the fact there were only six tracks.
231000	232000	So it got old really quick.
232000	233000	My dad was playing that when I was there.
233000	236000	I played the Japanese one at Arcade Infinity.
236000	238000	Yeah, but it still kind of sucked, unfortunately.
238000	239000	I thought it was kind of cool.
239000	241000	Well, you know, the game was great.
241000	242000	You're simple-minded.
242000	246000	No, the game was great, don't get me wrong, but it sucked because it was over before it
246000	247000	started.
247000	248000	Yeah, there is that.
248000	249000	Yeah.
249000	252440	I was selected to say a welcome back to Dark Soccer because she was actually out last week,
252440	254000	but did you girls have fun at Disneyland?
254000	255000	Yes.
255000	256000	And it rained on us.
256000	259000	Oh, no, because I was there Wednesday, sorry.
259000	261000	I was like, wasn't I here earlier in the week?
261000	262000	No, you were here for another show.
262000	265400	You were here for the other show, but this big show you were out last week.
265400	269000	Yeah, I was playing hooky and dancing in the rain.
269000	270000	You're allowed once in a while.
270000	271000	Lots of rain here.
271000	273000	And I was watching Chris fall head first into the lagoon.
273000	274000	You know what?
274000	275000	That was not my fucking fault, okay?
275000	276000	I know.
276000	280080	I was on this little kiddie boat ride, and anyone who's been to Disneyland, it's the
280080	286320	storybook ride where you just pretty much sit in a boat and look at these little miniatures
286320	292160	that are from the stories, and it was raining, and neither of the people who were helping
292160	296120	me into the boat were really paying attention, so I slipped and almost went head first into
296120	297120	the water.
297120	298120	Yeah, I think I caught you.
298120	299120	Oh, no.
299120	300120	No, I know.
300120	301120	Well, you probably did.
301120	302120	Yeah.
302120	303120	It was just really funny.
303120	304120	I caught your arm.
304120	305120	Everybody was laughing at me.
305120	308120	I almost fell on the Hudson River, but we'll have to save that story for another time.
308120	311920	And then someone kept dropping cold water down the back of my sweater on It's a Small
311920	312920	World.
312920	314920	Yeah, well, you're a whore.
314920	316920	Yeah, well, so?
316920	317920	Okay.
317920	322000	Anyway, before we get into pillow fights, we better talk about your gaming week.
322000	324240	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
324240	325240	Cookie Mama!
325240	328960	Lots of Cookie Mama, because Mama will make it better.
328960	330720	Have you been poking Mama's steak?
330720	333960	Yes, I have, and Mama liked it.
333960	337220	For those that don't catch the reference, there's obviously a part of the game where
337220	339720	you have to poke the steak.
339720	341680	Describe what Cookie Mama's all about, for those that haven't heard of it, because we
341680	342680	get new listeners every week.
342680	344200	You use the stylus and you cook, really.
344200	346400	Like you shake the pan.
346400	350440	You blow on the pot to cool it off.
350440	354160	It's like, some of those levels make me think of DDR with food.
354160	357720	Beat Mania with food is like Cookie Mania, but I don't know.
357720	362440	It's a pretty fun little addicting game, because Mama will make it better.
362440	363440	To quote Chris.
363440	364640	Is that it?
364640	365640	Just Cookie Mama?
365640	369080	Just Cookie Mama, and Creature from the Black Lagoon, Pinball.
369080	370080	Ah!
370080	372280	Is that a new one, or is that one you guys had?
372280	373280	I can't keep track anymore.
373280	374880	We got it a few weeks ago.
374880	377480	We're still working, though, on the Rocky and Bull angle.
377480	380880	Wasn't there something about your Guns N' Roses table damn near went backstage to a Guns
380880	381880	N' Roses concert?
381880	384760	Yeah, and then all that fell through, and then they canceled the Sacramento show.
384760	388160	I hate you, Axl Rose!
388160	389160	You bastard!
389160	391680	I hate you for the Metallica thing.
391680	394120	Yeah, ho ho ho to you, too.
394120	397280	Oh, by the way, Happy Holidays to all of our listeners.
397280	400640	Happy Christmas, Kwanzaa, or whatever it is you celebrate, because I think Hanukkah started.
400640	402640	Yeah, we're in the middle of Hanukkah.
402640	403640	Yule is the 21st.
403640	404640	Uh-huh.
404640	405640	We got Yule on the 21st.
405640	406640	Kwanzaa is after Christmas.
406640	407640	I think, what?
407640	408640	Starts the 27th?
408640	409640	God, I hope I'm right.
409640	410640	There's too many holidays to remember.
410640	411640	I'm sorry.
411640	412640	And then Christmas is on the 25th.
412640	415240	And so whatever it is you celebrate, I hope you're having a good one.
415240	420640	And we should probably give an advance Happy Birthday to another person who has been on
420640	422840	the show.
422840	423840	Happy Birthday to Megzi.
423840	424840	Ah.
424840	425840	Right.
425840	426840	Say it.
426840	427840	Happy Birthday.
427840	429840	I'm going to see her on it.
429840	438680	No, we want to hear the Happy Birthday, Miss Megzi.
438680	442400	We also have our chat room, of course, joins us every episode.
442400	444880	And Alex in our chat room says, Happy Festivus.
444880	446280	There you go.
446280	447280	Happy everything.
447280	448280	Happy everything.
448280	449280	I like that.
449280	450280	That's what we should start saying.
450280	451760	I like joyous stuff.
451760	456240	Um, Loki, how was your gaming week?
456240	457240	It was okay.
457240	461560	I played, well, I played Elibits, and Elibits is fun.
461560	465320	And I'm actually kind of far in it, well, not too far, I guess.
465320	467480	I'm on level 9 now.
467480	471880	And I don't know, I tried playing around with the level editor a little bit.
471880	472880	I was kind of surprised, though.
472880	476120	I still haven't seen any edit data from anybody else yet.
476120	480240	You know, and I know a bunch of my friends have to have this game, and yet I see no level
480240	481600	data.
481600	484800	I haven't been playing it enough, sorry.
484800	491960	But I did try making dominoes in that, and the books don't work very well as dominoes.
491960	496240	Although I kind of got a little chain going, but it's just that you get frustrated after
496240	501600	a while and then you just start throwing everything around, and that's kind of fun.
501600	507160	Then I played Cars for the Wii that I bought for Nellie because she wanted another racing
507160	511240	game and she insisted on Cars, and the game sucks balls.
511240	516720	And I knew when I bought it that it was going to be awful, and I just had no idea how bad
516720	517720	it sucked.
517720	519780	But it is awful.
519780	520780	Why is it so awful?
520780	526560	Because it seems like games based on movies usually are a little weaker than usually.
526560	527560	Sometimes you have some good ones.
527560	531680	Well, if you played the 360 demo, I mean, that was okay.
531680	534220	The graphics at least looked pretty good.
534220	541920	Usually the game is full of just random catch freezes from the movie, and then the racing
541920	551000	itself is very slow, and the car steers like a tank, it can't turn for shit, and there's
551000	557020	a bunch of useless ass moves that you can do in the game, and it's just really bad.
557020	562620	It's meant for little kids, that's really what it is, but Nellie wanted an easy game
562620	567440	to play, so there's Cars, and I guess she'll have to play that.
567440	571440	Although she's been ignoring Cars and playing more Excite Truck instead, and she's trying
571440	577080	to get all the S rankings in mirror mode like Christopher has, so that he, you know, because
577080	578080	you all...
578080	579920	Oh my god, my roommate is obsessed with Excite Truck.
579920	584660	I doubt there's anybody in the world that has played this game as much as Xtavor.
584660	590120	He's beaten Excite, Super Excite, Mirror Mode, and now he got all the trophies or something,
590120	594760	so he got some super car thing that flashes when he drives, and he can just go right through
594760	597300	trees and right through other cars.
597300	602400	That's what you get for passing S ranks on all of the Mirror Mode stuff, you get basically
602400	607440	a crazy monster truck that has the POW energy thing throughout the entire race, so you can
607440	610840	slam through cars, trees, etc.
610840	615640	It's the ultimate woman driver, basically.
615640	617720	But there's some other stuff I guess you get in there.
617720	621440	Chris, can you describe this look on your face to the listeners?
621440	622440	No.
622440	627240	Because after Loki said that, I felt this death stare coming from Chris.
627240	631280	And of course, you know, more Grand Theft Auto, more...
631280	635160	I've actually been playing a little bit of Saintsboro, it's still fun to play at lunches
635160	641440	and stuff, but really it's just like there's not a lot coming out until fucking January.
641440	645440	In January there's only one Wii game, WarioWare, and that's it.
645440	649720	But seriously, if you've seen that YouTube clip of the dancing stage in WarioWare, you
649720	652280	know that this game is all you need for January.
652280	653840	I mean, seriously.
653840	661240	That's great, but you know, just other things that you want to play and stuff, even for
661240	663680	the 360 there's really nothing I want to pick up.
663680	666520	Well January's always a dead month, really, for games though, isn't it?
666520	669120	I did play Assault Heroes, and that was fun.
669120	670240	I like that.
670240	674040	Although people are comparing it to Quarry Warriors or something like that, it's not
674040	677800	exactly like that, but I guess you could...
677800	678800	It's pretty fun.
678800	682880	Actually, it kind of reminds me if they did an update to Breakthrough, I don't know if
682880	687320	anyone ever remembers that game, but it's kind of like that, you're in a giant death
687320	692880	car type thing with a gatling gun on it, and you're fighting giant machines and things.
692880	694440	Let's go to the chat room for some comments.
694440	697840	I noticed some new people in chat tonight, so hello to those of you, hopefully we get
697840	699760	some of your comments read.
699760	703560	Jared Joe says Excite Truck got old quite quickly.
703560	709880	So for me, it kind of did, I was like, okay, I'm kind of done with Excite Truck.
709880	713640	I pop it in once in a while for fun, but I think it's more Extraverse Excitement wears
713640	717760	off on me, but I don't know, maybe it's something about the casual gamer, because you notice
717760	721400	the people that are really into this that we know are two people who don't usually play
721400	722400	a lot of games.
722400	723880	But she's not playing it casually anymore, she's playing it for hours.
723880	729480	I know, but there's the casual gamer that plays Bejeweled for hours, so it's just interesting.
729480	731680	I don't know what it is about that game.
731680	735640	It's the gross simplicity of the controls and everything, I think.
735640	740480	The game really could have benefited from more tracks, and maybe more diverse cars or
740480	744440	something else, like different types of cars.
744440	748480	That's what I really think, because it comes down to, you play basically like five different
748480	755040	continents, and each track kind of has portions of other tracks in it, so you'll drive on
755040	756480	the same stretch of track.
756480	760720	Airtoast in our chat room says I didn't like Excite Truck until I put my own MP3s in, it
760720	761720	makes it so much better.
761720	762720	Oh, yeah.
762720	763720	Yeah.
763720	764720	Yeah.
764720	765720	I only need to do that.
765720	767520	I haven't really done that with Excite Truck, because I don't have my own SD card, but I
767520	769400	know Xterfer does, and he does that.
769400	772040	That's what I do with Burnout, which is the racing game I've been playing a lot lately.
772040	776520	I don't like all the emo EA tracks that are in it, so I put my own music, and I'm like
776520	781720	Sin-Poppin' 80s and Madonna, yeah!
781720	785780	You can just imagine what my Burnout games look like, you know, I'm flying through the
785780	789960	air and you know, I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you.
789960	790960	Crap!
790960	795840	That's what it's like to play Burnout with me.
795840	797320	Is that it?
797320	798320	That's it.
798320	799320	Alright, My Gaming Week.
799320	804040	I've also been playing Elibits a little bit, not a lot to really give my full opinions
804040	809280	on the game yet, but I can definitely tell this was a game where the Wii stuff was not
809280	810280	an afterthought.
810280	815360	I mean, even with Zelda, you kind of go, well, the game wasn't originally designed for the
815360	818920	Wii, and you know, definitely Trauma Center wasn't originally designed for the Wii, and
818920	823420	those are some of the strongest launch titles we had, but the cool thing about Elibits is
823420	827400	it was definitely designed with the Wii in mind, and it's kind of cool, you know, I think
827400	831000	the comparisons to Katamari Damacy are fair, I think it has a lot of that same cuteness
831000	836120	factor, I think the only kind of weak point is the music does not have the same infectiousness
836120	839440	as Katamari Damacy does, and to be honest, I think that's really what sets the two games
839440	840440	apart.
840440	843860	But so far, so good gameplay-wise, which is, you know, what's really important about a
843860	848480	game, I'm liking the whole discovering aspect, and the levels take a long time to beat, I
848480	851960	thought it was gonna be like quickie little three-minute levels, these levels take like
851960	856040	fifteen minutes to play, it's pretty crazy, but the Elibits meow, and that's cute, because
856040	860880	I like, I like, you know, the microwave going off in here, meow, meow, meow, it's cute,
860880	865260	and I got a little stuffed Elibit, it's so cute, it's a little blue Elibit, adorable.
865260	868840	As far as the game is, where I have played enough of it, I think to give a fair review,
868840	873840	I did check out Final Fantasy III on the DS, which Loki was kind enough to give me a copy
873840	878200	of, thank you, the one aspect of this game I have not been able to review is the Wi-Fi,
878200	882080	because no one's given me their stinking code, so I'm gonna have to go on the OL Army forums
882080	885800	over at orangeonshredo.com and see if anyone has the Final Fantasy III on the DS, because
885800	889480	I'm really curious, I mean, you can send letters through the moogles and towns, but that's
889480	893960	about it, so it kind of seems like the Wi-Fi thing is, like, pointless, but I hear that's
893960	898080	how you unlock one of the jobs later on, so who knows, but otherwise, Final Fantasy III,
898080	902740	obviously, the missing Final Fantasy game that we never had here in the US, remember,
902740	907240	this is not Final Fantasy III on Super Nintendo, this is the original Final Fantasy III that
907240	913560	was on the NES, well, well liked in Japan, beloved game from the Final Fantasy series,
913560	917800	kind of a precursor to Final Fantasy V of sorts, has a very similar job system, and
917800	921040	if you haven't played Final Fantasy V, I guess the closest thing I could compare it to would
921040	925240	be Tactics, where you kind of select a job and you're leveling within that job with your
925240	929800	different characters, it's kind of neat having it in the 3D form, it kind of looks like Final
929800	935660	Fantasy VII style game on your DS, but in the old school, like, you know, less emo,
935660	940540	no Cloud, no Aerith, you know, more the traditional Final Fantasy, well, okay, maybe a little
940540	948660	bit of emo, but it's kind of cool, it's, it feels like I'm playing, again, an old Super
948660	952600	Nintendo Final Fantasy game, but, like, with the 3D graphics, I'm kind of like, this is
952600	957160	kind of, this is kind of how I like it, you know, I still like my games to feel retro,
957160	960600	even when they have the newer graphics, so that's what I, you know, really dig about
960600	965120	it, otherwise the DS features itself are a little silly, I mean, you can use the touch
965120	968120	controls to move your character around, but it's kind of pointless, maybe that's just
968120	971260	because I, you know, I'm so used to controlling Final Fantasies with a control pad, I kind
971260	976240	of can't do it any other way, and the top screen is, like, sometimes a map, but for
976240	980020	most of the game, it's just off, you don't really use it, I mean, the top screen's just
980020	984160	kind of there, but, I mean, that's okay, I'm kind of okay with the fact they're not really
984160	990200	whoring the DS features of it, they just kind of used what they needed, and then, you know,
990200	994960	kind of just gave us, used the system power to give us the game we desired, so, obviously,
994960	998900	if you're a fan of the Final Fantasy series, you have to have this game, I mean, it's such
998900	1004360	a loved game in the series, it's got a good plot, good music, going lots of the soundtrack
1004360	1008960	course and all that, if you're not so much a fan of role-playing games, I don't think
1008960	1013560	this one's going to be a good starter, because the difficulty level is a little higher, the
1013560	1019960	game does not really tell you what to do so much, you can't easily get hints, it was not
1019960	1023800	brought over here the first time, I believe, because they thought Americans would not get
1023800	1030440	it, so keep in mind the game is a little bit harder than most of the other, you know, Final
1030440	1033920	Fantasy games that came later on where it was very easy to get hints when you didn't
1033920	1038440	know what to do, so, not good for the first-time role-player, but for, you know, someone who's
1038440	1041280	into role-playing games, you definitely have to check this out, I think it's too bad because
1041280	1047800	I think a lot of people forgot about this game amongst the Wii and PS3 releases, and
1047800	1051080	that was my gaming week, Chris, how about you, how was your gaming week?
1051080	1068080	My gaming week, aside from making mama really mad, I actually, and I played Sims 2, obviously,
1068080	1070880	that's all I play.
1070880	1075080	Do you do any of the fanfic stuff in Sims 2, because Jamie was just showing us a picture
1075080	1079160	of the doctor and Rose in bed together in Sims 2, do you do that kind of stuff?
1079160	1084120	You know, I used to play the, just the Sims, and I used to put, like, anything I found
1084120	1087240	on the internet, I'd put it in there, and I don't do that with this game because it
1087240	1093520	really messes it up, and you, I mean, they have it so that if you want to customize it,
1093520	1098680	you can, but it still messes it up to no end, so I just, I don't do that, and I just make
1098680	1104240	random characters that do stuff, I don't know, I just, I like getting the, like, they have
1104240	1107800	little things that your characters can work up to, so I've been trying to do that, but
1107800	1110320	I actually played a PS3.
1110320	1111320	Did you?
1111320	1112320	What'd you think?
1112320	1113840	I didn't like it.
1113840	1114840	What'd you play on it?
1114840	1120280	Well, it's, I don't know, it was in a kiosk, and it was at Target, and it was free, because
1120280	1124040	every time I go in there, it's either off, like, the kiosk is either off, or someone's
1124040	1129480	using it, and it was just sitting there, I'm like, oh, well, I might as well, and I like
1129480	1135020	the graphics, I mean, obviously, Sony's known for their graphics, so, and I was playing
1135020	1138720	it for, like, five minutes, the control, I'm not really into car games, so the controls
1138720	1142720	were kind of wonky at first, and then, as soon as I started getting used to it, it's
1142720	1148560	like, oh, this is not too bad, it froze!
1148560	1152600	That thing apparently has done that, like, once a day.
1152600	1156240	I don't know why, I asked the guy, I'm like, did I do something, did I break it, he's like,
1156240	1158400	nah, it's probably just froze, like, rubber.
1158400	1161920	To be fair to Sony, though, these things, you know, are definitely used more than the
1161920	1165360	regular PlayStation 3s in your house, these things are played to death, you know.
1165360	1167240	I know, but they almost sold me.
1167240	1168240	Really?
1168240	1169240	Yeah!
1169240	1172680	Well, it was, I was sitting there going, it's like, oh, this is not too bad, I mean, but,
1172680	1177200	you know, between Jamie and Meg Z, they're like, Sony's evil!
1177200	1178520	It is the devil!
1178520	1184200	You know, so, and then I finally, you know, actually get to play it, and, you know, it
1184200	1187560	was like, oh, this is not bad, because I like the graphics, but other than that, then it
1187560	1190960	froze on me, and I was pissed off, I also got a little farther in Rule of Rose, that
1190960	1193280	game was weird.
1193280	1196400	But now, when Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out for the PlayStation 3, though, you'll be all over
1196400	1200400	a PS3, it's like, yep, yep, king ring it up, here it is, Kingdom Hearts.
1200400	1201600	I like Kingdom Hearts.
1201600	1204640	That's how I'll be when Fall of Asi 13 comes out, that'll finally be the one that wins
1204640	1205640	me over.
1205640	1208360	Although, you know, and I don't think it made tonight's show roll, so I'm okay in saying
1208360	1212520	this, and if I took somebody's story, I apologize, but I believe there was a late-breaking story,
1212520	1216640	I don't know if it's a rumor status or what's going on, but that Metal Gear Solid 4, which
1216640	1222520	was one of the PS3's big, big exclusives, some insider information coming from, like,
1222520	1226200	a friend who knows a guy at Konami or something, you know, take it with a grain of salt, that
1226200	1229160	it is coming to the 360 a couple months after the PlayStation.
1229160	1230400	Megsy told me that.
1230400	1236520	She was like, she's like, I am so happy that they're gonna bring it, because she's, for
1236520	1242280	Christmas, she's getting a bunch of money, so she's gonna end up going to get an Xbox,
1242280	1245880	and she was like, if they're gonna put, it's like, if they're gonna start putting stuff
1245880	1248080	on the Xbox, I don't need to get a PS3.
1248080	1249080	I am so happy.
1249080	1251320	So, she actually told me about that.
1251320	1255320	If only, like, Kingdom Hearts 3 could come out on 360, then great, then it's it.
1255320	1257320	Yeah, then I have to go buy that.
1257320	1258320	Yeah, yeah.
1258320	1259320	Alright.
1259320	1262280	Anyway, if you wanna join our chat room and participate in the conversations with us,
1262280	1267040	it's chat.orangeloungeradio.com, head on over there, and we got a nice, full chat room tonight,
1267040	1269120	so thanks, you guys, for sticking with us.
1269120	1272280	Some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's news.
1272280	1275320	Earlier in our last week's show, I should say, I promised that there'd be some big changes
1275320	1279720	coming to our website, and realistically, that's probably not gonna happen now until,
1279720	1280720	like, January.
1280720	1284360	We're trying to plan, like, a big overhaul for the website, so stay tuned for that.
1284360	1290640	We know that our website is, it has room for improvements, let's just put it that way,
1290640	1299280	so although we love our webmaster who helps us out, it's just, it's the site itself we
1299280	1302280	just kinda wanna try some different things with, so you can look for that, hopefully
1302280	1304680	in January-ish.
1304680	1310060	Also we should say, this is our last live show of 2006, if you can believe it, because
1310060	1315000	next Sunday is Christmas Eve, and the Sunday after that is New Year's Eve, and of course
1315000	1319920	we have respective, you know, family and friend plans for those days, and we imagine most
1319920	1323520	of you guys do, too, so, you know.
1323520	1325720	They have no lies outside of you, Rob.
1325720	1329480	I like to think that, but no, no, we know that you guys probably have your own things
1329480	1334640	going on, so we will be delivering new content to the podcast feeds, certainly look for,
1334640	1338760	you know, a year-end round-up type show, our top games of the year, those types of things
1338760	1343420	will be pre-recorded and coming to our audio archive, which is available on our website,
1343420	1348220	just click on podcast over at orangeloungeradio.com.
1348220	1353880	One other quick thing I wanted to say, I wanted to give a quick plug for iTunes, and leaving
1353880	1358920	us reviews there, like happy things, because the more reviews we get in iTunes, the more
1358920	1363680	people notice the show, and you know, we're all about, hey, we do this show for free,
1363680	1368960	and we try not to ask for too much, you know, we, in the beginning, I think when we first
1368960	1372240	started podcasting, we got all up on this, oh, you got to vote for us on Podcast Alley
1372240	1375960	and, oh, give us a good thing on Yahoo Podcast, and now we kind of, you know, we're just kind
1375960	1379760	of like, okay, whatever, we just want to, people to spread the word, that's all we ask.
1379760	1384340	If you enjoy the show, tell a friend about the show, you know, tell somebody, you know,
1384340	1388480	but leaving the iTunes reviews, I mean, honestly, iTunes being the biggest thing, that really
1388480	1393180	does help us, because then it boosts our ranking there and what shows up on the front page
1393180	1398360	and all that stuff, and that, so if you don't have any friends to tell, or friends that
1398360	1402960	would appreciate this program, you can leave us a happy review on iTunes and that would
1402960	1407680	be permissible, we'd like that, so, thank you guys, appreciate it.
1407680	1411840	Alright, enough, enough begging and pleading, let's get into some gaming news, the core
1411840	1417160	of what we're about, and, but, but, but begging and pleading is awesome, especially when I
1417160	1418160	get stuff.
1418160	1420000	Well, do you want to beg for something?
1420000	1421000	No.
1421000	1422000	Okay.
1422000	1423000	Are you, are you above begging?
1423000	1424000	I'm above everything.
1424000	1425000	Alright.
1425000	1426000	That's not what she said last night.
1426000	1427000	What?
1427000	1428000	You liked it?
1428000	1429000	What?
1429000	1430000	That's not what she said last night.
1430000	1431000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
1431000	1432000	Yeah, but you didn't argue.
1432000	1437160	Okay, well, this, this sounds like something we ought to send over to Howard Stern instead.
1437160	1439920	La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
1439920	1445440	Let's go to game news, and we'll start off with some kind of exclusive stuff, I think?
1445440	1446440	Yeah.
1446440	1447440	Insider stuff.
1447440	1448560	That's an update to stuff that we mentioned before.
1448560	1452600	Okay, first, you know, because we have new listeners every week, thanks to, like, xbstream
1452600	1456760	and iTunes and people spreading the word and all that, folks may not know how you get some
1456760	1460500	insider information, so really quickly, how do you get insider information, and how reliable
1460500	1461500	is it?
1461500	1465360	I work for a game distributor, and usually the information I get is pretty reliable,
1465360	1470720	seeing as it's coming from the actual companies putting out these games, and we do keep a
1470720	1473600	constant update with a lot of them, especially through the holidays, because we're cutting
1473600	1476640	POs, like, every day and stuff, so.
1476640	1480120	But I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be the devil's advocate here, you know, just going from your
1480120	1486480	track record in 2006, it's a little bit hit and miss, like, we found that your ties really
1486480	1490960	tell us, like, the new games that are coming out, like, you knew about PlayStation 3 Oblivion
1490960	1495440	long before anyone else did, and mentioned it on this program, obviously, one of the
1495440	1500160	big things that had us out there in 2006 was the Konami before E3, you knew there were
1500160	1504340	gonna be two DDRs for Xbox, Xbox 360, you knew there was a Castlevania game coming on
1504340	1505840	DS, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
1505840	1506840	Release dates?
1506840	1509160	It's harder because the companies move them around.
1509160	1514360	It's really companies that move that shit around because I wish it were, you know, announce
1514360	1520080	a release date and actually the game comes out, you know, that day, but that's usually
1520080	1524320	not the case because they're shifting their priorities around, you know, working on certain
1524320	1529480	games, certain games are behind in development or ahead in development or, you know, certain
1529480	1534780	games are done and they're just waiting for, you know, certification, so, there's a lot
1534780	1539620	of factors that shift the dates around every day, you know, type of things.
1539620	1543300	Alright, so you have release date news now for two big games.
1543300	1544300	Two big games.
1544300	1547660	One that we've been talking about forever on this program, and one kind of for me a
1547660	1549620	surprising move, but anyway, I'll shut up.
1549620	1554060	Anyways, so, of course we mentioned the big, it was the big news, you know, we mentioned
1554060	1557620	back that Halo 3 will be coming out March 15th.
1557620	1561660	It has been delayed a little bit, you know, probably because they're not done with it
1561660	1569640	yet, but the new date now from Microsoft is May 15th, and, you know, who knows, that could
1569640	1574420	change once we get closer to May, but as of right now, it is May 15th.
1574420	1578580	Now that date makes a little bit of sense, and in some ways and not in others.
1578580	1582020	To me it makes sense because of the beta test that was almost going to happen in March.
1582020	1586300	That's the appropriate time frame, right, but, so we knew that March date was going
1586300	1587500	out the window when they announced it.
1587500	1590820	And the March date too, it would make sense too that they'd move, because they've got
1590820	1595920	other games coming out in March, and to stack three Microsoft games in one month, I mean,
1595920	1599420	they don't want one game, especially Halo 3, they don't want that detracting from the
1599420	1603060	sales of other games, so, you know, you want to move stuff around.
1603060	1605700	But one of the other big things that pointed towards the possible spring release was the
1605700	1610580	whole fiscal year thing, and now May 15th is now a new fiscal year, so that's kind of
1610580	1613820	one of the things where I go, well, that's different, but maybe do they just, you know,
1613820	1618500	trying to have a lot of, because maybe they think Sony and Nintendo are not going to have
1618500	1620560	a lot of big titles in 2008?
1620560	1621560	And usually...
1621560	1623900	Or I should say the 07-08 fiscal year?
1623900	1629580	Well usually April-May is pretty slow, I mean, I think, what, last year, or I should say
1629580	1635940	this year, during May, the big game release was, well, they had X-Men 3, Hitman Blood
1635940	1642460	Money, and Jaws Unleashed, so, I mean, that's not really that big, I mean, when you think
1642460	1645020	about it.
1645020	1648420	So it makes sense that they would, you know, kind of push it back, because there's a lot
1648420	1653140	of games coming out, and they also, you know, they're pushing to sell more hardware units
1653140	1659260	right now, and I think a lot of people are buying 360s, because, again, can't get a hold
1659260	1664620	of a Playstation 3, and kind of listening to what they're doing with a Playstation 3
1664620	1668140	and how they're still having trouble getting units out there, despite the fact that they're
1668140	1672460	still seeing 2 million by the end of the year, right?
1672460	1675980	It's probably, they're thinking that's going to be when they're starting to catch up a
1675980	1679100	little bit, and then they just need something else to kind of pull the attention away from
1679100	1680580	Sony type thing.
1680580	1686300	So, you know, that could change, I mean, also Forza 2 was scheduled for May now, so there's
1686300	1691660	a lot of stuff that's being, you know, delayed, and, you know, I'm not surprised.
1691660	1696820	The other game that got delayed, though, into February, is Wii Play, and that I'm kind of
1696820	1700860	surprised about, because the game's done, and it's just, I was surprised to hear that
1700860	1705020	one too, when you posted in our, you know, obviously Wii host discussed what we were going
1705020	1707820	to talk about on the show beforehand, and I was kind of surprised to read that too,
1707820	1711780	because I was thinking the same thing, the game's done, why do they need to push it back
1711780	1712780	to February?
1712780	1713780	Is there that much localization?
1713780	1718300	Unless they're worried that Warrior Aware's going to take away from it or something, which
1718300	1721580	I don't understand why they would do that, but, whatever the case may be, Wii Play's
1721580	1727340	delayed to February 20th, it used to be actually one month prior, I think on January 19th is
1727340	1731740	when we had it before, which is great, because that was, you know, the two games I was going
1731740	1734280	to get for the Wii, because that was pretty much it, that was coming out.
1734280	1737660	Would it be production issues because of the free remote that comes with it?
1737660	1741380	It's possible that they just don't have enough remotes to go with it, and that would make
1741380	1742380	sense.
1742380	1744800	Or, you know, as we're going to talk about a little later on in Part B, which I'm sure
1744800	1747260	a lot of folks have heard about on the internet this week, the fact that they're going to
1747260	1751060	have to go back and change a lot of the remotes, could that be doing with it?
1751060	1758180	They started shipping those new remotes with the new straps since the Australian launch,
1758180	1764180	and they've even had some, actually, all the remotes and systems that are shipped after
1764180	1770540	this Monday will have the new straps in them, so, not really, I don't think that's a huge
1770540	1774740	issue because, you know, the straps are easy to manufacture, it's probably the remotes
1774740	1778500	because they're really having trouble getting a lot of accessories out.
1778500	1779500	Interesting.
1779500	1785040	All right, well, thank you very much for the, I guess, exclusive news, and we'll see how
1785040	1786040	it plays out.
1786040	1791420	I mean, I look for date changes every single day, three times, four times a day, and Halo,
1791420	1793900	as soon as I saw that change, I had two times a day.
1793900	1797500	But that also kind of makes me go, okay, well, what's to say it's not going to move again?
1797500	1798500	And I don't know.
1798500	1802140	I don't know if it's not going to move again, and really, it could just, I've seen games
1802140	1806580	that were scheduled to come out last year, and now they're scheduled to come out in 2007,
1806580	1812680	so it all depends on how quickly, you know, they're getting the game done.
1812680	1817540	I would trust your date more than the, you know, placeholders that people use on EB Games
1817540	1818540	and GameStop.
1818540	1820180	You know, they go, oh, the game's coming out 11-1.
1820180	1824020	Well, yeah, they're saying, oh, it's going to come out for Christmas because they want
1824020	1825340	to sell it during Christmas.
1825340	1828820	That may be, they may want to try to sell it on the anniversary of Halo or something
1828820	1833820	like that, but I don't think that they're really going to hold to that, you know, just
1833820	1837260	because, I don't know, they'll sell it when it's done.
1837260	1840100	All right, well, the game will be out when it's out, so we'll see if you were right or
1840100	1842100	not, Loki.
1842100	1851900	Well, there have been some strange goings-on, at least concerning Microsoft and Halo 3.
1851900	1860900	Apparently, there was a site in Europe that was trying to sell the promotional codes for
1860900	1865900	the Halo 3 beta that are actually supposed to be given out as a promotional item, so
1865900	1869140	they've been, they've had the major smackdown on them.
1869140	1872940	And basically, they are not going to receive the beta codes.
1872940	1879780	They're being removed from the Xbox community network immediately.
1879780	1885820	They are, Microsoft is not going to have any involvement with their sites.
1885820	1889060	They're completely cutting them off.
1889060	1893140	No, no goods, no nothing.
1893140	1896140	You've been excommunicated from the Church of the Gates.
1896140	1897140	Seriously.
1897140	1901180	But it's basically people trying to turn a profit on something that doesn't really belong
1901180	1902180	to them to sell.
1902180	1905180	Well, yeah, they shouldn't do that crap, you know.
1905180	1907180	I say they have it coming.
1907180	1909900	I'm kind of glad Microsoft is laying the smackdown, you know.
1909900	1911220	Let's hear it for some values.
1911220	1912780	There you go.
1912780	1913780	What?
1913780	1915540	Microsoft is going to have to choke a bitch.
1915540	1917860	Is Bill Gates going to have to choke a bitch?
1917860	1922740	All right, I guess that would more be like probably Peter Moore choking a bitch, or Major
1922740	1923740	Nelson.
1923740	1926140	Maybe we'll see why they call him Major.
1926140	1927140	Anyway.
1927140	1932820	Why is somebody in the chat room named Marky Mark?
1932820	1934620	That's funny.
1934620	1936060	Maybe that's their name.
1936060	1939900	Maybe the Funky Bunch is not far behind, or maybe they hear that line a lot.
1939900	1940900	That's fantastic.
1940900	1944620	Marky Mark, you are the chat room hero.
1944620	1946460	But look, Marky Mark is the first to bitch though.
1946460	1947620	Why all this old news?
1947620	1949620	Well, you know, we do a show weekly.
1949620	1955080	I don't know if you heard, but we do a show weekly, so sometimes we have to do stories
1955080	1956500	that might have come out on Monday.
1956500	1957500	I don't know.
1957500	1963900	Well, something that came out mid-week was a brand new update for Xbox 360 backward compatibility,
1963900	1967940	and a bunch of new games have been announced as finally being backwards compatible on the
1967940	1974000	Xbox 360, and the short list would include games such as Destroy All Humans, Buffy the
1974000	1980260	Vampire Slayer, Family Guy, Mortal Kombat Armageddon, Psychonauts, which a lot of folks
1980260	1987620	are waiting for, Scarface, Soul Calibur 2, and a lot of other titles, many, many, many
1987620	1992740	titles, and the list is now over 300 original Xbox titles.
1992740	1995140	If you want to see the complete list, you can check that out.
1995140	1999820	Major Nelson posted a list on his blog, or you can head over to the Xbox official website
1999820	2001380	to check that out.
2001380	2002380	Yes.
2002380	2003380	Yes, ma'am.
2003380	2007420	For dumb people, what does backwards compatibility mean?
2007420	2008420	Oh, no.
2008420	2009420	Not a problem.
2009420	2014220	I mean, you play casual games, but you do more computer gaming, right, than you do console?
2014220	2015620	I don't do a lot of console games.
2015620	2017860	I mostly do, yeah, computer games.
2017860	2018860	Not a problem.
2018860	2021380	I do not know what backwards- A gamer on a Mac!
2021380	2022380	Not a problem.
2022380	2023380	Shut up!
2023380	2024380	No, I'm pointing out.
2024380	2025380	Mac games.
2025380	2029380	No, well, people, bitch, we don't cover enough computer gaming on this show, so I'm glad
2029380	2030380	to hear that.
2030380	2033540	So, no, backwards compatible means, you know how there's the original Xbox and the Xbox
2033540	2034540	360?
2034540	2038340	Well, like, you know, when PlayStation came out, everybody, you know, one of the biggest
2038340	2041660	things about the PlayStation 2 is that, oh, all my old PlayStation games will work on
2041660	2042660	it.
2042660	2045580	When PlayStation 3 came out, it was, oh, you know, all my old PlayStation 2 games will
2045580	2047300	work on it, and so on and so on.
2047300	2052640	But when the Xbox 360 came out, it was, well, we have software emulation because we changed
2052640	2058580	our graphics chip, so some of the games will work on it, and we'll release updates every
2058580	2061820	so often, and we're going to get 99% of our library.
2061820	2062820	What did he say?
2062820	2065540	It was supposed to be every month, and it's been every six months or whatever.
2065540	2069340	Needless to say, Microsoft hasn't been quite as speedy as we would have liked, but they're
2069340	2072900	trying to get more of the old-school Xbox titles playable.
2072900	2074540	Not a problem.
2074540	2075540	Not a problem.
2075540	2076540	Anyways.
2076540	2083340	So, yeah, speaking of, you know, being behind on updates and stuff, well, one of the updates
2083340	2089300	that just recently happened to the dashboard is causing a lot of stir, especially with
2089300	2094300	people claiming that it's bricked their console and now they want their share of the profits.
2094300	2101060	So, as we mentioned last week, there was a class-action lawsuit filed by some guy for
2101060	2107300	damages basically caused by this update, and now there's been some actual updates to this
2107300	2109460	and what exactly it was about.
2109460	2117500	The whole premise of this class-action lawsuit was they claimed that because of this update,
2117500	2122060	they had to have their console fixed, and Microsoft wanted $140 to fix their console
2122060	2125300	instead of doing it for free because it was their fault.
2125300	2130900	And so, he's basically saying that they're using this to profit from it.
2130900	2137940	And he's seeking $5 million in damages, which is basically just to get them into the correct
2137940	2138940	courthouse.
2138940	2146120	They, you know, will of course adjust the amount depending on how many people are claiming
2146120	2148260	to have the same problem.
2148260	2155140	Right now, it's about 400 people, or 1% of, well they're saying 1% of the 360 owners right
2155140	2159380	now have this problem, and 400 people have come forward saying that they do have this
2159380	2160380	problem.
2160380	2166080	But, you know, I think, I thought that what I heard before that they were fixing these
2166080	2170380	for free, you know, the ones that were, you know, affected by this because I guess they'd
2170380	2173940	pop up a certain error code and they would just be able to replace the console for free,
2173940	2178220	but I mean, if it's actually true that they're charging $140 to fix the console, then yeah,
2178220	2179220	he's right.
2179220	2182340	Well, it sounds to me like it took a minute for the left hand to tell the right hand what
2182340	2183340	was going on.
2183340	2184340	I think so.
2184340	2186860	You know, it's such a big company like Microsoft, I'm thinking these people got told they were
2186860	2189820	going to have to pay before they realized the scope of what was happening.
2189820	2190820	You know what I mean?
2190820	2191820	I think so, yeah.
2191820	2194060	That sounds like what happened to me.
2194060	2195540	But I don't think that, I mean...
2195540	2201620	No, I think if Microsoft realized their error, apologized for it, and fixed the machines,
2201620	2203160	there should not be a lawsuit.
2203160	2204160	There shouldn't be a lawsuit.
2204160	2207780	People have a right to be mad at them and question, you know, if they want to trust
2207780	2210380	them in the future, but lawsuits are totally unnecessary.
2210380	2213740	Here's what they need to do, and this is basically what they did before with the overheating
2213740	2215420	problem with the consoles.
2215420	2220020	People had to send them in to get fixed, say they sent it in to get fixed for this specific
2220020	2221020	issue.
2221020	2225620	If they paid the money to have it fixed, they would be refunded this money.
2225620	2229740	If they haven't, you know, sent it in yet, they would be fixing them for free.
2229740	2234040	It's just like they did with the consoles sold at launch that were having heating issues
2234040	2239340	and if your console bricked because of that, they would fix it for free, or they will send
2239340	2243620	you a refund for the amount that you paid to fix it.
2243620	2246220	And I was pissed when my console bricked.
2246220	2250180	Go back and listen to a show around, it was around Valentine's Day when this happened,
2250180	2252720	and I was pissed when my console bricked.
2252720	2258500	And I said a lot of nasty things about Microsoft, but when we say a console was bricked, Chris
2258500	2259500	is like, bricked?
2259500	2263220	When we say a console is bricked, that means it broke, so you can't do anything but hold
2263220	2266980	down paper with it, essentially, that's why we call it bricks.
2266980	2268660	I'm helping people who may not know that.
2268660	2269660	That's all right.
2269660	2273260	And then also the other cool term I like is that they send you a coffin, and the coffin
2273260	2277260	is what you put the brick in because you're sending it back to Microsoft to be buried.
2277260	2282200	I wish though, I understand why they want to do these lawsuits and stuff, but I really
2282200	2287540	wish that people would just have better communication with these companies and I'm sure that they
2287540	2293140	could resolve it out of court instead of saying, I'm going to sue you until you do what I say,
2293140	2300820	and they really just need to open more of a discussion before going and throwing lawsuits
2300820	2301820	down.
2301820	2302820	Because you know what?
2302820	2307100	I can bet you that within a few weeks we'll be reporting that someone's going to file
2307100	2314020	a class action lawsuit over this goddamn Wiimote strap shit because, oh, they knew it was broken
2314020	2315700	because that's why they're fixing it.
2315700	2316860	Well, you know what?
2316860	2320980	There was actually some companies that did some, or I should say websites that did independent
2320980	2325660	testing on this, and that fucking wrist strap held enough weight, okay?
2325660	2329620	What you're doing is beyond abuse.
2329620	2331020	We'll get into the Wii stuff later.
2331020	2332020	We're still on Xbox now.
2332020	2333020	Whatever.
2333020	2334020	Calm down, Loki.
2334020	2335020	Calm down.
2335020	2336020	All right.
2336020	2337020	Anyway, I wanted to read some chat comments.
2337020	2339820	First off, I want to clear Marky Mark's name because I said earlier that he said that we
2339820	2344140	were reporting old news, but he was actually talking about the chat room was talking about
2344140	2345140	old news.
2345140	2349480	Marky Mark says, our news rocks, and he still loves us, so thank you, and I wanted to clear
2349480	2353940	his name there, and you all can play nicely with Marky Mark because he seems like a good
2353940	2354940	guy.
2354940	2357440	We have a lot of new people in chat tonight.
2357440	2358440	This is awesome.
2358440	2362500	Thanks, you guys, for coming in the live experience, and if anyone else ever wants to join us live,
2362500	2367540	we tape Sundays at 6 o'clock Pacific time, although you'll have to wait until 2007 to
2367540	2368780	really pick that up again.
2368780	2372120	I guess our first live show would be, what, January 6th or whatever that first Sunday
2372120	2375100	is in January, so look for us then.
2375100	2377260	All right.
2377260	2378980	Is there any other chat comments here?
2378980	2384780	A lot of folks going back and forth between the lawsuit, DDRDollarBill says, I will sue
2384780	2386320	for stubbing my toe.
2386320	2387820	Maybe that's from playing too much DDR.
2387820	2389820	That's from Weird Al.
2389820	2393340	Mystic, oh, is that what, oh, the Weird Al song that Jamie was playing in her car the
2393340	2395980	other day, because I was going to say, this whole thing makes me think of that Weird Al
2395980	2396980	song about all the lawsuits.
2396980	2397980	No, that's the New Jersey one.
2397980	2398980	That one was funny.
2398980	2399980	All right.
2399980	2404260	Anyway, let's keep it moving with some more gaming news.
2404260	2405980	But I don't want to move.
2405980	2406980	I'm comfortable.
2406980	2410380	Well, I will pick you up and throw you.
2410380	2411380	No.
2411380	2418380	Well, speaking of throwing, we had someone throw up some secret information, apparently.
2418380	2424540	And I'm sure everyone's familiar with the actress Kristen Bell, yes?
2424540	2425540	Veronica Mars?
2425540	2426540	Yeah.
2426540	2429060	Well, that's one of Extrovert's favorite shows.
2429060	2432420	I need to watch that show because apparently Joss is a big fan.
2432420	2433420	Apparently.
2433420	2434420	I haven't, I'll be honest.
2434420	2435800	And Joss Whedon is my lord and master.
2435800	2438140	I haven't watched it, but I want to.
2438140	2439820	Joss Whedon is my master now.
2439820	2441740	Right now, Heroes is my lord and master.
2441740	2444620	That is the best damn show I've watched in like the past five years.
2444620	2447740	Those fuckers are making us wait until January for new episodes.
2447740	2448740	I hate them.
2448740	2453780	I need, okay, the Lost fans have to wait till February.
2453780	2454780	Shut up.
2454780	2455780	They're still Lost fans.
2455780	2456780	The Lost sucks.
2456780	2457780	Wait, wait, wait.
2457780	2463560	I do, by the way, have to thank our friends at Pod Culture for sending me 11 episodes of
2463560	2466060	Heroes so I can get started.
2466060	2467820	All I have to say, you'll love Peter.
2467820	2468820	He's the bomb.
2468820	2469820	You'll love him.
2469820	2470820	Okay.
2470820	2471820	All right.
2471820	2476740	Well, back to the story.
2476740	2481100	There's a game coming out called Assassin's Creed that's out by Ubisoft.
2481100	2484540	Well, she sort of spilled the beans.
2484540	2489660	She said, to quote, it's sort of based on the research that's sort of happening now,
2489660	2492900	but the fact that your genes might be able to hold memory.
2492900	2496460	And you could argue semantics and say it's instinct, but how does a baby bird know how
2496460	2500100	to eat a worm as opposed to a cockroach if its parents don't show it?
2500100	2506980	I guess she's talking about genetic memory and all that, but she's just going into all
2506980	2511220	this stuff about what's in the game, and Ubi hasn't confirmed her diet or anything, but
2511220	2515340	I just think it's funny that she spilled the stuff they've been trying to hold back.
2515340	2516740	Well, she probably didn't know any better.
2516740	2519860	I mean, I have this feeling she probably doesn't read video game blogs in her spare time.
2519860	2521860	They didn't have her sign an NDA.
2521860	2527220	Or maybe she doesn't realize that she's spilling plot details that weren't ready to be spilled
2527220	2528220	yet.
2528220	2529220	It's probably just an innocent mistake.
2529220	2530220	But it's still funny.
2530220	2531540	Oh yeah, it's kind of funny.
2531540	2536740	And my favorite thing about this, I actually get this story from Eurogamer, they are fantastic.
2536740	2541340	I just love that they call it Ass Creed in the title.
2541340	2549940	Well, not exactly off topic here, but I'm officially boycotting Ubisoft games.
2549940	2550940	Why?
2550940	2563180	Because Ubisoft, their last few games have really blown, and I think back to everything
2563180	2568540	that I've bought from them, I mean, granted, Ghost Recon and Tom Clancy games aren't really
2568540	2577500	my cup of tea, but the stuff for the Wii, Red Steel, Blue, GT sucked, Monster 4x4 sucked,
2577500	2582980	the Wii version of Splinter Cell sucked, Far Cry sucks.
2582980	2586020	I'm not buying anymore of your games, seriously.
2586020	2590580	Rayman's Ray of the Rapids was okay, but still kind of sucked.
2590580	2592260	And Shannon Arms wasn't bad.
2592260	2593260	Didn't they publish that?
2593260	2594260	They didn't make it, but they published it.
2594260	2602740	They published it, okay, but still though, I think that I'm done with Ubisoft, and looking
2602740	2607580	forward to some of the stuff that they have coming out, like, was it Ghost Recon Advanced
2607580	2611540	Warfighter 2, which, by the way, looking at screenshots of that and the original one,
2611540	2615260	you can't tell them apart, I will not be buying that game.
2615260	2622700	I am so inviting somebody from Ubisoft to come on this program in the future.
2622700	2626540	Jeremy Todd 1 says in our chat room, Loki, that's a dumb move.
2626540	2629340	Boycotting games will cause the Wii to turn out the same way as the GameCube.
2629340	2630940	No third party support.
2630940	2634600	If people boycott third party games, then they will stop making games, and the Wii will
2634600	2636580	die just like the GameCube did.
2636580	2638960	I agree and I disagree.
2638960	2645200	I don't think that you should buy a game just to support third party development, but if
2645200	2647980	Loki thinks the game sucks, he shouldn't have to buy it.
2647980	2648980	Exactly.
2648980	2652780	But Loki's just kind of harsh on games, I mean, God, you think GameSpot's bad?
2652780	2653780	I mean...
2653780	2658080	Hey, listen, listen, I'm not harsh on games, it's just, seriously, Red Steel, I had high
2658080	2659080	hopes for this game.
2659080	2661100	You know, it sold the console for me, it was supposed to be like...
2661100	2662220	Well, now who's fault is it?
2662220	2663220	You got your hopes up.
2663220	2667960	Well, when I played the game, it seemed fine, but then somewhere between, you know, playing
2667960	2672680	at E3 and when it came out, they decided to take a giant dump on it, and, you know, and
2672680	2677600	apparently, you know, the game sucks, and trying to play multiplayer is like playing
2677600	2681820	the goddamn game with Parkinson's or something, because the fucking remote goes all over the
2681820	2682820	goddamn place.
2682820	2683820	So...
2683820	2687060	Take a deep breath in and out.
2687060	2688060	It's awful.
2688060	2690380	It's back on track here, Loki, keep going.
2690380	2694740	Real quick, real quick, Dartick Suya, Loki, Red Steel 2?
2694740	2695740	It's gonna suck.
2695740	2698380	I'm not buying it.
2698380	2702060	It'll just be the same damn fucking engine, okay, they can go back and tweak it and make
2702060	2708460	it a little bit better, but please, you know, take a page from Capcom, listen to the goddamn
2708460	2710780	feedback from the people that play your games.
2710780	2716240	James Patrick, Red Steel is better than Killzone and Mace Griffin on PS2, Red Steel isn't
2716240	2718100	that bad.
2718100	2723660	Okay, Killzone on PlayStation 2, that game is fucking old, and, granted, the game itself,
2723660	2726660	I mean, is probably pretty good, it's just the controls that suck, and that's what's
2726660	2730980	really bad about it, is the fact that they really fucked up what could have been a good
2730980	2731980	game.
2731980	2733940	Black Boy says, I kinda liked Red Steel.
2733940	2736940	Good, to each their own, but you know what?
2736940	2739900	There's people out there that are actually gonna put down money for Splinter Cell Double
2739900	2744440	Agent on the Wii, and I go, why, but, whatever.
2744440	2750260	Go ahead, buy GT and Monster 4x4 for the Wii, because those aren't like old GameCube games
2750260	2753380	or something that they just re-released and tacked on controls to.
2753380	2755420	Oh wait, no, they are.
2755420	2759540	Alright, I see Jamie twiddling her thumbs over there, she's sick of Loki bitching, she's
2759540	2761660	ready to get to a new story, aren't you?
2761660	2762660	Aren't you, Dark Sakura?
2762660	2765500	Alright, well, I have a story about Luminous.
2765500	2766500	You like Luminous, right?
2766500	2767500	I like Luminous.
2767500	2772220	Do you like Luminous on the Xbox 360?
2772220	2773220	I'll take that as a no.
2773220	2774220	I haven't played Luminous.
2774220	2775220	Oh, okay.
2775220	2780940	I was like, I don't know how to answer that, because I like Luminous, and I like the Xbox
2780940	2781940	360.
2781940	2782940	Here's the thing.
2782940	2787220	Luminous on the 360 is great, except for the Xbox 360 controller.
2787220	2789640	And the fact that, you know, you have all these microtransactions, and the fact that
2789640	2795460	if you own the PSP version, there's really not a lot of reason to get Luminous on 360.
2795460	2800300	But if you don't have a PSP, you really should have Luminous on the 360.
2800300	2803060	But anyway, there's a reason why I bring this up.
2803060	2807420	Xbox and Microsoft apparently thinks more people should be playing Luminous, and they
2807420	2810060	are going to have an official competition.
2810060	2815860	It's the Xbox Live Arcade Challenge, and it's going to feature Luminous Live starting today,
2815860	2818660	the 17th, and it's going to run through the 23rd of December.
2818660	2823740	So if you think you're good at Luminous, specifically the 60-second attack mode, if you can make
2823740	2827900	a ton of bricks in the 60-second attack mode, I mean, it doesn't take long to try, you should
2827900	2834140	enter this contest, and you might win a 42-inch Hitachi Plasma HD TV.
2834140	2840020	Four runners up will get an HD DVD bundle, a wireless headset, and the 360 wireless racing
2840020	2841020	wheel.
2841020	2846220	A hundred ranking players, like the next hundred ranking players, will get 500 Microsoft Points
2846220	2851720	tokens to be redeemed for Xbox Live imagery, which I'm assuming means you can't buy games
2851720	2853380	with it.
2853380	2856420	Probably because it would, I'm assuming the reason why is because it would screw up the
2856420	2860220	reimbursement to the creators of the game, which is why they forced you to get imagery
2860220	2861220	with it.
2861220	2865420	But if you really wanted a Halo theme that you have to pay for or something, I guess,
2865420	2868020	you know, you could place in the top 100 and get it.
2868020	2871860	By the way, they're also doing Small Arms, and that is running from the 24th of this
2871860	2874140	month through the 30th.
2874140	2876860	So you only have to be in the top 105.
2876860	2878060	So get to work.
2878060	2882220	I'd like to see some OL Army members win some Xbox Live imagery.
2882220	2884300	Wouldn't that be fun?
2884300	2888380	Do I have to buy into this competition for Lumenus, because, you know, you have to buy
2888380	2891900	the game, but I believe everything else you have to purchase.
2891900	2894140	No, I don't believe so.
2894140	2897960	They should have had a, you know, a thing that you have to purchase to, like, turn the
2897960	2899940	game off or something.
2899940	2903100	The tournament skin or whatever?
2903100	2904100	The power button skin?
2904100	2905100	All right, forget it.
2905100	2907100	Let's keep them moving.
2907100	2914260	Anyways, so, um, God, I hate Lumenus, but Lumenus is great.
2914260	2918140	I love, like, I love Lumenus for PSP.
2918140	2923260	It was my absolute favorite game that came out last year, you know, and I love Mizuguchi.
2923260	2925060	I think the man's a god.
2925060	2927100	I forgive him for 99 Nights.
2927100	2928580	Even I didn't think that game was that bad.
2928580	2931700	I found the good in 99 Nights, okay?
2931700	2936080	Every extend extra I ran out and bought, but anyway, Lumenus 2 is, like, if you didn't
2936080	2938420	have Lumenus 1, Lumenus 2 is, like, really good.
2938420	2941300	And even if you're a fan of Lumenus, Lumenus 2 is really, really good.
2941300	2942300	It really is.
2942300	2945380	So, you're just hating on puzzle games, you're hating on everything today.
2945380	2950540	Um, so, if you're looking for some better games to be coming out, the XNA is definitely
2950540	2955300	one way that might happen, especially since now it's allowing a lot of independent developers
2955300	2961300	to create their own Xbox Live Arcade games, or possibly Xbox Live Arcade games, but they're
2961300	2967480	saying that basically the XNA is going to become the YouTube for games, so I have to
2967480	2972500	ask, are these going to be games that are reruns of shows that were on the night before
2972500	2977480	that I can catch in case I missed, you know, or is it going to be, like, you know, knock-offs
2977480	2983180	of everything, or, you know, I'm going to see Game A with music from Game B or something.
2983180	2987500	Will I see 13-year-old girls at their slumber parties lip-syncing Britney Spears into their
2987500	2988500	hairdryers?
2988500	2989900	I mean, is that what XNA is going to do for me?
2989900	2992100	Is that how it becomes the YouTube of games?
2992100	2996760	Basically, they're just trying to take the YouTube concept and bring it into games, basically
2996760	3000860	like a community arcade, to be able to share your own games with the whole community.
3000860	3004640	But you have to buy into this community in order to be able to do that, so it's not like
3004640	3007120	you're really going to break through on this huge scale.
3007120	3009720	You know, I have to give one of our buddies a plug here.
3009720	3013300	Our old buddy Bobby Blackwolf over at All Games Radio, I was listening to his show a
3013300	3017300	little bit before we went live tonight, and he does a lot of in-depth on XNA this week,
3017300	3020760	because he does certainly more game programming than I've ever done, so he actually downloaded
3020760	3023640	it and was trying to make a card game in it, so it's kind of interesting to hear about
3023640	3027840	what the thing will do and won't let you do, and kind of the ease of use in the program.
3027840	3031920	So he's over at allgames.com if you want to check out his show, since I don't program,
3031920	3034800	so I don't really see the point in getting XNA.
3034800	3036760	I mean, is this something you do, Loki?
3036760	3039760	You're a little more of a dissecting things than I am.
3039760	3043320	I think I downloaded it, and I'm like, I don't have the fuck to use this, and then I deleted
3043320	3044320	it.
3044320	3047540	So yeah, I don't have to pay $99 a year for YouTube, so I don't understand how this...
3047540	3053480	You only have to pay $99, I believe, to play the games on your Xbox 360.
3053480	3058080	You can distribute them for free using Windows.
3058080	3062400	You can play the games on Windows, and apparently I guess the wired controllers and the wireless
3062400	3069880	ones, once that wireless adapter comes out, all the XNA games will support those controllers.
3069880	3075200	You don't necessarily need to buy into this yet, but I would like to see an open place
3075200	3081600	where you can play some games or download some free arcade games, that'd be nice.
3081600	3086360	Funny Dale says, XNA will never be YouTube because 90% of people are too stupid to use
3086360	3087360	XNA.
3087360	3088360	You know what, though?
3088360	3090920	Could you imagine if they banned stupid people from YouTube?
3090920	3094120	There'd be no YouTube.
3094120	3097840	There'd be no more really awful music videos.
3097840	3100480	I know, it would be something else.
3100480	3103200	Could you imagine if YouTube made you take an IQ test?
3103200	3105320	They should make you take an IQ test before you read.
3105320	3108960	I should make a website called IQTube.
3108960	3109960	That would be...
3109960	3110960	You'd better patent that.
3110960	3117920	You know, there's people coming on, so here's my opinion about this, I think this is like,
3117920	3122080	not right, and you know, people shouldn't really do that, and you know, I just got my
3122080	3123080	hair done.
3123080	3131760	Britney Spears, I really want you to put on panties, why won't you listen to me, girl?
3131760	3132760	Britney Spears is listening to you.
3132760	3135160	She's actually listening to you on YouTube.
3135160	3140440	She's searching for your blog.
3140440	3143440	Now there's a game I'd like to see in XNA.
3143440	3147160	Help Britney Spears dress herself.
3147160	3148160	Why not?
3148160	3150960	They made Britney Spears dance beat.
3150960	3154440	I saw the greatest thing, I thought about getting this for you for Christmas.
3154440	3161780	They had it at some stupid jewelry store or whatever, it was a DVR-like game, but it was
3161780	3163480	to teach you how to cheerlead.
3163480	3168000	Oh my god, I saw commercials for that, that was so fucking hilarious.
3168000	3171320	It's like, okay girls, go!
3171320	3172320	Pom pom.
3172320	3174760	Isn't that just like Para Para paradise?
3174760	3177580	Not really, okay.
3177580	3184320	It's like an exercise video except you're on like a DVR-type mat, so it was funny.
3184320	3185320	Alright.
3185320	3188720	Well hey, how about something different?
3188720	3189720	Sure, like what?
3189720	3192320	Than cheerleaders, how about release dates?
3192320	3195640	Okay, now let's talk about some games we'll actually get to play.
3195640	3202480	Well, I have our UK release dates, and just as a disclaimer, again, a few weeks ago we
3202480	3205800	got a notice that people in other parts of Europe would like to hear the things from
3205800	3206800	their areas.
3206800	3210960	Haven't found anywhere quite reliable yet, so I'm going to go ahead and give the UK releases
3210960	3211960	for this week.
3211960	3212960	How's that sound?
3212960	3213960	Swell.
3213960	3217840	Well, it could be swell, but the swelling eventually goes down.
3217840	3220080	Get to the damn release dates.
3220080	3223280	Oh come on, that was funny.
3223280	3224280	Chris laughed.
3224280	3232200	Anyway, coming out, oh, stop that, okay, hey, and it's kind of funny because this game's
3232200	3235000	coming out on the winter solstice.
3235000	3239760	The 21st, we have Sam & Max Episode 2, Situation Comedy for the PC.
3239760	3246840	The 22nd, Marvel Ultimate Alliance on Wii, Open Seasons, Star Trek Legacy, Wii Sports
3246840	3254200	on Christmas Day, which is bizarre, and then a few other to-be-announced ones, The Silent
3254200	3261000	Hill Origins, Point Blank, Limbo of the Lost, which just sounds very interesting.
3261000	3262720	That's it, really not too much else.
3262720	3266640	Wow, all right, well, you know, what's to be expected right before Christmas?
3266640	3270480	Well, actually, if you're in Japan, you have a lot of other options.
3270480	3273600	Xbox 360 over in Japan, again, these Japanese release dates.
3273600	3279440	Lost Planet coming out on December 21st, Madden NFL 07 if you're a football fan in Japan.
3279440	3285440	Need for Speed Carbon and Sonic the Hedgehog all making their way to the Xbox 360 on December
3285440	3286440	21st.
3286440	3291260	PlayStation 3 is going to see Armored Core 4 on the 21st, also their version of Need
3291260	3295000	for Speed Carbon and their version of Sonic the Hedgehog all making their way to the PlayStation
3295000	3296000	3.
3296000	3299600	Over on Nintendo Wii, guess what, Need for Speed Carbon, because that game comes out
3299600	3300600	everywhere.
3300600	3306300	We're getting Monster 4x4 World Circuit from Ubisoft, hooray!
3306300	3312440	On the PlayStation 2, School Love, which is our game name of the week, School Love comes
3312440	3315920	out, also a limited edition.
3315920	3320720	This game is made by Views, and again, it's a PlayStation 2 game, and of course, what
3320720	3326140	Japanese release would be incomplete without the anime-looking cute girls in uniforms on
3326140	3329960	the cover with the name School Love underneath that.
3329960	3331560	Dating Sim, right?
3331560	3336360	I think that's what it looks like, because I'm looking at the little screenshot pictures
3336360	3337360	here.
3337360	3338360	That's a Dating Sim.
3338360	3339360	Yeah, it looks like a Dating Sim.
3339360	3344400	So if you have ever wanted to date school girls in the comfort of your own home...
3344400	3346000	I actually own a Dating Sim.
3346000	3347000	Really?
3347000	3351480	Well, okay, it has a Dating Sim, and it sort of, um, I have the Rival Schools Evolution,
3351480	3354360	or I should say, uh, Shiri to Justice Kakuen.
3354360	3359160	Um, I bought the Evolution disc, I paid like $90 for that, but it has a high school simulator
3359160	3363240	in there, where a Batsu asks you out on a date for your birthday, and then you play
3363240	3366520	sort of Rival Schools DDR.
3366520	3367520	It's really bizarre.
3367520	3370280	I have Yowie Dating Sims, those are always fun.
3370280	3374160	The only Dating Sim I ever played was a DS game called Sprung, and it's the biggest piece
3374160	3376000	of shit game I've ever played in my life.
3376000	3378200	It was a piece of shit.
3378200	3380200	If you own Sprung, burn it.
3380200	3381200	Actually...
3381200	3383320	Watching it on fire will be more entertaining than playing the game.
3383320	3387660	I have one more Sim game, like the Interactive Sims, as I have, um, one of the Evangelion
3387660	3388660	games on Saturn.
3388660	3389660	Alright.
3389660	3390660	The rest...
3390660	3391660	Is that the porn one?
3391660	3392660	Not the porn one.
3392660	3394760	I gotta get to the rest of the releases, because there's some big stuff in here.
3394760	3400840	Secret of Evangelion, speaking of Evangelion, Secret of Evangelion coming out from Jinx,
3400840	3406580	also in Japan on PlayStation 2, and, uh, Squeenix fanboys, prepare thy selves, here comes your
3406580	3413040	fanboy boner, Seiken Detsetsu 4, also known as Dawn of Mana, December 21st, this week.
3413040	3417400	I need new pants.
3417400	3419600	There goes her boner.
3419600	3425800	On the Nintendo DS, you have a cute pouch, DS Lite, oh, these are like just little pouches,
3425800	3432160	I think, uh, Angel Pocket with DS Diary, lots of little things coming out there for the
3432160	3439620	DS accessory-wise, and the sweet pouch, also coming from Konami, but get this, if you cannot
3439620	3447400	get enough hamster action on your Nintendo DS, Hamster 2 Kurasao is coming out on the
3447400	3456240	Nintendo DS in Japan, it's the cutest cover, and look at the cute cover, oh god, hold on,
3456240	3462720	this is great radio, this is great radio, uh, let me post that link in our chat room
3462720	3467000	there if you folks would like to check out the love hamsters there on the DS, they can't,
3467000	3472360	but seriously, can one of our Japanese listeners, because I know we have some, can one of them
3472360	3476200	email me and please tell me what is up with hamsters?
3476200	3481680	You know, I think I want to buy- Apparently they're good for the ass.
3481680	3485480	I think, sadly, that trend was probably started in America.
3485480	3491280	I think I'm going to actually buy one of those DS hamster games, because they have the hamsters
3491280	3498160	ones, unfortunately it's by Ubisoft, so much for your boycott, they have hamster's life
3498160	3503320	or whatever, and you get to create their own little house and stuff, so I might buy that
3503320	3504680	just to try it out.
3504680	3509240	I do have a rebuttal for the chat room, by the way, don't you know Cyberbots is Capcom's
3509240	3510600	number one game?
3510600	3511600	Alright.
3511600	3515400	It was a quote in Puzzle Fighter.
3515400	3519440	There's still more games I gotta get to, this is such a huge week in Japan, it's slow for
3519440	3525120	us but for Japan it's huge, they're getting on the PSP, every extend extra, which we've
3525120	3528520	had here for a couple weeks, it's pretty good, if you like pretty things you should check
3528520	3533320	out every extend extra, and Need for Speed Carbon, and Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops
3533320	3536720	coming out in Japan this week on the 21st.
3536720	3544800	Over on the Dreamcast, oh no, I'm sorry, those dates are in February, nevermind, you gotta
3544800	3549480	ways out, but you will get new games on the 22nd of February, and that's all I care to
3549480	3551360	share with you at this time.
3551360	3555780	If you're looking for games in the United States this week, you're not gonna have much
3555780	3557960	to choose from, actually.
3557960	3567000	Coming out on the PSP we have Metal Slug Anthology, also Bubble Bobble Evolution, and then on
3567000	3572760	Playstation 2 Brave the search for Spirit Dancer, which is delayed since like August,
3572760	3582520	and on PC Paws and Claws Pet School, where you get to cure animals by petting them, and
3582520	3586200	I swear to god, oh my god, cute!
3586200	3587200	That's all you do!
3587200	3591800	Oh, you're dying from cancer, my petting will save you!
3591800	3594920	That's basically this game, I swear to god.
3594920	3600680	And then on the Xbox 360 you're getting Rapala Trophies, because if you really want a really
3600680	3607080	crappy-ass fishing game, there you go, and then Mad Catz, the Xbox Live Arcade Retro
3607080	3612320	Stick, which, people say it's awesome for Xbox Live Arcade games, but I think it looks
3612320	3616840	like a giant piece of crap, so, whatever you wanna, if you wanna buy it, great.
3616840	3620400	Shouldn't you try it before you pass judgement on it here on this program?
3620400	3624720	It just looks awful, dude, it looks, I'm not buying an arcade stick for just a couple Xbox
3624720	3625720	Live Arcade games.
3625720	3629600	I will build my own stick before I go and buy one.
3629600	3632160	But that's it!
3632160	3640400	Yeah, well, I have some game news, and this is fun game news, there's gonna be a new Final
3640400	3653080	Fantasy Tactics on PSP, and they're also doing a sequel to the Game Boy Advance Final Fantasy
3653080	3655080	Tactics Advance.
3655080	3661160	So they actually made the announcement in Shonen Jump, they were still waiting on some
3661160	3666360	details, but the one coming out on PSP is actually called Final Fantasy Tactics Shishi
3666360	3673120	Senso, meaning it's, they're also saying it's gonna be cel-shaded, have new jobs, and is
3673120	3674880	a sequel to the PSX one.
3674880	3678160	Oh, okay, because I heard it was like a direct port of the PlayStation one, but it sounds
3678160	3680280	like they're enhancing it, like a lot of these, you know.
3680280	3681280	It's a sequel.
3681280	3682280	Huh, interesting.
3682280	3683280	I'll be cool.
3683280	3688280	I mean, if it's the same one with more stuff, then that will still be fun, because Final
3688280	3694600	Fantasy Tactics, even though I'm not a fan of tactics games, I think it's cool, I like
3694600	3696360	watching people play them.
3696360	3702520	And then the other one is, that's going to be the sequel to the Game Boy Advance title,
3702520	3705280	and they're not sure what pla- it's not listed what platform it's gonna be on, but it's called
3705280	3717600	Final Fantasy Tactics A2 Fuketsu no Gurimor, Gurimore, I think, Gurimore, yeah, I guess.
3717600	3718600	So yeah.
3718600	3719600	Alright.
3719600	3720600	Well.
3720600	3721600	Yeah!
3721600	3723600	I like Final Fantasy Tactics.
3723600	3724600	Don't laugh at me.
3724600	3728080	I'm not a big fan of tactical games, usually, but Final Fantasy Tactics, you know, because
3728080	3732880	I'm such a Final Fantasy whore, it allows me to cross over into the tactical side.
3732880	3737200	Well, since Dark Sakura brought up the PSP, I suppose this will be a good time for us
3737200	3742520	to talk about that big news in Sony World this week, and by big, I mean their noses,
3742520	3746960	for being big, big liars.
3746960	3753740	If you did not hear yet about the website AllIWantForXmasisapsp.com, seriously, get
3753740	3757080	out there and read some of the funny shit some of the bloggers wrote about it, because
3757080	3761520	here's the story of what happened in a nutshell, and we saw this play out throughout this week.
3761520	3767280	It launched called AllIWantForXmasisapsp.com, and it was basically a blog set up by two
3767280	3773680	kids who surprisingly looked a lot older than the kids they were supposed to be, but whatever.
3773680	3779000	They were kids that really wanted a PSP, and they made these videos and put them on YouTube,
3779000	3782800	you know, singing, all I want is a PSP, da da da, and they were like, you know, dancing
3782800	3788600	around with a PSP and looking really stupid, basically.
3788600	3794040	And what happened is some guy got smart and said, you know, this can't be real.
3794040	3800280	And so they traced up who registered AllIWantForXmasisapsp.com, and the people who registered it was this company
3800280	3801920	called Zippatone.
3801920	3805080	Zippatone is one of Sony's marketing firms.
3805080	3810200	So people, once this caught wind on the game blogs, people started spamming the crap out
3810200	3815980	of this site, you know, liars, we found you out, hi Zippatone, da da da da, and just all
3815980	3818720	this nasty, nasty shit written in these comments.
3818720	3822440	And if you missed all this action play out, sorry, the site's gone because it's just a
3822440	3823440	big white page now.
3823440	3827800	But what happened later in the week, Sony fessed up and said something to the effect
3827800	3833000	of blah, blah, blah, you caught us, blah, blah, blah, I guess we were too funky fresh
3833000	3837800	for you, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, continuing to make themselves look stupid.
3837800	3842920	Because the problem I think most people had with AllIWantForXmasisapsp.com is not necessarily
3842920	3846920	the fact that they were being lied to, because there's been previous viral marketing campaigns
3846920	3850720	that were kind of, you know, fun, like the I Love Bees and stuff like that, but the problem
3850720	3858800	with AllIWantForXmasisapsp.com is they made your typical gamer look like a dumbass.
3858800	3863780	I mean just a complete and utter, and like I seriously, like when I watched these videos
3863780	3869240	I felt my intelligence be insulted, like this is supposed to win me over, this is really
3869240	3871560	what marketing people think gamers are.
3871560	3876240	And for Sony to come out and say, I guess we were too funky fresh for you, that's like
3876240	3882820	when grandma says something about like, oh wow, that was really the bee's knees trying
3882820	3884040	to be cool like you.
3884040	3888800	I'm going like, you people really don't get it.
3888800	3894260	And the thing too about it is like they're all using, they had a bunch of fake comments
3894260	3899200	on there too by people saying, oh this is the best site ever, you know, and then like
3899200	3906880	using number two for every time they said two, and just trying to fake that late speaker
3906880	3913440	or whatever on their website, and why the fuck do they create a website, because other
3913440	3921400	than they get buzz and stuff about the PSP, but it's just, to create a fake website with
3921400	3925800	a bunch of people saying, oh the PSP is awesome and stuff like that, it's just really dirty,
3925800	3929960	I don't know, it just seems like, you know, I don't see Nintendo making fake websites
3929960	3934060	going, oh the Wii is awesome and stuff, you don't need that kind of, you don't need to
3934060	3939600	make up that publicity, you know, it's just the PSP and the PlayStation 3 have been having
3939600	3941400	a big problem with their marketing campaigns.
3941400	3945680	Alright, I got some comments from the chat room I have to read here, we have a, Crispy
3945680	3950080	says, least they fessed up, well you know what, I kind of feel like they had to fess
3950080	3954700	up, I mean seriously, Sony was caught with not only their pants down, but their boxers
3954700	3960480	down too, so the world could see what an incredibly tiny, tiny penis Sony had when it came to
3960480	3964860	the PSP, because seriously that's kind of what it boils down to right now, is that Sony
3964860	3969920	is probably a little pissed that people are all hyped about Wii and DS and da da da da
3969920	3976160	da, and that there wasn't a legitimate blog out there for PSP rabid fandom, so they created
3976160	3977160	this.
3977160	3980880	And let's see, Funny Dale in our chat room says, I hate to break the news to you guys,
3980880	3984800	but every video game commercial makes gamers look like a bunch of losers.
3984800	3987280	Eh, what Cris, you say that's not true?
3987280	3990840	That's not true, I don't get that, I don't get that when I see those.
3990840	3996000	It depends, again it depends on what commercial I'm looking at, like I kind of like the Wii
3996000	4000680	commercials, but then again the Wii appeals to those that are not gamers, so.
4000680	4001680	I think.
4001680	4002680	Yeah, I don't know.
4002680	4003680	Well let's look at.
4003680	4007800	I can see where he's getting that comment from though, it has taken the society a long
4007800	4009540	time to get gamers, you know what I mean?
4009540	4016400	I think it really, like the PlayStation commercials, for both the PSP and the PlayStation 3, I
4016400	4021440	never really got them, and I always knew that they had a problem with their marketing firms,
4021440	4025840	because look at the way they're advertised, like the PSP, they have two stick figures,
4025840	4031040	or not stick figures, but like, you know, sketch drawings of like dust bunnies or whatever,
4031040	4037340	like talking about random shit, you know, and they're all PSP, it's like nuts, it's
4037340	4041720	like you can play outside or something like that, it doesn't make any sense, nor do the
4041720	4046640	PlayStation 3 commercials, they're in the room with the PlayStation 3, you know, making
4046640	4051640	a baby doll cry, it makes no sense, it's like, what the fuck is this?
4051640	4057880	And it really, it doesn't show off what the games do, or what the system does, it's just
4057880	4063360	like this commercial that you talk about, but yet you don't know what it's about, whereas
4063360	4066820	they have like Call of Duty 3 or something that shows actual gameplay, or the Wii that
4066820	4071520	shows actual gameplay, just show me the games, show me the games!
4071520	4077560	Alright, Flaming Bozo in our chat room says, no, the commercials for gaming colleges make
4077560	4078560	us look stupid.
4078560	4079840	Oh, yeah, those are awful.
4079840	4083720	Okay, I get it, thank you for citing a commercial, you're right, that one does make gamers look
4083720	4087640	pretty stupid, but I think people need to get the concept of, and this is one of those
4087640	4090920	things I feel like, you know, at least in the Wii marketing, and again, I'm not talking
4090920	4093700	about the systems, I'm talking about the marketing, in the Wii marketing it's kind of got that
4093700	4101880	gamers are everybody, who enjoys movies, everybody, who listens to music, everybody, shouldn't
4101880	4105120	games be accessible to everybody too, right, kind of thing?
4105120	4106120	I don't know.
4106120	4107120	Definitely.
4107120	4108120	One would hope.
4108120	4110640	Anyway, real quick question, then we'll get to another story here, but I want to go around
4110640	4116960	the room and ask, yes or no, and any other thing you want to say, Sony should fire any
4116960	4121400	company related to their marketing right now and start with new companies around the board,
4121400	4124960	in other words, Sony should just axe everything to do with their marketing right now and start
4124960	4127840	anew in 2007, yes or no?
4127840	4132840	I think it would be a good idea to not only get new marketers, I mean, get some people
4132840	4137640	that actually know how to market this stuff, like the people behind Burger King, or even
4137640	4142000	like Geico, just like people that come up with really creative marketing campaigns,
4142000	4145760	great, that's great, get some of those people to help you out.
4145760	4150760	Also get your higher ups to shut the fuck up, because they keep ruining any good marketing
4150760	4155140	that you do for yourselves, so that's what they need to do, and also I think companies
4155140	4159440	have a really crazy idea what viral marketing is.
4159440	4163940	Jamie, yes or no, Sony needs to fire all their marketers.
4163940	4169020	To take this from a business point of view, that would actually be pretty damn illogical
4169020	4175820	to expect them to, because they have contracts set up with these, what they need to do is
4175820	4185580	have more express control, better QA with what goes on with what's marketed, more involvement
4185580	4191960	with this, let's look at this realistically, because honestly, anything that their marketing
4191960	4197080	firms come up with, doesn't Sony have to approve?
4197080	4203680	So somebody at Sony approved these, they need to find whoever was in charge of approving
4203680	4206120	it and fire them.
4206120	4214480	Or structural reorganization, we don't like to talk about people getting killed or fired
4214480	4216840	or anything, but structural reorganization is a need.
4216840	4219280	Or hire me.
4219280	4220280	Would you save Sony?
4220280	4222600	I am brilliant, I would save Sony's ass.
4222600	4227600	Oh God, no, I'm sorry, I love you Jamie, but damn, it would be like PlayStation 3 starts
4227600	4229400	fires, fire, fire, fire.
4229400	4234640	No, no, no, no, it would be PlayStation 3 presented by Sega.
4234640	4241480	Here's what they really need to do, and they really need to just focus on what makes them
4241480	4243620	good, what makes the system good.
4243620	4250200	It plays games, it's great for gaming and stuff, maybe show off the 6 axis controller
4250200	4255480	and how it's used in games and stuff like that, maybe just focus on what the system
4255480	4260200	offers, instead of just these really cryptic fucking commercials.
4260200	4263560	Also the PSP, they need to fucking get some good marketing behind this thing because right
4263560	4268960	now, they were hoping Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops was good, it was like a system seller,
4268960	4273160	but I don't think anyone really knows what's a good game on the PSP.
4273160	4276160	Well maybe word needs to get out there that maybe it's Metal Gear, and we're trying not
4276160	4279640	to be like a Sony hate fest, I don't know, maybe some of you guys are, I don't want to
4279640	4284120	see this be like a total Sony hate fest because like I said, I love Luminous 2, there are
4284120	4290080	good things I like about the PSP, it's just that boy, your marketing sucks right now.
4290080	4293680	Some of their commercials and print materials have been decent, and so if I were to answer
4293680	4299320	this question, I'd say whoever was behind this whole thing, definitely structural reorganization,
4299320	4302400	but when it comes to, some of their marketing hasn't been bad.
4302400	4305920	What happened to the really cool marketing that they had at E3, like the Play Beyond
4305920	4306920	stuff?
4306920	4310280	That stuff was cool, they should have stuck with that, but see, my marketing scheme for
4310280	4314440	the PlayStation 3 would start off with fire in the commercial.
4314440	4323200	Okay, you know what, Sony needs to hire Jamie to be their Major Nelson, it's Sergeant Sakura.
4323200	4329000	It would start off with fire, and then there would be some more explosions in the background,
4329000	4335600	and then, this Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, your PlayStation 3 will be on fire!
4335600	4342920	No, no, no, no, no, there'd be a fence somewhere in the background, like a chain link fence,
4342920	4347840	and there'd be all these really awesome people walking around with PlayStation 3s, and then
4347840	4351040	the announcer going, buy a PlayStation 3, dammit!
4351040	4357720	Alright, I gotta let Chris comment on this being the one who maybe isn't as into consoles
4357720	4362440	as the rest of us, Sony needs to fire them all, yes or no?
4362440	4366120	Well, realistically, we all know they're not going to, because like somebody said, I think
4366120	4372840	it was Jamie, they got contracts, um, I don't think they should get fired, but someone definitely
4372840	4377880	needs to go, I nominate Jamie for this, someone needs to go in there and like bitch slap them,
4377880	4379480	because I think what they're doing is-
4379480	4380480	Gladly!
4380480	4381480	Yeah, I know.
4381480	4385840	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm reading chat room and these comments are too good to pass up,
4385840	4387240	hold on, let Chris finish your thought.
4387240	4388800	Yeah, the chat room upped me, it's okay.
4388800	4389800	No, I'm sorry, finish your thought.
4389800	4390800	No, no, no, go, go, go, quick!
4390800	4396800	Okay, Fireboma has an idea for a campaign, and that is a PlayStation 3 campaign would
4396800	4402640	go something like this, only faggots buy a Wii.
4402640	4407480	And look, look, I am gay, so I can laugh at that, that is kind of funny, I'm sorry.
4407480	4411240	If you buy a Wii, that means you like it in the ass.
4411240	4416720	Xbox, this would be the other commercial, Xbox 360 owners are fat and retarded, you aren't
4416720	4422520	fat and retarded, are you?
4422520	4425560	There it is, Sergeant Fireboma, everybody.
4425560	4430000	If you have the Wii 60, does it mean that you're a big fat dyke?
4430000	4431560	You know, and honestly, even though-
4431560	4433840	That means you like fried chicken, and-
4433840	4438040	And even though that is so offensive, I would still think that's a better advertisement,
4438040	4439120	I would laugh at that.
4439120	4444160	I know, I would at least laugh at that, like if I saw a commercial come on TV, like you
4444160	4448640	think I should be offended, you know, being gay and all, but I would probably laugh, like
4448640	4453200	I'd be all, that's better than the all I want for xmas is a BSP thing.
4453200	4455200	I'm laughing so hard, that's great.
4455200	4456200	Okay-
4456200	4457880	I'm just thinking of the hate mail that's gonna come in.
4457880	4459440	New ad scheme, new ad scheme.
4459440	4462120	You guys should not be using those words on the internet.
4462120	4463120	So what?
4463120	4465520	We have a mature rating, so-
4465520	4466840	I know, whatever, whatever.
4466840	4472140	No, the ad scheme would be this, is you just have a black screen, yeah?
4472140	4478680	And the Playstation 3 shows up, it's like, you want one, we're Sony, kiss our ass!
4478680	4482000	No, no, no, I got one, I got one, I got one, I got one, I got one, I got one, I got one.
4482000	4484200	Buy a Playstation 3 or we will kill you!
4484200	4487040	Okay, hold on, alright, we're getting too crazy here, hold on.
4487040	4489600	I'm gonna put a call out to the listeners.
4489600	4491680	We have a voicemail system, right?
4491680	4495600	This is what I would know, this is a homework assignment, and we'll even turn this into
4495600	4496600	a giveaway.
4496600	4498160	This is it.
4498160	4501760	We want you to leave a voicemail, not now, if you're listening live to us on Sunday,
4501760	4506320	please don't call now, but call after, you know, when the podcast feed hits, call.
4506320	4510760	Leave your best 30-second Sony commercial, okay?
4510760	4516200	The winner, the one that persuades us to buy a Sony product the most, we will send something
4516200	4520480	from our prize pool somewhere, so we'll dig something up, I don't know, so-
4520480	4522240	Get the paper from Rob's bathroom.
4522240	4529760	Alright, so anyway, alright, so get to it, leave your 30-second voicemails, and we'll
4529760	4534440	play our favorites when we come back live here on Orange Launch Radio.
4534440	4536640	Alright, we gotta get to more news.
4536640	4537640	Where the hell were we?
4537640	4538640	Dude, my turn!
4538640	4539640	Moving on.
4539640	4541480	No, no, Loki had one thing real quick, I think.
4541480	4542480	Well, too bad.
4542480	4543480	Yes, my turn.
4543480	4544480	Okay.
4544480	4548200	So anyways, speaking of this viral marketing, because we kind of derailed that whole train
4548200	4553640	there in a second, the Federal Trade Commission actually on Monday said that the companies
4553640	4559640	would be required to disclose ties of word-of-mouth marketing campaigns, these fake grassroots
4559640	4565640	efforts dubbed astro-surfing by critics, hire people to endorse products as themselves rather
4565640	4569440	than respective companies.
4569440	4573680	So actually it's pretty cool that they're doing this, and I do think it's something,
4573680	4578360	because I always see when they're advertising different games and stuff, all these viral
4578360	4583380	marketing campaigns, and really, I don't think people know what viral marketing is.
4583380	4588060	You're not supposed to know that you're being marketed to, not by saying, look, I'm a site
4588060	4594740	called I love such-and-such game or something, I love Barbie Horse Adventures, and having
4594740	4596840	a bunch of people saying, yeah, that game rocks.
4596840	4598140	That's not viral marketing.
4598140	4600600	That is basically lying to people.
4600600	4605420	A viral marketing campaign is saying, Barbie's saying, oh, come try out my new horse game,
4605420	4607400	get an email like that or something.
4607400	4610360	That is a little bit different.
4610360	4611640	But basically they need to...
4611640	4613160	I want to get emails from Barbie.
4613160	4615640	Where do I sign up for that?
4615640	4617760	Be a dirty whore.
4617760	4620320	Or alternate reality gaming.
4620320	4624720	That's another good marketing campaign, because it gets people involved and it's kind of some
4624720	4628400	mystery to it, and I don't know, I think it's a really good way to do that.
4628400	4638320	I Love Bees, the whole Xbox 360 campaign that they did, the Hex 168 or whatever it was,
4638320	4642720	that's good marketing, but I guess when you have retarded marketing companies working
4642720	4644600	for you, that's all they can come up with.
4644600	4648720	By the way, I forgot to give you the voicemail number, speaking of a good lapse of judgment,
4648720	4649720	1-877-GAME-OLR.
4649720	4652240	That's toll free in the US and Canada.
4652240	4656600	Sorry UK listeners, you'd have to pay, but you could do it the free way if you use Skype.
4656600	4660440	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, you can just give us a call there, download
4660440	4661440	the program.
4661440	4662880	More information on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4662880	4663880	Click on interact with us.
4663880	4665760	Hey, I thought of another idea.
4665760	4666880	What's that?
4666880	4667880	Ad campaign.
4667880	4669200	Going back to that.
4669200	4670200	Okay.
4670200	4672840	A giant crab comes out clutching a PlayStation 3.
4672840	4676720	I would laugh at that, that would be awesome.
4676720	4681280	And the slogan is, buy a PS3, get crabs.
4681280	4685640	I think if Sony could laugh at themselves like that, they'd earn a lot of respect back
4685640	4686640	in this community.
4686640	4690240	If they could point and laugh at themselves like that, parade that guy back out there
4690240	4694440	who said that giant enemy crab thing the first time, make a big joke of it.
4694440	4699160	You know what, I think the gaming culture would kind of laugh at that and forgive them
4699160	4700160	a little bit.
4700160	4702880	Rob, give the number out again, please.
4702880	4705600	Yes, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
4705600	4706920	You're welcome, chat room.
4706920	4707920	All right.
4707920	4709200	So hey, my turn, right?
4709200	4711120	Sure, yes, now you can go.
4711120	4712120	Okay.
4712120	4720400	Well, speaking of the PlayStation 3, buy our crabs, they put out the 1.31 update, which
4720400	4726360	adds support for Final Fantasy XI for all you weird addicts.
4726360	4730880	The update on the US page does not state what is involved in it, but however the Japanese
4730880	4741520	site does, and based on a rudimentary translation, it's the installation of the hard disk PlayStation
4741520	4748280	2, so basically the hard drive attachment is going to be compatible.
4748280	4754880	So that means you get Nobunaga's Ambition online on Final Fantasy XI.
4754880	4759680	Now they're saying that it's not quite working on the Japanese site for the PlayStation 2
4759680	4765520	system data, but the speculation is that you may need to actually have the games it goes
4765520	4766520	with to do the download.
4766520	4770680	So that's kind of neat that all you'll have to do is download some stuff to your hard
4770680	4772560	drive and it'll work?
4772560	4773560	That's the theory.
4773560	4777920	So maybe I can play my BeatMania.
4777920	4782400	My question would be, though, would you really want to play this game on the PlayStation
4782400	4787840	3, because I don't know if you guys have seen this video on Dig this week, it hit Dig and
4787840	4791920	it was all over the internet, but some guy actually made a side-by-side comparison of
4791920	4798000	playing Final Fantasy X on the PlayStation 2 and on the PlayStation 3, and honestly,
4798000	4801840	it looks like absolute horseshit on the PlayStation 3.
4801840	4804880	And they show you what the PS3 one looks like, I'm playing it in the studio here.
4804880	4807760	You can see the PS3 is on one side of the screen and the PS2 is on the other side of
4807760	4808760	the screen.
4808760	4811400	Let me go to a section here that has a face, and you can really tell the difference.
4811400	4816800	You can see how the PS3 one is kind of faded out, it looks a little washed, and you can
4816800	4820560	see, especially when they get into the shots, see, look at the shots of Yuna's face here.
4820560	4825160	You can see all these jaggedies there, you can see all this stuff.
4825160	4832320	The one thing in defense of the PlayStation 3 side is the colors seem a bit more normalized,
4832320	4833720	not overcontrasted.
4833720	4834720	Right.
4834720	4838740	So, anyway, what basically is going on here is that they're saying this could be really
4838740	4844120	fixed with just a simple firmware update, honestly, that's all they really had to do
4844120	4847440	to get rid of the jaggedies and the artifacts that are there, but nothing yet.
4847440	4850680	I guess it was one of those things that was overlooked to get the system out on time.
4850680	4858840	Well, I do think, I'd have to see other games to compare it, honestly, but I do like, some
4858840	4864120	of the backgrounds looked more washed out, but I think for skin tones, it was clearer,
4864120	4867200	the skin tones were more realistic and accurate.
4867200	4868200	Interesting.
4868200	4869760	That's what forgiving the most of the internet was.
4869760	4874080	Well, then again, I'm taking it from an artist's point of view, there are more jaggedies.
4874080	4877840	Well, let's also, you know, it's YouTube, it's not going to be the best quality, but
4877840	4882480	look, you got a PS3, you should go home and try for yourself and let us know.
4882480	4885480	You want to borrow my Final Fantasy X?
4885480	4888040	I have Final Fantasy X!
4888040	4889600	I just went checking.
4889600	4894440	God, Rob, no, but no, seriously though, you know, actually that would be good because
4894440	4898080	if I, all I have to do is switch my channels, you know, we actually did that, Dan and I
4898080	4902800	did that a long time ago, with our Saturn and the Playstation for Castlevania Symphony
4902800	4904200	of the Night.
4904200	4905200	Interesting.
4905200	4910280	It turned out that the Saturn version had better sound, and the 2D effects were better,
4910280	4913640	but the Playstation had better 3D, so that was our comparison.
4913640	4916200	I could do that again, try it with other games.
4916200	4917200	That might be kind of fun.
4917200	4920680	Yeah, I'd have to find duplicates of some of the games, but I could do that.
4920680	4923440	Oops, sorry, I keep playing the video there in the background, I was trying to get the
4923440	4929800	link there for chat because they do this little, like, unnecessary intro to the thing on YouTube,
4929800	4930800	but whatever.
4930800	4935520	Anyway, there, oh, dammit, I reposted the hamster thing in chat.
4935520	4937720	Son of a bitch.
4937720	4938720	Hamsters?
4938720	4939720	Go hamster!
4939720	4946120	Damn it, YouTube, let me make sure that copied.
4946120	4951680	This is great radio, boys and girls, what can we say, we are taping live and this is
4951680	4952680	what happens.
4952680	4954680	There was a ton of time, there was a final fan in the game.
4954680	4955680	Ah, shut up.
4955680	4956680	What?
4956680	4957680	No.
4957680	4958680	Let's try that again.
4958680	4960680	There it is, there's the link the chat room's been begging for.
4960680	4962000	Oh, god.
4962000	4963000	Alright.
4963000	4964800	Please, let's move on.
4964800	4969600	Hey, ShadowCharlie has also pointed out that you can play as Maria in the Saturn version,
4969600	4973080	but you can also play as Richter and he's not an easy kill in that one.
4973080	4977600	And, Dan just unlocked Richter and Maria mode in, um, Portrait of Ruin.
4977600	4978600	Really?
4978600	4980000	And it's, like, TurboGrafx Maria.
4980000	4981000	Huh.
4981000	4982000	It's pretty cool.
4982000	4983000	I'll say that.
4983000	4984000	I'll say that.
4984000	4985000	Anyways.
4985000	4989800	Um, so, you know, it's awesome that you get to play as, um, or play Final Fantasy XI on
4989800	4990880	your Playstation 3.
4990880	4994920	Unfortunately, you can't do that if you're in the UK because it's not out yet.
4994920	4998920	And the speculation is, it might not be out for quite a while.
4998920	5003240	And there might actually be a delay on the March, um, date.
5003240	5007240	And they're saying that it's possibly delayed to May, if not September.
5007240	5014760	Um, according to, uh, let's see, Computer and Video Games, that website.
5014760	5018440	Um, so, what did Sony have to say about this?
5018440	5026160	Well, actually, um, Sony's Computer Entertainment Europe, David Reeves, he said, uh, well, we're
5026160	5030600	still on schedule with the launch, um, for the Playstation 3 in March, throughout the
5030600	5036000	PAL territories, and all speculation otherwise is without foundation.
5036000	5041720	Um, it should be noted, though, this is the same guy that was saying, um, that they're
5041720	5049840	on track for releasing, actually, in 2006, Spring, um, he says that they were on track
5049840	5050840	at that time.
5050840	5059000	I'm basically also saying that, um, I don't know, but it's pretty funny, though, uh, you
5059000	5064600	know, this guy is basically just giving people the assumption that the thing was coming out
5064600	5070520	in Spring of 2006, and then when it passed that date, they saw, oh, by the way, it's
5070520	5075800	not coming out at that time, so who knows if it's coming out in March, and by the, looking
5075800	5079040	at how many units they're producing, supposedly they're done with the bottleneck with the
5079040	5084920	Blu-ray, um, diodes, but if that's not the case, it might not be coming out.
5084920	5088680	I don't see why the UK won't be getting us on time, I'm sorry, but this guy's word isn't
5088680	5090160	enough for me.
5090160	5091160	Sorry.
5091160	5094760	My, my thing would be, is they're gonna get it in March, but it's definitely not gonna
5094760	5095760	be as major.
5095760	5096760	It's gonna be like our launch.
5096760	5097760	Yeah.
5097760	5098760	Yeah.
5098760	5102200	Have fun, our friends over the UK who are gonna be waiting for this system.
5102200	5106560	Alright, one thing I know you guys look forward to every week is DarkSakura's website of the
5106560	5110440	week, because she surfs the internet up and down, and up, up, down, down, left, right,
5110440	5115480	left, right, all over the internet, to, uh, whatever, to find a website just for you,
5115480	5120520	it's her website of the week, and here it is, boys and girls, DarkSakura, take it away.
5120520	5127040	My website of the week is a fun one, actually, it's earthcam.com, because I love looking
5127040	5133440	at different webcams all over the world, and, no seriously, you can look at, you know, London,
5133440	5140520	Moscow, Japan, you know, anywhere, it's basically different, um, webcams in different locations
5140520	5141520	across the world.
5141520	5142520	That's kinda cool.
5142520	5143520	I think it's really cool.
5143520	5146360	Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna check that out, because one thing I've been playing with a
5146360	5149960	lot this week is Google Earth, which is one of my favorite programs ever, it lets you
5149960	5154300	look at satellite photography and zoom in and out, anywhere in the world, anywhere.
5154300	5159240	One of the ones I'm looking at right now is in Meppen, Germany, um, that's of an ice skating
5159240	5161240	rink.
5161240	5164720	I think that's very cool, but it's just basically linked to different international webcams.
5164720	5169200	There's actually a webcam, I hope that they've got it back up, but it was in, uh, New Orleans
5169200	5173620	in the French Quarter, they used to have a cam outside one of the, uh, the bars.
5173620	5174620	You know what's funny?
5174620	5178200	My friend was on that cam once and sent a picture from it, this was years ago, before
5178200	5180200	you know all the disaster.
5180200	5181200	Yeah.
5181200	5182200	Isn't that funny?
5182200	5188200	And, um, but some of the other places listed here, there's one, um, in, um, Erfurt, Germany,
5188200	5196680	and, um, a few in Russia, one in Weatherford, Texas, uh, Peak District, England, Jerusalem,
5196680	5197880	Miami.
5197880	5198880	It's really cool.
5198880	5204760	I think it's very neat, and it's sort of, you know, I don't think there's any in any
5204760	5205760	bathrooms.
5205760	5207960	No, no locker room webcams, Chris, sorry.
5207960	5213480	But, but I think it's a very, a very good idea, another way to, to bring us, you know,
5213480	5214480	sort of closer.
5214480	5219900	Uh, GS68 in our chatroom says, we need an OLR webcam, and I'll tell you guys, uh, it
5219900	5224120	actually looks like it probably will happen if you're all good boys and girls for Christmas.
5224120	5227880	Uh, there will be a cam coming back to the show in 2007, that's all I can say for now.
5227880	5230840	I'll be doing the Dance of the Seven Veils in the background.
5230840	5231840	Jamie doesn't like to be it.
5231840	5232840	As in sitting in a chair.
5232840	5233840	Jamie doesn't like to be seen.
5233840	5237560	But we're trying to, the problem is, the studio we're in now is a lot smaller than any place
5237560	5238560	we were before.
5238560	5240360	There's a lot less people and weird stuff going on.
5240360	5243860	When I say studio, I mean spare bedroom, as opposed to the living room at Loki and I's
5243860	5244860	old apartment.
5244860	5245860	Now we're in a spare bedroom.
5245860	5249840	So it's, um, kind of tough for us to situate a webcam here where you can actually see everything.
5249840	5253280	But I'm thinking I know a good place where you can put a cam where you can see most of
5253280	5254280	the action.
5254280	5255280	So we'll see.
5255280	5256280	You have a beautiful self.
5256280	5259680	When, when you show up, which you need to show up more often, miss, miss things.
5259680	5262680	I'm coming up from the South Bay, I come up as often as I can.
5262680	5263680	All right.
5263680	5264680	We appreciate it.
5264680	5265680	All right.
5265680	5268040	Thank you, boys and girls, Stark Sakura.
5268040	5269040	Give it up.
5269040	5270160	All right.
5270160	5271160	Let's go to some more news.
5271160	5275100	It's kind of in other types of game news, not about games themselves, but an interesting
5275100	5282400	program going on in Oakland, the SF Gate newspaper, or, I'm sorry, is this a newspaper or just
5282400	5283400	a website?
5283400	5287680	Or, I believe it's like an alternative press style thing.
5287680	5293200	The SF Gate is mentioning that you can go to Fruitvale Elementary School in Oakland,
5293200	5298120	where the war against improper toys drive is going on.
5298120	5304760	What is happening is that they will, what you can do, you can take your replica shotguns,
5304760	5311760	rifles, pistols, whatever, and you can trade them in for books and family friendly toys.
5311760	5316440	Now how this plays out is that you can also take your violent video games.
5316440	5319340	You want to get rid of, you know, Gears of War.
5319340	5323040	You want to get rid of, you know, any of those, you know, shoot them up to style games.
5323040	5327640	You can actually trade this in as well.
5327640	5328640	What's that?
5328640	5330280	What about my Jeff Striker action figure?
5330280	5333680	I dare you to take it to the school and find out.
5333680	5336060	If you do, please tape it so we can YouTube it.
5336060	5339080	That's all I'm going to say.
5339080	5343080	That address, by the way, 3200 Boston Avenue in Oakland.
5343080	5344560	That's right by 580.
5344560	5348960	Are they going to send all these improper toys to the island of misfit toys by chance?
5348960	5354760	They need the island of misfit sex toys.
5354760	5357080	Not said what they're going to do with it.
5357080	5358080	Sorry.
5358080	5361480	They're going to burn it in effigy.
5361480	5364400	So, anyways, this is actually pretty interesting.
5364400	5371060	Speaking of games and stuff, improper, Capcom's revamping their multiplayer.
5371060	5375320	We actually ran a story, was it last week, where they were fixing the small text issues.
5375320	5381280	Well now they're kind of going off of some more of their user feedback and fixing the
5381280	5387680	multiplayer including some of the lobbies and matchmaking and stuff like that.
5387680	5393800	So I'm glad to see a company actually listening to the complaints and maybe suggestions from
5393800	5398560	their users so that in turn, you know, they create a better product.
5398560	5399560	So that's excellent.
5399560	5400560	Cannot wait.
5400560	5405960	It's going to be probably one of the only good 360 games coming out in January.
5405960	5411520	Has anybody ever heard of the GP32X, sorry, the GP2X?
5411520	5412520	Yes.
5412520	5413520	Okay.
5413520	5418160	Well basically this one is- Okay, no, I haven't.
5418160	5422120	What this is, it's a Linux-based handheld console.
5422120	5425440	It's for movies, games, music.
5425440	5429800	You can develop and run your own software, run MAME on it.
5429800	5434160	It's supposed to be pretty versatile, well it's actually getting its first major game.
5434160	5440120	It's getting a game called Payback, which is a crime caper game that was originally
5440120	5444780	on the Game Boy Advance in 2004.
5444780	5450320	It's a top-down action, 11 cities, 50 missions, updated 3D graphics, sound special effects,
5450320	5453640	custom jukebox mode so you can put your own soundtrack on it.
5453640	5458400	And it'll actually- Now again, this is for the UK.
5458400	5462480	It's going to be £22.99.
5462480	5467680	Think Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2, that type of game.
5467680	5468680	Huh.
5468680	5469680	Interesting.
5469680	5472760	I did not remember, I think this handheld was talked about on an earlier show but I
5472760	5473760	kind of forgot about it.
5473760	5477120	Well it's interesting they have a Linux handheld because it's funny because they try to put
5477120	5478960	Linux on all the other handhelds.
5478960	5479960	And the toaster.
5479960	5482760	So it's kind of humorous to me to hear about a Linux handheld.
5482760	5483760	I don't know why.
5483760	5484760	I think it's a good idea.
5484760	5486440	I'd actually love to get my hands on that.
5486440	5489280	Yeah, I mean I would like to see the presence of this increase.
5489280	5498960	Well if anyone wants to see the website on this game, go to gp2x.co.uk slash payback.html.
5498960	5503640	It's got a movie file up on there, a bit more about the game, it has some stuff on the system.
5503640	5509560	Yeah, actually I remember seeing the system at E3 a couple years back.
5509560	5511560	This is pretty cool.
5511560	5515120	Linux is the- Their logo is like a penguin, right?
5515120	5516120	Yes.
5516120	5518360	I saw that on someone's license plate.
5518360	5520640	Like it was actually part of the license plate.
5520640	5522560	There's some hardcore nerds out there.
5522560	5529000	We have a neighbor here that has a license plate that says Z-O-M-G hack.
5529000	5530200	And I want to know who that is.
5530200	5534480	We live in this huge complex and there's some guy with a license plate there and I'm always
5534480	5536800	like, wow, it's another nerd.
5536800	5538400	Someone had that said noob on it.
5538400	5539400	That was pretty funny.
5539400	5540400	That's cool.
5540400	5549080	Just to give a little bit more about the system, by the way, it has a 200 megahertz CPU, 64
5549080	5554080	megahertz RAM, custom graphics hardware decoding chips, takes SD cards, has 64 megahertz of
5554080	5558160	a NAND memory.
5558160	5561480	It basically, you don't have to re-encode any of your movies that you put on it.
5561480	5563720	It'll play anything directly like on the computer.
5563720	5566780	Price on it is 124 pounds 99, so.
5566780	5568360	And a partridge in a pear tree.
5568360	5569360	I want one.
5569360	5570360	I have everything else.
5570360	5572800	Why don't I have one of these?
5572800	5573800	You should go get one.
5573800	5574800	Ask Santa.
5574800	5575800	Maybe he'll bring you one.
5575800	5578760	Dear UK friends, send me one for Christmas.
5578760	5580480	I love you forever.
5580480	5582800	eBay, the gamer's shopping place.
5582800	5584080	Yeah, eBay, seriously.
5584080	5590160	Anyways, so last week we talked a little bit about Interlink's lawsuit with Nintendo over
5590160	5595700	the Wii remote and basically saying that it's infringing on their patents for a trigger-operated
5595700	5597080	electronic device.
5597080	5600640	What's interesting, though, is that we've kind of figured that the whole lawsuit was
5600640	5606160	about the fact that it's like a Wii-mote type thing, something motion-sensitive, but it's
5606160	5611260	actually just for the stupid trigger on the bottom of the Wii-mote, which I don't know
5611260	5616160	about you, but I think there's been remotes with triggers on the bottom of them way before
5616160	5621200	this whole patent thing came to play, so it's going to be interesting to see how that actually
5621200	5623120	plays out in court.
5623120	5625960	Doesn't technically the Xbox 360 controller have a trigger on the bottom of it?
5625960	5630600	It does have a trigger on the bottom of it, and what about the Nintendo 64 controller
5630600	5636960	has a trigger on the bottom of it, and the PlayStation 2 has a trigger on the actual
5636960	5638080	controller?
5638080	5642480	I don't think they're going to get very far with this, to be honest, but they're going
5642480	5643480	to try.
5643480	5648040	Well, we will see, and we'll follow up in a future episode, and that would bring to
5648040	5650080	a close this part of Orange Launch Radio.
5650080	5653340	It's been a long week, but it's been busy, busy news week, lots of news, and there's
5653340	5657320	plenty more to come in Part B. We haven't even gotten really, we've only scratched the
5657320	5659880	surface on the whole Wii strap fiasco.
5659880	5662040	We've barely had any Nintendo news this segment.
5662040	5666760	We've got a ton of it coming up next in Orange Launch Radio Part B, so please stay tuned.
5666760	5668320	We'll see you back here for Part B.
5668320	5673020	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
5673020	5674020	a week.
