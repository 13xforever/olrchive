00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're the hosts, Bart Sakura, Sky, and Moto.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, December 10th, 2006.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Microsoft gets sued over brick 360s, the old Apple entering the console market rumor resurfaces,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and is the Playstation 3 harming the acceptance of Blu-ray?

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We are that video game program dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts and unfortunately not joining us this week is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But we do have the ferret to speak for her in her plays.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
She's actually in L.A. this week. She's spinning around on the teacups back at Disneyland.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I know, again? She's at Disneyland again?

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, she's there with Chris and oh well.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
She's not here this week.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
She was going to call in with a special report, but I guess she got too dizzy because I didn't see anything on the Skype line.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So, maybe she'll bug us later. I don't know.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But in the meantime, the one and only Loki is joining us here tonight.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes, I am.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Alright, how you doing?

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm doing okay.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Alright. It's kind of weird because we haven't been live in a while.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Like, since before Thanksgiving.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You know, we missed that show Thanksgiving week and then we were pre-taped last week.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And now, this week, it doesn't feel like a full thing because it's just you and me and there's no Dark Sakura.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There's no special guests yet, although supposedly Miklotov's going to be here.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But, like, an hour before we went live, they were like,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Bye! We're going to go play DDR at the bowling alley. And I'm like, dude, I've been wanting to go check out the machine for like three weeks.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What machine?

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
There's supposedly a DDR Supernova at the bowling alley at Country Club.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
At the Ultra Ghetto Club?

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, I hear Keys. They might be back now. I don't know. We'll see.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, in the meanwhile, while we figure out what's going on there, we'll start off the show how we always do it with a little bit of

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How was your gaming week? Loki, how was your gaming week?

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My gaming week is okay. I actually tried out Viva Pinata and I played it for about half an hour.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Until which the game decided I don't want to play it anymore.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Which is ironic because I really didn't want to play it anymore because, well, it froze up on me.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And the game itself was just very kind of boring.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I mean, I got really bored with it really quick, so I plan on selling it back since I didn't pay for it in the first place.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So, I don't know. Can't recommend it, but I guess if you stick with it long enough it might be fun.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I just found it very, very, very annoying.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So, whatever.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Played more Excite Truck because that's fun. Played more Wii Sports.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We've been doing more of the Wii Sports bowling.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And my friend who's, you know, used to be in a bowling league was kicking our ass.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So, whatever.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then, I don't know, just waiting for Elibits this week and actually I'm going to probably try to pick up Far Cry Vengeance as well.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So, those would be fun.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And, you know, more Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And, I don't know. That's pretty much it.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I know, was it, on Tuesday actually I'm going to be hooking up the Wii in our kind of giant theater at work that we have.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
For a demonstration for all the sales staff.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And it's going to be kind of cool because we get to use my wireless sensor bar that I made.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So, I'm going to be playing the Wii on a giant screen.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I actually tried it out on Friday and it worked out pretty good.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So, looking forward to that.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But, in the meantime, just kind of kicking back and waiting for some better games to come out.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And, from the looks of things, it's going to be a little bit before some good stuff comes out.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I do have a real quick story though that's unrelated to games slightly.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh, sure. Why not?

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We went go-kart racing today.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And I'm not talking about the crappy go-karts at Golf Land, but actual indoor go-kart tracks.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You know, the karts that go up to about 40 miles an hour and type stuff.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Is that that little place right up here?

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I've always wanted to go there.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Other than the fact that it hurts the hell out of my hands driving those things because there's no power steering on them, of course.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I was able to successfully drift at 40 miles an hour thanks to video games because of how I learned to drift in Ridge Racer.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The same logic applies and I was able to drift around corners pretty quick.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And that's pretty awesome.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, you can learn something from games.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What was the reason that you decided to go to RPM today?

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
My dad's birthday. We took him down there.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What made him decide to do RPM of all places?

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He likes race cars.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He likes to drag cars and everything.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So, we thought it would be fun to go down there because I've never been down there.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
My sister asked. She actually goes down there quite a bit. She has a membership and stuff.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So, I got a membership.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's kind of cool though because you have to suit up and like the whole jumpsuit and the helmet and everything.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And there's people there that they have memberships.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
They buy their own helmets.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They have their own jumpsuits, their own racing gloves.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And it's just crazy.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But it's pretty fun.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They time your laps and everything.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And you're basically racing against the clock.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It sucks that the second car I got, because it's kind of like QZAR in a sense,

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
the second car I got really sucked and the tires were all fucked up on it.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So, it wouldn't grip it.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I kept spinning it out and hitting the wall.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And I don't know. It was fun though.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Can you imagine what Loki must be like at one of these places?

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes, that's right. The music's starting.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And it's like, oh, it's like initial D.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
D! Ready, set, go!

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Everything I need to know here I learned from initial D!

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Mega Drift!

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Damn, I left my little stupid Sega card at home. What am I going to do?

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It was fun though. I mean, really, we should go do it.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Like this show.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I think it would be fun. I think that's something we should put on YouTube.

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We could too, because you could film it.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Only if we get loaded before we go.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't drink and drive, kids. We're only kidding.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But I thought I'd mention that though.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, and I played a bit of Motorstorm at Kiosk at Best Buy.

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And I like it. I think it's kind of cool.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But it's a lot slower though than Excite Truck.

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
To be honest, I really wish that EA would do a Burnout off-road series.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You know what Motorstorm did for me?

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, this game sucks!

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That was Motorstorm.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's it. I played it at Target.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hi, Miklotov! You decided to join us after all.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah, we just got back from the bowling alley. How's my mic?

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I think you're okay. I might have to turn you up a little bit.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But how are you doing?

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm tired now.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So you guys want to go play the new DDR without me?

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, not the new, new DDR.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The newest DDR.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The newest DDR to us in Sacramento. How was it?

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, I didn't realize how stupid I am when I make steps sometimes.

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, that's right, because you do steps for the game.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, and we had to redo some steps a while ago for the UltraMix 1 songs.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Like, I played Gorgeous 2012 on doubles and I played heavy.

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't know if many people realize, but it has new heavy steps.

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And so I was playing and I was like, oh, yeah, I remember making these. These are fun.

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And then it got to utter crap. I was like, what was I thinking?

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And then I just gave up and died.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Was there a large crowd there playing DDR?

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If me and Irene are a large crowd, then yeah, there was a very large crowd.

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
All right, I'm trying to fix your mic here. How else was your gaming week?

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I played more Elite Beat Agents, trying to S everything on hard rock.

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Wow, I can hear myself.

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're supposed to be able to.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
OK, yeah, I played Elite Beat Agents.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I started playing Zelda again, and the fourth dungeon boss is the best boss fight I've ever played in my life.

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It was so cool.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And I don't think I did anything else besides that.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So it's just been Zelda all week long?

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No, because I don't play video games anymore.

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I hope you've been playing PSP and DS and all that stuff.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
PSP? When did I say I played PSP?

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Or DS. I'm fine, DS.

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Elite Beat Agents.

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's it?

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's my favorite game that I have on DS called Elite Beat Agents.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Say hello as well to someone else who's here.

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Say hello to Rice Princess.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
God, we haven't seen you in forever.

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, it's been a while.

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
How was your gaming week? What have you been playing?

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Nothing.

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Elite Beat Agents.

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You've got to get real close to the mic. These mics are not very sensitive.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What have you been playing?

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Can you take a guess?

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I can.

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What is it, Jay?

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It rhymes with ka-wow.

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You'd be right.

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It rhymes with World of BoarCraft.

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah, shut up.

167
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That would be W.A.B.

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Are you saying the World of BoarCraft?

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes, you are World of BoarCraft.

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What server are you on? What character class are you?

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What are you doing in the W.A.B.?

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm on Elder Thallus and I BVB.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
All day long?

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
All day long.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
All right.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yep.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Well, have fun with your W.A.B.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll do that.

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
All right.

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Chirp, chirp, chirp.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
My gaming week, not a whole lot of new stuff.

183
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I decided to go back and rediscover GameTap because I haven't been playing it a lot lately,

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and so I decided to load that up, and they actually have some cool new stuff on there

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
because they have the Castlevania games and Contra games from the old school 8-bit NES

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
are on there, and Silent Hill 2 is on GameTap, which it looks very nice.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I was very surprised.

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It looks better than it does on PS2 because it uses the advanced hardware on the computer

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to give the smoother textures and things.

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I was very, very pleased with that, and you can really control the resolution and everything,

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
so that was really cool.

192
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And Civilization III.

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
For those who have listened to the show in the past, you guys know I love Civilization.

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's my favorite PC game of all time.

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yet, Civilization II was such a shock to me that I just wrote off the series altogether.

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I had played Colonization, which was kind of cool, but I wrote off the series with Civilization II

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
because I'm like, this is too much.

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So I never did play Civ III or Civ IV.

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I never spent the money on it, but I went back and played Civ III, and it's not bad.

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I like it a little more than Civ II.

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It seems to be a little bit truer to the original than Civ II was, so I'm kind of liking it.

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm going to go play it some more.

203
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Good times.

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Maybe I'll have to play some OLR listeners, because it's multiple.

205
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Although, I don't even know anyone else with GameTap besides our webmaster, VX JasonXV.

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm still waiting for Myst Online to come out on there.

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I have not played the Sam & Max game yet, though.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I will at some point.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Definitely play that.

210
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Otherwise, I decided, based on a new forum we have in our Orange Launch Radio forums,

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
there's a PC gaming forum, and somebody had posted a thread about what freeware games

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
have you been playing.

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And I think Dartetsuya made a post that reminded me that there's a freeware game called Every

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Extend, which the PSP game Every Extend Extra is based off of.

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So I decided, well, I played the Every Extend Extra demo, and I really sucked at it, so

216
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I wanted to see if maybe I could try and pick up the game again.

217
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So I downloaded Every Extend, and it's actually pretty fun.

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It was a lot of fun, so much so that I decided to spend the $20 and get Every Extend Extra

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
on the PSP.

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So I'll know more about that game next week when I've actually played it some more.

221
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You found it today?

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, it was actually easy to find.

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
GameStop has it cut down to $20.

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Too bad GameStop is evil, but wow.

225
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Well, you know, I'll get it wherever I can get it, because I use their online search

226
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
for the store to shut up.

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Also, I got a present.

228
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Loki got me a Christmas present.

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Can I play it right now?

230
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I got Final Fantasy III on the DS.

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No, you may not.

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Please?

233
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No, you may not.

234
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Well, I'm going to punch you in the face.

235
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Then I will play it.

236
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Only I get to de-virginize my cartridge.

237
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You know that feeling, like when you buy a new game, you don't want someone else to

238
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
crap out your-

239
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Have sex with it first?

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Or someone else to crap up your game with their save file, right?

241
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's like, you want to be the first one to turn it on, see the opening cinema, all

242
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
that stuff.

243
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You don't want someone else to skank it up.

244
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So, I don't want you to dirty up my game.

245
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So, maybe next time you're here.

246
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's in forever from now.

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's not my fault you're going away for Christmas.

248
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I think it is.

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So, I'll know more about Final Fantasy III next week, because I just got it like 10 minutes

250
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
ago from Loki.

251
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You rock, Loki.

252
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Thank you so much.

253
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You know what else I got for Christmas from Extrofer?

254
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I got my Christmas present from Extrofer today.

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I was there.

256
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No, I did not get an STD reference.

257
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I got a Hello Kitty toaster.

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm so excited.

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can't wait.

260
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I need bread.

261
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I need bread.

262
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm having my Christmas present.

263
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What?

264
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That'll be my Christmas present.

265
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Awesome.

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
When you got it, did you make a high-pitched squealing noise?

267
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I did.

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I thought I heard you from the bathroom.

269
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Hopefully, that was me and not something, you know, some bathroom noise.

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What?

271
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Anyway, no, nothing.

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I guess that's it for my gaming week.

273
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't really have anything else to share.

274
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So, anyway, let's go to a little bit of housekeeping.

275
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And I mentioned that there were some new forums on our website at orangesontradiocom, and

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
you should definitely go check those out.

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There's a new PC gaming forum available on orangesontradiocom, and every weeknight show

278
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
has their own forum now.

279
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So if you're a Pump Up the Volume fan, she's got a whole forum there, Dark Sakura.

280
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And if you like guys on a show, there's a forum for that.

281
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
STFU on Thursdays, Travis Donovan on Saturdays, and something on Fridays.

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And then also we're in the process of revamping our news blog.

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So take a look for that this coming week.

284
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let's get into some gaming news now.

285
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We'll start it off with a little news about the Xbox 360.

286
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But this is the type of news that Microsoft is not going to be happy to hear.

287
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:12,000
One of the Xbox Live users who goes by the name of Redrum6622, Redrum, Redrum, I love

288
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
the shining, claims he's filed a class action lawsuit against Microsoft because of some

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
problems he had after their recent fall system update.

290
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This was posted on the official Xbox forum, so you can kind of take this with a grain

291
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
of salt because it's an official Xbox forum post and those can be a little crazy.

292
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
He basically said he filed this class action lawsuit, plaintiff versus Microsoft Corporation,

293
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
a Washington Corporation, blah, blah, blah.

294
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And then their summary of claims, blah, blah, blah, legal mumbo jumbo one.

295
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This is a class action against Microsoft and its affiliates for breach of contract, violation

296
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
of the Washington Consumer Protection Act, and alternatively negligence.

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and all other persons who experienced

298
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
hardware problems with their Microsoft 360 gaming consoles following installation of

299
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Microsoft's fall 2006 update for the Xbox 360.

300
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The parties, plaintiff, name blocked, is an individual resident of California.

301
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Plaintiff is the original purchaser and current owner of an Xbox 360 gaming console.

302
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Plaintiff brings this action individually and as a class action under Rule 23 of the

303
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of the class specified herein, blah, blah,

304
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
blah, blah, ipso facto, et cetera, et cetera.

305
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What do you think, Logy?

306
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But he's saying that it's in violation of Washington law, yet he's a California resident.

307
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Supposedly, that's what it is, yeah.

308
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Okay, and the other fact that the fall update only affected, the glitch in the fall update,

309
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I guess, only affected less than 1% of the 360s out there.

310
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You have to admit that's still a lot, though.

311
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay, that's true, to which any of them that were affected by that were immediately fixed

312
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and replaced, you know, if you called the 1-800 number.

313
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So it's not like they're saying, fuck you, you're just out of 360.

314
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
They're doing, you know, their part to fix it.

315
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So this is just some dumbass Californian who's trying to get more money from them.

316
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Pooh-fucking-hoo, your damn 360 broke.

317
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Send it in like everybody else and just get a new one.

318
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
God, is it really that big a deal?

319
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
ShadowNextGen in our chat room, which, by the way, hi, chat room, chat.orangelauntrader.com

320
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
if you want to join.

321
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
ShadowNextGen said, do just once attention.

322
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Is that what's going on?

323
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
He does once attention.

324
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Well, now you have his gamertag, so fucking send him hate mail.

325
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
There you go.

326
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
OL Army Alex says, I can't prove my 360 having died, though my useless posts in the forums

327
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and having called MS support twice count.

328
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
In other words, like how are you going to prove that your 360 was bricked?

329
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't know.

330
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I guess that's an interesting idea.

331
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Let's see.

332
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
There was another comment here.

333
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, Jumpman said, my 360 died.

334
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Microsoft gave me a new one and all is right with the world.

335
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
See?

336
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Is it that hard?

337
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I mean, they're aware of the problem and they were fixing them.

338
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So, what more do you want them to do?

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Fucking give you a blowjob or something?

340
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I mean, seriously, just this guy...

341
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You're a little bit feisty tonight.

342
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He needs to...

343
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Go ahead with your class action lawsuit.

344
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Who leveled your feathers before the show tonight?

345
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No, no, no.

346
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Go ahead with your class action lawsuit.

347
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Just because you have a lawsuit doesn't mean you're going to win.

348
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I hope you waste all the money in the world and I hope your 360 doesn't work afterwards.

349
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So, fuck you.

350
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Macman in our chat says it's about time someone sued Microsoft.

351
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Rise, my iMac.

352
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Rise from your grave.

353
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Get it?

354
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Altered Beast reference?

355
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Get it?

356
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Altered Beast.

357
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's a good game.

358
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I know.

359
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Altered Beast.

360
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I said I won't buy it on Virtual Console.

361
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Not for eight bucks.

362
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Not when it's not the arcade version.

363
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Anyways, so, more craziness, 360 related, of course, this week.

364
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:43,000
On Monday, during Monday Night Football, the first kind of teaser trailer for Halo 3 was

365
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
aired on TV in the course.

366
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Everybody and their brother basically took this and decided, hey, you know what, be fun.

367
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Let's change the music on it, just like we did with the Mad World ad for Heroes of War.

368
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You know, I thought it was a pretty cool trailer.

369
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I mean, I like it.

370
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's just like it has the same impact as the first one, I think.

371
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The first teaser during E3.

372
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm really psyched for the game.

373
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Hopefully, we'll hear something from the beta, you know, despite the fact that there's

374
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
probably going to be, you know, tight lipped.

375
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I swear I could not sign up for the beta.

376
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I tried like 50 times and I couldn't get in on it.

377
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Stupid sight.

378
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It was funny because they had the link up for the beta before the beta thing even launched,

379
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
so I signed up then.

380
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah, so did I.

381
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I didn't have to worry about the feature.

382
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Well, la di da di, you both.

383
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But, some of us have to actually work at work and can't refresh constantly.

384
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This is not me on the site.

385
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I didn't hit refresh constantly.

386
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I read it in a blog and then I went and signed up.

387
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I also signed up for Shadowrun, so hopefully I get in on one of those.

388
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Because, to be honest, the last one I played was Test Drive Unlimited and, you know,

389
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
just the PlayStation 2 version is not as good as the 360 one.

390
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But, yeah, Halo 3 looks cool.

391
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I mean, we know it's going to be pretty good.

392
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So, just have to wait until they tease us with more shit.

393
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Of course, many folks in our chat room are talking about how they signed up for the beta.

394
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Jeremy Todd 1 says, I signed up for the beta, but still, there's like.9% of actually getting

395
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
into the beta.

396
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Too many Halo fanboys.

397
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But, here's the thing, though.

398
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
There's going to be more ways to get into the beta as the weeks go along.

399
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This is straight from my EA rep because we were like, once we saw that the beta...

400
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The fuck does EA know about Halo, though?

401
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Not EA.

402
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Microsoft.

404
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
My Microsoft rep.

405
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Good job.

406
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Good job, Loki.

407
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Sorry.

408
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Whatever.

409
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
He's human, folks.

410
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I was looking at something that said EA and, you know, it's a slip.

411
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Anyways, yeah, my Microsoft rep because we were like, hey, how can you get us into this

412
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
beta?

413
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Come on.

414
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Pull some strings.

415
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And, he's like, no.

416
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,680
I want to play some pimps at sea, as it was called when folks were spotting them on Xbox

417
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,680
Live this week, testing Halo 3.

418
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,280
You really think we're going to have to wait all the way to next Thanksgiving for this

419
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
game?

420
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,000
I mean, jeez, they're advertising it like it's coming out tomorrow, it seems like, with

421
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
all this hype.

422
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,640
I don't think we'll have to wait, and to be honest, I really...

423
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,880
They're pretty much, you know, if they're going in the beta, I mean, the game's almost

424
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
done then.

425
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,160
I mean, they wouldn't be going in the beta if it was, you know, being put out in November.

426
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,120
I mean, that's a perfect example right there.

427
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,240
The beta test is in the spring because it's a beta test.

428
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,960
It means the game's right about to come out.

429
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:43,640
So, you know, I think it's definitely going to be hitting the, probably the stores around

430
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
the end of March.

431
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
Oh, I see.

432
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Mid-March.

433
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,560
There's going to be some interesting stuff, though, because this, you know, beta sign-up

434
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,240
was mainly for the US and North America type stuff.

435
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,560
However, if you're in the UK, there's going to be a few ways you can get signed up, and

436
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,340
there's actually quite a list of websites, depending on which country you're in, that

437
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,580
you can sign up.

438
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,720
They have limited slots for the beta available.

439
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:22,480
Such sites, for example, the UK Rewired Mine, 360 Monster, BritXBox, msxboxworld.com, totally360.com,

440
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,720
and of course, Germany's got a bunch of different sites, well, PlanetXBox, et cetera.

441
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,120
So, you know, definitely take a look out there.

442
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,720
There's tons of links.

443
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,800
I know IGN ran a story with some of this stuff.

444
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,600
So, if you're looking to get signed up and you don't live in the United States, then

445
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,880
definitely check these out, because they haven't finished their beta sign-ups yet.

446
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,480
You know, I suck at Halo, like I'm really, really bad at Halo, but I think the game is

447
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,400
presented just beautifully, and you know, I'm getting suckered into this marketing campaign

448
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,640
stuff a little bit.

449
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,080
My hype meter's going up a little bit.

450
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
I'm excited for this.

451
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,200
I've played Halo 2 maybe twice in my life.

452
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,680
When are you going to get Halo 3?

453
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
I'll get Halo 3.

454
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
Sucker.

455
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Why?

456
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
It's a first-person shooter.

457
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
It looks fun.

458
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
It'll be fun.

459
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
I'm sure it'll be good.

460
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
It's a good multiplayer game.

461
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
It's like Call of Duty 3.

462
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,960
I've been playing Call of Duty 3, and that's okay.

463
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,960
I mean, there's a few things that...

464
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,800
I don't understand why they're making sequels, why they don't just improve on the original

465
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
one.

466
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,880
They always have to take content out, and it's really obvious stuff that should be in

467
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,040
there, like I don't know, a radar or something when the gunfire is going off.

468
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,240
You can see where the person is on the map, flash where they're at.

469
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,280
That was perfect for Call of Duty 2, so you had to be quiet, but now you can just fire

470
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,520
away and no one knows where the hell you are.

471
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,120
I don't know.

472
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,520
I haven't really played that series.

473
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Couldn't tell you.

474
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
Couldn't tell you.

475
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,760
Well, you know, Loki messed up there and was talking about EA, but maybe it was a bit of

476
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,040
a slip because the next story is about EA, and that's right.

477
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,440
You know how EA is famous for putting out things on Marketplace that basically just

478
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,520
unlocks things you could get in the game anyway.

479
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:19,680
Well, Need for Speed Carbon has gotten their list on Xbox Live now of some various custom

480
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:26,040
car packages, an aftermarket hoods bundle and spoilers bundle and roof scoops and a

481
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,600
87 Toyota Corolla that you can now purchase for various amounts of points, and this is

482
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,560
just all crap that you can basically unlock in the game if you're patient, at least most

483
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,040
of this I believe.

484
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,760
I think some of the cars are exclusive to that.

485
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,560
I think maybe the 87 Corolla, but most of that other stuff you can get in the game if

486
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
you're just patient.

487
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
Exactly.

488
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
So, whatever.

489
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,080
Well, other news about EA, and this was kind of cool because I like Burnout.

490
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,180
Burnout's awesome.

491
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:01,700
They're doing a special Burnout game for the PS2 and PlayStation Portable, Burnout Dominator,

492
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,520
and from what I've gathered from the press release so far is it's going to be similar

493
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,800
to the Burnout Legends game on the PSP.

494
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,520
Kind of a culmination of the entire series so far, featuring all the tracks from one

495
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:23,280
all the way through three and probably also Burnout 4 or Revenge.

496
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,120
Looks cool, kind of a good way to end the series on the PlayStation 2.

497
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,680
Maybe there might be another PSP version, assuming this one does okay.

498
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,680
But Burnout 5 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and the 360, so that will be

499
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,080
kind of fun to look forward to.

500
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,480
Hopefully they have one for the Wii because that would be kind of cool too.

501
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Burnout on the Wii?

502
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
I don't know.

503
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
They have Excite Truck on the Wii.

504
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Yeah, I guess.

505
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
I don't know.

506
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
It would be a little weird.

507
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,520
I actually, one game, I don't think I mentioned this during my gaming week, but I have been

508
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,880
playing Burnout on the 360 quite a bit this week for no particular reason.

509
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,040
I just wanted to play more Burnout and have custom soundtracks and all that fun stuff.

510
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,680
And I also really suck at Burnout, so I don't just suck at Halo, I suck at Burnout too.

511
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,360
Good times.

512
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,560
I will definitely check out the next Burnout on 360 though.

513
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,140
It will be fun.

514
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,480
Something else I might have to check out at some point, there's a new magazine that is

515
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,560
being made.

516
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,960
It's called, get this, Wii 60 Magazine.

517
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,380
Somebody took this whole concept about getting a Wii and getting a 360 and they have decided

518
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,760
to run with it and they're creating a magazine called Wii 60.

519
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,800
It's being called an underground movement birthed by the most noble of players during

520
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,280
the E3 2006 conference.

521
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:43,000
They're calling it the unadulterated voice of truth in this generation of gaming.

522
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,920
These men of valor are some of the most important people in the video game industry and their

523
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,520
voice must be heard not just from coast to coast but from pole to pole.

524
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,400
What the, who writes this crap?

525
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,120
Probably the same people that are going to be writing this magazine and to be honest

526
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,520
it's probably going to suck.

527
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,360
These people really love themselves.

528
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:08,040
Well anyway you can check out www.Wii60.com to get more information on the magazine if

529
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,600
you are curious about this and want to check it out.

530
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,480
Now what's interesting is that there is a Wii60.com but the link here leads to Wii60.tv

531
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,800
so I'm not sure what that's all about.

532
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Maybe there's two sites.

533
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Not sure.

534
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,080
Maybe you should type it in and look.

535
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
I'm looking.

536
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
I'm looking.

537
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,320
No it looks like Wii60.tv looks like the real site.

538
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Oh get this.

539
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:38,120
The publisher's name is Martin Lokey Alessi and his email address is lokey at Wii60.tv.

540
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:45,040
Here's another magazine that will be stealing from you Lokey.

541
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,760
Blaze in our chat room says, hi I write for the magazine Wii60 and I fucking rule heart.

542
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,400
James Patrick calls this the hate on Sony magazine.

543
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:59,160
Those comments from me come from our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

544
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:05,440
Anyways speaking of the Wii, Sony and Microsoft may have a Wii dilemma.

545
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,120
Haha I get it.

546
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:17,100
If you know basically this what Jack Uldrich from Motley Fool if what he says is correct.

547
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,000
Basically it makes sense.

548
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,540
This is kind of what they're targeting towards.

549
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,380
Since the Wii is kind of aiming at that you know casual gamer, non-gamer, people that

550
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,760
haven't picked up a video game system yet market, they may be able to actually grow

551
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,520
the games market and basically instead of just trying to target the same people that

552
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,040
have you know say a Playstation 2 or Xbox or GameCube, they can actually get a bunch

553
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:49,480
of new gamers with the Wii and if that's the case, the 360 and the Playstation 3 might

554
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,880
not be able to have the same poll with their systems because they're kind of too I guess

555
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:00,160
hardcore and probably more expensive which case they could actually end up you know coming

556
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,800
ahead of everybody else because that was also the same thing before during E3 where the

557
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,360
Wii was going to be everyone's second system.

558
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,900
Well if it's everyone's second system then of course it's going to be the system that's

559
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,900
sold the most.

560
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,240
I don't know.

561
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,720
I think it's interesting.

562
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
It makes sense.

563
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,480
Uldrich is basically quoted as saying unfortunately because most of the time and energy for the

564
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,920
past year has been focused on providing more horsepower and fancier graphics for existing

565
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,960
customers the hardcore gamers demand the upgrades found in the Playstation 3.

566
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,680
Sony has not busied themselves in developing products that appeal to non-gamers.

567
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,160
As a result, it appears that they are now behind the curve in development of simpler

568
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,720
to use and less expensive technologies like the Wii and it makes sense.

569
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,480
I mean the Playstation 3 is that's a lot of money to drop on a system that you might not

570
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,040
be sure you know about and whereas the Wii I think it's pretty much pick up and go type

571
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,760
of thing especially since it comes with its own new game already.

572
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,160
Hmm.

573
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,560
Interesting I mean so you kind of agree with what's going on here with this story?

574
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:09,040
I think so but then again the 360 I think you know with Sony though I don't rule out

575
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,080
that they're not going to try to copy more stuff that the Wii is doing.

576
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,200
I mean I think there is already some patents registered for more devices like the Wiimote.

577
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,560
I wouldn't be surprised if they try to copy everything that you know the Wii is doing.

578
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,360
Even if they did copy it though do you think it would work?

579
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:32,400
I don't think so because even still so you already have some games that appeal to a casual

580
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
gamer.

581
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,600
Well a casual gamer is not going to drop $600 for your system.

582
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
That's true.

583
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,000
Also I kind of think about you know I don't know I think about the Wii and I think about

584
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,880
all those real big brand names that Nintendo has and big franchises like Metroid and Smash

585
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,120
Brothers and Mario and Zelda and you know you get my point but then on Sony I think

586
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:00,000
about franchises and I don't know they don't have that same I can't picture them in that

587
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,660
well there's not a lot of franchises in Sony that Sony really owns I mean they're all third

588
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,080
party franchises really.

589
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,160
That's the thing is when you think about Nintendo you think okay Mario, Zelda, and you know

590
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:17,120
Metroid when you think about Microsoft and 360 you think Halo and well that's pretty

591
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:23,480
much it Halo but still when you think of Sony you kind of have trouble thinking of an actual

592
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,000
franchise you know that's exclusive to them maybe you know Gran Turismo and God of War

593
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,040
but they don't really have any like mascots or any you know games that really people buy

594
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
the system for.

595
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,800
I mean I guess in the middle of your solid four but I mean the air talking now that's

596
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:46,040
going to be on both systems so really they're just Final Fantasy 13 question mark?

597
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,000
You know if let me put it this way if Final Fantasy 13 for the Playstation 3 okay if it

598
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,280
ends up that the Xbox 360 is sold tens of millions more systems than say the Playstation

599
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,320
3 at the time the game is coming out I will bet you anything that they will be putting

600
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:09,120
out on the Xbox 360 as well as the Playstation 3 if not only on the Xbox 360.

601
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,080
Footy Monster in our chat room responded to something I said earlier saying Sky but on

602
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,160
the other hand Nintendo has no third party so far.

603
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,200
Well yes and no I mean the third party they don't have any like really huge third party

604
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,160
franchises the way that maybe some of the other consoles do but third parties do seem

605
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,000
to be sort of rallying around the Wii a little bit I mean they want to put out some of their

606
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,160
franchises on there like and it has gotten support at least at their launch I mean Red

607
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,720
Steel was a big title even though it was a critical hit and miss.

608
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,200
Trauma Center was a great game even though it wasn't really widely picked up on but it

609
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,160
was a little more critically aware so Elibits is looking to be a big title that's made by

610
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:55,760
Konami so you know I think some of the mistakes made with GameCube in regards to third party

611
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,760
are definitely already on their way to being remedied with the Wii.

612
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,000
The more Wii's that get out there the more third parties that will want to develop for

613
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
it.

614
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,720
And here's the other thing too I mean Squaresoft I mean I know that they're really dedicated

615
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,880
to Sony but I mean at some point they're going to have to understand okay this system you

616
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,520
know let's say a year from now when Final Fantasy 13 is coming out say that they're

617
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,160
not able to sell as many systems as they would have liked for the PlayStation 3 so they're

618
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,720
behind by say 10 million systems.

619
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,280
Why would I develop for a system that has less units out there less of a chance for

620
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,400
me to make my money back when there's a system that's cheaper to develop for and has a lot

621
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:41,240
more systems out there and is capable of doing comparable graphics?

622
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,440
I don't understand why that would be pure idiocy to just develop for the one system

623
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:53,120
that's why you have companies like you know Koei developing Fatal Inertia and their Blade

624
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,940
Storm game for both systems now because to be honest they're not going to make their

625
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,360
money back if they just put it out on the PlayStation 3 and that's a big problem for

626
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
Sony.

627
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,120
They've got to figure out how to get these systems sold first off getting the systems

628
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,080
out there and give people a reason to buy this system because right now it's just seeing

629
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,640
that it has a blu-ray player well you know what a lot of people say who gives a shit

630
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,880
about blu-ray player I don't care right now because I'm not going to go replace my entire

631
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,760
DVD library.

632
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,200
Interesting thoughts if you agree or disagree send us an email because we'll get to the

633
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,140
emails a little later in the program mailbag at orangesloungeradio.com meanwhile we got

634
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,760
to keep going through the news and speaking of Nintendo Wii very interesting I don't know

635
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,900
if this would be news or rumor the thing is that it's coming from a foreign website and

636
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,640
not to discount what foreign websites might be saying but you know we kind of get a little

637
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,760
bit until we see like a you know press release from Nintendo of America we're not really

638
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,820
sure what to think of this but according to this website cyamite.de they were reporting

639
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,840
that you're going to be able to download Wii game demos you can either store the demos

640
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:04,480
in your flash ram on the console or to an external SD card now what's kind of interesting

641
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,120
about this is that well the Wii doesn't have exactly that much internal memory I mean it's

642
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,960
got what about 512 megs yep and by the time you start downloading all this other stuff

643
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,600
that Nintendo's planning to put out like the internet channel you know things of that nature

644
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,680
that stuff's going to start to fill up especially with some of the other big virtual console

645
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,940
releases so you know where are these demos going to go I guess there's the SD card but

646
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:30,180
still it seems a little not quite I don't know well one thing to keep reading and they're

647
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:37,200
saying that there's support for USB hard drives and USB devices coming but you have to have

648
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,380
the latest update to be able to store stuff to it the only thing is though is this update

649
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:47,160
I think people are talking about isn't out yet and from what the rumors I've been reading

650
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:53,240
are that an update with the internet channel is going to support USB hard drives as well

651
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,960
if that's the case then they can store them to that and I'm sure you'll see a Nintendo

652
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,320
hard drive of some sort that'll plug in via the USB ports on there I don't know that looks

653
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,240
sounds like a little after the fact I mean I really wish they would have put more storage

654
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,840
in the system but that's a little bit disappointing I would have thought they would have put more

655
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,200
storage inside the actual system itself but I mean I guess you know they want to keep

656
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,600
it cheap so it makes sense okay that's fine if you want to keep it cheap fine build a

657
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,960
port for a hard drive then well it's not what the SD card slots for really cuz you can fit

658
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,200
quite a bit on those little cards I mean and they were good enough to that you can put

659
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,720
any SD card in there in fact you know most people are saying screw these official Nintendo

660
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:41,080
SD cards I'm gonna go buy I'm gonna go buy the cheaper ones and use those I've been using

661
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,680
the card for my camera phone to send pictures if I was digging through the my phone the

662
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,780
other day and I saw a picture of you at E3 outpost it's really funny cuz you're like

663
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,200
leaning over the couch and going rawr but you can see Bobby Blackwolf in the background

664
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,800
like doing some busy work so I send it to Bobby and I drew like a big arrow in the in

665
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,440
the paint channel I put who dat or something like that so I've been having fun with the

666
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,640
camera phone converter thing SD card and I put I put Zelda on it just for fun even though

667
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:17,800
I know I can't play it on other Wii's just for fun I'm gonna say I got Zelda in my pocket

668
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,120
cuz I'm lame like that anyways so there is another story that came out very vague this

669
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:29,400
week was coming from a magazine called games TM and oh wait I gotta say that this is a

670
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,520
very good point James Patrick is saying 360 has no hard drive in its core bundle true

671
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:40,760
that's a good point but they had a port for one though true okay you got that and it does

672
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,680
have some internal memory but not that you can save games on really it's just for you

673
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:53,840
know updates and things like that yeah anyways so yeah there is a very vague comment from

674
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:02,240
the magazine says something big coming to Wii Virtual Console and how big is it well

675
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,640
it doesn't say what hell am I reporting is this news I know what what the fuck kind of

676
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:16,960
news there is something something big is on its way well you know better be some damn

677
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,080
you know Reggie fees amaze about to make a big duty that you can download on your virtual

678
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:28,960
console this Monday I want my fucking Nintendo games TurboGrafx-16 is great and all but uh

679
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,320
give me more Nintendo games you know what the hell where's my kid Icarus where's my

680
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:42,320
guardian legend where's my super Castlevania 4 which they have overseas where's my link

681
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,280
to the past which they have overseas damn you people where's my Super Mario Brothers

682
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:56,520
Super Mario World Mario Kart Mario Kart 64 damn you Reggie anyways well you know this

683
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,960
might be enough to sway you back into a like in the TurboGrafx-16 downloads there are some

684
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,580
rumors abounding that Alien Crush which was a pretty badass TurboGrafx-16 game and Dungeon

685
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:12,040
Explorer on their way to the Wii's Virtual Console now the story here is kind of vague

686
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,400
you're not sure if they mean it's coming out this week or that it's coming out in the future

687
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,660
so I'm thinking it means it's coming out soon so whether that means this week or the future

688
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:27,580
I mean we just did kind of get a big clump of TurboGrafx-16 games supposed to be every

689
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,760
Monday yeah but but do we have to be getting TurboGrafx and Genesis every Monday I mean

690
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,960
don't get me wrong there's some good games there but there's things I want more on the

691
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,320
NES and if somebody in chat was saying Gunstar Heroes is rumored for this Monday I imagine

692
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,600
the four games we're gonna get probably are just gonna be games that are available elsewhere

693
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,760
but who knows which ones I tried using my credit card to put more points on my Virtual

694
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,800
Console account and didn't work really mine works fine yeah mine it I guess their network

695
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,620
was having trouble or something but you know plenty of money on there definitely not broke

696
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:08,080
or anything so I don't know stupid stupid virtual console and of course now everybody

697
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,020
in the chat room is talking about I want I want I want I want I want let's see we've

698
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:19,320
got act deft I want my Super Mario RPG yeah monster once zombies ate my neighbors shadow

699
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,520
Charlie's okay with more Genesis as long as the streets of rage and shadow next-gen agrees

700
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,920
the mean link to the past on Virtual Console shadow next-gen also want Super Metroid on

701
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,720
VC hell yeah Dark Knight once pilot wings those are all good stuff property once Super

702
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,720
C that was a pretty cool game Super C I think is on game tap I think as well with the Contra

703
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,720
so you can always check it out there I I want the the Super Nintendo Contra though that

704
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,560
wasn't called Super C was it was something else Super Contra right I want that one that

705
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,040
was pretty cool because they had like the mode seven levels those are rad yeah anyways

706
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:01,920
so much like you know immersion did with the Sony PlayStation 2 dual shock controller another

707
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,800
company has claimed that they want to take Nintendo the court over the Wii remote because

708
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,640
they say they have a patent for it and very similar kind of lawsuit company called interlink

709
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:18,920
who has revealed that they have a device that's very similar to the Wii remote that they've

710
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,240
patented my guess they probably haven't created said device but you know they have a patent

711
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:29,160
for it anyways and basically you know going to try to get some money out of Nintendo you

712
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:36,440
know different companies same song it sounds like but gotta hate hate when these companies

713
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,980
do this stuff because they totally create patents for stuff that they don't imagine

714
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:47,440
on that they're not going to even use just the because they probably hear that some companies

715
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,040
make it something similar well what if this did legitimately already exist well it looks

716
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,000
like crap anyways it looks like it to be honest looking at this right now it it looks like

717
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,880
a TV remote it that's all it looks like it it looks like it has an infrared emitter inside

718
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:14,000
the actual device you know controller I guess and then there is a receiver that you know

719
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,920
would be an infrared receiver so if anything I would say that the people that created like

720
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:26,360
a TV remote would be able to sue over the Wii remote because I don't know this I think

721
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,400
there's enough different with the two devices that they probably won't well now it says

722
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,520
here that in the come I'm reading through the complaint here and this patent was filed

723
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,760
by the other company on February 1st 2005 long before anyone knew anything about the

724
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:48,520
Wii so true though okay so it was filed 2005 doesn't mean though that they weren't you

725
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:54,400
know that I'd want to see when the patent was filed for the Wii remote because apparently

726
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:02,360
the Wii has been in production for a long time I don't know oh I see it's it's you use

727
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,920
it in operating the computer from far away they use it between it's they made it for

728
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,720
the computer it's probably to it's like one of our point yeah it's one of the yeah it's

729
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,840
one of those things I'll let you run like the PowerPoint shows from a room from I have

730
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:19,060
I want to work that's just saying like that a TV remote though basically I mean that's

731
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:26,240
basically what it is interesting I mean isn't that what a TV remote is I mean or D like

732
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,480
a DVD remote for example you know that would be basically what it is because you know I

733
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:38,360
use the PlayStation 2 DVD remote to navigate menus and stuff it's very similar to this

734
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:44,720
it uses IR as well I just think that they're too different I mean this is very similar

735
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:50,800
to say a TV remote than it is you know the Wii remote Raven's Dolphin says the Wii trigger

736
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:59,140
goes through Bluetooth not infrared they will lose exactly hmm well you know these lawsuits

737
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:03,200
that seemingly come out of nowhere when something gets popular they make us angsty and we get

738
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,000
really angry about this stuff because we don't want anyone taking away our we so that means

739
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:18,920
it's about time for the F use of the week

740
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,920
since dark soccer is not here tonight Loki you're gonna have to start us off if you to

741
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:33,600
dark soccer for not being here yeah if you to the ferret I want to say f you to rpm racing

742
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:39,200
because they're number 11 car had fucked up traction on it so I kept slamming into the

743
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:47,920
wall and I actually had to get pitted one lap because they black flagged me fuck you

744
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:58,760
to rob for the fact that you know pretty good music I like this let's see I would have to

745
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:05,480
say gosh I don't have a lot to be angsty about today I would say an F you to the rain and

746
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,360
it being so cold out recently an F you to the fact that I'm spoiled by California weather

747
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:14,600
so what's what's cold right now probably isn't really cold to other people so if you to the

748
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:21,280
weather lately has been kind of crappy that's it left the room because he has a bad headache

749
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,000
I guess DER gave him a headache so maybe it's not here to put in his F you so F you to headaches

750
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:36,480
and Advil it doesn't work anyhow let's go into our next story which is about the spike

751
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:44,520
TV VGA's if I'm not mistaking did you these have an air jet have they I think they're

752
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:57,360
going to air it taped on Friday but it's going to air on what the 13th probably spoiler alert

00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,600
we're going to ruin it for you right now here's who won at the spike TV game of the year was

771
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:43,160
guys who do Mega64.com it was really cool you know I met them at an E3 a couple years

772
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,080
ago and they seemed really offended I didn't know who they were I mean I know who they

773
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,820
are now but at the time they seemed really offended that I didn't know who they were

774
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:55,600
I'm like sorry but somebody explained it to me afterwards I'm like oh that Tetris video

775
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:01,120

782
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:42,200
as they came out on stage yeah as Ravenstaufen1 says in chat I did boo 50 Cent when he came

785
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:00,280

787
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:12,360
a little bit of back and forth that's going on on destructoid.com because you made a comment

00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:45,000
a huge asshole throughout the show comments were you a big asshole throughout the show

794
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,480
yes I was I'll admit that I don't see how anyone can take it seriously though the show

795
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,240
it's terrible you know what I think it's funny because you're right all these celebrities

796
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:01,680
are just coming out how many of them do you think actually play games how much of 50 cents

797
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,640
game do you think he actually played I think these celebrities just show up to these events

798
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,400
because they know it's something they can add to their resume and say that they were

799
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:18,200
on TV right yeah definitely although the guy who was Superman Superman Returns I can't

800
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:25,400
think of his name Brandon Routh he's a he was obviously a big Warcraft fan when he introduced

801
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,960
the World of Warcraft Burning Crusade video why did he come out there and go Leroy Jenkins

802
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:38,640
he do that nobody he said he he had played Warcraft 2 and mentioned a lot about how he

803
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:46,600
liked wizard so so you didn't see at least one gamer out there so you didn't boo him

804
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:52,080
no okay so somebody if somebody earned their cred with DJ Tyrant then they didn't get booed

805
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:57,160
all right yeah I cheered for Gears of War I haven't played it but they definitely deserve

806
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:02,360
the respect it's a good game if you're into first-person shooters it's a good game all

807
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:07,640
right well anything else you want to say about the award show watch it and see if you can

808
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,440
hear me during it no they'll they'll they'll have muted you or bleeped you out that's that's

809
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,360
why they don't air it live because they're too they're too chicken shit to air it live

810
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,800
because these these celebrities egos would be damaged if heaven forbid they could pick

811
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:28,640
up in the background some a-hole in the bleachers no offense going your game sucks so they're

812
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,540
they're they're doing that post editing right now bleeping you out and probably blurring

813
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:38,000
your seat they'll work hard what well I made them work hard there you go that's all that

814

815
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,520
be faked the entire show most likely was there a lot of thunderous applause did they have

816
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:54,000
the lights that say applause applause or did they bring a girl on stage they had a lot

817
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,240
of seat fillers though a lot of seat fillers oh like the people they pay to go fill in

818
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:05,400
the celebrity seats when they go to the bathroom yeah they were they were all in the front

826
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:49,600

827
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:55,120
the video game awards and how he was a big jerk but you know what it's you know you can't

828
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,880
take celebrities seriously like if Britney Spears had come out I would have yelled you

829
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,800
know where's your panties you know because you know because of all the pictures recently

830
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:11,160
anyway forget it anywho back to some news um you know I'm starting to think we should

831
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:21,480
really curb from now on any stories that are from an analyst I mean seriously the rumors

832
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,640
come back up again from an analyst saying that Apple is entering the console market

833
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:33,440
and their take on it is basically we think that the video game market represents a distinct

834
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,480
possibility for Apple especially considering that it recently announced that the availability

835
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:44,440
of video games for its iPod through the iTunes store that's not a reason that's stupid that's

836
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,280
like I don't get it every fucking week on this program for the past almost five years

837
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,280
what do we sit here and do we sit here and analyze the game scene that's what we do and

838
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:00,520
nobody's ever thrown money at us I don't get it these finance if I got a degree would they

839
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:05,280
throw money at us in in whatever these people have degree in marketing analysis or whatever

840
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,120
and they don't even have to be right they're like the goddamn weatherman of you know the

841
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:15,200
fucking video game industry or whatever industry they're having to be reporting on oh I think

842
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:21,660
that you know squirrels are gonna fly on my ass today and if it doesn't happen who cares

843
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:26,600
because I'm an analyst and if I'm wrong well that's because the company's changed their

844
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:31,120
mind I mean it doesn't matter here's what Apple is gonna create next they're gonna create

845
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:36,120
their own line of sex toys you're gonna have the eye the Apple like I vibe or something

846
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:42,800
like that I mean seriously that is my analyst take on this because people like having fun

847
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,820
therefore they like being pleasured there you go you know have feel the bass through

848
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:54,440
the I vibe FireBoma calls it the eye-braider eye-braider whatever you know seriously this

849
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,880
is how ridiculous these stories are I for one I will not be putting talking about any

850
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:04,880
analyst crap from now on okay do you think it's feasible though that Apple could do a

851
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,800
console it's feasible that they could do a console I mean after all they're doing here's

852
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,340
what I think they would do if anything their ITV supporting some casual games and that's

853
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:19,220
about it I'd say I agree with that exactly I think that little you know much like video

854
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:23,540
games consoles in this generation 360 and the PlayStation 3 have been a Trojan horse

855
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:28,200
in the living room to do movies and TV and all that stuff I think Apple's gonna do that

856
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,080
in reverse I think they're gonna have put this Trojan horse in as a movie device and

857
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:37,120
then hey it'll play Zuma and Bejeweled too that's it that's it's not gonna be able to

858
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:42,960
run much anything else and have you tried playing any of these games on the Apple iPod

859
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:50,520
they suck so I mean seriously and you know I hate I hate to sound like the fucking Apple

860
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:57,360
hater but the Apple I mean their line of computers not exactly the biggest gaming machines I

861
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,600
don't think they know how to make gaming machines if they even really want I I you know I will

862
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:09,340
admit I love my now I love my Mac I love my little Mac laptop it's it's great I consider

863
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:13,760
myself bi when it comes to computers I like Apple sometimes I like you know PC's other

864
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,480
days but I don't exactly when I think hey I'm gonna go play some games on the computer

865
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,480
I don't exactly think about my Apple and there's nothing wrong with that I mean they could

866
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:28,040
they could come out with a game console I just I don't I think it's too late in the

867
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:33,920
game to come out with a new console right now and I think if they did it it would fail

868
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,260
it would be like you know the Phantom or something like that the Pippin Black Wolf says

869
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:45,240
apparently Tetris works really well on an iPod I I don't know I don't read but my iPod

870
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:50,360
was the old ass black and white one and it broke so I'm hoping I get gift certificates

871
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:55,120
this Christmas so I can get myself a new one but great then I can tell you blue ass though

872
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:01,120
and that's the thing I mean so great one and at the end of the day it's bejeweled again

873
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:06,400
I mean you know you can't take this seriously as a console unless there's new things to

874
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,880
breathe life and anything you know what I will admit there was one time you know with

875
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,400
Apple II that they had good games on there I mean you know you had some pretty good stuff

876
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:26,280
on the Apple II but uh that that day is long past so well if you agree or you disagree

877
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,380
again the mailbag is always open I'm trying to see if the chat rooms had anything to say

878
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:34,080
about that but a lot of them are talking about trying to find those Britney Spears pictures

879
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:39,320
again because I guess not everybody heard about it uh Loki why don't you take the next

880
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:47,120
story too anyways so there was a game that's been announced here um which I mean I know

881
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:52,640
that we're slightly a you know fan of the show uh Little Britain it's a show that's

882
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,760
run in um the UK and also on BBC America yeah it's on BBC America um it's as very these

883
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:04,000
do very well it's actually a parody of life in in Britain and they've got a bunch of different

884
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:11,240
characters in there almost reminds me a little bit of like um kind of a modern take on say

885
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,320
Monty Python everybody's got kids in the hall kind of yeah kind of kids with two people

886
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:19,800
but um it yeah it's basically these two guys and it's hilarious it's a funny show well

887
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,280
they're ba- making a brand new PlayStation 2 game based off of it and it's gonna be a

888
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:30,440
collection of a bunch of mini games and it's just it's pretty funny looking from what I've

889
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,440
seen so far what the hell are you gonna do with the Little Britain game don't be wrong

890
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,800
I love the show but I can't really picture it as a game I mean are you gonna go around

891
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,920
yelling I am the only game in the village no I that was funny that you mentioned that

892
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:48,080
because actually they that was one of the the advertisements on the um the story they

893
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:54,360
said you know I am the only game in the village no there's actually one though um one scene

894
00:57:54,360 --> 00:58:00,920
that I saw where you're riding around um trying to basically scare away the other gays that

895
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,240
are in the village so that you can become the only game in the village you know just

896
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:09,800
it's it's funny it's basically gonna be a collection of is there like is there gonna

897
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,960
be like a music game for rap for the one girl that goes no but yeah but yeah but yeah but

898
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:18,400
yeah and I you know her that tells all the the stories and stuff um basically anyways

899
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,160
so the game is going to be like I said a collection of mini games presented in a format of an

900
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:28,400
episode of the TV show and since players can enter um can get interactive with their favorite

901
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,960
sketch show characters um in the series of eight mini games featuring Lou and Andy, Vicki

902
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:43,360
Pollard, which you know no but yeah, uh Mr. Man, uh Emily and Florence, we got a lady!

903
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:50,800
Majorie Dawes, um Daphne Thomas, uh Judy and Maggie and Letty and says each mini game plays

904
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,800
like a sketch from the TV show to win the game players must progress through all the

905
00:58:54,800 --> 00:59:00,680
sketches to the end of the show or the credits will roll and um I don't know they have and

906
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,120
that's coming out here in America too?

907
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:06,560
I don't think so I think it's only in the UK and it's coming out on PC because you won't

908
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:11,320
even be able to import that oh if it's PC you can PC PlayStation Portable you can get

909
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:17,600
the PlayStation Portable version and um PlayStation 2 the PlayStation 2 and PC versions will be

910
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:24,880
out January 22nd um and then May for the PSP version so we can import the you know the

911
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,400
PSP one which might be fun is what's-his-name from Buffy in it and Anthony Stewart Head

912
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:34,120
is that his name is he in it um I'm not sure but like they've got you know examples here

913
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:38,480
oh here's a screenshot you know really great radio here but it's one of the mini games

914
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:45,480
where you're smashing objects okay so I I don't know smashing frogs it looks like so

915
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:54,800
I don't know it'll it'll be funny but interesting I'm sure it will be a good game anywho so

916
00:59:54,800 --> 01:00:01,120
um kind of moving on to a completely different topic here the Xbox 360 well we know that

917
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:08,680
it has an HD DVD drive well guess what it's gonna be people are using it to copy HD DVDs

918
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:15,800
to rip them to their PC because the HD DVD drive uses a USB port and a connection or

919
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:23,040
USB connection and can be um you know you can do the 1080p connection over component

920
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:29,760
cables you can actually use a video capture card to capture that and then dump it of course

921
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:36,880
to your hard drive for backup purposes only of course um of course you know the PlayStation

922
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:43,840
3 I think does the same thing with blu-ray I mean I don't know but later on um I suppose

923
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:48,320
when they're gonna require the HDMI cables that might be able to circumvent some of the

924
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:54,440
stuff but right now you can dump them via that I don't know oh I'm sure this has the

925
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:59,280
movie industry so excited whatever I mean it's their own fault that they couldn't figure

926
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,760
out a way they encrypted I still don't know what movies I really want on HD DVD I guess

927
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,160
I'm still waiting for the format to kind of take off that's the thing too like there was

928
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:13,320
a movie that I wanted but it's only on blu-ray interesting annoying you know that you're

929
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:19,800
gonna get a PlayStation 3 eventually right maybe I mean I don't know probably interesting

930
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,560
I got I got berated by the wife because she's like I thought you said you weren't gonna

931
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:28,800
get one of those I'm like what you just got excited about the you know motorstorm games

932
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:35,200
so all right well moving on to some ads that were about the PlayStation 3 they were run

933
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,840
by Circuit City and a joystick picked up some of these Circuit City ads running it under

934
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:44,400
the headline circuit city faults or stupid advertising you decide that's again on joystick

935
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,480
with a q.com which is interesting because they talk about some things from the catalog

936
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:54,860
and how it said PlayStation 3 ready to rumble it's hot and of course you know the joke would

937
01:01:54,860 --> 01:02:00,480
be that the PlayStation 3 does not in fact rumble and it has been overheating yeah and

938
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:06,520
so using the word hot is kind of funny as well and also I guess they show people playing

939
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:11,920
Xbox 360 Madden yet the controllers are off you know because you know Holly even when

940
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,920
even if you have a wired controller the Xbox guide button glows green with what you know

941
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,880
player you're in well of course in the picture you know obviously it's posed I mean they're

942
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,020
not really playing the game this isn't too hard to figure out but of course the anal

943
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:29,680
gamer will notice that the lights are off and so in fact the controllers are not plugged

944
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:36,680
in did you see the one of the we though on there no I did I missed that one there's a

945
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:44,400
picture with the Wii saying that the Wii can be played without a TV because it has a built

946
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:52,280
in projector into it what I'm serious I am wasn't that one of the old rumors about the

947
01:02:52,280 --> 01:03:00,480
was one of the old rumors but if that's how like somebody did not get the memo it's really

948
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:09,640
bad but I how does this like get through I mean seriously how does this get by without

949
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:16,120
people you know noticing this stuff so seriously because there's no gamers that work at circuit

950
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:21,040
cities proofreading department no here it is right here it's it's actually take a look

951
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:27,560
at the the story again it says the USB port lets you plug in the game system to a project

952
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:34,240
and play or to project and play on awesome eleven and a half foot widescreen and that

953
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:41,960
was for the Wii that might actually be for the 360 whatever it's still wrong it doesn't

954
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:49,160
matter the turned off Xbox 360 controllers playing Madden on a projection television

955
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:57,920
supposedly attached to the Xbox 360 by a USB cable interesting whatever it's just obviously

956
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,220
all that stuff supposed you know people read a little bit too much into that stuff well

957
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:10,200
you may not be able to actually you know have a projector built into your Xbox 360 or we

958
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:17,620
but you can make your own power glove and that's what someone's done actually they have

959
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:24,720
modified a power glove to put a black we remote on it and they've captured the hearts of geeks

960
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:31,000
everywhere for about five minutes until the next video comes out with something else even

961
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:37,800
more shiny I don't know it's stupid but I'm sure someone was going to do it at some point

962
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:45,800
and I'm sure someone has commented on this video it's so bad let me see how many posts

963
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:55,840
it took to say it's so bad you know I am actually surprised oh oh oh eight posts eight posts

964
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:01,720
all right there you go speaking of things that are so bad this is this is so so bad

965
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:07,840
it's good I mean like so awesome you know bad meaning good get this the DS Lite has

966
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:12,560
some new decals being made for it you can turn your DS Lite you know you can use the

967
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:18,840
decals to change your DS Lite and they're being sold by Sanrio that's right you can

968
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:25,520
make your DS Lite the Hello Kitty DS Lite oh how fun is that going to be for the low

969
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:32,840
low price of 680 yen that's about five dollars and ninety cents you can get this from Sanrio

970
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:37,880
so awesome and they look best by the way on the pink DS's just so you know goodie just

971
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:42,840
more reason for me to get a pink DS Lite this Christmas well those pink lights are going

972
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:46,720
for a lot of money actually on eBay from what I've been hearing really of course my customers

973
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,680
are still in stock in most places no eBay people are selling out of them quick interesting

974
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:59,880
anyways apparently Canada is bleeding up your DS stylus future shop you can actually purchase

975
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:10,900
a 18 karat gold stylus for the low low price of $19.99 and wow Neil that would really suck

976
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:17,760
if you lost that one because is that like one of the fat ones or the light light so

977
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,800
then it's like one of the fat pens because the DS Lite actually had a fatter pen and

978
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:28,120
my guess is probably it's gold plated it'd be funny if this is gold painted well it might

979
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:35,700
be painted in the 14 karat gold or whatever it is I don't know all right well something

980
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,440
else I'm sure people are going to be paying a lot of money for depends if they decide

981
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:44,960
to charge this for this or not but there is a huge rabid fan base around the television

982
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,080
show that used to be on the air called Firefly and you might remember they made it into a

983
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:53,880
movie as well called serenity I didn't really follow the TV show but extra firm you know

984
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:59,200
my roommate is a huge Whedon whore you know Buffy and angel and all that so I got dragged

985
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,000
to see serenity the day it opened it wasn't bad I was right it was pretty good I didn't

986
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,640
fall if I did get an HD DVD player I would buy serenity serenity a good movie for HD

987
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:11,520
or any sci-fi movie really would be good well that's not what I'm reporting on what I'm

988
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:18,840
talking about is that this has been licensed for an MMO multiverse has struck a deal with

989
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:25,520
Fox to put the Firefly property into the MMO ring now keep in mind this is very early on

990
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:31,160
there's no development team yet put together like this but they want to do a type of Star

991
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:37,940
Wars galaxy type game but they say they will make it unique and fun and interesting so

992
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:43,280
it probably won't happen till 2008 but that could be very interesting and there's certainly

993
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,080
a huge fan base out there that'll at least check this out for curiosity factor alone

994
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:51,640
what'd you think I think so I didn't even check it out even though I don't know much

995
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:56,920
about the series it's like you know space cowboys I mean it's it's definitely unique

996
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,200
and who doesn't love cowboys in outer space you gotta love the fact that the show's been

997
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:06,240
canceled you know and the series has been canceled and it's not coming back there's

998
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,880
not going to be a sequel to Serenity yeah but isn't that what happened to Star Trek

999
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,960
the original Star Trek got canceled pretty early on and then they made a movie and it

1000
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:18,520
became huge but then again Serenity unfortunately did not quite have a huge box office success

1001
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:26,180
call it Firefly the movie yeah oh well anyway that's our last story for this part A of Orange
