1
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:24,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, December 10th, 2006, Microsoft gets sued over Brick 360s, the old Apple entering the console market rumor resurfaces, and is the PlayStation 3 harming the acceptance of Blu-ray?

2
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:36,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:42,722
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that video game program dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:52,008
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts and unfortunately not joining us this week is DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, but we do have the ferret to speak for her in her place.

5
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:56,430
[SPEAKER_03]: She's actually in L.A.

6
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,871
[SPEAKER_03]: this week.

7
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,573
[SPEAKER_03]: She's spinning around on the teacups back at Disneyland.

8
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:00,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, again?

9
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:01,515
[SPEAKER_03]: She's at Disneyland again?

10
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:03,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she's there with Chris and, oh well.

11
00:01:04,418 --> 00:01:05,579
[SPEAKER_03]: She's not here this week.

12
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,323
[SPEAKER_03]: She was going to call in with a special report, but I guess she got too dizzy because I didn't see anything on the Skype line.

13
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:11,785
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe she'll bug us later.

14
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:12,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

15
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:15,168
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meantime, the one and only Loki is joining us here tonight.

16
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:16,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

17
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:17,450
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

18
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:17,990
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

19
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing okay.

20
00:01:19,552 --> 00:01:19,832
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

21
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:24,818
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of weird because we haven't been live in a while, like since before Thanksgiving.

22
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:28,380
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we missed that show Thanksgiving week and then we were pre-taped last week.

23
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:35,064
[SPEAKER_03]: And now this week, it doesn't feel like a full thing because it's just you and me and there's no DarkSakura.

24
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:39,567
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no special guest yet, although supposedly Miklatov's going to be here.

25
00:01:40,487 --> 00:01:46,390
[SPEAKER_03]: But like an hour before we went live, they were like, Bye, we're going to go play DDR at the bowling alley.

26
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:47,351
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like...

27
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:48,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Viva PiÃ±ata

28
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:26,045
[SPEAKER_04]: until which the game decided I don't want to play it anymore, which is ironic because I really didn't want to play it anymore because, well, it froze up on me.

29
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:30,126
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game itself was just very kind of boring.

30
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:36,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I got really bored with it really quick, so I plan on selling it back since I didn't pay for it in the first place.

31
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know, can't recommend it.

32
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:41,528
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess if you stick with it long enough, it might be fun.

33
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I just found it very, very, very annoying, so.

34
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:45,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

35
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:47,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Played more Excite Truck, because that's fun.

36
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:48,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Played more Wii Sports.

37
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:57,282
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been doing more of the Wii Sports bowling, and my friend who's used to being in a bowling league was kicking our ass, so whatever.

38
00:02:57,523 --> 00:03:08,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, I don't know, just waiting for Elebits this week, and actually I'm going to probably try to pick up Far Cry Vengeance as well, so those will be fun.

39
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And more Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories, and

40
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:16,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, that's pretty much it.

41
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:35,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, was it on Tuesday, actually, I'm going to be hooking up the Wii in our kind of giant theater at work that we have for a demonstration for all the sales staff, and it's going to be kind of cool because we get to use my wireless sensor bar that I made, so I'm going to be playing the Wii on a giant screen.

42
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:40,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually tried it out on Friday, and it worked out pretty good, so I'm looking forward to that.

43
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:44,974
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the meantime, just kind of kicking back and waiting for some better games to come out, and

44
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,160
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

45
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:18,778
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the reason that you decided to go to RPM today?

46
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:19,018
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

47
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:41,453
[SPEAKER_03]: What made him decide to do RPM of all places?

48
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:42,936
[SPEAKER_04]: He likes race cars.

49
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:45,803
[SPEAKER_04]: He likes to drag cars and everything.

50
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:48,911
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought it'd be fun to go down there because I've never been down there.

51
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:50,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

52
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:23,591
[SPEAKER_04]: The second car I got really sucked, and the tires were all fucked up on it, so it wouldn't grip it, and I kept spinning out and hitting the wall.

53
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:25,612
[SPEAKER_04]: And, I don't know, it was fun, though.

54
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:28,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine what Loki must be like at one of these places?

55
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:33,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's right, the music's starting.

56
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:36,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, oh, it's like initial D!

57
00:05:38,058 --> 00:05:39,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready, set, go!

58
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:44,676
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we should totally get out of here, though.

59
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:47,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything I need to know here I learned from Initial D!

60
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:49,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega Drift!

61
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:55,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, I left my little stupid Sega card at home.

62
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:56,399
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I going to do?

63
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:57,340
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun, though.

64
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, we should go do it.

65
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the show.

66
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be fun.

67
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:05,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's something we should put on YouTube.

68
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,762
[SPEAKER_03]: We could, too, because you could film it.

69
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:08,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Only if we get loaded.

70
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:09,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we go.

71
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:10,903
[SPEAKER_03]: God.

72
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:13,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't drink and drive, kids.

73
00:06:13,383 --> 00:06:14,963
[SPEAKER_03]: We're only kidding.

74
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I'd mention that, though.

75
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:21,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a bit of Motorstorm at a kiosk at Best Buy, and I like it.

76
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:27,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's kind of cool, but it's a lot slower, though, than Excite Truck.

77
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,992
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, I really wish that EA would do a Burnout off-road series.

78
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:33,633
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what Motorstorm did for me?

79
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:38,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this game sucks!

80
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:40,777
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Motorstorm.

81
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:43,073
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

82
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:44,134
[SPEAKER_03]: When I played it at Target.

83
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:45,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi Miklatov!

84
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:47,256
[SPEAKER_02]: You decided to join us after all.

85
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:49,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we just got back from the bowling alley.

86
00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:50,057
[SPEAKER_02]: How's my mic?

87
00:06:50,197 --> 00:06:51,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're okay.

88
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:52,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have to turn you up a little bit.

89
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:53,259
[SPEAKER_03]: But how are you doing?

90
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired now.

91
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,661
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys want to go play the new DDR without me?

92
00:06:57,022 --> 00:06:57,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

93
00:06:57,602 --> 00:06:58,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not the new new DDR.

94
00:06:58,923 --> 00:06:59,883
[SPEAKER_02]: The newest DDR.

95
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:01,304
[SPEAKER_03]: The newest DDR to us in Sacramento.

96
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:02,145
[SPEAKER_03]: How was it?

97
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:05,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize how stupid I am when I make steps sometimes.

98
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right, because you do steps for the game.

99
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:14,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and we had to redo some steps a while ago for the Ultramix One songs.

100
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:18,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I played Gorgeous 2012 on doubles, and I played Heavy.

101
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:21,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if many people realize, but it has new Heavy steps.

102
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:24,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was playing, and I was like, oh, yeah, I remember making these.

103
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:25,013
[SPEAKER_02]: These are fun.

104
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:26,914
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it got to utter crap.

105
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:28,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what was I thinking?

106
00:07:29,036 --> 00:07:30,457
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just gave up and died.

107
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a large crowd there playing DDR?

108
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,500
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

109
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:40,254
[SPEAKER_02]: If me and Irene are a large crowd, then yeah, there was a very large crowd.

110
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:42,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to fix your mic here.

111
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:44,175
[SPEAKER_03]: How else was your gaming week?

112
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:48,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I played more Elite Beat Agents, trying to S everything on Hard Rock.

113
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:50,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I can hear myself.

114
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:51,476
[SPEAKER_02]: You're supposed to be able to.

115
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:52,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

116
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:55,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I played Elite Beat Agents.

117
00:07:56,477 --> 00:08:01,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I started playing Zelda again, and the fourth dungeon boss is the best boss fight I've ever played in my life.

118
00:08:02,118 --> 00:08:02,778
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so cool.

119
00:08:04,312 --> 00:08:09,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I don't think I did anything else besides that.

120
00:08:10,496 --> 00:08:11,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just been Zelda all week long?

121
00:08:12,137 --> 00:08:13,718
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because I don't play video games anymore.

122
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:17,280
[SPEAKER_03]: When have you been playing PSP and DS and all that stuff?

123
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,060
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP?

124
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,061
[SPEAKER_02]: When did I say I played PSP?

125
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Or DS, I'm fine, DS.

126
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:21,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Elite Beat Agents?

127
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:22,543
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it?

128
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:23,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

129
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:24,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

130
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,945
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my favorite game that I have on DS.

131
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:27,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good game.

132
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:29,147
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Elite Beat Agents.

133
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:29,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

134
00:08:31,222 --> 00:08:33,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello as well to someone else who's here.

135
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:34,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Rice Princess.

136
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:36,066
[SPEAKER_03]: God, we haven't seen you in forever.

137
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:37,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's been a while.

138
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:38,268
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

139
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:38,929
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been playing?

140
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:40,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

141
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you take a guess?

142
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:43,633
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to get real close to the mic.

143
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:44,694
[SPEAKER_03]: These mics are not very sensitive.

144
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:45,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So what have you been playing?

145
00:08:45,554 --> 00:08:46,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you take a guess?

146
00:08:47,016 --> 00:08:47,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I can.

147
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:48,637
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it, Shane?

148
00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:50,098
[SPEAKER_03]: It rhymes with kawau.

149
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:52,160
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be right.

150
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,983
[SPEAKER_03]: It rhymes with World of Boarcraft.

151
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:56,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, shut up.

152
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you saying I'm the world of boar crap?

153
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Rob, you are a world of boar crap.

154
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:06,297
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

155
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:09,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what server are you on?

156
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:11,260
[SPEAKER_03]: What character class are you?

157
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,822
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing in the WoW or the Wob?

158
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:16,383
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wob?

159
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:19,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on Elder Thalyss and I PvP.

160
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:21,667
[SPEAKER_05]: All day long?

161
00:09:22,547 --> 00:09:23,588
[SPEAKER_05]: All day long.

162
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:23,908
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

163
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:26,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

164
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,170
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

165
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:27,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

166
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, have fun with your Wob.

167
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:30,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do that.

168
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:31,273
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

169
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:35,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, My Gaming Week, um, not a whole lot of new stuff.

170
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:40,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided to go back and rediscover, um, GameTap, because I haven't been playing it a lot lately.

171
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:48,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I decided to load that up, and they actually have some cool new stuff on there, because they have, like, the Castlevania games and Contra games from the old school, like, 8-bit NES are on there.

172
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:53,283
[SPEAKER_03]: and Silent Hill 2 is on GameTap, which it looks very nice.

173
00:09:53,463 --> 00:09:53,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very surprised.

174
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:59,548
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks better than it does on PS2 because, you know, it uses the advanced hardware on the computer to give the smoother textures and things.

175
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:01,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very, very pleased with that.

176
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,191
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can really control the resolution and everything.

177
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:03,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was really cool.

178
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:05,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And Civilization 3.

179
00:10:06,094 --> 00:10:09,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those who have listened to the show in the past, you guys know I love Civilization.

180
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:11,358
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my favorite PC game of all time.

181
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:15,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet Civilization 2 was such a shock to me that I just...

182
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:16,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

183
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:37,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not liking it.

184
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:38,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go play it some more.

185
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:38,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

186
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:45,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll have to play some OLR listeners because it's multi... Although I don't even know anyone else with GameTap besides our webmaster, VxJasonXV.

187
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:47,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still waiting for Myst Online to come out on there.

188
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:49,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not played the Sam & Max game yet, though.

189
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:50,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I will at some point.

190
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely play that.

191
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:56,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I decided based on a new forum we have in our...

192
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Launch Radio Forums, PC Gaming Forum

193
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:21,443
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's actually pretty fun.

194
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:27,426
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot of fun, so much so that I decided to spend the 20 bucks and get every X10 extra on the PSP.

195
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:30,607
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll know more about that game next week when I've actually played it some more.

196
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:31,748
[SPEAKER_02]: You found it today?

197
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:33,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was actually easy to find.

198
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:34,790
[SPEAKER_03]: GameStop has it cut down to 20 bucks.

199
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, too bad GameStop is evil, but wow.

200
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:42,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I'll get it wherever I can get it because I use their online search the store to shut up.

201
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:47,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I got a present.

202
00:11:47,236 --> 00:11:48,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki got me a Christmas present.

203
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:50,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I got Final Fantasy 3 on the DS.

204
00:11:50,518 --> 00:11:51,099
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you may not.

205
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:52,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

206
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to punch you in the face.

207
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I will play it.

208
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:57,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Only I get to divergenize my cartridge.

209
00:11:58,122 --> 00:11:58,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

210
00:11:59,023 --> 00:11:59,703
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that feeling?

211
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:06,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you buy a new game, you don't want someone else to crap up your game with their save file, right?

212
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:11,810
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you want to be the first one to turn it on, see the opening cinema, all that stuff.

213
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,111
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want someone else to skank it up.

214
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:18,325
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

215
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited.

216
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:47,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait.

217
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:48,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I need bread.

218
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I need bread.

219
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,600
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be my Christmas present.

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,300
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

221
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,220
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be my Christmas present.

222
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:56,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

223
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:56,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it?

224
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:58,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you make a high-pitched squealing noise?

225
00:12:58,961 --> 00:12:59,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

226
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I thought I heard you from the bathroom.

227
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:07,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully that was me and not something, you know, some bathroom noise.

228
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:09,223
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

229
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:10,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nothing.

230
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's it for my gaming week.

231
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:14,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really have anything else to share.

232
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,209
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

233
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:39,113
[SPEAKER_03]: RedRum6622 RedRum6622

234
00:14:08,328 --> 00:14:09,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Rum.

235
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:10,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Rum.

236
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:13,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I love The Shining.

237
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:20,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Claims he's filed a class action lawsuit against Microsoft because of some problems he had after their recent fall system update.

238
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,615
[SPEAKER_03]: This was posted on the official Xbox forum.

239
00:14:23,675 --> 00:14:29,358
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you can kind of take this with a grain of salt because it's an official Xbox forum post and those can be a little crazy.

240
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:36,843
[SPEAKER_03]: He basically said, he filed this class action lawsuit, plaintiff versus Microsoft Corporation, a Washington corporation, blah, blah, blah.

241
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:39,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's summary of claims, blah, blah, blah, legal mumbo jumbo.

242
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:48,131
[SPEAKER_03]: One, this is a class action against Microsoft and its affiliates for breach of contract, violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act, and alternatively, negligence.

243
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:59,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and all other persons who experienced hardware problems with their Microsoft 360 gaming consoles following installation of Microsoft's Fall 2006 update for the Xbox 360.

244
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:00,956
[SPEAKER_03]: The parties.

245
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:04,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Plaintiff, name blocked, is an individual resident of California.

246
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:08,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Plaintiff is the original purchaser and current owner of an Xbox 360 gaming console.

247
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:15,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Plaintiff brings this action individually and as a class action under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of the...

248
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:19,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Class specified herein, blah, blah, blah, ipso facto, etc., etc.

249
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:20,803
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think, Loki?

250
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:25,290
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's saying that it's in violation of Washington law, yeah, he's a California resident.

251
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:28,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I... Supposedly, that's what it is, yeah.

252
00:15:28,558 --> 00:15:37,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and the other fact that the fall update only affected... The glitch in the fall update, I guess, only affected less than 1% of the 360s out there.

253
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,820
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to admit, that's still a lot, though.

254
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's true.

255
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:46,722
[SPEAKER_04]: To which, any of them that were affected by that were immediately fixed and replaced, you know, if you called the 1-800 number.

256
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:49,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like they're saying, fuck you, you're just out of 360.

257
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:52,524
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing, you know, their part to fix it, so...

258
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:56,268
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just some dumbass Californian who's trying to get more money from them.

259
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:59,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Boo fucking hoo, your damn 360 broke.

260
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:01,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Send it in like everybody else and just get a new one.

261
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:04,637
[SPEAKER_04]: God, is it really that big a deal?

262
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:10,664
[SPEAKER_03]: ShadowNextGen in our chatroom, which by the way, hi chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join.

263
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:13,247
[SPEAKER_03]: ShadowNextGen said, dude just wants attention.

264
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:14,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what's going on?

265
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:15,498
[SPEAKER_03]: He does want attention.

266
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:18,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now you have his gamer tag, so fucking send him hate mail.

267
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,020
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

268
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:27,624
[SPEAKER_03]: OL Army Alex says, I can't prove my 360 having died, though my useless posts in the forums and having called MS Support twice count.

269
00:16:28,464 --> 00:16:31,886
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, how are you going to prove that your 360 was bricked?

270
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

271
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:35,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's an interesting idea.

272
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

273
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:39,410
[SPEAKER_03]: There was another comment here.

274
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Jumpman said, My 360 died.

275
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:43,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft gave me a new one and all is right with the world.

276
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:44,017
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

277
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:46,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it that hard?

278
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:49,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're aware of the problem, and they were fixing them.

279
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:51,662
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what more do you want them to do?

280
00:16:51,822 --> 00:16:53,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking give you a blowjob or something?

281
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:54,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously.

282
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:58,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Just... This guy... You're a little bit feisty tonight.

283
00:16:58,107 --> 00:16:59,928
[SPEAKER_04]: He needs to... Go ahead with your class action lawsuit.

284
00:16:59,948 --> 00:17:01,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Who ruffled your feathers before the show tonight?

285
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:01,549
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

286
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:02,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead with your class action lawsuit.

287
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because you have a lawsuit doesn't mean you're gonna win.

288
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:09,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you waste all the money in the world, and I hope your 360 doesn't work afterwards.

289
00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:10,255
[SPEAKER_04]: So, fuck you.

290
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:14,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Macman in our chat says, It's about time someone sued Microsoft.

291
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise, my iMac.

292
00:17:15,822 --> 00:17:17,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise from your grave.

293
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:18,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it?

294
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:19,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Altered Beast reference.

295
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:20,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it?

296
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:22,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Altered Beast.

297
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,050
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good game.

298
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:23,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

299
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:23,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Altered Beast.

300
00:17:23,952 --> 00:17:25,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I said I won't buy it on Virtual Console.

301
00:17:25,453 --> 00:17:26,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for eight bucks.

302
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:28,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Not when it's not the arcade version.

303
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so more craziness, 360 related, of course, this week.

304
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:54,394
[SPEAKER_04]: On Monday, during Monday Night Football, the first kind of teaser trailer for Halo 3 was aired on TV, and of course, everybody and their brother basically took this and decided, hey, you know what, it'd be fun, let's change the music on it, just like we did with the Mad World ad for Gears of War.

305
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:58,315
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I thought it was a pretty cool trailer.

306
00:17:58,675 --> 00:17:59,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I like it.

307
00:17:59,615 --> 00:17:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: It

308
00:18:00,174 --> 00:18:02,896
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, it has the same impact as the first one, I think.

309
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:04,578
[SPEAKER_04]: The first teaser during E3.

310
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really psyched for the game.

311
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:15,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we'll hear something from the beta, you know, despite the fact that there's probably going to be, you know, you know, tight lip.

312
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:17,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear I could not sign up for the beta.

313
00:18:17,908 --> 00:18:19,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried like 50 times and I couldn't get in on it.

314
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid site.

315
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:25,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny because they had the link up for the beta before the beta thing even launched, so I signed up then.

316
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:28,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so did I. I didn't have to worry about the page.

317
00:18:28,217 --> 00:18:29,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, la-di-da to you both.

318
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:35,525
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of us have to actually work at work and can't refresh constantly on the site.

319
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:37,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't hit refresh constantly.

320
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:40,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I read it in a blog and then I went and signed up.

321
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I also signed up for Shadowrun, so hopefully I get in on one of those.

322
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:54,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, to be honest, the last one I played was Test Drive Unlimited and, you know, just the PlayStation 2 version is not as good as the 360 one.

323
00:18:54,376 --> 00:18:56,957
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, Halo 3 looks cool.

324
00:18:57,498 --> 00:18:57,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

325
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:02,061
[SPEAKER_04]: We know it's going to be pretty good, so... Just have to wait!

326
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Until they tease us with more shit.

327
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, many folks in our chatroom are talking about how they signed up for the beta.

328
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:13,208
[SPEAKER_03]: JeremyTodd1 says, I signed up for the beta, but still, there's like .9% of actually getting into the beta.

329
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:14,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Too many Halo fanboys.

330
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:16,930
[SPEAKER_04]: But, here's the thing, though.

331
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,752
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be more ways to get into the beta as the weeks go along.

332
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:26,196
[SPEAKER_04]: This is straight from my EA rep, because we were like, once we saw that the beta... The fuck does EA know about Halo, though?

333
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:27,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Not EA, I'm sorry.

334
00:19:27,377 --> 00:19:27,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft.

335
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:27,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft.

336
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna play some Pimps at Sea!

337
00:19:54,864 --> 00:19:59,665
[SPEAKER_03]: as that was called when folks were spotting them on Xbox Live this week, testing Halo 3.

338
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,647
[SPEAKER_03]: You really think we're going to have to wait all the way to next Thanksgiving for this game?

339
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:09,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, jeez, they're advertising it like it's coming out tomorrow, it seems like, with all this hype.

340
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:11,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we'll have to wait.

341
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:22,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, I really... They're pretty much, you know, if they're going in the beta, I mean, the game's almost done then.

342
00:20:22,927 --> 00:20:27,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they wouldn't be going into the beta if it was, you know, being put out in November.

343
00:20:27,368 --> 00:20:29,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's a perfect example right there.

344
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:33,390
[SPEAKER_04]: The beta test is in the spring because it's a beta test.

345
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,251
[SPEAKER_04]: It means the game's right about to come out.

346
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:45,414
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I think it's definitely going to be hitting the, probably the stores around the end of March, mid-March.

347
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:47,855
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some interesting stuff, though, because this,

348
00:20:48,896 --> 00:20:54,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Beta sign-up was mainly for the US and North America type stuff.

349
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,803
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if you're in the UK, there's going to be a few ways you can get signed up.

350
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:05,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's actually quite a list of websites, depending on which country you're in, that you can sign up.

351
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:08,030
[SPEAKER_04]: They have limited slots for the beta available.

352
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Such sites, for example, the UK, Rewired Mind, 360 Monster, BritXbox...

353
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:27,537
[SPEAKER_04]: MSXboxWorld.com, Totally360.com, and then of course Germany's got a bunch of different sites as well, PlanetXbox, etc.

354
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,878
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely take a look out there.

355
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:32,478
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tons of links.

356
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:45,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I know IGN ran a story with some of this stuff, so if you're looking to get signed up and you don't live in the United States, then definitely check these out because they haven't finished their beta signups yet.

357
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:49,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I suck at Halo.

358
00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:54,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really, really bad at Halo, but I think the game is presented just beautifully.

359
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:58,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting suckered into this marketing campaign stuff a little bit.

360
00:21:58,635 --> 00:21:59,936
[SPEAKER_03]: My hype meter is going up a little bit.

361
00:22:00,157 --> 00:22:00,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited for this.

362
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:05,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played Halo 2 maybe twice in my life.

363
00:22:06,163 --> 00:22:07,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to get Halo 3?

364
00:22:07,704 --> 00:22:08,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get Halo 3.

365
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:08,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucker.

366
00:22:10,388 --> 00:22:10,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

367
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:11,649
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a first person shooter.

368
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:12,109
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks fun.

369
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,590
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

370
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:13,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it'll be good.

371
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,031
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good multiplayer game.

372
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:16,272
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Call of Duty 3.

373
00:22:16,312 --> 00:22:19,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Call of Duty 3 and that's okay.

374
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:24,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's... There's a few things that... I don't understand why they're making sequels.

375
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:27,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Why they don't just improve on the original one.

376
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,500
[SPEAKER_04]: They always have to take content out.

377
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:33,142
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really obvious stuff that should be in there.

378
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:35,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know, a radar or something.

379
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:38,686
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when the gunfire is going off, you can see where the person is on the map.

380
00:22:39,435 --> 00:22:40,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Flash, where they're at.

381
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:44,159
[SPEAKER_04]: That was perfect for Call of Duty 2, so you had to be quiet.

382
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,922
[SPEAKER_04]: But now, you can just fire away, and no one knows where the hell you are.

383
00:22:47,942 --> 00:22:50,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

384
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:52,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really played that series.

385
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:52,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Couldn't tell you.

386
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:53,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Couldn't tell you.

387
00:22:54,188 --> 00:23:02,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, Loki messed up there and was talking about EA, but maybe it was a bit of a slip, because the next story is about EA, and...

388
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:10,955
[SPEAKER_03]: EA is famous for putting out things on Marketplace that basically just unlocks things you can get in the game anyway.

389
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:20,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Need for Speed Carbon has gotten their list on Xbox Live now of some various custom car packages.

390
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:30,740
[SPEAKER_03]: and aftermarket hoods bundle and spoilers bundle and roof scoops and a 1987 Toyota Corolla that you can now purchase for various amounts of points.

391
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,101
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just all crap that you can basically unlock in the game if you're patient.

392
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,242
[SPEAKER_03]: At least most of this, I believe.

393
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:39,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some of it, some of the cars, I think, are exclusive to that.

394
00:23:39,844 --> 00:23:46,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a couple, I think maybe the 87 Corolla, but most of that other stuff you can get in the game if you're just patient.

395
00:23:46,988 --> 00:23:49,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, so, yeah, whatever.

396
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:53,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, other news about EA, and this was kind of cool, because I like Burnout.

397
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:54,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Burnout's awesome.

398
00:23:55,082 --> 00:24:01,125
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing a special Burnout game for the PS2 and PlayStation Portable, Burnout Dominator.

399
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:08,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And from what I've gathered from the press release so far, is it's going to be similar to the Burnout Legends game on the PSP.

400
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:17,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a culmination of the entire series so far, featuring all the tracks from 1 all the way through 3, and probably also...

401
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:21,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Burnout 4 or Revenge.

402
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:23,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks cool.

403
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a good way to end the series on the PlayStation 2.

404
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:29,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there might be another PSP version.

405
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:30,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Assuming this one does okay.

406
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:36,740
[SPEAKER_04]: But Burnout 5 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and the 360s.

407
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,762
[SPEAKER_04]: So that will be kind of fun to look forward to.

408
00:24:39,022 --> 00:24:40,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully they have one for the Wii because that would be kind of cool too.

409
00:24:42,224 --> 00:24:43,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Burnout on the Wii?

410
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:43,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

411
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:45,387
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Excite Truck on the Wii.

412
00:24:45,547 --> 00:24:45,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

413
00:24:46,047 --> 00:24:46,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

414
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:46,848
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be a little weird.

415
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:47,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

416
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:52,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, one game, I don't think I mentioned this during my game of the week, but I have been playing Burnout on the 360 quite a bit this week.

417
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:58,512
[SPEAKER_03]: For no particular reason, I just wanted to play more Burnout and have custom soundtracks and all that fun stuff.

418
00:24:58,952 --> 00:25:02,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also really suck at Burnout, so I don't just suck at Halo, I suck at Burnout too.

419
00:25:04,595 --> 00:25:05,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

420
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:09,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I will definitely check out the next Burnout on 360 though.

421
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:10,998
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be fun.

422
00:25:11,923 --> 00:25:12,183
[SPEAKER_03]: WEEE60 Magazine

423
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:58,060
[SPEAKER_03]: it's being called an underground movement birthed by the most noble of players during the E3 2006 conference they're calling it the unadulterated voice of truth in this generation of gaming these men of valor are some of the most important people in the video game industry and their voice must be heard not just from coast to coast but from pole to pole what the who writes this crap what probably the same people that are going to be you know writing this magazine and to be honest it's probably going to suck

424
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:00,872
[SPEAKER_03]: These people really love themselves.

425
00:26:01,212 --> 00:26:10,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyway, you can check out www.we60.com to get more information on the magazine if you are curious about this and want to check it out.

426
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:18,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what's interesting is that there is a we60.com, but the link here leads to we60.tv, so I'm not sure what that's all about.

427
00:26:18,706 --> 00:26:19,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's two sites.

428
00:26:21,235 --> 00:26:22,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you should type it in and look.

429
00:26:23,136 --> 00:26:23,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking, I'm looking.

430
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:28,217
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it looks like we60.tv looks like the real site.

431
00:26:28,277 --> 00:26:28,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, get this.

432
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:40,681
[SPEAKER_03]: The publisher's name is Martin Loki Alessi and his email address is loki at we60.tv Here's another magazine that'll be stealing from you, Loki.

433
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:42,422
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.

434
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:43,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate people.

435
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:49,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaze in our chatroom says, Hi, I write for the magazine We60 and I fucking rule, heart.

436
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:53,315
[SPEAKER_03]: James Patrick calls this the hate on Sony magazine.

437
00:26:53,355 --> 00:26:57,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Those comments from me come from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

438
00:26:58,796 --> 00:27:03,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, speaking of the Wii, Sony and Microsoft may have a Wii dilemma.

439
00:27:03,677 --> 00:27:06,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

440
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:16,180
[SPEAKER_04]: If, you know, basically this, what Jack Aldrich from Motley Fool, if what he says is correct,

441
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:19,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it makes sense.

442
00:27:19,074 --> 00:27:20,695
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of what they were targeting towards.

443
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:44,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Since the Wii is kind of aiming at that casual gamer, non-gamer, people that haven't picked up a video game system yet market, they may be able to actually grow the games market and basically, instead of just trying to target the same people that have, say, a PlayStation 2 or Xbox or GameCube, they can actually get a bunch of new gamers and

444
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:46,222
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

445
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:12,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

446
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:13,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's interesting.

447
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes sense.

448
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:28,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Aldrich is basically quoted as saying, Unfortunately, because most of the time and energy for the past year has been focused on providing more horsepower and fancier graphics for existing customers, the hardcore gamers demand the upgrades found in the PlayStation 3.

449
00:28:28,695 --> 00:28:33,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony has not busied themselves in developing products that appeal to non-gamers.

450
00:28:33,617 --> 00:28:41,160
[SPEAKER_04]: As a result, it appears that they are now behind the curve in development of simpler to use and less expensive technologies like the Wii.

451
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:42,699
[SPEAKER_04]: And it makes sense.

452
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:48,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the PlayStation 3 is... That's a lot of money to drop on a system that you might not be sure about.

453
00:28:49,302 --> 00:28:53,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And whereas the Wii, I think, it's pretty much pick up and go type thing.

454
00:28:53,404 --> 00:28:56,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially since it comes with its own game already.

455
00:28:58,266 --> 00:28:58,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

456
00:28:58,807 --> 00:28:59,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

457
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:02,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so you kind of agree with what's going on here with this story?

458
00:29:02,668 --> 00:29:03,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

459
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:04,930
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, the 360, I think...

460
00:29:07,194 --> 00:29:11,917
[SPEAKER_04]: With Sony, though, I don't rule out that they're not going to try to copy more stuff that the Wii is doing.

461
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:17,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think there is already some patents registered for more devices like the Wiimote.

462
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:23,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be surprised if they try to copy everything that the Wii is doing.

463
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:25,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if they did copy it, though, do you think it would work?

464
00:29:26,406 --> 00:29:32,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so, because even still, so you have some games that appeal to a casual gamer.

465
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a casual gamer is not going to drop $600 for your system.

466
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:37,918
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

467
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:52,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I kind of think about, you know, I don't know, I think about the Wii and I think about all those real big brand names that Nintendo has and big franchises like Metroid and Smash Brothers and Mario and Zelda and, you know, you get my point.

468
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:54,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony, Nintendo, Mario, Zelda, Metroid, Halo, Nintendo

469
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:17,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 4, Final Fantasy XIII

470
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me put it this way.

471
00:30:47,653 --> 00:31:07,569
[SPEAKER_04]: If Final Fantasy XIII for the PlayStation 3, if it ends up that the Xbox 360 has sold tens of millions more systems than, say, the PlayStation 3 at the time the game's coming out, I will bet you anything that they will be putting it out on the Xbox 360 as well as the PlayStation 3, if not only on the Xbox 360.

472
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:15,743
[SPEAKER_03]: FootyMonster in our chatroom responded to something I said earlier, saying Sky, but on the other hand, Nintendo has no third party so far.

473
00:31:15,944 --> 00:31:16,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

474
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:17,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.

475
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:28,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the third party, they don't have any really huge third party franchises the way that maybe some of the other consoles do, but third parties do seem to be sort of rallying around the Wii a little bit.

476
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:31,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they want to put out some of their franchises on there.

477
00:31:32,031 --> 00:31:34,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has gotten support, at least at their launch.

478
00:31:34,432 --> 00:31:38,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Red Steel was a big title, even though it was a critical hit and miss.

479
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:41,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Trauma Center was a great game, even though it wasn't

480
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:42,617
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

481
00:32:09,855 --> 00:32:22,225
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, at some point they're going to have to understand, okay, this system, you know, let's say a year from now when Final Fantasy XIII is coming out, say that they're not able to sell as many systems as they would have liked for the PlayStation 3.

482
00:32:22,645 --> 00:32:25,127
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're behind by, say, 10 million systems.

483
00:32:26,616 --> 00:32:39,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would I develop for a system that has less units out there, less of a chance for me to make my money back when there's a system that's cheaper to develop for and has a lot more systems out there and is capable of doing comparable graphics?

484
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:46,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why that would be pure idiocy to just develop for the one system.

485
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:55,542
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you have companies like, you know, Koei developing Fatal Inertia and their Bladestorm game for both systems now because...

486
00:32:56,447 --> 00:33:00,308
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, they're not going to make their money back if they just put it out on the PlayStation 3.

487
00:33:01,088 --> 00:33:02,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a big problem for Sony.

488
00:33:02,868 --> 00:33:05,949
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to figure out how to get these systems sold.

489
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:10,570
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, get enough systems out there and give people a reason to buy this system.

490
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Because right now it's just saying it has a Blu-ray player.

491
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?

492
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:16,631
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people say, who gives a shit about a Blu-ray player?

493
00:33:16,691 --> 00:33:20,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care right now because I'm not going to go replace my entire DVD library.

494
00:33:22,483 --> 00:33:23,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting thoughts.

495
00:33:23,183 --> 00:33:25,684
[SPEAKER_03]: If you agree or disagree, send us an email.

496
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we'll get to the emails a little later in the program.

497
00:33:27,524 --> 00:33:32,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Meanwhile, we've got to keep going through the news.

498
00:33:32,786 --> 00:33:38,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of Nintendo Wii, very interesting... I don't know if this would be news or rumor.

499
00:33:38,427 --> 00:33:40,787
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is that it's coming from a foreign website.

500
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:49,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And not to discount what foreign websites might be saying, but we kind of get a little bit... Until we see a press release from Nintendo of America, we're not really sure what to think of this.

501
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,170
[SPEAKER_03]: But according to this website...

502
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,451
[SPEAKER_03]: and Siamite.de.

503
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:57,453
[SPEAKER_03]: They were reporting that you're going to be able to download Wii game demos.

504
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:02,835
[SPEAKER_03]: You can either store the demos in your flash RAM on the console or to an external SD card.

505
00:34:03,355 --> 00:34:08,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what's kind of interesting about this is that, well, the Wii doesn't have exactly that much internal memory.

506
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:10,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's got, what, about 512 megs?

507
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:10,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

508
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:20,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the time you start downloading all this other stuff that Nintendo's planning to put out, like the internet channel, you know, things of that nature, that stuff's going to start to fill up, especially with some of the other big virtual console releases.

509
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:20,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

510
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:23,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are these demos going to go?

511
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:27,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there's the SD card, but still, it seems a little... Not quite.

512
00:34:27,438 --> 00:34:27,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

513
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:40,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one thing to keep reading, and they're saying that there's support for USB hard drives and USB devices coming, but you have to have the latest update to be able to store stuff to it.

514
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:45,195
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing is, though, is this update I think people are talking about isn't out yet.

515
00:34:45,555 --> 00:34:47,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And from what the rumors I've been reading are,

516
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:53,309
[SPEAKER_04]: That update with the internet channel is going to support USB hard drives as well.

517
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:55,190
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's the case, then they can store them to that.

518
00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:00,992
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure you'll see a Nintendo hard drive of some sort that'll plug in via the USB ports on there.

519
00:35:02,493 --> 00:35:05,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it sounds like a little after the fact.

520
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:09,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I really wish they would have put more storage in the system, but

521
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:11,677
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a little bit disappointing.

522
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:17,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have thought they would have put more storage inside the actual system itself, but I mean, I guess, you know, they want to keep it cheap, so it makes sense.

523
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:18,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's fine.

524
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:19,460
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to keep it cheap, fine.

525
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Build a port for a hard drive, then.

526
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not what the SD card slot's for, really.

527
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:27,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can fit quite a bit on those little cards.

528
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:32,573
[SPEAKER_03]: and they were good enough that you can put any SD card in there.

529
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:36,734
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, most people are saying, screw these official Nintendo SD cards.

530
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:40,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go buy the cheaper ones and use those.

531
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been using the card for my camera phone to send pictures.

532
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:49,159
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I was digging through my phone the other day and I saw a picture of you at E3 Outpost.

533
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really funny because you're leaning over the couch and going, rawr!

534
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,462
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see Bobby Blackwolf in the background doing some busy work.

535
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:57,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So I send it to Bobby and I

536
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:00,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew like a big arrow in the paint channel.

537
00:36:00,344 --> 00:36:01,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I put, who dat?

538
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something like that.

539
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:07,387
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been having fun with the camera phone converter thing.

540
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:08,408
[SPEAKER_03]: SD card.

541
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:11,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And I put Zelda on it, just for fun.

542
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:12,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I know I can't play it on other Wii's.

543
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for fun.

544
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,471
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can say, I got Zelda in my pocket.

545
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:18,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm lame like that.

546
00:36:19,193 --> 00:36:23,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so there is another story that came out very vague this week.

547
00:36:23,795 --> 00:36:26,516
[SPEAKER_04]: It was coming from a magazine called Games TM.

548
00:36:27,405 --> 00:36:29,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and... But wait, I gotta say that this is a very good point.

549
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,327
[SPEAKER_03]: James Patrick is saying 360 has no hard drive in its core bundle.

550
00:36:34,347 --> 00:36:34,587
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

551
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:36,267
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.

552
00:36:36,287 --> 00:36:37,368
[SPEAKER_03]: But they had a port for one, though.

553
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:39,288
[SPEAKER_03]: True, okay.

554
00:36:39,628 --> 00:36:40,068
[SPEAKER_03]: You got that.

555
00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:44,309
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does have some internal memory, but not that you can save games on, really.

556
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,610
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just for, you know, updates and things like that.

557
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:48,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

558
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:50,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, anyways.

559
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:54,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yeah, there is a very vague comment from the magazine.

560
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:57,516
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, something big coming to Wii Virtual Console.

561
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:01,300
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh... How big is it?

562
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it doesn't say.

563
00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:05,143
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell am I reporting as this news?

564
00:37:05,204 --> 00:37:06,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, what the fuck kind of news is this?

565
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:08,527
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something coming!

566
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:11,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Something big is on its way!

567
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

568
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:23,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Reggie Fils-AimÃ© is about to make a big duty that you can download on your virtual console this Monday.

569
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, I want my fucking Nintendo games.

570
00:37:26,198 --> 00:37:30,399
[SPEAKER_04]: TurboGrafx-16's great and all, but give me more Nintendo games.

571
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:31,939
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what the hell?

572
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my Kid Icarus?

573
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my Guardian Legend?

574
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:40,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my Super Castlevania IV, which they have overseas?

575
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:43,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my Link to the Past, which they have overseas?

576
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,124
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

577
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:06,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Alien Crush, which was a pretty badass TurboGrafx-16 game

578
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Supposed to be every Monday.

579
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:31,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but do we have to be getting TurboGrafx and Genesis every Monday?

580
00:38:31,606 --> 00:38:37,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, don't get me wrong, there's some good games there, but there's things I want more on the NES.

581
00:38:37,728 --> 00:38:40,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody in chat was saying Gunstar Heroes is rumored for this Monday.

582
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:48,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine the four games we're going to get probably are just going to be games that are available elsewhere, but who knows which ones.

583
00:38:48,531 --> 00:38:53,293
[SPEAKER_04]: So I tried using my credit card to put more points on my virtual console account, and it didn't work.

584
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadow Charlie is okay with more Genesis as long as it's Streets of Rage.

585
00:39:22,984 --> 00:39:24,845
[SPEAKER_03]: and Shadow Next Gen agrees with me.

586
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:26,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Link to the Past on Virtual Console.

587
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Shadow Next Gen also wants Super Metroid on VC.

588
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:29,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.

589
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:31,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Knight wants Pilotwings.

590
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all good stuff.

591
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:36,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Proper T wants Super C. That was a pretty cool game.

592
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:39,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Super C, I think, is on GameTap.

593
00:39:39,355 --> 00:39:40,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I think as well, with the Contra.

594
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,057
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you can always check it out there.

595
00:39:42,577 --> 00:39:44,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the Super Nintendo Contra, though.

596
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,819
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't called Super C, was it?

597
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:46,320
[SPEAKER_03]: It was something else.

598
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Contra, right?

599
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that one.

600
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:50,342
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool, because it had, like, the Mode 7 levels.

601
00:39:50,362 --> 00:39:50,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are rad.

602
00:39:51,363 --> 00:39:51,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

603
00:39:52,324 --> 00:39:52,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

604
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:08,386
[SPEAKER_04]: So much like Immersion did with the Sony PlayStation 2 DualShock controller, another company has claimed that they want to take Nintendo the court over the Wii Remote because they say they have a patent for it.

605
00:40:09,186 --> 00:40:19,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And a very similar kind of lawsuit, a company called Interlink, who has revealed that they have a device that's very similar to the Wii Remote that they've patented.

606
00:40:20,057 --> 00:40:23,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they probably haven't created said device, but they have a patent for it anyways.

607
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:28,421
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, going to try to get some money out of Nintendo.

608
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:32,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Different company, same song, it sounds like.

609
00:40:34,964 --> 00:40:48,350
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I hate when these companies do this stuff, because they totally create patents for stuff that they don't imagine that they're not going to even use, just because they probably hear that some company is making something similar.

610
00:40:49,187 --> 00:40:51,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what if this did legitimately already exist?

611
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it looks like crap anyways.

612
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:59,094
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, looking at this right now, it looks like a TV remote.

613
00:41:00,295 --> 00:41:01,116
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it looks like.

614
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:08,061
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it has an infrared emitter inside the actual device.

615
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:10,183
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, controller, I guess.

616
00:41:10,303 --> 00:41:15,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a receiver that would be an infrared receiver.

617
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:15,347
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

618
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:25,433
[SPEAKER_04]: If anything, I would say that the people that created a TV remote would be able to sue over the Wii remote.

619
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:30,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's enough different with the two devices that they probably won't win.

620
00:41:30,595 --> 00:41:40,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now, it says here that, I'm reading through the complaint here, and this patent was filed by the other company on February 1st, 2005, long before anyone knew anything about the Wii, so...

621
00:41:41,621 --> 00:41:42,441
[SPEAKER_03]: True, though.

622
00:41:42,661 --> 00:41:45,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so it was filed 2005.

623
00:41:46,363 --> 00:41:53,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't mean, though, that they weren't... I'd want to see when the patent was filed for the Wii remote.

624
00:41:53,786 --> 00:41:56,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Because apparently the Wii has been in production for a long time.

625
00:41:59,068 --> 00:41:59,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

626
00:42:00,848 --> 00:42:01,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.

627
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:04,250
[SPEAKER_03]: You use it in operating the computer from far away.

628
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,411
[SPEAKER_03]: They made it for the computer.

629
00:42:06,451 --> 00:42:07,151
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably to...

630
00:42:08,843 --> 00:42:13,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one of those things that will let you run the PowerPoint shows from afar.

631
00:42:13,585 --> 00:42:14,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one at work.

632
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:17,727
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a TV remote, though, basically.

633
00:42:18,408 --> 00:42:20,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's basically what it is.

634
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:21,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

635
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, isn't that what a TV remote is?

636
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:28,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a DVD remote, for example.

637
00:42:28,232 --> 00:42:36,336
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be basically what it is, because I use the PlayStation 2 DVD remote to navigate menus and stuff.

638
00:42:36,836 --> 00:42:38,077
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very similar to this.

639
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:39,920
[SPEAKER_04]: It uses IR as well.

640
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:43,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think that they're too different.

641
00:42:43,523 --> 00:42:48,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is very similar to, say, a TV remote than it is, you know, the Wii remote.

642
00:42:49,248 --> 00:42:52,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Raven's Dolphin says the Wii trigger goes through Bluetooth, not infrared.

643
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:53,372
[SPEAKER_03]: They will lose.

644
00:42:54,332 --> 00:42:54,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

645
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:56,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

646
00:42:57,495 --> 00:43:06,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, these lawsuits that seemingly come out of nowhere when something gets popular, they make us angsty, and we get really angry about this stuff because we don't want anyone taking away our Wii.

647
00:43:07,256 --> 00:43:09,878
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means it's about time for the FUs of the week.

648
00:43:18,745 --> 00:43:22,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Since DarkSakura is not here tonight, Loki, you're going to have to start us off.

649
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:25,190
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to DarkSakura for not being here.

650
00:43:26,672 --> 00:43:27,432
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to the ferret.

651
00:43:31,255 --> 00:43:34,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say FU to RPM Racing because they're...

652
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:44,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 11 car had fucked up traction on it, so it kept slamming into the wall and I actually had to get pitted one lap because they black flagged me.

653
00:43:47,677 --> 00:43:52,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you to Rob for the fact that he keeps playing initial D music.

654
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:55,819
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pretty good FU music, I like this.

655
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:02,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, I would have to say... Gosh, I don't have a lot to be angsty about today.

656
00:44:02,923 --> 00:44:27,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say an FU to the rain and it being so cold out recently an FU to the fact that I'm spoiled by California weather so what's cold right now probably isn't really cold to other people so FU to the weather lately because it's been kind of crappy that's it, Miklatov left the room because he has a bad headache I guess DDR gave him a headache so Miklatov's not here to put in his FU so FU to headaches and Advil it doesn't work

657
00:44:29,662 --> 00:44:38,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's go into our next story, which is about the Spike TV VGAs, if I'm not mistaking.

658
00:44:40,308 --> 00:44:42,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you... Oh, these haven't aired yet, have they?

659
00:44:44,091 --> 00:44:45,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're going to air.

660
00:44:45,171 --> 00:44:50,514
[SPEAKER_03]: It taped on Friday, but it's going to air on, what, the 13th?

661
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:51,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

662
00:44:52,355 --> 00:44:52,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

663
00:44:54,683 --> 00:44:55,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoiler alert!

664
00:44:56,304 --> 00:44:57,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, spoiler alert.

665
00:44:57,304 --> 00:44:58,665
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to ruin it for you right now.

666
00:44:58,705 --> 00:45:00,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's who won at the Spike TV.

667
00:45:00,726 --> 00:45:03,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Game of the Year was Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.

668
00:45:04,607 --> 00:45:07,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Best Individual Sports Game was Tony Hawk Project 8.

669
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:10,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Best Team Sports Game was NBA 2K7.

670
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:15,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Best Song was Lights and Sounds by Yellowcard and Burnout Revenge.

671
00:45:15,272 --> 00:45:16,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo!

672
00:45:16,392 --> 00:45:16,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Why boo?

673
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:18,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Yellowcard sucks.

674
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:22,234
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, I like Today by Junkie XL way better.

675
00:45:22,495 --> 00:45:23,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see.

676
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:26,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Best Soundtrack was Guitar Hero 2.

677
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:28,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Studio of the Year was Epic Games.

678
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,523
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they give out a bunch of awards to actors and actresses.

679
00:45:31,663 --> 00:45:36,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they gave Best Supporting Male to James Gandolfini in The Sopranos.

680
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:38,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Best Supporting Female, Rachel Lee Cook.

681
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:39,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Kingdom Hearts 2.

682
00:45:40,236 --> 00:45:46,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamer's Choice for Breakthrough Performance, Rosario Dawson, and an award to Johnny Depp, just because he's Johnny Depp, I guess.

683
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:49,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamer's Choice is the guys that they gave to him.

684
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:51,219
[SPEAKER_03]: They just wanted Johnny Depp to show up at the award show.

685
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:51,919
[SPEAKER_03]: You know this is true.

686
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:52,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Bastard.

687
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:59,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we actually have someone on the line with us who actually attended the event and is going to tell us a little bit more about what happened on the inside.

688
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:04,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Orange Lounge Radio's very own DJ Tyrant from STFU.

689
00:46:04,483 --> 00:46:05,663
[SPEAKER_03]: You there, DJ Tyrant?

690
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:06,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, how's it going, guys?

691
00:46:06,924 --> 00:46:07,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, how are you doing?

692
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:09,339
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.

693
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,180
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is a little shot from yelling at the awards.

694
00:46:13,101 --> 00:46:13,961
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?

695
00:46:14,001 --> 00:46:17,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about how you got into the VGAs and how it all went down.

696
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:22,864
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an email from X-Fire and they had a thousand tickets to give out.

697
00:46:22,984 --> 00:46:25,925
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just showed up and they gave them to me.

698
00:46:27,445 --> 00:46:27,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.

699
00:46:27,865 --> 00:46:28,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

700
00:46:28,225 --> 00:46:31,166
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just went right in and got to see all this stuff?

701
00:46:31,186 --> 00:46:32,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there a lot of celebrities there?

702
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:35,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there were just a ton of celebrities.

703
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:39,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet the guys who do Mega64.com.

704
00:46:39,484 --> 00:46:40,184
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really cool.

705
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:45,606
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I met them at an E3 a couple years ago, and they seemed really offended I didn't know who they were.

706
00:46:46,466 --> 00:46:50,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know who they are now, but at the time they seemed really offended that I didn't know who they were.

707
00:46:50,988 --> 00:46:51,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, sorry.

708
00:46:52,748 --> 00:46:54,169
[SPEAKER_03]: But somebody explained it to me afterwards.

709
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:55,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, that Tetris video.

710
00:46:55,749 --> 00:46:56,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's kind of funny.

711
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,750
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, were they cool to you?

712
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,491
[SPEAKER_00]: They seemed pretty cool, yeah.

713
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:01,851
[SPEAKER_00]: They were...

714
00:47:02,762 --> 00:47:04,142
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pretty nice to me.

715
00:47:04,402 --> 00:47:06,423
[SPEAKER_03]: How about any A-list celebrities?

716
00:47:06,443 --> 00:47:11,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Mega64, with all due respect, is kind of like D, E-list, internet.

717
00:47:11,905 --> 00:47:13,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do internet celebrities go?

718
00:47:13,045 --> 00:47:13,945
[SPEAKER_03]: On the E-list somewhere?

719
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:19,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you meet Samuel L. Jackson or Tom Cruise?

720
00:47:19,287 --> 00:47:22,047
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to meet any of the A-list celebrities.

721
00:47:23,328 --> 00:47:24,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to hear that.

722
00:47:24,128 --> 00:47:25,628
[SPEAKER_03]: So why is your voice so hoarse?

723
00:47:25,688 --> 00:47:27,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you screaming and yelling and cheering at all these people?

724
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:32,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I was more booing at them than anything.

725
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:36,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So you were booing all the celebrities as they came out on stage?

726
00:47:37,775 --> 00:47:43,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as RavensDolphin1 says in chat, I did boo 50 Cent when he came to present an award.

727
00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:44,440
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you say to 50 Cent?

728
00:47:45,801 --> 00:47:47,142
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, your game sucks.

729
00:47:47,922 --> 00:47:48,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, it does.

730
00:47:50,904 --> 00:47:56,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anybody yell back, or could people actually hear you, or was it the place so huge they couldn't really hear you?

731
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:01,940
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some people in the first floor heard me and they laughed.

732
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,040
[SPEAKER_03]: So you were the heckler guy, huh?

733
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:06,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I was.

734
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:12,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading a little bit of back and forth that's going on on Destructoid.com because you made a comment.

735
00:48:12,402 --> 00:48:17,283
[SPEAKER_03]: You were talking about, in their comments, you were talking about how you yelled at 50 Cent, your game sucks.

736
00:48:17,863 --> 00:48:19,983
[SPEAKER_03]: His game did suck.

737
00:48:20,363 --> 00:48:24,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, DJ Tarrant wrote, booing yellow card saying, get off the stage, asshole.

738
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:28,553
[SPEAKER_03]: and yelled at Sarah Silverman, you're not funny.

739
00:48:29,914 --> 00:48:34,575
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I think this stuff is kind of funny, but then somebody replied to you, dude, you were a total ass.

740
00:48:34,635 --> 00:48:36,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I sat three rows behind you.

741
00:48:36,176 --> 00:48:37,976
[SPEAKER_03]: You were wearing a blue X-Fire shirt.

742
00:48:38,317 --> 00:48:40,317
[SPEAKER_03]: You were a huge asshole throughout the show.

743
00:48:40,537 --> 00:48:40,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Comments?

744
00:48:42,778 --> 00:48:44,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you a big asshole throughout the show?

745
00:48:45,279 --> 00:48:46,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I was.

746
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:47,480
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll admit that.

747
00:48:49,062 --> 00:48:51,364
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see how anyone can take it seriously, though.

748
00:48:52,225 --> 00:48:53,607
[SPEAKER_00]: The show, it's terrible.

749
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:54,487
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

750
00:48:54,628 --> 00:48:55,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's funny.

751
00:48:55,448 --> 00:48:56,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're right.

752
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:58,131
[SPEAKER_03]: All these celebrities are just coming out.

753
00:48:58,191 --> 00:49:00,213
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of them do you think actually play games?

754
00:49:00,573 --> 00:49:03,736
[SPEAKER_03]: How much of 50 Cent's game do you think he actually played?

755
00:49:04,117 --> 00:49:10,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these celebrities just show up to these events because they know it's something they can add to their resume and say that they were on TV.

756
00:49:12,345 --> 00:49:12,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

757
00:49:12,605 --> 00:49:12,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

758
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:14,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.

759
00:49:14,797 --> 00:49:19,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the guy who was Superman in Superman Returns, I can't think of his name.

760
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon Routh.

761
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:28,347
[SPEAKER_00]: He was obviously a big Warcraft fan when he introduced the World of Warcraft Burning Crusade video.

762
00:49:28,707 --> 00:49:31,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did he come out there and go, Leroy Jenkins?

763
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:32,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he do that?

764
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:39,615
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but he said he had played Warcraft 2 and mentioned a lot about how he liked Blizzard, so...

765
00:49:41,002 --> 00:49:49,725
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good to see at least one gamer out there.

766
00:49:50,245 --> 00:49:50,425
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

767
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:54,266
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I cheered for Gears of War.

768
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:57,867
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't played it, but they definitely deserve the respect.

769
00:49:59,547 --> 00:50:01,208
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good game if you're into first-person shooters.

770
00:50:01,288 --> 00:50:01,728
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good game.

771
00:50:02,308 --> 00:50:04,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, anything else you want to say about the award show?

772
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:08,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch it and see if you can hear me during it.

773
00:50:08,761 --> 00:50:11,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, they'll have muted you or bleeped you out.

774
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,423
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they don't air it live.

775
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:16,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're too chicken shit to air it live.

776
00:50:16,405 --> 00:50:25,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Because these celebrities' egos would be damaged if, heaven forbid, they could pick up in the background some a-hole in the bleachers, no offense, going, your game sucks.

777
00:50:27,852 --> 00:50:32,174
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're doing that post-editing right now, bleeping you out.

778
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:33,755
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably blurring your seat.

779
00:50:33,775 --> 00:50:34,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe they'll work hard.

780
00:50:35,056 --> 00:50:35,256
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

781
00:50:36,087 --> 00:50:37,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I made them work hard.

782
00:50:37,127 --> 00:50:37,588
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

783
00:50:37,608 --> 00:50:38,388
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that matters.

784
00:50:38,688 --> 00:50:38,988
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

785
00:50:39,488 --> 00:50:43,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, and BlackWolf in our chatroom says the crowd noise will be fake the entire show.

786
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:44,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Most likely.

787
00:50:45,771 --> 00:50:47,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a lot of thunderous applause?

788
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:49,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they have the lights that say, applause, applause?

789
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:52,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Or did they bring a girl on stage with big chi-chis?

790
00:50:53,594 --> 00:50:54,955
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of seat fillers, though.

791
00:50:55,555 --> 00:50:56,615
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of seat fillers?

792
00:50:56,635 --> 00:50:59,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

793
00:50:59,677 --> 00:51:02,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the people they pay to go fill in the celebrity seats when they go to the bathroom?

794
00:51:03,712 --> 00:51:06,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were all in the front row, it seemed like.

795
00:51:06,594 --> 00:51:07,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, huh?

796
00:51:08,055 --> 00:51:08,316
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

797
00:51:08,776 --> 00:51:10,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for the insider perspective.

798
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:12,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And hey, try to go to some more awards.

799
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:16,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, hey, if they do a G4ia this year, you definitely have to get in there and do some heckling, all right?

800
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:18,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see what I can do.

801
00:51:18,303 --> 00:51:18,643
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

802
00:51:18,884 --> 00:51:19,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much.

803
00:51:19,604 --> 00:51:22,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll plug your show so the kids know to listen.

804
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:29,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'll be giving away one of those Castlevania bonus sets this week on SCFU Thursday at 7 o'clock.

805
00:51:30,512 --> 00:51:31,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

806
00:51:31,653 --> 00:51:32,594
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 7 Pacific, right?

807
00:51:34,266 --> 00:51:34,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven Pacific.

808
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:35,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed, it is.

809
00:51:38,169 --> 00:51:38,450
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

810
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:41,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, DJ Tyrant, and we'll see you on Thursday for STFU.

811
00:51:42,573 --> 00:51:42,853
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

812
00:51:43,374 --> 00:51:43,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, guys.

813
00:51:44,815 --> 00:51:45,135
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

814
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:52,421
[SPEAKER_03]: That was our very own DJ Tyrant giving us the scoop on what went on at the Video Game Awards and how he was a big jerk.

815
00:51:52,802 --> 00:51:53,522
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

816
00:51:54,663 --> 00:51:56,284
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't take celebrities seriously.

817
00:51:56,885 --> 00:52:00,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if Britney Spears had come out, I would have yelled, you know, where's your panties?

818
00:52:00,608 --> 00:52:02,850
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because of all the pictures recently.

819
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:04,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, forget it.

820
00:52:05,281 --> 00:52:06,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywho, back to some news.

821
00:52:07,242 --> 00:52:18,632
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm starting to think we should really curb from now on any stories that are from an analyst.

822
00:52:19,332 --> 00:52:20,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously.

823
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:27,039
[SPEAKER_04]: The rumors come back up again from an analyst saying that Apple is entering the console market and they're

824
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:40,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Take on it is basically, we think that the video game market represents a distinct possibility for Apple, especially considering that it recently announced that the availability of video games for its iPod through the iTunes Store.

825
00:52:41,711 --> 00:52:43,132
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a reason!

826
00:52:43,192 --> 00:52:44,273
[SPEAKER_04]: That's stupid!

827
00:52:44,313 --> 00:52:45,774
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like, I don't get it.

828
00:52:45,934 --> 00:52:50,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Every fucking week on this program for the past almost five years, what do we sit here and do?

829
00:52:50,518 --> 00:52:52,500
[SPEAKER_03]: We sit here and analyze the game scene.

830
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,401
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we do.

831
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:55,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody's ever thrown money at us.

832
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

833
00:52:58,582 --> 00:53:03,630
[SPEAKER_03]: These financial... If I got a degree, would they throw money at us in whatever these people have a degree in?

834
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:04,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Market analysis or whatever?

835
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:09,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't even have to be... They're like the goddamn weatherman of the fucking...

836
00:53:10,433 --> 00:53:11,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

837
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what Apple is going to create next.

838
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:32,648
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to create their own line of sex toys.

839
00:53:32,688 --> 00:53:36,611
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have the Apple i-vibe or something like that.

840
00:53:37,031 --> 00:53:40,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, that is my analyst's take on this.

841
00:53:40,773 --> 00:53:44,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people like having fun, therefore they like being pleasured.

842
00:53:45,436 --> 00:53:46,056
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

843
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:48,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel the bass through the i-vibe.

844
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:51,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireboma calls it the i-braider.

845
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Eyebraider, whatever.

846
00:53:53,924 --> 00:53:56,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, this is how ridiculous these stories are.

847
00:53:56,728 --> 00:54:01,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I, for one, I will not be talking about any analyst crap from now on.

848
00:54:02,378 --> 00:54:05,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, do you think it's feasible, though, that Apple could do a console?

849
00:54:06,008 --> 00:54:07,369
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

850
00:54:27,146 --> 00:54:28,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Apple's going to do that in reverse.

851
00:54:29,068 --> 00:54:34,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're going to put this Trojan horse in as a movie device, and then, hey, it'll play Zuma and Bejeweled, too.

852
00:54:35,112 --> 00:54:35,472
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

853
00:54:36,093 --> 00:54:38,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be able to run much anything else.

854
00:54:38,595 --> 00:54:42,918
[SPEAKER_04]: And have you tried playing any of these games on the Apple iPod?

855
00:54:42,998 --> 00:54:43,939
[SPEAKER_04]: They suck.

856
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:47,241
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, seriously.

857
00:54:48,102 --> 00:54:55,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I hate to sound like the fucking Apple hater, but the Apple, I mean, their line of computers...

858
00:54:55,882 --> 00:54:56,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I will admit, I love my Mac.

859
00:55:06,414 --> 00:55:07,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my little Mac laptop.

860
00:55:07,895 --> 00:55:08,655
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

861
00:55:08,975 --> 00:55:11,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I consider myself bi when it comes to computers.

862
00:55:11,276 --> 00:55:12,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Apple sometimes.

863
00:55:12,596 --> 00:55:14,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I like PCs other days.

864
00:55:15,057 --> 00:55:21,659
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't exactly... When I think, hey, I'm going to go play some games on the computer, I don't exactly think about my Apple computer.

865
00:55:21,739 --> 00:55:22,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's nothing wrong with that.

866
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they could come out with a game console.

867
00:55:25,581 --> 00:55:31,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... I don't... I think it's too late in the game to come out with a new console right now.

868
00:55:31,443 --> 00:55:33,843
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think if they did it, it would fail.

869
00:55:34,024 --> 00:55:35,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be like, you know...

870
00:55:35,745 --> 00:55:37,125
[SPEAKER_04]: The Phantom, or something like that.

871
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:37,686
[SPEAKER_03]: The Pippin?

872
00:55:38,366 --> 00:55:41,787
[SPEAKER_03]: BlackWolf says, apparently Tetris works really well on an iPod.

873
00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:44,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I don't read.

874
00:55:44,648 --> 00:55:47,989
[SPEAKER_03]: My iPod was the old-ass black and white one, and it broke.

875
00:55:48,209 --> 00:55:52,050
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping I get gift certificates this Christmas so I can get myself a new one.

876
00:55:52,511 --> 00:55:56,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, but I heard Bejeweled blew ass, though, and that's the thing.

877
00:55:57,236 --> 00:55:58,056
[SPEAKER_03]: So great.

878
00:55:58,156 --> 00:56:01,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end of the day, it's bejeweled again.

879
00:56:01,217 --> 00:56:07,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, you can't take this seriously as a console unless there's new things to breathe life into these consoles.

880
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:08,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

881
00:56:08,578 --> 00:56:13,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I will admit, there was one time, you know, with Apple II, that they had good games on there.

882
00:56:13,419 --> 00:56:20,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, you had some pretty good stuff on the Apple II, but that day is long past.

883
00:56:20,561 --> 00:56:20,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

884
00:56:23,905 --> 00:56:24,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Little Britain

885
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a show that's run in the UK and also on BBC America.

886
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:58,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's on BBC America here.

887
00:56:58,656 --> 00:56:59,617
[SPEAKER_03]: DVDs do very well here, too.

888
00:56:59,637 --> 00:57:04,901
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a parody of Life in Britain, and they've got a bunch of different characters in there.

889
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,184
[SPEAKER_04]: It almost reminds me a little bit of a modern take on, say...

890
00:57:11,331 --> 00:57:11,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Monty Python

891
00:57:29,105 --> 00:57:30,927
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty funny looking from what I've seen so far.

892
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,048
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell are you going to do with the Little Britain game?

893
00:57:33,068 --> 00:57:36,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong, I love the show, but I can't really picture it as a game.

894
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:40,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, are you going to go around yelling, I am the only game in the village?

895
00:57:40,674 --> 00:57:48,020
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was funny that you mentioned that, because actually that was one of the advertisements on the story.

896
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,902
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, you know, I am the only game in the village.

897
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:56,546
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's actually one, though, one scene that I saw where you're riding around...

898
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:04,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to basically scare away the other gays that are in the village so that you can become the only gay in the village.

899
00:58:05,823 --> 00:58:06,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.

900
00:58:06,623 --> 00:58:09,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically going to be a collection of minigames.

901
00:58:09,504 --> 00:58:14,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there going to be a music game for rap for the one girl that goes, No, but yeah, but yeah, but yeah.

902
00:58:15,067 --> 00:58:17,088
[SPEAKER_03]: You know her that tells all the stories and stuff?

903
00:58:17,588 --> 00:58:24,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, anyways, so the game is going to be, like I said, a collection of minigames presented in the format of an episode of the TV show.

904
00:58:24,451 --> 00:58:25,592
[SPEAKER_04]: And since players can enter...

905
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:36,028
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get interactive with their favorite sketch show characters in a series of eight minigames featuring Lou and Andy, Vicky Pillard, Mr. Man, Emily and Florence,

906
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:48,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Majore Dawes, Daphne Thomas, Judy and Maggie, and Letty.

907
00:58:49,368 --> 00:58:52,492
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, each minigame plays like a sketch from the TV show.

908
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:57,799
[SPEAKER_04]: To win the game, players must progress through all the sketches to the end of the show, or the credits will roll.

909
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,021
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um,

910
00:59:00,046 --> 00:59:02,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, they have... And that's coming out here in America, too?

911
00:59:02,588 --> 00:59:03,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

912
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:04,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's only in the UK.

913
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,952
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out on PC.

914
00:59:06,012 --> 00:59:07,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, because you won't even be able to import that.

915
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:08,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, if it's PC, you can.

916
00:59:08,734 --> 00:59:10,877
[SPEAKER_04]: PC, PlayStation Portable.

917
00:59:11,057 --> 00:59:12,398
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get the PlayStation Portable version.

918
00:59:12,418 --> 00:59:12,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, okay, cool.

919
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And PlayStation 2.

920
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,824
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation 2 and PC versions will be out January 22nd.

921
00:59:20,866 --> 00:59:23,188
[SPEAKER_04]: and then May for the PSP version.

922
00:59:23,228 --> 00:59:26,430
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can import the PSP one, which might be fun.

923
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:28,311
[SPEAKER_03]: What's his name from Buffy in it?

924
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:29,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthony Stewart Head?

925
00:59:29,512 --> 00:59:29,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that his name?

926
00:59:29,992 --> 00:59:30,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he in it?

927
00:59:30,873 --> 00:59:31,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

928
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:34,215
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've got examples here.

929
00:59:34,535 --> 00:59:35,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a screenshot.

930
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:37,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Really great radio here.

931
00:59:37,497 --> 00:59:40,099
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's one of the minigames where you're smashing objects.

932
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:41,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

933
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

934
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:44,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Smashing frogs, it looks like.

935
00:59:45,403 --> 00:59:46,743
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

936
00:59:47,124 --> 00:59:47,804
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be funny.

937
00:59:49,425 --> 00:59:49,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

938
00:59:51,161 --> 00:59:52,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it'll be a good game.

939
00:59:53,962 --> 00:59:58,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywho, so, kind of moving on to a completely different topic here.

940
00:59:58,884 --> 01:00:00,224
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox 360.

941
01:00:00,524 --> 01:00:02,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we know that it has an HD DVD drive.

942
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:04,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what?

943
01:00:04,866 --> 01:00:10,048
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be, people are using it to copy HD DVDs to rip them to their PC.

944
01:00:10,928 --> 01:00:19,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the HD DVD drive uses a USB port and a connection, or USB connection, and can be, you know, you can do the

945
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:33,485
[SPEAKER_04]: 1080p connection over component cables, you can actually use a video capture card to capture that and then dump it, of course, to your hard drive for backup purposes only, of course.

946
01:00:34,085 --> 01:00:38,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you know, the PlayStation 3, I think, does the same thing with Blu-ray.

947
01:00:38,967 --> 01:00:41,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

948
01:00:41,368 --> 01:00:48,651
[SPEAKER_04]: But later on, I suppose, when they're going to require the HDMI cables, that might be able to circumvent some of this stuff.

949
01:00:48,691 --> 01:00:49,271
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now,

950
01:00:50,263 --> 01:00:52,564
[SPEAKER_04]: You can dump them via that.

951
01:00:52,924 --> 01:00:53,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

952
01:00:53,664 --> 01:00:55,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure this has the movie industry so excited.

953
01:00:56,585 --> 01:00:56,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

954
01:00:57,045 --> 01:01:00,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's their own fault that they couldn't figure out a way to encrypt it.

955
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:04,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I still don't know what movies I really want on HD DVD.

956
01:01:04,628 --> 01:01:06,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm still waiting for the format to kind of take off.

957
01:01:06,749 --> 01:01:07,569
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing, too.

958
01:01:07,689 --> 01:01:10,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there was a movie that I wanted, but it's only on Blu-ray.

959
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:12,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

960
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:12,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's annoying.

961
01:01:12,991 --> 01:01:14,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're going to get a PlayStation 3 eventually, right?

962
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:15,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

963
01:01:16,092 --> 01:01:16,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

964
01:01:17,012 --> 01:01:17,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

965
01:01:19,193 --> 01:01:19,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

966
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:24,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I got berated by the wife because she's like, I thought you said you weren't going to get one of those.

967
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:29,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, but you just got excited about the, you know, Motorstorm games, so.

968
01:01:30,382 --> 01:01:34,604
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, moving on to some ads that were about the PlayStation 3.

969
01:01:34,845 --> 01:01:42,750
[SPEAKER_03]: They were run by Circuit City, and Joystick picked up some of these Circuit City ads, running it under the headline, Circuit City Faults or Stupid Advertising?

970
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:43,330
[SPEAKER_03]: You decide.

971
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:49,334
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, again, on Joystick with a Q dot com, which is interesting because they talk about some things from the catalog that,

972
01:01:50,466 --> 01:01:52,989
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 3, Ready to Rumble, It's Hot

973
01:02:12,036 --> 01:02:16,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you have a wired controller, the Xbox Guide button glows green with what player you're in.

974
01:02:16,998 --> 01:02:20,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, of course, in the picture, obviously it's posed.

975
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're not really playing the game.

976
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,301
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't too hard to figure out.

977
01:02:23,381 --> 01:02:29,903
[SPEAKER_03]: But, of course, the anal gamer will notice that the lights are off, and so, in fact, the controllers are not plugged in.

978
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:34,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see the one with the Wii, though, on there?

979
01:02:34,525 --> 01:02:35,605
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I missed that one.

980
01:02:36,432 --> 01:02:45,897
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a picture with the Wii saying that the Wii can be played without a TV because it has a built-in projector into it.

981
01:02:47,438 --> 01:02:47,778
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

982
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:49,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm serious.

983
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that one of the old rumors about the Wii?

984
01:02:52,841 --> 01:02:58,704
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of the old rumors, but that's how... Somebody did not get the memo.

985
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:04,868
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really bad, but... How does this...

986
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:06,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Get through.

987
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, how does this get by without people noticing this stuff?

988
01:03:12,123 --> 01:03:12,763
[SPEAKER_04]: So seriously.

989
01:03:13,544 --> 01:03:18,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's no gamers that work at Circuit City's proofreading department?

990
01:03:18,386 --> 01:03:19,186
[SPEAKER_04]: No, here it is right here.

991
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:22,088
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually, take a look at the story again.

992
01:03:22,528 --> 01:03:33,313
[SPEAKER_04]: It says the USB port lets you plug in the game system to a project and play, or to project and play on awesome 11 and a half foot widescreen.

993
01:03:34,033 --> 01:03:34,774
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was for the Wii.

994
01:03:34,794 --> 01:03:34,994
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

995
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:38,011
[SPEAKER_04]: That might actually be for the 360.

996
01:03:39,572 --> 01:03:40,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, it's still wrong.

997
01:03:41,453 --> 01:03:42,334
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

998
01:03:43,955 --> 01:03:52,421
[SPEAKER_03]: No, yeah, it says the turned-off Xbox 360 controller is playing Madden on a projection television supposedly attached to the Xbox 360 by a USB cable.

999
01:03:54,203 --> 01:03:54,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1000
01:03:56,564 --> 01:03:56,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1001
01:03:57,605 --> 01:03:59,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously all that stuff's posed, you know.

1002
01:04:00,187 --> 01:04:01,968
[SPEAKER_03]: People read a little bit too much into that stuff.

1003
01:04:02,649 --> 01:04:05,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you may not be able to actually...

1004
01:04:06,398 --> 01:04:33,859
[SPEAKER_04]: have a projector built into your Xbox 360 or Wii but you can make your own Power Glove and that's what someone's done actually they have modified a Power Glove to put a black Wii remote on it and they've captured the hearts of geeks everywhere for about five minutes until the next video comes out with something else even more shinier I don't know it's

1005
01:04:34,377 --> 01:04:37,139
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid, but I'm sure someone was bound to do it at some point.

1006
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:42,182
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure someone has commented on this video, It's so bad.

1007
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:49,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see how many posts it took to say it's so bad.

1008
01:04:50,207 --> 01:04:52,268
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I am actually surprised.

1009
01:04:52,888 --> 01:04:53,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, oh.

1010
01:04:54,509 --> 01:04:55,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight posts.

1011
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:55,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight posts.

1012
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:56,251
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1013
01:04:56,511 --> 01:04:56,871
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1014
01:04:58,139 --> 01:05:02,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of things that are so bad, this is so bad it's good.

1015
01:05:02,341 --> 01:05:03,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean like so awesome.

1016
01:05:03,561 --> 01:05:04,542
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, bad meaning good.

1017
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:05,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Get this.

1018
01:05:06,643 --> 01:05:10,804
[SPEAKER_03]: The DS Lite has some new decals being made for it.

1019
01:05:10,844 --> 01:05:14,486
[SPEAKER_03]: You can turn your DS Lite, you know, you can use the decals to change your DS Lite.

1020
01:05:14,866 --> 01:05:17,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're being sold by Sanrio.

1021
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:18,167
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1022
01:05:18,567 --> 01:05:19,988
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make your DS Lite...

1023
01:05:20,407 --> 01:05:22,689
[SPEAKER_03]: The Hello Kitty DS Lite.

1024
01:05:22,969 --> 01:05:24,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, how fun is that going to be?

1025
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:31,976
[SPEAKER_03]: For the low, low price of 680 yen, that's about $5.90, you can get this from Sanrio.

1026
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:33,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so awesome.

1027
01:05:33,357 --> 01:05:36,039
[SPEAKER_03]: And they look best, by the way, on the pink DSs, just so you know.

1028
01:05:36,859 --> 01:05:37,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Goody.

1029
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Just more reason for me to get a pink DS Lite this Christmas.

1030
01:05:41,343 --> 01:05:45,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, those pink DS Lites are going for a lot of money, actually, on eBay from what I've been hearing.

1031
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:45,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1032
01:05:45,886 --> 01:05:47,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, my customers... Aren't they still in stock in most places?

1033
01:05:48,108 --> 01:05:48,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1034
01:05:49,173 --> 01:05:50,693
[SPEAKER_04]: eBay people are selling out of them quick.

1035
01:05:50,933 --> 01:05:51,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1036
01:05:51,794 --> 01:05:56,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, apparently Canada is blinging up your DS stylus.

1037
01:05:57,915 --> 01:06:05,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Future Shop, you can actually purchase a 18 karat gold stylus for the low, low price of $19.99.

1038
01:06:05,817 --> 01:06:12,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And wow, Neil, that would really suck if you lost that one because...

1039
01:06:13,979 --> 01:06:15,680
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1040
01:06:35,017 --> 01:06:38,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well something else I'm sure people are going to be paying a lot of money for.

1041
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:40,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends if they decide to charge for this or not.

1042
01:06:41,021 --> 01:06:47,505
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a huge, rabid fan base around the television show that used to be on the air called Firefly.

1043
01:06:47,965 --> 01:06:50,506
[SPEAKER_03]: And you might remember they made it into a movie as well called Serenity.

1044
01:06:51,047 --> 01:06:56,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really follow the TV show, but Extifer, my roommate, is a huge weed and whore.

1045
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,051
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Buffy and Angel and all that.

1046
01:06:58,365 --> 01:07:01,146
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got dragged to see Serenity the day it opened, and it wasn't bad.

1047
01:07:01,326 --> 01:07:02,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty good.

1048
01:07:02,746 --> 01:07:05,647
[SPEAKER_03]: If I did get an HD DVD player, I would buy Serenity.

1049
01:07:06,107 --> 01:07:10,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Serenity would be a good movie for HD, or any sci-fi movie, really, would be a good HD movie.

1050
01:07:10,148 --> 01:07:11,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not what I'm reporting on.

1051
01:07:11,409 --> 01:07:16,610
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm talking about is that this has been licensed for an MMO.

1052
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:23,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Multiverse has struck a deal with Fox to put the Firefly property into the MMO ring.

1053
01:07:23,612 --> 01:07:25,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, keep in mind, this is very early on.

1054
01:07:25,592 --> 01:07:27,673
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no development team yet put together like this.

1055
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:32,988
[SPEAKER_03]: But they want to do a type of Star Wars Galaxy type game.

1056
01:07:33,308 --> 01:07:37,490
[SPEAKER_03]: But they say they will make it unique and fun and interesting.

1057
01:07:37,891 --> 01:07:39,531
[SPEAKER_03]: So it probably won't happen until 2008.

1058
01:07:40,812 --> 01:07:42,713
[SPEAKER_03]: But that could be very interesting.

1059
01:07:42,733 --> 01:07:47,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's certainly a huge fan base out there that will at least check this out for Curiosity Factor alone.

1060
01:07:47,835 --> 01:07:48,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't you think?

1061
01:07:48,836 --> 01:07:49,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

1062
01:07:49,916 --> 01:07:52,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd even check it out, even though I don't know much about the series.

1063
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:54,698
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, Space Cowboys.

1064
01:07:54,919 --> 01:07:55,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's...

1065
01:07:56,092 --> 01:07:56,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely unique.

1066
01:07:56,993 --> 01:07:59,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And who doesn't love cowboys in outer space?

1067
01:07:59,434 --> 01:08:01,895
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta love the fact that the show's been cancelled.

1068
01:08:02,776 --> 01:08:06,098
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and the series has been cancelled and it's not coming back.

1069
01:08:06,118 --> 01:08:07,719
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not going to be a sequel to Serenity.

1070
01:08:07,739 --> 01:08:09,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but isn't that what happened to Star Trek?

1071
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,662
[SPEAKER_03]: The original Star Trek got cancelled pretty early on and then they made a movie and it became huge.

1072
01:08:13,742 --> 01:08:18,285
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, Serenity unfortunately did not quite have a huge box office success.

1073
01:08:18,305 --> 01:08:19,826
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have called it Firefly the movie.

1074
01:08:20,706 --> 01:08:21,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, oh well.

1075
01:08:23,078 --> 01:08:26,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that's our last story for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

1076
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:38,284
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't go anywhere because we're going to be back very soon for Orange Lounge Radio Part B. And if you are a podcast listener, you just have to wait a couple days for Orange Lounge Radio Part B. We'll see you then when that's out.

1077
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:43,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1078
01:08:44,406 --> 01:08:48,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
