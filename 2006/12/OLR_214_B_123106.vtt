00:25.240 --> 00:30.860
on into the year 2007, weíre bringing on some special guests from all across the independent

00:30.860 --> 00:35.840
gaming voice community, we have some bloggers and other podcasters and folks who do other

00:35.840 --> 00:40.360
live shows and even dipping in and having some guests from the sci-fi and geek world

00:40.360 --> 00:44.120
coming in as well and thatís where our next guest comes from, yes, Dark Sakura?

00:44.120 --> 00:53.880
Definitely comes from geek world, this is Travis from Travis Donovan Live.

00:53.880 --> 00:58.520
Alright everybody, help me welcome Travis from Travis Donovan Live to the program, Travis

00:58.520 --> 00:59.520
you there?

00:59.520 --> 01:00.520
Yeah, me here.

01:00.520 --> 01:01.520
How you doing Travis?

01:01.520 --> 01:06.840
Surviving, Iím sitting here in the dark with my pants down.

01:06.840 --> 01:11.200
Hey now, this is a family show, what the heck is going on there, where youíre at, youíre

01:11.200 --> 01:12.700
in Texas right?

01:12.700 --> 01:18.100
We are in Texas and right now we are experiencing typical Texas weather.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.100
Which means?

01:20.100 --> 01:22.440
Thunderstorm warning, tornado watch.

01:22.440 --> 01:23.440
Oh fun.

01:23.440 --> 01:24.920
And no power.

01:24.920 --> 01:27.760
No video games for you then today?

01:27.760 --> 01:29.560
No and I just got my Wii today.

01:29.560 --> 01:34.160
Oh no, how did you finally get a Wii?

01:34.160 --> 01:41.840
With two EB games of all places and just randomly after stopping at GameStop and asked GameStop

01:41.840 --> 01:47.040
first and they said no, they had PS3 then, but now Wii just went to EB Games and said

01:47.040 --> 01:48.040
hey do you got a Wii?

01:48.040 --> 01:53.120
And the guy just looked at me and went ìyeahî and I said ìhook me up my brotherî.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.120
Some stroke of luck.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.120
What games did you get for your Wii?

01:56.120 --> 02:01.760
I got Raymond, the rabid one that everybody hates.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.960
Weíve heard some pretty good things about that from some of the other guests weíve

02:03.960 --> 02:05.460
had on the program.

02:05.460 --> 02:08.560
I figure if everyone else hates it then Iím going to love it.

02:08.560 --> 02:12.880
Alright, well then we definitely want to know your opinion on some of the best and worst

02:12.880 --> 02:17.400
in 2006 because if your opinion is the opposite then that should be kind of interesting.

02:17.400 --> 02:22.960
So we have ten boxes left, please pick a box, one through ten.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.320
Alright weíll go with lucky number seven.

02:25.320 --> 02:32.160
Lucky number seven, here we go, letís open the box and the category we want to know your

02:32.160 --> 02:36.680
opinion on is best game to play online.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.280
What was the best game to play online in 2006?

02:39.280 --> 02:44.320
Well thatís going to be difficult seeing how I didnít play a lot online and it would

02:44.320 --> 02:46.320
have been 360 only.

02:46.320 --> 02:52.000
Iím going to take a book or a page from my family here and Iím going to go with what

02:52.000 --> 02:58.400
they play online all the time and it has to unfortunately be the soul-stealing Final Fantasy.

02:58.400 --> 03:02.120
Final Fantasy XI then on 360, right?

03:02.120 --> 03:04.400
Yes, well no, on PC.

03:04.400 --> 03:08.520
Oh theyíre still playing PC, well weíre going to have to say the 360 version because

03:08.520 --> 03:11.720
the PC one came out a couple of years ago but the 360 one was this year.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.880
Okay well then let me change my damn answer.

03:14.880 --> 03:18.160
Alright, alright, alright, what then?

03:18.160 --> 03:21.840
Best game this year to play online, oh what the hell.

03:21.840 --> 03:22.840
Gears of War.

03:22.840 --> 03:30.320
Gears of War, very popular choice, any particular reason why you chose Gears of War?

03:30.320 --> 03:35.720
I have it for the 360 and I played it online like twice and it was fun.

03:35.720 --> 03:36.880
Have you played the co-op mode?

03:36.880 --> 03:40.840
I hear a lot of people, I think the reason why a lot of folks really enjoy Gears of War

03:40.840 --> 03:45.440
is because of the co-op and not a lot of games encourage co-op.

03:45.440 --> 03:49.480
No because nobody on my friends list bothers to play.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.960
I would play with you Travis at some point.

03:51.960 --> 03:56.240
Okay thatís just kinky and wrong.

03:56.240 --> 04:00.520
Alright then fine, the choice stands as it is and Iím not going to play online with

04:00.520 --> 04:01.520
you.

04:01.520 --> 04:05.000
Alright well then how about this news topic, Iíd be very curious to know your opinion

04:05.000 --> 04:11.040
on this, earlier this year there was a TV station that used to represent gamers a long

04:11.040 --> 04:16.100
time ago that changed their slogan earlier this year and that was G4 Television and their

04:16.100 --> 04:19.960
new slogan as of earlier this year was ìWe Get Guysî.

04:19.960 --> 04:24.280
You ever watch a G4 TV Travis?

04:24.280 --> 04:30.240
Unfortunately I have accidentally stumbled upon it because on my channel listing itís

04:30.240 --> 04:36.320
awfully close to BBC America and stuff like that so I accidentally tuned into it.

04:36.320 --> 04:41.720
I see, did you ever watch G4 Tech TV back in the day right when they first merged?

04:41.720 --> 04:46.640
In its heyday, well actually before it merged, Tech TV was the bomb.

04:46.640 --> 04:51.160
It was the ìshiz nitî as they say in the ghetto.

04:51.160 --> 04:55.120
It was the best thing for geeks and gamers out there.

04:55.120 --> 04:59.520
Then when G4 took over it was fine, it was okay, there were some bumps in the road but

04:59.520 --> 05:05.440
unfortunately now it is what I like to call a partial birth abortion of a network.

05:05.440 --> 05:08.400
What happened, what went wrong?

05:08.400 --> 05:14.520
They have no idea or concept of how to program a network around gaming and technology.

05:14.520 --> 05:23.080
Theyíre too ratings conscious and unfortunately they have a talent pool which makes a West

05:23.080 --> 05:29.120
Virginia gene pool look like genius status.

05:29.120 --> 05:33.240
Do you think that thereís a need out there for a video game network or do you think online

05:33.240 --> 05:36.640
kind of fills that void?

05:36.640 --> 05:38.080
The internet of course fills it.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.080
It fills it extremely well.

05:40.080 --> 05:45.840
There are tons of sources whether youíve got your GameSpot, your IGN, your 1UP, your

05:45.840 --> 05:49.840
joystick, whatever.

05:49.840 --> 05:56.080
Print wise, magazine wise you also have a plethora of magazines you can buy.

05:56.080 --> 06:01.360
Television wise it would be good to have somebody or a network that wasnít jockeyed one way

06:01.360 --> 06:10.600
or the other by advertising dollars to sort of twist their slant on gaming in the industry

06:10.600 --> 06:16.760
because Iíll tell you right now you can tell on G4 that the almighty dollar really does

06:16.760 --> 06:20.120
affect some of what they say on that network.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.440
Iím not a big fan of that network.

06:23.440 --> 06:29.360
I think what theyíve done to my holy grail which is Star Trek is ridiculous and stupid

06:29.360 --> 06:37.880
with that whole 2.0 shit, pardon my English, and now theyíre showing cops.

06:37.880 --> 06:38.880
Iím sorry.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.520
Cops are going to be onÖ

06:40.520 --> 06:45.400
I was flipping the other day and I saw cops on there and I was like wow, itís very interesting.

06:45.400 --> 06:51.920
Why do you think then people continue to in the gaming world care about G4 because I noticed

06:51.920 --> 06:57.320
that once in a while game blogs and game sites run these stories on G4 television and I canít

06:57.320 --> 07:00.800
help but personally wonder and I know weíve talked about it on our own program previously,

07:00.800 --> 07:05.760
why do people continue to care if G4 is not giving the gamer world what we need?

07:05.760 --> 07:10.080
Why is the gamer world continuing to give them free press?

07:10.080 --> 07:15.600
So long as you have any type of mass media outlet, everybody is going to try to take

07:15.600 --> 07:20.880
advantage of as many of those outlets as possible and G4 is one of those.

07:20.880 --> 07:29.360
You have the talking heads on that network which are there to shield their products and

07:29.360 --> 07:34.680
thatís why people still care unfortunately about G4.

07:34.680 --> 07:44.280
I give G4 credit to be one of the very few Americanized networks that actually employ

07:44.280 --> 07:57.560
a shemale, Morgan Webb, and a spasmatic schizo with severe bipolar disorder, Adam Sessler,

07:57.560 --> 08:03.920
and the rest of their lineup and I love how they steal British interactive television

08:03.920 --> 08:11.040
game shows and claim them as their own, i.e. that late night video game or that game call-in

08:11.040 --> 08:22.800
show that they do which is a steal from a British show that they do over there.

08:22.800 --> 08:26.800
So long as theyíre on the air, game companies will use them as an outlet to shield their

08:26.800 --> 08:34.240
products because the attention span of the American public is that of a fruit fly.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.240
Theyíll get their media anywhere they can.

08:37.240 --> 08:41.080
We here at Orange Lounge have given them too much airtime as it is so we need to move right

08:41.080 --> 08:42.080
on to the next topic.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.800
But thank you for your input.

08:43.800 --> 08:49.200
What did you think was the best video game of 2006, weíre tallying it up tonight?

08:49.200 --> 08:54.560
The best game of 2006, again, Iím going to fall back on is Gears of War just because

08:54.560 --> 08:59.600
it took the first person shooter, it really didnít ratchet up a notch as far as the style

08:59.600 --> 09:07.240
of gameplay, itís still the same run, duck, cover, shoot, but the graphics quality, I

09:07.240 --> 09:12.800
think itís the first true game of 2006 to take advantage of the next gen console and

09:12.800 --> 09:16.720
itís going to be interesting to see how this plays out with the other next gen console,

09:16.720 --> 09:17.720
the PS3.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.920
I donít throw the ìweî into the category of next gen because graphics-wise itís the

09:21.920 --> 09:27.000
same but the 360 and the PS3, youíre finally seeing the developers get a hold of this and

09:27.000 --> 09:28.520
Iím looking forward to 2007.

09:28.520 --> 09:33.360
I think ìweî tries to classify itself more as a ìnew genî than ìnext genî, so it

09:33.360 --> 09:35.760
could be interesting to see how that all plays out.

09:35.760 --> 09:36.760
It is.

09:36.760 --> 09:40.560
I mean, the ìweî is definitely revolutionary and it is going to be fun to play and itís

09:40.560 --> 09:43.040
going to be innovative and itís going to be fun to see how publishers take advantage

09:43.040 --> 09:44.040
of that as well.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.320
All right, what was your worst game of 2006?

09:46.320 --> 09:49.840
Oh, God, we donít have enough time on the show.

09:49.840 --> 10:01.440
Iím going to go from a standpoint of a letdown as far as genre is concerned and that would

10:01.440 --> 10:03.040
have to be Star Trek Legacy.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.320
Ooh, wow, why is Star Trek Legacy?

10:06.320 --> 10:15.940
The single-player story missions are incredible and theyíre fun and the graphics are great

10:15.940 --> 10:20.880
and itís great that you have the voice of all the captains and that partís wonderful.

10:20.880 --> 10:26.720
Whatís killing this game from being as hot as Bridge Commander was on the PC, and as

10:26.720 --> 10:31.480
I went into it on my show, is the multiplayer.

10:31.480 --> 10:34.360
The multiplayer on this game literally sucks.

10:34.360 --> 10:41.320
I mean, it sucks big floppy donkey dongs, so half the time you canít even get into

10:41.320 --> 10:48.000
a game, you get kicked out, the connections are horrid, the lag times are not bad when

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
you finally get a game, but the problem is getting a game.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.520
You think itís possible maybe the developers will push a patch out that hopefully will

10:55.520 --> 10:57.080
fix some of it?

10:57.080 --> 11:03.160
Well, they were quick to push a patch out for the multiplayer on the PC.

11:03.160 --> 11:08.840
They literally had that out the same day it was released on PC, but Legacy was a port

11:08.840 --> 11:14.240
from 360 to PC, so that was because they were having problems with GameSpy and GameSpy is

11:14.240 --> 11:18.040
well known for having compatibility issues with games anyways.

11:18.040 --> 11:23.600
But if there was going to be a patch, it would have been out by now and I donít think.

11:23.600 --> 11:28.640
I think Bethesda Soft is just taking CBS Biocomís money and saying, ìHere, we gave you three

11:28.640 --> 11:36.200
games, thank you for the money, good luck and thanks for all the fish,î kind of thing.

11:36.200 --> 11:41.560
I know Star Trek is something near and dear to your heart because you do the sci-fi program

11:41.560 --> 11:44.680
here on Orange on Saturday night, yes?

11:44.680 --> 11:47.480
Not so much sci-fi anymore, but yes.

11:47.480 --> 11:51.800
What exactly can the fans expect to hear when they tune into Travis Donovan Live on Saturdays?

11:51.800 --> 11:56.560
Thatís great, being the station manager and such as you are, keeping up to speed with

11:56.560 --> 12:00.320
the shows, Rob.

12:00.320 --> 12:07.640
I do throw a little sci-fi and geek into it, of course, but Iím now getting to the point

12:07.640 --> 12:12.880
where Iím so pissed off with the morons in television and the morons on the internet

12:12.880 --> 12:18.640
totally infecting reality that itís time that reality gets put back in its place and

12:18.640 --> 12:20.240
thatís what my showís all about.

12:20.240 --> 12:26.200
Itís enough of hearing about Britney Spearsí coup and Lindsay Lohanís drunken tirades.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.680
Itís time to slap people upside the head with a large fish and get them to realize

12:30.680 --> 12:32.440
thereís more important things in this world.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.000
So youíre the angry geek?

12:34.000 --> 12:40.120
Iím the angry, pissed off, motherfucking, hetero white middle-aged man.

12:40.120 --> 12:45.280
Well, Iím not so much middle-aged, but for your listeners, I would be considered middle-aged.

12:45.280 --> 12:52.440
Itís sort of what Travis Donovan Live is all about now.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.200
The tagline is putting reality back in its place.

12:55.200 --> 12:59.320
What are you looking forward to most in the geek world in 2007?

12:59.320 --> 13:02.120
Not necessarily games, but anything.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.120
Anything geek?

13:03.120 --> 13:10.440
Well, Iím interested to see how well Vista plays out when Windows Vista releases, how

13:10.440 --> 13:12.680
well of an operating system thatís going to be.

13:12.680 --> 13:17.280
Is it just going to be fancy new graphics and user interface, or is it actually going

13:17.280 --> 13:22.960
to be something substantial, because nowadays itís so easy to steal information and corrupt

13:22.960 --> 13:24.520
data via the internet.

13:24.520 --> 13:30.760
Iím just wondering how much more secure Vista is going to be.

13:30.760 --> 13:35.040
Itís already been hacked, from what I understand, so thatís not a good sign.

13:35.040 --> 13:39.080
The rest of technology, thatís up in the air right now.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.960
Things are moving at such a pace.

13:40.960 --> 13:44.080
Itís always fun to see what the Japanese bring out.

13:44.080 --> 13:50.080
They bring out robots to help the invalid, so Iím hoping soon theyíll bring out a robot

13:50.080 --> 13:53.400
thatíll help wipe my butt, because again, Iím a lazy American and I donít like to

13:53.400 --> 13:56.000
do that.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.160
On that note, I think we should probably say goodbye.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.720
Thanks so much for being on the program tonight.

14:01.720 --> 14:02.720
Oh, good.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.920
Letís end the call on the brown note.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.560
Thatís great.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.480
Or as weíve called it on the show previously, the brown eye of judgment.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.600
We should have to go back to the archives for that one.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.800
TravisDonovanLive.com for more information on the program.

14:16.800 --> 14:21.080
Saturday nights here on Orange Launch Radio, and podcasts on your own site too, yes?

14:21.080 --> 14:23.480
Oh my God, you remembered the URL.

14:23.480 --> 14:24.480
I did.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.480
Pay attention.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.040
I podcast via my site.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.400
Iím also on iTunes.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.000
Search him out, Travis Donovan.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.320
Thanks so much for being here, and best of luck to you in í07.

14:35.320 --> 14:36.320
No problem.

14:36.320 --> 14:44.120
Hopefully itíll be great.

14:44.120 --> 14:48.760
For those that donít know, if you go way, way back in the broadcast history of myself

14:48.760 --> 14:52.760
in Dark Sakura, we actually started on a show with Travis.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.680
He did a long time ago called Understation Alive, and heís still pretty funny after

14:55.680 --> 14:57.600
all these many, many, many years.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.360
I was the fill-in person slash most frequent guest.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.720
Yes, and I was the gay guy that was on the show, I guess.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.360
I donít know what the hell my role was there, but we didnít get to talk a lot of games

15:07.360 --> 15:08.800
back then.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.640
I remember one of the biggest interviews we ever had is we interviewed the guy who ran

15:12.640 --> 15:15.000
the bunny ranch on our program.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.360
I remember making the calls to pay phones in Disneyland.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.360
So that was a weird show.

15:20.360 --> 15:23.600
That was kind of a shock job kind of show.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.720
How did the pay phone calls go?

15:25.720 --> 15:26.720
Someone answered one.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.720
We did get one.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.840
From what I remember, we had somebody answer it once, and we actually had a conversation

15:30.840 --> 15:35.160
with them, but then we called back and the call mysteriously dropped, and we were theorizing

15:35.160 --> 15:39.160
that the Disneyland police had tapped our conversation and dropped the calls, because

15:39.160 --> 15:42.520
you know Disneylandís got some scary security.

15:42.520 --> 15:47.600
The whole point of it, though, is that they are presentingóthis is why all the stuff

15:47.600 --> 15:51.920
that happens around the park is called behind the scenes for a reason.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.700
Everythingóthe employees are cast members.

15:54.700 --> 15:58.000
Everything there is sent to present something, and a phone callóthey donít want to get

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
in the way of that.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
All right.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.800
Well, speaking of craziness, our next guests are crazy, but in a good way.

16:03.800 --> 16:04.800
Yes, Dark Sakura?

16:04.800 --> 16:05.800
Yeah.

16:05.800 --> 16:14.440
We have Franz here and Ron Workman from Destructoid.com.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.440
All right.

16:15.440 --> 16:20.000
We are joined here now on our Orange Ons Radio year-end special with one, two, three people

16:20.000 --> 16:23.720
joining us from the website Destructoid.com.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.000
Say hello, everybody, to Franz.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Franz, you there?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
This is Franz from Destructoid.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Hey, how you doing, Franz?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Man of many words.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Yeah.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
And the voice you hear there is Ron.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Hey.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
How you doing?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Hey.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Graybush Workman.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
How you doing?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Graybush in the house.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Thanks for having us.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Not a problem.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
And also joining us, say hello to Shir.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Whatís up, guys?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Yeah.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
I donít have anything to say.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Iím boring.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Thatís all right.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.160
We often donít either, but we somehow fill three hours every week.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.920
Iím so fucking laid back.

16:53.920 --> 16:59.540
So you guys all blog for the Destructoid.com website, but do you guys participate in their

16:59.540 --> 17:01.520
podcast as well, Podtoid?

17:01.520 --> 17:02.520
Occasionally.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.520
Yeah, sometimes.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.520
Usually, Ron.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.800
Yeah, Iím usually turning into the comic relief for the show.

17:07.800 --> 17:12.080
They beg, but I have things to do to leave me alone.

17:12.080 --> 17:14.960
How many bloggers do they have over at Destructoid?

17:14.960 --> 17:18.560
Because when Iím looking at the list of people, it looks like Iím looking at a picture of

17:18.560 --> 17:19.560
The Last Supper or something.

17:19.560 --> 17:20.560
There are so many people.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.360
I think what are we looking at?

17:22.360 --> 17:28.160
Probably mid to high 30s, I mean in January weíre maybe looking at over 40, hopefully.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.160
Wow.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.160
Yeah.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.160
A couple more people.

17:31.160 --> 17:36.640
Weíve got well over a dozen people that post daily and consistently and stuff like that,

17:36.640 --> 17:42.480
and thatís kind of our thing, what weíre shooting for, is to update information.

17:42.480 --> 17:46.680
Gregory made a joke last night, hey, weíre the only website that posts at 3.30 in the

17:46.680 --> 17:47.680
morning every day.

17:47.680 --> 17:48.680
Yeah.

17:48.680 --> 17:51.320
Weíve got people that are up all night messing around with stuff.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.200
So you guys really are an army of robots when you say that.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.760
It seems that way.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.800
Weíre turning into the Detroit Army, I guess.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.800
All right.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.880
So weíre going to pick the Armyís brain here a little bit on some of the gaming topics

18:02.880 --> 18:07.440
in a little game we call Year in Review 2006.

18:07.440 --> 18:12.840
So we have nine boxes left, because people have been plucking all the other boxes.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.020
And Franz, weíll start with you.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.680
Which box do you want to open up?

18:15.680 --> 18:17.800
Box one through nine, any one of them.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.440
If thereís a PS3 in it, Iím returning it, though.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.440
Weíll see.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.880
Iíll go with nine.

18:23.880 --> 18:29.080
Box nine, letís take a look.

18:29.080 --> 18:35.080
We want to know, Franz, what did you think was the most creative game in 2006?

18:35.080 --> 18:36.640
Damn.

18:36.640 --> 18:39.280
Most creative game in 2006.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.280
Come on.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.280
Viva Pinata.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.280
Viva Pinata.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.280
Actually, no.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.280
Ronís actually got a point.

18:44.280 --> 18:45.280
Itís one of the two games heís played.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.280
Viva Pinata.

18:46.280 --> 18:50.960
When you get a game where you re-rate the engine to make it look more kitty, and itís

18:50.960 --> 18:55.660
mating animals that dance around for the whole game, thatís pretty damn creative.

18:55.660 --> 18:57.160
You said there was two going around in your mind?

18:57.160 --> 18:58.840
What was the other one, out of curiosity?

18:58.840 --> 19:02.320
No, that was just the only game around in Wartmanís Blotting this year.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.280
Oh, I see.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.600
Is Viva Pinata really for kids, though?

19:07.600 --> 19:11.600
Because I know when I played it, I was like, if I was seven, my controller would be through

19:11.600 --> 19:12.600
the window right now.

19:12.600 --> 19:13.600
Itís going to be tough for kids to understand it.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.520
Itís like Pokemon in the sense that anybody can enjoy it.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.480
Like, I played Pokemon, and that was a great game.

19:17.480 --> 19:18.480
I donít know.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.960
Thereís some stuff in Viva Pinata that my gray bush ass couldnít figure out how to

19:22.960 --> 19:23.960
do, thatís for sure.

19:23.960 --> 19:24.960
I know.

19:24.960 --> 19:25.960
I was getting frustrated with Viva Pinata.

19:25.960 --> 19:29.080
I was looking stuff up on the internet, and people were feeling bad for me, like, ìHere,

19:29.080 --> 19:32.520
Iíll send you Pinata Vignata.î And Iím like, ìNo, I want these damn mice to have

19:32.520 --> 19:35.240
sex.î And weíre all of a sudden fucking Mensa.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.800
My Vignattas kept beating each other.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.800
It was like Lord of the Wise.

19:40.800 --> 19:41.800
Yes.

19:41.800 --> 19:42.800
Horrible.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.960
So Viva Vignata, most creative game.

19:45.960 --> 19:50.520
Franz, the newest topic we want to know your opinion on, and I donít know if you have

19:50.520 --> 19:55.760
any friends over in the UK, but it seems like one of the recurring themes in 2006 is that

19:55.760 --> 19:59.920
our buddies in the UK keep getting the shaft.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.840
I think thatís when the story of their lives, thatís definitely true.

20:02.840 --> 20:09.480
Why does Britain keep getting fucked over when it comes to release dates or system launches,

20:09.480 --> 20:10.480
prices of games?

20:10.480 --> 20:13.000
Why do they keep getting picked on?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.640
I think itís a shame.

20:15.640 --> 20:19.760
If Microsoft would jump on that and divvy up their sales a lot more, I think that would

20:19.760 --> 20:20.760
give them a lot more price.

20:20.760 --> 20:25.040
Now, didnít the Wii just come out two days ago or something?

20:25.040 --> 20:26.720
They could barely do pre-sales over there.

20:26.720 --> 20:27.720
No, like two days.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.360
They came out like two weeks ago.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.360
Oh, okay.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.560
And theyíre waiting until March, I guess, to do the PlayStation over there?

20:32.560 --> 20:34.360
Yeah, then I mean you get a taste of it.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.360
Jesus.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.840
Well, hell, half the United States didnít get a taste of it in there.

20:37.840 --> 20:42.160
Although itís important to note too that they banned games thatís kind of unnecessary

20:42.160 --> 20:43.160
too.

20:43.160 --> 20:48.280
Like even Rule of Rose and stuff, so maybe theyíre hesitant to help them out any time

20:48.280 --> 20:49.280
soon.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.280
Did you guys play Rule of Rose?

20:50.280 --> 20:51.280
It wasnít that bad.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.280
I didnít think it was that bad.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.280
I heard it was terrible.

20:54.280 --> 20:59.280
The game itself is kind of something I feel like I played before, but I mean the game

20:59.280 --> 21:00.280
was okay.

21:00.280 --> 21:03.280
I certainly played worse games this year, but I didnít think the story was that bad.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.040
It just involved sexual themes that kind of had kids.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.880
What was that out on?

21:07.880 --> 21:08.880
PS2.

21:08.880 --> 21:09.880
PS2.

21:09.880 --> 21:10.880
Yeah.

21:10.880 --> 21:11.880
It was easy.

21:11.880 --> 21:15.160
I just think the problem with Rule of Rose, it was a full-price title, wasnít it?

21:15.160 --> 21:17.240
It was like a $49.99 they wanted for it?

21:17.240 --> 21:18.240
Yeah.

21:18.240 --> 21:21.240
Yeah, so that was the biggest problem is because PS2, you know.

21:21.240 --> 21:25.400
Well, thatís just Atlus because theyíre retarded and still think they can get $49.99

21:25.400 --> 21:29.360
for a PlayStation 2 game at the end of its life cycle, so.

21:29.360 --> 21:34.240
Well, you know, I guess if Square can get $59 for a collectorís edition of Final Fantasy

21:34.240 --> 21:36.240
XII, which has nothing special, by the way, nothing special.

21:36.240 --> 21:40.200
Oh, Final Fantasy XII, I love this in Final Fantasy.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.200
It is a sexy game.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.200
Iíll give you that.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.200
All right.

21:43.200 --> 21:48.080
And itís actually GameStop that thinks they can get $59.99 for the special edition of

21:48.080 --> 21:49.080
Final Fantasy XII.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.720
Well, they got it from me, but thatís because Iím a corporate whore.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.640
Shira, itís your turn.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.360
Why donít you pick a box?

21:55.360 --> 21:57.040
Now we have one through eight left.

21:57.040 --> 22:00.200
Hmm, Iíll pick number three.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.200
Box number three.

22:01.200 --> 22:05.560
Letís open it up.

22:05.560 --> 22:06.560
Box number three.

22:06.560 --> 22:07.760
Oh, this is a good one.

22:07.760 --> 22:11.760
What do you believe was the most disappointing game of 2006?

22:11.760 --> 22:16.880
Hmm, Iím going to get a lot of flak for this.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.200
Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.200
Oh, snap.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.200
Ouch.

22:20.200 --> 22:23.200
Why, uh, why Zelda Twilight Princess?

22:23.200 --> 22:26.720
I donít know, because Zeldaís the type of game where everyoneís like, this game is

22:26.720 --> 22:29.800
better than unicorns fucking pixies.

22:29.800 --> 22:30.800
But itís not.

22:30.800 --> 22:31.800
Itís not so great.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.800
And that would be great.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.800
I donít know about you guys.

22:33.800 --> 22:34.800
Thatís funny.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.400
Thatís exactly how I described it on the last episode of Orange Lounge.

22:37.400 --> 22:38.400
Itís amazing.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.400
I was likeÖ

22:39.400 --> 22:41.400
Yeah, but everyoneís like, this is going to be the greatest game ever.

22:41.400 --> 22:44.400
And then I played it and I was like, yeah, this isnít the greatest game ever.

22:44.400 --> 22:45.400
I donít know.

22:45.400 --> 22:48.400
My only little comment for that is it came out two years late.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.400
Yeah.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.400
Itís part of the thing that makes it a disappointment.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.400
Sure.

22:52.400 --> 22:56.200
Is that the problem for you, is that this is essentially a GameCube game with Wii controls?

22:56.200 --> 22:57.200
Well, no.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.200
Thatís not the problem.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.400
Itís just that I donít really like Zelda then.

23:00.400 --> 23:07.400
Like, I like games in that genre, I like Ocarina of Time is okay, I like Majoraís Mask, like

23:07.400 --> 23:08.400
Wind Waker.

23:08.400 --> 23:12.400
But this one is just, like, boring, thereís no real character depth, and I was just like,

23:12.400 --> 23:13.400
yeah, fuck this.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.400
All right.

23:14.400 --> 23:17.400
Iím going to chime in on what they think the most disappointing game of 2006 was.

23:17.400 --> 23:21.400
Rare didnít come out with anything, did they?

23:21.400 --> 23:22.400
No, perfect.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.400
Thatís a lie.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.400
Didnít they just release Viva Pinata?

23:25.400 --> 23:26.400
Viva Pinata?

23:26.400 --> 23:27.400
Oh, yes.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.400
It is.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.400
Thatís a rare game.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.400
I donít know whatÖ

23:30.400 --> 23:31.400
Oh, no, Novadrome.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.400
Novadrome for Xbox Live Arcade.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.400
Why Novadrome?

23:33.400 --> 23:34.400
Oh, it was garbage.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.400
It killed me.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.400
Have you played it?

23:36.400 --> 23:37.400
Yeah, I have.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.400
I have.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.400
I have.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.400
I have.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.400
I have.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.960
It was just, you look at it, itís like $10 for this thing.

23:44.960 --> 23:49.960
It was like a really bad, like, I only played a few minutes, it was that bad that I was

23:49.960 --> 23:54.400
just laughing, but $10 for a game thatís a real bad twisted metal.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.400
Oh, Red Steel 2, Novadrome.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.400
Red Steel was atrocious.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.400
Can you believe they green-lighted a sequel to Red Steel?

24:01.400 --> 24:06.400
Yeah, because I think a lot of people were really looking forward to it and really, like,

24:06.400 --> 24:09.400
looking for all the new concepts and theyíre like, yeah, letís do this.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.400
Iím looking for all the new concepts and theyíre like, man, this is going to be the

24:12.400 --> 24:13.400
greatest game ever.

24:13.400 --> 24:16.400
And Ubisoft, when they released it, everyone was like, well, this isnít that good.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.400
There are a lot of things you could do better.

24:18.400 --> 24:22.400
So Ubisoft is going to take that into account, make a better game with the, you know, the

24:22.400 --> 24:25.400
similar core gameplay, and itís just going to be fucking awesome.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.400
I realize thatís what I hope happens.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.400
All right.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.400
Weíll see.

24:29.400 --> 24:33.920
Shir, the news topic I want to know your opinion on has to do with the price ranges for video

24:33.920 --> 24:35.900
game systems in 2006.

24:35.900 --> 24:39.760
We heard at one point that, you know, even though I think most of us knew this was BS,

24:39.760 --> 24:42.160
but the revolution was going to be $99.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.480
This is when it was still called the revolution, not the Wii.

24:44.480 --> 24:48.640
And then, you know, suddenly it was, okay, 250, more reasonable, probably what we expected.

24:48.640 --> 24:53.280
But then all the way up to $600 for the PlayStation 3 or $500 for the low end, depending on how

24:53.280 --> 24:54.280
you look at it.

24:54.280 --> 24:57.880
So weíve had systems cost anywhere at one point or another in theory or whatever it

24:57.880 --> 25:00.440
would be, $99 to $600.

25:00.440 --> 25:05.780
How important do you think price is of these systems in the console wars that are going

25:05.780 --> 25:07.680
on here in 2006 and on into í07?

25:07.680 --> 25:12.880
Iím glad I got this topic because Iím broke as hell, so this is just the perfect topic

25:12.880 --> 25:13.880
for me.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.720
And itís a big factor for me when Iím buying systems.

25:16.720 --> 25:19.400
For example, I donít have a 360 because Iím broke.

25:19.400 --> 25:25.320
Itís like 400 bucks and you canít play without live, really, and then it requires a yearly

25:25.320 --> 25:27.600
fee that I really donít have because Iím broke.

25:27.600 --> 25:28.600
No.

25:28.600 --> 25:29.600
400 bucks live comes with it.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.600
Shut the hell up, Ron.

25:30.600 --> 25:31.600
You always miss that.

25:31.600 --> 25:35.440
You always see these press releases and theyíre like, and then youíve got to buy live.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.240
So it comes with it for 400 bucks.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.240
Dude, the gold package or whatever.

25:39.240 --> 25:40.480
Well, who gives a shit?

25:40.480 --> 25:42.680
If you want to play games online, you can play with silver.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.560
Thereís no difference aside from multiplayer.

25:44.560 --> 25:48.200
You canít have four people on your Xbox plan.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.640
Goldís a better color.

25:50.640 --> 25:51.640
It is.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.960
We have to be 24.

25:53.960 --> 25:57.440
And yeah, so anyway, Wiiís $250.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.960
I thought it was going to be cheaper instead of everyone else, but I really didnít care

25:59.960 --> 26:02.000
because I could scrape up $250.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.520
I canít scrape up $400 because I suck, and the PS3 is just way out there, and even if

26:07.520 --> 26:09.880
you want to go on eBay, itís like a grand.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.880
And so yeah, itís a bit ñ

26:11.880 --> 26:15.360
Dude, for such dollars, go buy a cheap remote, spray paint it white, and spray paint your

26:15.360 --> 26:16.360
GameCube white.

26:16.360 --> 26:17.360
Youíve got to Wii.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.360
No, you donít.

26:18.360 --> 26:19.360
Neither one of them can play BBB.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.360
I canít argue with you, Ron, because youíre just the biggest dick in the world.

26:22.360 --> 26:23.360
They both have subpar graphics.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.200
But you canít play Elibits on the GameCube.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.200
That makes a point.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.240
Theyíre not going to drop that.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.240
Theyíre not going to push it out on the ñ

26:31.240 --> 26:34.240
I guess there wouldnít be any way to do it with the controls.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.240
Damn right.

26:35.240 --> 26:36.240
You just lost.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.240
All right.

26:37.240 --> 26:38.240
Well, we got to keep it moving here.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.240
Thanks.

26:39.240 --> 26:40.240
Thanks for your input.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.240
Letís move on over to Graybush.

26:41.240 --> 26:42.240
Oh, great.

26:42.240 --> 26:46.240
Please be a question about how to get rid of crabs.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.000
Please be how to get rid of crabs.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
One through seven.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Take your pick.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.500
I will take number four.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.500
Number four.

26:52.500 --> 26:57.880
Letís open up case number four.

26:57.880 --> 27:01.400
Most downloadable content for a game.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.600
Oh, content?

27:03.600 --> 27:06.520
Oh, God.

27:06.520 --> 27:08.440
Youíre going to brag on me on this one.

27:08.440 --> 27:12.240
I hate to say this, but the damn UNO player packs.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.240
Really?

27:13.240 --> 27:17.960
Are you a big cameo card fan?

27:17.960 --> 27:21.200
The thing I had the most fun with this year is all ñ

27:21.200 --> 27:22.200
Iím coming out of the closet, Ron.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.200
I know, man.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.200
Iím Ricky Martin all over again with this.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.800
Iím just ñ I canít ñ best downloadable add-on to a game.

27:27.800 --> 27:31.360
Well, Call of Duty map packs, obviously, were cool for me.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.600
Well, I thought you said UNO.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.000
I thought we were going with UNO here.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.400
Well, Iím just trying to think.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.640
Iím arguing back and forth here.

27:37.640 --> 27:45.560
Iíd say Call of Duty map packs I probably had the most fun with, but the UNO stuff got

27:45.560 --> 27:47.120
me to play UNO for some odd reason.

27:47.120 --> 27:51.640
Iíd be on Xbox Live and have all this money in this machine, and weíd be sitting there

27:51.640 --> 27:55.360
on our video cameras chatting with each other on UNO, and it was just like, what kind of

27:55.360 --> 27:58.560
revolution is this?

27:58.560 --> 28:02.240
I would have to be a tie between the stupid add-on packs that actually got me to play

28:02.240 --> 28:08.360
UNO and stay up all night with people bullshitting on there, and the Call of Duty 2 maps.

28:08.360 --> 28:12.160
Does it have anything to do with the webcams on UNO?

28:12.160 --> 28:15.640
Thatís one news story that didnít quite make our cut for being included tonight.

28:15.640 --> 28:20.440
When they first came out, it was really funny because there would be three or four of us

28:20.440 --> 28:26.640
in a room and weíd be like, ìOh, look, thereís somebodyís ass and somebodyís boobs.î

28:26.640 --> 28:30.000
I guess the novelty wore off real quick, but it was a really funny thing.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.440
But it was cool because I could sit on my back porch and smoke cigarettes and play UNO

28:35.440 --> 28:38.440
because the controller vibrates when itís your turn, and UNO is so hard you just hit

28:38.440 --> 28:39.440
the A button.

28:39.440 --> 28:40.440
You donít even have to look at the screen.

28:40.440 --> 28:43.560
I mean, seriously, there would be media nights Iíd be sitting outside smoking a cigarette.

28:43.560 --> 28:46.880
I couldnít even see, but Iíd be chatting on my headset.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.360
When the controller vibrated, I hit the button and it would throw a card out there because

28:49.360 --> 28:51.540
it doesnít matter, itís UNO.

28:51.540 --> 28:55.720
Playing UNO on live is weird for me now because I feel like Iím always playing against lonely

28:55.720 --> 28:58.280
girl 15 with the webcam.

28:58.280 --> 29:05.040
But itís one of those things where I never expected to have fun ever, ever playing UNO.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.800
I never even expected to play UNO.

29:06.800 --> 29:10.120
When we get in there, itís just a bunch of us friends and we bullshit and we have a good

29:10.120 --> 29:11.120
time.

29:11.120 --> 29:15.360
Itís not as much about UNO gameplay, but I remember when we added the new decks to

29:15.360 --> 29:17.880
it and changed the game and we started playing with strategy.

29:17.880 --> 29:22.600
It was like, ìWeíre actually playing fucking UNO.î It was one of those types of things

29:22.600 --> 29:25.480
where somebodyís done something right if weíre actually playing UNO.

29:25.480 --> 29:29.560
Now, are you guys big on the shit-talking on UNO, like drop form, motherfucker, and

29:29.560 --> 29:30.560
things like that?

29:30.560 --> 29:33.560
Yeah, but itís always joking.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.360
Reverse bitch.

29:36.360 --> 29:41.960
Speaking of fun games, the news story we wanted to ask you about would be Guitar Hero because

29:41.960 --> 29:46.520
we obviously had Guitar Hero 2 come out this year, which is the sequel to a monster hit

29:46.520 --> 29:51.400
last year, and then they announced, and this is still a bit of a rumor status, but that

29:51.400 --> 29:56.000
thereís going to be a quartet of new Guitar Hero games coming out through the next year.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
You know, the one on the 360 and so on and so on.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.280
Is too much Guitar Hero too much of a good thing?

30:02.280 --> 30:06.880
Iíve never played it because itís a video game that involves me dancing around with

30:06.880 --> 30:08.360
a plastic toy guitar.

30:08.360 --> 30:09.920
And yet you play UNO and you wonítÖ

30:09.920 --> 30:14.320
There is nothing thatís ever going to be cool about a grown man dancing around with

30:14.320 --> 30:16.040
a plastic toy guitar.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.040
I know.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.040
I get you.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.040
You play fucking UNO.

30:19.040 --> 30:22.160
Sitting on the back porch playing UNO smoking cigarettes is fucking rad, huh?

30:22.160 --> 30:23.160
Yeah, I know.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.400
Iím not beat to answer around with a plastic guitar.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.400
It looks to me like a rock star.

30:27.400 --> 30:31.120
Guitar Hero is like the lamer version of DDR for me.

30:31.120 --> 30:35.120
I know people love it and get into it, but itís just like you play it with a plastic

30:35.120 --> 30:36.120
toy.

30:36.120 --> 30:39.920
It would be like me playing Call of Duty with a squirt gun, hiding behind couches and everything.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.920
Ron Workman is a communist.

30:41.920 --> 30:45.960
Ron, out of curiosity, Ron, have you ever heard of a Japanese game calledÖ

30:45.960 --> 30:46.960
No.

30:46.960 --> 30:47.960
Alright, just donít.

30:47.960 --> 30:49.960
Donít ever look it up because youíll hate it.

30:49.960 --> 30:52.960
Is it a rhythm game?

30:52.960 --> 30:59.840
Yeah, itís based on this old Japanese style of dancing that was done by girls wearing

30:59.840 --> 31:03.440
these big tall boots and they wave their hands around like to Eurobeat music.

31:03.440 --> 31:04.440
Itís something to behold.

31:04.440 --> 31:05.440
Iíll give you that.

31:05.440 --> 31:10.440
Mine is one of those things, like, I would never let someone see me in public playing

31:10.440 --> 31:14.640
DDR unless I was completely just wasted drunk off my ass because when I see people playing

31:14.640 --> 31:19.720
DDR, Iím just like, ìYou look ridiculous!î Iím one of those guys thatís just like,

31:19.720 --> 31:20.720
ìLook at that guy playing DDR!

31:20.720 --> 31:25.200
He looks like an idiot!î Iíve always been like that and Guitar Heroís kind of the same

31:25.200 --> 31:26.200
thing.

31:26.200 --> 31:30.520
I hate toÖ Iím not condemning it, but I canít see myself playing it with a plastic

31:30.520 --> 31:31.520
toy dancing around.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.960
But in the privacy of your own home when no oneís looking?

31:33.960 --> 31:34.960
Maybe I would.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.440
Itís kind of like the ìween awayî where if you play it at home, people are going to

31:37.440 --> 31:41.280
see it and people like Ron wonít want to play it, but the others will be interested

31:41.280 --> 31:42.280
and theyíll pick it up.

31:42.280 --> 31:46.280
I donít see the 360 sales doing well with it, but six months from now I donít see it

31:46.280 --> 31:47.280
doing well.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.280
And when they come out with a wireless guitar?

31:48.280 --> 31:49.280
I love guitar.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.280
Yeah.

31:50.280 --> 31:55.400
And that actually looks pretty tough, so maybe Iím going to get one when I do that.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.400
All right.

31:56.400 --> 31:57.400
All right.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.360
Weíre going to go around now and Iím going to ask everybody what they believe the best

31:59.360 --> 32:02.760
game of 2006 was and the worst game we hear at Orange Launch Radio.

32:02.760 --> 32:05.200
Weíre tallying it up, so weíll start with the best game.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.880
Franz, what do you think the best game was of 2006?

32:07.880 --> 32:10.200
Cliche, but Twilight Princess.

32:10.200 --> 32:15.760
Why Twilight Princess over everything else?

32:15.760 --> 32:16.760
Waiting for Shearís answer now.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.760
Because Iíll admit that itís not quite as good as I hoped.

32:19.760 --> 32:25.600
I think the wolf part downplays it a little bit, but if you forget about it, itís a Zelda

32:25.600 --> 32:30.480
game and if you just pretend it was a completely new game and you compare it to any other game

32:30.480 --> 32:32.080
from 2006, the game plays solid.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.000
Thereís not a lot to complain about.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.320
Itís a high nine, so I think it wonít have a top, but not even Gears.

32:38.320 --> 32:41.080
Itís a game thatís topping a lot of peopleís list.

32:41.080 --> 32:45.080
Shear, what did you think the best game of 2006 was?

32:45.080 --> 32:46.720
Final Fantasy XII, hands down.

32:46.720 --> 32:47.720
Final Fantasy XII.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.320
That game just ripped me apart.

32:49.320 --> 32:50.320
I got it.

32:50.320 --> 32:52.760
I played it for like 20 hours in the first three days.

32:52.760 --> 32:53.920
I just played it nonstop.

32:53.920 --> 32:54.920
I love that game.

32:54.920 --> 32:55.920
Itís so good.

32:55.920 --> 33:00.720
Have you always been a Final Fantasy series whore or was XII kind of your enabler?

33:00.720 --> 33:03.520
I played Final Fantasy VII, loved it.

33:03.520 --> 33:06.160
Played Final Fantasy VIII, fuck you guys, loved it.

33:06.160 --> 33:11.320
Played Final Fantasy IX, hated FFX and hated everything else after FFX, so FFXII was kind

33:11.320 --> 33:12.320
of the last.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.320
Which would be FFXI.

33:13.320 --> 33:16.320
Yeah, FFXI and then the spinoff games.

33:16.320 --> 33:17.320
Oh, yeah.

33:17.320 --> 33:18.320
True.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.320
Theyíre just a bit of some crap.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.040
No, I deleted those from my brain.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.480
FFXII doesnít exist to me.

33:23.480 --> 33:28.760
Yeah, so I really liked FFXII, Rebirth of the Series, really interesting characters,

33:28.760 --> 33:31.280
amazing graphics and I just loved it so much.

33:31.280 --> 33:32.280
Itís so good.

33:32.280 --> 33:35.560
All right, dare I ask, Ron Workman, best game of 2006.

33:35.560 --> 33:40.640
Youíre going to make fun of me, but Burger King, Sneak King.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.080
Iím totally fucking around.

33:43.080 --> 33:47.600
Come on, what was the best value of 2006, at least notó

33:47.600 --> 33:50.120
Yeah, the Burger King games were three bucks, four bucks, whatever.

33:50.120 --> 33:56.640
Yeah, gee, I could pay $4.99 or I could pay $5 for a new Rally-X. Let me think.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.680
Hey, youíre really going to lay it to me.

33:58.680 --> 34:01.600
I actually bought that shit, didnít I, when I was drunk.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.600
I bought Rally-X.

34:02.600 --> 34:03.600
So did I.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.600
Letís not tell anyone.

34:04.600 --> 34:12.560
I remember it when I was a kid, you know, playing with a big steering wheel and stuff.

34:12.560 --> 34:17.200
Gears of War, I mean, I really liked Reba Pinana and Call of Duty 3, I think, was underrated,

34:17.200 --> 34:20.840
but I have to say, I mean, Gears of War, hands down, itís a no-brainer for me, you know,

34:20.840 --> 34:25.440
and Iím not into the fantasy games like Zelda or Final Fantasy, nothing against them, but

34:25.440 --> 34:26.440
I justó

34:26.440 --> 34:28.440
Youíre a gun fan.

34:28.440 --> 34:32.800
Yeah, itís an amazing game to me, you know.

34:32.800 --> 34:38.640
I like, you know, Cliffy B, they did some really innovative stuff, in my opinion, and

34:38.640 --> 34:43.000
thereís things that were like, you play those first person shooters and stuff, and youíre

34:43.000 --> 34:48.600
always looking for the next gimmick, but this wasnít the same thing, itís, I donít know,

34:48.600 --> 34:52.560
it was immersive, like you got into it, and it was a different thing.

34:52.560 --> 34:56.480
And Call of Duty 3 is the same way for me, itís really immersive for me.

34:56.480 --> 35:00.220
I like how they changed it, like a lot of people donít like it because they were used

35:00.220 --> 35:04.440
to the Unreal Tournament 100 mile an hour multiplayer with Call of Duty 2, where it

35:04.440 --> 35:07.160
wasnít like a war game at all.

35:07.160 --> 35:10.680
And lately Iíve been reallyóI didnít get 3 until a few weeks ago, but Iíve been really

35:10.680 --> 35:14.160
impressed and, you know, me and Suma even discussed it, weíre like, we donít understand

35:14.160 --> 35:15.160
why people donít like it.

35:15.160 --> 35:19.280
Itís a really underrated game, but, you know, Gears of War, hands down, itís better than

35:19.280 --> 35:20.280
it, so.

35:20.280 --> 35:24.840
But probably Call of Duty 3 definitely on your top 10 for the year, at least.

35:24.840 --> 35:29.440
Yeah, it was a real, like, late bloomer for me that I just wasnít expecting to be that

35:29.440 --> 35:33.600
good because I heard so much bad feedback, you know, and I liked Call of Duty 2 because

35:33.600 --> 35:37.200
Iím a big multiplayer fan, so.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.200
My worst game of the year?

35:38.200 --> 35:39.200
Novadrome.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.200
Yeah, sure, why not?

35:40.200 --> 35:41.200
Well, letís go into worst game of the year.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.200
Ron, start us off.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.200
Novadrome.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.200
Novadrome.

35:44.200 --> 35:47.560
He smacked it in the face for making that game.

35:47.560 --> 35:52.080
They owe me 20 bucks for playing the demo, thatís how I view it, and Iím still pissed.

35:52.080 --> 35:55.920
What was soóI mean, because, I donít know if itís just me, but they really hyped up

35:55.920 --> 36:01.680
these end-of-year Xbox Live independent title releases that they were going to do, and I

36:01.680 --> 36:04.560
wasnít really impressed with any of them, even Assault Heroes.

36:04.560 --> 36:09.280
I wasnít really feelingóI was kind of like, Iíd almost rather play Rally-X.

36:09.280 --> 36:10.880
Ten bucks, you know?

36:10.880 --> 36:15.000
Yeah, Rally-X, the deciding thing was like, I was like, ìAh, Iíll play this one as a

36:15.000 --> 36:18.760
kid, whatever, you know, five bucks, no big deal, but $10 on some of those games is a

36:18.760 --> 36:22.040
little tough for me to swallow, and itís not that Iím tight with money about it, you

36:22.040 --> 36:23.040
know?

36:23.040 --> 36:27.960
But if I could play the demo, like, the Assault Heroes demo was pretty long, and thatís fine,

36:27.960 --> 36:28.960
you know?

36:28.960 --> 36:32.400
Like, Iíve bought Pac-Man and Frogger and Galaga and all those, but, contra.

36:32.400 --> 36:36.120
Out of curiosity, how do you feel about the Wii downloadable stuff?

36:36.120 --> 36:38.120
Would you pay $10 for an N64 game?

36:38.120 --> 36:43.500
The last time I played a Wii was six months ago at a private show, and Iíve not played

36:43.500 --> 36:48.920
one since, and Iím not even seeing the virtual console stuffóor, yeah, is that what itís

36:48.920 --> 36:49.920
called?

36:49.920 --> 36:50.920
Virtual console?

36:50.920 --> 36:51.920
Yeah.

36:51.920 --> 36:52.920
Yeah, not even seeing it.

36:52.920 --> 36:57.560
But I do know about the pricing, and it disappoints me that Nintendo is doing that.

36:57.560 --> 37:02.880
You know, I guess they can, because their fans are, you know, I really hate to get into

37:02.880 --> 37:04.760
this, but Nintendo fanboys are pussies.

37:04.760 --> 37:08.040
You guys should stand up and fight.

37:08.040 --> 37:14.120
You should fight Nintendo to make better shit.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.120
Nintendoís never going to make better shit, and theyíre going to come out with subpar

37:17.120 --> 37:19.120
consoles and charge too much.

37:19.120 --> 37:22.920
All right, Nintendo fans, you can address those cards and letters to Graybush, Care

37:22.920 --> 37:23.920
of Destruction.

37:23.920 --> 37:27.440
Non-Graybush workmen, yeah, exactly, but no, itís one of those things where, like, Xbox

37:27.440 --> 37:32.600
Live is genius, and the reason itís genius is because people are absolute assholes to

37:32.600 --> 37:34.840
Microsoft and theyíre not scared to be.

37:34.840 --> 37:38.680
If theyíre pissed, they will flame them to hell and back, or write it on their blogs

37:38.680 --> 37:39.680
or whatever.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.920
Do you think no one wants to stand up to Reggie because heíd kick your ass?

37:42.920 --> 37:47.880
Nintendo is this golden cow that nobody wants to, you know, theyíre on a pedestal, and

37:47.880 --> 37:50.920
come on, Nintendo canít do anything wrong, blah, blah, blah, thereís some shit games

37:50.920 --> 37:51.920
out there on the Wii.

37:51.920 --> 37:56.440
Nobody bitches about them like they would if it was a bad Xbox game, you know, like

37:56.440 --> 37:57.440
Xbox Live.

37:57.440 --> 38:02.560
I donít know, Loki kind of went off on Cars the other week.

38:02.560 --> 38:05.200
And all the Ubisoft games suck ass.

38:05.200 --> 38:09.120
I have officially boycotted them for all their Wii launch titles.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.080
What about Rayman?

38:11.080 --> 38:14.680
Rayman was just average, and that was their best game of the entire lineup.

38:14.680 --> 38:19.160
The show Rayman was my favorite.

38:19.160 --> 38:23.720
I really wish that people would say, ìHey, Nintendo, we donít want a system that only

38:23.720 --> 38:27.360
has the graphic power of an Xbox, an original Xbox.

38:27.360 --> 38:28.960
We want to be able to play DVDs.

38:28.960 --> 38:34.600
We want to have online multiplayer out of the box and launch games to back it up.

38:34.600 --> 38:41.040
We donít want to pay $10 for a Mario Brother game weíve bought 20 times before, you know?

38:41.040 --> 38:46.600
Itís dicking their fans over, if you add all that stuff into what you spend to have

38:46.600 --> 38:51.240
games and play the Wii and to track down 4 controllers for the damn thing, itís not

38:51.240 --> 38:53.360
any cheaper than buying a 360.î

38:53.360 --> 38:55.920
Alright, weíve got to keep it moving.

38:55.920 --> 38:56.920
Thatís alright, sorry.

38:56.920 --> 38:57.920
No, thatís ok.

38:57.920 --> 38:58.920
Let me get over my fanboy.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.760
You just sound like you could go all day long on this Nintendo thing.

39:01.760 --> 39:07.540
Iíll leave him to read the Destructoid.com blog to see your further love and adoration

39:07.540 --> 39:09.040
for all things Nintendo.

39:09.040 --> 39:12.080
Iíd like for your rights as a gamer.

39:12.080 --> 39:16.800
Shear, what would you say is the worst game of 2006?

39:16.800 --> 39:17.800
Red Steel.

39:17.800 --> 39:22.880
Because you asked me what the biggest disappointment of 2006 was, and I said Father Princess, but

39:22.880 --> 39:25.680
Red Steel was the kind of game that I never really had expectations for.

39:25.680 --> 39:28.880
I saw it, I was like, ìThat could be cool, but itís probably not going to be.î And

39:28.880 --> 39:31.360
I played it and it wasnít, it was just so bad.

39:31.360 --> 39:35.400
And even the multiplayer, walking around, dinosaurs shooting me in the face, Iím like,

39:35.400 --> 39:38.920
ìWhat the hell is this?î The controls were terrible, the guns were terrible.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.120
I just hated it with a passion.

39:41.120 --> 39:44.040
I remember the buzz about that a long time ago before it came out, it was like, ìThis

39:44.040 --> 39:46.680
is going to be really cool, you can swing your sword around and blah, blah, blah.î

39:46.680 --> 39:47.680
Oh man, the multiplayer.

39:47.680 --> 39:52.240
It was like, ìThis is garbage.î You all worry about that whole, theyíre going to

39:52.240 --> 39:55.400
call you and you put the Wiimote to your ear and everybodyís like, ìThatís such a cool

39:55.400 --> 39:56.400
idea.î Yeah, exactly.

39:56.400 --> 39:57.400
Itís so retarded.

39:57.400 --> 40:01.640
And at the time, they were saying you were going to be able to use a microphone that

40:01.640 --> 40:05.720
was in the Wiimote, because I played it a long time ago, which never came about.

40:05.720 --> 40:09.800
But my friend got it and I was like, ìDude, letís go play it.î And weíre playing it.

40:09.800 --> 40:14.080
And the multiplayer, as soon as you figure out how to use your stupid sword, like you

40:14.080 --> 40:16.680
brought it up to people and you just like, theyíre dazed and you just shoot them in

40:16.680 --> 40:21.040
the face like 45 times and itís so annoying because you canít kill anybody unless youíre

40:21.040 --> 40:22.040
using your stupid sword.

40:22.040 --> 40:26.440
And the multiplayer is cheap and the stupid ring thing is retarded.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.840
Was the game just rushed, you think?

40:28.840 --> 40:30.520
No, I just think it was atrocious.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.520
I think they donít know what theyíre doing.

40:32.520 --> 40:36.040
They said they were working on it for months, fixing it, so I think it just didnít pull

40:36.040 --> 40:37.040
it off.

40:37.040 --> 40:39.160
I think they were just like, ìYeah, fuck this game, this is terrible.î I donít know

40:39.160 --> 40:40.160
what they did.

40:40.160 --> 40:42.720
You know, you would think that they might be able to sell copies of Red Steel 2 if they

40:42.720 --> 40:46.400
just said, ìOh, Red Steel 1 was rushed, sorry, weíll make it better next time.î But you

40:46.400 --> 40:47.400
know, it kind ofÖ

40:47.400 --> 40:48.400
But it wasnít.

40:48.400 --> 40:49.400
It wasnít.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.400
It was just bad.

40:50.400 --> 40:51.400
All right.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.360
Franz, what would you think was the worst game of 2006?

40:53.360 --> 40:54.760
This oneís pretty easy.

40:54.760 --> 40:59.920
Armado, itís a game on the PSP and all it is is youíre an armadillo rolling around

40:59.920 --> 41:02.640
the game and all you do is hit one button to jump at the right time.

41:02.640 --> 41:03.640
Thatís the entire 40-dollar game.

41:03.640 --> 41:04.640
I shit you not.

41:04.640 --> 41:05.640
And itís not even a homebrew.

41:05.640 --> 41:06.640
Itís an actual game.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.640
It was like a small companyís first game, so I hate to knock it because, you knowÖ

41:09.640 --> 41:10.640
Youíre making shit up to get out of this easy.

41:10.640 --> 41:11.640
Nobody knows what youíre talking about.

41:11.640 --> 41:12.640
Nobody knows what youíre talking about.

41:12.640 --> 41:13.640
One of us down there at big names, Franz, is like, ìArmado.

41:13.640 --> 41:14.640
I hate it.î

41:14.640 --> 41:15.640
It caught my eye in game shows and I laughed my ass off at it.

41:15.640 --> 41:19.120
You know, funny enough, thatís not, out of all the ones weíve heard, thatís not the

41:19.120 --> 41:20.120
first game.

41:20.120 --> 41:31.760
Somebody mentioned itís the worst game that none of us had heard of, so there you go.

41:31.760 --> 41:37.080
Itíll be interesting to hear the rest.

41:37.080 --> 41:41.840
So is this why the PSP keeps getting flack for not having the same game power as the

41:41.840 --> 41:42.840
PSP?

41:42.840 --> 41:43.840
PSPís terrible.

41:43.840 --> 41:44.840
That shit is only disappointed about six.

41:44.840 --> 41:45.840
I just donít think they have enough good games.

41:45.840 --> 41:46.840
They have good games.

41:46.840 --> 41:47.840
They just donít have enough.

41:47.840 --> 41:48.840
I hate the PSP.

41:48.840 --> 41:49.840
I had it written for me.

41:49.840 --> 41:50.840
I hate it.

41:50.840 --> 41:51.840
I want to throw it at them.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.440
It cost me so much money, though.

41:54.440 --> 41:56.080
But Luminous, Metal Gear.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.080
Yeah, 360.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.080
Yeah.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.080
Keep going.

41:59.080 --> 42:00.080
All right.

42:00.080 --> 42:01.080
All right.

42:01.080 --> 42:03.840
Anyway, weíve got to wrap it up here.

42:03.840 --> 42:08.480
What do you guys have planned for 2007 over at Destructoid, if you can say?

42:08.480 --> 42:10.480
Lots of giveaways, thatís for sure.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.480
Yeah.

42:11.480 --> 42:12.480
Super secrets.

42:12.480 --> 42:13.480
Lots of bitches.

42:13.480 --> 42:14.480
All right.

42:14.480 --> 42:15.480
Lots of bitching.

42:15.480 --> 42:16.480
Lots of prizes.

42:16.480 --> 42:17.480
We want to give away a Wii a week.

42:17.480 --> 42:18.480
Yeah.

42:18.480 --> 42:19.480
Weíre working on it.

42:19.480 --> 42:20.480
Weíre shooting for it right now.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.480
Wow.

42:21.480 --> 42:26.360
And weíve got a big contest going with the Lord of the Rings people, I think, at Microsoft.

42:26.360 --> 42:32.120
And weíve got a big, big, big World of Warcraft thing coming at the end of the month.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.120
Awesome.

Not really.

Not me.

42:51.440 --> 42:52.440
I donít know.

42:52.440 --> 42:55.440

No problem.

43:05.640 --> 43:06.640
Yeah, absolutely.

43:06.640 --> 43:07.640
Dude, awesome.

43:07.640 --> 43:08.640
Thanks.

43:08.640 --> 43:09.640
Thanks so much for coming on, you guys.

43:09.640 --> 43:13.240
And best of luck to you guys at Destructoid, all 45 or how many of you there are over there

43:13.240 --> 43:14.240
in 2007.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.240
Well, 3,000 of us.

43:16.240 --> 43:27.600
Big thanks to those guys over there at Destructoid.com for coming on the program and especially

43:27.600 --> 43:32.580
to Franz because originally him and I were on another show called Cross Platform together

43:32.580 --> 43:35.020
earlier this year which is why I remembered him and originally it was just going to be

43:35.020 --> 43:38.320
him that came on, but he was like, ìDude, you want to get some more people on?î So

43:38.320 --> 43:43.040
he got some of his co-bloggers over there at Destructoid.com to come on as well and

43:43.040 --> 43:45.080
that was a fun little interview.

43:45.080 --> 43:49.480
I definitely need to check out more of their own podcast over there because Iím sure itís

43:49.480 --> 43:55.040
a riot, so check that out over at Destructoid.com, one of my favorite gaming blogs, by the way,

43:55.040 --> 43:56.040
and I mean that.

43:56.040 --> 43:58.400
Thatís the best side address ever.

43:58.400 --> 44:03.280
I like their little robot icon that they work into everything, so pretty cool.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.280
All right.

44:04.280 --> 44:06.280
Whoís coming on next, DarkSakura?

44:06.280 --> 44:09.840
I have Godfrey from Gamertag Radio.

44:09.840 --> 44:17.960
All right, Iím joined here now by Godfrey from Gamertag Radio.

44:17.960 --> 44:18.960
Godfrey, you there?

44:18.960 --> 44:19.960
Yeah, Iím here.

44:19.960 --> 44:20.960
Whatís going on, man?

44:20.960 --> 44:21.960
Hey, not a lot.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.680
How you doing?

44:23.680 --> 44:24.680
Everything good, man.

44:24.680 --> 44:25.680
Big fan of the show, man.

44:25.680 --> 44:26.680
Big fan.

44:26.680 --> 44:27.680
Thank you.

44:27.680 --> 44:28.680
Appreciate it.

44:28.680 --> 44:29.680
Weíre big fans of you guys as well.

44:29.680 --> 44:30.680
You guys have come a long way.

44:30.680 --> 44:34.320
Youíre what, going to be two years podcasting pretty soon?

44:34.320 --> 44:38.200
Yeah, itís going to be two years now in February.

44:38.200 --> 44:48.280
Iíve been also recording before that around 2000, 2001, like a Phantasy Star Online radio

44:48.280 --> 44:49.280
show.

44:49.280 --> 44:53.360
At that time, on the Dreamcast, it was like a big comedian.

44:53.360 --> 45:01.040
But I also used to help out these guys, gamingnoise.com, Chip and Zach, and I know all games, too.

45:01.040 --> 45:04.760
They used to do a radio show, too, at that time, 2001.

45:04.760 --> 45:05.760
Yeah, they were around.

45:05.760 --> 45:07.880
Just out of curiosity, Phantasy Star Universe was out this year.

45:07.880 --> 45:09.680
Did you kind of get on board with that?

45:09.680 --> 45:14.600
Yeah, I was playing a lot for a good month.

45:14.600 --> 45:19.440
But then, I donít know, I wasnít feeling it like how it used to be with the Dreamcast.

45:19.440 --> 45:22.440
It seemed more strict.

45:22.440 --> 45:25.240
Last time on the Dreamcast, it was more open.

45:25.240 --> 45:27.840
I donít know, it felt kind of different.

45:27.840 --> 45:31.840
I donít know if it was because of the next-gen consoles or, you know, I donít know.

45:31.840 --> 45:35.440
I just wasnít too thrilled with online gaming on that.

45:35.440 --> 45:36.680
Thatís all right.

45:36.680 --> 45:39.360
Now, I want to ask you about this, too.

45:39.360 --> 45:43.920
You guys have had a lot of Microsoft celebrities on your program this year, havenít you?

45:43.920 --> 45:45.160
Yes, a lot.

45:45.160 --> 45:50.760
Recently, we had an Xbox community, and we had a lot of people from the Xbox community,

45:50.760 --> 45:53.680
a lot of podcasters in there.

45:53.680 --> 45:59.720
And also, people from Microsoft came to the show to help us out and just thank the community

45:59.720 --> 46:02.680
that theyíve been helping out throughout the years.

46:02.680 --> 46:08.240
Major Nelson was there, Trixie, Peter Moore was also part of it, Aaron Greenberg.

46:08.240 --> 46:11.720
And itís been a great year for us, man.

46:11.720 --> 46:17.240
Weíve been busting our butts big time this year, and I want to thank everybody from Microsoft

46:17.240 --> 46:18.240
for helping us out.

46:18.240 --> 46:21.160
Yeah, it sounds like itís really paid off for you guys, so congratulations.

46:21.160 --> 46:23.320
Those are some big names to have on your show.

46:23.320 --> 46:24.320
Yeah, man.

46:24.320 --> 46:28.200
Yeah, I mean, we could do it, anybody could do it, you know, everybodyís just got to

46:28.200 --> 46:29.200
be dedicated, man.

46:29.200 --> 46:30.200
Absolutely.

46:30.200 --> 46:34.920
I want to ask you this as well, because your show is mostly centered around Xbox, but do

46:34.920 --> 46:38.840
you play Nintendo Wii, PlayStation, do you play the other consoles too?

46:38.840 --> 46:47.280
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I was camping out, man, trying to get the Nintendo Wii during

46:47.280 --> 46:48.280
launch day.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.840
I was in line for like at least 12 hours, man.

46:50.840 --> 46:51.840
Wow.

46:51.840 --> 46:52.840
Iíve been playing that here and there.

46:52.840 --> 47:00.680
Iíve only been playing Zelda for the Wii, and I downloaded a couple of virtual console

47:00.680 --> 47:01.680
games too.

47:01.680 --> 47:04.680
Thatís why Iíve been spending most of my timeÖ

47:04.680 --> 47:11.040
Iím just waiting to see if I can have more games in 2007, waiting for WarioWare, I played

47:11.040 --> 47:15.440
that too, and the Nintendo party, they were here in Miami a couple months ago before launch.

47:15.440 --> 47:16.440
Awesome.

47:16.440 --> 47:17.440
I like that game a lot.

47:17.440 --> 47:20.200
Yeah, I got to play WarioWare at E3, it was one of the few games that didnít have a mile

47:20.200 --> 47:21.200
long line.

47:21.200 --> 47:22.200
It was pretty fun.

47:22.200 --> 47:23.200
Yeah, itís different, man.

47:23.200 --> 47:28.200
Itís cool to get a group of people to play together in there, you know?

47:28.200 --> 47:33.040
Itís different than the other games in the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox.

47:33.040 --> 47:36.720
I think that gameís going to show us just why the Wii is a party console just as much

47:36.720 --> 47:37.720
as the GameCube.

47:37.720 --> 47:40.520
Yup, I think so too, man.

47:40.520 --> 47:46.160
Well, Godfrey, we got to get to the game weíre playing here, which is the Year 06 in review,

47:46.160 --> 47:51.000
and weíve started off with 15 boxes, but now we only have six left, so please, pick

47:51.000 --> 47:52.720
a number one through six.

47:52.720 --> 47:57.800
All right, so tell them whatís going on for this year, man.

47:57.800 --> 48:01.880
Well, you got to tell me whatís going on in 2006, you got to pick one of these boxes

48:01.880 --> 48:02.880
one through six.

48:02.880 --> 48:09.240
Let me pick number, let me pick number one, that sounds pretty cool.

48:09.240 --> 48:12.080
Number one, letís open it up.

48:12.080 --> 48:19.120
All right, we want to know your opinion, what did you think was the best handheld game in

48:19.120 --> 48:20.120
2006?

48:20.120 --> 48:21.120
Ooh, handheld.

48:21.120 --> 48:25.400
Ooh, thatís a good one, man.

48:25.400 --> 48:28.680
Iíve been playing a lot of BS.

48:28.680 --> 48:35.680
I have to say, in my opinion, Animal Crossing was really cool, Iíve been playing that a

48:35.680 --> 48:36.680
lot.

48:36.680 --> 48:40.440
Let me see, what else have I been playing, Luminous, also from the PSP, I know that came

48:40.440 --> 48:42.040
out, what was it last year that came out, though, right?

48:42.040 --> 48:43.840
But you did have Luminous 2 this year.

48:43.840 --> 48:49.360
No, Iíve been playing it, but Iíve been playing a lot of Luminous from the Xbox 360.

48:49.360 --> 48:55.560
So out of all those games youíve played, which one would you say was the best?

48:55.560 --> 49:00.360
Which version, from the Luminous or from the PSP or the Xbox?

49:00.360 --> 49:03.560
For any handheld system, which game would you say was the best?

49:03.560 --> 49:04.560
Animal Crossing, man.

49:04.560 --> 49:08.640
I had a lot of fun with Animal Crossing this year, Iíve been playing that a lot, a lot.

49:08.640 --> 49:12.880
I mean, yeah, thatís the only game Iíve been playing a lot on the handheld this year.

49:12.880 --> 49:17.480
Itís pretty addicting, I mean, you can go online with it and go visit other peopleís

49:17.480 --> 49:21.400
towns, and it seems like it doesnít really end, ever, that game.

49:21.400 --> 49:26.640
Exactly, and not only that, itís based on real time, too, so itís like I wake up and

49:26.640 --> 49:30.320
Iíll be like, ìAll right, itís daytime over here,î and I could go online and I might

49:30.320 --> 49:34.800
go to somebody else that the time is ahead in their town, letís say for somebody from

49:34.800 --> 49:41.680
maybe Europe or Japan, and their town is based on their time, so itís like, ìOh, man, itís

49:41.680 --> 49:46.200
nighttime over here, let me check it out,î and itís cool, because I know Animal Crossing

49:46.200 --> 49:47.640
has a great community, too.

49:47.640 --> 49:54.720
I donít know if youíve been checking out a couple of websites called animalcrossingcommunity.com,

49:54.720 --> 49:59.920
where people can exchange their friend codes and exchange items and help each other out

49:59.920 --> 50:00.920
and stuff.

50:00.920 --> 50:01.920
I donít know, I find that really cool, man.

50:01.920 --> 50:08.160
Itís different from a lot of other games handheld, so, you know, thatís what it is.

50:08.160 --> 50:15.720
I know that game was in the GameCube, but one thing that was missing was the online

50:15.720 --> 50:20.720
park, which, when it came out on the DS, I know a lot of people enjoyed that a lot, too.

50:20.720 --> 50:25.840
Now, Iím sure Animal Crossing on the Wii will be inevitable, so, you know, you will

50:25.840 --> 50:29.040
give me your friend code at that point, let me come chop down your trees, right?

50:29.040 --> 50:34.800
Oh, for sure, man, yeah, but get ready, because Iím going to go to your town and do the same.

50:34.800 --> 50:36.800
All right, sounds good.

50:36.800 --> 50:40.000
We want to get your opinion on a news story as well, of course, weíre going down the

50:40.000 --> 50:43.880
highlights of 2006, and Iíve got to say, youíve got a good one here.

50:43.880 --> 50:50.200
Actually, you have an audio Daily Double here for the news story, so letís go to the audio.

50:50.200 --> 50:53.480
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Harai.

50:53.480 --> 50:56.160
Ridge Racer.

50:56.160 --> 51:02.560
The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change, and the consumers are ready.

51:02.560 --> 51:07.280
Genji 2 is an Ashen game, which is based on Japanese history.

51:07.280 --> 51:09.620
Ridge Racer.

51:09.620 --> 51:15.800
Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles,

51:15.800 --> 51:18.480
which actually took place in ancient Japan.

51:18.480 --> 51:22.120
So hereís this giant enemy crab.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.640
Ridge Racer.

51:24.640 --> 51:28.760
And you attack its weak point for massive damage.

51:28.760 --> 51:30.840
Itís Ridge Racer.

51:30.840 --> 51:32.840
Ridge Racer.

51:32.840 --> 51:46.960
E3 will retail for $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, itís Ridge

51:46.960 --> 51:47.960
Racer.

51:47.960 --> 51:48.960
Ridge Racer.

51:48.960 --> 51:56.600
Yes, thatís right, itís Sonyís infamous press conference from E3, where they got taunted

51:56.600 --> 51:58.480
incessantly afterwards.

51:58.480 --> 52:02.200
Godfrey, were you at E3 this year, watching it online?

52:02.200 --> 52:10.400
As a matter of fact, that day during the press conference, Iím also part of the Xbox MVPs

52:10.400 --> 52:11.400
from Microsoft.

52:11.400 --> 52:18.400
Itís a lot of community members that got invited to E3, and we were there, you know,

52:18.400 --> 52:22.840
having a couple meetings, talking about the Xbox, and then all of us got together and

52:22.840 --> 52:26.280
wanted to see the press conference of Sony, because thatís when they were announcing

52:26.280 --> 52:34.160
the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii during E3, so we were watching it, and I donít know,

52:34.160 --> 52:37.360
it was very, very boring, like the presentation.

52:37.360 --> 52:41.800
I think Nintendo did a really good job this year presenting the Wii and also Microsoft

52:41.800 --> 52:47.600
with the Xbox 360, but I donít know, Sony was just like straight up boring, and I donít

52:47.600 --> 52:51.840
know why it was the hype or the system, you know, like everybody was like, ìOh my God,

52:51.840 --> 52:59.480
the graphics are going to be amazing,î and look, ever since E3, that happened, look now

52:59.480 --> 53:02.880
like theyíve been getting a lot of bad press ever since, you know?

53:02.880 --> 53:05.620
What do you think caused all that bad press?

53:05.620 --> 53:06.840
Was it the price tag?

53:06.840 --> 53:09.920
Was it the giant enemy crabs line, the Ridge Racer?

53:09.920 --> 53:12.480
What caused all the bad press, do you think?

53:12.480 --> 53:17.920
Oh man, I think everything combined, but I think the most was the price, man.

53:17.920 --> 53:22.560
You know it is, a lot of people have been busting their butts, man, just to try to get

53:22.560 --> 53:28.000
a game because now games are like $60, you know, $59.99, itís like people got to be

53:28.000 --> 53:32.840
really picky on what theyíre going to purchase, and itís like people are lining up, getting

53:32.840 --> 53:39.520
the PlayStation 3, and once they got it, it felt like it was rushed, you know?

53:39.520 --> 53:45.320
I think Sony was under pressure big time because of Xbox, especially here in the United States.

53:45.320 --> 53:51.520
I know in Japan, theyíre probably concentrating more on the competition with Nintendo, but

53:51.520 --> 53:58.240
I donít know, it just, it feels rushed, and itís like the online part, itís not like

53:58.240 --> 54:00.320
how it is with the 360.

54:00.320 --> 54:05.280
I think people are having a better time connecting online with the places in portable than the

54:05.280 --> 54:11.840
places in 3, and now with exclusives, itís like Assassinís Creed is coming out of 360,

54:11.840 --> 54:18.400
like slowly, a lot of Sony fans are going to go and purchase the other consoles because

54:18.400 --> 54:19.400
they donít have no choice.

54:19.400 --> 54:25.320
They canít find a console in stores or, you know, thereís not many great games, so right

54:25.320 --> 54:31.000
now only Resistance is an okay title for the Sony, so I donít know, man.

54:31.000 --> 54:36.000
What do you think Sony can do to give themselves some good press in 2007, to really turn their

54:36.000 --> 54:38.960
car around and get back on track?

54:38.960 --> 54:42.280
I think itís the games, man, itís all about the software, man.

54:42.280 --> 54:47.960
If they have the right games, and itís fun, I think that slowly is going to pick up more

54:47.960 --> 54:53.480
people to get the places in 3, and also they should lower the price, man, $600 is a little

54:53.480 --> 54:55.780
bit too much.

54:55.780 --> 55:02.200
I think they were very gassed up that they sold a lot of units with the places in 2,

55:02.200 --> 55:06.740
and they thought they were going to do the same thing with places in 3, no matter what

55:06.740 --> 55:11.440
price it is, and look, now theyíre struggling, you know, itís like, I know theyíre going

55:11.440 --> 55:15.480
to learn from that, man, so hopefully next year theyíre going to lower down the price,

55:15.480 --> 55:16.480
man.

55:16.480 --> 55:20.960
Theyíve got a lot riding, too, on Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy 13, kind of the

55:20.960 --> 55:24.600
only big, big, big exclusives I can think of that are left, soÖ

55:24.600 --> 55:30.720
As a matter of fact, I think places in 2, this year, in the Christmas season, they had

55:30.720 --> 55:36.240
a lot of great games, man, a lot like Bully, the new Final Fantasy, theyíve been getting

55:36.240 --> 55:43.120
a lot of great games, man, I think thatís what they need, man, they need companies,

55:43.120 --> 55:47.760
you know, to create great games for the system, you know, and especially first-party-wise,

55:47.760 --> 55:53.760
they donít have no great games right now on the system, so Nintendo and Microsoft are

55:53.760 --> 55:56.920
coming strong with the first-party titles, you know.

55:56.920 --> 56:01.120
Well, speaking of great games, thatís a good segue into what we want to ask you next, Godfrey,

56:01.120 --> 56:06.360
weíre tallying it up all night long, what do you believe was the best video game of

56:06.360 --> 56:07.360
2006?

56:07.360 --> 56:10.240
Well, to me, man, I think it was Gears of War, man.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.240
Gears of War.

56:11.240 --> 56:12.240
Gears of War.

56:12.240 --> 56:13.240
Yeah, Gears of War.

56:13.240 --> 56:21.360
I mean, I know itís not a perfect game, but I think, like, graphic-wise, the sound, everything

56:21.360 --> 56:24.120
put together was, like, amazing in that game, man.

56:24.120 --> 56:28.400
The only thing that was really lacking was the story, but itís okay, I think Iíve been

56:28.400 --> 56:32.960
having a blast, like, playing a lot with my friends and with my brother, weíve been doing

56:32.960 --> 56:34.320
co-op and all that.

56:34.320 --> 56:41.200
I think thatís, to me, like, the best game for 2006, Gears of War, and I think the sleeper

56:41.200 --> 56:44.360
hit also was Viva Pinata, in my opinion, man.

56:44.360 --> 56:45.360
Really?

56:45.360 --> 56:47.760
Yeah, I think so.

56:47.760 --> 56:54.200
I think Microsoft did a horrible job promoting the game, I think they were promoting too

56:54.200 --> 57:00.400
much on Gears of War, and the tension just went away when Viva came out, you know?

57:00.400 --> 57:02.640
So I think that game is really fun.

57:02.640 --> 57:08.040
Personally, I see this game more for older crowd, because itís a little bit too confusing

57:08.040 --> 57:09.040
for kids.

57:09.040 --> 57:15.460
Godfrey, I would have never have guessed that someone whoís been doing this radio program

57:15.460 --> 57:21.920
about the Xbox and the hip-hop community combined was secretly an Animal Crossing and Viva Pinata

57:21.920 --> 57:22.920
fan.

57:22.920 --> 57:23.920
Yeah, man.

57:23.920 --> 57:24.920
I donít know about that, you know?

57:24.920 --> 57:25.920
It doesnít think at all.

57:25.920 --> 57:26.920
Itís great.

57:26.920 --> 57:27.920
You know, itís great.

57:27.920 --> 57:28.920
You know what it is, man?

57:28.920 --> 57:29.920
Itís innovation, man.

57:29.920 --> 57:34.480
People, companies just gotta come out, like, different, man, like, thatís the same thing

57:34.480 --> 57:35.480
with music.

57:35.480 --> 57:39.920
When everybodyís doing the same thing, it gets boring, you know, and thatís why I love

57:39.920 --> 57:45.680
Nintendo, what theyíre doing with the Wii control, and itís just different, itís like

57:45.680 --> 57:47.640
having a different experience while playing the game.

57:47.640 --> 57:51.720
Itís like, you feel like, when youíre playing Zelda on the Wii, you think youíre in the

57:51.720 --> 57:52.720
game, you know?

57:52.720 --> 57:54.200
Itís totally different, man, soÖ

57:54.200 --> 57:55.200
All right.

57:55.200 --> 58:00.200
Well, now, speaking of something totally different, what do you believe was the worst game of

58:00.200 --> 58:01.760
2006, Godfrey?

58:01.760 --> 58:03.760
Wow, worst game!

58:03.760 --> 58:14.920
Man, I have two choices, either Superman from the Xbox 360 or this game too, Totonball.

58:14.920 --> 58:19.920
They was actually free for the Xbox Live arcade with the, you could control with the Xbox

58:19.920 --> 58:20.920
Live Vision camera.

58:20.920 --> 58:21.920
Yeah.

58:21.920 --> 58:24.200
It was a really bad game.

58:24.200 --> 58:28.120
I was playing it, and I just got tired playing it, like, my arms was, like, falling asleep

58:28.120 --> 58:29.120
trying toÖ

58:29.120 --> 58:31.720
I donít know if you got the chance to play that game or not.

58:31.720 --> 58:35.640
I, unfortunately, did, and was bored of it in about five minutes.

58:35.640 --> 58:40.120
I mean, I unlocked one achievement, so after I unlocked that achievement, I was like, ìOh,

58:40.120 --> 58:41.120
right.î

58:41.120 --> 58:43.320
There was one achievement I got really easy by playing the pinball game.

58:43.320 --> 58:46.240
Like, there was another game in it that was, like, a pinball game, and I played it for,

58:46.240 --> 58:48.280
like, two minutes, and I got an achievement somehow.

58:48.280 --> 58:49.280
Oh, okay.

58:49.280 --> 58:53.920
I seen you download it, you get an achievement, I guess.

58:53.920 --> 58:56.760
You actually played this piece of crap.

58:56.760 --> 58:57.760
Five points.

58:57.760 --> 58:58.760
Yeah, man.

58:58.760 --> 58:59.760
I donít know.

58:59.760 --> 59:00.760
I wouldnít waste my time on that, man.

59:00.760 --> 59:03.160
Thereís a lot of great games on Xbox Live Arcade.

59:03.160 --> 59:04.480
Donít even bother with that one.

59:04.480 --> 59:07.760
Iím putting you down for Totonball, because you ran it a lot longer on that one than you

59:07.760 --> 59:08.760
did Superman.

59:08.760 --> 59:09.760
Yeah.

59:09.760 --> 59:10.760
All right, all right.

59:10.760 --> 59:11.760
Cool, cool.

59:11.760 --> 59:16.480
Out of curiosity, do you think the Xbox camera, because, you know, Totonball is kind of, like,

59:16.480 --> 59:18.400
the camera game for Xbox 360.

59:18.400 --> 59:22.520
Does the Xbox 360 camera, can it serve a better purpose than this?

59:22.520 --> 59:24.600
Yeah, I think so, man.

59:24.600 --> 59:31.200
I mean, I know during the holidays, one of my good friends, he used to be a, heís a

59:31.200 --> 59:35.560
podcaster, too, but now he works with Microsoft, Chris Paladino.

59:35.560 --> 59:41.740
His family, he moved to Seattle ever since he got a job at Microsoft, and during Christmas,

59:41.740 --> 59:45.120
they got together with his family in the East Coast and him in the West Coast, and they

59:45.120 --> 59:50.640
used the Xbox Live Vision camera to talk, and during Christmas, they went opening presents

59:50.640 --> 59:54.960
and all that, so it felt like they were, like, together, you know?

59:54.960 --> 59:55.960
Thatís nice.

59:55.960 --> 01:00:01.320
I think by that, or playing games like Uno online, I think itís a great purpose to play

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.320
that, man.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.320
All right.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.680
Well, Godfrey, thanks so much for being here on the show today.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.680
What do you guys have planned over there at GamerTag Radio for 2007?

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:14.600
Yeah, right now, weíre hopefully, in 2007, weíre going to launch, weíre going to still

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:21.120
continue with the audio shows, podcasts, and also, weíre working on a video podcast, weíre

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:27.480
working on that, and one of my staff members, Pink Sage, is also working on a project, like

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.560
a GamerTag Radio magazine.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.200
Right now, weíre keeping it on hold, but itís going to be really cool, man.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.440
Itís going to be something different, and weíre still going to be concentrating on

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:41.520
the community, because thereís a lot of websites thatís not getting known, and weíre trying

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:47.280
to support them so they can get their name out there.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.520
We can have a lot of interviews.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.880
Are you guys planning to go to CES this year?

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.080
I donít think any of us are signed up for CES this year, but weíre kind of holding

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.440
out to see, hopefully, about the new E3, and probably that GamePro Expo, and some various

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.400
anime conventions weíll be going to this year.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.800
Just donít know about CES, because thereís usually not a lot of game content.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:05.800
Okay.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:12.320
Yeah, well, weíre planning to go to CES, and also got invited to a community event

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:19.560
in Canada by EA, the NBA Street home court thatís coming out for the Xbox 360 also.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:23.560
Well, weíll just wait for your video, and Iíll download it to my video iPod, and itíll

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.560
be like I was there.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.560
All right, there you go.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.560
All right.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:31.560
I want to thank you, and everybody, support Orange Lodge, man.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.560
Iím a big fan.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:33.560
Thank you.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.560
Thatís what we got to do.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.160
We got to get together all the podcasters, and I continue to work.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.920
We do a lot of talking about that, independent podcasts supporting each other, and thatís

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.960
what we wanted to do tonight with our New Yearís special is really bring everybody

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.960
together.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.960
So really, we want to thank you for being on board and coming on with this, especially

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:56.400
you guys have had a lot of success, so weíre very happy you havenít forgotten your independent

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.400
roots.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.840
Tell everybody real quick how they can check out your show, if they want to.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:06.520
Yeah, they could go on gamertagradio.com, and we have all the shows in there, and also

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.040
on iTunes, they could check it out and subscribe to the show.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.040
All right.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.040
Go there right now, everyone, gamertagradio.com.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.160
Godfrey, thanks so much.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.360
Happy holidays, and good luck in 2007, all right?

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.360
Happy holidays, man.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.360
All right.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.360
Take care, man.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:24.400
Thanks a lot.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.260
Big thanks to Godfrey from Gamertag Radio for coming on, and heís been doing his show

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.260
a long time.

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:34.560
He did not realize that before he was podcasting, he actually did another type of recordable

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:40.240
show, so thatís pretty cool, and I love the fact that heís an Animal Crossing fan, Viva

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.240
Pinata fan.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.240
Thatís cute.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.520
You two should be the best of friends, Dark Soccer, because you never shut up about Animal

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.640
Crossing on this program.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.960
I did when I got bored with it.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.240
Just imagine when it comes out for the Wii.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.240
I know.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.800
Thatís what we were saying there at the end there is that I cannot wait to go to his village

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.680
on the Wii and chop down all his trees and send his villagers some nasty e-mails.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.720
Thatíll be tons of fun, wonít it?

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:06.360
Anyway, we still have some boxes left to open here in studio, so weíre going to go around

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:11.480
and have some folks open the remaining boxes, Dark Soccer and Loki, but also we brought

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:16.400
in some other guests live, some folks from Orange Lounge Radio, past and present, so

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.600
say hello first to Rice Princess.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.100
How you doing, maíam?

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.100
Pretty good.

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:22.100
How about you?

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.100
Good.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.360
Now, you used to come on Orange Lounge Radio way back in the day.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:28.960
You came on the Wednesday show with me, and we had a lot of fun there, but what have you

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.960
been up to in 2006?

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.200
We havenít heard a lot of you in 2006.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:35.840
A good majority of it has been World of Warcraft.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.840
World of Warcraft?

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.840
Yep.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.840
Are you looking forward to Burning Crusade?

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.840
Hell yeah.

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.840
All right.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.840
Yep.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.840
All right.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:43.840
You ready to open up a box?

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.840
Sure.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.840
All right.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.560
Thereís five boxes left on the table, Rice Princess, one through five.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.440
Which one of those do you want to open?

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.440
Box number three, Rob.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.440
All right.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.440
Letís open it up.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.120
All right.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:02.480
The gaming category we want to know your opinion on, game I liked this year that no one else

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.760
seemed to.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.200
The game you liked this year that no one else seemed to.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.640
Oh, thatís a hard one.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.100
I didnít do a lot of console gaming this year, and everything that I did play on consoles

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:19.280
was pretty well received, so I donít know if I have an answer for that.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.280
Uh-oh.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.280
Yeah.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.280
What do you think?

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.480
Um, well, uh, Elibits.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.200
There you go.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:33.400
Well, Elibits did get some bad reviews from some gaming press out there, so I guess thatíll

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.400
work.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.400
I have no idea.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.400
That just kind of came out of my head.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.400
That works.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.400
Weíll take it.

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.400
Okay.

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.400
I have never even played it.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:46.360
I just watched it last night for the first time.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:50.360
Itís the one that came to most recent memory, so there you go.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.320
This is why she hasnít been on the network in a year and a half, ladies and gentlemen.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.320
Cry, cry, cry.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.320
Just kidding.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.320
We still love you.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.320
Yay.

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.320
Well, what were some games that you liked that everyone liked then?

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.320
Kingdom Hearts 2 came out this past year, right?

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.320
That was one.

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.560
I actually did play that.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:09.880
Final Fantasy XII was really good.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.280
Twilight Princess was great.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.680
I havenít actually played it, but Iíve seen it played, and it looks awesome.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:18.680
Yeah, just the bigger ones that everyone knows about.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:22.160
Hereís a news story we want to get your opinion on, and that would beóand oh, this is a good

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.320
one for youóare you a big fan of the Xbox?

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.320
No.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.920
Then Iím sure youíre going to love this one.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.520
What we want to know your opinion on is what do you think of the Halo 3 madness going on

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.520
out there?

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.840
Halo 3 was announced at E3 this year, and itís been building and building.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:43.540
Thereís been all this crazy press coverage leading into a release next year of the game.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:48.240
How important is Halo 3 to the Xbox 360 in 2007?

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.520
Iím pretty sure itís going to be one of the pillars.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:57.280
Iím sure itís going to be one of the big sellers, but me personally, I donít care.

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.280
I donít give a shit.

01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.280
Whatever.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.640
Why donít you care about Halo 3?

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.280
Because I didnít care about the first two.

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.280
I didnít play them.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.280
I donít care.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.040
Are you just not a first-person shooter fan?

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.040
Not really, no.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.040
All right.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.040
Sorry to hear it.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.040
Yeah.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.040
Okay.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:16.280
Well, Rice Princess, what in your opinion was the best video game of 2006?

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.280
Something that came out in 2006?

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.280
Yeah.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.280
So you canít do World of Warcraft.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.280
Sorry.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.280
Yeah.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.280
Dang it.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.280
Iím going to say Kingdom Hearts 2.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.280
I really enjoyed it.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.280
Itís a good game.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.280
Kingdom Hearts is fun.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.280
Yeah.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.280
It is.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.280
It really is.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.280
All right.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.280
Is it just because of the story, or is it the action?

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.280
Because some people say this gameís too easy.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.280
You just hit X, X, X all the time.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.280
Yeah.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.240
The actionís pretty much the same as the first one, so itís not like they really did

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.880
a lot with that, but the story was really, really good.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.880
All right.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.880
Yeah.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.720
Whatís the best game of 2006, Rice Princess?

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.520
Chirp, chirp.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.720
I donít really know.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.120
I canít make an informed decision on that.

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:56.440
Iím sure thereís a lot of bad games.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:59.360
There wasnít anything you played that you were just like, ìWhat a crap.î

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.360
No, not really.

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.360
Really?

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.360
I donít play crap.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:03.360
Okay?

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.360
Thatís why.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.400
Then just say Sonic or Bomberman.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.400
Sonic or Bomberman, or both.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.400
All right.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.240
Then weíre not putting anything down for you, and you suck.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.880
You need to resolve to play more games in 2007.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.880
Oh, my God.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.880
Thatís a great resolution.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.880
Iíll do that.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.880
All right.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:19.880
I promise.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:20.880
All right.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.760
Letís move over to Extafur is joining us as well from our program.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:23.760
How you doing, Extafur?

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.760
Good, and you?

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.760
Good.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.880
Now, youíve become more of a gamer in 2006 than you were in 2005, huh?

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.880
Yeah.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.880
And why would you say that?

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.780
Because of your Wii.

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:35.780
Pretty much.

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:36.780
My Wii has that effect on people, apparently.

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:37.780
Yeah.

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:40.240
I play your Wii all the time nightly, really.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.080
And donít help those rumors that are going around, Extafur.

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.080
Iíve watched him do it, too.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.080
It was great.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.080
And by your Wii, I mean penis.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.080
Did I get that?

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.680
Did I not?

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:52.200
Like I said, please, those rumors are bad enough as it is.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.200
Oh.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.200
All right.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.400
Well, so do you feel like maybe youíre pretty well informed to make some decisions on the

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.400
best and worst game of 2006?

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.400
I think so.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:00.400
All right.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.080
What would you say was the best game of 2006, Extafur?

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.880
Best game of 2006, Excite Truck.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.880
Wow.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.880
Really?

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:07.880
Why?

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.080
Because I unlocked everything in it.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:14.920
I played it for hours and hours, and I must like it because I played it for hours and

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.920
hours.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:21.520
So amongst Burnout, Test Drive Unlimited, you choose Excite Truck.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.520
Yes.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.160
Why is this game so damn appealing?

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.560
Because you know, a lot of hardcore gamers are passing on Excite Truck.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.560
I know.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:28.560
Because they say itís too junky.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.440
They need to play it more, is what I say.

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.300
Because thereís a learning curve to it, but once you get past the learning curve, itís

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:36.300
so much fun.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:43.240
And I donít understand, you know, itís not the graphics, itís not the, you know, trophies

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.560
or achievements or anything like that, itís the actual gameplay.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:51.920
I really, really like the gameplay, and I like the challenges and everything.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:55.280
And on top of that are all the achievements and all the other things that you get.

01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:08.520
Alright, well everyone here at Orange Longs Radio is welcome to their opinion, even if

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.520
theyíre wrong.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.520
Which you are in this case.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.520
No, Iím just kidding.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.520
No, Excite Truckís a lot of fun.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.520
I think it was underrated.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.520
I think, I really do think it was underrated.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.520
Yeah.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:16.520
I think when it came to racing games this year, I think I like Burnout a little more

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.520
because thereís more fire than there is in Excite Truck.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.520
Yeah.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.520
No, no Excite Truck was better.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.520
Alright.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.520
Well, what was the worst game of 2006 in your opinion?

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.520
Well, I actually have to jump on the bandwagon and say Sonic the Hedgehog, because I actually

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.520
played that.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.680
Iíve only been really getting into video games heavily within the last two months,

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.320
I would say, like in the last year or whatever, you know.

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:36.420
So like, and that was one of the games I played, and that was so god-awful, I just could not

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:37.420
play it.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.240
I just, it was just god-damn awful.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.480
But you played the old Sonics, right?

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.480
Yeah.

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.480
And you loved those games.

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:46.440
My favorite, one of my favorite games ever is Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.760
So where did Sega fuck up?

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.680
They just, they went, see, and I liked Sonic Adventure when it came out for the Dreamcast.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.520
I really liked that game, so I think they can do it right when they do 3D.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:02.400
But I just, I think their execution and the control and everything was just, it was too

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.920
much this time.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.360
And they could execute it right, because I did like that other game.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.320
Alright, well thereís four boxes left on the table.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.760
Tell me which box do you want to open.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.320
Box number two.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.960
Like, shit.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.120
Thatís what number two is.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:26.840
Alright, letís open up box number two for extrovert.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:32.760
What did you think was the best retro revival of 2006, meaning the best game that made it

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.840
like a comeback in 2006?

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.440
I donít have an answer for that, because I donít.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.400
You better come up with one.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:50.320
I think that the best, Iím going to say Bomberman Act Zero.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.640
Why Bomberman Act Zero?

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:56.960
Because it was so goddamn stylish, and they just raped all the gamers on that one.

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.120
I just have to, I have to give it to them.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.080
Wasnít it Konami that made that game?

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.600
Yeah, I think so, Hudsonís Branch or whatever, yeah.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.560
Good job, what I have to say.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.000
Best revival ever.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.880
Iím having, Iím getting an orgasm in my pants just thinking about it.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:16.400
Well, speaking of which, we want to know your opinion on news stories.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.760
The Nintendo console, because youíve been playing a lot of the Wii, and one big news

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:23.720
story this year was that originally that system was going to be called the Nintendo Revolution,

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:24.720
right?

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.840
But they changed their mind somewhere along the line, and they decided that the name of

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:34.480
the console was going to be the Nintendo Wii, and folks just, you know, they went nuts.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:38.200
They said, like, you know, they made every Wii joke under the sun, and still do to this

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200
day.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.480
What was your reaction when you heard that Nintendoís new console was going to be called

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:42.480
the Wii?

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:49.640
I think it was a lot like everyone elseís, like, huh, like, what, I donít understand

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:55.480
how you can go from revolution to Wii, but then it really was a good business decision

01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:01.760
on their part, I think, because people, itís different, you know, and youíll remember

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:02.760
Wii.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:06.880
I mean, you will, itís just one fucking syllable, you know, itís like, I said fucking right

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:13.680
there, but anyhow, itís one fucking syllable, and thereís also, you know, thereís just,

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:18.560
everybody knows what it is, you know, it was easier to market, I think, when, if it was

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:24.360
the Nintendo Revolution, it would, I think, be going back, you know, going backwards,

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.520
because youíre used to having video game consoles with those kinds of names, you know.

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.080
And penis jokes, have you been making a lot of Wii jokes this year?

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:36.360
Actually, yes, I have, Iíve been Can you tell us one of your best Wii jokes?

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:45.160
No, no I canít, actually, I can say, though, that when I was waiting in line for the Wii,

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:51.080
you pretty much heard every, every Wii joke you could possibly hear, and that was kind

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.640
of amusing, because everybody was just making them all night.

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:56.360
I think a lot of them originated from our part of the line.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.400
I wasnít there, I was sleeping.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.400
Yeah.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.240
I played with my Wii and then went to sleep.

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.580
We woke you up.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.580
It did.

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:11.280
Anyway, letís thank you guys to Xtifer and Rice Princess, thank you guys for coming on,

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.280
we appreciate it.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:17.580
Alright, thereís three boxes left on the table, and hey, three hosts for the show,

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.920
so Dark Sakura, one, two, or three?

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.200
Uh, well, um, two.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.760
Two, you want two, alright, letís, oh, youíll let this one.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.760
Itís an even number.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.280
Alright, here we go, box number two.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.800
Dark Sakura, the best party game of 2006.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:38.120
Oh, fuck, I donít play party games.

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.320
Everybody in the studio is getting one they canít do.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.320
I changed my box.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.320
No, you canít change the box.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.320
I returned this one for store credit.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.320
Nope, canít do that.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.680
Wasnít there a game that people would get together at your house and play a lot this

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.680
year?

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:51.680
No.

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.680
Madden.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:53.680
Fuck.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:54.680
Madden.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.680
No.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:01.440
Um, okay, Iím gonna have to go though, Iím gonna go universal with party and say Animal

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:02.440
Crossing.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.440
Oh, okay.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:09.160
Because I got so many dirty letters from my friends, and so many people, I had someone

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:14.160
going around in my village calling everyone a wanker, and then I had someone else say

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.160
shit face, and it was great.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.160
Thatís so mature.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.160
Thatís awesome.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:24.760
And, you know, putting, you know, putting dirty t-shirts in my shop, and it was pretty

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.760
fun.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:26.760
Alright.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.500
Now, the news story we want to know your opinion on, and that would be, remember when Bully,

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.160
the game Bully on the Playstation 2 was first released?

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:37.720
Which controversy when they discovered that your character, a boy, can kiss another boy

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:38.720
in the game?

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:41.720
What did you think about that whole controversy?

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:46.840
I thought that I really didnít care, because it was kind of, I was like, thatís cool,

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.240
but these people are stupid.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.240
What people?

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:50.840
The people who were all up in arms over it.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.240
Like Tack Jomsom?

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.240
Oh, God.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:59.580
Thatís somebody who just needs to get butt raped with a corn cob.

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:03.520
Do they need to do more of this type of content in games?

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.520
Yes.

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.120
We need more hot gay action.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.840
Do you think gay gaming is fairly represented in games today?

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.320
Well, not really, because I think a lot of itís more sensationalized, you know, because

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:19.520
like, oh, if we put two hot chicks, you know, kissing, then itíll attract the straight

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.520
white male quotient.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:25.660
No, they just need to have, like, actual just, they need what they need to, and I think this

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:29.900
was in any media, they need to remove the sensational aspect from it and just make it

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:31.480
like any other thing.

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.480
You know?

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.480
Itís normal.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:39.080
There are a vast number of people in the world who have normal, you know, I donít think

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:42.920
that there should be any distinction made between, oh, straight people are normal, oh,

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:47.800
gay people, you know, that big thing, it should just be no big deal.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.820
So yeah, so you think that they donít need to go out of their way to incorporate gay

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:52.820
content in the games either?

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:57.120
I think it should just be, you know, if this, if youíve written this character and this

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.760
character, you know, sets off your gaydar, have them fuck a guy, I donít know.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:05.720
Then everything should be like The Sims, where itís just played however the hell you want.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:12.520
The Sims is the best, the best, I think, way theyíve done it, because itís either or,

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:17.640
you know, and thereís tons of gay couples out there who adopt children, who, you know,

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.840
get themselves artificially inseminated, who adopt, you know, I think that it should just

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:27.040
be no big deal, it should just be, because I think, and this is how I feel about a lot

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:31.120
of stuff, is that whenever you make a big deal about something, thereís gonna be other

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.300
people who make a big deal about it, who treat it as some sort of pet topic, when really

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:38.520
it should just be average, it should just be accepted.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.520
All right.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.520
So thatís what I think.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:41.520
All right.

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.520
Thanks for your opinion.

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:46.320
Now, we also want to know, what did you think was the best game of 2006, Dark Sakura?

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.320
Cookie Mama.

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:50.080
Why did I think you were gonna say that?

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:54.360
Out of all the games, out of the Kingdom Hearts II, the Final Fantasy XII, the Oblivion, the

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.280
Gears of War, you pick Cookie Mama.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.960
Because Iím still playing it, and Iíve been playing it, and I havenít put it down.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:03.280
Whatís so great, whatís so freaking great about Cookie Mama?

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.880
Pulling the head off a shrimp.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.200
Chopping up meat.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:10.960
Are you excited about Cookie Mama Wii thatís coming out next year?

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.560
Yeah, yeah, I want my Cookie Mama Wii.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:17.080
Worst game of 2006, Dark Sakura?

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:21.040
I mean, Sonic, honestly.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.040
I canít help it.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.480
It was a complete and utter shite.

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.400
I just was like, ìOh my God, itís a bad Sonic game.î

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.800
And you have been a Sega fangirl for the longest time, so I ask you what I asked X to for.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:34.800
Where did Sega go wrong?

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:42.240
First of all, putting it on the PS3, and second of all, really crap control.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:51.360
I mean, overall, it looked like it had a lot of potential, but thereís so much glitchy

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.360
bullshit in it.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:58.120
I think if they tightened up the control, or maybe even, I donít know if they did,

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:04.600
but used the engine from Sonic Adventure, even with the glitches in that game, you could

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.560
still play through it, and it was a good game.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:11.000
They need to really have that tightness of control that Sonic Adventure had.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.680
Alright, well thanks for your opinion.

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:14.400
We know you always like to interject it.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.720
My opinion is awesome.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:17.680
Loki, thereís two boxes left.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:18.680
One or two.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:19.760
Donít be reading off the screen.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.760
One or two.

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:21.760
I canít see the screen.

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:22.760
Good.

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.760
Two.

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:28.600
Iím so glad you picked this one.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.920
Best sports title in 2006.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.600
Best sports title in 2006.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:37.160
Actually, I would think...

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:42.920
Not Tecmo Bowl, they didnít release Tecmo, well I guess Title Legends, no, Title Legends

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.920
was last year.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:51.880
I would say actually, probably Wii Sports, since thatís really, you know, kind of everyone

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:52.880
liked that.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:57.080
It was universally liked, and where itís like, you know, any EA sports game is pretty

01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:01.640
much, you know, youíre either a fan of it or, so Wii Sports was kind of that game that

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:04.720
got people to cross over, even people that were like, ìI hate Madden, I donít want

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.960
to play Madden,î which, you know, can be me sometimes.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:08.960
I loved Wii Sports.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:09.960
It was awesome.

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:14.000
Yeah, Wii Sports was fun, and Madden, Iím sure, on the Wii is probably pretty fun.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.560
I know a lot of people were getting into that, that donít normally like football.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:22.760
I donít follow sports, so, you know, to play a sports game is just kind of, eh.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:27.320
I donít know what, you know, who anyone is, or what the teamís, you know, strengths and

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.800
weaknesses are.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:32.280
You kind of have to be a fan of the sport to be able to play the game well, you know,

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:36.160
because you have to know the strengths of each player and stuff, and since I donít

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:40.920
do that, nor, you know, I wouldnít be able to be any good at it.

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.360
I have to ask you about this one, because, yeah, I think Wii Sports would have been my

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.680
answer to this, too, but if I went outside that and wanted to pick an actual sports title,

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:50.080
I think I actually would have picked Rockstarís Table Tennis.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.200
Did you like that game?

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:57.040
I didnít really play that game that much, and, no, Table Tennis, you know, I still have

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.000
trouble thinking that thatís a sport.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Itís fun.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.920
It was way better than, like, Topspin 2 was.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.680
That was, like, one of the worst games I played this year.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.680
I donít know.

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:08.760
I would say if I was going to pick a sports game, I would, you know, thatís even last

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:09.760
year, though.

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:13.240
I was going to say Project Gotham Racing 3, because racing is a sport.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.240
True.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.240
All right, all right.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:20.960
And so, if I were to say this year, then maybe best sports game, you know, Burnoutís not

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:21.960
a sport.

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:22.960
That doesnít really count.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.440
All right, and that leaves you with this news topic.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.880
Iím so excited you got this one.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:31.560
One thing that Sony announced at their press conference that suddenly kind of seemed to

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:35.200
disappear throughout the year was the Eye of Judgment.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:40.840
Now, I remember Loki went off on the Eye of Judgment not too long ago on this program,

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.440
but Loki, what are your thoughts on the Eye of Judgment?

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:48.440
Does the PlayStation 3 need this, or does it need to just vaporize like it seems to

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:49.440
have?

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.920
I donít know if itís vaporizing, but some other things that they were talking about

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:59.080
releasing, like the GPS system for the PSP and the camera for the PSP, those are supposed

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:02.480
to be coming out fall of this year.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.480
Where are they?

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.480
Oh!

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.480
They didnít come out.

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:11.880
Well, I guess the GPS came out in Japan, but the more that you think about it, those peripherals

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:12.880
are just kind of lame.

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:17.680
And the only thing about the Eye of Judgment, I mean, I guess it could be cool if it was

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:21.960
just the eye toy and they were just kind of souping up the eye toy, that would be a little

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:26.400
bit better to recognize your face and stuff like that and to be able to tell different

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.720
things based on that.

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:32.720
That would be cool, but this whole giant setup where they had like, almost looked like some

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:38.160
sort of desk lamp stand with the camera pointing down at the paper, I mean, I canít see anyone

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:44.160
actually setting that up to play a card game, which the game on PlayStation 3 itself does

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.720
nothing other than kind of visualize, you know, card stuff.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:52.040
If it was like holographic or something, that would be pretty cool, but no, itís not.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:56.400
So why would you pay for a $600 console to play this really crappy card game that you

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:01.360
have to set up this really elaborate set up to play, and to be honest, they also want

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:06.520
you to buy these cards too, which, you know, all anyone has to do is scan it into their

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:10.280
computer and then you can print it out on a piece of paper and play it the exact same

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:11.280
way.

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:14.640
So the whole idea is just utterly retarded.

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:19.080
Alright, what would you say was the best video game in all of 2006, Logie?

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:24.080
Thatís tough, because thereís a lot of games out there and, you know, Iíd say my favorite

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:31.080
game of 2006, the one Iíve been playing the most of, well, Iíd have to say, you know,

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:36.360
oddly enough, itís a tie between like Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and Liberty City

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.360
Stories.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:41.400
Even though Liberty City Stories came out last year, the multiplayer is fun on those.

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.440
Then Saints Row would have to be up there too, because Saints Row, I think right now

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:48.000
Saints Row was the most fun for me on the 360.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.440
So which one of those would you put on the list?

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.440
Saints Row.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.960
Saints Row.

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:53.960
And why?

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.680
Because you love gun games.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:01.680
I love sandbox games and theyíre just really fun and Crackdown I think is going to be really

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:07.160
fun next year, but, you know, I donít know, weíll see if Microsoft is able to capture

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.960
the same kind of feel as that.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.520
Really it doesnít matter next year anyways, because once Grand Theft Auto IV comes out,

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:17.040
thereís no trumping it unless they really fuck it up, which is possible because they

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:21.480
fucked up the multiplayer every single Grand Theft Auto PSP version thatís come out, yet

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:26.160
we still seem to play it and kind of just, you know, accept the really glitchiness of

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:30.720
the game and, I donít know, itíll be fun multiplayer I think.

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.960
Alright, and the worst game of 2006.

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:35.920
Oh man, the worst game of 2006.

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:39.120
You know, everyoneís singing Sonic the Hedgehog and I think theyíre saying that because itís

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:43.440
fresh in their mind, but actually Sonic isnít that bad of a game, I mean, just the controls

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:48.760
are a little bit crappy, but I wouldnít say itís the worst game of 2006, if anything

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:54.000
I would go with some of the Ubisoft titles for the Wii that are really awful like, you

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:02.800
know, Monster 4x4 World Circuit, but Iíd say overall the worst game of 2006, itís

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:09.040
gotta be Bomberman because Bomberman, it was just a boring game and it wasnít really fun

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:16.080
at all and, I donít know, itís just bad, but you know, if I were to, you know, peg

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.240
a company as the worst company of 2006, itíd be Ubisoft.

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:24.640
Alright, I mean, granted, I love Ghost Recon, it was fun to cheat in that game and thank

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:28.360
God that they put cheat codes in the game that you can still get achievement points

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:35.700
for, so props for them for that, but Iím sorry, you know, all their Wii launch titles,

01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:38.440
with the exception of Rayman being average suck balls.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:44.680
Alright, well, thereís one box left, so I guess I get to open it, so here I go.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:53.000
Hey, look, I got the million dollars, whoo, alright, no, I got a best use of music in

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.960
a game and hands down Elite Beat Agents, hello, like, that was one of my favorite, definitely

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.400
my top three of the whole year was that game.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:05.000
That game is incredible and, you know, some people criticize it for the song list, but

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.280
I thought it was actually kind of fun and it made you appreciate maybe songs that you

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:13.520
had forgot about and the covers were, you know, well done and yes, even Ashley Simpsonís

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:15.400
song was actually kind of fun in the game.

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:18.640
The gameís got a great sense of humor, itís one of the most hilarious games Iíve played

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.640
and it keeps you coming back because itís got a lot of difficulty, you know, levels

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.880
in it and multiplayer.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:27.080
The game is incredible and horribly, horribly underrated, I think more people should be

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:31.600
checking out Elite Beat Agents, absolutely the best use of music in a game, in 2006.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:37.320
And then the news topic I have would be the horse armor expansion for Oblivion.

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.320
That was retarded.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.960
And this would be what, the topic or the horse armor?

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.960
No, the horse armor.

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:45.720
Because at Oblivion, when I think of games that have great add-ons, Oblivion is like

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.720
at the top of the list.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:50.320
You know, this horse armor was one little bump in the road of otherwise what was an

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:53.200
awesome expandable game was Oblivion.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.440
Probably the best expansions of the year was Oblivion.

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:59.400
But this horse armor, man, when it first came out a lot of people were like 250 points for

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.420
some frigginí horse armor, what the F?

01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.720
You know, and I kind of agree.

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:07.560
And this just goes along in general with some of these downloads that companies have put

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.560
up this year.

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:12.040
Itís gonna help us think about as well EAís pay to cheat system.

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.040
Thatís dumb.

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.040
Yeah.

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:17.680
Itís dumb especially when you have games, like I said, like Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter,

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:20.440
that the cheats are in there and you still get achievement points.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:24.920
I mean, grand, you canít use them online, but itís easy achievement points.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:25.920
I mean, thatís awesome.

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.840
Youíre an achievement point whore.

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:31.520
What kind of expansions would you like to see available on Marketplace in 2007?

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.880
Saints Row would be, you know, what theyíre doing with like Crackdown, for example, theyíre

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:38.880
gonna have actually portions of the city that theyíre gonna add later on.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:39.880
Thatís cool.

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:44.200
And theyíve built the game with that kind of expansions in mind.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:47.880
Saints Row would have been cool with some, you know, theyíre doing like maps and stuff.

01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:50.740
And actually theyíve had some pretty good stuff.

01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:54.960
Maybe more missions would be kind of cool or like a whole other section of the game.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:00.100
I definitely think in, as far as Xbox 360 goes, you know, they need more RPGs.

01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.600
They need their Blue Dragon this year.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.760
They need some of those other titles to come out.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.580
And I love side quests, man.

01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:09.000
Those downloadable side quests was an awesome idea for Oblivion and really, really adds

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.880
just hundreds and hundreds of hours to that game.

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.920
So itís great.

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.540
That is all 15 boxes.

01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:16.200
We made it all the way through.

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.200
Can you believe it?

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.200
Oh, my best and worst.

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:19.640
I gotta say mine because we gotta tally it up, huh?

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:20.640
You know what?

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:26.280
I wish Bethesda would make a game like Oblivion but set in modern day so I can have the guns

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.800
and be able to exert my, you know, power over the Woodlands.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.360
Do you think thereíll be an Elder Scrolls V though?

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.240
Of course thereís gonna be an Elder Scrolls V.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:36.960
I heard it here first.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.480
Of course thereís gonna be.

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.480
All right.

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.200
Well, my favorite game of the year, itís really close.

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:46.760
I really want to say Oblivion but, you know, and itís a great game, donít get me wrong.

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:50.000
It would definitely be my number two pick but I would say the best game of the year.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.820
It has to be Zelda, Twilight Princess.

01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:56.400
I mean, it really took everything that was about, even though the game was developed

01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:00.580
originally for the GameCube, yeah, whatever, it really does show what the Wii is capable

01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:04.860
of doing to what you always thought about the games that you played.

01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.860
You know what I mean?

01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:10.160
Itís a prime example of that and I think it really is kind of everything the Wii stands

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.240
for and itís absolutely the greatest game to have come out this year and well worth

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:14.240
the wait.

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:19.000
I mean, tons of playability and great puzzles and, you know, just fun.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.640
Itís a different playing experience, something you would never have had before, I think.

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:25.060
Itís something new.

01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:28.840
So thatís why it stands out in my mind as the best game of 2006.

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:29.840
Worst game of 2006?

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:30.840
Iím with Loki.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:31.840
Itís Bomberman X0.

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:32.840
Absolutely.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:36.400
I mean, how can you fuck up a franchise like Bomberman, okay?

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:41.820
Fucking up Sonic, I can see that but fucking up Bomberman, my God, I think Bomberman would

01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:46.400
have been so much better if they just had compacted it to 50 megs and made it an Xbox

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.400
Live title.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:50.820
The biggest problem with Bomberman is that it was a piece of shit game that they put

01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:52.400
out for $60.

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.400
I love you, Konami.

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:58.120
You did some great work this year but this game was somebody made a really bad decision

01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.120
toÖ

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:02.800
Iím thinking what happened is that there were some deadlines that had to be met so

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.720
this game got out and itís just so obvious and the final product is not even funny.

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:10.720
The problem with some of these companies though is they forget that, you know, theyíre screwing

01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:14.880
up like the simple stuff, the stuff thatís like essential, that would be the first thing

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:15.880
Iíd check.

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:21.720
Like, no save system, yeah, that might be important, you know, putting a save system.

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:27.060
Gee, I can do multiplayer on live but I canít do it in the same room when I could at E3.

01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:33.320
That is the biggest sign to me that something got really fucked up in the development process.

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:36.800
And the whole thing with Bomberman is like, ìOh, wow, that looks kind of cool, you know,

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:40.880
when they show the videos and stuff.î It would have been cool as like an action game,

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:44.640
maybe like MDK or something like that, you know, where like letís just kind of branch

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:48.680
the franchise a little bit off differently and then you could have, you know, the party

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.120
mode or the classic mode or something like that.

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:56.640
Youíre charging people $60 for what essentially is an Xbox Live arcade game, thatís the only

01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:01.720
good aspect of the game is playing it on live and because the gameís $60 and nobody has

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:05.360
it, so you canít even find people on live to play it with.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:08.520
They just made like some huge mistakes with that game, they just ruined it, absolutely

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:12.200
ruined it and made it the worst game of 2006.

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:16.240
So now weíve got to tally it up, letís look, letís see, weíre going to tally up the votes.

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:19.160
Letís start with the worst game of 2006.

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:25.640
It looks like, tallying it up, we had two votes for Totem Ball, two votes for Bomberman

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:31.340
but it looks like between Black Wolf, Extrofer and Dark Sakura, Sonic the Hedgehog with three

01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:33.680
votes is the worst game of 2006.

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:40.680
Sorry Sega, it wasnít that bad but you know what though, at least you get a second chance

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.960
with Sonic and the Secret Rings.

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:48.500
I agree they can redeem themselves but seriously, do a focus group or something with this game

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:50.060
next time.

01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:51.360
Anybody could have told you the controls were fucked.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.760
Well hereís the thing too, they made this game like Shadow the Hedgehog, Shadow the

01:30:54.760 --> 01:31:01.440
Hedgehog got shitty ass reviews so the problem is you can only make a Sonic game so fast

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:28.040
before it becomes uncontrollable.
