15453	19074	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20134	21877	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
21917	25522	This is episode number 211 for this December the 10th of 2006.
27004	29988	It's just myself, Rob Roberts, and the one and only Loki here tonight.
30229	36538	DarkSakura is away in L.A., I guess running around Disneyland or doing whatever girls do when they go to L.A.
37096	38017	And I'll see you next time.
56687	58968	MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
59268	60608	Give me more friends.
60708	61588	We want more friends.
61648	64249	And by the way, clips of like old shows are also on there.
64629	67870	And sometimes we post announcements as bulletins and fun things like that.
68350	70691	And we won't spam you too much on MySpace.
70731	71211	We promise.
71391	72131	We need to start.
72432	76833	We used to post little pictures when people would add us like a little game related things.
76873	78733	We'll probably get back into doing that pretty soon.
78813	81834	So maybe give people incentive to add us because we'll comment on you.
83195	84095	And it's my it's.
84730	87312	The only people that have a login for that are myself, Loki, and DarkSakura.
87332	89073	So you know if you get that, it's one of us doing it.
89113	90654	So add us on MySpace.
90694	91034	It's fun.
92115	92355	Yes.
92835	94696	Do that or we'll kill the ferret.
94996	96017	Anyway, let's get back into some news.
96778	108365	Anyways, so this one website, reghardware.co.uk is saying that Sony is going to ship a major PS3 firmware update in March.
109205	110246	And what will it contain?
111224	112665	We don't know.
113426	124993	But last, SC Europe VP of Technology, Paul Holman, cited by an Australian website, Smart House, said, new features and new gaming capabilities.
125033	126194	Well, that could be anything.
126914	127755	Goddamn people.
128135	139383	You know, actually, you know, it's only bad enough that we report on this because it's someone reporting on someone else reporting on something else saying there will be new things coming.
139563	139823	I mean,
142213	143534	Where is equally the blame?
143914	146115	I guess there's not too much to be surprised here.
146355	156839	What I think is interesting about this story is that if they do release a big firmware update in March, then it looks like they might be kind of mirroring a little bit what the 360 is doing with their biannual updates, right?
156859	158920	Because they have to do the fall update and the spring update.
158940	159961	At least that's what they promise.
160441	163002	And I believe they were doing that on the old school Xbox as well.
163062	165503	So this would kind of line up with that.
166884	167424	It makes sense.
167784	170205	One of the rumors, because one of the story rants,
171252	171592	The 1080i Fix
199261	209087	300 Big Macs or 3000 Bandages 60 Large Cheese Pizzas 250 Gallons of Gas 1988 Mazda 323 You could buy 15 shares of SonyCore You could take a skydiving course and do 4 jumps You could get a personal trainer and do 17 sessions at the gym You could buy 225 pounds of canned tuna
229208	240075	or, and it ends here on a nice on note, you could provide food, shelter, and clothing for two children for an entire year and have $150 left over for something nice for yourself.
241016	244398	What this doesn't address are the eBay profiteers, though.
244418	245419	They don't factor that in.
245879	254805	So I think they should have said, you know, all these eBay profiteers are stealing from the poor defenseless children who have no roof over their head, you bastards.
255045	255886	Think of the children.
256166	256386	I know.
256406	257747	Why isn't anyone thinking of the children?
259121	262424	But can you play Resistance on 225 pounds of tuna?
262544	263085	I think not.
264666	265907	At least that's what Sony would tell you.
266787	267288	Anywho.
267348	270170	You can't play Ridge Racer with 30 years worth of toothpaste.
273052	274033	Oh, anyways.
274994	279397	Well, definitely time for some wonderful street dates as always.
280038	287844	And like to start things off like we normally do with some exclusive street dates that you probably haven't heard from any place else.
288405	289886	So let's get going here.
290286	293629	Now there's a few stories that came out this week with games that are coming out.
294129	306358	One of those of course is D3's Simple 2000 series game for the 360 called Earth Defense Force X. And that's coming out on the 360 in the United States on March 21st.
306819	308580	And it's only going to be retailing for $39.99.
309080	309641	So not bad.
310061	312383	I'm glad they're actually bringing out some cool games like that.
313103	313904	One game that we...
315149	315589	Death Jam Icon
341753	342233	on the Wii.
342494	344315	Now that hasn't been said anywhere yet.
344595	345656	That'll be interesting.
345796	346737	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
347077	348638	Godfather on the Wii?
348758	350139	Godfather on the Wii.
350460	351160	The fuck?
352701	353442	That'll be fun.
354142	355323	I can't wait to play it.
356044	359827	I mean, you're going to get to bitch slap someone with a controller and it'll actually work?
360107	360487	I think so.
360527	361788	That might be kind of fun, actually.
362129	364090	They really do need Grand Theft Auto on the Wii, don't they?
364230	364891	Oh, I can't wait.
364971	369274	I want to be able to pull the hooker out of the car in the real motion and then bitch slap her.
369999	370359	Anyways.
371500	374221	Rainbow Six Vegas for the PlayStation 3.
375182	379163	One of those wonderful launch titles delayed to March 14th.
380144	381044	Co-PlayStation 3.
381825	386787	A little bit more difficult to develop for, apparently, than we thought.
387987	392169	Sonic the Hedgehog also delayed on the PlayStation 3 until January 17th.
392189	394750	Oh, are they going to make the game fun?
395951	396251	Probably not.
397084	403607	SSX Blur, which is going to be coming out on the Wii, also coming out in March, on March 14th.
404008	404928	And that will look pretty cool.
405028	405448	I can't wait.
405908	408390	They've cheapified it a little bit, and it looks pretty fun.
409210	412532	I like the cute little video I think you played on our pre-tape show last week.
412552	413172	It looked pretty cute.
413352	413592	Yeah.
414392	415013	Some other stuff.
415093	418775	Forza 2 has been delayed until May 16th of next year.
418975	420095	Yay.
420295	423597	There are some new DS games coming out, including Theme Park.
424062	428366	Pogo Island Stranglehold Sid Meier's Pirates on the PlayStation Portable February 26th
446946	448228	Charlie Brown All-Stars April 25th
463789	464169	Interesting.
464509	467210	But of course, you know, dates are subject to change, as they always are.
467530	487318	And one thing I wanted to ask you about, actually, this wasn't anywhere on the show roll, but something we put on orangelaunchradio.com earlier this week is that folks have been spotted on the internet playing DDR Universe on Xbox Live, which would indicate that the game has gone gold, I would believe, or else the achievements and things would not be loaded on Xbox's servers so that we could find them.
487738	489479	So, March still?
489499	490579	So March, yeah.
491139	491619	You sure?
491639	492920	Because the game's gone gold.
492960	494561	Don't you think this will make the January date?
494801	494901	No.
496121	496461	All right.
496802	498122	Still positive it's in March.
498342	498682	Why?
498943	499923	What makes you so damn sure?
499943	503264	Their January game is, or actually they don't have a game in January.
503284	504125	Well, then there you go.
504145	504845	Their February.
505866	506106	No.
506686	508647	They have, okay, they have games coming out in January.
508667	509507	They have Yu-Gi-Oh!
509527	510007	GX.
510988	512869	I want to say Tag Force is coming out.
513149	515770	And then, I don't think anything else.
515790	518111	Yeah, well, what if you go to work tomorrow and then, oop, the date got shifted.
518131	518691	They bumped it up.
519311	520532	They normally don't bump stuff up.
521058	522440	I'm thinking they're waiting until March.
522761	525885	March is the big dates for games.
526366	531954	It's the second push of the, or I guess the first push of the year other than November.
532475	536501	So, it's still going to stick to March.
537711	538231	You'll see.
538391	538932	You'll see.
538992	539572	You'll see.
539592	540112	We will.
540312	541252	We will.
543473	544034	We shall see.
544094	548055	And just because they're playing it online, hey, remember Pimps at Sea is online right now.
548075	553297	Does that mean he'll... But you couldn't go in and see the little graphics and all the achievements and everything.
553317	554878	Those weren't loaded on Xbox's servers.
554898	555878	You couldn't do anything with that.
555938	557479	It just showed that they were playing Pimps at Sea.
557779	560180	But with DDR Universe, that's how we were able to get all the achievements.
561221	562201	So it doesn't mean anything.
563281	563742	Oh, we'll see.
564702	565422	We will see.
565522	566163	We will see.
567003	567283	MF-er.
567816	569558	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
591045	618267	Hamsters, also coming out on the DS, so that should be fun Star Wars Lethal Alliance on the DS, now that sounds pretty good Superman Returns, the video game on PlayStation 2 Oh, oh, I played the demo of Superman Returns for Xbox 360 Sucked It was more fun to pick up a stranger and try to drop them in the ocean or leave them on the beach and then fly away I had more fun with the whole sandbox element of it than playing the actual game It's pretty bad
619331	621454	I'm not going to pick up the full game based off that demo.
621474	627662	I know you're not supposed to make a final judgment of a game based off a demo, but seriously, don't put it on Marketplace if you don't want people to do that.
627682	630165	I can't put my pre-order from based off the demo.
630386	631467	Yeah, I can't say I blame you.
631747	636714	Oh, also, The Sims 2 Pets coming out on the PSP, also from EA.
637507	640889	Far Cry Vengeance and Marvel Ultimate Alliance on the Wii on the 22nd.
641009	644872	Also, Star Trek Tactical Assault on the DS, also on the 22nd.
645332	646793	And also for the U.S.
647273	648594	Oh, sorry, did I cut you off?
648634	648894	My bad.
648994	650195	No, yeah, it's okay.
650935	653777	Anyways, so the U.S., we've got some pretty good releases this week.
654218	657620	Twilight Princess on the GameCube, you know, for those who may not have a Wii yet.
658060	658880	Definitely worth picking up.
658900	659261	Holdouts.
660281	660882	All your holdouts.
661282	664584	Star Trek Legacy, which actually I think that came out last week.
664924	666225	Some of this list is wrong.
666818	668839	Anyways, moving on.
668999	671981	I don't remember seeing Star Trek Legacy when I went to the store today.
672221	673462	I thought that was last week.
674062	676043	It's moved around so many times it's hard for me to remember.
676603	679185	Blazing Angels on PlayStation 3.
681386	684448	Full Metal Alchemist, Dual Sympathy on the DS.
685468	687609	Which I hear is supposed to be better than the PlayStation 2 ones.
688850	689390	Let's see here.
690291	691472	Elebits on the Wii.
691972	693093	I can't wait to pick that one up.
693133	694173	That one looks pretty awesome.
694193	695074	I want to get that too, yeah.
695554	695654	Um...
696417	697217	Let's see here.
698358	704321	Then I do believe on the PC we've got Rayman's Raving Rabbids finally making its way out there.
705282	707263	And let's see here.
707343	709064	Oh, there's actually a few other things on the Wii.
709344	717068	Metal Slug Anthology, Chicken Little Ace in Action, Rainbow Six Vegas is finally making its way on the PC.
717749	725193	And then on the PSP we've got Blitz Overtime, which is part of Blitz League.
725706	730893	and then, actually, I don't think there's any love for PlayStation 2.
731013	732615	Well, not too much, at least.
732675	737963	College Hoops 2K7, which was delayed from the original Xbox and 360 launch.
738543	741828	And then, yeah, that's a...
742279	743120	and many more.
769406	770967	Earth Defense Forces 3 Full Auto 2 Battle Lines
788316	791337	I believe that the US one came out last week.
791357	795098	Oh, so they're getting, I guess, that over in the Asian territories as well.
795478	799139	MotorStorm, also the Japanese version of MotorStorm, coming out December 14th.
799279	800739	Bastards, we have to wait until March.
800899	807100	Coming out on the Wii, Pokemon Battle Revolution and Rayman Raving Rabbids.
807500	812561	Also, a title based off of Bleach is coming out there as well on the Nintendo Wii.
813702	815362	Coming out on the PlayStation 2,
816192	818292	Beatmania 2DX, Happy Sky.
818312	820533	A lot of you music game fans have been waiting for that one.
820553	823173	That is finally coming out this week, December 14th.
823614	825274	So be on the lookout for that.
825394	828595	Lots and lots of PS2 titles, by the way, coming out this week in Japan.
829295	830455	Nobunaga no Yabu.
831515	834156	Actually, I think that's just going into Best Hits this week.
836436	840557	Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2, also going into the Best Hits.
841832	845634	and it looks like a lot of games are getting price reductions on the PS2 this week in Japan.
846474	847135	So check that out.
848295	850536	Well, as I mentioned earlier... Wait, one more.
850556	851036	Sorry, one more.
851137	854498	I want to say on the DS, three Rockman games coming out.
854838	858920	Ryusei, No Rockman, Dragon, Leo, and Pegasus all coming out December 14th.
859440	861281	Now what's the funniest game title for this week?
862001	862722	For the DS?
863482	864462	Just for anything.
867484	867744	I don't know.
867764	869245	There's not a lot of funny stuff this week.
869625	870045	Oh, here we go.
870814	874096	and stationary style set DS Lite, although that's not a game.
874137	875297	It's just a set.
875578	878019	It's like a little, you know, like accessory.
878760	879160	I don't know.
879200	879961	That's the best I could do.
880041	880261	Sorry.
880701	881022	Okay.
881402	881622	Anyway.
881642	882703	No Love Hamster this week.
882743	882963	Sorry.
883403	884024	Love Hamster.
885393	885793	Let's see.
885933	902098	Anyways, as I mentioned earlier, the PlayStation 3 just had a firmware update and was fixing some of the issues that they had with 720p being downscaled to 480p for those people that had older TVs that couldn't do the 720p and only did 1080i.
902939	911141	Well, apparently there's a firmware update now, the version 1.3, which actually made attempts to patching that.
911821	912482	It makes the 1080i
914344	927489	The default resolution now, and then the 720p is kind of secondary, so for the people that had, you know, the 1080i only HDTVs, you know, kind of fixed some of that.
927689	938353	However, though, there's still, if you want to watch a Blu-ray movie, the machine will still scale it back, I guess, to 480p, so you have to switch it manually.
938873	942755	It sounds like that they've sort of fixed the problem, but not quite fixed it all the way yet, so.
947151	956701	Why can't it be just simple like the 360 where if it's in 1080i, it stays in 1080i unless I pop in a DVD, which is only going to go to 480p anyways.
958563	961265	I don't know, why can't you just manually select your resolution?
961325	962987	That seems like it should make sense.
963468	964789	Stop trying to think for me.
966598	974084	Well, I know Sony's been taking a lot of heat lately, but slowly but surely we're starting to hear some pretty rad things coming out of Sony, and I think this is pretty awesome.
974764	981870	Even though there is no price or date set for this, the PlayStation Network is going to be getting Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.
981910	982790	I think that's pretty rad.
982850	988895	Yeah, that's according to Famitsu Weekly, and Bandai Namco is going to be releasing this for the download service.
989035	992898	Probably Japan will get this first, but at least gives us an idea of what's to come.
993237	994858	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1014949	1018931	If they were to go that far with it, shit, they could probably release it as a full game and make pretty good money.
1019371	1023213	So it'll be interesting to see how much they charge for this on the PlayStation Network.
1023573	1030177	Certainly could be one of the, you know, I think PlayStation's kind of been looking for its geometry wars.
1030537	1033358	And sure, you've got Blast Factor and Blow, or Blow.
1034579	1034959	Flow.
1036480	1039922	Flow seems to look pretty cool if you've played the little web application online.
1039942	1042323	I'm not going to live that one down.
1042605	1044626	But this could be, like, the, you know, must-have.
1044726	1047467	This, and, like, Gran Turismo HD also coming out in the network.
1047927	1050388	You know, they're going to have some pretty powerful stuff on their network soon.
1050448	1053809	So, Sony, and, you know, I guess they got Lemmings this week, too.
1054049	1056330	Yeah, Lemmings, too, and it was a remake.
1056390	1057990	It was completely redone.
1058631	1059411	Lemmings, too, is fun.
1059551	1059991	I liked it.
1060111	1064113	So, slowly but surely, is Sony making some waves in the online scene?
1064173	1067154	I must say, for once, I say good job, Sony.
1067994	1068074	Yep.
1068493	1074534	And actually, Enchanted Arms for the PlayStation 3 is going to be getting some enhancements as well.
1076375	1078755	It's kind of cool to see that it's not just a port.
1079375	1089917	What they're going to be adding, though, are going to be some graphical tweaks, of course, including new character animations, new chapters to the story, new golems will appear, and the battle system will be improved.
1090538	1091838	Will the voice acting be improved?
1092578	1093178	I don't know about that.
1093398	1097539	It says even the themes for the opening and ending will be recomposed by Mink.
1098683	1100444	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1129875	1130955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1153033	1159818	HD DVD has a 46% more positive discussions when it comes to websites than Blu-ray.
1160719	1165482	About half as many people are impressed with Blu-ray visuals than are with HD DVD visuals.
1165502	1168464	I guess these guys are scanning websites to see what people are saying.
1168705	1170846	Of course, they don't say what websites they're looking at, but whatever.
1171707	1179532	Now, what's interesting about this is that they say the key reasons for the low Blu-ray acceptance is the forced inclusion on the PlayStation 3 and PS4.
1180573	1183034	Sony's previous format reputation.
1183374	1190456	So this might be kind of alluding to the fact that PlayStation 3 might actually be being harmed by the fact that the Blu-ray is a forced thing on it.
1191276	1192737	Well, just like the UMDs.
1192897	1194377	UMDs didn't really take off either.
1194397	1195718	Yeah, I know.
1196178	1202860	Well, we all know why UMDs didn't work because they were charging more than they were for the DVDs and there wasn't as much on them and you couldn't watch them on a TV.
1203380	1205861	I mean, it was a stupid format from the beginning, really.
1207272	1211054	If they had charged half as much as the DVDs, I bet the format would have done a whole lot better.
1211635	1212435	A whole lot better.
1213576	1213936	I don't know.
1214836	1216177	Anyways.
1216197	1225362	I just want to say, by the way, what a report like this could do is it could make more of those movie studios want to put out HD DVDs, which in the end is going to really hurt Sony.
1226242	1226963	It is going to hurt them.
1227743	1232726	Because pretty soon it's not going to be... And that's the thing with Blu-ray and HD DVDs.
1234189	1242774	I don't think anyone's really jumping into it right now either because, okay, I buy a movie that's in, I buy an HD DVD player.
1242994	1246936	Well, now some of my movies are going to be on this format and some of them aren't.
1247376	1249097	So what, I have to buy two different players?
1249237	1250058	Fuck that shit.
1250078	1251339	I ain't going to buy that stuff.
1251979	1255341	Everyone's waiting until one format prevails and that's what they're going to buy.
1256581	1261484	Blackwolf, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf's in chat right now and he's bringing up an interesting point.
1262525	1289564	he says HD DVD has a reference DVD that really shows off the power of the format King Kong Blu-ray doesn't really have a comparable reference DVD he says Talladega Nights which you might be thinking not really a good choice because you know King Kong was more of a like action type movie and you know big special effects Talladega Nights you know maybe a few racing scenes here and there but otherwise not exactly a big you know explosions and
1290343	1292464	Manly Man Movie to show off the effects.
1292484	1298388	What they need to do is bring out the special edition of Final Fantasy Advent Children.
1298928	1300509	That shit would blow people away.
1301630	1303250	Might not be a bad title for Blu-ray.
1303270	1305732	That's the only thing I want Blu-ray for is that movie.
1305972	1308073	GS68 says they should have used Snakes on a Plane.
1310795	1314417	I don't think Snakes on a Plane should be used for reference for anything other than crappy movie.
1316218	1316518	Anyways.
1317572	1324817	So, the PlayStation 3, Sony is of course talking about improvements that they're possibly going to make to the system as well.
1325518	1334384	They're talking about introducing new third-party applications and hardware, you know, new controller schemes like the Eye of Judgment that's going to suck.
1334664	1337106	Shit, we haven't heard about that in a long time, have we?
1337606	1338907	Maybe they went back and made it better.
1339761	1341002	That was supposed to be a launch title.
1341042	1342302	Whatever fucking happened to that?
1342422	1342883	Oh, I know!
1342923	1346144	Because it sucks as a game console peripheral.
1346604	1349546	Because you have to have this giant elaborate setup to play a card game.
1349646	1350366	No, I don't think so.
1350406	1352027	That's not why I'm going to spend my $600.
1352787	1355108	But it's the Eye of Judgment.
1355429	1357470	At least that's how they were always introducing it.
1357510	1359450	The Eye of Judgment.
1360151	1365333	Yeah, they could have gone away with the Brown Eye of Judgment and take a dump on your console.
1366014	1366714	Anyways, um...
1367774	1370295	So it's kind of interesting, though, about the whole article.
1370435	1377659	And this one tech site, Smart House, saying that Sony will launch a PlayStation 4, but not any sooner than 2010.
1378359	1382982	Wait a second, I thought the PlayStation 3 is future-proof, and it's going to have a 10-year cycle.
1384882	1385963	Oopsies.
1386123	1388484	Anyways, so, duh.
1388764	1393787	They're going to be adding more content and more, you know, stuff like iTunes and...
1394995	1395876	Blah, blah, blah.
1395916	1399059	It's going to basically be the same thing as all the other consoles out there.
1399499	1405545	They're going to offer download services for video and for music and for games.
1407407	1410550	God, it's not a big surprise.
1410590	1414634	I mean, unless they said, you know, the PlayStation 4 is going to print money.
1414734	1417076	I mean, I don't know.
1418018	1423562	I'm surprised that Circuit City ad did not say that the DS prints money or something like that.
1423983	1430428	I keep thinking of that picture I've seen all throughout the internet where it says it prints money and has the happy Iwata and Miyamoto.
1430768	1431508	Anyway, I'm...
1433103	1439228	I'm thinking about, like, you know, PlayStation 4, and I kind of think about, in my mind, I know it's way too early to think about it, but, like, what could really be better?
1439448	1446974	I mean, like, graphically, I mean, graphically, these games are starting to look so realistic, it's hard to imagine what could be even better, but, you know, I guess you never know.
1446994	1448595	I mean, I guess I won't know it until I see it.
1449016	1453279	And, you know, I guess a lot of us probably thought the same thing, like, when the NES first came out, like,
1453826	1456128	Oh man, this is so much better than Atari 2600.
1456729	1458290	Games will never look better than this.
1458310	1469240	Listen, okay, the PlayStation 4 is going to be able to put out games at fucking 240 frames per second, and it's going to be in full 2160p.
1469461	1472083	Yes, but will it have the Eye of Judgment?
1473504	1474525	Of course it will.
1475326	1477668	And you know what the Eye of Judgment is going to be used for now?
1478669	1479490	Plane checkers.
1481161	1484045	Checkers have never been so EXTREME
1493484	1494065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1514506	1526962	And can you really imagine yourself, I bought this system and I bought these special cards, which by the way could probably be photocopied and used in the game instead of buying these special decks.
1527571	1528691	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1550456	1553318	Like, I wanted to raise my hand and go, why would you buy this?
1553498	1555699	I mean, really, this is stupid.
1556299	1557540	It's a tech demo right now.
1557600	1558901	Great, leave it as a tech demo.
1558941	1560221	Then you see it as a launch game.
1560782	1561802	No, it's stupid.
1563283	1566445	Just stop wasting the time on this and produce some better games.
1568626	1570087	I like the brown eye of judgment.
1570127	1571507	That's something they should do.
1572848	1574069	I'm seriously, I mean...
1575461	1576441	The Brown Eye of Judgment
1608104	1608584	I don't know.
1609045	1618271	I can't just imagine with a brown eye of judgment when you're doing so horrible in a game, the console shits itself.
1622834	1624635	Wait, you know they have Rumble... My Sony.
1625115	1625856	My Sony.
1626696	1628978	Wherever I go, he goes...
1630598	1632140	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1643223	1645284	This is how ridiculous this peripheral is.
1645544	1652667	I mean, I really wish our listeners could have been there at E3 when they're demonstrating this thing, because it was the most ridiculous peripheral.
1652967	1657909	It was like, didn't somebody in the room, like it was you or somebody, ask like, what the hell's the point of this thing?
1658149	1661230	Like, I swear to God, someone asked the question like, what are you going to do with this?
1661650	1663190	I mean, is this it?
1663371	1666572	I swear you asked like, is this it?
1667532	1668993	Could I just copy the cards?
1669553	1670933	I mean, seriously, what is it?
1671093	1672394	And they raced us out of there.
1673597	1677261	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1695769	1697550	and Stupid Parents.
1698191	1698771	This is interesting.
1699212	1711601	A South Carolina woman recently called the cops on her 12-year-old son and had him arrested, charged with petty larceny for stealing a Christmas present from under the tree.
1712001	1713242	What does this have to do with games?
1713563	1715004	Well, it was a Game Boy Advance.
1716245	1720548	Now, supposedly, this actually follows a string of crimes committed by the kid.
1720628	1724431	Shoplifting, stealing from mom's wallet, and, oh, punching a cop.
1726776	1731157	Well, I'm glad that they got him in before it was too late, you know.
1732117	1733758	Next thing you know, he's going to murder someone.
1733778	1735358	Stealing from Santa Claus.
1735458	1736058	No, no, no.
1736098	1736858	That's a big no-no.
1737098	1738879	You know what they should do when they take him into court?
1739339	1741199	They should say, so you're into games, huh?
1741600	1747041	Well, we're going to, instead of having a normal judge, we're going to bring in the brown eye of judgment.
1747981	1751182	And then it will decide if it's going to shit on the kid or not.
1751582	1752002	That'd be great.
1752022	1753222	You know what?
1753282	1754363	No, it's kind of interesting.
1754403	1756183	I'm surprised they haven't sued Nintendo.
1756776	1761320	The Desire for the Console made him punch a cop
1779898	1781019	They were, like, using their authority.
1781039	1781700	I'm not surprised.
1781720	1782941	Respect my authority!
1783181	1784282	And then give me a PlayStation 3.
1784322	1786104	Yeah, they did that with the 360, too.
1786164	1787805	A security guard did the same thing with the 360.
1787965	1789066	It's kind of messed up.
1789587	1789807	Yeah.
1790307	1790888	Gotta have it.
1792229	1792589	Anyways.
1792669	1793951	That's why the kid punched the cop.
1794831	1795232	Definitely.
1795252	1798254	Cyborg99 in our chat says, Who buys a Game Boy Advance anymore?
1798314	1799335	Get a DS instead.
1800276	1800496	True.
1800917	1802138	No one buys a Game Boy Advance.
1803079	1804320	Haven't sold one in ages.
1805077	1817706	Anywho, so now there's a brand new campaign that's being launched by GameStop, among other people, to kind of educate parents on the ESRB rating system.
1817766	1819047	Don't copy that floppy!
1820428	1821529	Oh, sorry, the ratings.
1821869	1823550	Rating systems, not copying games.
1823991	1834178	Anyways, so they've launched a brand new website called respecttheratings.com, and it's basically talking about what the ratings mean,
1834879	1839062	and how you can enforce them better with your kids.
1839122	1842264	Basically talking about the different genres of games and stuff.
1843284	1855592	Also having a bit, they have some actual terminology on here which is great because they actually define Frag defeating an opponent in a first or third person shooter game.
1857393	1859975	Like, you know, giblets.
1860195	1863057	Tiny pieces of what's left of the character one.
1863442	1864983	When they meet an unfortunate end.
1865183	1868584	Giblets sounds like something your brown eye of judgment leaves on the counter.
1868644	1869085	Giblets.
1872026	1874547	It's just like, you know, just talking about different things.
1874907	1875648	It's interesting.
1877669	1888734	I guess a good tool for parents, but to be honest, I mean, no matter how many websites like this and how many posters and how many people across the counter tell you,
1889327	1890668	I had no idea what the M meant!
1890689	1891770	I thought it meant it was mm-mm good!
1891790	1892250	M for mom.
1892270	1892710	With the tattoo.
1892750	1892831	Sigh.
1918859	1926188	Jimmy Kimmel had him and his mom on the show last week and gave the kid the entire Oz DVD collection as a reminder of what happens in jail.
1927630	1930473	Do not parade this child on your talk show!
1931394	1932836	He's supposed to be punished!
1933577	1934999	Dude, he punched a cop!
1936332	1937113	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1962771	1964251	And Activision also is hoping folks respect the ratings.
1964271	1965732	They're actually surveying parents on the ESRB.
1987179	1987519	and DarkSakura.com.
2016471	2019533	They did this over a week from Harrison Group, who I've heard of before.
2019573	2023275	They're a pretty respectable surveying group.
2023955	2024756	So, interesting.
2025456	2025916	Well, great.
2027037	2028758	Well, there were some interesting guides.
2028838	2045307	I know one of them was posted on Engadget this week, talking about what you need, because definitely one of the big gifts this holiday season is HDTVs, especially with game systems out there, a lot of them requiring high def for better graphics and stuff.
2045990	2047651	You're going to need an HDTV at some point.
2047951	2048972	It's time to get with the times.
2049392	2051733	So, there's a wonderful little guide.
2052013	2058237	Actually, this was done by A&E Interactive, part of Mercury News.
2058277	2064820	They've got a guide to what gamers need to know when buying an HDTV.
2064860	2075526	They go through everything from the basics, including what the different things mean, including 480p, what the progressive versus interlaced means.
2077233	2082037	Very interesting stuff, including comparisons between flat panel or rear projection, etc.
2082778	2098791	And personally, the other thing, I don't know if it was mentioned on here, but another thing you might want to check also when looking into a TV is websites like IGN, for example, were running lists of HD TVs and possible lag on these TVs.
2098911	2101013	So you want to check into lag, definitely.
2101433	2104335	Also, price-wise, you want to make sure that your TV...
2105609	2108211	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2129005	2134668	because most of these guys are what, like college kids that are trying to pool together the money they've got to buy a good TV?
2134748	2136048	So they're just going to buy something cheap.
2137809	2143492	If I were our listeners, what I would do is – and this is how I bought my TV.
2144352	2148194	Shopping around, I actually found Newegg.com was pretty cheap.
2148254	2151896	They had a lot of refurbished TVs, and you can buy a refurbished TV.
2152316	2155238	Maybe it's last year's model or earlier this year or whatever.
2156565	2158647	But it's still pretty good for the price.
2158707	2160488	And I got like a 37-inch TV.
2160508	2163071	It does upwards to 1080.
2163111	2166193	It actually has built-in VGA, DVI, etc.
2167554	2168055	for about $800.
2168255	2170257	And it wasn't that bad.
2170357	2171758	And they're only going to come down in price.
2171798	2176622	And probably if you shop right after Christmas, I think you're going to get a lot of deals that way too.
2177003	2177963	Here's how I got mine.
2178003	2181186	About a year ago, I bought an HDTV at Costco for about $600.
2182851	2184291	And that was a 30-inch widescreen.
2184311	2187912	Now, it was a CRT, so I had a big back, and some things were a little bit blurry on it.
2188332	2189053	But here's the thing.
2189133	2193574	That thing broke after like a year, but since I bought it from Costco, they'll take it back.
2193914	2195534	So I took it because I still had the receipt.
2195594	2196394	I held on to that, baby.
2196694	2198335	So I took it back to Costco.
2198375	2205597	They took it back, and for about $100 more, I got an upgrade to a flat 32-inch widescreen TV that's pretty awesome.
2205617	2207237	It's Costco's in-house brand, but you know what?
2207277	2208557	It works great for what I need.
2209258	2210518	And the one I bought, you know, it's...
2211513	2212034	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2232998	2233558	www.DarkSakura.com
2259082	2280344	but that's about it so just really do your research and score pretty good HDTV or if you're really cheap just fucking buy the VGA cables for whatever system you want to play it on and just play it on your TV or your computer monitor that's why I did my 360 before I had an HDTV and it works just good so interesting
2281158	2285221	All right, well, we're going to get into the mailbag, but first we're going to go to our voicemail of the week.
2285301	2292286	And if you want to leave us a voicemail, you can always go to... Give us a call after show hours to 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2292326	2293607	That's a toll-free number in the U.S.
2293667	2294128	and Canada.
2294828	2295249	Get this.
2295349	2298851	Here is our voicemail of the week that somebody left.
2300673	2301814	I love you guys!
2303315	2303695	That's it.
2305556	2307658	Well, we love you too, but next time leave your name.
2308258	2308338	Uh...
2309369	2319012	Needless to say, we have not been getting many voicemails of the week, so we are encouraging you guys to leave your thoughts on the program in audio format by giving us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2319092	2321632	Thanks to the anonymous listener who was spreading the love there, though.
2321652	2322252	We appreciate it.
2322352	2323273	It inflates our egos.
2323793	2324253	We like that.
2324793	2326534	Let's get into our mailbag, boys and girls.
2326614	2328634	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2335920	2336521	DarkSakura.com
2352435	2353796	And I forgot to email you guys about it.
2353936	2359199	It was during the Wii launch and some people were playing Risk at the front of the waiting line, just like the old gamers back in the day do.
2359660	2366844	And I was just wondering what board tabletop games would you like to see in the Xbox 360 Marketplace Wii Connect PlayStation 3 online service?
2367245	2368946	I personally would like to see a couple things.
2369046	2370046	First being Risk.
2370367	2373749	I would love to be able to say to the other people, I have Australia, bitches!
2374149	2375690	Or eat that, Kamstaka!
2376551	2377751	Another one would be Monopoly.
2377811	2381894	Just seeing people's faces when they land on Park Place with a hotel and if they'd have to pay up.
2382554	2384395	The last one would be Candyland.
2384555	2387438	Don't know why, but I bet it would be Microsoft's new Gears of War or Halo 3.
2388118	2388598	Definitely.
2389279	2391661	Keep up the good work and reject false icons.
2391861	2392621	Thank you, Yuri Lover.
2393062	2396804	So, what board games would you like to see on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox Live?
2396824	2397225	What do you think?
2397605	2398646	I second Monopoly.
2398986	2401828	That might be fun, especially with the Xbox Live Vision camera.
2402949	2405210	Because then you can dress up like Mr. Moneybags.
2405731	2407252	I'm trying to think.
2408024	2411587	Well, you know you're getting like Settlers of Catan in some of the British games, which is kind of cool.
2411607	2414589	They're also doing Checkers and Chess, I think, at some point, too.
2414730	2416831	I remember that was with the vision camera.
2418092	2419694	Battleship might be pretty fun.
2421375	2425838	You know, actually, it'd be kind of cool to see some other, like... I have one.
2425899	2426319	I have one.
2426699	2427180	Clue.
2428200	2428901	Clue would be fun.
2429061	2430262	Clue would be awesome.
2430282	2431603	And I don't want regular Clue.
2431643	2433745	I want Clue Master Detective.
2434824	2446487	or how about if you could like patch your, like they could, see, you know what Xbox could do is that they could charge you then like, you know, 80 points to download, you know, the Simpsons Clue and, you know, what other Clue games they've done.
2446507	2452148	Like all the licensed version of Clue that they have and, you know, Cameo Clue and Project Gotham Racing Clue.
2453669	2455249	I think it was the Ford.
2456069	2460030	It was the Ford in the Indy Raceway with the carbon monoxide.
2461231	2462231	Okay, maybe that's kind of lame.
2462251	2462511	I don't know.
2463311	2463911	DDR Dollar Bill
2487113	2488294	of going to various tournaments.
2488514	2491275	There's a few videos of me floating around, some good, some not so good.
2491695	2495016	Seems that if it was good, it was good, and if it was bad, it was, well, let's not go there.
2495396	2499057	Before I get into it, I do wonder if I'm one of the older listeners out there at age 31.
2499217	2510802	I know for a fact we do have some listeners above the age of 31, and in fact, you know, our own DarkSakura is 30, and I'm 28, so not too far away, and Loki, you're what, 26?
2512122	2514963	26, so we're not that far away.
2516453	2520315	Bill goes on to say, I just wanted to say that the entire cast does a great job in every broadcast.
2520355	2529882	I started listening to the podcast mainly once after I got a working iPod after going through about four of them in a creative zen that went emo and killed itself after playing the theme song for Evangelion.
2530482	2534185	I always look forward to each podcast, so I do enjoy your live show more.
2534225	2537367	There's times I can't make Sunday nights due to other things going on.
2537888	2540609	What I do enjoy about each show is the fresh insight into gaming.
2540649	2544232	Not the standard garbage that some game magazines, websites tend to publish, but rather
2544577	2544897	DarkSakura.com
2570427	2574770	Being only able to get the most half of my money back is not a good way to keep a living.
2575411	2579454	I best end this letter before the chat room explodes with people saying to shut the fuck up and so forth.
2579514	2581115	In conclusion, great show, guys.
2581195	2583877	Keep up the work and see you on the chat rooms whenever I can.
2584237	2585098	That was a very nice email.
2585398	2585698	Thank you.
2586279	2587460	I thought there was a question in it.
2587500	2591543	Well, I thought there was a question here somewhere, but I guess the older listeners part was the question.
2591923	2592503	But that's all right.
2592583	2598788	We appreciate a nice fuzzy email once in a while that makes us feel good about what we do and not getting paid for it.
2598828	2599369	We appreciate it.
2599409	2599969	You guys are awesome.
2600812	2602253	Next email comes to us from Ricky
2629298	2629878	Thanks for watching!
2651129	2655653	are the people that talk with the Best Buy rep as they are persuaded to buy a wallet-melting television.
2656114	2665943	In the future, do you think that there will be a particular method of getting the word out about HD resolutions in the mainstream media, making the info about HD available to everyone so they can upgrade too?
2666123	2666643	Your thoughts?
2667664	2675071	I'm sure they're going to have, you know, well, they already have kind of, not really public service stuff, but like they have info, you know,
2675635	2676276	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2700791	2704474	I think especially next Christmas, HDTVs are going to be a big, big deal.
2704494	2708738	I mean, they already are a little bit this Christmas, but next Christmas especially, I think they're going to be even more affordable.
2709058	2714723	But I don't think you're going to see a lot of, you know, the brochures and things you're going to see are going to be a best buy.
2714823	2716905	Circuit City, the place that's selling the TVs.
2717045	2720748	I don't exactly see there being a big, you know, public knowledge campaign.
2721209	2726774	In the end, people are going to look at what's up on the wall and what's showing on the screen and they're going to go, which one's pretty?
2727964	2732085	So it's tough for a gamer because they don't show a lot of video games on those things.
2732605	2737946	So it's hard to choose when you're a gamer what type of TV would look best for your games.
2738307	2740987	You kind of have to base it off whatever in-store feed they have running.
2742127	2745028	So it makes the choice a little more difficult.
2745508	2746128	We'll see, though.
2746148	2747029	We could be proven wrong.
2747069	2747389	Who knows?
2747609	2748249	Who knows what they'll do?
2749089	2752130	All right, let's go to the next email, which comes to us from Nim.
2752390	2752610	Nim.
2753663	2754644	Hey guys, how's it going?
2754664	2759806	I haven't been able to listen to your show for a couple weeks, seeing as I finally got my hands on Beatmania 2DX and a new girlfriend.
2760087	2761167	Hey, keep your hands off her!
2761908	2763028	She may not appreciate that.
2763128	2763548	No, I'm kidding.
2764329	2765169	If you ask, it's okay.
2765790	2766690	But that's besides the point.
2767010	2770232	Okay, I feel like touching on a few subjects at hand since I've listened to your last podcast.
2770572	2782679	First of all, I'm not sure I quote-unquote hate Sony, but I don't think I'm going to even get a PS3 until they start releasing some better games, or some I've heard rumors about, such as Final Fantasy VII, or they start releasing Beatmania 2DX on it.
2783168	2786249	The war with me is probably going to be with Microsoft and Nintendo here.
2786630	2790091	The games already released for the 360 look great and I want them badly.
2790471	2796354	It's sort of along the same lines with the Wii, but I'm going to be waiting to get that because I've been dying to play Brawl since I've heard about it.
2796834	2798295	What are some of the rumors you've heard about it?
2798635	2801236	I've heard there were supposedly over 100 characters supposed to be in it.
2801776	2802957	I highly doubt that, sorry.
2803697	2806639	Thanks guys, I'll be tuning in hopefully tonight or I'll get your podcast tomorrow.
2807599	2808400	That comes from Nim.
2810100	2810900	You know what's interesting, though?
2810920	2814502	You say that the real war is between Microsoft and Nintendo, but I actually disagree.
2814902	2822245	Because if Microsoft and Nintendo can pull enough of the share away from Sony, then they could both effectively claim victory in here.
2822565	2834069	Let's face it, they were not number one the last time around, so either one of them comes up on top, or even goes from number two to number, you know, or from number three, let's say Nintendo goes from number three to number two, you know, they're
2836181	2840442	And some speculate Nintendo's going to go from number three all the way to number one this time.
2840823	2842263	You know, again, speculation.
2842503	2843544	I'm an analyst, okay?
2844304	2852488	And Xbox 360 is going to stay at number two, but it's going to be a bigger number two than it was the last... Sorry, I'm still thinking about the brown-eyed judgment.
2852868	2855949	It's going to be a bigger number two than it was the last time around for them.
2856209	2860771	So if they can take, you know, more of Sony's share, then they both can effectively win.
2861351	2861852	You know what I mean?
2862212	2862372	Mm-hmm.
2862712	2862812	So...
2863590	2864931	Any thoughts from you, Loki, on this?
2865652	2874159	Well, of course, Microsoft say both them and Nintendo take the large share away from Sony.
2874659	2880024	I'm sure they're not going to settle for number two, so there will be a clear winner, I think.
2881365	2881705	I don't know.
2882726	2886489	I think the 360 is doing pretty good so far, where they have something for everybody.
2886949	2889812	Although the only casual games I've seen so far, mainly...
2892523	2899428	Just on Xbox Live Arcade and even... Well, I guess Viva Pinata would be a casual game, but it sucks.
2899788	2901829	I mean... I didn't think it was that bad.
2902170	2902770	It's just different.
2903288	2904429	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2931923	2933264	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2955562	2955682	Nick S
2984574	2985615	Nick S sent us an email.
2985975	2986315	Hello.
2986415	2988577	First, I would like to compliment you on your podcast.
2988617	2990018	I've been listening for a few months and love it.
2990198	2990498	Thank you.
2990598	2990999	Appreciate it.
2991519	2995322	I was wondering what you thought about Gears of War because I would like to get OLR's opinions.
2995962	2996322	P.S.
2996442	2999345	Every time I'm holding my PSP, I'm always listening to you, OLR.
2999405	3000846	You're all the best gamers I know.
3000986	3001646	That's very sweet.
3001686	3001986	Thank you.
3003067	3003768	Gears of War.
3004088	3008731	You know, I thought I talked about this on the show a little bit previously, but I'll say it again.
3009832	3013995	It's a pretty game, and it's a kick-ass co-op game.
3014645	3015608	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3022403	3023063	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3046566	3055288	usually been a little lower on what I like, but I didn't enjoy Gears of War as much as even freaking Prey I thought was more fun to play for me.
3056408	3060109	But maybe that's because Gears of War isn't quite the same traditional shooter either.
3060589	3064090	It's cover, shoot, cover, shoot, and a lot of the game has to do with covering.
3064510	3068451	And maybe I'm just more into the kamikaze type of playing.
3068491	3069612	Leroy Jenkins!
3069672	3071012	I'm that guy, you know?
3072254	3093660	well I wasn't really into the game either but then again I haven't really played it enough to give a fair shake yet but my co-worker just finally got a 360 and he bought actually Gears of War as well and he said that he hasn't been able to pass the first tutorial stage he says it's fucking hard and he's playing on the simplest difficulty and he plays a lot of first person shooters
3094634	3095775	It's not easy.
3095895	3097816	That even held me up for a little bit, too.
3097856	3101798	I finally got out of the stupid tutorial level, but I... You know, the first... It's just... I don't know.
3102558	3105540	Of course, I haven't... Now, admittedly, I have not played enough of the co-op.
3105640	3110582	I think that's my biggest problem, because that's where most people seem to be loving Gears of War, is co-op.
3110822	3111743	And, you know, I'll give it that.
3112543	3114164	I'll trust my friends' assessments on that.
3114864	3118046	And hopefully I'll get some friends someday and I can play Gears of War co-op.
3118546	3119107	That'll be fun.
3119727	3121768	If I can tear myself away from burnout this week, we'll see.
3122358	3123359	That's it for the mailbag.
3123399	3125400	If you want to send some emails, we'd love to hear from you.
3125500	3136048	And sorry, we weren't able to read every email we got this week on the air, but DarkSakura does make an effort to always read all the email, and when she's out, I'll step in and try to read and respond to the email.
3136088	3140191	We love to hear from you guys, and it really keeps us going here at Orange Lawns Radio, so we appreciate it.
3140211	3140691	Thanks, you guys.
3141192	3141692	Back to the news.
3142452	3154163	Anyway, so, I swear to God, I've had so many co-workers come up to me and go, Hey, have you heard about those crazy Wii straps breaking?
3154543	3157265	And people breaking their TVs with the Wii mode?
3157626	3164392	I mean, it's like ridiculous how much this has been spun out of proportion.
3164412	3164732	It's just...
3167037	3174640	It's idiots basically throwing the Wiimote at 90 miles an hour and going, Why did it break and smash my TV?
3174940	3179902	Maybe because you're trying to throw a real 90 mile an hour fastball in baseball when you really don't have to.
3179962	3183383	And it says in the manual, make the movement slightly.
3183463	3185124	You don't have to do it really hard.
3185744	3188986	Anyways, that being said, Nintendo has...
3190752	3193094	Actually gone ahead and fixed the straps.
3193594	3194855	They're a lot thicker now.
3195735	3201279	And you can actually find them starting with the Australia launch in the Wii Play bundle.
3201939	3204561	They have new straps.
3204961	3209885	And if you really want to, if you've broken your straps, you can probably buy them on the Nintendo store.
3210725	3213227	So yeah, the new remotes are going to have new straps.
3213707	3217710	All it is is kind of just a knot tied around the controller.
3217730	3218911	Couldn't you just get your own little...
3219847	3220167	and DarkSakura.
3239557	3267954	personally just don't do that crap at your own risk though exactly or don't throw the damn remote I mean seriously if you're gonna don't let go of it you're not supposed to let go of it they've got you know covers in case you know your hands get sweaty like my hands have never gotten that sweaty I mean and shit I right before I'm playing the Wii or something I'm eating you know fucking fast food my hands are all greasy from french fries so if that shit doesn't make the you know the Wiimote fly out of my hands then nothing will so
3268980	3276724	If you're really that clumsy and are prone to throwing shit through windows and TVs, then maybe you shouldn't, I don't know, buy a Wii.
3277264	3280846	Or maybe you should duct tape that shit to your arm.
3280906	3281286	I don't know.
3282087	3287870	JeremyTal1 in our chatroom says, A friend bought four new straps on Nintendo's website for $6.24 including shipping.
3288910	3291912	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to leave your own comments.
3291932	3296174	If you're listening live here on Sunday night, which we tape live 6pm at OrangeLaunchRadio.com every week.
3298171	3300912	By the way, component cables in stock.
3300932	3307354	Yeah, I just ordered from Nintendo as well, and I haven't checked the tracking of them, but last I checked they were in Portland, so I should be getting them next week.
3307714	3308234	Very excited.
3308614	3309475	Mine coming Monday.
3309555	3310055	Very excited.
3310075	3311195	Then I'm going to play more Zelda.
3311215	3314576	I've kind of held off from Zelda because I won't play it until it's as pretty as it's going to get.
3315016	3315837	I'm stupid like that.
3315877	3316337	Don't listen to me.
3317217	3323279	Blackwolf comments, Nintendo investigating the wrist traps means that they admit there is a problem which will open themselves up to lawsuits.
3324837	3325457	I doubt it, though.
3325477	3327118	Nintendo said not to be rough with it.
3327519	3328579	They did send out an email.
3328679	3330341	Did you get the email from Nintendo this week?
3331201	3332682	I got an email from Nintendo.
3333723	3335464	Bloggers got it, too, and it was posted all over.
3336425	3338527	We hope you're enjoying the Wii, but be careful with it.
3338547	3339267	I didn't get the email.
3339287	3340548	But here, I mean, come on.
3341089	3341669	Really, though.
3342131	3343111	Thanks for watching!
3362237	3363457	You're the only one to blame.
3363517	3373500	Do not fucking try to sue Nintendo because you were dumb and decided, oh, I'm going to let go of the remote while I'm bullying and it went through your goddamn TV.
3374100	3381401	I mean, seriously, if you're that stupid, and I imagine there will be someone that sues, I didn't know it would fly out of my hand.
3381461	3384582	I thought this tiny piece of string would keep it from anything.
3384982	3387363	I thought I could swing it around like a goddamn lasso.
3388343	3388523	I mean...
3390026	3392191	People are so goddamn retarded.
3392351	3396700	Okay, devil's advocate, do the games encourage this behavior?
3397843	3397963	No.
3398618	3399218	I don't think they do.
3399539	3404382	Because they show you, even like, for example, Rayman's Raving Rabbids, when they're showing you how to play it.
3404482	3407504	They show you, you know, holding the remote.
3407644	3409625	They don't show you wildly swinging around.
3409665	3411966	They show you just kind of making small little movements.
3412327	3417970	The wrist strap is around the goddamn bunny's hand, so it is encouraging the proper use of this.
3418450	3422233	And nowhere does it say in the game to swing as fast as possible.
3422473	3424214	It says in the Wii Sports manual...
3424514	3429537	And I know no one reads the manual anymore, but it says it in there to, you know, swing lightly.
3430098	3433280	You know, you do not need to do... You do not need to swing it wildly.
3434541	3436522	I don't know what more they could possibly do.
3436622	3439804	I mean, and Wii Sports seems to be the one that's been the biggest culprit.
3439864	3442186	You know, baseball, because people are trying to throw fastball.
3442206	3444788	Well, because you don't exactly throw pitches in Zelda, you know.
3445288	3446929	And that's the other huge game right now.
3447550	3450792	So, it's basically that game, and it's just people...
3451514	3452615	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3471926	3473046	It's just stupid people.
3473566	3475247	Ruining it for everyone.
3475267	3483528	Speaking of stupid, you'd be awfully stupid to buy point cards from Toys R Us, at least the ones that have been marking up their 2,000 point cards to $24.99.
3483868	3486229	That's what they're charging on the internet as well.
3486309	3491210	Now, keep in mind, 2,000 Wii points you can buy on your Wii for $20.
3492610	3495171	So, you'd be kind of dumb to buy this from Toys R Us.
3495831	3501672	Now, Miklatov, he had to leave the show because he had a pretty bad headache, but I know he wanted to point out that they were at
3502096	3503537	Best Buy or Target, something earlier.
3503557	3504977	And they saw the same thing going on there.
3505017	3506698	So this isn't just Toys R Us.
3507018	3509280	It's just people have caught Toys R Us because it's online.
3509540	3512341	So a lot of folks are selling these things online for more money.
3514202	3516243	And you know what's actually kind of interesting, though?
3518024	3524387	I remember originally when we were adding the SKUs for the Wii stuff before launch.
3525040	3525940	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3545476	3546496	is nothing.
3546676	3556439	I mean, the price that Best Buy probably pays for this stuff is like $16, and they're making only $4 off of this thing.
3556879	3558579	Or it might even be even less than that.
3558619	3566281	I think it's really like $2 is what they're making off of this stuff, and even less on controllers and other stuff.
3566621	3573603	So the fact that they're charging more, you know, granted, yeah, that's not very good, but the average mom and pop that are buying these things...
3574235	3577257	They don't know how much they're supposed to cost and they're going to pay that price.
3577657	3581000	Do you think Costco would be selling these even cheaper?
3581020	3585963	Because Costco is notorious for selling things very, very little above cost.
3586083	3590146	Do you think you could possibly get a $19 card at Costco?
3590306	3591387	You might be able to.
3591707	3592547	I'm not sure though.
3592788	3597951	It depends because if their margins are that small, they might not sell it at a loss or that little.
3598471	3600773	I mean, they might just sell it at the normal price.
3601505	3606167	But I'm not surprised though that you're seeing people charging $24 for these things.
3606467	3615251	It's just the same reason why you see MadCatz charging $60 for fucking component cables when I can buy React's component cables for $19.99.
3616652	3619913	Or fuck, the official Nintendo ones for like $29.99.
3620934	3622615	So they're just preying off people who don't know any better?
3622635	3630338	Yeah, they're preying off people that are buying these stuff as a gift for their kids or for Christmas and they don't know how much it's supposed to cost.
3630943	3638342	and I guess their excuse would be it's a convenience for our customers because little Bobby does not have a credit card so we're
3639068	3643310	And to be honest, I think it's a rip-off to buy them at retail anyways because you're paying tax on $20.
3644051	3644891	So just buy it online.
3644911	3649353	Well, the weird thing is I could have sworn I saw the Wii in some places was charging tax.
3649393	3654716	Like I saw a screenshot where somebody was being charged tax on the points, but I'm not charged tax here.
3655056	3657578	It says there's a tax thing on there.
3657938	3663861	I'm not sure if it's for that per se, but there's a little tax thing on there where you could be charged tax.
3664401	3665742	It's like a little spot for it.
3666243	3666723	Popcorn Shrimp
3695083	3697005	Well, I'm still stealing a fry that comes with the shrimp.
3698367	3702951	Anyway, moving on while I chow down here.
3703532	3708097	So, speaking of Nintendo, not a huge surprise.
3709518	3712081	They were a little short on their UK Wii shipment.
3713222	3713883	Hold on, I'm sorry.
3715445	3717587	Pennsylvania is being charged the tax.
3718741	3726363	and BlackWolf says, I must have seen the video on Joystick because they have the tax in Pennsylvania and that's where I guess the Joystick video came from.
3726863	3730963	Possibly, it's one of like 50 game blogs I read, so probably that is where I saw the video.
3731303	3731824	Interesting though.
3733024	3744206	Anyways, so they apparently weren't able to ship all the units for the Wii for the launch, but they are shipping more each week.
3744605	3745105	and many more.
3769758	3777141	You know, which even, couldn't even hit the 200,000 unit mark and ended up being 197,000 units, so... Whatever.
3778322	3780423	But hopefully, you know, you know what, UK?
3780863	3782944	At least you're getting the system on time.
3782964	3786645	Because you sure as hell don't have the places... On time-ish.
3787226	3790067	On time-ish, but you're still not... I mean, it's...
3790734	3794196	A couple days is a lot better than, say, a couple months.
3794637	3796498	Well, Nintendo is trying to make nice a little bit.
3796538	3800961	They have screwed over Europe constantly in the past, but now Europe is viewing this as, hey, we're getting screwed again.
3801982	3804103	All our consoles are going to the targets in America.
3805064	3807406	You know I was at GameStop today.
3807426	3808026	I'll say who it was.
3808046	3808366	I don't care.
3808426	3812909	I was at GameStop today, and I heard the clerk tell somebody, we're not really getting the wheeze in a lot.
3813370	3814971	You'd have better luck over at Target.
3815191	3816732	I was like, wow, that's a pretty...
3817851	3819471	It's a good thing I'm not a secret shopper.
3848228	3851349	Well, I hope you folks in the UK are enjoying your system.
3851729	3858871	Nobody answered the call last week where we asked some of our British listeners to tape folks in line that were waiting for the Wii.
3859592	3861472	No, no, they went to other game blogs instead.
3861532	3865494	We all saw the Germany crowd and Kotaku and all that other stuff.
3865994	3866754	Nobody loves us.
3866874	3867294	That's fine.
3867334	3868695	We'll try not to be too butthurt over it.
3870507	3877449	Something that you should be aware of if you are in the CPL, that would be the Cyber Athlete Professional League.
3877910	3882211	They're going to be drug testing you at the start of gaming competitions next year.
3882251	3884352	I'm sorry, that doesn't necessarily mean at the start of every competition.
3884392	3886933	I just mean at next year they will be testing for this.
3888613	3895276	It's kind of interesting because they're going to be testing for drugs, but the comparison people are making is that, wow, it's like real sports.
3895736	3898197	Games are becoming closer and closer to being real sports.
3898717	3898917	No, no.
3899707	3902469	Can steroids enhance your game-playing abilities?
3903109	3905590	I suppose some drugs could make your reaction times better.
3905851	3908892	Let me get this very, very clear.
3910753	3914235	Video games are not a sport.
3915416	3919158	They will never, ever, ever be a sport.
3919799	3924801	This is including anything with the Wii, because granted, you're moving around.
3925722	3927163	Okay, the closest thing you may...
3928129	3930391	Come to a sport, I guess, is Dance Dance Revolution.
3930511	3932813	But that's even still not even close.
3934174	3935736	Games are not a sport.
3936677	3937558	Football is a sport.
3937598	3939119	Actdeft says not even Wii Sports.
3939399	3940380	Not even Wii Sports.
3940560	3940840	Okay.
3942222	3943383	Football is a sport.
3944103	3945344	Basketball is a sport.
3946045	3946445	You know.
3948247	3950189	DarkTetsuya says DDR is a sport.
3950829	3951250	Not really.
3952151	3952651	In some ways.
3953092	3956174	In some foreign country out there... Oh, that's right.
3956334	3958135	Was it Switzerland or something made it as foreign?
3958155	3958615	Finland or something?
3958655	3959276	I don't know.
3959496	3961037	Sorry, pardon our ignorance, folks.
3961137	3962077	We don't remember who it was.
3963058	3965920	That's kind of a funny story, though, that they're testing for drugs and stuff.
3967781	3976686	There is another article that missed our cut here talking about soda highs in gamers.
3977046	3981589	Apparently, caffeine is the gaming drug of choice.
3982359	3984320	And they're talking about description.
3985661	3987442	Caffeine absorption is complete.
3987482	3988703	Your pupils dilate.
3988723	3990004	Your blood pressure rises.
3990584	3996167	And as a response, your liver dumps more sugar into your bloodstream.
3996547	3997148	That's funny.
3998408	4000450	Caffeine is, well, I mean, caffeine is a drug.
4000470	4002231	Well, they can't really be testing for caffeine.
4002251	4003331	You know, it's a legal drug.
4003371	4007053	If I want to drink a jumbo-sized coffee before I go play games, it's my right.
4008874	4009555	It's a legal drug.
4009595	4010415	I'm not doing anything wrong.
4010435	4011076	True.
4011116	4011336	True.
4012657	4012997	I don't know.
4015980	4020664	I'd love to see them taking steroids so that they throw the remotes through TVs and stuff.
4021044	4021685	That'd be hilarious.
4021745	4022425	I somehow doubt that.
4023026	4027810	Anyways, so there was actually some pretty cool stuff.
4027830	4036097	There was some sort of charity event where they were giving away a custom Guitar Hero controller that was made out of a real guitar.
4037134	4044319	and well, if you're interested in doing that, Kotaku linked to a story which basically has a how-to on how you can do that.
4044339	4047982	And I know this was also run on Hackaday and stuff like that.
4048002	4050604	The story actually comes from Toolmonger.
4051624	4062692	So if you want to check it out, it's toolmonger.com and it's how to build your own custom full-size wireless Guitar Hero controller and basically requires you to
4065307	4069391	Basically take apart a Guitar Hero controller and an actual guitar.
4070992	4073754	Pretty cool that he can make some pretty sweet looking guitars out from that.
4075615	4076196	Thanks for watching!
4097379	4124297	You know what though, but at least, argue if you will, which is the better game, Guitar Freaks or Guitar Hero I don't really care, but at least Guitar Freaks has slightly more games available At least there's what, like, you have Guitar Freaks V, you only have four games for it There's Guitar Freaks 3 and 4, Guitar Freaks V And the fact that Guitar Freaks had an arcade machine that most people played on before they played the home version So people want to recreate that arcade experience at home Guitar Hero had no arcade machine
4126775	4127095	I don't know.
4129196	4130176	It just seems a little silly.
4130876	4131556	It's a lot of money.
4132777	4134857	You could feed the starving children.
4135638	4138599	Think back to the story on the PlayStation 3 cost.
4138679	4144120	Anyway, I wanted to point this out as well, speaking of music games.
4145141	4147601	Big news in the DDR world this week.
4147801	4152403	Not only is DDR now being promoted through Burger King, of all things.
4152443	4153383	Did you see the little toy?
4153683	4155244	Miklatov actually got one of the little toys.
4155304	4156544	It's the dancing Boldo
4157302	4159643	You can press the little button and he does a little disco dance.
4159823	4161023	It's all kinds of stupid.
4161784	4173348	But the other big news, if you've been following DDR for a couple of years, then you know that folks were able to find that somewhere on the DDR Extreme disc, the song Memories was hidden away.
4173848	4177009	And people were figuring out for years, how are we going to get this song?
4177069	4178550	How is this song supposed to be unlocked?
4178890	4182532	And everybody thought, oh, maybe it'll be unlocked when Supernova comes out.
4182552	4184172	There'll be some type of link data, whatever it is.
4184532	4185393	Well, it turns out...
4187398	4192339	Sure enough, this week an unlock code was released through the Burger King promotion for Memories.
4192519	4196620	So you can finally unlock it legitimately, not using any type of Game Genie style hacks.
4197181	4200381	You can actually unlock it legitimately in DDR Extreme US.
4200401	4210864	You just plug a controller in port 2, right 4 times, up 3 times, square 1 time, left 2 times, down 3 times, square 2 times, and select 1 time.
4211405	4212025	Thank you for watching!
4225436	4254607	I think this is how they've remedied the situation that was created when the link data and Supernova kind of fell through because you noticed it was removed from the final version so there's no link data and no Supernova I bet you anything that was how it was supposed to happen but because it didn't happen this way you got the debug code instead I would bet money that that's what happened I would bet money and I swear I don't know anything I realize we have folks from Konami that come on the program but they haven't told me anything
4255097	4256458	That's my personal thought.
4258339	4258740	All right.
4260161	4264964	That's all the news we have for you tonight, but we do want to take some of your calls because we're an interactive program.
4264984	4265965	So why don't you give us a call?
4266145	4267506	I want to do one thing.
4267887	4268067	What?
4268267	4269508	Because Jamie's not here.
4269588	4270188	Website of the week.
4270909	4271229	Okay.
4271309	4271649	Oh, sure.
4272010	4273211	Well, then hold on.
4273231	4276393	I have to get some theme music for you if you want a website of the week.
4276753	4280356	Unfortunately, I don't have Jamie's typical song loaded, so you get this.
4283598	4284059	I hate you.
4285544	4287205	Anyway, Loki's website of the week.
4288345	4289245	I thought this would be cool.
4289285	4293707	They just ran a story about this thing that they've got going for Nintendo.
4293747	4295607	It's actually for like a Christmas calendar type thing.
4297228	4304771	www.mission-in-snowdriftland.com Drift.
4306331	4306891	Yeah, funny.
4307371	4311973	But it's a bunch of little mini games that you can play and it's counting down to Christmas.
4312902	4316284	and I don't know what exactly it is but each game is kind of like Mario.
4317845	4318546	What's the website again?
4319386	4332014	It's www.mission-in-snowdriftland.com and they've got a game for each calendar day and of course each one is unlocked as the days go on.
4333415	4333855	Alright.
4334895	4336556	Loki's website of the week, boys and girls.
4338378	4340659	Temporarily this week since DarkSakura is on vacation.
4341881	4345965	Raven's Dolphin The HDTVs and that lawsuit.
4346045	4347606	I've been actually reading up on it.
4349008	4350989	People seem like they're just out for money.
4351009	4354172	I said it before.
4367061	4372625	The trigger runs through Bluetooth, not IR, and this thing is not motion sensitive.
4372925	4378409	It's just through this crappy D-pad, and it looks like a Star Trek phaser.
4380250	4388736	Why do you think they are, then, if they don't believe that they have this product first, why do you think they're going through with this lawsuit, which is not a cheap process?
4391021	4394722	Well, I know that, but I think they're going to sue him because they're babies.
4394982	4399243	I guess the CEO said to his kids, I want a Wii, I want a Wii, I want a Wii.
4399903	4402104	I can't get a Wii, so let's sue Nintendo.
4402524	4403244	Oh, come on.
4403264	4407985	You're thinking because some guy at this company could not get a Wii that they're going to sue Nintendo?
4408286	4409686	That's a little bit far-fetched, don't you think?
4409706	4414807	Well, a little, but, you know, it's just, so it's this thing, you know.
4414907	4416968	Do you believe that they're actually going to win?
4417168	4417568	I don't.
4418564	4419085	One more thing.
4419105	4420386	Have you even heard of this company?
4420406	4421567	This company, Interlink.
4421587	4423930	Have you ever heard of it?
4423950	4425812	This company, Interlink.
4426092	4426913	Have you ever heard of it?
4439076	4442097	push-button thingers for people who give lectures, like myself.
4442357	4447197	You'd think I would have heard of them, but we... Mine comes through the projector, which is made by... Who is our projector?
4447237	4447738	InFocus.
4448598	4449558	Here's a question, though, Rob.
4450398	4453619	Does the Wii do PowerPoint presentations?
4453639	4454139	No, it doesn't.
4454499	4457279	Granted, you could probably use the photo channel for that, but that's beyond the point.
4457999	4462140	No, I think the fact that the trigger uses Bluetooth and the other one's infrared is going to be the end of this lawsuit.
4462160	4467841	But the thing is, though, is they have a patent for game controller device or whatever like that,
4468188	4471649	This is a patent for no remote control for PC.
4471789	4476170	I think it's going to be completely different, and they're probably going to throw it out once this comes in.
4476970	4478410	Hey, you know what, RavensDolphin?
4479230	4488252	RavensDolphin, BlackWolf in our chatroom is accusing you of stealing the Wii for the Kid joke from his show and is threatening a lawsuit.
4490632	4491193	BlackWolf?
4491553	4492073	Yeah, I am.
4492533	4493213	Oh, okay.
4493982	4495022	I'm sorry, Blackwood.
4495082	4495983	Kill me later.
4496303	4500324	Alright, well now you have to plug Blackwolf Show, or else we're all getting sued.
4500344	4501565	Fine, I listened to the night.
4501625	4506406	Bobby Blackwolf Show, 8 o'clock on Sunday nights before Orange Lounge.
4506766	4507727	That's 8 o'clock Eastern.
4509087	4509687	5 o'clock Pacific.
4510227	4511068	5 o'clock Pacific.
4511188	4511868	Alright, there you go.
4512341	4515202	Alright, any other quick thoughts, Raven Stauffen, before we get some more call?
4515502	4524725	Yeah, one quick... If I was going to buy an HDTV, I'm just going to bring in my Xbox 360, hook it up to one of my televisions, and see how it looks on there.
4524765	4526026	Twitter said I could do that.
4526686	4527526	Well, then there you go.
4527586	4529167	If the store will let you do that, then go for it.
4530647	4531468	That's what I'm going to do.
4531528	4533968	I'm not going to sit there and go, hmm, does this look good?
4534008	4535629	No, I want to see it firsthand.
4536249	4538030	Alright, well have fun with that, Raven Stauffen.
4538070	4540651	We've got to go to some more calls, but thank you so much for your phone call.
4540691	4541331	We appreciate it.
4544075	4552277	Hey guys, this is FootyMonster Hey, FootyMonster, what's on your mind, buddy?
4553958	4559219	I just wanted to go on about the whole Wimbledon accident thing Sure, what about it?
4560940	4561680	Well, basically...
4562333	4573307	If they do sue Nintendo about their Wii mode accidents, shouldn't they sue like baseball making company persons and like people who play soccer in the street and hit a person on the head with a ball or something?
4574574	4578797	No one's going to get sued over... I mean, have there actually been any lawsuits yet on this, Loki?
4579077	4586421	I'm not hearing that there actually has been a lawsuit on this yet, but they'd be so stupid, because exactly the point that FootyMonster's bringing up here, you know what?
4586921	4591924	Accidents with toys happen around the house all the time, and do they get sued over it?
4592024	4595727	No, not unless the toy, you know, starts a fire, but that's a little different.
4596467	4597888	I haven't heard of any lawsuits yet.
4599688	4614411	If you actually go to Engadget, there is a picture of a boy who was playing with the cousins with a Wii, and one of the cousins was playing with a baseball game on the Wii Sports, and hit him on the head with a Wii Remote, and he has a whole mark on his forehead from the Wii Remote.
4615049	4616531	and, you know, it's going to start happening.
4616611	4621097	There's going to be parents going to sue Nintendo about the Wiimote and, you know, their children game.
4621377	4632492	But at the same time, Wii Sports shows a disclaimer right before you go into the game and it even shows the guy spinning around going, make sure there is nothing around you before you start playing this game.
4632532	4633193	And that would...
4633893	4635514	Include your little brother.
4635874	4638955	So they were at fault for not reading the disclaimer, honestly.
4639095	4647118	I mean, you know, sucks to be the kid, but, you know, don't run at somebody who's flailing their arms about like crazy, you know?
4647598	4650519	Well, it's still, yeah, but it doesn't prevent the bad publicity.
4650539	4657262	I mean, it doesn't prevent, you know, the chatty poos of the world going all over it about how, you know, he can turn the hurt to children.
4657282	4657642	Not bad.
4658021	4666504	I'll give you that, it doesn't do any good for Nintendo's publicity, but somebody needs to put their foot down and say, look, Nintendo is not, you know, these guys are just being idiots.
4668565	4669185	Yeah, I agree.
4669485	4672206	Well, that's all I wanted to say, and just kind of make a quick FU of it.
4672386	4672986	Sure, sure.
4673306	4673606	Why not?
4675687	4680209	Okay, my little brother has a chicken pox, I never got him before, so I'm 23 and I'm about to get him.
4680529	4683150	Uh-oh, run for the hills, you don't want that at the age of 23.
4684505	4687706	So, you don't get chicken pox, you get shingles.
4688326	4688866	Oh, yuck.
4688926	4689667	Gross, gross.
4689987	4691027	Alright, stay far away.
4691127	4694488	We'll pray or something that you don't get it.
4696449	4696949	Okay, guys.
4697049	4699429	Alright, have a good one, buddy, and stay away from chicken pox.
4700470	4701030	You too, guys.
4701190	4701410	Thanks.
4702210	4704071	Well, I had it when I was seven, so I don't have to worry.
4704111	4705271	Did you have chicken pox when you were younger?
4705371	4706031	I've never gotten them.
4706331	4706912	Oh, shit.
4706932	4708332	You better be careful.
4708492	4710493	How can you get chicken pox four times?
4710973	4711413	I don't know.
4712142	4712983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4734151	4738054	and my tonsils are all in too.
4738794	4741876	And I have all my wisdom teeth too.
4742336	4743497	I am one whole person.
4744358	4745318	Alright, let's go to a call.
4745658	4746679	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4746699	4747019	Who's this?
4748200	4750782	You obviously know who this is, Legend of Zaku.
4751022	4756845	Well, hi Legend of Zaku, but you see it's radio and on the radio they can't see my little Skype screen that shows me who's calling.
4756866	4760688	And to be honest, I'll just click the button and whoever happens to be up gets lucky.
4761115	4764816	Unless somebody's like calling repeatedly throughout the show, I'll not pick them up.
4764876	4766176	But anyway, you got lucky.
4766196	4766836	Your call got through.
4766856	4767336	What do you want to say?
4768196	4773657	Well, basically, I've been... Well, I want to throw out this question before, you know, before anything.
4774397	4789340	Suppose that you want, you know, that someone or something, you know, some entity were supposed to, you know, wanted to create a game on a mobile cell phone, you know, more like they want to create like a, you know,
4790177	4797185	Rhythm Base Game What would be the best way, in your honest opinion, on how to approach this?
4797286	4797786	You don't.
4798147	4799688	Not in this country on these phones.
4799949	4801310	Don't put out a Rhythm Base Game.
4801330	4802151	Wait, wait, wait.
4802171	4802211	No.
4802291	4805395	Before you say that, I happen to work with these phones.
4805415	4807257	Okay, no, I mean... I mean...
4808158	4808739	I understand.
4809279	4809780	And you know what?
4809840	4815064	Phones are almost there because we have phones that can play the MP3s and all that stuff.
4815104	4822650	But right now they don't really do it through, unless you know something I don't, they don't really play the CD quality songs through the little Java games.
4823250	4824271	Yeah, but that's the thing.
4824651	4828074	It's not supposed to be that sophisticated.
4828094	4830336	It's supposed to be within the capacity of the cell phone.
4831036	4832538	Now, you know, I'm going to rephrase it.
4833238	4836661	You know, assuming the cell, you know, within the capacity...
4837119	4837719	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4867125	4870307	Maybe it's about pressing the keys at the right time or whatever.
4870588	4875712	But even then, I don't know, I honestly can't imagine a game like that being too incredibly thrilling.
4875992	4878233	I don't know, maybe they've had some nice visuals or something.
4879074	4880115	What about feature-wise?
4880855	4884058	You know, like internet ranking or downloadable content?
4884458	4885039	Sure, why not?
4885319	4887640	Downloadable stuff, all that stuff is good.
4887821	4892984	Yeah, basically more like a game and a personalization app at the same time.
4894426	4894926	Okay, sure.
4896096	4896396	I can see.
4896596	4899017	Look at the rankings or whatever.
4899057	4900017	That's always fun, I guess.
4900377	4901197	All right, well, there you have it.
4901237	4902298	What was your other question?
4902318	4902978	We've got to keep moving.
4903018	4904018	What else was on your mind?
4905018	4905918	Well, I don't know.
4905959	4911160	I've been talking to Ranma recently, and I know this was something else.
4911180	4913820	By the way, sorry, completely different topic.
4913940	4916201	Ranma, I saw Ranma on GameTapTV.
4916992	4920573	I was just kind of curious what kind of stuff they were showing on GameTapTV.
4920613	4934556	And if you go to their recent, I don't know, whatever it is that Victor Lucas hosts, the GameTap News thing or whatever the heck it is, you can see Ranma for like a split second in this little montage of what was going on at the Wii launch.
4934816	4939817	And I would have missed him if it wasn't for the fact that he's the only black Luigi I know anywhere.
4940737	4941757	You can spot him a mile away.
4941797	4942458	Anyway, sorry.
4942818	4944438	Yes, so about your conversation with Ranma.
4945781	4963315	Let me see, I know we were planning to do, well, in other words, I don't know if you guys would, let's say that, you know, to put it this way, I've been having conversations with various other DDR players on something that we plan to do for charity.
4963335	4974945	It hasn't been set in stone yet, but we need more support and backing, and basically, in the event that this does happen, I don't know how much support you're willing to give us.
4977273	4978954	We're planning to do something along that line.
4978974	4981255	Some sort of gaming event for a cause.
4981275	4984556	Is it more original than the we're going to break the Guinness Book of World Records thing?
4997763	5000404	We haven't determined that yet.
5000464	5002145	Right now it's in exploratory mode.
5002425	5008348	All I'm going to say is that if you're going to do the Guinness Book of World Records thing, that thing's been done like six times now.
5008388	5010308	So please do something to make it more original.
5010388	5010889	Okay, good.
5011269	5016051	No, we're probably doing something completely different, like a big gathering of gamers.
5016731	5018952	We don't care about the records as long as we raise money.
5021097	5024919	Whatever you decide, sure, put it in writing, send it to us, we'll consider anything.
5024939	5030002	We have some of our listeners that run anime conventions that want us to come, and if we can reasonably make it, sure.
5030442	5034765	Especially if the event is in California, we have an easy time making it.
5034785	5040408	The whole purpose of this is just to shed the other side of the DDR community.
5040808	5044550	More the charitable and heartful side of it.
5044810	5045451	Sounds good to me.
5045531	5047772	If we can't be there in person, we can at least send some prizes.
5048709	5051410	Well, yeah, whatever you're able to provide us, that'll be cool.
5051711	5051991	All right.
5052011	5054612	Well, we can't turn this program into a sales pitch, so send me an email.
5054632	5055552	We'll see what we can do, okay?
5055993	5056293	All right.
5056453	5056733	All right.
5057013	5058154	Saku, thanks so much for your call.
5058174	5058854	Have a good one, okay?
5059294	5059534	Okay.
5059675	5059955	All right.
5060355	5062276	Good luck with your event and your cell phone game.
5063016	5063396	Yes, Loki.
5063436	5070380	I'd like to make a mention real quick that you were talking about earlier when we were discussing the Spike TV Video Game Award winners.
5071331	5075552	We didn't really leak them because they just put out a press release with all the winners now.
5076133	5076793	Oh, well, whatever.
5076833	5079714	I mean, every freaking game website had that list anyway.
5080094	5082034	It's not like we're telling you anything that revolutionary.
5082054	5083975	You know what cell phone game they should work on?
5084655	5088857	It's called Stop Playing With Your Cell Phone and Drive Your Fucking SUV.
5089157	5089657	The game.
5092758	5093438	I like that idea.
5094090	5096732	Alright, thank you guys so much for all your great calls on Skype tonight.
5096772	5098734	We are going to close the Skype line at this time.
5099354	5101296	Of course, if you didn't get through, you can always leave us a voicemail.
5101876	5110883	Our voicemail of the week, 1-877-GAME-OLR and leave us your thoughts and that's available to the many of you that listen to us on the podcast.
5110903	5111504	We appreciate that.
5112124	5114826	Alright, Loki, any last minute stories?
5117048	5117508	Not really.
5117588	5119390	Nothing that I really want to mention, I guess.
5119570	5119950	I don't know.
5120110	5120391	Wow.
5121491	5122712	I forgot to mention I played...
5125101	5128625	It was such an impact on me that I forgot the name of the game even.
5128865	5131267	The new Xbox Live Arcade game, Roboblitz.
5132368	5132828	I played that.
5133009	5133669	It was okay.
5133729	5134890	I played it for like two seconds.
5134910	5135951	I didn't get it.
5136192	5136932	I didn't buy it.
5137353	5138113	I didn't buy it either.
5138153	5138874	I played the demo.
5138974	5140435	So, yeah.
5140736	5142057	I'll give it another try a little later.
5142117	5143879	Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood when I played it.
5144039	5144519	I guess.
5144679	5146461	It was interesting.
5146721	5146961	It was...
5147870	5150612	You know what they really need to put out on Xbox Live Arcade?
5151032	5151533	MDK.
5151893	5153034	MDK would be awesome.
5153174	5153734	I'd be pretty rad.
5154154	5154935	I would love MDK.
5155355	5155595	Alright.
5156016	5157977	Well, I guess that's it for the show.
5158197	5158978	We're all out of news.
5159538	5162340	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.
5162360	5163280	You guys are awesome.
5164585	5165406	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5192799	5193419	That's going to do it.
5193459	5195181	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5195521	5199063	Gee, I guess we'll start with, I guess, Loki.
5200304	5204186	My final thought is that popcorn shrimp was delicious.
5205547	5210290	And my final thought is now everybody's gone to dinner without me and DarkSakura's not here.
5210630	5213212	So we can't go say hi to our favorite waitress at Lions.
5213232	5214033	That makes me sad.
5214613	5215774	Hi, Jeannie, if you're listening.
5215794	5216174	We love you.
5218322	5220143	Thanks again everybody and we'll see you next week.
5220183	5222263	We will be live again next week with another program.
5222663	5230666	I hear it might be the holiday episode because DarkSakura was saying something about Chris coming back and Chris wants to do some holiday joy with us.
5230706	5231526	So that should be fun.
5232106	5234587	Ho, ho, ho next week on Orange Lounge Radio.
5234607	5235207	We'll see you then.
