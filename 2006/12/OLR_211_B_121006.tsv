22920	35120	The opinions rendered herein are those of the guests, not necessarily those of the guests,
35120	39840	girls do when they go to LA. I know she's been making a lot of LJ posts, which by the
39840	44040	way reminds me to pimp the LiveJournal community. It's a good time. We have a lot of people
44040	48560	there and we like to post show updates and sometimes there will be random discussion
48560	53220	threads as well. Check it out if you're a LiveJournal user. Orange Lounge is our name
53220	60220	on LiveJournal. Also, we have a MySpace. MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Give me more friends.
60740	64980	We want more friends. And by the way, clips of old shows are also on there and sometimes
64980	70100	we post announcements as bulletins and fun things like that. We won't spam you too much
70100	75660	on MySpace, we promise. We used to post little pictures when people would add us, like of
75660	79420	little game-related things. We'll probably get back into doing that pretty soon, so maybe
79420	85320	give people incentive to add us because we'll comment on you. The only people that have
85320	88600	a login for that are myself, Loki, and DarkSakura, so you know if you get that, it's one of us
88600	95300	doing it. So, add us on MySpace. It's fun. Yes. Do that or we'll kill the ferret. Anyway,
95300	102300	let's get back into some news. Anyways, so this one website, reghardware.co.uk, is saying
104240	111260	that Sony is going to ship a major PS3 firmware update in March. And what will it contain?
111260	118260	We don't know. But last, SC Europe VP of Technology, Paul Holman, cited by an Australian website,
120420	126860	Smart House, said, new features and new gaming capabilities. Well, that could be anything.
126860	133060	God damn people. You know, actually, you know, it's only bad enough that we report on this
133060	137820	because it's someone reporting on someone else reporting on something else saying, there
137820	144820	will be new things coming. Where is equally the blame? I guess there's not too much to
145260	149140	be surprised here. What I think is interesting about this story is that if they do release
149140	153540	a big firmware update in March, then it looks like they might be kind of mirroring a little
153540	157700	bit what the 360 is doing with their biannual updates, right? Because they have to do the
157700	160980	fall update and the spring update, at least that's what they promise. And I believe they
160980	164900	were doing that on the old school Xbox as well, so this would, you know, kind of line
164900	171460	up with that. It makes sense. One of the rumors, because one of the stories ran, was that it
171460	178460	would be the 1080i fix. And, well, we know that's not the case because they already released
179420	186420	that. Alright, well, you know, if this whole PlayStation 3 thing is just not for you, this
187780	193540	blogger over at 3dgamer.blogspot.com posted this big list of things you could do instead
193540	199320	of buying a PlayStation 3. You could fly to London. You could pay your rent for a month.
199320	206320	You could buy 300 Big Macs or 3,000 bandages. You could buy 60 large cheese pizzas, 250
206620	212340	gallons of gas. You could buy a 1988 Mazda 323. I guess that's the Blue Book value of
212340	216540	it. You could buy 15 shares of Sony Corps, though that might not be the best idea right
216540	222440	now. You could take a skydiving course and do four jumps. You could get a personal trainer
222440	229440	and do 17 sessions at the gym. You could buy 225 pounds of canned tuna. Or, and it ends
230140	235060	here on a nice on note, you could provide food, shelter, and clothing for two children
235060	241300	for an entire year and have $150 left over for something nice for yourself. What this
241300	246460	doesn't address are the eBay profiteers, though. They don't factor that in. So, I think they
246460	251180	should have said, you know, all these eBay profiteers are stealing from the poor, defenseless
251180	255140	children who have no roof over their head, you bastards.
255140	256140	Think of the children.
256140	259180	I know. Why isn't anyone thinking of the children?
259180	265140	But can you play Resistance on 225 pounds of tuna? I think not. At least that's what
265140	266140	Sony would tell you.
266140	267140	Anywho...
267140	272140	You can't play Ridge Racer with 30 years' worth of toothpaste.
272140	279140	Oh, anyways. Well, definitely time for some wonderful street dates, as always. And I like
279140	285480	to start things off, like we normally do, with some exclusive street dates that you
285480	288440	probably haven't heard from any place else.
288440	292920	So let's get going here. Now, there's a few stories that came out this week with games
292920	299120	that are coming out. One of those, of course, is D3's Simple 2000 series game for the 360
299120	305560	called Earth Defense Force X. And that's coming out on the 360 in the United States on March
305560	310840	21st. And it's only going to be retailing for $39.99. So not bad. I'm glad they're actually
310840	313120	bringing out some cool games like that.
313120	320120	One game that we saw a little bit about, I think last month, was Def Jam Icon. It will
320360	326960	be coming out on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 on March 7th. March is, of course, a big
326960	330400	month for gaming beyond November here.
330400	335440	Of course, around the same time, we're also going to be getting Godfather on the PlayStation
335440	342440	3. Yay, a game that's over a year old now. And Godfather the game on the Wii. Now, that
342800	345720	hasn't been said anywhere yet. That'll be interesting.
345720	348720	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Godfather on the Wii?
348720	350440	Godfather on the Wii.
350440	351040	The fuck?
351040	355920	That'll be fun. I can't wait to play it.
355920	359080	I mean, you're going to get to bitch-slap someone with a controller and it'll, like,
359080	360040	actually work?
360040	360440	I think so.
360440	363600	That might be kind of fun, actually. They really do need Grand Theft Auto on the Wii,
363600	364080	don't they?
364080	364880	Oh, I can't wait.
364880	368200	I want to, you know, be able to pull the hooker out of the car, like, in the real motion,
368200	369200	and then, you know, bitch-slap her.
369200	371960	Anyways, Rainbow Six-
371960	372480	Rated M.
372480	377760	Rainbow Six Vegas for the PlayStation 3. One of those wonderful launch titles delayed to
377760	384760	March 14th. Co-PlayStation 3. A little bit, you know, more difficult to develop for, apparently,
386360	392240	than we thought. Sonic the Hedgehog also delayed on the PlayStation 3 until January 17th.
392240	396160	Oh, are they going to make the game fun?
396160	397200	Probably not.
397200	403160	SSX Blur, which is going to be coming out on the Wii, also coming out in March on March
403160	407480	14th, and that would look pretty cool. I can't wait. They've cheapified it a little bit,
407480	408400	and it looks pretty fun.
408400	412720	I like the cute little video I think you played on our pre-tape show last week. It looked
412720	413440	pretty cute.
413440	414480	Yeah.
414480	420440	Some other stuff. Forza 2 has been delayed until May 16th of next year. Yay.
420440	424920	There's some new DS games coming out, including Theme Park, which I think was announced this
424920	430760	week. That's coming out March 21st, 2007. And another game called Pogo Island, which
430760	432920	is coming out on March 27th.
432920	438920	Finally, Stranglehold, another launch game that was supposedly coming out on the PlayStation
438920	441760	3, delayed to June 1st of next year.
441760	447080	Sid Meier's Pirates on the PlayStation Portable is going to be coming out February 26th. This
447080	452480	one, as I teased on the Wednesday show, Charlie Brown All Stars for PlayStation 2 coming out
452480	453640	March 28th.
453640	454640	Rad.
454640	461080	And then finally, Silent Hill Origins, such an interesting game on the PS3, delayed all
461080	462480	the way to April 25th.
462480	467600	Hmm. Interesting. But of course, dates are subject to change, as they always are. And
467600	471000	one thing I wanted to ask you about, actually, this wasn't anywhere on the show world, but
471000	475040	something we put on OrangeOnTrader.com earlier this week is that folks have been spotted
475040	481240	on the internet playing DDR Universe on Xbox Live, which would indicate that the game has
481240	486160	gone gold, I would believe, or else the achievements and things would not be loaded on Xbox's servers
486160	489640	so that we could find them. So, March still?
489640	490640	So, March.
490640	494320	Are you sure? Because if the game's gone gold, don't you think this will make the January
494320	495320	date?
495320	496320	No.
496320	497320	All right.
497320	498320	Still positive it's in March.
498320	499840	Why? What makes you so damn sure?
499840	503320	Their January game is, or actually, they don't have a game in January.
503320	504320	Well, there you go.
504320	505320	February.
505320	506320	No.
506320	511640	Okay, they have games coming out in January. They have Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, I want to say, Tag
511640	515680	Force is coming out, and then, I don't think anything else.
515680	518160	Yeah, well, what if you go to work tomorrow and then, oop, the date got shifted. They
518160	519160	bumped it up.
519160	523360	They normally don't bump stuff up. I'm thinking they're waiting until March. March is the
523360	530040	big dates, you know, for games. It's the second push of the, or I guess, the first push of
530040	538520	the year, other than November. So, it's still going to stick to March. You'll see. You'll
538520	539520	see.
539520	540520	We will.
540520	541520	We will.
541520	542520	We will.
542520	543520	We will.
543520	544520	We will.
544520	545520	So, we shall see.
545520	547880	And just because they're playing it online, hey, remember, Pimps at Sea is online right
547880	548880	now. Does that mean he'll...
548880	552960	But you couldn't go in and see, like, the little graphics and all the achievements and
552960	555880	everything. Those weren't loaded on Xbox's servers. You couldn't do anything with that.
555880	558920	It just showed that they were playing Pimps at Sea. But with DDR Universe, that's how
558920	560200	we were able to get all the achievements.
560200	562200	So, it doesn't mean anything.
562200	564600	Oh, we'll see.
564600	565600	We will see.
565600	566600	We will see.
566600	567600	MF'er.
567600	573400	Let's go to our buddies over in the UK. Since Dark Sakura is not here this week, I'm filling
573400	578040	in with some dates that you will be getting some new games. Of course, things are starting
578040	582560	to slow down a little bit since it is getting towards the end of the year. But you do have
582560	587840	a few games coming out the week of the 15th, including Cats and Dogs 2006. Those are two
587840	591120	separate games, Cats and Dogs 2006.
591120	595520	Hamsters is also coming out on the DS, so that should be fun. Star Wars Lethal Alliance
595520	597320	on the DS, now that sounds pretty good.
597320	603420	Superman Returns, the video game on PlayStation 2. Oh. Oh. I played the demo of Superman Returns
603420	607080	for Xbox 360. Sucked.
607080	612240	You know, it was more fun to pick up a stranger and try to drop them in the ocean or leave
612240	615880	them on the beach and then fly away. Like, I had more fun with the whole sandbox element
615880	620600	than playing the actual game. It's pretty bad. I'm not going to pick up the full game
620600	624320	based off that demo. I know you're not supposed to make a final judgment of a game based off
624320	627320	a demo, but seriously, don't put it on Marketplace if you don't want people to do that.
627320	630440	I can't pull my pre-order from based off the demo.
630440	636200	Yeah, I can't say I blame you. Oh, also, The Sims 2 Pets coming out on the PSP, also from
636200	641480	EA. Far Cry Vengeance and Marvel Ultimate Alliance on the Wii on the 22nd. Also, Star
641480	645480	Trek Tactical Assault on the DS, also on the 22nd.
645480	651040	And also for the U.S. Sorry, did I cut you off? My bad. No, not yet. It's okay.
651040	654800	Anyways, so, the U.S. We've got some pretty good releases this week. Twilight Princess
654800	658880	on the GameCube, you know, for those who may not have a Wii yet. Definitely worth picking
658880	659880	up. Holdouts.
659880	663600	All your holdouts. Star Trek Legacy, which actually I think that
663600	668840	came out last week. Some of this list is wrong. Anyways, moving on.
668840	672040	I don't remember seeing Star Trek Legacy when I went to the store today.
672040	676600	I thought that was last week. It's moved around so many times it's hard for me to remember.
676600	681040	Blazing Angels on PlayStation 3. Yay.
681040	685520	And Fullmetal Alchemist Dual Sympathy on the DS.
685520	688960	What you hear is supposed to be better than the PlayStation 2 ones.
688960	693800	Let's see here. Elibits on the Wii. I can't wait to pick that one up. That one looks pretty
693800	696560	awesome. I want to get that too, yeah.
696560	703040	Let's see here. Then, I do believe on the PC we've got Rayman's Raving Rabbids finally
703040	708680	making its way out there. And, let's see here. Oh, there's actually a few other things on
708680	711040	the Wii. Metal Slug Anthology.
711040	716120	Chicken Little Ace in Action. Rainbow Six Vegas is finally making its way
716120	723780	on the PC. And then, on the PSP we've got Blitz Overtime.
723780	728920	Which is a part of Blitz League. And then, actually I don't think there's any
728920	735560	love for PlayStation 2. Not too much at least. College Hoops 2K7 which was delayed from the
735560	743080	original Xbox 360 launch. And then, yeah, that's about it.
743080	746960	December is really horrible for games. Yeah, I mean we got most of your big shit
746960	749320	already last month. Pretty much, yeah.
749320	754240	Japan, also kind of slow over there. But they are getting some releases including on December
754240	758440	14th on the Xbox 360 they're getting Phantasy Star Universe finally.
758440	761160	We actually got it first on the 360 here in America.
761160	764560	So, rumor is the Japanese and English servers are supposedly together.
764560	768240	So, you might start seeing some Japanese players start populating the game if you're an Xbox
768240	772120	360 player. Also, a game called Earth Defense Forces 3
772120	778400	coming out on the 14th of December. They're getting Lost Planet on December 21st
778400	782480	might I point out as well. Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Full Auto
782480	786000	2, Battle Lines. Oh, that's actually, is that the US release
786000	790800	actually? Could be? I believe that it came, the US one came out
790800	792840	last week. Oh, so they're getting I guess that over
792840	797720	in the Asian territories as well. Motorstorm, also the Japanese version of Motorstorm
797720	801140	coming out December 14th. We have to wait until March.
801140	805580	Coming out, well, trust me it isn't much. Coming out on the Wii, Pokemon Battle Revolution
805580	810120	and Rayman Raving Rabbids. Also, a title based off of Bleach is coming
810120	816960	out there as well on the Nintendo Wii. Coming out on the PlayStation 2, Beat Mania
816960	820080	2DX Happy Sky. A lot of you music game fans have been waiting
820080	822760	for that one. That is finally coming out this week, December
822760	825620	14th. So, be on the lookout for that.
825620	829320	Lots and lots of PS2 titles by the way coming out this week in Japan.
829320	836480	Nobunaga no Yabu. Actually, I think that's just going into best hits this week.
836480	841960	Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2 also going into the best hits.
841960	846520	And looks like a lot of games getting price reductions on the PS2 this week in Japan.
846520	849560	So check that out. Well, as I mentioned earlier.
849560	854100	Wait, one more, sorry, one more. I want to say on the DS, three Rockman games
854100	857520	coming out. Ryuusi no Rockman Dragon, Leo and Pegasus
857520	860960	all coming out December 14th. Now, what's the funniest game title for this
860960	863560	week? For the DS?
863560	868800	Just for anything. I don't know, there's not a lot of funny stuff
868800	871000	this week. Oh, here we go.
871000	875480	Stationary style set DS Lite, although that's not a game, it's just a set.
875480	879880	It's like a little, you know, like accessory. I don't know, that's the best I could do,
879880	881600	sorry. Okay, anyway.
881600	884000	No Love Hamster this week, sorry. Love Hamster.
884000	889720	Let's see, anyways, as I mentioned earlier, the PlayStation 3 just had a firmware update
889720	897840	and was fixing some of the issues that they had with 720p being downscaled to 480p for
897840	903120	those people that had older TVs that couldn't do the 720p and only did 1080i.
903120	909280	Well, apparently there's a firmware update now, the version 1.3, which actually made
909280	916640	attempts to patching that. It makes the 1080i the default resolution
916640	923160	now, and then the 720p as kind of secondary, so for the people that had, you know, the
923160	927480	1080i only HDTVs, you know, kind of fixed some of that.
927480	934240	However, though, there's still, if you want to watch a Blu-ray movie, the machine will
934240	938880	still scale it back, I guess, to 480p, so you have to switch it manually.
938880	942000	It sounds like that they've sort of fixed the problem, but not quite fixed it all the
942000	947040	way yet, so a little confusing, I guess, you know, mainly having switched up.
947040	952360	Why can't it be just simple, like the 360 where, you know, if it's in 1080i, it stays
952360	956800	in 1080i unless they pop in a DVD, which is only going to go to 480p anyways.
956800	961280	I mean, I don't know, why can't you just manually select your resolution?
961280	964720	That seems like it should make sense. Stop trying to think for me.
964720	970280	Well, I know Sony's been taking a lot of heat lately, but slowly but surely, we're starting
970280	974880	to hear some pretty rad things coming out of Sony, and I think this is pretty awesome.
974880	979000	Even though there is no, you know, price or date set for this, the PlayStation Network
979000	981840	is going to be getting Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.
981840	982840	I think that's pretty rad.
982840	983840	That's pretty awesome.
983840	984840	Yeah.
984840	988020	That's according to Famitsu Weekly, and Bandai Namco is going to be releasing this for the
988020	989440	download service.
989440	993280	Probably Japan will get this first, but at least gives us an idea of what's to come.
993280	998840	The PlayStation 3 version will feature full 1080p visual, and you'll also be able to play
998840	1003800	Jinpachi, who previously was unplayable because he was a boss in the arcade version.
1003800	1007080	All the various modes that you saw in the arcade game, including Arcade Battle, Ghost
1007080	1010680	Battle, Gallery, will also be available in the PlayStation 3 version.
1010680	1012480	No word, though, if you could play it online.
1012480	1015360	I mean, I think that would be a pretty cool addition, but then again, if they were to
1015360	1018520	go that far with it, shit, they could probably release it as a full game and make pretty
1018520	1019520	good money.
1019520	1023920	So, it'll be interesting to see how much they charge for this on the PlayStation Network.
1023920	1028680	Certainly could be one of the, you know, I think PlayStation's kind of been looking for
1028680	1037000	its geometry wars, and sure, you've got Blast Factor and Blow, or Blow, Flow, Flow seems
1037000	1040240	to look pretty cool if you've played the little web application online.
1040240	1042720	I'm not going to live that one down.
1042720	1044860	But this could be like the, you know, must have.
1044860	1048520	This in like Gran Turismo HD also coming out in the network, you know, they're going to
1048520	1052680	have some pretty powerful stuff on their network soon, so Sony, and you know, I guess they
1052680	1054000	got Lemmings this week, too.
1054000	1056400	Yeah, Lemmings 2, and it was a remake.
1056400	1058680	It was completely redone.
1058680	1059680	Lemmings 2 was fun.
1059680	1060680	I liked it.
1060680	1065280	So, slowly but surely is Sony making some waves in the online scene, I must say.
1065280	1068000	For once, I say, good job, Sony.
1068000	1074080	Yep, and actually Enchanted Arms for the PlayStation 3 is going to be getting some enhancements
1074080	1076440	as well.
1076440	1079520	It's kind of cool just to see that it's not just a port.
1079520	1082920	What they're going to be adding, though, are going to be some graphical tweaks, of course,
1082920	1088360	including new character animations, new chapters to the story, new golems will appear, and
1088360	1090000	the battle system will be improved.
1090000	1092200	Will the voice acting be improved?
1092200	1093400	I don't know about that.
1093400	1094400	Well, that's too bad.
1094400	1097880	Even the themes for the opening and ending will be recomposed by Mink.
1097880	1100240	That's kind of weird.
1100240	1101980	I wonder why.
1101980	1103840	It seemed fine in the 360 version.
1103840	1104840	Okay, whatever.
1104840	1106320	Whatever they want to do.
1106320	1111680	I would not pay $60 for this on PlayStation 3, though, when I already have it on Xbox.
1111680	1113520	It's a decent game.
1113520	1117920	I think for most people, unless you're like hardcore RPG, it's probably going to be a
1117920	1121520	little more of a rental for you, but I had a good time with it on 360.
1121520	1124760	I really do need to finish the damn game.
1124760	1125760	You know me.
1125760	1126760	I have gamer ADD.
1126760	1129120	I can never stick with one game too long.
1129120	1134820	Well, a lot of flack coming Sony's way, even though we just said something nice about them.
1134820	1139840	Of course, other folks out there like to, ourselves included, we're no less guilty,
1139840	1141280	have given Sony a lot of flack.
1141280	1142640	This is very interesting.
1142640	1146880	Again, your favorite, Loki, the analyst groups.
1146880	1154120	This analyst group called Symphonie has noticed that as far as market influence goes, HD DVD
1154120	1160960	has a 46% more positive discussions when it comes to websites than Blu-ray.
1160960	1165560	About half as many people are impressed with Blu-ray visuals than are with HD DVD visuals.
1165560	1168480	I guess these guys are scanning websites to see what people are saying.
1168480	1171760	Of course, they don't say what websites they're looking at, but whatever.
1171760	1175040	Now what's interesting about this is that they say the key reasons for the low Blu-ray
1175040	1183780	acceptance is the forced inclusion on the PlayStation 3 and Sony's previous format reputation.
1183780	1188660	This might be alluding to the fact that PlayStation 3 might actually be being harmed by the fact
1188660	1191600	that the Blu-ray is a forced thing on it.
1191600	1196400	Just like the UMDs, UMDs didn't really take off either.
1196400	1199400	We all know why UMDs didn't work, because they were charging more than they were for
1199400	1203120	the DVDs and there wasn't as much on them, and that you couldn't watch them on a TV.
1203120	1207320	It was a stupid format from the beginning, really.
1207320	1210800	If they had charged half as much as the DVDs, I bet the format would have done a whole lot
1210800	1211800	better.
1211800	1213800	A whole lot better.
1213800	1220440	I just want to say, by the way, what a report like this could do is it could make more of
1220440	1225600	those movie studios want to put out HD DVDs, which in the end is going to really hurt Sony.
1225600	1230360	It is going to hurt them, because pretty soon it's not going to be...
1230360	1234080	And that's the thing with Blu-ray and HD DVD.
1234080	1240160	I don't think anyone is really jumping into it right now either, because I buy a movie
1240160	1241400	that's in...
1241400	1243080	I buy an HD DVD player.
1243080	1247440	Well, now some of my movies are going to be on this format and some of them aren't.
1247440	1248440	So what?
1248440	1249440	I have to buy two different players?
1249440	1250440	Fuck that shit.
1250440	1252280	I ain't going to buy that stuff.
1252280	1256840	Everyone's waiting until one format prevails and that's what they're going to buy.
1256840	1260760	Black Wolf, our good buddy Bobby Black Wolf is in chat right now, and he's bringing up
1260760	1262560	an interesting point.
1262560	1269120	He says HD DVD has a reference DVD that really shows off the power of the format, King Kong.
1269120	1271840	Blu-ray doesn't really have a comparable reference DVD.
1271840	1276720	He says Talladega Nights, which you might be thinking, not really a good choice, because
1276720	1281400	King Kong was more of an action type movie and big special effects.
1281400	1286360	Talladega Nights, maybe a few racing scenes here and there, but otherwise not exactly
1286360	1292560	a big explosions and manly man movie to show off the effects.
1292560	1297320	What they need to do is they need to fucking bring out the special edition of Final Fantasy
1297320	1299120	Advent Children.
1299120	1301800	That shit would blow people away.
1301800	1303160	Might not be a bad title for Blu-ray.
1303160	1307320	That's the only thing I want Blu-ray for is that movie, but GS68 says they should use
1307320	1308320	snakes on a plane.
1308320	1313360	I don't think the snakes on a plane should be used for a reference for anything other
1313360	1315680	than crappy movie.
1315680	1322840	Anyways, so the PlayStation 3, Sony is of course talking about improvements that they're
1322840	1325600	possibly going to make to the system as well.
1325600	1330520	They're talking about introducing new third party applications and hardware, new controller
1330520	1334720	schemes like the Eye of Judgment that's going to suck and-
1334720	1337760	Shit, we haven't heard about that in a long time, have we?
1337760	1339840	Maybe they went back and made it better.
1339840	1341120	That was supposed to be a launch title.
1341120	1342400	What ever fucking happened to that?
1342400	1347280	Oh, I know, because it sucks as a game console peripheral, because you have to have this
1347280	1349560	giant elaborate set up to play a card game.
1349560	1350560	No, I don't think so.
1350560	1352880	That's not what I'm going to spend my $600 on.
1352880	1354720	But it's the Eye of Judgment.
1354720	1357560	At least that's how they were always introducing it.
1357560	1359320	The Eye of Judgment.
1359320	1364760	Yeah, they could have gotten away with the brown Eye of Judgment and take a dump on your
1364760	1365760	console.
1365760	1371400	Anyways, so it's kind of interesting though about the whole article and this one text
1371400	1377960	site Smart House saying that Sony will launch a PlayStation 4 but not any sooner than 2010.
1377960	1382360	Wait a second, I thought the PlayStation 3 is future proof and it's going to have a ten
1382360	1383360	year cycle.
1383360	1384360	Oopsies.
1384360	1393760	Anyways, so, duh, they're going to be adding more content and more stuff like iTunes and
1393760	1395960	blah, blah, blah.
1395960	1399600	It's going to basically be the same thing as all the other consoles out there.
1399600	1406600	They're going to offer download services for video and for music and for games.
1406600	1410920	It's not a big surprise.
1410920	1415160	Unless they said, you know, the PlayStation 4 is going to print money.
1415160	1423160	I'm surprised that Circuit City ad did not say that the DS prints money or something
1423160	1424160	like that.
1424160	1426920	I keep thinking of that picture I've seen all throughout the internet where it says
1426920	1427920	it prints money.
1427920	1430960	It has the happy Iwata and Miyamoto.
1430960	1436400	Anyway, I'm thinking about PlayStation 4 and I kind of think about it in my mind.
1436400	1438280	I know it's way too early to think about it.
1438280	1439400	What could really be better?
1439400	1443600	I mean, graphically these games are starting to look so realistic.
1443600	1446920	It's hard to imagine what could be even better, but I guess you never know.
1446920	1449080	I mean, I guess I won't know it until I see it.
1449080	1453280	And you know, a lot of us probably thought the same thing when the NES first came out.
1453280	1456960	Like, oh man, this is so much better than Atari 2600.
1456960	1458520	Games will never look better than this.
1458520	1462760	Listen, okay, the PlayStation 4 is going to be able to put out games at fucking 240 frames
1462760	1469400	per second and it's going to be in full 2160p.
1469400	1473480	Yes, but will it have the Eye of Judgment?
1473480	1474800	Of course it will.
1474800	1478920	And you know what the Eye of Judgment is going to be used for now?
1478920	1480080	Plane checkers.
1480080	1484440	Because checkers have never been so extreme.
1484440	1491160	Seriously, do you, I mean, I don't know about you, but like, if you were to play Magic Cards,
1491160	1496200	do you actually imagine, like, throwing a fireball at somebody or are your monsters
1496200	1497200	actually attacking?
1497200	1500160	Or is it just more of a strategy game that you're playing as characters?
1500160	1505280	I mean, do you really need the visual representation of your monster attacking some other monster?
1505280	1510520	And is that really worth the, you know, $600 for the console and there's a giant elaborate
1510520	1514200	setup that looks like it would never work as a peripheral?
1514200	1520280	I mean, and can you really imagine yourself, I bought this system and I bought these special
1520280	1525600	cards which, by the way, can probably be photocopied and used in the game, you know, instead of
1525600	1529760	buying these special decks because there's no copy protection against these cards.
1529760	1533560	I want to see them release this thing because it's the dumbest idea on the face here.
1533560	1537520	I remember when we went and saw this thing being demonstrated at E3, I walked out of
1537520	1539760	there and go, what the fuck was that?
1539760	1542160	I mean, this is not going to work as a game.
1542160	1545420	Which is funny because Miyamoto was going in right after us and I think you probably
1545420	1548060	heard that.
1548060	1552480	It was the dumbest thing, they were like, I wanted to raise my hand and go, why would
1552480	1553480	you buy this?
1553480	1555600	I mean, really, this is stupid.
1555600	1560200	And with the tech demo right now, great, leave it as a tech demo, then you see it as a launch
1560200	1561200	game.
1561200	1563440	No, it's stupid.
1563440	1568560	Just stop wasting the time on this and produce some better games.
1568560	1572720	I like the brown eye of judgment, that's something they should do.
1572720	1579840	I'm seriously, I mean, the brown eye of judgment would be more of a beneficial peripheral than
1579840	1588680	the fucking, you know, at least it would be neat, you know, I mean, like, look, the PlayStation
1588680	1594160	3 just took a dump, I mean, that's a lot cooler than saying, look, I made a card game, I mean,
1594160	1595160	come on.
1595160	1601120	I mean, they have the little dollies that will fucking take a dump when you feed them,
1601120	1605840	I mean, if your console can do the same thing, that'd be kind of neat, I guess.
1605840	1614280	I don't know, I can't just imagine with the brown eye of judgment when you're doing so
1614280	1619920	horribly in a game, the console shits itself.
1619920	1623880	Wait, you know, they have rumble on your-
1623880	1630740	My Sony, my Sony, wherever I go, he goes.
1630740	1633800	It's like this, okay, you know how they have the rumble features, you know, when there's
1633800	1639400	something scary on the screen, it'll shake, well, now your console can actually shit itself
1639400	1641680	when something scary is on the screen.
1641680	1647840	I mean, this is how ridiculous this peripheral is, I mean, I really wish our listeners could
1647840	1652060	have been there at E3 when they're demonstrating this thing, because it was the most ridiculous
1652060	1653060	peripheral.
1653060	1654060	It was like-
1654060	1657000	Isn't somebody in the room like it was you or somebody asked, like, what the hell's the
1657000	1658000	point of this thing?
1658000	1661520	Like, I swear to God, someone asked the question, like, what are you going to do with this?
1661520	1662520	I mean-
1662520	1663520	Like, is this it?
1663520	1667680	Like, I swear you asked, like, is this it?
1667680	1669000	Could I just copy the guards?
1669000	1671160	I mean, seriously, what is it?
1671160	1673600	And they raced us out of there.
1673600	1675480	It was so horrible.
1675480	1676800	Sorry.
1676800	1684880	I like this, Jeremy Todd one says, the brown eye of judgment, this thing is the shit.
1684880	1699120	You know what else never gets old is stories about stupid children and stupid parents.
1699120	1705960	A South Carolina woman recently called the cops on her 12-year-old son and had him arrested,
1705960	1712120	charged with petty larceny for stealing a Christmas present from under the tree.
1712120	1713360	What does this have to do with games?
1713360	1715640	Well, it was a Game Boy Advance.
1715640	1721960	Now, supposedly, this actually follows a string of crimes committed by the kid, shoplifting,
1721960	1724960	stealing from mom's wallet, and, oh, punching a cop.
1724960	1732280	Well, I'm glad that they got him in before it was too late, you know?
1732280	1733720	Next thing you know, he's going to murder someone-
1733720	1735200	Stealing from Santa Claus.
1735200	1737160	No, no, no, that's a big no-no.
1737160	1740120	You know what they should do when they take him into court, they should say, so you're
1740120	1741440	into games, huh?
1741440	1747840	Well, instead of having a normal judge, we're going to bring in the brown eye of judgment
1747840	1751560	and then it will decide if it's going to shit on the kid or not.
1751560	1752560	That'd be great.
1752560	1753560	You know what?
1753560	1754560	No, it's kind of interesting.
1754560	1759720	I'm surprised they haven't sued Nintendo over the Game Boy Advance because the desire for
1759720	1764800	the console made him punch a cop because I'm sure that's what they're going to, you know-
1764800	1767940	You know, there's a story that didn't get on our show roll tonight that I want to say
1767940	1771720	Rob Way sent to our mailbox, and sorry about that, buddy, we just, um, I forgot to put
1771720	1773760	it on there, but I'll mention it now.
1773760	1777440	Something about, speaking of cops, that cops were using their badges to cut to the front
1777440	1778440	of the PlayStation 3 line.
1778440	1779440	Did you hear about that?
1779440	1780440	Yeah.
1780440	1781440	They were, like, using their authority-
1781440	1782440	I'm not surprised.
1782440	1783440	Respect my authority!
1783440	1784440	And then give me a PlayStation 3.
1784440	1786080	Yeah, they did that with the 360, too.
1786080	1788280	A security guard did the same thing with the 360.
1788280	1789280	It's kind of messed up.
1789280	1790280	Yeah.
1790280	1791280	Gotta have it.
1791280	1792280	Anyways.
1792280	1794400	That's why the kid punched the cop.
1794400	1795400	Definitely.
1795400	1798360	BIPORG99 in our chat says, who buys Game Boy Advance anymore?
1798360	1800360	Get a DS instead.
1800360	1801360	True.
1801360	1802360	No one buys Game Boy Advance.
1802360	1805240	I haven't sold one in ages.
1805240	1806240	Anywho.
1806240	1812760	So, now there's a brand new campaign that's being launched by GameStop, among other people,
1812760	1817920	to kind of educate parents on the ESRB rating system.
1817920	1819160	Don't copy that floppy!
1819160	1822040	Oh, sorry, the ratings.
1822040	1824320	Rating systems, not copying games.
1824320	1825320	Anyways.
1825320	1832360	So, they've launched a brand new website called respecttheradings.com, and it's basically
1832360	1839520	talking about what the ratings mean, and how you can enforce them better with your kids.
1839520	1843480	Basically talking about the different genres of games and stuff.
1843480	1850040	Also having a bit of- they have some actual terminology on here, which is great, because
1850040	1857480	they actually define frag, defeating an opponent in a first or third person shooter game.
1857480	1864520	Like giblets, tiny pieces of what's left of the character when they meet an unfortunate
1864520	1865520	end.
1865520	1872280	Giblets sounds like something your brown eye of judgement leaves on the camera.
1872280	1875000	Just talking about different things.
1875000	1876000	It's interesting.
1876000	1885120	I guess a good tool for parents, to be honest, no matter how many websites like this, and
1885120	1890600	how many posters, and how many people across the counter tell you about the rating system.
1890600	1894680	You're still going to have a mom calling her cops on the kid because she can't keep a Christmas
1894680	1895680	present under wraps.
1895680	1900360	And you're still going to have fucking people suing game companies because their kid committed
1900360	1904080	a crime and they found little Billy had a mature rating game.
1904080	1905920	I had no idea what the M meant.
1905920	1909840	I thought it meant it was good.
1909840	1915600	M for mom with the tattoo.
1915600	1916600	This is interesting.
1916600	1917600	Going back to the last story a little bit.
1917600	1921760	Rama in our chat room says, Jimmy Kimmel had him and his mom on the show last week and
1921760	1927680	gave the kid the entire OZ DVD collection as a reminder of what happens in jail.
1927680	1931480	Do not parade this child on your talk show.
1931480	1932880	He's supposed to be punished.
1932880	1936240	Dude, he punched a cop.
1936240	1938160	I don't care if the cop punched him first.
1938160	1939200	You don't do that.
1939200	1942240	It's not like he just stole the damn thing from under the tree.
1942240	1948760	I mean, they're having him and his mom on television going like, oh, ha ha ha, it's just
1948760	1953080	a big misunderstanding, wah wah wah wah, we're one big happy dysfunctional family.
1953080	1957120	He's probably like on there, man, if I knew it was going to be this famous, I would have
1957120	1958880	stabbed the bitch in the vagina.
1958880	1959880	Exactly.
1959880	1963680	I'm just encouraging him to do it again and worse, because what's going to happen when
1963680	1966080	this kid's 15 minutes of fame runs out this time?
1966080	1968600	In fact, I'm done talking about him.
1968600	1970440	I don't want to talk about this kid anymore.
1970440	1975360	I'm glad I didn't say his name.
1975360	1979200	So yeah, respect the ratings, bitch.
1979200	1980520	That's what GameStop says.
1980520	1983840	And Activision also is hoping folks respect the ratings.
1983840	1987240	They're actually surveying parents on the ESRB.
1987240	1992560	They found that an overwhelming 84% of parents were familiar with the ESRB rating system.
1992560	1998280	79% of them say they pay close attention to the ratings of games their children play.
1998280	1999280	Very interesting.
1999280	2005340	Now, you know, also 80.4% of all statistics are made up on the spot, I suppose, but they
2005340	2011400	do say that in this survey, 1,014 online interviews were conducted among a nationally representative
2011400	2016480	group of video game players aged 88 to 24 and their parents.
2016480	2019680	They did this over a week from a Harrison group, who I've heard of before.
2019680	2024040	They're a pretty respectable surveying group.
2024040	2025040	So interesting.
2025040	2026040	Well, great.
2026040	2028760	Well, there were some interesting guides.
2028760	2034240	I know one of them was posted on Engadget this week talking about what you need, because
2034240	2039540	definitely one of the big gifts this holiday season is HGTVs, especially with game systems
2039540	2046080	out there, a lot of them requiring high def for better graphics and stuff.
2046080	2048040	You're going to need an HGTV at some point.
2048040	2049480	It's time to go with the times.
2049480	2056600	So there's a wonderful little guide, and actually this was done by A&E Interactive, part of
2056600	2064820	Mercury News, and they've got a guide to what gamers need to know when buying an HGTV.
2064820	2070040	And they go through everything from the basics, including what the different things mean,
2070040	2077520	including 480p, what the progressive versus interlaced means.
2077520	2083940	Very interesting stuff, including comparisons between flat panel or rear projection, etc.
2083940	2088120	And personally, the other thing, I don't know if it was mentioned on here, but another thing
2088120	2092880	you might want to check also when looking into a TV is websites like IGN, for example,
2092880	2098980	were running lists of HGTVs and possible lag on these TVs.
2098980	2101660	So you want to check into lag, definitely.
2101660	2108960	Also price-wise, you want to make sure that your TV is going to be putting out the right
2108960	2113600	resolution for you, whether you want to sell at 720p or you want to spend the money and
2113600	2114600	get 1080p.
2114600	2120080	And really, unless you have a really large TV, you're not going to really notice the
2120080	2123560	difference between 1080p and probably 1080i.
2123560	2129160	You know what they're really considering though, is it cheap?
2129160	2132700	Because most of these guys are what, like college kids that are trying to pool together
2132700	2137820	the money they've got to buy a good TV, so they're just going to buy something cheap.
2137820	2144960	If I were our listeners, what I would do is, and this is how I bought my TV, shopping around
2144960	2150400	I actually found Newegg.com was pretty cheap, they had a lot of refurbished TVs.
2150400	2156720	And you can buy refurbished TV, maybe it's last year's model or earlier this year, whatever,
2156720	2158760	but it's still pretty good for the price.
2158760	2167600	And I got a 37-inch TV, does upwards to 1080i, actually has built-in VGA, DVI, et cetera,
2167600	2168920	for about $800.
2168920	2170440	And it wasn't that bad.
2170440	2171860	And they're only going to come down in price.
2171860	2175860	And probably if you shop right after Christmas, I think you're going to get a lot of deals
2175860	2177120	that way too.
2177120	2178120	Here's how I got mine.
2178120	2182920	About a year ago, I bought an HDTV at Costco for about $600.
2182920	2186800	And that was a 30-inch widescreen, now it was a CRT, so I had a big back and some things
2186800	2188460	were a little bit blurry on it.
2188460	2192800	But here's the thing, that thing broke after like a year, but since I bought it from Costco,
2192800	2194000	they'll take it back.
2194000	2196760	So I took it because I still had the receipt, I held onto that baby.
2196760	2201280	So I took it back to the Costco, they took it back, and for about $100 more, I got an
2201280	2205720	upgrade to a flat 32-inch widescreen TV that's pretty awesome.
2205720	2209360	Costco's an in-house brand, but you know what, it works great for what I need.
2209360	2215200	And the one I bought, it's I don't think really a name brand, but it's just fine.
2215200	2221320	Really when you're buying a lot of these TVs, they're Sony or Toshiba or whatever, you're
2221320	2227120	buying it based off a brand, and brand names sometimes run a lot more expensive than they
2227120	2228120	really need to.
2228120	2237080	So just read the reviews online, compare pricing, compare features, definitely read any feedback
2237080	2241840	people have left about certain TVs and stuff, what issues you may run into.
2241840	2245800	Like mine, going into it, I knew it had a crappy TV remote, and when I bought it, yeah,
2245800	2250800	it has a really crappy TV remote that sucks balls, but that's the only thing that's really
2250800	2255720	bad about it, and that can be fixed if I really want to with a universal remote.
2255720	2259240	And I'm just too lazy and I don't care, so it'll work just fine.
2259240	2260760	But that's about it.
2260760	2266440	So just really do your research and score a pretty good HDTV.
2266440	2271200	Or if you're really cheap, just fucking buy the VGA cables for whatever system you want
2271200	2274760	to play it on, and just play it on your TV or your computer monitor.
2274760	2281200	That's what I did with my 360 before I had an HDTV, and it works just good, so interesting.
2281200	2283640	All right, well we're going to get into the mailbag, but first we're going to go to our
2283640	2288120	voicemail of the week, and if you want to leave us a voicemail, you can always give
2288120	2292440	us a call after show hours to 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2292440	2294940	That's a toll-free number in the US and Canada.
2294940	2299360	Get this, here is our voicemail of the week that somebody left.
2299360	2303480	I love you guys!
2303480	2304480	That's it.
2304480	2309480	Well, we love you too, but next time leave your name.
2309480	2312840	Needless to say, we have not been getting many voicemails of the week, so we are encouraging
2312840	2319320	you guys to leave your thoughts on the program in audio format by giving us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2319320	2322400	Thanks to the anonymous listener who was spreading the love there, though, we appreciate it.
2322400	2323840	It inflates our egos.
2323840	2324920	We like that.
2324920	2328880	Let's get into our mailbag, boys and girls, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
2328880	2339080	Of course, Dark Sakura is not here this week, which means I'm going to be reading the mail,
2339080	2340680	so deal.
2340680	2343200	Next email comes to us from ureelover tonight.
2343200	2346280	Dear OLR, you guys suck!
2346280	2347280	And sarcasm.
2347280	2349360	He was just teasing because we said we didn't get enough hate mail.
2349360	2352840	Anyway, I remember listening to one of the podcasts a few weeks ago, and I forgot to
2352840	2353960	email you guys about it.
2353960	2357040	It was during the Wii launch, and some people were playing Risk at the front of the waiting
2357040	2359240	line, just like the old gamers back in the day do.
2359240	2363960	And I was just wondering, what bored tabletop games would you like to see in the Xbox 360
2363960	2367160	Marketplace Wii Connect PlayStation 3 online service?
2367160	2370320	I personally would like to see a couple things, first being Risk.
2370320	2374160	I would love to be able to say to the other people, I have Australia, bitches!
2374160	2376720	Or eat that, com shtaka!
2376720	2379920	Another one would be Monopoly, just seeing people's faces when they land on Park Place
2379920	2382240	with a hotel, and if they'd have to pay up.
2382240	2384720	The last one would be Candyland.
2384720	2388400	Don't know why, but I bet it would be Microsoft's new Gears of War or Halo 3.
2388400	2389400	Definitely.
2389400	2391560	Keep up the good work, and reject false icons.
2391560	2393100	Thank you, ureelover.
2393100	2396680	So what bored games would you like to see on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox Live?
2396680	2397680	What do you think?
2397680	2401360	I'd like to see a second Monopoly, that might be fun, especially with the Xbox Live Vision
2401360	2402360	camera.
2402360	2405800	Because then you can dress up like Mr. Moneybags.
2405800	2407720	And I'm trying to think, actually...
2407720	2411240	Well you know you're getting Settlers of Catan in some of the British games, which
2411240	2412240	is kind of cool.
2412240	2414600	They're also doing Checkers and Chess, I think, at some point too.
2414600	2418360	I remember that was with the Vision camera.
2418360	2421440	Battleship might be pretty fun.
2421440	2425120	You know, actually, it'd be kind of cool to see some other, like...
2425120	2428320	I have one, I have one, Clue.
2428320	2429320	Clue would be fun.
2429320	2430320	Clue would be awesome.
2430320	2434840	And I don't want regular Clue, I want Clue Master Detective.
2434840	2438000	Or how about if you could, like, patch your, like, they could, see, you know what Xbox
2438000	2439000	could do?
2439000	2443400	Is that they could charge you then, like, you know, 80 points to download, you know,
2443400	2447040	The Simpsons Clue, and, you know, what other Clue games they've done.
2447040	2451180	All the licensed versions of Clue that they have, and, you know, Cameo Clue, and Project
2451180	2453520	Gotham Racing Clue.
2453520	2456080	I think it was the Ford.
2456080	2460360	It was the Ford in the Indy Raceway with the carbon monoxide.
2460360	2463520	Okay, maybe that's kind of lame, I don't know.
2463520	2466320	Next email comes to us from DDR Dollar Bill.
2466320	2471000	Hi, my name is Bill, though some of the DDR players from New York City and New Jersey
2471000	2472840	know me as Dollar Bill.
2472840	2477300	I used to freestyle on DDR a lot since 2001 and still do, though not as much anymore.
2477300	2480880	I did compete this year at Digital Life, though it was all improv and not meant to be taken
2480880	2481880	seriously.
2481880	2483680	I was the best, but I certainly was not the worst either.
2483680	2488640	The times I've had were wonderful, and I made some great stories of going to various tournaments.
2488640	2491920	There's a few videos of me floating around, some good, some not so good.
2491920	2494960	Seems that if it was good, it was good, and if it was bad, it was, well, let's not go
2494960	2495960	there.
2495960	2500880	Before I get into it, I do wonder if I'm one of the older listeners out there at age 31.
2500880	2505120	I know for a fact we do have some listeners above the age of 31, and in fact, you know,
2505120	2511440	our own Dark Sakura is 30, and I'm 28, so not too far away, and Loki, you're what, 26?
2511440	2516480	We're not that far away.
2516480	2520280	Bill goes on to say, I just wanted to say that the entire cast does a great job in every
2520280	2521280	broadcast.
2521280	2524280	I started listening to the podcast mainly once after I got a working iPod after going
2524280	2527440	through about four of them and a creative Zen that went emo and killed itself after
2527440	2530240	playing the theme song for Evangelion.
2530240	2534320	I always look forward to each podcast, though I do enjoy your live show more.
2534320	2537960	There's times I can't make Sunday nights due to other things going on.
2537960	2541560	What I do enjoy about each show is the fresh insight into gaming, not the standard garbage
2541560	2545720	that some game magazine's websites tend to publish, but rather one from every man's,
2545720	2549120	and woman, I haven't forgot about you, Jamie, especially since you're also a Whovian, point
2549120	2550120	of view.
2550120	2553200	I recently have classified myself more as a casual gamer of late, not having the time
2553200	2557680	to play every game out there, nor the finances to purchase every hot new game release, so
2557680	2561140	I need to be more selective in what I picked up, and I've tended to agree with pretty much
2561140	2564760	of most of what has been recommended, Elite Beat Agents, Luminous for the Mobile, or two
2564760	2569840	examples I can think of right away, plunking $40 to $60 per game only to come up disappointed,
2569840	2574560	and being only able to get the most half of my money back is not a good way to keep a
2574560	2575560	living.
2575560	2578520	I best end this letter before the chat room explodes with people saying to shut the fuck
2578520	2579520	up and so forth.
2579520	2581280	In conclusion, great show, guys.
2581280	2583920	Keep up the work, and see you on the chat rooms whenever I can.
2583920	2585520	That was a very nice email.
2585520	2586520	Thank you.
2586520	2587520	I thought there was a question in it.
2587520	2590460	Well, I thought there was a question here somewhere, but I guess the older listeners'
2590460	2592600	part was the question, but that's all right.
2592600	2597080	We appreciate a nice fuzzy email once in a while that makes us feel good about what we
2597080	2598840	do and not getting paid for it.
2598840	2599840	We appreciate it.
2599840	2600840	You guys are awesome.
2600840	2602640	Yeah, I'm going to be honest.
2602640	2606200	A lot of gaming mags and online publications, we've seen it firsthand.
2606200	2610580	We've heard them talking at the various press events, and what they do is they rehash the
2610580	2614760	press releases that they're given and turn it into an exclusive, so that's what your
2614760	2620800	money's going for usually when you're paying for those subscriptions and things.
2620800	2624440	We on the other hand actually like to play the games before we say anything about it,
2624440	2627080	or we try to as much as we can.
2627080	2629400	Next email comes to us from Ricky.
2629400	2633520	As we upgrade our gaming hardware, we must at some point upgrade our televisions.
2633520	2637400	To achieve the best display of your next gen system, you must have a really expensive TV.
2637400	2638680	This kind of goes into your last story.
2638680	2641900	This is what your average consumer will be slapped in the face with once they purchase
2641900	2645840	a system and realize that there is only a marginal difference from old gen to new gen.
2645840	2649960	The only people I know that can discern the differences and meanings of the whole 720i,
2649960	2653920	1080p thing are the people that talk with the best buyer rep as they are persuaded to
2653920	2656160	buy a wallet melting television.
2656160	2659960	In the future, do you think that there will be a particular method of getting the word
2659960	2664520	out about HD resolutions in the mainstream media, making the info about HD available
2664520	2666200	to everyone so they can upgrade too?
2666200	2667560	Your thoughts?
2667560	2672800	I'm sure they're going to have, well they already have kind of, not really public service
2672800	2675400	stuff, but they have info.
2675400	2678880	I think unfortunately what you see now is what you're going to get.
2678880	2683520	I think since it is best buying those types of places selling the TVs, it is going to
2683520	2688400	be those folks selling them, obviously trying to sell the most expensive ones and the replacement
2688400	2693480	plans or whatever, that are going to unfortunately be all there is for most people.
2693480	2697920	I don't exactly see them running commercials on TV.
2697920	2704160	Maybe in 2007, as I think especially next Christmas, HD TVs are going to be a big, big
2704160	2705160	deal.
2705160	2706960	I mean they already are a little bit this Christmas, but next Christmas especially,
2706960	2710800	I think they're going to be even more affordable, but I don't think you're going to see a lot
2710800	2715040	of, the brochures and things you're going to see are going to be a best buy.
2715040	2716960	Circuit City, the place is selling the TVs.
2716960	2721240	I don't exactly see there being a big public knowledge campaign.
2721240	2725360	In the end, people are going to look at what's up on the wall and what's showing on the screen
2725360	2728000	and they're going to go, which one's pretty?
2728000	2732000	So if a gamer, it's tough for a gamer because they don't show a lot of video games on those
2732000	2733000	things.
2733000	2738400	So it's hard to choose when you're a gamer what type of TV will look best for your games.
2738400	2742220	You kind of have to base it off whatever in-store feed they have running.
2742220	2745640	So it makes the choice a little more difficult.
2745640	2746640	We'll see though.
2746640	2747640	We could be proven wrong.
2747640	2748640	Who knows?
2748640	2749640	Who knows what they'll do.
2749640	2750640	All right.
2750640	2752680	Let's go to the next email, which comes to us from Nim.
2752680	2754520	Hey guys, how's it going?
2754520	2757320	I haven't been able to listen to your show for a couple of weeks, seeing as I finally
2757320	2759920	got my hands on BeatMania 2DX and a new girlfriend.
2759920	2762000	Hey, keep your hands off her.
2762000	2763160	You may not appreciate that.
2763160	2764400	No, I'm kidding.
2764400	2765400	If you ask, it's okay.
2765400	2766960	But that's besides the point.
2766960	2770780	Okay, I feel like touching on a few subjects at hand since I listened to your last podcast.
2770780	2774520	First of all, I'm not sure I quote unquote hate Sony, but I don't think I'm going to
2774520	2778680	even get a PS3 until they start releasing some better games or some I've heard rumors
2778680	2783220	about such as Final Fantasy 7 or they start releasing BeatMania 2DX on it.
2783220	2786680	The war with me is probably going to be with Microsoft and Nintendo here.
2786680	2790720	The games already released for the 360 look great and I want them badly.
2790720	2794120	Kind of along the same lines with the Wii, but I'm going to be waiting to get that
2794120	2796960	because I've been dying to play Brawl since I've heard about it.
2796960	2798600	What are some of the rumors you've heard about it?
2798600	2801600	I've heard there were supposedly over 100 characters supposed to be in it.
2801600	2803280	I highly doubt that, sorry.
2803280	2807080	Thanks guys, I'll be tuning in hopefully tonight or I'll get your podcast tomorrow.
2807080	2810200	That comes from Nim.
2810200	2811200	You know what's interesting though?
2811200	2815280	You say that the real war is between Microsoft and Nintendo, but I actually disagree because
2815280	2820200	if Microsoft and Nintendo can pull enough of the share away from Sony, then they could
2820200	2822720	both effectively claim victory in here.
2822720	2826120	Let's face it, they were not number one the last time around, so either one of them comes
2826120	2831880	up on top or even goes from number two to number, let's say Nintendo goes from number
2831880	2836440	three to number two, they're going to be sitting pretty.
2836440	2840440	Some speculate Nintendo is going to go from number three all the way to number one this
2840440	2841440	time.
2841440	2842440	Again, speculation.
2842440	2848000	I'm an analyst, and Xbox 360 is going to stay at number two, but it's going to be
2848000	2858400	a bigger number two than it was the last time around for them, so if they can take more
2858400	2863680	of Sony's share, then they both can effectively win, you know what I mean?
2863680	2867480	Any thoughts from you, Loki, on this?
2867480	2874640	Of course, Microsoft say both them and Nintendo take the large share away from Sony.
2874640	2879240	I'm sure they're not going to settle for number two, so you know, there will be a clear winner
2879240	2885240	I think, but I don't know, I think the 360 is doing pretty good so far where they have
2885240	2892440	kind of something for everybody, although the only casual games I've seen so far, mainly
2892440	2898400	just on Xbox Live Arcade and even, well I guess Viva Pinata would be a casual game,
2898400	2899400	but it sucks.
2899400	2903560	I didn't think it was that bad, it's just different.
2903560	2906760	It's not what you think it is, it's not for kids either, I didn't think a kid could
2906760	2909920	get into that game, but anyway, that's beside the point.
2909920	2912540	You know what else is interesting about this time around is I really think it's going
2912540	2914320	to be different region to region.
2914320	2917880	I think the UK is fucking pissed at Sony and they're probably not going to forgive them
2917880	2921880	for it anytime soon, I don't see Sony doing very well there, but I see it doing better
2921880	2922880	in Japan.
2922880	2927320	I don't think the 360 is going to come out from third place in Japan anytime soon.
2927320	2932000	Yes, you had Blue Dragon launch recently and yes, we all saw the people camped out in line,
2932000	2936880	but they need more of that and they need it soon before the Playstation 3 starts delivering
2936880	2939800	on that or they're going to be screwed.
2939800	2944320	I think if Xbox really steps it up and puts out some quality stuff along the lines of
2944320	2948760	those Blue Dragon type things, and it looks like we have the game based on Chopin, what
2948760	2952960	was that game called, the Tumble Bell or something Bell?
2952960	2953960	Trusty Bell.
2953960	2954960	Trusty Bell, thank you, that's coming out.
2954960	2960240	Some of the other games, maybe they're going in the right direction, but Microsoft needs
2960240	2963560	to pick it up a little bit or else they're going to get their butt whipped by Sony, at
2963560	2964560	least in Japan.
2964560	2970000	But I think that's going to be interesting having different rankings throughout the world.
2970000	2974800	That's what's going to make this generation of consoles different, in my opinion, and
2974800	2977960	will ultimately affect the next generation of gaming.
2977960	2980360	Lastly, a quick email.
2980360	2986040	It wasn't signed with a handle, so we'll call him Nick S. Nick S. sent us an email.
2986040	2989160	Hello, first I would like to compliment you on your podcast, I've been listening for a
2989160	2990360	few months and love it.
2990360	2991360	Thank you, appreciate it.
2991360	2995360	I was wondering what you thought about Gears of War, because I would like to get OLR's
2995360	2996360	opinions.
2996360	3000200	PS, every time I'm holding my PSP, I'm always listening to you, OLR, you're all the best
3000200	3001200	gamers I know.
3001200	3003200	That's very sweet, thank you.
3003200	3008160	Gears of War, you know, I thought I talked about this on the show a little bit previously,
3008160	3009900	but I'll say it again.
3009900	3017040	It's a pretty game, and it's a kick-ass co-op game, but it didn't really click for me.
3017040	3020920	I'm not feeling all the praise that everybody else is lavishing upon it.
3020920	3025440	It wasn't ultimately very much fun for me, and I got frustrated with the controls.
3025440	3029960	I felt like I wasn't really understanding what I was doing throughout a lot of the game,
3029960	3033240	and it's not like I haven't played first-person shooters before, okay, I've played Halo, I
3033240	3038480	beat Prey, you know, well of course any idiot can beat Prey, but you know, it just really
3038480	3040120	wasn't my kind of game.
3040120	3045240	But I've always been more into music games, action games, you know, first-person shooters
3045240	3051440	have usually been a little lower on what I like, but I didn't enjoy Gears of War as much
3051440	3056800	as even frickin' Prey I thought was more fun to play for me, and you know, but maybe that's
3056800	3060400	because Gears of War isn't quite the same traditional shooter, either.
3060400	3064640	You know, it's cover, shoot, cover, shoot, and a lot of the game has to do with covering,
3064640	3068560	and maybe I'm just more into the, you know, kamikaze type of playing.
3068560	3069560	Leeward Jenkins!
3069560	3071640	I'm that guy, you know?
3071640	3075560	Well, I wasn't really into the game either, but then again I haven't really played it
3075560	3083160	enough to give a fair shake yet, but my coworker just finally got a 360, and he bought actually
3083160	3087760	Gears of War as well, and he said that he hasn't been able to pass the first tutorial
3087760	3091960	stage yet, he says it's fuckin' hard, and he's playing on the simplest difficulty, and
3091960	3095080	he plays a lot of first-person shooters.
3095080	3098600	It's not EDI, that even like held me up for a little bit too, I finally got out of the
3098600	3102620	stupid tutorial level, but I, you know, the first, it's just, I don't know.
3102620	3105600	Of course, I haven't, now admittedly I have not played enough of the co-op.
3105600	3109440	I think that's my biggest problem, because that's where most people seem to be lovin'
3109440	3113320	Gears of War, is co-op, and you know, I'll give it that, you know, I'll trust my friends'
3113320	3117420	assessments on that, and hopefully I'll get some friends someday, and I can play Gears
3117420	3118420	of War co-op.
3118420	3119420	That'll be fun.
3119420	3122580	If I can tear myself away from burnout this week, we'll see.
3122580	3123580	That's it for the mailbag!
3123580	3127480	If you want to send some emails, we'd love to hear from you, and sorry, you know, we
3127480	3131240	weren't able to read every email we got this week on the air, but DarkSakura does make
3131240	3134640	an effort to always read all the email, and you know, when she's out, I'll step in and
3134640	3136120	try to read and respond to the email.
3136120	3139600	We'd love to hear from you guys, and it really keeps us going here at Orange Lontredo, so
3139600	3140600	we appreciate it.
3140600	3141600	Thanks, you guys.
3141600	3142600	Back to the news.
3142600	3150440	Anyway, so, I swear to God, I've had so many co-workers come up to me and go, hey, have
3150440	3156680	you heard about those crazy Wii straps breaking, and people breaking their TVs with the Wii
3156680	3157680	Mode?
3157680	3158680	And all this...
3158680	3167160	I mean, it's like ridiculous how much this has been spun out of proportion, just... it's
3167160	3172160	idiots basically throwing the Wii Mode, you know, at 90 miles an hour, and going, why
3172160	3175120	did it break and smash my TV?
3175120	3178880	Maybe because you're trying to throw a real 90 mile an hour fastball in baseball when
3178880	3183520	you really don't have to, and it says in the manual, you know, make the movement slightly.
3183520	3186040	You don't have to, you know, do it really hard.
3186040	3193760	Anyways, that being said, Nintendo has actually gone ahead and fixed the straps.
3193760	3199720	They're a lot thicker now, and you can actually find them starting with the Australia launch,
3199720	3201960	and in the Wii Play bundle.
3201960	3207200	They have new straps, and if you really want to, if you've broken your straps, you can
3207200	3209880	probably buy them on the Nintendo store.
3209880	3215440	And so, yeah, the new remotes are going to have new straps that will be...
3215440	3217600	All it is is kind of just a knot tied around the controller.
3217600	3222080	Couldn't you just get your own little, you know, steel cable type thing that won't hurt
3222080	3223080	your hand?
3223080	3226120	People have been using fishing line, and just basically have done it that way.
3226120	3227760	That sounds like it would hurt, though.
3227760	3229880	You know, because remember, this stuff's going to press up against your wrist.
3229880	3230880	You don't want anything that's too...
3230880	3236560	No, replacing the little string that goes from the actual strap to fishing line, so
3236560	3239560	I'm...
3239560	3240560	Personally just don't...
3240560	3242040	Do that crap at your own risk, though.
3242040	3243040	Exactly.
3243040	3244040	Or don't throw the damn remote.
3244040	3246520	I mean, seriously, if you're going to...
3246520	3247520	Don't let go of it.
3247520	3249200	You're not supposed to let go of it.
3249200	3254400	They've got, you know, covers in case, you know, your hands get sweaty, like...
3254400	3258040	My hands have never gotten that sweaty, I mean, and shit, I...
3258040	3261040	Right before I'm playing the Wii or something, I'm eating, you know, fucking fast food, and
3261040	3264960	my hands are all greasy from french fries, so if that shit doesn't make the, you know,
3264960	3267800	the Wii remote fly out of my hands, then nothing will.
3267800	3274800	So if you're really that clumsy and are prone to throwing shit through windows and TVs,
3274800	3279960	then maybe you shouldn't, I don't know, buy a Wii, or maybe you should duct tape that
3279960	3282040	shit to your arm, I don't know.
3282040	3285560	Jeremy Todd, one in our chat room, says a friend bought four new straps on Nintendo's
3285560	3289080	website for $6.24 including shipping.
3289080	3291960	Chat dot orange launch radio dot com if you want to leave your own comments.
3291960	3295320	If you're listening live here on Sunday night, which we tape live 6pm at orange launch radio
3295320	3298220	dot com every week.
3298220	3301400	By the way, component cables in stock on their wrist.
3301400	3305080	I just ordered from Nintendo as well, and I haven't checked the tracking of them, the
3305080	3307840	last I checked they were in Portland, so I should be getting them next week.
3307840	3308840	Very excited.
3308840	3309840	Mine coming Monday.
3309840	3310840	Very excited.
3310840	3311840	Then I'm going to play more Zelda.
3311840	3314160	I've kind of held off from Zelda because I won't play it until it's as pretty as it's
3314160	3315160	going to get.
3315160	3317240	I'm stupid like that, don't listen to me.
3317240	3320820	Black Wolf comments, Nintendo investigating the wrist traps means that they admit there
3320820	3323880	is a problem which will open themselves up to lawsuits.
3323880	3327560	Rama counters, I doubt it though, Nintendo said not to be rough with it.
3327560	3328560	They did send out an email.
3328560	3331120	Did you get the email from Nintendo this week?
3331120	3335200	I got an email from Nintendo that was posted, bloggers got it too, and it was posted all
3335200	3338520	over and it said, we hope you're enjoying the Wii, but be careful with it.
3338520	3344680	I didn't get the email, but here, come on, really though, it says like 50,000 times when
3344680	3348800	you're playing Wii Sports, make sure the wrist strap is securely fastened.
3348800	3350660	Shouldn't you be taking a break?
3350660	3353000	Make sure you're not swinging this around wildly.
3353000	3354160	Be careful of others.
3354160	3358040	I think they have done everything in their power to make sure that you do not throw that.
3358040	3362360	If you're just a fucking idiot and want to go ahead and throw your damn remote, you're
3362360	3363560	the only one to blame.
3363560	3369400	Do not fucking try to sue Nintendo because you were dumb and decided, oh, I'm going to
3369400	3373520	let go of the remote while I'm bullying and it went through your goddamn TV.
3373520	3379160	I mean, seriously, if you're that stupid, and I imagine there will be someone that sues
3379160	3383040	I didn't know it would fly out of my hand, I thought this tiny piece of string would
3383040	3384720	keep it from anything.
3384720	3390240	I thought I could swing it around like a goddamn lasso.
3390240	3392280	People are so goddamn retarded.
3392280	3397360	Okay, I'm just going to, devil's advocate, do the games encourage this behavior?
3397360	3402440	No, I don't think they do because they show you, even like for example Rayman's Raving
3402440	3407660	Rabbids, when they're showing you how to play it, they show you, you know, holding the remote,
3407660	3409680	they don't show you wildly swinging around.
3409680	3412340	They show you just kind of making small little movements.
3412340	3417520	The wrist strap is around the goddamn bunny's hand, so it is encouraging the proper use
3417520	3418520	of this.
3418520	3422480	And nowhere does it say in the game to swing as fast as possible.
3422480	3426980	It says in the Wii Sports manual, and I know no one reads the manual anymore, but it says
3426980	3430160	it in there to, you know, swing lightly.
3430160	3434440	You know, you do not need to do, you do not need to swing it wildly.
3434440	3436560	I don't know what more they could possibly do.
3436560	3439920	I mean, Wii Sports seems to be the one that's been the biggest culprit.
3439920	3443340	You know, baseball, because people are trying to throw a fastball, because you don't exactly
3443340	3447600	throw pitches in Zelda, you know, and that's the other huge game right now.
3447600	3452440	So it's basically that game, and it's just people don't get it.
3452440	3455560	They don't get that you're not actually playing the real thing.
3455560	3460360	You don't need to throw, I mean, and granted when I was playing baseball, you know, I was
3460360	3465440	trying to, you know, throw it hard, but you realize after a little bit, you're all, wait,
3465440	3466440	I don't need to do that.
3466440	3469880	I can just kind of flick my wrist, and it does the same thing.
3469880	3473200	So it's just stupid people.
3473200	3474480	Alright, well, speaking of...
3474480	3475480	Ruining it for everyone.
3475480	3479880	Speaking of stupid, you'd be awfully stupid to buy point cards from Toys R Us, at least
3479880	3484800	the ones that have been marking up their 2,000 point cards to $24.99.
3484800	3486320	That's what they're charging on the internet as well.
3486320	3492680	Now keep in mind, 2,000 Wii points, you can buy on your Wii for 20 bucks.
3492680	3495840	So you'd be kind of dumb to buy this from Toys R Us.
3495840	3500240	Now Mieklatov, he had to leave the show because he had a pretty bad headache, but I know he
3500240	3503680	wanted to point out that they were at Best Buy or Target something earlier, and they
3503680	3505040	saw the same thing going on there.
3505040	3509580	So this isn't just Toys R Us, it's just people have caught Toys R Us because it's online.
3509580	3514280	So a lot of folks are selling these things online for more money.
3514280	3520160	And you know what's actually kind of interesting though, I remember originally when we had
3520160	3525880	our, when we were adding the SKUs for the Wii stuff before launch, the Wii point cards
3525880	3526880	were $24, $25.
3526880	3530200	And I was like, what the fuck, that doesn't make any sense because they're supposed to
3530200	3535560	be, you know, it's a dollar for every point, or a penny for every point basically.
3535560	3539560	And I wouldn't be surprised because the margin, as I mentioned on other shows, the margin
3539560	3545480	of Nintendo products right now because they're trying to make an extreme profit on this stuff
3545480	3546480	is nothing.
3546480	3553480	I mean, the price that Best Buy probably pays for this stuff is like $16, and they're making
3553480	3556960	only $4 off of this thing.
3556960	3558640	Or it might even be even less than that.
3558640	3564960	I think it's really like $2 is what they're making off of this stuff, and even less on
3564960	3566700	controllers and other stuff.
3566700	3571200	So the fact that they're charging more, you know, granted, yeah, that's not very good,
3571200	3575360	but the average mom and pop that are buying these things, they don't know how much they're
3575360	3577720	supposed to cost, and they're going to pay that price.
3577720	3581200	Do you think Costco would be selling these even cheaper?
3581200	3585880	Because Costco's notorious for selling things very, very little above cost.
3585880	3590380	Do you think you could possibly get a $19 card at Costco?
3590380	3593640	You might be able to, I'm not sure though, it depends.
3593640	3598440	Because if their margins are that small, they might not sell it at a loss, or that little.
3598440	3601720	I mean, they might just sell it at the normal price.
3601720	3606320	But I'm not surprised, though, that you're seeing people charging $24 for these things.
3606320	3612240	It's just the same reason why you see mad cats charging $60 for fucking component cables,
3612240	3616720	when I can buy React's component cables for $19.99.
3616720	3621020	Or fuck, they have official Nintendo ones for like $29.99.
3621020	3622920	So they're just paying off people who don't know any better?
3622920	3627920	Yeah, they're paying off people that are buying these stuff as a gift for their kids, or for
3627920	3631080	Christmas, and they don't know how much this is supposed to cost.
3631080	3635600	And I guess their excuse would be, it's a convenience for our customers, because little
3635600	3637920	Bobby does not have a credit card.
3637920	3638920	So we're...
3638920	3642320	And to be honest, I think it's a rip-off to buy them at retail anyways, because you're
3642320	3644120	paying tax on $20.
3644120	3645120	So just buy it online.
3645120	3649280	Well, no, the weird thing is, I could have sworn I saw the Wii in some places was charging
3649280	3650280	tax.
3650280	3653040	Like I saw a screenshot where somebody was being charged tax on the points, but I'm not
3653040	3655060	charged tax here.
3655060	3657900	It says you can, there's a tax thing on there.
3657900	3662320	I'm not sure if it's for that per se, but there's a little tax thing on there where
3662320	3664480	you could be charged tax.
3664480	3667800	It's like a little spot for it, but so far they're not.
3667800	3670480	Maybe they're only taxing if you live in Washington, since that's where they're based?
3670480	3671480	I don't know.
3671480	3673680	I don't think so, it's...
3673680	3674680	I don't know.
3674680	3675680	No idea.
3675680	3679320	I could swear I saw a YouTube video where someone was being charged tax.
3679320	3680320	I don't know.
3680320	3683640	Because I remember commenting, oh that sucks, Xbox doesn't charge you tax.
3683640	3686760	Like I remember commenting on that, and I was kind of mad at Nintendo, but then when
3686760	3690600	I actually went to buy the points, I was not charged.
3690600	3691600	I'm stealing a fry.
3691600	3693480	If you're going to bring food in here, I'm stealing a fry.
3693480	3694480	It's popcorn shrimp.
3694480	3698400	Well, I'm still stealing a fry that comes with the shrimp.
3698400	3700960	Anyway.
3700960	3703560	Moving on, while I chow down here.
3703560	3709560	So speaking of Nintendo, not a huge surprise.
3709560	3713280	They were a little short on their UK Wii shipment.
3713280	3715360	Hold on, I'm sorry.
3715360	3720840	Pennsylvania is being charged the tax, and BlackWolf says I must have seen the video
3720840	3725880	on Joystiq because they have the tax in Pennsylvania, and that's where I guess the Joystiq video
3725880	3726880	came from.
3726880	3730680	Possibly, it's one of like 50 game blogs I read, so probably that is where I saw the
3730680	3731680	video.
3731680	3732680	Interesting though.
3732680	3740120	Anyways, so they apparently weren't able to ship all the units for the Wii for the launch,
3740120	3747680	but they are shipping more each week to hopefully be able to catch up before Christmas and get
3747680	3751600	as many units out there as possible.
3751600	3755720	With the whole launch this year, and even last year with the 360, it's not a big surprise
3755720	3760280	that they're short, and from what I read, they weren't short by that much.
3760280	3764200	It was only maybe 1,000 units or whatever.
3764200	3765360	It's not too bad.
3765360	3771240	It's not like the 200,000 units of, say, the PlayStation 3, which couldn't even hit the
3771240	3778440	200,000 unit mark and ended up being 197,000 units, so whatever.
3778440	3784640	But hopefully, you know what, UK, at least you're getting the system on time, because
3784640	3785840	you sure as hell don't have the PlayStation.
3785840	3787240	On time-ish.
3787240	3793560	On time-ish, but you're still not, I mean, a couple days is a lot better than, say, a
3793560	3794560	couple months.
3794560	3796560	Well, Nintendo is trying to make nice a little bit.
3796560	3800160	They have screwed over Europe constantly in the past, but now Europe is viewing this as,
3800160	3802040	hey, we're getting screwed again.
3802040	3805100	All our consoles are going to the targets in America.
3805100	3809100	You know I was at GameStop today, I'll say who it was, I don't care, I was at GameStop
3809100	3813400	today and I heard the clerk tell somebody, we're not really getting the Wiis in a lot,
3813400	3815120	you'd have better luck over at Target.
3815120	3819560	I was like, wow, that's a pretty, it's a good thing I'm not a secret shopper.
3819560	3823600	I probably would have, you know, FFFF on that guy.
3823600	3825400	I was pretty surprised to hear that.
3825400	3828880	I tell my customers that shit all the time, like when we had the 360s, when they first
3828880	3829880	launched.
3829880	3833640	I'm like, dude, Best Buy's got them right now, I'm all, you can go down there, pick
3833640	3836560	them up, because they were just turning around and selling them for like twice as much to
3836560	3842280	their customers, but, you know, I helped the guys score a couple Xbox 360s.
3842280	3844440	Wow, interesting.
3844440	3847440	I thought that was kind of interesting, anyway.
3847440	3851760	Well, I hope you folks in the UK are enjoying your system.
3851760	3857360	Nobody answered the call last week where we asked some of our British listeners to tape
3857360	3859120	folks in line that were waiting for the Wii.
3859120	3861580	No, no, they went to other game blogs instead.
3861580	3866180	We all saw the, you know, Germany crowd and Kotaku and all that other stuff, but nobody
3866180	3870800	loves us, but that's fine, we'll try not to be too butter over it.
3870800	3876440	Something that you should be aware of if you are in the CPL, that would be the Cyber Athlete
3876440	3881600	Professional League, they're going to be drug testing you at the start of gaming competitions
3881600	3882600	next year.
3882600	3884960	I'm sorry, that doesn't necessarily mean at the start of every competition, I just mean
3884960	3887640	at next year they will be testing for this.
3887640	3891600	It's kind of interesting because, you know, they're going to be testing for drugs, but
3891600	3895920	the comparison people are making is that, wow, it's like real sports.
3895920	3899800	Games are becoming closer and closer to being real sports, you know.
3899800	3902320	Can steroids enhance your game playing abilities?
3902320	3905940	So I suppose, you know, I suppose some drugs could make your reaction times better.
3905940	3911080	Let me get this very, very clear.
3911080	3914720	Video games are not a sport.
3914720	3919880	They will never, ever, ever be a sport.
3919880	3926120	This is including anything with the Wii, because granted you're moving around, okay.
3926120	3930800	The closest thing you may come to a sport, I guess, is Dance Dance Revolution, but that's
3930800	3934520	even still not even close.
3934520	3936040	Games are not a sport.
3936040	3937440	Football is a sport.
3937440	3942600	Deaf says not even Wii Sports.
3942600	3944600	Football is a sport.
3944600	3948240	Basketball is a sport, you know.
3948240	3950920	DARTED SUYA says DDR is a sport.
3950920	3953100	Not really.
3953100	3955840	In some foreign country out there, what was it?
3955840	3956840	Oh, that's right.
3956840	3958360	Was it Switzerland or something made it a sport?
3958360	3959840	Finland or something, I don't know.
3959840	3961160	Sorry, pardon our ignorance, folks.
3961160	3963200	We don't remember who it was.
3963200	3967880	That's kind of a funny story, though, that they're testing for drugs and stuff.
3967880	3977080	There is another article that missed our cut here, talking about soda highs in gamers.
3977080	3986000	Apparently caffeine is the gaming drug of choice, and they're talking about the description.
3986000	3987560	Caffeine absorption is complete.
3987560	3992780	Your pupils dilate, your blood pressure rises, and as a response, your liver dumps more sugar
3992780	3996720	into your bloodstream.
3996720	3998720	That's funny.
3998720	4000440	Caffeine is a drug?
4000440	4002520	Well, they can't really be testing for caffeine.
4002520	4003520	It's a legal drug.
4003520	4008920	If I want to drink a jumbo-sized coffee before I go play games, that's my right.
4008920	4009920	It's a legal drug.
4009920	4010920	I'm not doing anything wrong.
4010920	4011920	True.
4011920	4012920	I don't know.
4012920	4020880	I'd love to see them taking steroids if they throw the remotes through TVs and stuff.
4020880	4021880	That'd be hilarious.
4021880	4026360	I somehow doubt that.
4026360	4027920	There's actually some pretty cool stuff.
4027920	4034040	There was some sort of charity event where they were giving away a custom Guitar Hero
4034040	4037720	controller that was made out of a real guitar.
4037720	4043400	If you're interested in doing that, Kotaku linked to a story which basically has a how-to
4043400	4044400	on how you can do that.
4044400	4048000	I know this was also run on Hackaday and stuff like that.
4048000	4055320	The story actually comes from Toolmonger, so if you want to check it out, it's toolmonger.com.
4055320	4059920	It's how to build your own custom full-size wireless Guitar Hero controller.
4059920	4071160	It basically requires you to take apart a Guitar Hero controller and an actual guitar.
4071160	4072160	Pretty cool.
4072160	4074200	You can make some pretty sweet looking guitars from that.
4074200	4079000	It seems like a lot of money to burn just for a stupid controller.
4079000	4080640	It's just two games.
4080640	4083080	Well true, but you know what though?
4083080	4084080	I'm over Guitar Hero.
4084080	4087160	I am so over Guitar Hero, at least until the 360 version.
4087160	4088720	I am so over it.
4088720	4099880	People were buying the full-size arcade units for the Guitar Freaks, the arcade-style controllers.
4099880	4102560	Argue if you will, which is the better game, Guitar Freaks or Guitar Hero.
4102560	4105720	I don't really care, but at least Guitar Freaks has slightly more games available.
4105720	4106720	At least there's what?
4106720	4111160	Like you have Guitar Freaks V and then you only have four games for it.
4111160	4114840	There's Guitar Freaks 3 and 4, Guitar Freaks V, there's a server collection, 3-2.
4114840	4118920	And the fact that Guitar Freaks had an arcade machine that most people played on before
4118920	4122800	they played the home version, so people want to recreate that arcade experience at home.
4122800	4126720	Guitar Hero had no arcade machine.
4126720	4127720	I don't know.
4127720	4130360	It just seems a little silly.
4130360	4132840	It's a lot of money.
4132840	4138040	You can feed the starving children, if you think back to the story on the PlayStation
4138040	4139040	3 cost.
4139040	4145280	Anyway, I wanted to point this out as well, speaking of music games.
4145280	4147920	Big news in the DDR world this week.
4147920	4152840	Not only is DDR now being promoted through Burger King, of all things, did you see the
4152840	4153840	little toy?
4153840	4155380	Miklotov actually got one of the little toys.
4155380	4159440	It's the Dancing Boldo that you can press the little button and he does the little disco
4159440	4160440	dance.
4160440	4161440	It's all kinds of stupid.
4161440	4167880	But the other big news, if you've been following DDR for a couple of years, then you know that
4167880	4172620	folks were able to find that somewhere on the DDR extreme disk, the song Memories was
4172620	4173960	hidden away.
4173960	4177120	And people were figuring out for years, how are we going to get this song?
4177120	4178940	How's this song supposed to be unlocked?
4178940	4182560	And everybody thought, oh, maybe it'll be unlocked when Supernova comes out.
4182560	4184640	There'll be some type of link data, whatever it is.
4184640	4190360	Well, turns out, sure enough, this week an unlock code was released through the Burger
4190360	4192000	King promotion for Memories.
4192000	4197240	So you can finally unlock it legitimately, not using any type of Game Genie style hacks.
4197240	4200480	You can actually unlock it legitimately in DDR Extreme US.
4200480	4207240	You just plug a controller in port 2, right 4 times, up 3 times, square 1 time, left 2
4207240	4211400	times, down 3 times, square 2 times, and select 1 time.
4211400	4212600	Hopefully you got all that written down.
4212600	4216320	If not, you can go over to Burger King's website for the DDR promotion and play the stupid
4216320	4217320	little game they have.
4217320	4219480	And when you beat the game, you'll get the code.
4219480	4221800	So you can finally have Memories in that game.
4221800	4222840	Now here's my thought.
4222840	4225280	I don't think they waited two years for this.
4225280	4230520	I think this is how they've remedied the situation that was created when the link data in Supernova
4230520	4233560	kind of fell through, because you notice it was removed from the final version.
4233560	4236360	So there's no link data and no Supernova.
4236360	4239980	I bet you anything that was how it was supposed to happen.
4239980	4244880	But because it didn't happen this way, you got the debug code instead.
4244880	4245880	Makes sense.
4245880	4249120	I would bet money that that's what happened.
4249120	4250620	I would bet money.
4250620	4251720	And I swear I don't know anything.
4251720	4255240	I realize we have folks from Konami that come on the program, but they haven't told me anything.
4255240	4258400	That's my personal thought.
4258400	4260320	All right.
4260320	4263480	That's all the news we have for you tonight, but we do want to take some of your calls
4263480	4265040	because we're an interactive program.
4265040	4266040	So why don't you give us a call.
4266040	4267040	Are you using?
4267040	4268040	Oh.
4268040	4269040	I want to do one thing.
4269040	4270040	Here.
4270040	4271040	Yeah?
4271040	4272040	Website of the week.
4272040	4273040	Okay.
4273040	4274040	Oh, sure.
4274040	4275040	Well, then hold on.
4275040	4276560	I have to get some theme music for you if you want a website of the week.
4276560	4281040	Unfortunately, I don't have Jamie's typical song loaded, so you get this.
4281040	4284280	I hate you.
4284280	4285280	Anyways.
4285280	4288280	Loki's website of the week.
4288280	4289320	I thought this would be cool.
4289320	4293800	They just ran a story about this thing that they've got going for Nintendo.
4293800	4298600	It's actually for like a Christmas calendar type thing.
4298600	4299600	It's mission-in-snowdriftland.com.
4299600	4300600	Drift.
4300600	4301600	Yeah.
4301600	4302600	Funny.
4302600	4313040	But it's a bunch of little mini games that you can play, and it's counting down to Christmas.
4313040	4317080	And I don't know what exactly it is, but each game is kind of like Mario.
4317080	4319480	What was the website again?
4319480	4325760	It's www.mission-in-snowdriftland.com.
4325760	4331520	They've got a game for each calendar day, and of course, each one is unlocked as the
4331520	4332520	day's gone.
4332520	4333520	All right.
4333520	4338400	Loki's website of the week, boys and girls.
4338400	4340960	Temporarily this week's The Stark Soccer is on vacation.
4340960	4342240	All right.
4342240	4345600	Let's go to another call on Skype here.
4345600	4347320	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
4347320	4348320	Who's this?
4348320	4349320	Raven's Dolphin.
4349320	4350320	Hi, Raven's Dolphin.
4350320	4351320	What's on your mind, buddy?
4351320	4359520	The HDTVs and that lawsuit, I've been actually reading up on it.
4359520	4360920	What do you have to say about it?
4360920	4365000	They just seem like they're just out for money.
4365000	4367120	I said it before.
4367120	4373000	The trigger runs through Bluetooth.ir, and this thing is not motion sensitive.
4373000	4380320	It's just through this crappy D-pad, and it looks like a smart text phaser.
4380320	4385480	Why do you think they are, then, if they don't believe that they have this product first?
4385480	4389200	Why do you think they're going through with this lawsuit, which is not a cheap process?
4389200	4394880	I know that, but I think the goal is really because they're babies.
4394880	4400280	I guess the CEO's here, he's going to his kid, I want a Wii, I want a Wii, I can't get
4400280	4401280	a Wii.
4401280	4402280	So let's sue Nintendo.
4402280	4403280	Oh, come on.
4403280	4406960	You're thinking because some guy at this company could not get a Wii that they're going to
4406960	4407960	sue Nintendo?
4407960	4411080	That's a little bit far-fetched, don't you think?
4411080	4416320	A little, but it's just, it's this thing, you know, do you believe that they're actually
4416320	4417320	going to win?
4417320	4418320	I don't.
4418320	4423560	I don't think so, either, because the controller is a lot more intricate, but, you know, what
4423560	4424560	do I know?
4424560	4425560	And one more thing.
4425560	4426560	Yes?
4426560	4427560	Have you even heard of this company?
4427560	4431020	Have I even heard of what?
4431020	4432020	The company.
4432020	4433020	The company, literally.
4433020	4434020	Have you ever heard of it?
4434020	4437180	No, but they don't make game products, so they don't make something I follow, but apparently
4437180	4442420	they make PowerPoint push-button thingers for people who give lectures, like myself.
4442420	4445960	You think I would have heard of them, but mine comes through the projector, which is
4445960	4448740	made by, who is our projector, In Focus.
4448740	4450600	Here's a question, though, Rob.
4450600	4452840	Does the Wii do PowerPoint presentations?
4452840	4454280	No, it doesn't.
4454280	4457840	Granted, you could probably use the photo channel for that, but that's beyond the point.
4457840	4461460	No, I think the fact that the trigger uses Bluetooth and the other one's infrared is
4461460	4462460	going to be the end of this lawsuit.
4462460	4467400	The thing is, though, is they have a patent for, like, game controller device or whatever
4467400	4468400	like that.
4468400	4471720	This is a patent for new remote control for PC.
4471720	4475320	I think it's going to be completely different, and they're probably going to throw it out
4475320	4476320	once this comes in.
4476320	4482640	Hey, you know what, Raven's Dolphin, Raven's Dolphin, uh, Black Wolf in our chat room is
4482640	4488680	accusing you of stealing the Wii for the kid joke from his show and is threatening a lawsuit.
4488680	4492200	Uh, Black Wolf, yeah, I have.
4492200	4493200	Oh.
4493200	4494200	Ah!
4494200	4495200	I'm sorry, Black Wolf.
4495200	4496200	Kiss me later.
4496200	4500360	All right, well, now you have to plug Black Wolf Show, or else we're all getting sued.
4500360	4501640	Fine, I'll listen tonight.
4501640	4506920	Bobby Black Wolf Show, uh, 8 o'clock on Sunday nights before Orange Lounge.
4506920	4507920	That's 8 o'clock Eastern.
4507920	4508920	5 o'clock Pacific.
4508920	4509920	5 o'clock Pacific.
4509920	4511920	All right, there you go.
4511920	4515480	All right, uh, any other quick thoughts, Raven's Dolphin, before we get some more call?
4515480	4520280	Yeah, one quick, uh, if I was going to buy an HDTV, I'm just going to bring in my Xbox
4520280	4524800	360, hook it up to one of the televisions, and see how it looks on there.
4524800	4526400	Tweeter said I could do that.
4526400	4527600	Well, then there you go.
4527600	4530800	If the store will let you do that, then go for it.
4530800	4531800	That's what I'm going to do.
4531800	4534040	I'm not going to sit there and go, hmm, does this look good?
4534040	4535680	No, I want to see it firsthand.
4535680	4538120	All right, well, have fun with that, Raven's Dolphin.
4538120	4540720	We got to get some more calls, but thank you so much for your phone call.
4540720	4542080	We appreciate it.
4542080	4545080	Let's go to some more phone calls here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4545080	4546760	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4546760	4547760	Who's this?
4547760	4548760	Hey, guys.
4548760	4550360	This is Footy Monster.
4550360	4551360	Hey, Footy Monster.
4551360	4553360	What's on your mind, buddy?
4553360	4557600	I just wanted to go on about the whole Wiimote accident thing.
4557600	4558600	Uh, sure.
4558600	4559600	What about it?
4559600	4565880	Well, basically, if they do seem to know about the Wiimote accidents, shouldn't they sue
4565880	4571320	like baseball-making company persons and like people who play soccer on the street and hear
4571320	4574640	a person on the head with a ball or something?
4574640	4578480	No one's going to get sued over, I mean, have there actually been any lawsuits yet on this
4578480	4579480	yet?
4579480	4582720	I'm not hearing that there actually has been a lawsuit on this yet, but they'd be so stupid
4582720	4587360	because exactly the point that Footy Monster's bringing up here, you know what?
4587360	4592080	Accidents with toys happen around the house all the time, and do they get sued over it?
4592080	4596320	No, not unless the toy, you know, starts a fire, but that's a little different.
4596320	4599720	I haven't heard of any lawsuits yet.
4599720	4603400	If you actually go to Engadget, there is a picture of a boy who was playing with the
4603400	4609040	cousins with a Wii, and one of the kids was playing a baseball game, Wii Sports, and hitting
4609040	4615560	on the head with a Wiimote, and he has a whole mark on his forehead from the Wiimote, and
4615560	4616560	it's going to start happening.
4616560	4621440	There's going to be parents suing Nintendo about the Wiimote and their children's game.
4621440	4626080	But at the same time, Wii Sports shows a disclaimer right before you go into the game, and it
4626080	4631360	even shows the guy spinning around going, make sure there is nothing around you before
4631360	4635920	you start playing this game, and that would, you know, include your, you know, little brother.
4635920	4639040	So they were at fault for not reading the disclaimer, honestly.
4639040	4645040	I mean, you know, sucks to be the kid, but, you know, don't run at somebody who's flailing
4645040	4646920	their arms about like crazy.
4646920	4647920	You know?
4647920	4651880	Well, it's still, yeah, but it doesn't prevent the bad publicity, I mean, it doesn't prevent
4651880	4656800	any of the jacky-poos of the world going all over it about how, you know, Nintendo hurts
4656800	4657800	children.
4657800	4661480	I'll give you that, it doesn't do any good for Nintendo's publicity, but somebody needs
4661480	4666120	to put their foot down and say, look, Nintendo is not, you know, these guys are just being
4666120	4667120	idiots.
4667120	4668120	Yeah, I agree.
4668120	4672920	Well, that's all I wanted to say, and just kind of make it quick, give you a week?
4672920	4673920	Sure, sure.
4673920	4674920	Why not?
4674920	4679560	Okay, my little brother has the chicken pox, I never got him before, so I'm 23 and I'm
4679560	4680560	about to get him.
4680560	4684560	Uh-oh, run for the hills, you don't want that at the age of 23.
4684560	4688840	So you don't get chicken pox, you get shingles, that's always the question.
4688840	4694120	Oh, yuck, gross, gross, alright, stay far away, we'll pray or something that you don't
4694120	4695120	get it.
4695120	4696120	Okay, guys.
4696120	4699680	Alright, have a good one, buddy, and stay away from chicken pox.
4699680	4701800	Good to see you guys, thanks.
4701800	4704920	Well, I had it when I was seven, so I don't have to worry, did you have chicken pox when
4704920	4705920	you were younger?
4705920	4706920	I've never gotten them.
4706920	4707920	Oh, shit, you better be careful.
4707920	4708920	I said I've gotten them four times, I think I'm just...
4708920	4710480	How can you get chicken pox four times?
4710480	4712320	I don't know.
4712320	4713720	Are you sure it's just not Herbie's?
4713720	4714840	No, it's chicken pox.
4714840	4716720	Did you have them four times?
4716720	4721400	I purposely stayed around her to try to get them, and I never caught them, so I'm immune.
4721400	4727240	One eight seven seven game O-L-R is our 800 number, or you can call us on Skype, Orange
4727240	4729600	Lounge Radio is the username.
4729600	4737160	I've also never had my gallbladder out, and I've also my appendix, and my tonsils are
4737160	4742160	all in too, and I have all my wisdom teeth too.
4742160	4744800	I am one whole person.
4744800	4745800	Let's go to a call.
4745800	4748280	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who this?
4748280	4750800	You obviously know who this is, Legend of Zaku.
4750800	4754760	Well, hi, Legend of Zaku, but you see it's radio, and on the radio they can't see my
4754760	4758240	little Skype screen that shows me who's calling, and to be honest, I usually, I'll just click
4758240	4761280	the button, and whoever happens to be up gets lucky.
4761280	4765400	Unless somebody's calling repeatedly throughout the show, I'll not pick them up, but anyway,
4765400	4768280	you got lucky, your call got through, what do you want to say?
4768280	4775600	Well, basically, I want to throw out this question before anything.
4775600	4784240	Suppose that someone or something, some entity, were supposed to want to create a game on
4784240	4793760	a mobile cell phone, more like they want to create a rhythm based game, what would be
4793760	4797360	the best way, in your honest opinion, on how to approach this?
4797360	4801600	You don't, not in this country on these phones, don't put out a rhythm based game.
4801600	4805520	Wait, wait, wait, no, before you say that, I happen to work with these phones.
4805520	4812600	Okay, no, I understand, and you know what, phones are almost there, because we have phones
4812600	4816800	that can play the MP3s and all that stuff, but right now they don't really do it through,
4816800	4821680	unless you know something I don't, they don't really play the CD quality songs through the
4821680	4822960	little Java games.
4822960	4824860	Yeah, but that's the thing.
4824860	4829760	It's not supposed to be that sophisticated, it's supposed to be within the capacity of
4829760	4830760	the cell phone.
4830760	4841080	Now, I'm going to rephrase it, assuming within the maximum capacity of a cell phone, how
4841080	4843260	would you approach the situation?
4843260	4849840	Keep in mind that most phones can't even do simultaneous key presses.
4849840	4855360	My suggestion then would be not to approach it as a music game, but make it about the
4855360	4868440	timing that maybe could be set to music, something along those lines where maybe it's about pressing
4868440	4873080	the keys at the right time or whatever, but even then, I don't know, I honestly can't
4873080	4875840	imagine a game like that being too incredibly thrilling.
4875840	4879120	I don't know, maybe if I had some nice visuals or something.
4879120	4884560	What about feature wise, like internet ranking or downloadable content?
4884560	4887960	Sure why not, downloadable stuff, internet, all that stuff is good.
4887960	4894520	Yeah, basically more like a game and a personalization app at the same time.
4894520	4900160	Okay sure, I can see, I can look at the rankings or whatever, that's always fun I guess.
4900160	4903280	Alright, well there you have it, what was your other question, we've got to keep moving,
4903280	4905160	what else was on your mind?
4905160	4911240	I don't know, I've been talking to Rama recently, and I know this was something else.
4911240	4918280	By the way, sorry, completely different topic, Rama, I saw Rama on GameTap TV, I was just
4918280	4921240	kind of curious what kind of stuff they were showing on GameTap TV, and if you go to their
4921240	4927200	recent, I don't know, whatever it is that Victor Lucas hosts, the GameTap news thing
4927200	4933080	or whatever the heck it is, you can see Rama for like a split second in this little montage
4933080	4936800	of what was going on at the Wii launch, and I would have missed him if it wasn't for the
4936800	4942360	fact that he's the only black Luigi I know anywhere, so you can spot him on my way.
4942360	4945840	Anyway, sorry, so about your conversations with Rama.
4945840	4952880	Let me see, I know we were planning to do, in other words, I don't know if you guys would,
4952880	4959360	let's say that, to put it this way, I've been having conversations where there's various
4959360	4964680	other DDR players on something that we plan to do for charity, it hasn't been set in stone
4964680	4971040	yet, but we need more support and backing, and basically, in the event that this does
4971040	4977400	happen, I don't know how much support you're willing to give us, if any.
4977400	4981560	Well we'll consider anything, just send us an email and we'll see what we can do.
4981560	4982560	It's a charity thing?
4982560	4983560	Right.
4983560	4984560	Usually we're going to do that.
4984560	4992060	We're planning to do something along that line, some sort of gaming event for a cause.
4992060	4997840	Is it more original than the we're going to break the Guinness Book of World Record thing?
4997840	5000600	We haven't determined that yet.
5000600	5002520	Right now it's in exploratory mode.
5002520	5006240	All I'm going to say is that if you're going to do the Guinness Book of World Record thing,
5006240	5010520	that thing's been done like six times now, so please do something to make it more original.
5010520	5011520	Okay, good.
5011520	5016760	We're probably doing something completely different, like a big gathering of gamers.
5016760	5021360	We don't care about the records as long as we raise money.
5021360	5024980	Whatever you decide, sure, put it in writing, send it to us, we'll consider anything.
5024980	5028480	We have some of our listeners that run anime conventions that want us to come, and if we
5028480	5034160	can reasonably make it, sure, especially if the event is in California, we have an easy
5034160	5035160	time making it.
5035160	5041080	The whole purpose of this is just to shed the other side of the DDR community, more
5041080	5044680	the charitable and heartful side of it.
5044680	5045680	Sounds good to me.
5045680	5048320	If we can't be there in person, we can at least send some prizes.
5048320	5051520	Well, yeah, whatever you're able to provide us, that'll be cool.
5051520	5052520	All right.
5052520	5054960	Well, we can't turn this program into a sales pitch, so send me an email and we'll see what
5054960	5055960	we can do, okay?
5055960	5056960	All right.
5056960	5057960	All right.
5057960	5058960	Zaku, thanks so much for your call.
5058960	5059960	Have a good one, okay?
5059960	5060960	Okay.
5060960	5061960	Bye.
5061960	5062960	Good luck with your event and your cell phone game.
5062960	5063960	Yes, Logan?
5063960	5067720	I'd like to make a mention real quick that you were talking about earlier when we were
5067720	5071360	discussing the Spike TV video game award winners.
5071360	5075600	We didn't really leak them because they just put out for us release with all the winners
5075600	5076600	now.
5076600	5077600	Oh, well, whatever.
5077600	5080160	I mean, every freaking game website had that list anyway.
5080160	5082160	It's not like we're telling you anything that revolutionary.
5082160	5084720	You know what cell phone game they should work on?
5084720	5092680	It's called Stop Playing With Your Cell Phone and Drive Your Fucking SUV, The Game.
5092680	5093680	I like that idea.
5093680	5094680	All right.
5094680	5096800	Thank you guys so much for all your great calls on Skype tonight.
5096800	5098640	We are going to close the Skype line at this time.
5098640	5101880	Of course, if you didn't get three, you can always leave us a voicemail.
5101880	5107080	Our voicemail of the week, 1-877-GAME-OLR, and leave us your thoughts.
5107080	5110960	That's available to the many of you that listen to us on the podcast.
5110960	5111960	We appreciate that.
5111960	5112960	All right.
5112960	5117120	Loki, any last minute stories?
5117120	5118120	Not really.
5118120	5119520	Nothing that I really want to mention, I guess.
5119520	5120520	I don't know.
5120520	5121520	Wow.
5121520	5127960	I forgot to mention I played, and it was such an impact on me that I forgot the name of
5127960	5128960	the game even.
5128960	5132320	The new Xbox Live Arcade game, RoboBlitz.
5132320	5133320	I played that.
5133320	5134320	It was okay.
5134320	5135320	I played it for like two seconds.
5135320	5136320	I didn't get it.
5136320	5137320	I didn't buy it.
5137320	5138320	I didn't buy it either.
5138320	5139320	I played the demo, yeah.
5139320	5140320	So, yeah.
5140320	5142120	I'll give it another try a little later.
5142120	5143960	Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood when I played it.
5143960	5144960	I guess.
5144960	5147960	It was interesting.
5147960	5151560	You know what they really need to put out on Xbox Live Arcade?
5151560	5152560	MDK.
5152560	5153560	MDK would be awesome.
5153560	5154560	That'd be pretty rad.
5154560	5155560	I would love MDK.
5155560	5156560	All right.
5156560	5158360	Well, I guess that's it for the show.
5158360	5159360	We're all out of news.
5159360	5162440	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.
5162440	5167880	You guys are awesome for coming and listening to us every week, especially when we've been
5167880	5170840	down for a couple weeks, and unfortunately, it's not going to get any better with Christmas
5170840	5171840	and New Year's on the horizon.
5171840	5176560	But we appreciate you guys sticking with us as we move into our, if you can believe it,
5176560	5182600	as of January 2007, our third year of podcasting, and also in 2007, our fifth year of internet
5182600	5183600	radio, if you can believe.
5183600	5187440	Actually, going into our sixth year, because we're going to hit our fifth birthday in 2007,
5187440	5188440	if you can believe it.
5188440	5190920	Crazy stuff, huh?
5190920	5193580	Anyway, that's going to do it.
5193580	5195520	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5195520	5200360	Gee, my guess will start with my guess, Loki.
5200360	5205640	My final thought is that popcorn shrimp was delicious.
5205640	5210200	And my final thought is now everybody's gone to dinner without me, and Dark Sakura's not
5210200	5211200	here.
5211200	5213320	So we can't go say hi to our favorite waitress at Lion's.
5213320	5214320	That makes me sad.
5214320	5218440	Hi, Jeannie, if you're listening, we love you.
5218440	5219440	Thanks again, everybody.
5219440	5220440	We'll see you next week.
5220440	5222280	We will be live again next week with another program.
5222280	5227000	I hear it might be the holiday episode, because Dark Sakura was saying something about Chris
5227000	5231880	coming back, and Chris wants to do some holiday joy with us, so that should be fun.
5231880	5234640	Ho, ho, ho, next week on Orange Lounge Radio.
5234640	5235640	We'll see you then.
