1
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:38,917
[SPEAKER_07]: We are live at the E3 Outpost in West Los Angeles.

3
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:44,204
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the sound sounds a little bit different tonight, that's because we're recording live here at the Arena Interactive Lounge.

4
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:45,185
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,427
[SPEAKER_07]: You might know me as Sky.

6
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:49,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:50,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

8
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:51,112
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing?

9
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:52,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Tired.

10
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:52,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?

11
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited and tired at the same time.

12
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:56,176
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very bizarre feeling.

13
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:58,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

14
00:00:58,278 --> 00:00:58,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

15
00:00:58,998 --> 00:00:59,679
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, Loki?

16
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,641
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing good.

17
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:02,341
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

18
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:06,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Also joining us tonight, we have some special guests, or a special guest, I should say.

19
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:07,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to Bobby.

20
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:07,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby.

21
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:09,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys.

22
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:09,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Bobby.

23
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:11,048
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a thrill for me.

24
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:12,930
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about time we got you on our show.

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,632
[SPEAKER_07]: It just took E3 to finally get you here.

26
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:16,913
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright.

27
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:21,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Also we want to say a shout out to Mr. Lawrence Young who's manning the controls tonight.

28
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:23,497
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate his help in making the show work.

29
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:25,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get right into it.

30
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's not waste time.

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about E3.

32
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:33,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought we could do, let's go down the line and talk about three interesting things we saw at E3 today.

33
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:34,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, give us one.

34
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:38,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to say Zelda Twilight Princess.

35
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:40,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting to play that was pretty fun.

36
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:42,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, did you play the Zelda Twilight Princess on the Wii?

37
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:43,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii!

38
00:01:43,824 --> 00:01:44,425
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii!

39
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:46,686
[SPEAKER_01]: I played on the Wii, and I went Wii.

40
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:48,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Nintendo have a huge-ass line for the Wii today?

41
00:01:49,308 --> 00:01:53,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Not if you made it in there in the early... We got in there at the tail end of the early media hours.

42
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:53,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

43
00:01:53,992 --> 00:01:56,554
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just sort of... Once we got in line, it was pretty cool.

44
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:59,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get to hear... I never remember his name.

45
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:02,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I know his name's Charles, the guy who's Mario's voice.

46
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:02,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, right, yeah.

47
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Sing the old Mario theme song from the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.

48
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,641
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

49
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:12,263
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys in front of us got him to, the guys from the Mushroom Kingdom, got him to sing it.

50
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:13,803
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have it on tape.

51
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:14,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.

52
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:15,324
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

53
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:15,844
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty fun.

54
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:21,127
[SPEAKER_07]: So tell us about how is Zelda on the Wii different from what we saw last year with the GameCube?

55
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:24,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, I didn't get to see it on the GameCube, so I don't know.

56
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know that it is widescreen, whereas the GameCube version is not.

57
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:34,497
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm so glad to hear there's widescreen support, because I was really worried about that with Wii.

58
00:02:34,577 --> 00:02:35,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you're going to get 480p.

59
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:36,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

60
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:39,041
[SPEAKER_07]: But probably nothing more than that.

61
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:39,501
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

62
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:41,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, it's something.

63
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,784
[SPEAKER_07]: At least my widescreen TV isn't going to go to total waste.

64
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:45,925
[SPEAKER_07]: So that makes me happy.

65
00:02:47,246 --> 00:02:49,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so that's one for Jamie.

66
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what would you say is one interesting thing you saw today?

67
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:58,472
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite, you know, it was really a toss-up on Sega's booth because there's a few things I liked.

68
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:02,434
[SPEAKER_06]: I did get to play my first PS3 game, which would be Full Auto 2.

69
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:05,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, you know, me being such a big Full Auto whore.

70
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:06,897
[SPEAKER_07]: They have Full Auto 2 there?

71
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:07,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally missed that.

72
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:09,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they had full auto too.

73
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:15,879
[SPEAKER_06]: They were debuting basically all the deathmatch modes, which I said should have been in the first one, but no.

74
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:22,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, they had that, and we were basically playing six-player deathmatch and stuff, and if you won, you'd get a hat.

75
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:25,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I don't wear hats, so I didn't care.

76
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:28,102
[SPEAKER_06]: But overall, the controls are basically the same.

77
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:33,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Horrible framerate problems, just like the first one.

78
00:03:33,903 --> 00:03:36,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we're talking dropping down a crawl.

79
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:39,326
[SPEAKER_06]: but then again it's not finished either, so.

80
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think it's just an early build issue?

81
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:48,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, I'm not sure because the fact the first one had really bad frame rate problems too, so you never know.

82
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:51,100
[SPEAKER_06]: But I am sure it's not done.

83
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

84
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:56,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to remind folks, if you guys are hearing ambient noise in the background, that is because we're not at your usual studio.

85
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:59,986
[SPEAKER_07]: We are at the Arena Interactive Lounge where the E3 Outpost has taken place.

86
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:02,748
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in the LA area, this thing's going on all week.

87
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:03,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on down.

88
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:04,929
[SPEAKER_07]: We're off Santa Monica Boulevard.

89
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:07,111
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be here Thursday and Friday taping live as well.

90
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:08,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Other folks are taping too.

91
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:11,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Scott Rubin and Lawrence Young doing their show.

92
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:13,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Gamer Andy's got his gig going on.

93
00:04:13,815 --> 00:04:15,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf, Friday night, of course.

94
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:18,038
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what this place is?

95
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,360
[SPEAKER_07]: There's big widescreen TVs everywhere.

96
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,881
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a big gamer frat house.

97
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:22,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

98
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:23,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, what it's like.

99
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:23,962
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

100
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:24,702
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool.

101
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:30,004
[SPEAKER_07]: So, again, if we sound a little different out of our elements, it's because we are, but that's a good thing.

102
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:35,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyway, I just wanted to give that a plug because we are kind of using their equipment tonight, so we have to give them a big thank you.

103
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:37,687
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're also in their chat room because of it.

104
00:04:37,707 --> 00:04:38,708
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to keep an eye on it.

105
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:40,648
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little harder because we're not in our usual setup.

106
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:43,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.allgames.com Thank you.

107
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:47,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's this wristband on my arm that says over 21, which means they have alcohol here.

108
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:48,852
[SPEAKER_06]: That means you get to drink.

109
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I got asked if I was over 21.

110
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,526
[SPEAKER_07]: You always get carded.

111
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:57,608
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we didn't get those, so we'll get those later.

112
00:04:57,808 --> 00:04:58,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

113
00:04:58,368 --> 00:04:59,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

114
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:00,449
[SPEAKER_01]: You're interesting.

115
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,870
[SPEAKER_07]: My interesting thing.

116
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:08,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give a shout-out to the music game fans, because I know we have a lot of music game fans that listen to the program and are dying to know.

117
00:05:08,414 --> 00:05:12,736
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me talk about the Bomani setup at Konami's booth, which was very interesting.

118
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:13,957
[SPEAKER_07]: They sort of have a round setup.

119
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,879
[SPEAKER_07]: 2DX Distorted Machine is there.

120
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:19,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Freaks V2 is there.

121
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:20,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

122
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:21,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

123
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:24,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami did not announce that Distorted is coming out for the home here.

124
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:27,907
[SPEAKER_07]: They did not announce they're porting Guitar Freaks here in the US.

125
00:05:28,187 --> 00:05:30,990
[SPEAKER_07]: So they were just there to get butts in the booth, I guess.

126
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I did get a chance to play each of the three new DDR home versions.

127
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:36,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I did play around on Universe.

128
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Universe looks a lot better than it does in the trailer, I'll tell you that.

129
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:42,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Universe has a very disco, funky feel to it.

130
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,677
[SPEAKER_07]: The interface is a little crazy.

131
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:48,799
[SPEAKER_07]: The song select was kind of... It's like a 3D wheel.

132
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:49,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked it.

133
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I kind of liked it.

134
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:50,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I dug it.

135
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are repeats from old mixes.

136
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:54,722
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed Gyruss was in the demo.

137
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:56,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's other stuff, too.

138
00:05:56,763 --> 00:05:57,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure...

139
00:05:58,284 --> 00:06:02,007
[SPEAKER_07]: TDR, Freak Group, OmaniStyle have lists posted already of what's on those games.

140
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually really liked Ultramix 4.

141
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:06,950
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of thought Ultramix 4 had the better song list.

142
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,951
[SPEAKER_07]: The interface is just kind of like an upside-down Ultramix 2.

143
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:13,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's another Ultramix, but I thought it had a better song list.

144
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:14,875
[SPEAKER_07]: It has Listen to Your Heart, it had Bitmania.

145
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:17,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a lot of fun playing that.

146
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:22,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried playing doubles on Universe and unfortunately they had the pads set backwards.

147
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So that didn't work.

148
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Supernova is exactly what you'd expect.

149
00:06:27,624 --> 00:06:29,766
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course they have two Supernova machines, the home version.

150
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:32,348
[SPEAKER_07]: But, Jamie, did you play DDR Supernova home version?

151
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:32,889
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

152
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:34,130
[SPEAKER_07]: David Bowie's in it.

153
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's dance.

154
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:36,011
[SPEAKER_01]: D.D.R.

155
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:55,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially these demos.

156
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:01,151
[SPEAKER_07]: My thrill on DDR is the extra modes and the extra things that are in it, and they're not in these builds.

157
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:05,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just glad they had freaking arcade cabinets there because I hate playing on those goddamn softpads.

158
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:07,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you notice that they have the softpads?

159
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:11,415
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like literally saran-wrapped to the floor.

160
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:13,195
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not duct tape.

161
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:14,716
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you think of the Universe 360 pads?

162
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:17,713
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just like soft pads.

163
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:22,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I get lost on them again because, you know, I don't know.

164
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:26,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually going to go play Karaoke Revolution Country Edition tomorrow.

165
00:07:26,876 --> 00:07:28,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm going to our chat room.

166
00:07:28,277 --> 00:07:30,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, we're temporarily tonight in chat.

167
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:33,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Allgames.com will be there all week long because we love Allgames.com.

168
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:35,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

169
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Weiland wants to know, wait, Bowie is in what?

170
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,081
[SPEAKER_07]: David Bowie's Let's Dance is going to be a danceable song in DDR Supernova.

171
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:47,805
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also going to the chat room there, let's see.

172
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:52,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Sephiroth1215, one of our fans, says, I hate Kelly.

173
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, a lot of people do, but a lot of people like her, you know?

174
00:07:56,313 --> 00:08:04,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of Kelly, it seems that they've dropped the Karaoke Revolution title from American Idol, if you noticed that on the trailer.

175
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

176
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:05,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, I didn't notice.

177
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:12,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they didn't really... First off, the game's not even to a point where they can show it at E3, which is why we have country here.

178
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:14,705
[SPEAKER_06]: But they dropped the title.

179
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:19,588
[SPEAKER_06]: All they really had for the video was just, you know, the intro that you see normally on American Idol.

180
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:21,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just says, coming in the winter.

181
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:21,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.

182
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:22,389
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

183
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby, do you have an interesting thing you want to share with us that you saw today?

184
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:34,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, unfortunately I didn't get to play all that much today just because of getting in late and just walking around and making sure I saw everything.

185
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:46,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than the utterly disappointing Square Theater, which is usually a wonderful production with great production values, lights everywhere, everything's synchronized.

186
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:48,140
[SPEAKER_08]: This time it was just a digital projection.

187
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I did get to play Gitaro Man Lives.

188
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:52,762
[SPEAKER_08]: for the PSP.

189
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:55,484
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're sitting there, you're smiling and nodding.

190
00:08:55,684 --> 00:08:56,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't.

191
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:58,867
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a straight port of the PlayStation 2.

192
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:01,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Same music, same note patterns and everything.

193
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:05,372
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing that has changed is now if you pause it, you can continue.

194
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,553
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to start over.

195
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:09,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you also have a duet mode.

196
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:10,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they?

197
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:11,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they didn't show that.

198
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:15,220
[SPEAKER_01]: You play as Kira, who was, I guess, the girl in the game.

199
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:18,263
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do duet mode with her, and there's a versus mode.

200
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:19,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

201
00:09:19,637 --> 00:09:21,340
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a versus mode in PS2 version, though.

202
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:27,792
[SPEAKER_01]: It was showing it off like it was some sort of Mew thing, but the duet mode I know is Mew.

203
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:28,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

204
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:28,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

205
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:30,377
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's still all the same songs?

206
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:32,246
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a bit of a letdown.

207
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:37,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I was hoping for some new Guitar Room Man, but I guess some people will be excited to see that it's on the go.

208
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:37,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

209
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:38,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, whatever.

210
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to go back to this Square Enix trailer.

211
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:47,654
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I feel horrible saying this because I thought Square had some of the nicest staff that I dealt with all day.

212
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:49,895
[SPEAKER_07]: They had really great staff, and they were nice.

213
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:56,238
[SPEAKER_07]: But the trailer presentation was a letdown because a lot of what they were showing was stuff that's already out.

214
00:09:56,578 --> 00:09:57,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.

215
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:58,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Although...

216
00:09:59,119 --> 00:09:59,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

217
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they, Lauren?

218
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:21,779
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see, we'll see.

219
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:28,722
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, again, these trailers, it's the same reason why I'm not screaming and hollering about Halo 3 yet.

220
00:10:28,882 --> 00:10:33,284
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a trailer that didn't show us much of the actual game itself, you know what I mean?

221
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:37,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's wait until I can actually get my hand on the controller, play it, try it out.

222
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:41,927
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, the Square thing will give the fans what they want, so whatever.

223
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:43,448
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll have a good time with that.

224
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:47,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, number two, a second interesting thing you saw today.

225
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitar Hero 2.

226
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:57,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, how is that compared to... It was fun, but it basically brought in the two... Actually, it really added in something else that I wouldn't have minded seeing.

227
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted bass mode in the first one, and this gives me bass mode.

228
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:06,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of having versus play, you have cooperative play, which is how I think it should be anyway.

229
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:11,161
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a band on stage, if one person sucks, the whole band's going to pretty much blow it.

230
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:12,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

231
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:18,226
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way it works now is that player one is lead guitar, player two, depending on song, is either bass or rhythm.

232
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:25,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're even bringing in the very newest models for their available guitars, the newest Gibson guitars available.

233
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:28,355
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still going to have the Flying V, they brought in the Thunderbirds.

234
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:29,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Thunderbird now.

235
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:34,179
[SPEAKER_01]: They still have the Les Paul, the SGs.

236
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,763
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's still hidden characters in it, new unlockable content.

237
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:43,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I played YYZ, that was like cool.

238
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:46,463
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really awesome.

239
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:53,325
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, are there enough differences from the first game to make this, you know, a worthwhile sequel?

240
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:55,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see enough to really make a judgment like that yet.

241
00:11:56,526 --> 00:12:01,147
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, just having new songs to play is great.

242
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:05,668
[SPEAKER_01]: If it were me, I would have been... I mean, I know it is on PlayStation 2, but...

243
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:09,711
[SPEAKER_01]: FanTaz says Halo 3 teaser ripped off System Shock.

244
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:34,848
[SPEAKER_07]: So, not a person who wasn't a big fan of the Halo 3, or maybe he was a fan of the Halo 3 teaser, but just felt it, ripped off another one.

245
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:39,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Funnydale says, it's sad, Square is turning Final Fantasy into the new Madden.

246
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:41,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of agree with that.

247
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:42,652
[SPEAKER_08]: They need to get off Final Fantasy 7.

248
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:44,473
[SPEAKER_08]: They are killing it.

249
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:47,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy 7 football, I bet, will be next year's announcement.

250
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:48,315
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

251
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:52,558
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like some folks in the chat room are getting buffer tonight.

252
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:56,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, I'm sure we're getting bombarded with people tonight, which is amazing.

253
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys for supporting the show.

254
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget it will be on our podcast stream a little later.

255
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:02,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

256
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:07,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody had said something about Guitar Room Man.

257
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say it was Xander here.

258
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:16,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Xander C says, I restarted at least three times accidentally on the original Guitar-O-Man because I couldn't pause.

259
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:18,580
[SPEAKER_07]: So that new feature will come in handy.

260
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Xander also says, Final Fantasy Versus XIII is being made by the Kingdom Hearts 2 team.

261
00:13:23,343 --> 00:13:23,983
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.

262
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:25,564
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a joint production.

263
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:26,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy.

264
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:27,785
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing, dude.

265
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:30,467
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all we know about Final Fantasy Versus XIII.

266
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:31,708
[SPEAKER_07]: The trailer didn't tell us shit.

267
00:13:31,988 --> 00:13:38,712
[SPEAKER_07]: It tells you that there's a main male character who has psychic Miss Cleo gone way wrong abilities and that's about it.

268
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:39,812
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyway.

269
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw a gunblade.

270
00:13:42,294 --> 00:13:43,855
[SPEAKER_07]: In the original Final Fantasy XIII, yes.

271
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:44,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

272
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:50,659
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's a Final Fantasy XIII mobile, but I'm not even going to go there because I'll cry.

273
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki!

274
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Something interesting.

275
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:54,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well, let's see here.

276
00:13:55,493 --> 00:13:58,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I did, of course, also play the Wii.

277
00:13:58,374 --> 00:13:59,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to play Red Steel.

278
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:02,616
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was okay, actually.

279
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:10,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I'm still kind of... It's the first time I've played it, and I thought that the controls were way too sensitive.

280
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:10,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Like...

281
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,445
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very awkward playing it, and it did not feel natural.

282
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:26,957
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I were a very judgmental mom buying this for my kids, I would probably be turned away by it if it's going to stay like this.

283
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:31,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it wasn't easy, but...

284
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:36,887
[SPEAKER_06]: There were other games that were also being shown, like WarioWare, which was really awesome.

285
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:39,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just what they're doing with the controller is amazing.

286
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:42,191
[SPEAKER_06]: What you would expect from a WarioWare game.

287
00:14:43,432 --> 00:14:52,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Overall, though, the Wii stuff, I did play Red Steel, I played a WarioWare, and this kind of like obstacle course tech demo thing.

288
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,662
[SPEAKER_06]: And each one very sensitive as far as the control scheme goes.

289
00:14:57,462 --> 00:15:00,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Loki and DarkSakura, I didn't spend a lot of time at Nintendo's booth today.

290
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:01,826
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so crowded.

291
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:03,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate their layout this year.

292
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:04,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the layout is ass.

293
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:06,850
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a claustrophobic nightmare.

294
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:12,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Nintendo, but having that huge dome in the middle, that was a horrible idea.

295
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:18,019
[SPEAKER_07]: But tell us about, for those, because a lot of folks listening aren't going to E3, how is Nintendo's booth set up?

296
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,340
[SPEAKER_07]: How did you guys get in there?

297
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,741
[SPEAKER_07]: What happens when you get in there?

298
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:27,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're around basically the surrounding wall when you're in line and you go in, and it's like a spiral.

299
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:29,286
[SPEAKER_06]: They have these talking walls.

300
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:36,771
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like walls of pictures of people sitting in white rooms or whatever, but they actually have a camera and can talk to you, and they have the voice of Mario there.

301
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:39,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's how we got to hear him sing.

302
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:45,556
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was funny, though, because I was like, well, why do they have people mocking me in line as I'm waiting?

303
00:15:45,657 --> 00:15:46,277
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

304
00:15:46,357 --> 00:15:47,758
[SPEAKER_06]: It was interesting, a little bit different.

305
00:15:47,818 --> 00:15:49,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the point was, but...

306
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,492
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one of those guys that was very knowledgeable and kept giving a lot of really good information.

307
00:15:55,232 --> 00:15:59,933
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sort of like having a rep there to talk with you while you're in line to sort of hype you up to go see it.

308
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:10,817
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you got in, you circled around and went on this raised platform with sort of half of it covered in a picture on one side and the other side.

309
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there were three in the middle.

310
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:17,381
[SPEAKER_01]: and three widescreen TVs and different people were playing different games.

311
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:20,983
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another one on the wall, but that was sort of for when they did the drum demo.

312
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:21,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

313
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:27,807
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we went through there, Koji Kondo was playing the orchestra game and I got his autograph.

314
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:28,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.

315
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:30,529
[SPEAKER_01]: That made me very, very happy.

316
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:32,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that orchestra thing actually a game or just a demo?

317
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:33,311
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a game.

318
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:34,232
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a demo.

319
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:37,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they said it was going to... It's a tech demo.

320
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:40,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess we will see.

321
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:40,676
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

322
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:44,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, shut up.

323
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,599
[SPEAKER_07]: If I wanted your opinion, I'd turn your mic on.

324
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:58,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they had a series of demo games playable and they were bringing out different ones as though they were going to be released later on as packaged items.

325
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:00,383
[SPEAKER_01]: At least as far as I was led to believe.

326
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:07,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, looking at what they were talking about yesterday during the press conference is that they have this Wii Sports thing.

327
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:11,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And it actually looks like a collection of a bunch of small games.

328
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:17,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost like, remember the first Nintendo system where they had it packaged with Mario and Duck Hunt?

329
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:35,562
[SPEAKER_06]: they would have a bunch of small tech demo things that kind of almost orient you to this new control scheme so they have the baseball, golf, tennis and a pilot wings type of game which is very kind of different Bobby, a second interesting thing you saw today

330
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:38,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Blink, blink, blink, blink.

331
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:45,887
[SPEAKER_08]: The sensitive controls of Sonic the Hedgehog on the PS3.

332
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:47,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't that weird?

333
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:48,769
[SPEAKER_07]: It made me cry.

334
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I was not a fan of Sonic on PS3, I have to admit.

335
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:56,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know how many times I fell off the edge?

336
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:57,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I watched.

337
00:17:57,497 --> 00:18:00,220
[SPEAKER_01]: It had so much potential to be good, and...

338
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:04,968
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can see Jamie getting motion sickness from that, just because of the way it was jumping around.

339
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:06,889
[SPEAKER_01]: I left it with a headache.

340
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:11,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I felt nauseous and had a headache, and on top of that, my heart was broken.

341
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thank you, Sony.

342
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:16,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, do you think the Xbox version will be just as bad?

343
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:18,729
[SPEAKER_08]: That's in the Sega booth, we'll have to check.

344
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:20,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'll have to look tomorrow.

345
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,473
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to find out, and if it is, then I'll blame Sega, and I'll go cry there.

346
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:30,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I played the one in the Sega booth, and the controls, the camera kind of was pissing me off, and I couldn't figure out how to play.

347
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:32,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I was playing the Silver Sonic one.

348
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,583
[SPEAKER_06]: They had two different levels, one as Sonic, one as Silver Sonic.

349
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:43,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Silver Sonic being like Super Duper Super Saiyan Sonic with psycho, you know, kinetic powers and crap, so I don't know.

350
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:52,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, one of the things I do want to mention about the PS3 controller, because we got to actually see it and play it, that a lot of people don't realize, because you've never really seen a good look of it.

351
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,000
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, the PlayStation Circle button in the middle is touchable.

352
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,261
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't do anything in what we had.

353
00:18:57,702 --> 00:19:03,107
[SPEAKER_08]: But the L2 and the R2 buttons are now like the triggers on the Xbox.

354
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:04,208
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not straight buttons.

355
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,329
[SPEAKER_08]: They are actually, you know...

356
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:07,722
[SPEAKER_08]: analog triggers.

357
00:19:07,742 --> 00:19:08,862
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was kind of interesting.

358
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed my number two.

359
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:14,345
[SPEAKER_07]: My number two thing I thought was interesting today would be Luminous Live.

360
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:19,607
[SPEAKER_07]: It's way back in the corner of the very crowded Microsoft booth, but oh my god.

361
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:23,128
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just Luminous on the TV.

362
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:24,829
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I wanted.

363
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:25,509
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

364
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,431
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and if this is only going to be five bucks, I'm betting it'll probably be 800 points, not 400.

365
00:19:30,472 --> 00:19:30,832
[SPEAKER_07]: But even then, I...

366
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:35,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

367
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:52,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Any of you other guys go to Microsoft's booth today?

368
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:57,040
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like you guys spent most of your day in West Hall, whereas Bobby and I are mostly in South Hall today.

369
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a Viva Pinata, the demo, the presentation of Viva Pinata in there.

370
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:09,230
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, let's see, Animal Crossing meets Harvest Moon meets Spore meets some other stuff probably.

371
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:10,592
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of the way it looked.

372
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:12,834
[SPEAKER_08]: And I still don't know really what it is.

373
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Remind me to look for Spore tomorrow.

374
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:17,876
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all in EA's stuff.

375
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:19,077
[SPEAKER_07]: We've totally missed EA today.

376
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:20,717
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll definitely have more tomorrow.

377
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:28,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't they say they were going to have a new Need for Speed game?

378
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking for that today, but I didn't see it at all.

379
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:33,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it Need for Speed Carbon, I think?

380
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:39,609
[SPEAKER_07]: One more interesting thing you saw today, DarkSakura.

381
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:41,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're typing in chat right now.

382
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're arguing with somebody about graphics versus gameplay?

383
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,413
[SPEAKER_01]: That pisses me off so much.

384
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:50,356
[SPEAKER_01]: What I just said is I don't want a pretty game that plays like crap.

385
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:54,179
[SPEAKER_07]: A system that's only as good as the games that are on it?

386
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:55,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

387
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,702
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that to a Sony rep today and he just sort of blinked at me.

388
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:00,868
[SPEAKER_01]: It was funny.

389
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does that not surprise me?

390
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:05,990
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he blinked, and he thought about it, because you know you're right.

391
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:07,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

392
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:15,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, anyway, my number one, and actually my list has been about equal, but I have to say Sonic Rivals on PSP.

393
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:15,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?

394
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:17,335
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.

395
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:21,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, it was like everything that I loved about Sonic with Racing Shadow.

396
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:25,478
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like playing a 2D Sonic, but 3D.

397
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:26,159
[SPEAKER_01]: It was...

398
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:31,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fast and great, and I just had the most fun, and then they gave me a t-shirt that I can't wear.

399
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,302
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like three sizes too big.

400
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:35,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's cool.

401
00:21:35,142 --> 00:21:36,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Does Sega have a theater this year?

402
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:39,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see, I don't think so.

403
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:45,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to explore Sega in more detail tomorrow, but I was just like, I'm...

404
00:21:46,761 --> 00:21:49,082
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good Sonic game on PS3.

405
00:21:49,162 --> 00:21:52,584
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's only one level I got to play, but if the whole thing's like that, I'm all over that.

406
00:21:53,345 --> 00:22:06,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just all the fast, fun stuff I liked about Sonic, and I didn't get to see too much more than just what they had on demo, but I'm hoping that there's a multiplayer race, because you have first place, second place.

407
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:08,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume you can do more characters.

408
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:12,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it'd be sort of Sonic R, just on a side-scrolling level.

409
00:22:13,396 --> 00:22:14,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's pretty cool.

410
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:14,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki!

411
00:22:16,497 --> 00:22:24,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Dead Rising.

412
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:28,923
[SPEAKER_06]: That game is really fun.

413
00:22:29,644 --> 00:22:36,327
[SPEAKER_06]: You basically put in the Dawn of the Dead scenario with you can do anything.

414
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:39,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I was picking up pots, smashing the people.

415
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:41,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I ate a pie.

416
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:49,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I was playing around with the ServBot masks and stuck one on a zombie and smashed it with a sledgehammer.

417
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:55,021
[SPEAKER_06]: That game is going to be endless hours of fun for me.

418
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:58,344
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so gory, but really fun.

419
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm definitely getting it when it comes out.

420
00:23:02,587 --> 00:23:02,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

421
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:04,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, you got one more?

422
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:11,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, it's not as interesting as what everybody else played, because like I said, I didn't get to play the Wii, which is what I would be talking about.

423
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:15,400
[SPEAKER_08]: But we actually looked at the new .hack game.

424
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:17,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually thinking about that.

425
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:20,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the .hack, it's what, GU or something like that?

426
00:23:20,062 --> 00:23:20,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

427
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:20,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember what it was.

428
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:22,925
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Rebirth or something.

429
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:26,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, but it looks like it's going to be another episodic.

430
00:23:26,768 --> 00:23:29,931
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy that I talked to didn't know what price it was going to be or anything.

431
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:33,194
[SPEAKER_08]: But it looked more the same.

432
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:43,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, it did have a lot more animations and stuff, and I actually got the typical anime where it shows the three main characters in a split-screen view for half a second, then they all go crazy and everything goes red.

433
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,167
[SPEAKER_08]: But the demo, I wish it was longer.

434
00:23:46,787 --> 00:23:50,309
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

435
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:16,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, gosh, what should I do for my last interesting thing?

436
00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:18,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna say, uh, Phantasy Star Universe.

437
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:25,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Phantasy Star Universe, uh, I got to play it on PC, which looked superior to the PS2 one I saw.

438
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:25,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

439
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:32,417
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great because they didn't change a lot of the Phantasy Star online formula.

440
00:24:32,477 --> 00:24:34,398
[SPEAKER_07]: They just made it a little better.

441
00:24:35,378 --> 00:24:37,420
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do a little more super attacks.

442
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,082
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked like he had some more tactical points kind of thing.

443
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,284
[SPEAKER_07]: You can only do so many power hits in a row.

444
00:24:44,564 --> 00:24:46,485
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't just keep boring those power hits.

445
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:48,487
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can actually get in a fourth hit.

446
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:48,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

447
00:24:49,227 --> 00:24:53,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Phantasy Star Universe is going to be, if you guys are on Phantasy Star Online, it's going to be great for you guys.

448
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:58,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, the only disappointment I have with that is that they weren't showing the 360 version.

449
00:24:58,971 --> 00:25:00,452
[SPEAKER_07]: So that kind of made me a little sad.

450
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:04,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so I guess we all got our interesting things out.

451
00:25:04,526 --> 00:25:05,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a wacky question.

452
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:08,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we take calls?

453
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you can.

454
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we do calls?

455
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:09,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

456
00:25:09,931 --> 00:25:10,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Give out the number, Bobby.

457
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:13,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well you can either use... Do we have both Skype and the toll-free number?

458
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:17,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Give out the toll-free number, because you don't want to have to have all those people on Skype.

459
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:18,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

460
00:25:18,878 --> 00:25:20,019
[SPEAKER_08]: The toll-free number is 1-866-880-0156.

461
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:25,844
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a toll-free number here in the United States.

462
00:25:25,864 --> 00:25:26,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead and put that in chat.

463
00:25:26,744 --> 00:25:30,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Lawrence, one call at a time, though, because when we get like two people on the line, I get crazy.

464
00:25:30,748 --> 00:25:30,848
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

465
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:35,050
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, real quick, though, while we're waiting for some calls.

466
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:40,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Booth Babes, big controversy, and there really weren't a whole lot on the show for this year.

467
00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:44,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw some on that Final Fantasy, and I remember I turned to you and I'm like, $5,000?

468
00:25:45,437 --> 00:25:47,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they were Mithra girls, though.

469
00:25:47,098 --> 00:25:48,999
[SPEAKER_07]: They were more cosplayers than Booth Babes.

470
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,060
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

471
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the show different without Booth Babes?

472
00:25:52,122 --> 00:25:53,182
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't notice they weren't there.

473
00:25:53,683 --> 00:25:55,604
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't notice, nor did I miss, nor did I care.

474
00:25:56,818 --> 00:26:14,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really notice either, and I hope I don't come off sounding like the token gay guy of the show saying that, but I just... I really didn't change the show, because the show's about the games, not about that scenery, and people were going in to see the games anyway.

475
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,820
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?

476
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody had come up with a creative substitute for the booth babes.

477
00:26:18,221 --> 00:26:20,462
[SPEAKER_07]: What were you guys talking about in the bus?

478
00:26:20,522 --> 00:26:22,002
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about the Transformers.

479
00:26:22,022 --> 00:26:23,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that was Lawrence.

480
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:28,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's an Optimus Prime in one of the booths, and there's no Transformers game in there, but it got him in the booth.

481
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:31,565
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a banner for the Transformers movie.

482
00:26:32,485 --> 00:26:33,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, is that what it was?

483
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:33,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

484
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:34,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Savages.

485
00:26:35,626 --> 00:26:36,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Savages.

486
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:36,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Savages.

487
00:26:36,906 --> 00:26:37,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Bunch of Savages.

488
00:26:37,926 --> 00:26:38,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my game?

489
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:41,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

490
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,572
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a Transformers game and it wasn't very good.

491
00:26:43,592 --> 00:26:45,514
[SPEAKER_02]: They've done several and they've all been wrong.

492
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:48,474
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 3.

493
00:26:50,035 --> 00:26:52,995
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like we all got to play PlayStation 3 today.

494
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:57,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Did your impressions of the PlayStation 3 go up from the Sony conference?

495
00:26:58,236 --> 00:26:59,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you disappointed?

496
00:26:59,816 --> 00:27:00,376
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you think?

497
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:01,777
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, I'll go ahead and start with you.

498
00:27:02,057 --> 00:27:16,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I also played Gran Turismo HD and it was like another Gran Turismo and it was pretty but honestly I also saw that Heavenly Blade

499
00:27:17,878 --> 00:27:19,781
[SPEAKER_01]: My opinion still remains the same.

500
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:21,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony shot themselves... It's actually Heavenly Sword.

501
00:27:21,884 --> 00:27:22,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavenly Sword, sorry.

502
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:26,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking of Dancing Blade, which is another PlayStation game.

503
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:37,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think that they've shot themselves in the foot and this time with having not the best of games to show for it.

504
00:27:38,219 --> 00:27:39,240
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a caller on the line.

505
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

506
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:42,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Finish your thought, then I'll say hello to the caller.

507
00:27:43,064 --> 00:27:44,485
[SPEAKER_07]: It was crap then and crap now.

508
00:27:44,845 --> 00:27:46,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

509
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio live at the E3 Outpost.

510
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:49,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

511
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:52,426
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ichiban Crush!

512
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:56,728
[SPEAKER_07]: The Ichiban Crush, one of my very favorite posters on the forums.

513
00:27:57,768 --> 00:27:58,648
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

514
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:09,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, so, I'm looking at the E3 news on Monday and see the price announcement for PS3.

515
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:20,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help but wonder myself, man, but, I mean, I know this is Blu-ray and you're not going to, you just cannot get any cheaper than that, but is this thing really going to sell, yo?

516
00:28:21,161 --> 00:28:23,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, here's my thing with PlayStation 3.

517
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:31,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony has really yet to explain why their console is worth 200 more bucks than Xbox 360.

518
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:37,049
[SPEAKER_07]: And in playing the demos today, I mean, for instance, Sonic, Sonic is a game that's on Xbox 360.

519
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do I need to invest the extra money in the PlayStation 3?

520
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:41,932
[SPEAKER_07]: However, to PlayStation 3's credits...

521
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:46,095
[SPEAKER_07]: They do have a grip on some of the real great franchises.

522
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:50,700
[SPEAKER_07]: That Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer is, you know, fanboy, boner-inducing.

523
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:57,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XIII, I mean, you know, I'm a big Final Fantasy fan, so of course I'm like, oh, oh god.

524
00:28:57,406 --> 00:29:03,872
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, they've got games that I think are going to cater to the fanboys.

525
00:29:04,272 --> 00:29:07,575
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, but they're still, for the average gamer...

526
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:16,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft's in a great position right now because their system is cheaper and it's at glance right now seems to do the same thing as PlayStation 3.

527
00:29:16,903 --> 00:29:23,369
[SPEAKER_07]: What was missing from that conference for me was that Sony didn't tell me why I needed Blu-ray.

528
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody else have thoughts on that?

529
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:26,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know.

530
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:32,393
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually played Final Fantasy XII, and if that's any indication of what Final Fantasy XIII is going to be, then I'm better off without it.

531
00:29:32,953 --> 00:29:34,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Final Fantasy XII a whole lot.

532
00:29:34,953 --> 00:29:38,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy XII had the single worst combat system ever.

533
00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:41,935
[SPEAKER_01]: It took the stuff that was good about Grandia and made it crap.

534
00:29:41,995 --> 00:29:43,815
[SPEAKER_07]: We agree to disagree there, I suppose.

535
00:29:45,156 --> 00:29:46,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what was with that whole line business?

536
00:29:48,576 --> 00:29:50,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Xander C in chat doesn't like Microsoft.

537
00:29:50,557 --> 00:29:53,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Xander C says Microsoft has yet to show why their console is worth more than $150.

538
00:29:57,047 --> 00:30:02,150
[SPEAKER_07]: The stuff they're doing with Arcade and Gears of War is incredible.

539
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:05,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, I know how you feel.

540
00:30:05,893 --> 00:30:12,057
[SPEAKER_07]: If you had told me four years ago I would be here saying positive things about Microsoft, I would have said you're full of shit.

541
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we watching Lost Planet right now?

542
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:14,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is Lost Planet.

543
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:16,120
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks really good.

544
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,883
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one reason why this console is worth the money that it is.

545
00:30:21,443 --> 00:30:24,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Lost Planet right here, Capcom really has

546
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be honest with you, Sky

547
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:55,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really, really worried about this whole upcoming next gen, just mainly because of Sony.

548
00:30:55,967 --> 00:31:03,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's going to cause another crash like everyone's been saying for the past two decades, but

549
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:05,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

550
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not feeling it this time around.

551
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:11,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the way I was with the 16-bit, 32-bit eras.

552
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:23,814
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's a different battle this time because the battle is not just about the games, but it's about getting that console in your living room so you can get the music and the on-demand movies and all this other stuff.

553
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:26,396
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a factor that we've never had to really deal with before.

554
00:31:26,836 --> 00:31:29,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's kind of what makes a lot of this very interesting.

555
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:30,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

556
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:31,582
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, you're right.

557
00:31:32,285 --> 00:31:34,976
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is too hard to tell because look at Japan.

558
00:31:36,547 --> 00:31:38,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox has really yet to catch on there.

559
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:42,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it going to catch wildfire after E3?

560
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:42,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

561
00:31:42,872 --> 00:31:44,734
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard for me to say.

562
00:31:45,894 --> 00:31:50,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what would be most interesting about this is if Microsoft ends up on top here in the U.S.

563
00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:52,680
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I'm purely speculating, guys.

564
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Please don't take this as my opinion on what's going to happen or whatever.

565
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:57,323
[SPEAKER_07]: But what if Microsoft's on top here in the U.S.

566
00:31:57,363 --> 00:31:59,265
[SPEAKER_07]: and then Sony's on top in Japan?

567
00:31:59,525 --> 00:32:00,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't that be something?

568
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:01,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

569
00:32:01,614 --> 00:32:05,237
[SPEAKER_07]: That means that we're still going to get another crappy PlayStation later on.

570
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope Sony's taking the feedback.

571
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,963
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like they did it before when everybody bitched about the Boomerang controller.

572
00:32:14,003 --> 00:32:16,664
[SPEAKER_07]: They went back and changed it, so hopefully Sony's listening this time.

573
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:17,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

574
00:32:17,945 --> 00:32:19,907
[SPEAKER_07]: The boomerang just looks uncomfortable.

575
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:23,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a controller that likes the boomerang.

576
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:25,050
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not good.

577
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:29,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Ichimon Crush, you know I love you, but I gotta let you go so we can get more cars in, alright?

578
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:30,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

579
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:31,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, guys.

580
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:32,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for calling.

581
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:33,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all have a good one.

582
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:34,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, you too.

583
00:32:35,232 --> 00:32:43,076
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I want to add before he called was about, you were talking about Gran Turismo, and a lot of people probably looked at the demo and they're like, oh, that's so cool, the people move.

584
00:32:43,356 --> 00:32:46,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm going to tell you right now, they are still 2D paper people.

585
00:32:47,318 --> 00:32:57,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I looked, and, you know, the people, because that's one of the things a lot of people have about the Gran Turismo series is that the people look like they're like 2D pieces of paper, and they still are in that early demo.

586
00:32:57,862 --> 00:32:58,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen.

587
00:32:58,703 --> 00:33:01,084
[SPEAKER_01]: I played the Tokyo track, and it... I'm gonna...

[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

590
00:33:27,144 --> 00:33:27,624
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on?

591
00:33:27,664 --> 00:33:28,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the weather nuts or something?

592
00:33:29,685 --> 00:33:32,146
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been kind of hot.

593
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,727
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been kind of hot recently.

594
00:33:36,387 --> 00:33:37,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, tell us about E3.

595
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:39,208
[SPEAKER_07]: What are your thoughts on E3 so far?

596
00:33:40,508 --> 00:33:47,470
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing that caught my attention actually was in Nintendo's press conference when they were showing the CS game, they showed Diddy Kong Racing.

597
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:51,992
[SPEAKER_04]: They happened to show Snowball Valley from the original on there, which was interesting.

598
00:33:53,645 --> 00:34:01,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I... You've got a good eye, because honestly, I was one of those people that didn't really care about Diddy Kong Racing because I was too distracted by the thoughts of Star Fox on the DS.

599
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they kind of showed that all at once, and I was like, ooh, Star Fox!

600
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:06,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, fuck Diddy Kong, I want Star Fox!

601
00:34:07,073 --> 00:34:08,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Diddy Kong Racing sucked anyways.

602
00:34:09,654 --> 00:34:12,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's... No, this is Nintendo Maniac, so he might have a different opinion.

603
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:14,037
[SPEAKER_07]: So... Alright.

604
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:16,378
[SPEAKER_07]: You got any questions for us, Nintendo Maniac?

605
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... Um...

606
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:27,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, um, you... Oh, you know what, never mind on that question.

607
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:28,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

608
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:28,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

609
00:34:28,728 --> 00:34:30,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, is there anything else?

610
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:34,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, how long did you have to wait to get to play Twilight Princess?

611
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:35,754
[SPEAKER_07]: To get to play what?

612
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,257
[SPEAKER_04]: To get to play Twilight Princess.

613
00:34:39,017 --> 00:34:40,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't... Twilight Princess.

614
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:43,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Twilight Princess, uh... Um, I waited about 30 to 45 minutes.

615
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:46,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

616
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:10,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, see, it takes about an hour to two and a half hours from what they told me to get into the Wii area.

617
00:35:11,493 --> 00:35:13,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you've got to wait behind people.

618
00:35:13,674 --> 00:35:15,175
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just normal kiosk once you get in there.

619
00:35:16,555 --> 00:35:18,616
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Nintendo Maniacs64, thanks so much for the call.

620
00:35:18,636 --> 00:35:19,956
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go ahead and let you go, buddy, okay?

621
00:35:20,436 --> 00:35:20,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

622
00:35:20,737 --> 00:35:21,497
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, have a good one.

623
00:35:22,217 --> 00:35:24,258
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're going to take one more call.

624
00:35:24,318 --> 00:35:25,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see who we got.

625
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Lawrence Young, the man on the controls.

626
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

627
00:35:30,984 --> 00:35:32,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

628
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:35,366
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt, what's on your mind, buddy?

629
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:36,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the call.

630
00:35:36,106 --> 00:35:36,546
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on?

631
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:42,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I was wondering what you guys thought of the new test, the new test numbers on SSJ100.

632
00:35:43,276 --> 00:35:44,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Smash Bros.

633
00:36:12,956 --> 00:36:14,657
[SPEAKER_06]: from Metal Gear Solid.

634
00:36:14,877 --> 00:36:15,997
[SPEAKER_06]: That is crazy.

635
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:17,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Pit from Kid Icarus.

636
00:36:17,578 --> 00:36:19,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

637
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:26,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo, thank you for finally fucking acknowledging this game you've ignored for the past like 20 years.

638
00:36:27,276 --> 00:36:30,097
[SPEAKER_06]: You have Wario as going to be another one.

639
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:32,658
[SPEAKER_06]: And also Zero Suit Samus.

640
00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:34,398
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty hot.

641
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was pretty interesting.

642
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:37,459
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was one more.

643
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:40,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say... Oh, God.

644
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:41,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

645
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Some metal robot thing.

646
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:49,062
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of the very interesting things that's on here, they show one of the attacks.

647
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:50,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's one of the attacks?

648
00:36:50,603 --> 00:36:52,683
[SPEAKER_06]: But a Nintendog licking the screen.

649
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:53,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Jesus.

650
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:54,004
[SPEAKER_06]: He's so puppy.

651
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,681
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys.

652
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:56,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Snake has his box.

653
00:36:56,983 --> 00:36:57,284
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

654
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:58,827
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

655
00:36:58,987 --> 00:37:01,832
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100, Matt, we've got to wrap up, but thanks so much for the call, all right?

656
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:03,235
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

657
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:03,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one, buddy.

658
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:04,296
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

659
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:07,673
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's going to be our last call for the night.

660
00:37:07,713 --> 00:37:12,355
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to wrap up so that we can get out of here so all games interactive can take over for a little bit.

661
00:37:13,256 --> 00:37:15,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, I'm getting the stretch it out sign.

662
00:37:16,298 --> 00:37:17,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, never mind then, we won't.

663
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:25,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Comments from chat room, Boss Tone, Toshin, they all want to know, Dance Dance TV, what the hell do we think of this?

664
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,184
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys didn't hear...

665
00:37:27,924 --> 00:37:28,324
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?

666
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, because I was reading about this late last night.

667
00:37:31,588 --> 00:37:35,411
[SPEAKER_07]: CBS Television is optioned Dance Dance TV, right?

668
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:35,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

669
00:37:36,112 --> 00:37:41,838
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dance Dance TV is going to be a show that's going to be, what, the Saturday morning slumber party on CBS or something like that?

670
00:37:42,638 --> 00:37:47,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, and I'm kind of afraid to even consider wanting to know.

671
00:37:47,523 --> 00:37:57,000
[SPEAKER_07]: What I picked up on it is that it's like it's supposed to be teams of kids competing against each other and it's inspired by DDR or something like that.

672
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,623
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what guys?

673
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,884
[SPEAKER_07]: From Konami's perspective, it's all about whatever's gonna sell more games, right?

674
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:08,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see this as a bad thing.

675
00:38:08,406 --> 00:38:09,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I gonna watch it?

676
00:38:09,806 --> 00:38:10,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck no.

677
00:38:10,847 --> 00:38:13,849
[SPEAKER_07]: But am I gonna hate it just because it's out there?

678
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:14,390
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

679
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand we gotta do crazy things to promote our stuff sometimes.

680
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:22,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's a bad thing, and I don't think it's gonna make DDR look stupid because...

681
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:35,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, if somebody were to come up to me and tell me, dude, you're playing that DDR game that's on a little girl's morning TV show, I would say, dude, you were watching Saturday morning TV for little girls.

682
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:38,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

683
00:38:39,044 --> 00:38:39,804
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks stupid.

684
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:44,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not watching it, but I don't know.

685
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:49,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Xander C in chatroom says they're a little late to be making a DDR TV show.

686
00:38:49,389 --> 00:38:51,150
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have tried that back in 2002.

687
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember DDR the movie?

688
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:56,740
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

689
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,351
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

690
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:44,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this, I was a little surprised that the games that are on it, they have the NES versions of the games.

691
00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:53,604
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the Nintendo version of Strider, which was, I don't like it, because it's that whole story thing based off of the old Strider manga that was out a few years ago.

692
00:39:54,404 --> 00:39:54,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

693
00:39:55,365 --> 00:40:10,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I would much rather have them do, like, you know, a Mega Drive collection where we have, you know, like, the actual Arcade Strider and, you know, actual Arcade Final Fight in this, you know, because the PSP could easily do it, but these are Nintendo... This is going to be random, but I forgot to tell you, Strider's on GameCapt now.

694
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:12,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I need that.

695
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty hot, huh?

696
00:40:13,874 --> 00:40:15,255
[SPEAKER_06]: You told me yesterday.

697
00:40:15,335 --> 00:40:25,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Jamie, did you see that they had that Capcom Classic Collection Mini that's going to be on the Game Boy Advance, which has Strider and Bionic Commando?

698
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other game that was on the PSP thing was Bionic Commando.

699
00:40:30,643 --> 00:40:31,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

700
00:40:31,683 --> 00:40:37,526
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I love Mighty Final Fight, but I have that on Nintendo.

701
00:40:37,847 --> 00:40:39,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I have all those on Nintendo.

702
00:40:39,027 --> 00:40:40,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just play them on Nintendo.

703
00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:41,922
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

704
00:40:58,084 --> 00:41:01,927
[SPEAKER_01]: around Capcom and Sega and Namco, Bondi tomorrow.

705
00:41:01,987 --> 00:41:02,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

706
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:04,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to chat room for some comments here.

707
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:10,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Rockus, OLRRockus wants to know in chat.allgames.com, song list updates for the DDRs, anyone?

708
00:41:11,173 --> 00:41:15,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I'm going to be honest with you, check DDRFreak.com or BomaniStyle.com, I'm sure they have it up.

709
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:28,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I played Precious, some remix of Precious by Depeche Mode in the Universe one, and I played Listen to Your Heart in Ultramix 4, and I played Since You've Been Gone on Supernova.

710
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:34,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I did get to play Seduction in the vocal mix now, which is in Supernova in the arcade.

711
00:41:34,393 --> 00:41:34,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.

712
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I did want to issue a challenge.

713
00:41:37,587 --> 00:41:37,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

714
00:41:38,308 --> 00:41:45,393
[SPEAKER_01]: If any of our listeners are at E3, I would love to meet people up at SNK to own them on King of Fighters 2006.

715
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

716
00:41:48,415 --> 00:41:50,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Quick programming note, just for people here on the live stream.

717
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:52,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to you podcast folks who are here.

718
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:53,098
[SPEAKER_08]: That's alright.

719

[SPEAKER_08]: All Games Interactive will be going on after Gamer Andy.

[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:03,825
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm letting them know at the same time instead of trying to whisper in their ear.

724
00:42:04,385 --> 00:42:26,384
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, but Gamer Andy, live from the Microsoft Press Conference at 8.15 And then All Games Interactive at 9.30 when they get kicked out of the Microsoft Press Conference So don't worry about ending right now, you've got a little while longer If you want to take more calls, that's cool Alright, maybe we'll do more calls in a little bit For right now though, let's finish up this thought we were going down Something you want to look at tomorrow Loki, what are you going to be doing tomorrow?

725
00:42:27,304 --> 00:42:32,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I will probably be hitting up the Sony booth because I was mainly in South Hall today.

726
00:42:33,486 --> 00:42:35,026
[SPEAKER_06]: So I need to hit up West Hall.

727
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:39,127
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still parts of South Hall that I haven't seen so I might need to go back there.

728
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:42,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually hit up a lot of the Korean booths today.

729
00:42:43,248 --> 00:42:44,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I think just because I was that bored.

730
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:47,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

731
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:49,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably just hitting up...

732
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:53,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the games I haven't played for Sony, just trying all the new ones.

733
00:42:54,492 --> 00:43:00,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe trying Nintendo again to see if I can try playing Metroid Prime 3 or something like that.

734
00:43:02,795 --> 00:43:03,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, I don't know.

735
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:05,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I've got to check out the PSP stuff, definitely.

736
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:09,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I didn't do that either.

737
00:43:10,118 --> 00:43:12,359
[SPEAKER_07]: We got the call sign, so let's go to the phones.

738
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:14,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

739
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

740
00:43:16,257 --> 00:43:17,577
[SPEAKER_05]: This is SilentWind96.

741
00:43:18,077 --> 00:43:19,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, SilentWind96.

742
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:20,278
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

743
00:43:21,638 --> 00:43:23,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just chilling here.

744
00:43:23,418 --> 00:43:25,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm down the street in my hotel.

745
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:30,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on down.

746
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't get a pass.

747
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't get a temporary job at EB Games or nothing so I could get into this joint.

748
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:38,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait.

749
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:39,982
[SPEAKER_07]: You couldn't get into E3 at all?

750
00:43:41,414 --> 00:43:45,564
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't have any credentials to get in, so I couldn't really... No, come to the outpost.

751
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:45,904
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

752
00:43:45,985 --> 00:43:48,029
[SPEAKER_07]: At the outpost, you don't need a credential.

753
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:48,811
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get in here.

754
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:50,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

755
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,622
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you what, you know what?

756
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:54,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get you in.

757
00:43:54,323 --> 00:43:56,625
[SPEAKER_07]: We will get you in this place for free, right?

758
00:43:56,645 --> 00:43:57,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we do that?

759
00:43:57,745 --> 00:43:57,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

760
00:43:57,886 --> 00:43:58,106
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

761
00:43:58,146 --> 00:43:58,866
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll get in our meeting.

762
00:43:58,926 --> 00:44:00,307
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

763
00:44:00,327 --> 00:44:04,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Does he have a... Can you send somebody... How do we get him in touch with us?

764
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, you're in chat, so you just PM me your name.

765
00:44:06,832 --> 00:44:10,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I want you to send a private message to BlackWolf, and he'll get you in touch.

766
00:44:10,495 --> 00:44:10,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

767
00:44:10,635 --> 00:44:11,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Get on down here.

768
00:44:11,376 --> 00:44:12,757
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get in this place, at least.

769
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:14,881
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

770
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:16,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions you want to know about?

771
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:18,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so sorry to hear you didn't get in.

772
00:44:18,362 --> 00:44:21,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything you want to mention about the show?

773
00:44:23,084 --> 00:44:27,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first of all, I love the show, guys.

774
00:44:27,626 --> 00:44:31,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a crappy internet connection here at the hotel, but I can at least hear the stream.

775
00:44:31,948 --> 00:44:35,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

776
00:44:36,851 --> 00:44:41,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a DS Lite I imported recently, and I'm loving it.

777
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,141
[SPEAKER_07]: How is that?

778
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,103
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

779
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:49,425
[SPEAKER_07]: What makes it so much better than the original DS?

780
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:56,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've never touched the original DS, so I like this, and it looked really cool.

781
00:44:56,851 --> 00:45:04,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I found it on eBay, and I blew away Scott and Lawrence, and I told them I got it for $99 off of eBay.

782
00:45:05,317 --> 00:45:05,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

783
00:45:06,258 --> 00:45:09,220
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually had this for their demo units for...

784
00:45:10,968 --> 00:45:17,076
[SPEAKER_01]: It was some really awful card game, but I have to say that I enjoyed the brighter screen on it.

785
00:45:17,937 --> 00:45:19,299
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt a little bit easier.

786
00:45:20,472 --> 00:45:21,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's right.

787
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:21,953
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

788
00:45:22,273 --> 00:45:25,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, SilentWind96, we'll see you in a little bit.

789
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:28,618
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're getting the hookup, man, because this is an invite-only party tonight here.

790
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:29,538
[SPEAKER_07]: In television.

791
00:45:29,919 --> 00:45:33,061
[SPEAKER_07]: The Mario Rock Opera is... Mario Rock Opera is setting up.

792
00:45:33,081 --> 00:45:35,303
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got a whole DJ thing down there.

793
00:45:35,323 --> 00:45:36,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Supernova Sound.

794
00:45:37,204 --> 00:45:39,846
[SPEAKER_07]: In television everywhere, but there's new stuff too.

795
00:45:39,926 --> 00:45:42,087
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, who doesn't love these classics?

796
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:42,528
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

797
00:45:42,728 --> 00:45:43,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your butt down here right now.

798
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:45,329
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-866-880-0156 1-866-880-0156

799
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:09,330
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't call in asking to get in free tonight because we just gave our one away.

800
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,390
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's it.

801
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:10,971
[SPEAKER_07]: We're done.

802
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:12,811
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the good news.

803
00:46:12,851 --> 00:46:18,212
[SPEAKER_07]: You can come Thursday or Friday and you can get in and it's a good time.

804
00:46:18,352 --> 00:46:22,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you still want to come down, Thursday and Friday we'll be here as well because we're taping both nights.

805
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:23,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do we leave off?

806
00:46:24,614 --> 00:46:27,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby, oh, Bobby's on the phone, so I'll go.

807
00:46:27,276 --> 00:46:28,878
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I want to see tomorrow.

808
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:33,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't freaking touch the Wii, so I guess I'm going to have to wait in that.

809
00:46:33,361 --> 00:46:34,342
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to touch the Wii?

810
00:46:34,422 --> 00:46:37,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to touch Nintendo's Wii so bad.

811
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:41,448
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to wait in that horrible line and just...

812
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:46,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it over with so I can say I played the damn Wii so I can come here and tell you all about it.

813
00:46:46,149 --> 00:46:48,170
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's essentially my day.

814
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:51,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I didn't see anything in West Hall besides Sony.

815
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:55,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know Tecmo's over there, and I know there's other booths over there I want to check out.

816
00:46:56,533 --> 00:47:05,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I would suggest going by Atlas for Disgaea 2 and Kalei, of course, for Guitar Man Lives.

817
00:47:05,616 --> 00:47:07,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to play their Fatal Inertia also.

818
00:47:07,596 --> 00:47:09,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

819
00:47:09,517 --> 00:47:09,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

820
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:14,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, I'm going to go over to chat here and see what's going on here.

821
00:47:14,272 --> 00:47:18,817
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw wants to know, are we going to be able to hear the Mario Rock Opera tonight as well?

822
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:23,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I think unfortunately they don't because GamerAndy is going to be live somewhere else right at that moment, right?

823
00:47:24,122 --> 00:47:25,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that was what that phone call was.

824
00:47:26,124 --> 00:47:26,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

825
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:28,226
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to be live.

826
00:47:28,306 --> 00:47:30,728
[SPEAKER_08]: They cannot get it to work on Microsoft servers.

827
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:31,749
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to still record.

828
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize to all of GamerAndy's fans in chat.

829
00:47:34,192 --> 00:47:34,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh!

830
00:47:34,572 --> 00:47:37,234
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some in there, so all games interactive will be going on.

831
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:40,395
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll still have the show up on their podcast feed.

832
00:47:40,515 --> 00:47:43,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay, so the GamerAndy fans still have that.

833
00:47:43,217 --> 00:47:45,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and GamerAndy will be here tomorrow night.

834
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice guy, GamerAndy, and he's got quite a clique.

835
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:51,361
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got eight people.

836
00:47:51,422 --> 00:47:52,882
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a huge entourage.

837
00:47:53,022 --> 00:47:56,164
[SPEAKER_08]: GamerAndy.com And they've got the hookup.

838
00:47:56,184 --> 00:47:57,025
[SPEAKER_08]: They play Gears of War.

839
00:47:57,825 --> 00:48:02,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking to Andy because they got behind closed doors at Microsoft and they played Gears of War and they said it was awesome.

840
00:48:02,808 --> 00:48:04,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there when they were getting it.

841
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:05,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

842
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:06,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Major Nelson's on their show tonight, right?

843
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe so, yeah.

844
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:12,493
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were trying to rig it to get it to work and they just can't get it to work on their Wi-Fi over there.

845
00:48:12,513 --> 00:48:13,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Frickin' technology.

846
00:48:13,713 --> 00:48:13,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

847
00:48:14,134 --> 00:48:14,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

848
00:48:15,194 --> 00:48:17,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby, what are you looking forward to doing tomorrow at the show?

849
00:48:17,656 --> 00:48:17,776
[SPEAKER_07]: We...

850
00:48:19,517 --> 00:48:19,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Wee, that's all.

851
00:48:20,298 --> 00:48:21,999
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to go wee, wee, wee all the way home?

852
00:48:22,339 --> 00:48:23,400
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just in the morning.

853
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Just going to go over there and wait, whatever, the two hours.

854
00:48:25,582 --> 00:48:27,343
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to go over and wee in West Hall in the morning?

855
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:27,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

856
00:48:27,683 --> 00:48:28,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, yeah.

857
00:48:28,184 --> 00:48:29,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm going directly there.

858
00:48:29,305 --> 00:48:31,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Right in the center of Nintendo's booth, I'm going to wee.

859
00:48:31,646 --> 00:48:33,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm going to go play with my wee.

860
00:48:33,588 --> 00:48:35,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I really want to play the conducting game.

861
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,752
[SPEAKER_08]: And that drum demo, you know, the virtual drum.

862
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:42,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, I mean, I'm a musician, and I want to see if I'm any better at Miyamoto.

863
00:48:43,155 --> 00:48:44,075
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura wants to address chat.

864
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,144
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't look too deep into the DS area, honestly.

865
00:49:13,645 --> 00:49:17,189
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will go hunt out anything on Fire Emblem tomorrow I can.

866
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:19,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I know lots of people are interested in that series.

867
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:20,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the series.

868
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:21,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't play it for crap, but I love the series.

869
00:49:22,316 --> 00:49:24,679
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will look up Fire Emblem stuff for y'all tomorrow.

870
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:32,126
[SPEAKER_07]: HitStun in chat right now is questioning is Super Smash Bros.

871
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:35,827
[SPEAKER_07]: this new one a real game or was it just a whole fan service thing?

872
00:49:36,127 --> 00:49:38,028
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they have pictures from the conference.

873
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:39,988
[SPEAKER_06]: With Miyamoto in the pictures?

874
00:49:40,008 --> 00:49:41,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would think it's real.

875
00:49:41,649 --> 00:49:43,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

876
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:46,130
[SPEAKER_07]: They say it in chat, I say it out loud.

877
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:46,890
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's what we do.

878
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:52,672
[SPEAKER_06]: They even have this cool little montage where Snake is talking to Ocelot or whatever, you know, whatever his name is.

879
00:49:52,832 --> 00:49:53,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Otacon.

880
00:49:53,572 --> 00:49:53,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Otacon.

881
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:57,653
[SPEAKER_06]: See, listen, I don't play Metal Gear Solid, so that's why I'm going to butcher everything.

882
00:49:57,913 --> 00:50:03,016
[SPEAKER_06]: All I know is it's a game by a guy named Solid Snake, and that's as far as I go.

883
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:08,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Folks in chat want to know about Excite Truck.

884
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:09,840
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys saw it, I didn't.

885
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,061
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about Excite Truck?

886
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:12,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I want that game.

887
00:50:12,862 --> 00:50:16,584
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it scores like Burnout.

888
00:50:16,724 --> 00:50:17,825
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very interesting.

889
00:50:17,905 --> 00:50:21,867
[SPEAKER_06]: The truck is extremely fast, so it's kind of like Excite Bike a little bit.

890
00:50:23,368 --> 00:50:24,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Just very interesting.

891
00:50:24,969 --> 00:50:29,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, no one seemed to be able to keep their truck on the road, but it looked fun.

892
00:50:30,073 --> 00:50:31,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the way they do their scoring system.

893
00:50:31,634 --> 00:50:39,340
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like Burnout, where you get points for, you know, driving dangerously, catching a lot of air, going fast, being in first place, and that stuff.

894
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:46,325
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll give you a ranking on the race, everything from, like, D to AAA, S, I don't know.

895
00:50:46,886 --> 00:50:50,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did say, though, that it wasn't, you weren't going to be able to do anything online with it.

896
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:52,670
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of dumb.

897
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:58,180
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping that they have the whole, you know, build a level, save it, take it to your friend's house.

898
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo needs to do online, dammit.

899
00:51:00,721 --> 00:51:01,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Get with the program.

900
00:51:03,864 --> 00:51:13,131
[SPEAKER_06]: They did have Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam there, and I didn't get to play that, or Tony Hawk's Project 8, which I have no idea what the hell Project 8 is, but, um, I don't know.

901
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:14,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be good.

902
00:51:15,112 --> 00:51:21,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Project Hammer was another game that they had at the Wii booths, and, um,

903
00:51:23,629 --> 00:51:25,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not very interested in that game, to be honest.

904
00:51:27,114 --> 00:51:28,055
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a Sonic game, though.

905
00:51:28,676 --> 00:51:30,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic, uh... What was it?

906
00:51:31,179 --> 00:51:31,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Wildfire?

907
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:33,222
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?

908
00:51:34,143 --> 00:51:34,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play it.

909
00:51:34,623 --> 00:51:35,565
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked good, though.

910
00:51:35,965 --> 00:51:38,368
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it?

911
00:51:38,568 --> 00:51:39,249
[SPEAKER_06]: They had Bomberman.

912
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:42,592
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Virtual Console.

913
00:51:42,952 --> 00:51:43,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Monkey Ball.

914
00:51:43,813 --> 00:51:44,953
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the Virtual Console.

915
00:51:45,013 --> 00:51:46,815
[SPEAKER_07]: The Virtual Console is sexy.

916
00:51:46,855 --> 00:51:48,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see it all.

917
00:51:48,135 --> 00:51:49,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me about Mario World.

918
00:51:49,496 --> 00:51:50,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me about it.

919
00:51:50,597 --> 00:51:51,177
[SPEAKER_07]: How did it work?

920
00:51:51,197 --> 00:51:51,718
[SPEAKER_07]: How does it look?

921
00:51:52,098 --> 00:51:56,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I didn't get to check it out because I was feeling a little ill at the moment.

922
00:51:57,181 --> 00:52:01,424
[SPEAKER_06]: We will have hopefully some pictures online soon of the Virtual Console.

923
00:52:01,864 --> 00:52:10,110
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the meantime, if you are really trying to get a look at it, I believe Joystick had pictures of it online.

924
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:12,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm trying to find the link so we can put it in chat.

925
00:52:14,804 --> 00:52:15,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked pretty cool.

926
00:52:15,805 --> 00:52:20,650
[SPEAKER_06]: They had on demo, they actually had the Super Mario Bros.

927
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:21,991
[SPEAKER_06]: for the Nintendo.

928
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:33,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64, Bong for the TurboGrafx, Sonic for the Genesis, of course, and Super Nintendo.

929
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:34,742
[SPEAKER_02]: They had Super Mario World.

930
00:52:35,043 --> 00:52:35,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario World.

931
00:52:36,004 --> 00:52:38,726
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely really cool looking.

932
00:52:41,028 --> 00:52:44,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it looks very solid, very sexy, very white.

933
00:52:48,737 --> 00:52:55,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, obviously this is not really great radio, but Rob, here's pictures of the virtual console on my laptop here.

934
00:52:56,005 --> 00:52:56,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's pretty hot.

935
00:52:56,927 --> 00:52:57,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

936
00:52:57,327 --> 00:52:58,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I do like that.

937
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:00,211
[SPEAKER_07]: It's bigger than I thought.

938
00:53:00,271 --> 00:53:02,374
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on Engadget, guys, if you want to go there.

939
00:53:02,454 --> 00:53:04,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it would have more games on the screen at once.

940
00:53:04,777 --> 00:53:05,578
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of interesting.

941
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

942
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:08,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Real quick plug for the websites.

943
00:53:09,043 --> 00:53:10,265
[SPEAKER_07]: E3 on PSP.com.

944
00:53:10,305 --> 00:53:12,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you've been updating that like a mofo, right?

945
00:53:12,528 --> 00:53:12,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

946
00:53:12,748 --> 00:53:13,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been trying.

947
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:14,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been getting behind a little bit.

948
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:20,094
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do have some stuff from actually the Nintendo party that I attended.

949
00:53:20,775 --> 00:53:20,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh!

950
00:53:21,295 --> 00:53:22,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Which should be good.

951
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:24,137
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got some pictures of that.

952
00:53:24,397 --> 00:53:25,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's come back to that in a minute.

953
00:53:25,899 --> 00:53:27,900
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what sites have you been working on?

954
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:33,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I did a little blogging today on stuff.orangenilderadio.com.

955
00:53:33,945 --> 00:53:36,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have a backlog I'm going to post there soon, too.

956
00:53:37,128 --> 00:53:41,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I just happened to go up to the press room just to relax for a little bit and...

957
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:46,930
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured I'd go ahead and update the stuff blog, so there's my initial impressions there.

958
00:53:46,991 --> 00:53:57,022
[SPEAKER_01]: That was everything up until I headed back, actually right before I ran into you guys, when I was coming out of the west.

959
00:53:57,243 --> 00:53:58,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry I'm all backwards today.

960
00:53:58,524 --> 00:53:58,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

961
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:07,195
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if you want to check out just what my impression was as of that moment, I have a few details there.

962
00:54:07,555 --> 00:54:10,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I had just also checked out Guitar Room Man at that point.

963
00:54:11,479 --> 00:54:19,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's a discussion going on in our LiveJournal community at...

964
00:54:20,527 --> 00:54:23,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Challenge.livejournal.com You can get there.

965
00:54:24,809 --> 00:54:26,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's stuff going up on our MySpace.

966
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:30,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't looked at MySpace all week.

967
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:34,992
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's various other discussions that we're involved with at different locations.

968
00:54:35,012 --> 00:54:35,693
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on...

969
00:54:36,843 --> 00:54:37,484
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next time.

970
00:54:54,904 --> 00:54:58,546
[SPEAKER_08]: with G4 interviewing somebody in Kensho.

971
00:54:58,886 --> 00:55:02,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're like, is he that desperate for a paycheck?

972
00:55:02,527 --> 00:55:03,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I just rolled my eyes.

973
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:04,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like, I don't get it.

974
00:55:04,748 --> 00:55:06,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't get G4 anymore, so whatever.

975
00:55:06,529 --> 00:55:07,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw him in South Hall.

976
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,771
[SPEAKER_06]: They were making him record, I guess, a bumper or something.

977
00:55:10,931 --> 00:55:12,511
[SPEAKER_06]: He's all, I'm here at E3, man.

978
00:55:12,591 --> 00:55:15,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I was supposed to be in Alaska or something like that.

979
00:55:15,293 --> 00:55:17,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, okay.

980
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:22,936
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing I saw him do that wasn't an animated movie was USA Up All Night.

981
00:55:25,256 --> 00:55:26,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other celebrity signings?

982
00:55:26,617 --> 00:55:30,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if this counts, but I got to meet Tommy Tallarico, thanks to Bobby.

983
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:34,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And Becky Young, who's smoking.

984
00:55:35,282 --> 00:55:38,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice guy, but he had so much makeup on because he was doing the HD TV play.

985
00:55:38,785 --> 00:55:42,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he did the HD, which is on VOOM, Dish Network.

986
00:55:42,287 --> 00:55:45,729
[SPEAKER_07]: He looked like, who's that guy on Dancing with the Stars?

987
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:47,030
[SPEAKER_07]: George Hamilton?

988
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:48,809
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm teasing.

989
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:50,410
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a very nice... I'm totally teasing.

990
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:51,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice guy.

991
00:55:52,072 --> 00:55:54,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Glad to meet him.

992
00:55:54,215 --> 00:55:55,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other celebrity run-ins, you guys?

993
00:55:56,357 --> 00:56:00,481
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to meet... Well, I didn't get to meet him, but I saw the guy who worked on the...

994
00:56:02,603 --> 00:56:17,112
[SPEAKER_01]: DS, Castlemania Games, and then, as I'm actually showing Rob my picture right now, I had my meeting, well, not necessarily that I actually got to meet him other than to say thank you, but Koji Kondo, I got his autograph.

995
00:56:17,892 --> 00:56:27,018
[SPEAKER_01]: And I happened to be at the press line for Nintendo when they were doing an interview with Miyamoto.

996
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,255
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got a lot of great pictures there, DarkSakura.

997
00:56:30,275 --> 00:56:31,576
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to get those on the site soon.

998
00:56:32,176 --> 00:56:37,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't figured out how to... Because I'm actually using my... No, no, no, I don't want to do that.

999
00:56:38,059 --> 00:56:41,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually using my camcorder as a camera, too.

1000
00:56:42,061 --> 00:56:43,902
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to get the picture to show Rob.

1001
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:44,263
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.

1002
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:49,087
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a really good picture of Miyamoto.

1003
00:57:03,345 --> 00:57:07,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Go into chat room, chat.allgames.com for this week while we're live at the E3 Outpost.

1004
00:57:08,067 --> 00:57:11,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Xander wants to know, did we see In The Groove 2 consumer style?

1005
00:57:12,649 --> 00:57:15,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Conspicuously absent from Red Octane's booth completely.

1006
00:57:16,871 --> 00:57:18,391
[SPEAKER_07]: All they have is Guitar Hero 2.

1007
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:23,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you this, their booth is 50 times better than it was last year, but it's all Guitar Hero 2.

1008
00:57:23,834 --> 00:57:26,295
[SPEAKER_07]: They are not showing In The Groove in any capacity.

1009
00:57:26,315 --> 00:57:29,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't hear anything about the Activision deal either.

1010
00:57:29,676 --> 00:57:30,296
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1011
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:30,996
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to hear us?

1012
00:57:31,457 --> 00:57:34,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I overheard Activision people talking about the acquisition.

1013
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:38,699
[SPEAKER_07]: As I was walking out of Kensha, I overheard Activision people talking about it.

1014
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:42,520
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were just saying, they were just very happy about it.

1015
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:47,442
[SPEAKER_07]: They were like, well, I'm glad we got them because someone was going to eventually, you know, it was basically the tone of the whole thing.

1016
00:57:47,482 --> 00:57:50,223
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if I was supposed to hear that, but I did.

1017
00:57:50,363 --> 00:57:52,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Activision's very happy to be getting Red Octane, so...

1018
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:55,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

1019
00:57:55,474 --> 00:57:56,274
[SPEAKER_01]: The puppies.

1020
00:57:56,314 --> 00:57:59,616
[SPEAKER_01]: The puppies on IGN.com from Smash Brothers.

1021
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:00,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my lord.

1022
00:58:01,097 --> 00:58:06,100
[SPEAKER_01]: But I lost my train of thought.

1023
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:06,741
[SPEAKER_01]: It's alright.

1024
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:09,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn you for distracting me with puppy.

1025
00:58:09,931 --> 00:58:10,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1026
00:58:10,591 --> 00:58:13,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a quick programming note for those that are listening live.

1027
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:22,097
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're tuning in right now because you're expecting to hear Gamer Andy, unfortunately they're having technical difficulties, will not be able to do a live broadcast tonight.

1028
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:26,319
[SPEAKER_07]: He will be doing a podcast on his normal podcast stream.

1029
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:27,820
[SPEAKER_07]: So check that out.

1030
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:32,943
[SPEAKER_07]: However, All Games Interactive will be here live right after we wrap up in just a few minutes here.

1031
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:35,004
[SPEAKER_07]: And there might be OLR people on that too.

1032
00:58:35,704 --> 00:58:37,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to pee so bad.

1033
00:58:37,145 --> 00:58:37,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1034
00:58:37,785 --> 00:58:38,846
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's excellent about this?

1035
00:58:39,646 --> 00:58:41,647
[SPEAKER_06]: IGN has a thing about Super Smash Bros.

1036
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl in there.

1037
00:58:43,028 --> 00:58:57,154
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says actually that the decision to include Solid Snake is basically from when Kojima actually begged to have the Metal Gear character in the last Smash Bros.

1038
00:58:57,174 --> 00:58:57,495
[SPEAKER_06]: game.

1039
00:58:57,735 --> 00:59:02,097
[SPEAKER_06]: They said when asked about the possibility of Sonic the Hedgehog appearing in the game as well...

1040
00:59:02,657 --> 00:59:11,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I was always hoping that they'd have a fighting game including all the characters from different games

1041
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:34,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the closest we had gotten before the Smash Brothers, well, there was Sonic the Fighters, which actually, you know, I didn't see that Sonic collection that they had last year, where they were supposed to have all the old Saturn Sonic games.

1042
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:40,694
[SPEAKER_06]: And all I've got to say is, if they make a new Kid Icarus game, that's going to look sweet.

1043
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:42,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

1044
00:59:42,656 --> 00:59:44,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that looks great, Kid Icarus.

1045
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:45,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1046
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:46,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I...

1047
00:59:50,842 --> 00:59:52,042
[SPEAKER_07]: We transition.

1048
00:59:52,082 --> 00:59:54,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we about ready to wrap up?

1049
00:59:54,463 --> 00:59:55,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Your producer left.

1050
00:59:55,643 --> 00:59:56,064
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all right.

1051
00:59:56,544 --> 00:59:57,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go run and find him.

1052
00:59:57,404 --> 00:59:58,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you very much.

1053
00:59:58,844 --> 01:00:02,525
[SPEAKER_01]: We can just stay here for a little bit longer and be the fabulous internet celebrities we are.

1054
01:00:02,545 --> 01:00:05,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get to talk about the Nintendo party.

1055
01:00:05,506 --> 01:00:08,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got a call on the bat phone, so I got to make this quick.

1056
01:00:08,747 --> 01:00:11,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's hear about the Nintendo party real quick, Logeeks.

1057
01:00:11,348 --> 01:00:15,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so anyways, I went to the Nintendo Party, they had Black Eyed Peas playing, it was kind of interesting.

1058
01:00:16,153 --> 01:00:19,616
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing though is I missed the preview, so I didn't get to play games beforehand.

1059
01:00:20,177 --> 01:00:28,665
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's even more interesting, on the way there, I saw a runaway bus smash through two cars and into a telephone pole, and then into a Rite Aid.

1060
01:00:29,345 --> 01:00:30,707
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was pretty awesome.

1061
01:00:31,087 --> 01:00:33,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, or, I don't know, brutal.

1062
01:00:35,823 --> 01:00:41,705
[SPEAKER_06]: The party wasn't really my thing, because a lot of people I didn't know there, but all the big names, I guess, were there, even from Nintendo.

1063
01:00:41,745 --> 01:00:45,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, no one had a name badge or anything, so we didn't know who the hell was who.

1064
01:00:45,846 --> 01:00:46,206
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1065
01:00:46,946 --> 01:00:53,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, live at the E3 Outpost.

1066
01:00:53,088 --> 01:00:55,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought, DarkSakura.

1067
01:00:56,108 --> 01:01:01,710
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to point out the funny deal that Captain N wasn't really a Nintendo character, and the show sucked.

1068
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:03,851
[SPEAKER_01]: So reject false icons.

1069
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:05,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Final thought, Loki.

1070
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:15,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned on E3PSB.com or E3OnPSB.com and definitely going to have a lot more stuff on there.

1071
01:01:15,279 --> 01:01:17,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kind of backlogged and getting everything on there.

1072
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots more videos and a lot more everything.

1073
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:21,943
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep watching.

1074
01:01:22,284 --> 01:01:25,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thought, Mr. Bobby Blackwolf and plug your site already.

1075
01:01:25,646 --> 01:01:31,430
[SPEAKER_08]: BobbyBlackwolfShow.com We're going to have our E3 show is Friday night, 8 p.m.,

1076
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:38,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Eastern, 5pm Pacific, right before OLR, but I hope all three of you at least show up for a couple minutes at least.

1077
01:01:38,935 --> 01:01:42,458
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, you guys should check out the Tuesday night episode of All Games Interactive.

1078
01:01:42,818 --> 01:01:45,500
[SPEAKER_08]: It has both Sky and DarkSakura on it as well.

1079
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

1080
01:01:46,241 --> 01:01:49,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Debating with Scott Rubin was a good time.

1081
01:01:49,363 --> 01:01:52,425
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys can do it again tonight after you pee.

1082
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:54,247
[SPEAKER_07]: I have got to wee in the worst way.

1083
01:01:54,287 --> 01:01:55,568
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my final thought.

1084
01:01:55,588 --> 01:01:55,868
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 minutes.

1085
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:58,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for a Nutri-Grain bar that Rob gave me.

1086
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:01,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't eaten since 10, so... I need to drink.

1087
01:02:01,152 --> 01:02:03,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to wrap it up here.

1088
01:02:03,715 --> 01:02:05,457
[SPEAKER_07]: For those of you guys listening live, stay tuned.
