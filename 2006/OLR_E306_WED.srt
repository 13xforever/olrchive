1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today is Wednesday, May 10th, 2006, and we're live at E3!

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Good evening, everybody. We are live at the E3 Outpost in West Los Angeles.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So, the sound sounds a little bit different tonight. That's because we're recording live here at the Arena Interactive Lounge.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Skye. Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hi.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How you doing?

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Tired.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah?

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm excited and tired at the same time. It's a very bizarre feeling.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Say hello, as well, to Tech Master, Loki.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How you doing, Loki?

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm doing good.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
All right. Also joining us tonight, we have some special guests, or a special guest, I should say. Say hello to Bobby.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hey, guys.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hey, Bobby.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is a thrill for me.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's about time we got you on our show. It just took E3 to finally get you here.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, exactly.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's all right. All right. Also, we want to say a shout-out to Mr. Lawrence Young, who's manning the controls tonight.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We appreciate his help in making the show work.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All right. Let's get right into it. Let's not waste time. Let's talk about E3.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I thought what we could do, let's go down the line, talk about three interesting things we saw at E3 today.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Jamie, give us one.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I would have to say Zelda Twilight Princess. Getting to play that was pretty fun.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Now, did you play the Zelda Twilight Princess on the Wii, or the...

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Wii.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The Wii.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I played on the Wii, and I went Wii.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Did Nintendo have a huge-ass line for the Wii today?

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Not if you made it in there in the early... We got in there at the tail end of the early media hours.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Right.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So we just sort of... Once we got in line, it was pretty cool.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I did get to hear... I never remember his name. I know his name is Charles, the guy who's Mario's voice.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, right, yeah.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sing the Mario... The old Mario theme song from the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's awesome.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The guys in front of us got him to... The guys from the Mushroom Kingdom got him to sing it.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I have it on tape.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sweet. That's awesome.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It was pretty fun.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So tell us about, how is Zelda on the Wii different from what we saw last year with the GameCube?

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, first of all, I didn't get to see it on the GameCube, so I don't know.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I do know that it is widescreen, whereas the GameCube version is not.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hurray, I'm so glad to hear there's widescreen support, because I was really worried about that with Wii.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, you're going to get 480p.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Good.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But probably nothing more than that.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
All right.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, you know, it's something. At least my widescreen TV isn't going to go to total waste.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So that makes me happy.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
All right, so that's one for Jamie. Loki, what would you say is one interesting thing you saw today?

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My favorite... You know, it was really a toss-up on Sega's booth, because there's a few things I liked.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I did get to play my first PS3 game, which would be Full Auto 2.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And, of course, me being such a big Full Auto whore.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
They had Full Auto 2 there? I totally missed it.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah, they had Full Auto 2 there.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They were debuting basically all the deathmatch modes, which I said should have been in the first one, but no.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So, anyways, they had that, and we were basically playing a six-player deathmatch and stuff, and if you won, you get a hat.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But, of course, I don't wear a hat, so I didn't care.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But, overall, the controls are basically the same.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Horrible framerate problems, just like the first one.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I mean, we're talking dropping down a crawl.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But, then again, it's not finished either, so...

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Do you think it's just an early build issue?

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, you know, I'm not sure, because the fact the first one had really bad framerate problems, too.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So, you never know.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But, I'm sure it's not done.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I just want to remind folks, if you guys are hearing ambient noise in the background, that is because we're not at your usual studio.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We are at the Arena Interactive Lounge, where the E3 Outpost is taking place.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If you're in the LA area, this thing's going on all week.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Come on down. We're off Santa Monica Boulevard.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We'll be here Thursday and Friday, taping live as well.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Other folks are taping, too. Scott Rubin and Lawrence Young doing their show.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Gamer Andy's got his gig going on. Bobby Blackwolf, Friday night, of course.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So, it's just... You know what this place is?

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I mean, there's like big, widescreen TVs everywhere.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's like a big gamer frat house.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Seriously, what it's like. It's awesome.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's cool. So, again, if we sound a little different out of our elements, it's because we are.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But, that's a good thing.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Anyway, I just wanted to give that a plug, because we are kind of using their equipment tonight.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So, we have to give them a big thank you.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We're also in their chat room because of it.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We're trying to keep an eye on it. It's a little harder, because we're not in our usual setup.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
chat.allgames.com

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And there's this wristband on my arm that says over 21, which means they have alcohol here.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That means you get to drink.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I got asked if I was over 21.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You always get carded.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, we didn't get those. We'll get those later.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, yeah. You're interesting.

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Very interesting thing. I'm going to give a shout out to the Music Game fans, because I know we have a lot of Music Game fans that listen to the program and are dying to know.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So, let me talk about the Bamani setup at Konami's booth, which is very interesting.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
They sort of have a round setup.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
2DX distorted machine is there.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Guitar Freaks V2 is there.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why? I have no idea.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Konami did not announce that Distorted is coming out for the home here.

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
They did not announce they're porting Guitar Freaks here in the US.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So they were just there to get butts in the booth, I guess.

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I did get a chance to play each of the three new DDR home versions.

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I did play around on Universe.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Universe looks a lot better than it does in the trailer, I'll tell you that.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Universe has a very disco funky feel to it.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The interface is a little crazy. The song select was kind of...

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's like a 3D wheel.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I liked it.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah, I kind of liked it. I dug it.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And there are repeats from old mixes.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I noticed Jairus was in the demo, and there's other stuff too.

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sure DDR Freak of Bamani style have lists posted already on those games.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I actually really liked UltraMix 4.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I kind of thought UltraMix 4 had the better song list.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The interface is just kind of like an upside down UltraMix 2.

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And there's really... I mean, it's another UltraMix.

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But I thought it had a better song list.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It has Listen to Your Heart, it had BitMania.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I had a lot of fun playing that.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I tried playing doubles on Universe,

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and unfortunately they had the pad set backwards.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So that didn't work.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Supernova is exactly what you'd expect.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And of course they have two Supernova machines, the home version.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But, Jamie, did you play DDR Supernova home version?

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No.

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
David Bowie's in it.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let's dance.

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh yeah, I knew that.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's awesome.

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And then of course, not just David Bowie, Kelly Clarkson,

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
if you're into American Idol since you've been gone.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Now that's kind of weird to me because I don't think that's in the arcade.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So it looks like there is going to be a little bit of diversity

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
between the home mix and the arcade mix.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've got to admit, I'm getting to the point, guys,

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
where DDR, especially these demos,

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
my thrill on DDR is the extra modes and the extra things that are in it,

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and they're not in these builds right now.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I was just glad they had freaking arcade cabinets there

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
because I hate playing on those goddamn soft pads.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Did you notice that they have the soft pads?

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's like literally saran wrap to the floor.

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
At least it's not duct tape.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What did you think of the Universe 360 pads?

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They're just like soft pads.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I get lost on them again because, you know, I don't know.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm actually going to go play Karaoke Revolution Country Edition tomorrow.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
All right, I'm going to our chat room.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Remember we're temporarily tonight in chat.allgames.com.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We'll be there all week long because we love allgames.com.

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's see.

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Weiland wants to know, wait, Bowie isn't what?

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
David Bowie's Let's Dance is going to be a danceable song in DDR Super Nova.

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Guys, guys.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay, and then also going to the chat room there, let's see.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Sephiroth1215, one of our fans, says, I hate Kelly.

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Well, you know, a lot of people do, but a lot of people like her, you know.

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Speaking of Kelly, it seems that they've dropped the Karaoke Revolution title from American Idol,

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
if you notice that, on the trailer.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, no, I didn't notice.

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, first off, the game's not even to a point where they can show it at E3,

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
which is why we have Country here.

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But they dropped the title.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
All they really had for the video was just, you know, the intro that you see normally on American Idol.

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It just says, coming in the winter.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Weird.

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
All right.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Bobby, do you have an interesting thing you want to share with us?

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Well, unfortunately, I didn't get to play all that much today just because, you know, getting in late

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and, you know, just walking around and making sure I saw everything.

172
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Other than, you know, the utterly disappointing Square Theater,

173
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
which is usually a wonderful production with, like, great production values, lights everywhere,

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
you know, everything's, like, synchronized.

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This time it was just a digital projection.

176
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I did get to play Guitar Man Lives for the PSP.

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And you're sitting there, you're smiling and nodding.

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I wouldn't.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It is a straight port of the PlayStation 2, same music, same note patterns and everything.

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The only thing that has changed is now if you pause it, you can continue.

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You don't have to start over.

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Actually, you also have a duet mode.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Do that? Because they didn't show that.

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You play as Kira, who was the, I guess, the girl in the game.

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You can do duet mode with her, and there's a versus mode.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay.

187
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
There was a versus mode in the PS2 version, though.

188
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It was showing it off like it was some sort of new thing, but the duet mode I know is new.

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay.

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Interesting.

191
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But it's still all the same songs?

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That is a bit of a letdown.

193
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I was hoping for some new Guitar Man, but I guess some people will be excited to see that it's on the go.

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah.

195
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay, whatever.

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I wanted to go back to this Square Enix trailer.

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You know, I feel horrible saying this because I thought Square had some of the nicest staff that I dealt with all day.

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
They had really great staff, and they were nice.

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But the trailer presentation was a letdown because a lot of what they were showing was stuff that's already out.

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Although, it is something else to see it on the digital projection and all its high-def glory.

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That was kind of neat.

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Final Fantasy XIII looks sexy as hell.

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Only three seconds of gameplay to see, though, but it did look sexy.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There was some in-game footage, but it was like the cinematic footage using the game engine.

206
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I could tell because there were still jaggies, and it's the PlayStation 3.

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah.

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Didn't they learn?

209
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We'll see, we'll see.

210
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I mean, again, these trailers, it's the same reason why I'm not screaming and hollering about Halo 3 yet.

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's a trailer that didn't show us much of the actual game itself, you know what I mean?

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let's wait until I can actually get my hand on the controller, play it, try it out.

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You know what, the square thing will give the fans what they want, so whatever.

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They'll have a good time with that.

215
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Jamie, number two, a second interesting thing you saw today.

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Guitar Hero 2.

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ah, how was that?

218
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It was fun.

219
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Basically, it brought in the two that actually, it really added in something else that I wouldn't have mind seeing.

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I wanted bass mode in the first one, and this gives me bass mode.

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Instead of having versus play, you have cooperative play, which is how I think it should be anyway if, you know, you've got a band on stage.

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You know, if one person sucks, the whole band's got to pretty much blow it.

223
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But the way it works now is that Player 1 is lead guitar, Player 2, depending on song, is either bass or rhythm.

224
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And they're even bringing in the very newest models for their available guitars, the newest Gibson guitars available.

225
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm still going to have the Flying V, they brought in the Thunderbirds, Thunderbird now.

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We still have the, you know, Les Paul, the SGs.

227
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And there's still hidden characters in it, new unlockable content.

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I played YYZ, that was like cool.

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That was really awesome.

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So, I mean, are there enough differences from the first game to make this, you know, worthwhile?

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I didn't see enough to really make a judgment like that yet.

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But, you know, just having new songs to play is great.

233
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You know, if it were me, I would have been, I mean, I know it is on PlayStation 2,

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
but I would think that they'd want to jump to Xbox and have downloadable content.

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That would be a smart way to go.

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But as it is now, I think it's going to be pretty good.

237
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And they actually had those nice lovely red controllers that were really nice.

238
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
All right, let's go to the chat room and see some comments there.

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Chantaz over in chat.allgames.com says, Halo 3 teaser ripped off System Shock.

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So, not a person who wasn't a big fan of the Halo 3,

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
or maybe he was a fan of the Halo 3 teaser, but just felt it ripped off another one.

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Funnydale says, it's sad, Square is turning Final Fantasy into the new Madden.

243
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I kind of agree with that.

244
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
They need to get off Final Fantasy VII.

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
They are killing it.

246
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Final Fantasy VII football, I bet, will be next year's announcement.

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What do you think?

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It looks like some folks in the chat room are getting buffered tonight.

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Guys, I'm sure we're getting bombarded with people tonight, which is amazing.

250
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Thank you guys for supporting the show.

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't forget it will be on our podcast stream a little later.

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Let's see.

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Somebody had said something about Guitar Man.

254
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I want to say it was Xander here.

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Xander C says, I restarted at least three times accidentally on the original Guitar Man because I couldn't pause.

256
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So, that new feature will come in handy.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Xander also says, Final Fantasy Versus XIII is being made by the Kingdom Hearts II team.

258
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's correct.

259
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That is correct.

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's a joint production.

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy.

262
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But here's the thing, dude.

263
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's all we know about Final Fantasy Versus XIII.

264
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The trailer didn't tell a shit.

265
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It tells you that there's a main male character who has psychic Miss Cleo gone way wrong abilities and that's about it.

266
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Alright, anyway.

267
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Girl with gun blades.

268
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
In the original Final Fantasy XIII, yes.

269
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah.

270
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And then there's a Final Fantasy XIII mobile, but I'm not even going to go there because I'll cry.

271
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Blah, blah, blah.

272
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Final Fantasy.

273
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Loki.

274
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Something interesting.

275
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Well, let's see here.

276
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I did, of course, also play the Wii.

277
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I got to play Red Steel.

278
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And that was okay, actually.

279
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't know.

280
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm still kind of...

281
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's the first time I've played it.

282
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And I thought that the controls were way too sensitive.

283
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Like, it was very awkward playing it and it did not feel natural.

284
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And if I were a very judgmental mom buying this for my kids, I would probably be turned away by it if it's going to stay like this.

285
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Because it wasn't easy, but there were other games that were also being shown, like WarioWare, which was really awesome.

286
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I mean, just what they're doing with the controller is amazing.

287
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What you would expect from a WarioWare game.

288
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Overall, the Wii stuff, I did play Red Steel.

289
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I played a WarioWare and this kind of like obstacle course tech demo thing.

290
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And each one very sensitive as far as the control scheme.

291
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Now, Loki and Dark Sakura, I didn't spend a lot of time in Nintendo's booth today.

292
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It was so crowded.

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I hate their layout this year.

294
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I think the layout is ass.

295
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's like a claustrophobic nightmare.

296
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm sorry Nintendo, but having that huge dome in the middle with the...

297
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That you can't get into.

298
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Horrible idea.

299
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But tell us about, because a lot of folks listening aren't going to E3, how is Nintendo's booth set up?

300
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
How did you guys get in there? What happens when you get in there?

301
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Well, you're around basically the surrounding wall when you're in line and you go in.

302
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And it's like a spiral.

303
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
They have these talking walls.

304
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They're like walls of pictures of people sitting in white rooms or whatever.

305
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But they actually have a camera and can talk to you and they have the voice of Mario there.

306
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah, that's how we got to hear him sing.

307
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But it was funny though, because I was like, well, why do they have people mocking me in line as I'm waiting?

308
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But I don't know, it was interesting, a little bit different.

309
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't know what the point was, but...

310
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There was one of those guys that was very knowledgeable and kept giving a lot of really good information.

311
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So it was sort of like having a rep there to talk with you while you're in line to sort of hype you up to go see it.

312
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But once you got in, you circled around and went on this raised platform with sort of half of it covered in a picture on one side and the other side.

313
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And then there were three in the middle, three widescreen TVs and different people were playing different games.

314
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
There's another one on the wall, but that was sort of for when they did the drum demo.

315
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah.

316
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But when we went through there, Koji Kondo was playing the orchestra game and I got his autograph.

317
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Sweet!

318
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That made me very, very happy.

319
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Was that orchestra three thing actually a game or just a demo?

320
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's a game.

321
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's demo.

322
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
No, I thought they said it was gonna...

323
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's a tech demo.

324
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Well, I guess we will see.

325
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Alright.

326
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Ah, shut up.

327
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
If I wanted your opinion, I'd turn your mic on.

328
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Because they had a series of demo games playable and they were bringing out different ones as though they were going to be released later on as packaged items.

329
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
At least as far as I was led to believe.

330
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Well, looking at what they were talking about yesterday during the press conference is that they have this Wii Sports thing.

331
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And it actually looks like a collection of a bunch of small games.

332
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Almost like, remember the first Nintendo system where they had it packaged with Mario and Duck Hunt.

333
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
They would have a bunch of like small tech demo things that kind of almost orient you to this new control scheme.

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So they have the baseball, golf, tennis and a pilot wings type of game which is very kind of different.

335
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Bobby, a second interesting thing you saw today.

336
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Blink, blink, blink, blink.

337
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The sensitive controls of Sonic the Hedgehog on the PS3.

338
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Wasn't that weird?

339
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It made me cry.

340
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I was not a fan of Sonic on PS3, I have to admit.

341
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Do you know how many times I fell off the edge?

342
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah, I watched.

343
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It had so much potential to be good.

344
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And I can see Jamie getting motion sickness from that just because of the way it was jumping around.

345
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I left it with a headache.

346
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I mean I felt nauseous and had a headache and on top of that my heart was broken.

347
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So thank you Sony.

348
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Well do you think the Xbox version will be just as bad?

349
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That's in the Sega booth, we'll have to check.

350
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah, we'll have to look tomorrow.

351
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm going to find out and if it isn't I'll blame Sega and I'll go cry there.

352
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I played the one in the Sega booth and the controls.

353
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The camera kind of was pissing me off and I couldn't figure out how to play.

354
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I was playing the Silver Sonic one.

355
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
They had two different levels once as Sonic wins.

356
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Silver Sonic being like super duper super science Sonic with psycho kinetic powers and crap.

357
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So I don't know.

358
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Now one of the things I do want to mention about the PS3 controller.

359
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Because we got to actually see it and play it that a lot of people don't realize.

360
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Because you've never really seen a good look of it.

361
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And yes the PlayStation circle button in the middle is touchable.

362
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It didn't do anything in what we had.

363
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
But the L2 and the R2 buttons are now like the triggers on the Xbox.

364
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
They're not straight buttons.

365
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
They are actually analog triggers.

366
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I thought that was kind of interesting.

367
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I missed my number two.

368
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
My number two thing I thought was interesting today would be Luminous Live.

369
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's way back in the corner of the very crowded Microsoft booth.

370
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But oh my God it's just Luminous on the TV.

371
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's all I wanted.

372
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's great.

373
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I mean if this is only going to be five bucks I'm betting it will probably be 800 points not 400.

374
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But even then Luminous is such a great game.

375
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That was such a surprise to me.

376
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I could not believe that that came over on Xbox.

377
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That's going to be great.

378
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm so excited about it.

379
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But yeah for those of you guys that are wondering about Luminous Live.

380
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's pretty much just Luminous on the Xbox.

381
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Pretty hot.

382
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I liked it.

383
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Music videos in the background.

384
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Dave you other guys go to Microsoft's booth today?

385
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's not like you guys spend most of your day in West Hall whereas Bobby and I are mostly in South Hall today.

386
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I saw Viva Pinata the demo the presentation of Viva Pinata in there.

387
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And it's like let's see Animal Crossing meets Harvest Moon meets Spore meets some other stuff probably.

388
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's kind of the way it looked.

389
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I still don't know really what it is.

390
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Remind me to look for Spore tomorrow.

391
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's all in EA's stuff.

392
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We've totally missed EA today.

393
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We'll definitely have more tomorrow.

394
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Did they say they were going to have a new what was it Midnight Club game?

395
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Or not Midnight Club Need for Speed game.

396
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I was looking for that today but I didn't see it at all.

397
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Was it Need for Speed Carbon I think?

398
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't know.

399
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Alright one more interesting thing you saw today.

400
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Dark Sakura.

401
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I know you're typing in chat right now.

402
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh you're arguing with somebody about graphics versus gameplay?

403
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That pisses me off so much.

404
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Alright.

405
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What I just said is I don't want a pretty game that plays like crap.

406
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Alright.

407
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Okay.

408
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Assistant is only as good as the games that are on it?

409
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes?

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Exactly.

411
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I said that to a Sony rep today and he just sort of blinked at me.

412
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It was funny.

413
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Why does that not surprise me?

414
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
No he blinked and he thought about it because you know you're right.

415
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Alright.

416
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,640
Anyway my number one and actually my list has been about equal but I have to say Sonic

417
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,000
Rivals on PSP.

418
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah?

419
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I loved it.

420
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Oh my god.

421
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It was like everything that I loved about Sonic with racing shadow.

422
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And it was like playing a 2D Sonic but 3D.

423
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It was just fast and great and I just had the most fun and then they gave me a t-shirt

424
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
that I can't wear.

425
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's like three sizes too big.

426
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Well that's cool though.

427
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Does Sega have a theater this year?

428
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I didn't see I don't think so.

429
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm going to explore Sega in more detail tomorrow.

430
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But I was just like it's a really good Sonic game on PSP.

431
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I mean there's only one level I got to play but if the whole thing is like that I'm all

432
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
over that.

433
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah.

434
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I mean it's just all the fast fun stuff I liked about Sonic and I didn't get to see

435
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
too much more than just what they had on demo but I'm hoping that there's a multiplayer

436
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
player race because you have first place, second place I would assume you can do more

437
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
characters.

438
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I mean these sort of Sonic are just on a side scrolling level.

439
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I think it's pretty cool.

440
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Loki.

441
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I played what was it?

442
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh.

443
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm trying such a play.

444
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Dead Rising.

445
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That game is Mr. Young.

446
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Really fun.

447
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You just you basically put them all you know put in the Dawn of Dead scenario with you

448
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
can do anything.

449
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I was picking up pots smashing the people.

450
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I you know ate a pie.

451
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I was playing around with the Servbot mass and stuck one on you know zombie and smashed

452
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
it with a sledgehammer.

453
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I mean that game is going to be endless hours of fun for me.

454
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's so gory but really fun.

455
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm definitely getting it when it comes out.

456
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Awesome.

457
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Bobby you got one more?

458
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Well I mean it's not as interesting as like what everybody else played because like I

459
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
said I didn't get to play the Wii which is what I would be talking about but we actually

460
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
looked at the new Dot Hack game.

461
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I was actually thinking about that.

462
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah the Dot Hack it's what GU or something like that.

463
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I don't remember what it was.

464
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's like Rebirth or something.

465
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Right and but it looks like it's going to be another episodic you know and they don't

466
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
know the guy that I talked to didn't know what price it was going to be or anything

467
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
but it looked like more of the same.

468
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Now it did have a lot more like animations and stuff and I actually got like the typical

469
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
anime where it shows the three main characters in like a split screen view for half a second

470
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
then they all go crazy and everything goes red but the demo I wish it was longer because

471
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I really didn't get it.

472
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah that was my biggest problem with the Dot Hack demo is it wasn't long enough and

473
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
you pretty much fought the same monster although I thought getting on the bike was cool.

474
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah you can ride around on a bike.

475
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Dot Hack is kind of a fan service thing anyway you know.

476
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
How are you going to be disappointed in Dot Hack this Dot Hack game if you're a Dot Hack

477
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
anime fan.

478
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But you know if you like the first it feels like just like the first games with a little

479
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
more like the super combos and stuff that I missed in the first series of games.

480
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Gosh what should I do for my last interesting thing.

481
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm going to say Phantasy Star Universe.

482
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Phantasy Star Universe I got to play it on PC which looked superior to the PS2 one I

483
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
saw.

484
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's it's it's great because they didn't change a lot of the Phantasy Star online formula.

485
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
They just made it a little better that you can do a little more super attacks like it

486
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
looked like he had some more like tactical points kind of thing that you can only do

487
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
so many power hits in a row.

488
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So you can't just keep pouring those power hits but you can actually like get in a fourth

489
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
hit.

490
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I think Phantasy Star Universe is going to be if you guys are on Phantasy Star online

491
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
it's going to be great for you guys.

492
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Unfortunately the only disappointment I have with that is that there weren't they weren't

493
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
showing the 360 version.

494
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So that kind of made me a little sad.

495
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
All right.

496
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So I guess we all got our interesting things out.

497
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I got a wacky question.

498
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Can we can we take calls.

499
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yes you can.

500
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
We do calls.

501
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Yes.

502
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Give out the number Bobby.

503
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
OK.

504
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Well you can either do we have both Skype and the toll free number.

505
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
OK.

506
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Give out the toll free number because you don't want to have to have all those people

507
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
on Skype.

508
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
OK.

509
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So the toll free number is 1 8 6 6 8 8 0 0 1 5 6.

510
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That's a toll free number here in the United States.

511
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Go ahead put that in chat.

512
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Lawrence one call at a time though because when we get like two people on the line I

513
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
get crazy.

514
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So.

515
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
All right.

516
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Real quick though before we while we're waiting for some calls.

517
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Booth babes.

518
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Big controversy.

519
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And there really weren't a whole lot on the show for this year.

520
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I saw some in the Final Fantasy and I remember I turned to you and I'm like five thousand

521
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
dollars.

522
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Well they were Mithra girls though.

523
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
There were more cosplayers than booth babes.

524
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah.

525
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
What do you think.

526
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Is the show different without booth babes.

527
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I didn't notice they weren't there.

528
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I didn't notice nor did I miss nor did I care.

529
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I did.

530
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You know I didn't really notice either and I hope I don't come off sounding like the

531
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
token gay guy in the show saying that but I just.

532
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I really didn't change the show because the show is about the games not about that scenery

533
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and people were going in to see the games anyway.

534
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
What was that.

535
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Somebody had come up with a creative substitute for the booth babes anyway.

536
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
What are you guys talking about in the bus.

537
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We were talking about the Transformers.

538
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I don't know if that was more.

539
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Yeah.

540
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah.

541
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
There was there was there's an Optimus Prime in one of the booths and there's no Transformers

542
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
game in there but it got him in the booth.

543
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
There was a banner for the Transformers movie.

544
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Oh is that what it was.

545
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah.

546
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Savages.

547
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Savages.

548
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
A bunch of savages.

549
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Where's my game.

550
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
All right.

551
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
They did a Transformers game and it wasn't very good.

552
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
They've done several.

553
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
PlayStation 3.

554
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Did.

555
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Did your.

556
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It sounds like we all got to play PlayStation 3 today.

557
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah.

558
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Did your impressions of the PlayStation 3 go up from the Sony conference.

559
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Were you disappointed.

560
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What did you think.

561
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I also played Gran Turismo HD and it was like another Gran Turismo and it was pretty but

562
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,000
honestly I I also saw that Heavenly Blade my my opinion is still remains the same Sony

563
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
shot themselves actually Heavenly Sword Heavenly Sword.

564
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
All right.

565
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
All right.

566
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm thinking Dancing Blade which is another PlayStation game.

567
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I still think that they've shot themselves in the foot.

568
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And this time with having not the best of games to show for it.

569
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We have a caller on the line.

570
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
OK.

571
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I thought then I'll say hello to the car.

572
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It was crap then.

573
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Crap now.

574
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
All right.

575
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Hi.

576
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
You're on Orange Lounge Radio live at the E3 Outpost.

577
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Who's this.

578
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's the Ichiban Crush.

579
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
The Ichiban Crush one of my very favorite posters on the forums.

580
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
What's on your mind buddy.

581
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah.

582
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So I'm looking at the E3 news on Monday and see the price announcement for PS3.

583
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I can't help to wonder myself man but I mean I know this is Blu-ray and you're not going

584
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
to hear you just cannot get any cheaper than that but this thing really going to sell you.

585
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Here's my thing with PlayStation 3 Sony has really yet to explain why their console is

586
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
worth 200 more bucks than Xbox 360.

587
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And in playing the demos today I mean for instance Sonic Sonic is a game that's on Xbox

588
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
360.

589
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Why do I need to invest the extra money in the PlayStation 3.

590
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
However to PlayStation 3's credits they do have a grip on some of the real great franchises

591
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
that Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer is you know fanboy boner inducing Final Fantasy 13.

592
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I mean you know I'm a big Final Fantasy fan so of course.

593
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Oh yeah.

594
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh God.

595
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And you know they've got games that I think are going to cater to the fanboys you know

596
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
but they're still for the average gamer Microsoft's in a great position right now because their

597
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
system is cheaper and it's at a glance right now seems to do the same thing as PlayStation

598
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
3.

599
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
What was missing from that conference for me was that Sony didn't tell me why I needed

600
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Blu-ray.

601
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Does anybody else have thoughts on that.

602
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Well I don't know I've actually played Final Fantasy 12 and if that's any indication what

603
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Final Fantasy 13 is going to be then I'm better off without it.

604
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I like I love Final Fantasy 12 a whole lot.

605
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Final Fantasy 12 had the single worst combat system ever.

606
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It took the stuff that was good about grandia and made it crap.

607
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
We agree to disagree there I suppose.

608
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Like what was with that whole line business.

609
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Zander C and Chad don't like Microsoft.

610
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Zander C says Microsoft has yet to show why their console is worth more than 150 dollars.

611
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I the stuff they're doing with arcade and Gears of War this is incredible.

612
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm I guys I know how you feel.

613
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
If you had told me four years ago I would be here saying positive things about Microsoft.

614
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I would have said you're full of shit.

615
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You know we lost planet right now.

616
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
This is lost planet that looks really good.

617
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
This is one reason why this console is over you know worth the money that it is I mean

618
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
lost planet right here.

619
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:30,000
One Capcom really has you know a level mind when it comes to the games that they're putting out in the 360.

620
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
They are truly next gen.

621
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I mean Dead Rising and Lost Planet just two of the finest games on the 360.

622
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
They're coming out this year.

623
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
All right.

624
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's Yvonne crush anything else on your mind any other questions for us.

625
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'll be honest with you.

626
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm really really worried about this upcoming this whole upcoming next gen just mainly because of Sony.

627
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I don't think it's going to cause another crash like everyone's been saying for the past two decades.

628
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But I don't know I'm just not feeling it this time around.

629
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Not the way I was with the 16 bit 32 bit era.

630
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You know it's it's a different battle this time because the battle is not just about the games.

631
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But it's about getting that console in your living room so you can get the music and the on demand movies and all this other stuff.

632
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That's a factor that we've never had to really deal with before.

633
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
So I think that's kind of what makes a lot of this very interesting.

634
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So but yeah you're right.

635
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's this one is too hard to tell because look at Japan.

636
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You know Xbox has really yet to catch on there is.

637
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Is it going to catch wildfire after E3.

638
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I don't know it's hard for me to say.

639
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You know it could be very I think what would be most interesting about this is if Microsoft ends up on top here in the US.

640
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Again I'm purely speculating guys please don't take this as my opinion on what's going to happen or whatever.

641
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But what if Microsoft's on top here in the US and then Sony's on top in Japan.

642
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Wouldn't that be something.

643
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
That means that we're still going to get another crappy PlayStation later on.

644
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I hope I hope Sony's taking the feedback.

645
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You know it seems like they did it before when everybody bitched about the boomerang controller.

646
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
They went back and changed it.

647
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So hopefully Sony's listen this time.

648
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Who knows.

649
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The boomerang just looks uncomfortable.

650
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
All right.

651
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's about the controller like the boomerang.

652
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It's not good.

653
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's my crush.

654
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You know I love you but I got to let you go so we can get more.

655
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
All right.

656
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Absolutely.

657
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Thanks guys.

658
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Thanks for calling.

659
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm going.

660
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
All right.

661
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You too.

662
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
One of the things I did before he called was about you were talking about Gran Turismo.

663
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And a lot of people probably looked at the demo and they're like oh that's so cool the people move.

664
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Well I'm going to tell you right now they are still 2D paper people.

665
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I looked and you know the people because that's one of the things a lot of people have about the Gran Turismo series is that the people look like they're like 2D pieces of paper.

666
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And they still are in that early demo.

667
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Listen.

668
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I played the Tokyo track and it.

669
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm going to.

670
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
We're going to go to another call guys.

671
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
This is Nintendo Orange Launch Radio live at E3 Outpost.

672
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Who's this?

673
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Hello.

674
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
This is Nintendo Maniac 64 or Bad Starter Maniac 64.

675
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Hi Nintendo Maniac 64.

676
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
How are you doing?

677
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm static over the whole freeze thing because I'm all the way in the east coast.

678
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You're static about the freeze going on right now.

679
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah.

680
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
What's going on?

681
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Is the weather nuts or something?

682
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's been kind of hot.

683
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It's been kind of hot recently.

684
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Well tell us about E3.

685
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
What are your thoughts on E3 so far?

686
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Well one thing that caught my attention actually was Nintendo's press conference when they were doing the DS game.

687
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
They showed Diddy Kong Racing.

688
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
They had them show Snowball Valley from the original on there.

689
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It was interesting.

690
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You've got a good eye because honestly I was one of those people that didn't really care about Diddy Kong Racing because I was too distracted by the thoughts of Star Fox on the DS.

691
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Because they kind of showed that all at once and I was like ooh Star Fox.

692
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Ah fuck Diddy Kong I want Star Fox.

693
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Diddy Kong Racing sucked anyways.

694
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Well this is Nintendo Maniac so he might have a different opinion.

695
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Alright.

696
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You got any questions for us Nintendo Maniac?

697
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Um, let's see...

698
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh yeah.

699
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Oh you know what never mind on that question.

700
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Alright.

701
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Let's see is there anything else?

702
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Oh how long did you have to wait to get to play Twilight Princess?

703
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
To get to play what?

704
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
To get to play Twilight Princess.

705
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I can't.

706
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Twilight Princess.

707
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Oh Twilight Princess.

708
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I waited about 30 to 45 minutes.

709
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
There were people in front of us who were hogging it and passing it off to their friends and everything.

710
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And so we actually waited for a while and then we just ended up talking about all kinds of other things and then by the time we were up there.

711
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Keep in mind though she was in the early access media hours which was a benefit.

712
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Now I'm talking about once I was already in.

713
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Oh damn.

714
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Yeah see it takes about an hour to two and a half hours from what they told me to get into the Wii area.

715
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And then you got to wait behind people. It's just normal kiosk once you get in there.

716
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Alright Nintendo Maniac 64 thanks so much for the call. We're going to go ahead and let you go buddy okay?

717
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Okay.

718
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Alright have a good one.

719
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Bye.

720
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Alright we're going to take one more call. Let's see who we got.

721
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Lawrence Young the man on the controls. Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

722
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Hey this is SSJ100Mav.

723
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
SSJ100Mav what's on your mind buddy? Thanks for the call. What's going on?

724
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Hey I was wondering what you guys thought of the new test members on Super Smash Brothers.

725
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Super Smash Brothers. Loki you pulled up the story. Fill us in on what's going on with Super Smash Brothers.

726
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Well they announced today that there's going to be a title called Super Smash Brothers Brawl coming out for the Wii.

727
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Looks like it's going to be controlled kind of the same way as the original Super Smash Brothers.

728
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Probably not with the Wii controller but then again we don't know we're just speculating.

729
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:14,000
However some of the characters in it are quite interesting. For example you've got Snake from Metal Gear Solid.

730
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
That is crazy.

731
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Pit from Kid Icarus.

732
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Yay!

733
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Nintendo thank you for finally fucking acknowledging this game you've ignored for the past like 20 years.

734
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You have Wario is going to be another one and also Zero Suit Samus.

735
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Ooh that's pretty hot.

736
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Which was pretty interesting and then there was one more I want to say oh god I don't remember some metal robot thing.

737
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But one of the very interesting things that's on here they show one of the attacks and what's one of the attacks but an Nintendog licking the screen.

738
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Oh Jesus.

739
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
He's so bumpy.

740
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You guys.

741
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And Snake has his box.

742
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Alright.

743
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
That's great.

744
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
This is J100 Matt we got to wrap up and thanks so much for the call alright. Have a good one buddy.

745
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It is good.

746
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Alright.

747
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So that's going to be our last call for the night we're going to wrap up so that we can get out of here so all games interactive can take over for a little bit so.

748
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Oh stretch.

749
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
No I'm getting the stretch it out sign.

750
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Ok never mind then we won't.

751
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Comments from chat room.

752
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Boss Tone, Totion they all want to know.

753
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Dance Dance TV.

754
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
What the hell do we think of this?

755
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:35,000
If you guys didn't hear what is it Loki correct me if I'm wrong because I was reading about this late last night CBS television is option Dance Dance TV right.

756
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah.

757
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And Dance Dance TV is going to be a show that's going to be what the Saturday morning slumber party on CBS or something like that.

758
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I don't know and I'm kind of afraid to even consider wanting to know.

759
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:57,000
What I picked up on it is that it's like it's supposed to be teams of kids competing against each other and it's inspired by DDR or something like that.

760
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So you know what guys from Konami's perspective it's all about whatever is going to sell more games right.

761
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I don't see this as a bad thing.

762
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Am I going to watch it.

763
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Fuck no.

764
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But am I going to hate it just because it's out there.

765
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:38,000
No I understand we got to do crazy things to promote our stuff sometimes I don't I don't think it's a bad thing and I don't think it's going to make DDR look stupid because I honestly if somebody were to come up to me and tell me dude you're playing that DDR game that's on a little girls morning TV show I would say dude you were watching Saturday morning TV for little girls.

766
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I don't know. It looks stupid. I'm not watching it but I don't know.

767
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Zander C in chat room says they're a little late to be making a DVR TV show.

768
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
They should have tried that back in 2002.

769
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Remember DVR the movie.

770
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Oh that was such a fan thing.

771
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I know.

772
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
All right.

773
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm going to kind of try to wind it down here a little bit.

774
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I want to go around and talk about what are you guys looking forward to tomorrow.

775
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It's a three day show.

776
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
What do you want to do tomorrow.

777
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Dark Sakura.

778
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Tomorrow I'm actually planning on hanging out with SEGA and Namco Bandai a bit more.

779
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
But SEGA really because they have a game I want to actually see if it plays just right.

780
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
They had I went by and someone was playing Mighty Final Fight on a PSP.

781
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And you know I love Final Fight.

782
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I think that's like Capcom collection.

783
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah.

784
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I played Power Stone collection.

785
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It's just not that I missed the Dreamcast.

786
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It's not the same on the small screen I'm sorry.

787
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Well this I was a little surprised that the games that are on it they have the NES versions

788
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
of the games like they have the Nintendo version of Strider which was I don't like it because

789
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
it's that whole story thing based off of the old Strider manga that was out a few years

790
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
ago.

791
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I would much rather have them do like you know a Mega Drive collection where we have

792
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Strider you know like the actual arcade Strider and you know actual arcade Final Fight in

793
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
this you know because the PSP could easily do it but these are Nintendo.

794
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
This is going to be random but I forgot to tell you Strider's on Game Cab now.

795
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I knew that.

796
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Pretty hot huh.

797
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You told me yesterday.

798
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Now Jamie did you see that they had that Capcom classic collection mini that's going to be

799
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
on the Game Boy Advance which has Strider and Bionic Commando.

800
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Well that's the other game that was on the PSP thing was Bionic Commando.

801
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Excellent.

802
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Honestly I love Mighty Final Fight but I have that on Nintendo.

803
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I have all those on Nintendo.

804
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I can just play them on Nintendo.

805
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
So that just seems like sort of a waste of the PSP right there even though I love all

806
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
those games.

807
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So I do plan on giving it a play, see how it plays, see if it's anything like it, if

808
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
it'd be worth it to me if it adds anything or anything worthwhile but I'm definitely

809
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
going to be hanging out around Capcom and Sega and Namco Bandai tomorrow.

810
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Alright.

811
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Going to chat room for some comments here.

812
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Rockus, O-L-R Rockus wants to know in chat.allgames.com.

813
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Song list updates for the DDR's anyone?

814
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Honestly I'm going to be honest with you.

815
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Check DDRfreak.com or BomaniStyle.com.

816
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm sure they have it up.

817
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I know I played Precious, some remix of Precious by Depeche Mode in the universe one and I

818
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:29,000
played Listen to Your Heart in UltraMix 4 and I played Since You've Been Gone on Supernova.

819
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I did get to play Seduction in the vocal mix now which is in Supernova in the arcade.

820
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Sweet.

821
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Actually I did want to issue a challenge.

822
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Okay.

823
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
If any of our listeners are at E3 I would love to meet people up at SNK to own them

824
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
on King of Fighters 2006.

825
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Awesome.

826
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Quick programming note just for people here on the live stream, sorry to your podcast

827
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
folks over here.

828
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
That's alright.

829
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
All Games Interactive will be going on after Gamer Andy.

830
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
We're not, so we're going, O-L-R is going to go until about 8.15.

831
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Oh are we really?

832
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Okay.

833
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So I'm letting them know at the same time instead of trying to whisper in their ear.

834
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Okay.

835
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So yeah, but Gamer Andy live from the Microsoft press conference at 8.15 and then All Games

836
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Interactive at 9.30 when they get kicked out of the Microsoft press conference.

837
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Alright.

838
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So you're, don't worry about ending right now.

839
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Alright.

840
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You've got a little while longer.

841
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
But if you want to take more calls, that's cool.

842
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Alright, maybe we'll do more calls in a little bit.

843
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
For right now though, let's finish up this thought we were going down.

844
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Something you want to look at tomorrow.

845
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Loki, what are you going to be doing tomorrow?

846
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I will probably be hitting up the Sony booth because I was mainly in, was it South Hall

847
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
today.

848
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So I need to hit up West Hall.

849
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
There's still parts of South Hall that I haven't seen so I might need to go back there.

850
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I actually hit up a lot of the Korean booths today.

851
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I think just because I was that bored.

852
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And then, I don't know.

853
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Probably, yeah, just hitting up some of the games I haven't played for Sony.

854
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Just trying all the new ones.

855
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Maybe trying Nintendo again to see if I can try playing, you know, Metroid Prime 3 or

856
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
something like that.

857
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Other than that, I don't know.

858
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Oh, I got to check out the PSP stuff definitely.

859
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Yeah.

860
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I didn't do that either.

861
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Let's go to the, we got the call sign.

862
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So let's go to the phones.

863
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

864
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Who's this?

865
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
This is SilentWind96.

866
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Hello, SilentWind96.

867
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
What's on your mind?

868
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Oh, just chilling here.

869
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm down the street in my hotel and I was...

870
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Come on down.

871
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Yeah.

872
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I didn't, I couldn't get a pass.

873
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
So I couldn't, I couldn't get a temporary job at EB Games or nothing so I could get

874
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
into this joint.

875
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
But...

876
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Wait, wait.

877
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
You couldn't get into E3 at all?

878
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
No, I don't have any credentials to get in.

879
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So I couldn't get into E3 at all.

880
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:45,000
No, I don't have any credentials to get in so I couldn't really...

881
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
No, come to the outpost.

882
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
You know what?

883
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
At the outpost, you don't need a credential.

884
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
You can get in here.

885
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Oh, really?

886
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Yeah.

887
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I'll tell you what.

888
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
You know what?

889
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I'll get you in.

890
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
We will get you in this place for free.

891
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Right?

892
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Can we do that?

893
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yeah.

894
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
You know what?

895
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I can't...

896
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Does he have a...

897
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Can you send somebody...

898
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,320
How do we get him in touch with us?

899
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,920
Actually, you're in chat so you just PM me your name.

900
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
Okay.

901
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,320
I want you to send a private message to Black Wolf and he'll get you in touch.

902
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,320
Okay.

903
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Get on down here.

904
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,320
You can get in this place at least.

905
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,320
Oh, yeah.

906
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,320
Thank you.

907
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,320
All right.

908
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
Any questions you want to know about E3?

909
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,320
I'm so sorry to hear you didn't get in.

910
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,320
Any thing you want to mention about the show or?

911
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,320
Well, first of all I just...

912
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,960
I love the show, guys.

913
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,320
I mean, I have a crappy internet connection here at the hotel but I can at least hear

914
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,320
the stream.

915
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,320
Thank you so much.

916
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,320
But other than that, I picked up a...

917
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:43,640
I got a DS Live I imported recently and I'm loving it.

918
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,080
How is that?

919
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,080
Is it...

920
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,080
That's great.

921
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,080
What makes it so much better than the original DS?

922
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:56,800
Well, I never touched the original DS so I liked this and it looked really cool.

923
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:04,320
I found it on eBay and I blew away Scott and Lawrence and I told him I got it for $99 off

924
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
of eBay.

925
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,320
Wow.

926
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,440
They actually had this for their demo unit for...

927
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,440
It was some really awful card game but it was...

928
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,960
I have to say that I enjoyed the brighter screen on it.

929
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,200
It felt a little bit easier.

930
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,080
Yeah, it was alright.

931
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,080
Alright.

932
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,600
Well, SilentWind96, we'll see you in a little bit and you're getting the hookup, man, because

933
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,760
this is an invite-only party tonight here.

934
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,760
In television.

935
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,760
Yeah.

936
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,760
The Mario Rock Opera is...

937
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,080
Mario Rock Opera is setting up.

938
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,400
They got a whole DJ thing down there.

939
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,400
I mean, there's stuff all over.

940
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,400
Yeah, Supernova Sound.

941
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,720
In television, everywhere, but there's new stuff, too, but who doesn't love these classics?

942
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,720
Okay.

943
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
It's great.

944
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,720
Get your butt down here right now.

945
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,720
Wait.

946
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,720
Where did I meet you?

947
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
Alright.

948
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,720
We'll see you in the details.

949
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,720
PM me in chat.

950
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,720
Alright.

951
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,720
Cool.

952
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,720
Have a good one, buddy.

953
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,720
Alright.

954
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,720
Talk to you later.

955
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,720
Thank you.

956
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,720
Alright.

957
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,720
Let's see.

958
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,720
Can we give out the number one more time?

959
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,720
I guess we'll do a couple more calls if there's anyone wants to call in.

960
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,840
1-866-8800156.

961
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,120
That is a toll-free number in the United States.

962
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,120
Okay.

963
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,080
And don't call in asking to get in free tonight because we just gave our one away, so that's

964
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,080
it.

965
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,080
We're done.

966
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,080
But here's the good news.

967
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:18,400
You can come Thursday or Friday and you can get in and, you know, it's a good time.

968
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,400
So if you still want to come down, Thursday and Friday we'll be here as well because we're

969
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
taping both nights.

970
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,400
Okay.

971
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,400
Where did we leave off?

972
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,400
Bobby.

973
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,320
Oh, Bobby's on the phone, so I'll go.

974
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,240
One thing I want to see tomorrow.

975
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,440
I didn't freaking touch the Wii, so I guess I'm going to have to wait in that.

976
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,440
You want to touch the Wii?

977
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,900
I want to touch Nintendo's Wii.

978
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:37,900
So bad.

979
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:43,880
So I'm going to wait in that horrible line and just get it over with so I can say I played

980
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,200
the damn Wii so I can come here and tell you all about it.

981
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,360
So that's essentially my day.

982
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:53,640
Otherwise, I didn't see anything in West Hall besides Sony and I know Tecmo's over there

983
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,400
and I know there's other booths over there I want to check out.

984
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:05,560
I would suggest going by Atlas for Disgaea 2 and Koei, of course, for Guitar Man Lives.

985
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:11,200
I want to play their Fatal in their show also.

986
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,200
Let's see.

987
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,320
I'm going to go over to chat here and see what's going on here.

988
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,300
Tiger Claw wants to know, are we going to be able to hear the Mario Rock Opera tonight

989
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,460
as well?

990
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:23,280
I think unfortunately they don't because Gamer Andy's going to be live somewhere else right

991
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,520
at that moment, right?

992
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,080
That was what that phone call was.

993
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,320
Oh, really?

994
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,320
They're not going to be live.

995
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,840
They cannot get it to work on Microsoft servers.

996
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,840
They're going to still record.

997
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,640
I apologize to all of Gamer Andy's fans in chat.

998
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,720
There are some in there.

999
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:40,120
All Games Interactive will be going on and they'll still have the show up on their podcast

1000
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,120
feed.

1001
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,120
Well, okay.

1002
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,120
So the Gamer Andy fans still have that.

1003
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,120
Right.

1004
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,240
And Gamer Andy will be here tomorrow night.

1005
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,520
Nice guy, Gamer Andy, and a lot of friends.

1006
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,520
He's got quite a click.

1007
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,520
They've got eight people.

1008
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,200
He's got a huge entourage.

1009
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,200
Gamerandy.com.

1010
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,200
And they've got the hookup.

1011
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,760
They played Gears of War.

1012
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,680
I was talking to Andy because they got behind closed doors at Microsoft and they played

1013
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,680
Gears of War.

1014
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,680
They said it's awesome.

1015
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,680
They're getting it.

1016
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,680
Yeah.

1017
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,880
Major Nelson was on their show tonight, right?

1018
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,880
I believe so.

1019
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,880
Yeah.

1020
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,680
And we were trying to rig it to get it to work and they just can't get it to work on

1021
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,680
their Wi-Fi over there.

1022
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,680
Frickin' technology.

1023
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,680
Yeah.

1024
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,680
All right.

1025
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,880
Bobby, what are you looking forward to doing tomorrow at the show?

1026
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,880
Wii.

1027
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,880
Wii.

1028
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,360
You're going to go Wii, Wii, Wii all the way home?

1029
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,680
No, just in the morning.

1030
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,720
Just going to go over there and wait, whatever, the two hours or whatever.

1031
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,720
You're going to go over and Wii in West Hall in the morning?

1032
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,720
Yeah.

1033
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,720
All right.

1034
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,720
Yeah, I'm going directly there.

1035
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,720
Right in the center of Nintendo's booth I'm going to Wii.

1036
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,720
Yeah.

1037
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,600
I'm going to go with my Wii and then because I really want to play the conducting game

1038
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,480
and that drum demo, you know, the virtual drum because I mean I'm a musician and I want

1039
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,360
to see if I'm any better at Miyamoto than he was at his conference.

1040
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,040
But other than that, you know, checking out more of Microsoft's booth, I really want to

1041
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,920
see Luminous Live just like you.

1042
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,920
Yeah.

1043
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,240
So that, you know, and I still got to go do Kensha Hall stuff for my show sometime.

1044
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,240
All right.

1045
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,000
Dark Soccer wants to address chat.

1046
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,560
Xander, she was asking about Fire Emblem.

1047
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:06,000
There were ads for Fire Emblem and it was there at Nintendo's press conference, but

1048
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,200
I didn't see anything playable for it.

1049
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,680
Then again, I didn't look too deep into the DS area, honestly.

1050
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,200
So I will go hunt out anything on Fire Emblem tomorrow I can.

1051
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,120
I know lots of people are interested in that series.

1052
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,120
I love the series.

1053
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,320
I can't play it for crap, but I love the series.

1054
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,080
So I will look up Fire Emblem stuff for y'all tomorrow.

1055
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,440
All right.

1056
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,040
What's done in chat right now is questioning is Super Smash Brothers, this new one, a real

1057
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,040
game?

1058
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,960
Or was it just a whole fan service thing?

1059
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,040
No, they have pictures from the conference with the people, with Miyamoto in the end.

1060
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,760
Yeah, I would think it's real.

1061
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,760
Oh, okay.

1062
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,760
Yeah.

1063
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,240
They say it in chat.

1064
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,240
I say it out loud.

1065
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,240
You know, that's what we do.

1066
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:52,160
I even have this cool montage where Snake is talking to Ocelot or whatever, you know,

1067
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,160
whatever his name.

1068
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,160
Otacon.

1069
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,160
Otacon.

1070
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,160
All right.

1071
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,960
Listen, I don't play Metal Gear Solid, so that's why I'm going to butcher everything.

1072
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,640
All I know is it's a game about a guy named, you know, Solid Snake, and that's as far as

1073
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,640
I go.

1074
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,800
Folks in chat want to know about Excite Truck.

1075
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,800
You guys saw it.

1076
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,800
I didn't.

1077
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,800
What do you think about Excite Truck?

1078
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,860
I want that game.

1079
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,800
It looks like burn or it looks like it scores like burnout.

1080
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,880
It's very interesting.

1081
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:23,480
The truck is extremely fast, so it's kind of like Excite Bike a little bit.

1082
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,480
Just very interesting.

1083
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,480
I don't know.

1084
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,920
No one seemed to be able to keep their truck on the road, but it looked fun.

1085
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,600
I like the way they do their scoring system.

1086
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:36,240
It's kind of like burnout where you get points for, you know, driving dangerously, catching

1087
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,320
a lot of air, going fast, being in first place, and that stuff, and they'll give you a ranking

1088
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:46,880
on the race, everything from, like, D to triple A, S. I don't know.

1089
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,000
They did say, though, that it wasn't, you weren't going to be able to do anything online

1090
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
with it.

1091
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
It's kind of dumb.

1092
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,880
I'm hoping that they have the whole, you know, build a level, save it, take it to your friend's

1093
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,880
house.

1094
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,760
Nintendo needs to do online, dammit.

1095
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,840
Get with the program.

1096
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:08,040
They did have Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam there, and I didn't get to play that or Tony Hawk's

1097
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:13,480
Project 8, which I have no idea what the hell Project 8 is, but I don't know.

1098
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,080
It should be good.

1099
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:23,520
Project Cammer was another game that they had at the Wii booths, and I didn't know,

1100
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,520
I'm not very interested in that game, to be honest.

1101
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,520
They had a Sonic game, though.

1102
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,800
Sonic, what was it, Wildfire?

1103
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,800
How was that?

1104
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,800
I didn't play it.

1105
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,800
Looked good, though.

1106
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,800
They had Bomberman.

1107
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,800
They had Bomberman, was there.

1108
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,800
And the Virtual Console.

1109
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,800
Super Monkey Ball.

1110
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,800
They had the Virtual Console.

1111
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,800
Virtual Console.

1112
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:46,800
They were playing them.

1113
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,800
I want to see it all.

1114
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,800
Tell me about it.

1115
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,800
Mario World.

1116
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,800
Tell me, tell me, tell me about it.

1117
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,800
How did it work?

1118
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,800
How does it look?

1119
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,200
I actually, I didn't get to check it out because I was feeling a little ill.

1120
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:02,040
We will have some, hopefully some pictures online soon of the Virtual Console, but in

1121
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:08,520
the meantime, if you are really, you know, trying to get a look at it, I believe Joystiq

1122
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:14,840
had pictures of it online and I'm trying to find the link so we can put it in chat, but

1123
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,840
it looked pretty cool.

1124
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:22,440
They had, on demo, they actually had the Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo.

1125
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:30,880
I think Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64, Bonk for the TurboGrafx, Sonic for the Genesis,

1126
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,080
of course, and Super Nintendo.

1127
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,200
They had Super Mario World.

1128
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,200
Super Mario World.

1129
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,600
So, definitely really cool looking.

1130
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:49,840
Yeah, it looks very solid, very sexy, very white, but here, now obviously this is not

1131
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:55,400
really great radio, but Rob, here's pictures of the Virtual Console on my laptop here.

1132
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,920
Oh, that's pretty hot.

1133
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,920
I like that.

1134
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,920
Yeah, I do like that.

1135
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,920
It's bigger than I thought.

1136
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,360
It's on a gadget, guys, if you want to go there.

1137
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,920
I thought it would have more games on the screen at once.

1138
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,920
That's kind of interesting.

1139
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,920
Yeah, so.

1140
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,360
A real quick plug for the websites, E3 on PSP.com, Loki, you've been updating that like

1141
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,360
a mofo, right?

1142
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,360
Uh-huh, I've been trying.

1143
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:18,400
I've been getting behind a little bit, but I do have some stuff there from actually the

1144
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,240
Nintendo party that I attended, which should be good.

1145
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,520
So we got some pictures of that.

1146
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,040
Let's come back to that in a minute.

1147
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,640
Dark Soccer, what sites have you been working on?

1148
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,960
Actually, I did a little blogging today on stuff.orangelandradio.com.

1149
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,040
Yeah, I have a backlog I'm going to post there soon, too.

1150
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:43,480
I just happened to go up to the press room just to relax for a little bit, and I figured

1151
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,080
I'd go ahead and update the stuff blog, so there's my initial impressions there.

1152
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:52,680
That was everything up until I headed back, actually right before I ran into you guys

1153
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,160
when I was coming out of the west.

1154
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,160
I'm sorry I'm all backwards today.

1155
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,160
I'm sorry.

1156
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:05,840
So yeah, if you want to check out just what my impression was as of that moment, I have

1157
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,440
a few details there.

1158
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:15,720
I had just also checked out Guitar Room Man at that point, and also there's a discussion

1159
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:23,400
going on in our live journal community at orangeland.livejournal.com.

1160
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,400
You can get there.

1161
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,640
I'm sure there's stuff going up on our MySpace.

1162
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:33,160
I haven't looked at MySpace all week, and there's various other discussions that we're

1163
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,880
involved with at different locations, just depends on where you happen to find it.

1164
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,280
Bobby, there's a question backlogged from chat from five minutes ago.

1165
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,840
Yeah, it was like Boston asked if we've ever had any random bumping with celebrities, and

1166
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,000
you were with me, Rob, when we saw this.

1167
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,520
Oh, how desperate somebody is for a paycheck.

1168
00:54:52,520 --> 00:55:00,600
We saw Gilbert Gottfried with G4 interviewing somebody in Kensha, and we're like, is he

1169
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,360
that desperate for a paycheck?

1170
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,440
I just rolled my eyes.

1171
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,640
I'm just like, I don't get it.

1172
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,440
I don't get G4 anymore, so whatever.

1173
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,440
I saw him in South Hall, and they were making him record, I guess, a bumper or something.

1174
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,440
He's all, I'm here at E3, man.

1175
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,720
I was supposed to be in Alaska or something like that.

1176
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,720
I was like, okay.

1177
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:25,320
The last thing I saw him do that wasn't an animated movie was USA Up All Night.

1178
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,320
Any other celebrity sightings?

1179
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:32,240
I don't know if this counts, but I got to meet Tommy Tallarico, thanks to Bobby.

1180
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,440
And Becky Young, who's smoking.

1181
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,720
Nice guy, but he had so much makeup on because he was doing the HDTV thing.

1182
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,280
Gameplay HD, which is on Voom, Disney Network.

1183
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,200
He looked like, who's that guy on Dancing with the Stars?

1184
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,200
George Hamilton?

1185
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,200
No, I'm teasing.

1186
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,200
He was very nice.

1187
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,200
I'm totally teasing.

1188
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,200
Very nice guy.

1189
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,200
Glad to meet him.

1190
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,200
Any other celebrity run-ins, you guys?

1191
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:03,000
I got to meet, well, I didn't get to meet him, but I saw the guy who worked on the DS

1192
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Castlevania games.

1193
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,760
And then, as I'm actually showing Rob my picture right now, I had my meeting, well, not necessarily

1194
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,840
that I actually got to meet him other than to say thank you, but Koji Kondo, I got his

1195
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,840
autograph.

1196
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:26,000
And I happened to be at the press line for Nintendo when they were doing an interview

1197
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
with Miyamoto.

1198
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,920
You've got a lot of great pictures there, Dark Sakura, you've got to get those on the

1199
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,920
site soon.

1200
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:37,040
I haven't figured out how to, because I'm actually using my, no, no, no, I don't want

1201
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,040
to do that.

1202
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,080
I'm actually using my camcorder as a camera, too.

1203
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,800
And I'm trying to get the picture to show Rob, there it is.

1204
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,800
Oh, Miyamoto!

1205
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,800
He's so goofy.

1206
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:53,320
I got a really good picture of Miyamoto, so that was really it.

1207
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,240
Loki, any other celebrity sightings for you?

1208
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,880
No, I didn't see anybody, I was looking, I didn't make it by the booth with Paris Hilton

1209
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,880
Disposal.

1210
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,880
Ah, fucker.

1211
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:08,040
Alright, going to chat room, chat.allgames.com for this week while we're live at the E3 Outpost.

1212
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:14,320
Xander wants to know, did we see In the Groove 2 consumer style, conspicuously absent from

1213
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,920
Red Octane's booth completely?

1214
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,720
All they have is Guitar Hero 2.

1215
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,840
I'll give you this, their booth is 50 times better than it was last year, but it's all

1216
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,840
Guitar Hero 2.

1217
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,840
They are not showing In the Groove in any capacity, so it's great.

1218
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,720
I didn't hear anything about the Activision deal either.

1219
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,720
You know what?

1220
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,720
You want to hear us?

1221
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,800
I overheard Activision people talking about the acquisition.

1222
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:39,360
As I was walking out of Kensha, I overheard Activision people talking about it.

1223
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,560
And they were just saying, they were just very happy about it.

1224
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,720
They were like, well, I'm glad we got them because someone was going to eventually, you

1225
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,520
know, it was basically the tone of the whole thing.

1226
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,760
So I don't know if I was supposed to hear that, but I did.

1227
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,800
Activision's very happy to be getting Red Octane.

1228
00:57:52,800 --> 00:58:05,320
So oh, my God, the puppies on IGN.com, the Smash Brothers, oh, my Lord, but I lost my

1229
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,320
train of thought.

1230
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,320
It's alright.

1231
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,800
Damn you for distracting me with puppy.

1232
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,800
Sorry.

1233
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,680
Just a quick programming note for those that are listening live, if you're tuning in right

1234
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,920
now because you're expecting to hear gamer Andy, unfortunately, they're having technical

1235
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,480
difficulties will not be able to do a live broadcast tonight.

1236
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,000
He will be doing a podcast on his normal podcast stream.

1237
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So check that out.

1238
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,280
However, all games interactive will be here live right after we wrap up in just a few

1239
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,280
minutes here.

1240
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,200
And there might be a lot of people on that, too, you know, I've got to pee so bad.

1241
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:42,280
I know it's excellent about this, but IGN has a thing about Super Smash Brothers Brawl

1242
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,280
in there.

1243
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:50,720
And they said it says actually that they wanted the decision to include Solid Snake is basically

1244
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:57,040
from when Kojima actually begged to have the Metal Gear character in the last Smash Brothers

1245
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,040
game.

1246
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,600
They said when asked about the possibility of Sonic the Hedgehog appearing in the game

1247
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,320
as well, they said there are possibilities for other third parties as well.

1248
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:12,400
And it may even maybe that even there are characters that might be included.

1249
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,240
But right now they're still, you know, in talks, so awesome.

1250
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:21,240
I was always hoping that they'd have a fighting game, including all the characters from different

1251
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,240
games.

1252
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,500
Well, the closest we had gotten before the Smash Brothers, well, there was Sonic the

1253
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,840
Fighters, which actually, you know, I didn't see that Sonic collection that they had last

1254
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:35,300
year where they had supposed to have all the old Saturn Sonic games.

1255
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:41,320
And all I got to say is if they make a new Kid Icarus game, that's going to look sweet.

1256
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,320
Oh, yeah.

1257
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,320
Wow.

1258
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,320
That looks great.

1259
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,320
Kid Icarus.

1260
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,320
Wow.

1261
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,320
We transitioned.

1262
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:54,520
Are we about ready to wrap up?

1263
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,520
Your producer left.

1264
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,520
Oh, it's all right.

1265
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,520
I'll go run and find him.

1266
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,520
OK.

1267
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,520
Thank you very much.

1268
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,720
We can just stay here for a little bit longer and be the fabulous Internet celebrities we

1269
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,720
are.

1270
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:08,440
The Nintendo Party, I just got a I just got a call on the phone, so I got to make this

1271
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,440
quick.

1272
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,440
OK.

1273
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,440
Let's hear about the Nintendo Party real quick.

1274
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,440
OK.

1275
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,440
So anyways, I went to the Nintendo Party.

1276
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,440
They had Black Eyed Peas playing.

1277
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,440
It was kind of interesting.

1278
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:21,680
I think those I missed the previous I didn't get to play games beforehand, but what's even

1279
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,880
more interesting on the way there, I saw a runaway bus smashed through two cars and into

1280
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,040
a telephone pole and then into a Rite Aid.

1281
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,040
So that was pretty awesome.

1282
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:38,520
Well, brutal, but the party wasn't really my thing because a lot of people I didn't

1283
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,520
know there.

1284
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,400
But all the big names, I guess, were there, even from Nintendo, of course, no one had

1285
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,400
a name badge or anything.

1286
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,080
So we didn't know who the hell it was, who all right.

1287
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:51,960
Well, that's going to do it about do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live

1288
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:52,960
at the E3 Outpost.

1289
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,160
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1290
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,160
Dark Sakura.

1291
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,960
I'd like to put out the funny deal that Captain N wasn't really an intended character.

1292
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,240
And the show sucked.

1293
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,440
So reject false icons.

1294
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,440
Final thought.

1295
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,440
Loki.

1296
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:15,240
Stay tuned on E3 on the PSP.com and definitely going to have a lot more stuff on there.

1297
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:20,420
I'm just kind of backlogged and getting everything on there, lots more videos and a lot more

1298
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,420
everything.

1299
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:22,560
So keep watching.

1300
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,840
Final thought, Mr. Bobby Black Wolf and plug your site already.

1301
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,180
BobbyBlackWolfShow.com.

1302
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:33,080
We're going to have our E3 show is Friday night, 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific right

1303
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,280
before OLR.

1304
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,000
But I hope all three of you at least show up for a couple minutes at least.

1305
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,860
And actually, you guys should check out the Tuesday night episode of All Games Interactive.

1306
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,560
It has both Sky and Dark Sakura on it as well.

1307
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,560
Good times.

1308
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,560
Good times.

1309
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,560
Yes.

1310
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,560
Debating with Scott Rubin was a good time.

1311
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,400
And you guys can do it again tonight after you pee.

1312
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,280
I've got to wee in the worst way.

1313
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,280
That's my final thought.

1314
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,280
30 minutes.

1315
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,960
It's a different nature game bar that Rob gave me, I haven't eaten since 10, so.

1316
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,960
I need to drink.

1317
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,960
All right.

1318
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,960
We're going to wrap it up here.

1319
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,640
For those of you guys listening live, stay tuned.

1320
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,000
All Games Interactive coming up in about 30 minutes.

1321
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
About 30.

We'll have another podcast here tomorrow live for the E3 Outpost.

1325
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,280
