1
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:15,754
and many more.

2
00:00:40,652 --> 00:00:41,993
Thank you for watching!

3
00:01:10,097 --> 00:01:15,881
Thanks for watching!

4
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:39,710
Thanks for watching!

5
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,687
Thank you for watching!

6
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,441
Thanks for watching!

7
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,915
Thanks for watching!

8
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:38,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Mention the fact that you nearly fell off the chair.

9
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:40,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how I almost fell into the wall.

10
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:43,443
[SPEAKER_01]: An extra person here talking about using it as a battery for your vibrator.

11
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:44,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about Wondershowsin.

12
00:03:44,743 --> 00:03:46,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, let's talk about Wondershowsin.

13
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:48,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I just took over the show.

14
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:50,704
[SPEAKER_04]: How about that?

15
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:52,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Wondershowsin is awesome.

16
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:55,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you Wondershowsin?

17
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:58,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're so awesome.

18
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a hot dog.

19
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:01,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you're cool.

20
00:04:04,304 --> 00:04:08,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, not as cool as Wondershoes, which is your fairly hot.

21
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:12,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I am moderately hot.

22
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:23,300
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway... Hey everybody, I just took over the show.

23
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:24,241
[SPEAKER_04]: How's about that?

24
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:28,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody should tell me how cool I am.

25
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:29,146
[SPEAKER_04]: You start.

26
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to do this again.

27
00:04:33,094 --> 00:04:35,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was great.

28
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:38,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the kid that was dressed up like Hitler.

29
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:42,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Trevor is the best beat kid on that show.

30
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:43,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for returning, Rob.

31
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the kid about pills, though.

32
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:46,557
[SPEAKER_04]: He's my favorite.

33
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:47,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Pills!

34
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:47,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Pills!

35
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:48,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Pills!

36
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:49,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut up.

37
00:04:49,717 --> 00:04:53,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the power brick should be bigger than the PSP.

38
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:57,939
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be like a 360 or an Xbox that you just slap to the back of the PSP.

39
00:04:58,407 --> 00:04:59,888
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be a nuclear generator.

40
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:03,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the power packs in Ghostbusters.

41
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:06,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Power bricks made out of solid metal.

42
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:09,858
[SPEAKER_06]: It just gets super hot and you can cook eggs on it.

43
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:11,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Mmm, eggs.

44
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:13,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Mmm, eggy.

45
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:15,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

46
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:17,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, is this thing on?

47
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:18,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Testing.

48
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Testing 1-2.

49
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:24,875
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

50
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:25,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

51
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand this.

52
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:28,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this thing work?

53
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,561
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing reads like stereo instructions.

54
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:31,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this on?

55
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:31,862
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell?

56
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:38,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio, Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.

57
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:38,589
[SPEAKER_05]: What the?

58
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,334
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of our old promos.

59
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:42,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta love that.

60
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:43,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, RetroOLR.

61
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:44,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed the beep.

62
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:46,937
[SPEAKER_03]: The beep was from R10K.

63
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:49,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, alright.

64
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:49,759
[SPEAKER_05]: No, for reals.

65
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:51,780
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta get through this or I swear to God we'll be here all night.

66
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here we go.

67
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:54,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was QQQ.

68
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:55,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, shut up.

69
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:56,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody, shut up.

70
00:05:56,963 --> 00:05:57,403
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my time.

71
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki has this look at, you're gonna fuck up.

72
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:01,626
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna fuck up.

73
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:04,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I fucked up.

74
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,107
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't doing anything.

75
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:08,207
[SPEAKER_06]: You were giving me that look.

76
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:10,308
[SPEAKER_05]: You were like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

77
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:12,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not doing anything.

78
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:14,530
[SPEAKER_04]: You willed it to happen.

79
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:17,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just watching him talk.

80
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to God I quit.

81
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:20,993
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

82
00:06:22,393 --> 00:06:24,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo-hoo, we have DarkSakura Radio.

83
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:24,955
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, no, we don't.

84
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:25,895
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here we go.

85
00:06:30,342 --> 00:06:31,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not even looking at you.

86
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:33,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you know what?

87
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuckin' A. I'm turning around.

88
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:38,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm turning around.

89
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:39,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude.

90
00:06:41,806 --> 00:06:43,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do we have you on this program anyway?

91
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:49,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is you talking.

92
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

93
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's DarkSakura.

94
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:53,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Right at you.

95
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,915
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, how am I not supposed to laugh at that?

96
00:06:57,955 --> 00:07:01,977
[SPEAKER_03]: For the sake of the chat room, I was leaning over my laptop, staring at Rob intently.

97
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,178
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to be a duck.

98
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

99
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:09,815
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a drunk show.

100
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:10,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop filming.

101
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to turn around and not look at you people so I can get through this segment.

102
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,662
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki, be ready with a Tomb Raider story and no more giggling.

103
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:20,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we have a Tomb Raider story.

104
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:20,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here we go.

105
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:23,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

106
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:24,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

107
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:25,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.

108
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:25,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

109
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Know how Bobby Black by himself.

110
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm starting to wonder if that's not a bad idea.

111
00:07:30,731 --> 00:07:31,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pushing your head.

112
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:34,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

113
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:35,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

114
00:07:58,615 --> 00:08:00,876
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're back here with the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth.

115
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:03,638
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that portion of the show that's too hot to podcast.

116
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:04,618
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sticky.

117
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,259
[SPEAKER_05]: It's perverted.

118
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:13,503
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the cage match coming up, which is pretty much going to be just about all we do tonight because we're already at 9 o'clock.

119
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:15,004
[SPEAKER_05]: That was an awfully long show tonight.

120
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:18,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if you would quit laughing so much during the show.

121
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:18,866
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

122
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:20,387
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the show itself.

123
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,929
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes out on the stream, don't stop it.

124
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:28,170
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes out on the podcast stream, it won't be very long, but it was like 20 minutes of giggle fits.

125
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:28,971
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

126
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I recorded it on my fancy video camera.

127
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:32,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what is it?

128
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:35,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to do a video cast then?

129
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:37,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the next step?

130
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:38,174
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

131
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:41,175
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to, but this is mainly for E3.

132
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:42,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Get me a burka then.

133
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:49,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as we know, we were talking about what we're doing, our plans for E3, special plans that no one's doing yet.

134
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:55,579
[SPEAKER_06]: That's mainly what it's for, so I can walk through the entire booth and cover everything and that kind of stuff.

135
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:57,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that video camera.

136
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:02,428
[SPEAKER_06]: The only problem is the still pictures it takes aren't 100% good.

137
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:06,229
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like 640x480, not really even a 1 megapixel.

138
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:13,171
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I figured I'm cropping down most of the pictures anyways, I don't think it really matters.

139
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:14,971
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

140
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:18,612
[SPEAKER_06]: But it'll be pretty cool.

141
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:26,969
[SPEAKER_05]: In random news, it's Bomani related, Sephiroth1215 sent me a private message in chat.

142
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:28,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you don't mind me sharing that.

143
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,630
[SPEAKER_05]: But he sent me a link over to Konami's website here.

144
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,711
[SPEAKER_05]: And Konami has a page here for DDR Supernova.

145
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,192
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says, release date, available now.

146
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:38,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Lies.

147
00:09:38,553 --> 00:09:41,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a webmaster at Konami that's about to get fired.

148
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:41,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray.

149
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you email somebody about that?

150
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:44,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would I email anybody about that?

151
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:45,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't you fix that?

152
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,076
[SPEAKER_05]: You work for him?

153
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:48,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't you fire somebody?

154
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:49,257
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

155
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:54,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent you a link to my Flash thingy and you never said anything.

156
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:55,515
[SPEAKER_05]: When?

157
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent you an IM a few days ago.

158
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:00,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Was I at work?

159
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:01,860
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because he's rude.

160
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,541
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

161
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And I leave my IM up.

162
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to pull it up and I'm going to show you on my laptop.

163
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:09,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know you need to friend me now once you get a game.

164
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:11,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I get a game.

165
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:12,849
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even have to get a game.

166
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:16,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy some of those Xbox Live arcade games.

167
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:17,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll probably get Geometry Wars.

168
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:21,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you download the ghost recon thing or something?

169
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:22,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I'm busy.

170
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:23,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to me later.

171
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to do a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, but I don't think I really care about these people anymore.

172
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:36,036
[SPEAKER_05]: So, let's get into tonight's cage match, shall we?

173
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:37,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what were you talking about?

174
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:38,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm not busy.

175
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:41,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put that on my resume and I want you to have people hire me.

176
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:43,588
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

177
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:14,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Cache Match!

178
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I vote for Holic.

179
00:11:18,246 --> 00:11:18,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna get busted.

180
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:20,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Three songs, do battle.

181
00:11:22,006 --> 00:11:25,028
[SPEAKER_05]: and now I have the giggles again.

182
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:26,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Three songs do battle.

183
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:28,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Each host picks their favorite song.

184
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Cage Match.

185
00:11:30,011 --> 00:11:30,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

186
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:32,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Three hosts pick their favorite song.

187
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:33,113
[SPEAKER_05]: They do battle.

188
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:35,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Your guys' votes in the chat room determine the winner.

189
00:11:35,774 --> 00:11:41,177
[SPEAKER_05]: And it goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music program.

190
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:44,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Started off with song number one, which won the Cage Match last week.

191
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:44,959
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Babyland.

192
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?

193
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Babyland, who I'm going to see on April 15th in Berkeley.

194
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:53,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Babyland had this song called Gary?

195
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:55,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that how you say it?

196
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:55,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Gary?

197
00:11:55,803 --> 00:11:56,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Gary, Gary.

198
00:11:57,044 --> 00:12:00,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well it won last week's Cage Match with its funky indie sound.

199
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:03,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I said it sounded like the Postal Service on crack or something, I don't remember.

200
00:12:04,165 --> 00:12:04,545
[SPEAKER_05]: But here it is.

201
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:08,546
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of their stuff is more industrial sounding, but this I thought was very synth poppy.

202
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:09,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here it is.

203
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:10,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

204
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:12,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number one, Babyland.

205
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:13,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

206
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:23,576
Thank you for watching!

207
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:11,442
Thanks for watching!

208
00:13:46,778 --> 00:13:50,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, song number two in tonight's cage match is coming up.

209
00:13:50,284 --> 00:13:53,750
[SPEAKER_05]: That, once again, was song number one, Babyland, with Jerry.

210
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:59,360
[SPEAKER_05]: And song number two is going to be a challenger, and it's my pick.

211
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a band called Goldfrap.

212
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:04,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I think Goldfrap is just the name of the girl.

213
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:06,955
[SPEAKER_05]: You know she's got a lot of people helping her out.

214
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:10,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Goldfrap has a song from her new CD, Supernature is the CD.

215
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:12,759
[SPEAKER_05]: The song is called Ooh La La.

216
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:14,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like this song.

217
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,041
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of pornotastic.

218
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:17,002
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's my pick tonight.

219
00:14:17,342 --> 00:14:18,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh La La by Goldfrap.

220
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:19,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

221
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:20,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Or don't.

222
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:20,685
[SPEAKER_05]: See if I care.

223
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:29,491
Ooh La La

224
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:58,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to touch you, you're just made for love

225
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:18,212
Thanks for watching!

226
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:02,020
That was it, that was uh...

227
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:33,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number two there in the cage match, Ooh La La by GoldFrap.

228
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that ending, though.

229
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:39,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know what, that was part of a song I'm not supposed to be playing.

230
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:44,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoops!

231
00:17:44,338 --> 00:17:49,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, what did you guys think of Ooh La La by GoldFrap?

232
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:52,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov, she needs to quit smoking, one.

233
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what did you think of Oolala by GoldPrap?

234
00:17:58,022 --> 00:18:00,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I recognized... I don't know, it was okay.

235
00:18:01,084 --> 00:18:02,986
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good stripper music, I guess.

236
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:05,848
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be called GoldFap.

237
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it would be like 7.5.

238
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:13,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, how would you rate the bathroom?

239
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:14,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Or wherever you just were.

240
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:17,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I could hear the music from the bathroom, thank you.

241
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:18,138
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you like?

242
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:19,419
[SPEAKER_03]: It was poopy.

243
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,462
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

244
00:18:22,922 --> 00:18:25,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually liked what I heard of it.

245
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:28,507
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little repetitive, but it gets an 8.

246
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,889
[SPEAKER_05]: That is totally fucking music.

247
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I give it a 9.

248
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:36,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit, I forgot kids listen to this show, my bad.

249
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:40,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, song number three tonight comes from Cheater Loki.

250
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheater, Cheater, Cheater Loki.

251
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:43,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, listen.

252
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not support Cheater Loki tonight.

253
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, I did the same thing when Kingdom Hearts 1 came out, okay?

254
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:55,118
[SPEAKER_06]: So obviously my choice is going to be Utada Hikaru with Passion, because that is a team song.

255
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here's song number three from Cheating Loki.

256
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:01,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Utada Hikaru with Passion.

257
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:02,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

258
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:18,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

259
00:19:53,937 --> 00:19:56,039
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

260
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:52,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

261
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:14,295
Thank you for watching!

262
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,828
Thank you for watching!

263
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:40,135
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

264
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, song number three tonight, Utada Hikaru with Passion.

265
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:48,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that.

266
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:49,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Who started us off last time?

267
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:50,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Miklatov.

268
00:23:51,203 --> 00:23:53,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It was long and had bad camera angles.

269
00:23:53,484 --> 00:23:54,245
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a one.

270
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:55,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

271
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:58,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that song.

272
00:23:58,707 --> 00:24:00,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the guitar.

273
00:24:00,228 --> 00:24:03,130
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing I remember of it each time.

274
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:07,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet you used the version without the guitar bridge in the middle, like in the opening video.

275
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:08,864
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

276
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:10,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I was pressed for time.

277
00:24:10,806 --> 00:24:12,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I had a feeling.

278
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:13,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a hunch.

279
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:16,350
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

280
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

281
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:19,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave it a 9.

282
00:24:20,153 --> 00:24:20,713
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

283
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:30,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like this song, although as far as I thought that Hikaru was better as far as an opening song.

284
00:24:31,381 --> 00:24:31,541
[SPEAKER_03]: This...

285
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:38,352
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I really like the song, it's a problem, but I just don't like things about it.

286
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,093
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gets a 7.

287
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the opening song to Kingdom Hearts 2 should have been Easy Breezy.

288
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:47,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think that would have been much better.

289
00:24:47,294 --> 00:24:49,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, you could have like Sora skipping down.

290
00:24:49,435 --> 00:24:51,636
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as dramatic.

291
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:52,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, no, I...

292
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:58,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that song a lot, but it's already in rotation, so I give it a five.

293
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:02,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, don't get me wrong, I love that song, but Loki sucks.

294
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:05,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

295
00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:10,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Babyland with Jerry, song number one.

296
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:27,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and song number two you can vote for tonight is Gold Frap with Ooh La La is the name of that song.

297
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:42,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is from Loki, and it's Utada Hikaru with Passion.

298
00:25:45,572 --> 00:25:45,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't listening.

299
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:16,363
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura has a memory like an elephant.

300
00:26:16,863 --> 00:26:19,406
[SPEAKER_05]: She don't forget.

301
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:21,668
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a slightly different version.

302
00:26:21,688 --> 00:26:23,309
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you talking about?

303
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:23,930
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't forget.

304
00:26:26,873 --> 00:26:27,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

305
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:30,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the one we have in rotation does have the guitar riff.

306
00:26:30,396 --> 00:26:31,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the one from the movie.

307
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:32,979
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the short one.

308
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:33,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Sigh.

309
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:36,415
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

310
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:41,378
[SPEAKER_03]: And, dude, I'm going to hit FoodManiac64 with a trout now for being a butt.

311
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:41,978
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

312
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:42,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Do so.

313
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:46,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he told everyone not to vote for my song so they'd play his.

314
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:48,942
[SPEAKER_03]: But I haven't guaranteed that I'll play his song.

315
00:26:48,962 --> 00:26:49,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

316
00:26:49,222 --> 00:26:52,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I told people I'd play their songs like three months ago, and I still haven't.

317
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Just keep dangling out there.

318
00:26:54,105 --> 00:26:55,385
[SPEAKER_01]: He emailed me four times.

319
00:26:55,725 --> 00:26:56,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell him to stop.

320
00:26:56,526 --> 00:26:57,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Block him.

321
00:26:58,567 --> 00:26:58,747
Ah.

322
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:00,608
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

323
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, since I need some time here to tabulate votes, I need filler, so we're gonna go around and do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

324
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:08,315
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how was your week, how was your day?

325
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:09,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Shitty!

326
00:27:09,556 --> 00:27:10,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, poopy.

327
00:27:12,478 --> 00:27:14,039
[SPEAKER_03]: No, my week was actually pretty good.

328
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:15,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got more stuff to do.

329
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:23,226
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my whole crappy work situation has improved to such a degree that I no longer feel like I'm going to kill people and then myself in a big emo fit.

330
00:27:23,846 --> 00:27:28,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, I just feel like, you know, I'm going to mildly maim people and, you know, not, like, actually kill them, you know.

331
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm no longer disgruntled.

332
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:33,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm slightly annoyed, but not disgruntled.

333
00:27:36,276 --> 00:27:38,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also been playing a lot of Ragnarok online.

334
00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:43,619
[SPEAKER_03]: As of today, my primary character is 5441.

335
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:50,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have to get job 50 before I can go assassin.

336
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:54,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I donated some money to their server, so I got a bunch of free stuff for it.

337
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:56,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a kiddie band now, and it makes me a very happy bunny.

338
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a kitty band.

339
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:04,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to see pictures.

340
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:06,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I will send you pictures.

341
00:28:07,442 --> 00:28:08,642
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got a bunch of cards too.

342
00:28:08,702 --> 00:28:11,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a thief bug card and no footwear that I can put it on.

343
00:28:13,803 --> 00:28:14,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I need a zombie card.

344
00:28:17,504 --> 00:28:18,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Because zombies are awesome.

345
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:19,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a hot dog.

346
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:23,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your week?

347
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:23,366
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your day?

348
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,773
[SPEAKER_06]: My weekend day was okay.

349
00:28:26,374 --> 00:28:35,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to move my desk tomorrow because we do this thing every once in a while once we fire a bunch of people where we do the floor layout shuffle.

350
00:28:36,544 --> 00:28:37,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are fun.

351
00:28:38,346 --> 00:28:40,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for no apparent reason.

352
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,873
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll move people one desk over just...

353
00:28:45,774 --> 00:28:46,635
[SPEAKER_06]: for the hell of it.

354
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:47,857
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of fun.

355
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:49,981
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, so I gotta move my desk.

356
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:56,410
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get my review next week, which should be interesting because my phone time sucks, but I'm the smartest one there.

357
00:28:56,671 --> 00:28:58,894
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it kind of evens out.

358
00:28:59,495 --> 00:28:59,996
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um...

359
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:01,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

360
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:02,571
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be cool.

361
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:03,972
[SPEAKER_06]: We're supposed to be getting our bonuses.

362
00:29:05,213 --> 00:29:11,979
[SPEAKER_06]: My co-worker taught me this really cool thing with our bonus because they take out twice the amount of taxes as they normally would on your bonus checks.

363
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:17,243
[SPEAKER_06]: So where I potentially could get $2,000, I only get like $1,100 or something.

364
00:29:17,703 --> 00:29:22,987
[SPEAKER_06]: So what you do is you put out another W4 or whatever for...

365
00:29:25,322 --> 00:29:30,245
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, exempt for that week, so I get my full $2,000, which is going to a laptop.

366
00:29:30,565 --> 00:29:34,407
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um... What else?

367
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:38,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I got my spiffy camera, which you'll hopefully see some more content for the PSP site.

368
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:47,075
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the, uh... One of the main reasons was for that, so I can record some of my stuff at, you know... Well, I'm probably going to record stuff at my bachelor party, because...

369
00:29:48,373 --> 00:29:50,654
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens at Bachelor Party stays at Bachelor Party.

370
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:55,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And also... Do you know what they have planned for your Bachelor Party?

371
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,557
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't.

372
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:59,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I do, but that's all I can say.

373
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

374
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:05,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, the other thing is just your recording wedding stuff.

375
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:10,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Just it's really fun to play with that camera because it has a 20 gig hard drive in there so you can store tons of video.

376
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:13,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of video coming from E3, that's for sure.

377
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:15,967
[SPEAKER_06]: So look forward to that and lots of pictures.

378
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:17,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

379
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:20,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's about all I have.

380
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:22,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Mikotov, how was your week?

381
00:30:23,396 --> 00:30:24,637
[SPEAKER_04]: My week was boring.

382
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:26,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Work is boring.

383
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:27,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sick of it.

384
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:36,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And then today, slash last night, got myself hyped up to go to Best Buy and wait in a non-existent line at 3 in the morning.

385
00:30:37,606 --> 00:30:38,927
[SPEAKER_04]: That didn't go so well.

386
00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:41,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Best Buy sucks.

387
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:50,035
[SPEAKER_04]: And then tomorrow, somebody new that we hired is going to be sitting in my office and I'm not looking forward to that because I hate new people and I will not talk to them.

388
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:53,009
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not a team player.

389
00:30:53,489 --> 00:30:55,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to be a team player.

390
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,131
[SPEAKER_04]: They invaded my space.

391
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:58,471
[SPEAKER_04]: They can go away.

392
00:30:59,832 --> 00:31:04,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I, um... Oh, we started playing Tetris DS at work.

393
00:31:05,295 --> 00:31:06,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's over already.

394
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:09,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of people suck and whine too much like me.

395
00:31:09,857 --> 00:31:10,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to Apples and Apples.

396
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:12,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Apples to Apples is occasionally played.

397
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:16,841
[SPEAKER_04]: We recently discovered the joy of Team Mario Kart.

398
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:18,161
[SPEAKER_04]: at break.

399
00:31:18,601 --> 00:31:19,141
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really fun.

400
00:31:19,161 --> 00:31:19,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Team Mario Kart.

401
00:31:19,902 --> 00:31:21,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and reverses.

402
00:31:21,382 --> 00:31:26,403
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're setting up the options like 150 and computer difficulty if you have computers and all that, there's an option for team.

403
00:31:26,983 --> 00:31:29,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can actually do a four-on-four team.

404
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:41,527
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's pretty much like a regular race, except you have a color icon, like red or blue, and you can still attack your own teammates, but how it works is it's an overall point total for your team.

405
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:42,387
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

406
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:44,607
[SPEAKER_04]: You're no longer working just to be the best.

407
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:45,868
[SPEAKER_04]: You're working as a team.

408
00:31:45,968 --> 00:31:46,148
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

409
00:31:47,267 --> 00:31:52,750
[SPEAKER_04]: We started out last week when the losers were still playing Tetris, me and the person in my room, or in my office.

410
00:31:53,431 --> 00:32:03,557
[SPEAKER_04]: We played it with computers and he got screwed over twice with really bad computer players, but it's really fun actually, and I didn't even think Mario Kart could be more fun than it already was.

411
00:32:03,857 --> 00:32:04,958
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

412
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:26,401
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we're playing without power-ups because, you know, they got pissed off at that because I won the rankings this month.

413
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:34,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So this next month now, we're just trying to... I want to do team games, but the problem is we don't get enough people to participate.

414
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:39,810
[SPEAKER_06]: You can only do six, and some people are gone or busy and stuff, and that kind of makes it unfair.

415
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:45,173
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I don't know, we're looking forward to, like, maybe Liberty City Stories when it comes out on PlayStation 2.

416
00:32:45,373 --> 00:32:49,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully we'll have multiplayer, and then we can land together some PS2s and play it that way.

417
00:32:50,797 --> 00:32:51,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

418
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:52,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Might be fun.

419
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:53,058
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be fun.

420
00:32:54,998 --> 00:32:56,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, how was your weekend?

421
00:32:56,879 --> 00:32:57,499
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fine.

422
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides the whole male PMS thing, I was fine.

423
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a fine week.

424
00:33:01,921 --> 00:33:07,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to the gym today and my trainer pretty much told me officially today that I'm fat, which was good to hear.

425
00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:10,638
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was referring to.

426
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:13,161
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I had to take the little machine that measures your body fat.

427
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:15,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And you hold it in your hands like away from your body.

428
00:33:15,483 --> 00:33:16,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

429
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:17,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And it did the little boop, boop, boop thing.

430
00:33:17,405 --> 00:33:18,086
[SPEAKER_03]: The BMI scale.

431
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:18,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, and then I turned it.

432
00:33:19,107 --> 00:33:21,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, and he looked at the number and then he turned it around and said.

433
00:33:21,997 --> 00:33:24,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, you're right here in the high one.

434
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, thanks.

435
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,320
[SPEAKER_05]: But oh well.

436
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:28,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I already knew that was coming anyway.

437
00:33:28,502 --> 00:33:31,144
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the whole reason I signed up for the gym.

438
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:34,726
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just have to make sure I go regularly.

439
00:33:34,827 --> 00:33:36,328
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool that you have a trainer, though.

440
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,949
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the only thing I'd be able to do.

441
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:40,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I only get them one more time for free.

442
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:41,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'd have to pay for them if I want to keep them.

443
00:33:41,872 --> 00:33:44,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, if you come to my gym with me, I'll work out with you and show you what to do.

444
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:51,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that I don't know what to do, I just, you know, I need the motivation is a huge thing.

445
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:53,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Put a cupcake in front of you.

446
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:59,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise you, next Monday, nothing will stand in between us going to spin.

447
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:00,008
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

448
00:34:00,828 --> 00:34:01,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Word.

449
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,109
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they do spin at this gym, too.

450
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:05,490
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to go to my trainer's spin.

451
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,731
[SPEAKER_05]: She's vicious.

452
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:11,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked my trainer if you could come to this club, and he said with a guest pass you can.

453
00:34:12,113 --> 00:34:14,754
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll have to come to one of our classes sometime, see if you enjoy it.

454
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:15,674
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

455
00:34:15,714 --> 00:34:16,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring me a guest pass.

456
00:34:16,614 --> 00:34:16,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

457
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:17,755
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it.

458
00:34:17,835 --> 00:34:18,175
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on.

459
00:34:18,835 --> 00:34:20,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll pick a class to do.

460
00:34:20,396 --> 00:34:21,816
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the summer we can go swimming.

461
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:22,937
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do yoga or something.

462
00:34:23,097 --> 00:34:24,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I got all the stuff to do lap swimming.

463
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:30,673
[SPEAKER_05]: They're outdoors, though.

464
00:34:30,754 --> 00:34:32,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was indoors when I signed up.

465
00:34:32,334 --> 00:34:36,555
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the ones I have a membership for over here has a lap pool outside.

466
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:37,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the snooty one, though.

467
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:40,116
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to do the indoor pool somewhere.

468
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:41,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Roseville.

469
00:34:42,137 --> 00:34:42,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to Roseville.

470
00:34:42,937 --> 00:34:45,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Roseville has three indoor pools.

471
00:34:45,678 --> 00:34:46,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hi.

472
00:34:48,278 --> 00:34:50,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Shall we announce who won tonight's cage match?

473
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:52,540
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a good way to get close to the end here.

474
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

475
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,541
[SPEAKER_05]: The winning song of tonight's cage match was...

476
00:34:57,441 --> 00:34:58,422
[SPEAKER_05]: A tie!

477
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:02,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And here are the two songs... Okay, you know how ties work.

478
00:35:02,945 --> 00:35:04,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's song number one that tied.

479
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:06,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Baby Man.

480
00:35:09,249 --> 00:35:10,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's song number two that tied.

481
00:35:13,972 --> 00:35:15,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Passion, Utada Hikaru.

482
00:35:16,754 --> 00:35:20,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the old Orange Lounge Radio rulebook... I wonder where this is going.

483
00:35:20,497 --> 00:35:24,480
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that when two songs tie, the host who got screwed over... Oh, that's me.

484
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Gets to break the tie...

485
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:30,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, see, I could be ironic and vote for your pick, Loki.

486
00:35:31,224 --> 00:35:32,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Jamie could hate me all night.

487
00:35:33,245 --> 00:35:33,985
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be fun.

488
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:43,709
[SPEAKER_05]: But, no, I can't do that because, you know, you totally picked a song that was already in rotation, so I think you both end up winning anyway.

489
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:51,913
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am picking for Jamie's song, I'm picking Jamie's song, Babyland, because I like the fact that they sound like Postal Service on track.

490
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:54,294
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so two weeks in a row.

491
00:35:55,535 --> 00:35:55,935
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

492
00:35:57,748 --> 00:35:58,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Babyland for the win!

493
00:35:59,229 --> 00:36:00,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Two weeks in a row, not too shabby.

494
00:36:01,431 --> 00:36:03,512
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody has to go to their show in Berkeley.

495
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:05,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the stripper song was only one vote behind.

496
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was close.

497
00:36:07,355 --> 00:36:08,196
[SPEAKER_03]: We were all up there.

498
00:36:08,776 --> 00:36:10,077
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all winners.

499
00:36:10,217 --> 00:36:11,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Except Rob's not as much of a winner.

500
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:16,362
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one vote for Pat, that one song, one vote for Jamie's song, and zero votes for yours.

501
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:18,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, something like that.

502
00:36:19,522 --> 00:36:21,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was both of our listeners right there.

503
00:36:21,783 --> 00:36:22,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.

504
00:36:22,423 --> 00:36:24,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, it's about 9.30 and I think it's time to call it a night.

505
00:36:24,784 --> 00:36:25,445
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you kids think?

506
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:26,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I want ice cream.

507
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:27,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thirsty.

508
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:27,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hungry.

509
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:29,507
I want a cupcake.

510
00:36:32,448 --> 00:36:34,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're... No, I think I ate the last one.

511
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Bastard!

512
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:37,830
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's fine.

513
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I need... Oh, I want Boba.

514
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:41,532
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 23rd Magus.

515
00:36:41,572 --> 00:36:42,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear you there.

516
00:36:42,893 --> 00:36:45,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know, TAPEX is open.

517
00:36:47,107 --> 00:36:47,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it!

518
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:48,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it, all of you!

519
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:52,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got told I'm fat today!

520
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:54,694
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get you some nice wheatgrass.

521
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:55,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want wheatgrass.

522
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:58,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I want bulimia right about now.

523
00:36:58,657 --> 00:36:59,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

524
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:02,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Then fine, I'll get you a bottle of Ipecac.

525
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:03,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

526
00:37:04,602 --> 00:37:05,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And a toothbrush.

527
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:09,886
[SPEAKER_05]: That's disgusting.

528
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:11,868
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you wanted bulimia.

529
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:15,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sorry chat room, I ignored your FUs tonight, maybe next week.

530
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:21,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight was supposed to be a slow news night, we went on forever, but of course I think that little giggle fit had something to do with it.

531
00:37:21,545 --> 00:37:22,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Your giggle fit, okay Rob.

532
00:37:22,165 --> 00:37:22,866
[SPEAKER_03]: My giggle fit?

533
00:37:22,886 --> 00:37:25,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you were the only one laughing in the microphone.

534
00:37:25,268 --> 00:37:26,188
[SPEAKER_03]: We were laughing at you.

535
00:37:26,248 --> 00:37:28,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I have your giggle fit on camera, so.

536
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, shut up.

537
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Partial.

538
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:30,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here it is.

539
00:37:30,892 --> 00:37:32,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Your fortune cookie message.

540
00:37:32,093 --> 00:37:34,034
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost said your moment of zen.

541
00:37:34,054 --> 00:37:35,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Your fortune cookie message.

542
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:35,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you still want to be a duck?

543
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:36,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the day.

544
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:38,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to be a duck.

545
00:37:41,479 --> 00:38:01,134
[SPEAKER_07]: We're tiny, we're toony, we're all a little loony And in this cartoony, we're invading your TV We're comic dispensers, we crack up all the censors On I'm a Toon Adventures, get a dose of comedy So here's at the anchors, it's a whole wide world apart Our homes, we only stand alone, a cartoon work of art

547
