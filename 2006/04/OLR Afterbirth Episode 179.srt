1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
...

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
...

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
...

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
...

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
...

7
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
["Pomp and Circumstance"]

8
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:38,400
You mentioned the fact that, uh, you nearly fell off the chair.

9
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't know how I almost fell into the wall, but that was just fun.

10
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And the extra person here talking about using it as a battery for your vibrator.

11
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's talk about Wonder Shows Inn.

12
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh yeah, let's talk about Wonder Shows Inn.

13
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I think I just took over the show. How about that?

14
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay, Wonder Shows Inn is awesome.

15
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They told me how cool I am. Okay you start.

16
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,440
are you under shows in yeah then you're so awesome like a hot dog I don't think

17
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,200
you're cool sorry not fairly hot cools wonder shows

18
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Yeah, which is great. You're fairly hot.

19
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
I am. I am moderately hot.

20
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
So, anyway.

21
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Hey, everybody. I just took over the show. How's about that?

22
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,200
You took over the show? I think everybody should tell me how cool I am.

23
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
You start.

24
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
I'm not going to do this again.

25
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
That sucks.

26
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,960
I love the kid that was dressed up like Hitler and you know what's

27
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Trevor is the best beat kid on that show. Thank you for returning Rob. I like the kid about pills though. He's my favorite. Pills! Pills! Pills! Pills! Pills! Pills!

28
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
Shut up

29
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,280
I think the power brick should be bigger than the PSP. It should be like a 360 or Xbox

30
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,820
He just slapped the back of the PSP. It should be a nuclear generator like the power packs in a

31
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:08,660
Ghostbusters power brakes made out of solid metal it's just gets super hot

32
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:19,860
cook eggs on it mmm eggs eggy hello hello is this thing on testing testing

33
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,340
one two I'm looking in the index but I don't see anything for how to run a

34
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,900
radio show hello I don't understand this this thing works

35
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,600
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

36
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,300
Is this on?

37
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,900
What the hell?

38
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,900
Orange Lounge Radio.

39
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,200
Broke-down ghetto bimani radio.

40
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,400
What the f***?

41
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,500
That's one of our old promos.

42
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,100
Kinda love that.

43
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,300
Oh, RetroOLR.

44
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,500
I missed the beep.

45
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,300
The beep was from, um...

46
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,500
R10K.

47
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,100
Alright, alright, just...

48
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,700
No, for reals.

49
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,400
We gotta get through this.

50
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,700
Or I swear to God, we'll be here all night.

51
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,300
Alright, here we go.

52
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,300
Tell it for yourself.

53
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,300
I thought that was QQQ.

54
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,000
Alright.

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,500
Shut up.

56
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,400
Everybody, shut up.

57
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,400
It's my turn.

58
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:04,040
Loki has this look at you're gonna fuck up you're gonna fuck up and then I fucked

00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,160

i'm turning around

66
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,680
why do we have you on this program anyway?

67
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,000
okay this is you talking blah blah blah blah blah

68
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,640

right at you, and I turn over to her and she's like,

70
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
and how am I not supposed to laugh at that?

71
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,640
For the sake of the chat room, I was leaning over my laptop,

72
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
staring at Rob intently.

73
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
I don't want to be a duck.

74
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

75
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,640
This is not a drunk show. Stop filming.

76
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,640
I'm going to turn around and not look at you people

77
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
so I can get through this segment.

78
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,640
So, Loki, be ready with a Tomb Raider story

79
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
and no more giggling.

80
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Okie dokie.

81
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Yeah, we have a Tomb Raider story.

82
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,800
okay

83
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,480
seriously Jesus alright know how Bobby black by himself

84
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm starting to wonder if that's not a bad idea

85
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,560
alright

86
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Here we go.

87
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,880
And we're back here with the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth. It's that portion of the show

88
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:09,440
that's too hot to podcast it's sticky it's it's perverted we have the cage

89
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,200
match coming up which is pretty much gonna be just about all we do tonight

90
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,920
because we're already at nine o'clock that was an awfully long show tonight

91
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,240
but oh well maybe if you would quit laughing so much that's true it's not

92
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,680
the show itself like when it's when it comes out on the stream it's don't stop

93
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,800
it when it comes out on the podcast stream it won't be very long there was

94
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,280
like yeah 20 minutes of giggle fits that's all right I recorded my fancy

95
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,060
video camera okay what is it so we're gonna do are we gonna do a video cast

96
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:40,980
then is that a little step no video we don't have to but this is mainly for

97
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:46,820
e3 because as we know we were talking about what we're doing our plans for e3

98
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,200
the special plans that no one's doing yeah that's mainly what's for so I can

99
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,900
walk through the entire booth and cover everything and that kind of stuff I love

100
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,720
that video camera. The other problem is the still pictures it takes aren't 100% good.

101
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:10,080
They're like 640x480, not really even a 1 megapixel. But when I figured I'm cropping

102
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:17,280
down most of the pictures anyways, I don't think it really matters. So, I don't know.

103
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,740
But it'll be pretty cool.

104
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,180
In random news, it's Bimani related, Sephiroth1215 sent me a private message in chat, hope you

105
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,260
don't mind me sharing that, but he sent me a link over to Konami's website here, and

106
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,740
Konami has a page here for DDR Supernova, and it says release date available now.

107
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,740
Lies.

108
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,260
I think there's a webmaster at Konami, it's about to get fired.

109
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,260
Hurray.

110
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,380
Why don't you email somebody about that?

111
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,600
Why would I email anybody about that?

112
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Can't you fix that?

113
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
You work for him?

114
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Can't you fire somebody?

115
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Do I care?

116
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Alright.

117
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,920
I sent you a link to my flash thingy and you never said anything.

118
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,600
When? I sent you an I.M. a few days ago.

119
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,000
That's because I work? That's because he's rude.

120
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,520
What? Can I leave my I.M. a phone network? I'm gonna pull it up and I'm gonna show you on my laptop.

121
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,160
Well you know you need to friend me now once you get a game.

122
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,080
Once I get a game. You don't even have to get a game. Buy some like of those

123
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,160
Xbox Live arcade games. I'll probably get Geometry Wars.

124
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,660
Didn't you download the ghost recon thing or something?

125
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,660
Hold on, I'm busy. Talk to me later.

126
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,660
I was going to do a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, but I don't think I really care about these people anymore.

127
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,660
So, let's get into tonight's cage match, shall we?

128
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
Okay, what were you talking about? Now I'm not busy.

129
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,660
Oh, I know it's too late.

130
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,660
I'm interested in it on my resume and I want you to have people hire me.

131
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,660
I do talk to marketing now.

132
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,160
I'm good friends with them since they give me feedback.

133
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,520
You work at Konami can't you you that means you're you control everything over there right does I move to the Bay Area

134
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,800
I do have a badge that gets me in every

135
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,320
Konami you and not many people do you and Hideo Kojima are tight right yeah?

136
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,040
We go out drinking and you know one together every day, right?

137
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
No

138
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
All right

139
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
We only went to 8.1.

140
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,620
song number one which won the cage match last week it was baby land yes yes baby

141
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,100
land who I'm going to see on April 15th in Berkeley all right baby land had this

142
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,620
song called Gary is that how you say Gary Gary Gary Gary all right well it

143
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,540
won last week's cage match with its funky indie sound I think I said it

144
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,420
sounded like the Postal Service on crack or something I don't remember but here

145
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,000
it is a lot of stuff is more industrial sounding with this I thought was very

146
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
All right, here it is. Have a good one. Song number one, Babyland. Enjoy.

147
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,500
We go on because we know there's nothing worth inquittin'

148
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:51,000
To bow down to the negatives

149
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We hold strong because we know there's something worth awaiting

150
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This is a part of me, I understand them

151
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I know I can't control the wonder of these clouds

152
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's building, it's building

153
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't tell me I'm wrong

154
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm living hard to be part of something new

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The straight lines and the stereotypes are gone

156
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
As nature continues to crawl

157
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:50,420
All right, song number two in tonight's cage match is coming up.

158
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,860
That once again was song number one, Babyland with Jerry.

159
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,780
And song number two is going to be a challenger.

160
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,760
And it's my pick, and it's a band called Goldfrap, actually I think Goldfrap is just the name

161
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,540
of the girl, but you know she's got a lot of people helping her out.

162
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:13,540
Goldfrap has this song from her new CD, Supernature is the CD, and the song is called Ooh La La,

163
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,940
and I like this song, it's kind of pornotastic, so it's my pick tonight, Ooh La La by Goldfrap,

164
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:25,940
enjoy or don't see if I care

165
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,940
Turn me up

166
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,940
Don't wanna roll the ledges

167
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,940
Click to the last

168
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,940
Switch me on

169
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,940
Turn me up

170
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,940
I want to touch you

171
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,940
You just made for love

172
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,940
I need la la la la la la la

173
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,940
I need to go la la la la

174
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,940
I'm feeling la la la la la la

175
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,940
I'm feeling la la la la

176
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:33,940
Cause of the harmony

177
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:40,940
I'm teasing and poaching

178
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,940
Switch me on

179
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,940
Turn me up

180
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,940
I'll try to feast, you just made for love

181
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,760
... phenalalalala...

182
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:19,760
Scree-la-la-la-la-la, Scree-oo-la-la-la-la

183
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:40,760
I'm gonna love some more, a little bit the same

184
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:47,760
I'm gonna heal up your heart, I'm gonna walk again

185
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
Yeah

186
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,760
Yeah

187
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Yeah

188
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:33,160
That was it, that was song number two there in the cage match, Ooh La La by Goldfrap.

189
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,200
I love that ending though.

190
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,800
You know what, that was part of a song I'm not supposed to be playing.

191
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Whoops!

192
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:50,080
Anyway, what did you guys think of Ooh La La by Goldfrap?

193
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Uh, Miklotov, she needs to quit smoking, one.

194
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,080
Loki, what did you think of Ooh La La by Gold Prep?

195
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,080
I recognized that, I don't know, it was okay.

196
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,080
It's good stripper music, I guess.

197
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,080
Um, it should be Gold Faf.

198
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,080
Um, I guess it'd be like 7'5".

199
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,080
Alright, um, Jamie, how would you rate the bathroom?

200
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
Or wherever you just were.

201
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,080
I could hear the music from the bathroom, thank you.

202
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,080
Alright, well, how would you like it?

203
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,080
No, I'm kidding.

204
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
It was...

205
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,360
I actually liked what I heard of it.

206
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,800
It was a little repetitive, but it gets an 8.

207
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,640
That is totally fucking music.

208
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
I give it a 9.

209
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,840
Oh shit, I forgot kids listen to this show.

210
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
My bad.

211
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,920
Alright, song number 3 tonight comes from Cheater Loki.

212
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,480
Cheater Cheater Cheater Loki.

213
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Hey, listen...

214
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,640
Do not support Cheater Loki tonight.

215
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Listen, I did the same thing when Kingdom Hearts 1 came out, okay, so obviously my choice was going to be Utada Hikaru with Passion, because that is the team song.

216
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,640
All right, here's song number three from Cheatin' Loki, Utada Hikaru with Passion. Enjoy.

217
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
Oh

218
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,640
I love you, don't you?

219
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,640
But surely if I don't

220
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,640
I'll carry on

221
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:48,640
I'm not afraid of you

222
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,640
I'm not afraid of you

223
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:08,640
All the years in my life, I'll forever sleep at home

224
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:19,960
Oh...

225
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,840
I wish that...

226
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:33,960
deserve

227
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:47,160
Alright, song number three tonight, Utada Hikaru with Passion.

228
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,960
Let's go around and see if everybody thought of that.

229
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Who started us off last time?

230
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Miku, talk.

231
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,160
It was long and had bad camera angles, it's a one.

232
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Loki.

233
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,640
I love that song.

234
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,440
I love the guitar.

235
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,440
That's the only thing I like remember of it each time, so...

236
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,440
Yet you used the version without the guitar bridge in the middle, like in the opening video.

237
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,440
You know what, I was pressed for time and I couldn't find the...

238
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Yeah, I had a feeling. I had a hunch.

239
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
Dark Sakura.

240
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
You didn't give a...

241
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

242
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
I gave it a 9.

243
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
Dark... Dark Sakura.

244
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,280
I really like this song although as far as I thought that

245
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,480
Hikaru was better as far as an opening song this

246
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:40,060
You know I really like this song it's a problem, but I just don't like things about it, so it gets a seven

247
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,880
I think the opening song to Kingdom Hearts 2 should have been easy breezy

248
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,120
Because I think that would have been much better come on you could have like Sora skipping down

249
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,620
It's not as dramatic.

250
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:58,620
Alright, no, I like that song a lot, but it's already in rotation, so I give it a five.

251
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,620
Alright, don't get me wrong, I love that song, but Loki sucks.

252
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,620
Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

253
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,620
Babyland with Jerry, song number one.

254
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:26,780
Alright and song number two you can vote for tonight is Goldfrapp with Ooh La La is the

255
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:36,500
name of that song.

256
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,340
Alright and song number three you can vote for tonight is from Loki and it's Utada Hikaru

257
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,340
with Passion.

258
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,860
Alright you already know what that song sounds like.

259
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,380
Alright place vote now.

260
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,380
Someone's bitter.

261
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,380
Send a private message.

262
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,380
It's already in rotation, that's cheating.

263
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,380
No one told me it was in rotation.

264
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,380
We told you two weeks ago.

265
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,380
Read the mod forum once in a while.

266
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,380
Send a private message.

267
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:06,420
We said it on the show and Rob said, here's some new songs that we just put into rotation

268
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,460
and i'm playing them during the break and that was the first song he played

269
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,920
i wasn't listening

270
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,220
dark sakura has a memory like an elephant i mean besides that's an

271
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,060
edit she don't forget she don't forget i yeah it's a slightly

272
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,580
different version i think i i think so you don't forget what

273
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,820
that that whole thing shut up yeah i think the one we have a

274
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,020
rotation does have the guitar riff i think it's the one from the movie so

275
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:40,980
it's the short one so all right and dude i'm gonna hit food maniac 64 with the trout now for being a

276
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,980
butt all right do so because he told told everyone not to vote for my song so that play his but i

277
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,220
haven't guaranteed that i'll play a song uh-huh yeah i told people i'd play their songs like

278
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,540
three months ago and i still haven't just just keep just keep dangling out there four times

279
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,540
Tell him to stop! Block him!

280
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,540
Ahh!

281
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,540
Alright.

282
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,540
Uh, since I need some time here to tabulate votes, I need filler.

283
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,540
So, we're gonna go around and do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

284
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,540
Dark Sakura, How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

285
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,540
Shitty! I mean, poopy.

286
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,540
No, my week was actually pretty good. I've got more stuff to do.

287
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:23,540
You know, my whole crappy work situation has improved to such a degree that I no longer feel like I'm going to kill people and then myself in a big emo fit.

288
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,840
Instead, I just feel like, you know, I'm going to mildly maim people and, you know, not like actually kill them, you know.

289
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,640
I'm no longer disgruntled. I'm slightly annoyed, but not disgruntled.

290
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:41,320
So, um, I've also been playing a lot of Ragnarok online. I have, as of today, my

291
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,960
primary character is 5441 and

292
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:52,400
I still have to get job 50 before I can go assassin and I donated some money to their server

293
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,400
So I got a bunch of free stuff for it, and I have a kitty band now and it makes me very happy bunny

294
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Yeah, I have a kitty band I

295
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,540
Need to see pictures. I will send you pictures, and I got a bunch of cards, too

296
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,600
I have a thief bug card and no like footwear that I can put it on

297
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,320
And now I need a zombie card

298
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,440
Because zombies are awesome like a hot dog

299
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,440
Um, Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

300
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,440
Um, my weekend day was okay. Um, gotta move my desk tomorrow, cause

301
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,440
we do this thing every once in a while, once we fire a bunch of people, where we do, like, the floor layout shuffle.

302
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
And we-

303
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
Those are fun.

304
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:46,440
Yeah, for no apparent reason. I mean, they'll even, they'll move people, like, one desk over, just for the hell of it.

305
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,120
it, and it's kind of fun. But anyway, so I got to move my desk, and I get my review next

306
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,920
week, which should be interesting because my phone time sucks, but I'm the smartest

307
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:02,840
one there. So, you know, it kind of evens out. And I don't know. It'll be cool. We're

308
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,920
supposed to be getting our bonuses. My coworker taught me this really cool thing with our

309
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,140
bonus because they take out twice the amount of taxes as they normally would on your checks

310
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:17,740
on bonus checks. So where I potentially could get $2,000, I only get like $1,100 or something.

311
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:28,260
So what you do is you put out another W4 or whatever for exempt for that week. So I get

312
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:36,020
my full $2,000, which is going to a laptop. And what else? Oh yeah, I got my spiffy camera,

313
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:41,120
which you'll hopefully see some more content for the PSP site. That's one of the main reasons

314
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,240
was for that, and that, so I can record some of my stuff at, you know, well I'm probably

315
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,480
going to record stuff at my bachelor party, because what happens at bachelor party stays

316
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,720
at bachelor party, and um, and also, um, do you know what they have planned for your bachelor

317
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:01,280
party yet? Because I do. I don't. Okay. Um, I do. But that's all I can say. Okay. Anyways,

318
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,360
um, the other thing is, um, just, you know, recording wedding stuff, um, just it's really

319
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,440
fun to play with that camera, because it has a 20 gig hard drive in there, so you can like

320
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,240
store tons of video. Lots of video coming from E3, that's for sure, so look

321
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,520
forward to that in lots of pictures. And yeah, I think that's about all I have.

322
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,400
Miguel Tov, how was your week?

323
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:32,000
My week was boring. Work is boring. I'm sick of it. And then today, slash last night, got

324
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,320
myself hyped up to go to Best Buy and wait in a non-existent line at 3 in the

325
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,880
morning. That didn't go over so well. Best Buy sucks. And then tomorrow, somebody

326
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,360
new that we hired is gonna be sitting in my office and I'm not looking forward to

327
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,700
that because I hate new people and I will not talk to them. You're not a team

328
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,220
player. I don't need to be a team player. They invaded my space. They can go away.

329
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,220
And, uh, I, um...

330
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,220
Oh! We started playing Tetris DS at work, and it's over already.

331
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,220
Because a lot of people suck and whine too much like me.

332
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,220
Back to apples and apples. Apples to apples is occasionally played. We recently discovered

333
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,220
the joy of Team Mario Kart at break.

334
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,220
That's really fun. Team Mario Kart? Yeah, and under versus, when you're setting up the options

335
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,220
like 150 and computer difficulty if you have computers and all that, there's an option for team.

336
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:32,100
and so you can actually do a four-on-four team and it's pretty much

337
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,840
like a regular race except you have a color icon like red or blue and you can

338
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,880
still attack your own teammates but how it works is it's an overall point total

339
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,400
for your team. You're no longer working just to be the best you're working as a

340
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,480
team so we started out last week when the losers were still playing Tetris me

341
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,140
and the person in my room or in my office we played it with computers and

342
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,060
he got screwed over twice with really bad computer players, but it's really fun, actually,

343
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:04,020
and I didn't even think Mario Kart could be more fun than it already was.

344
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,940
We're trying to find another game, because people are starting to get pissed off at my

345
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:13,740
work with Grand Theft Auto Liberty Sea Stories because they're calling me, they're saying

346
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,620
that I'm cheesing it up now because I used to just grab the mega damage icons or powerups

347
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,940
and then go kick the crap out of everyone.

348
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,940
So now we're playing without powerups because, you know, they got pissed off at that and

349
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,500
because I won the rankings this month. So this next month now we're just trying to

350
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,420
I want to do team games but the problem is we don't get enough people to

351
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:38,620
participate. You can only do six and some people are gone or busy and stuff and

352
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,380
that kind of makes it unfair but um I don't know we're looking forward to like

353
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,780
maybe Liberty City Stories when it comes out in PlayStation 2. Hopefully I'll have

354
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,980
multiplayer and then we you know land together some PS2s and play that way.

355
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,980
Okay. I don't know. It might be fun.

356
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,980
That could be fun.

357
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,980
Rob, how was your weekend today?

358
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,980
It was fine. Besides the whole male PMS thing, I was fine. I had a fine week.

359
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:09,980
I went to the gym today and my trainer pretty much told me officially today that I'm fat, which was good to hear.

360
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,980
I had to take the little machine that measures your body fat.

361
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,980
And you hold it in your hands away from your body?

362
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,980
Yeah, exactly. And it did the little boop, boop, boop thing.

363
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,980
VMI scale.

364
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:23,060
yep he looked at the number and then he turned it around said yep you're right

365
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,900
here in the high one like thanks but oh well I mean I already knew that was

366
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,660
coming anyway that's why you're going that's the whole reason I signed up for

367
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:35,060
the gym so I just you know have to make sure I stuff low regularly but I that's

368
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,380
pretty cool that you have a trainer though that'd be the only thing I'd

369
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,740
be able to do you know well I only get him one more time for free then I'd have

370
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,740
to pay for him if I like you both what come to my gym with me I'll work out

371
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,780
with you and show you what to do that would be fun that'd be fun well I mean

372
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,180
it's not that I don't know what to do, I just, you know, I need the motivation is a huge

373
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:58,820
thing. Put a cupcake in front of you. I promise you, next Monday, nothing will stand in between

374
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:04,780
us going to spin. Word. You know what, they do spin at this gym too. You have to go to

375
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,900
my trainer's spin. She's vicious. I asked my trainer if you could come to this club

376
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,920
and he said with a guest pass you can. So, you'll have to come to one of our classes

377
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,000
sometimes if you enjoy it. Alright, bring me a guest pass. You got it! You're on! And

378
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,200
we'll pick a class to do. We can do yoga. In the summer we can go swimming. We can do

379
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,560
yoga or something. Because don't they have a lap pool there? They have two huge pools

380
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,080
there. I got all the stuff to do lap swimming. Cool. They're outdoors though. I thought it

381
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,280
was indoors when I signed up. Oh, one of the ones I have a membership for over here has

382
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,240
a lap pool outside. It's the snooty one though. We need to do the indoor pool somewhere. I

383
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,880
Roseville. I'm going to Roseville, my parents live right there. I think Roseville has three indoor

384
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,920
pools. Anyway, oh hi, show! Shall we announce who won tonight's cage match?

385
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,680
That'll be a good way to get close to the end here. Sure, the winner song of

386
00:34:54,680 --> 00:35:02,660
tonight's cage match was... a tie! And here are the two songs. Okay, you know how ties

387
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:15,020
work. Here's song number one that tied. Baby Man. Here's song number two that tied. Passion,

388
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:20,620
Utada Hikaru, and in the old Orange Lounge Radio rule book. I wonder where this is going.

389
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:25,140
That means that when two songs tie, the host who got screwed over, oh that's me, gets to

390
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:31,780
break the tie. Now see, I could be ironic and vote for your pick, Loki. And then Jamie

391
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:37,940
could hate me all night that might be fun but no I can't do that because you

392
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,900
know you you totally picked a song that was already in rotation so I think you

393
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,640
both end up winning anyway so I am picking for Jamie's song I'm picking

394
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,500
Jamie's song baby land because I like the fact that they sound like social

395
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:59,340
service all right so two weeks in a row all right baby land for the win two

396
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,340
weeks in a row, not too shabby.

397
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,900
So everybody has to go to their show in Berkeley. Now the stripper song was only

398
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,340
one vote behind.

399
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:11,340
So it was close. We were all out there. We were all winners. It's a drop not as much of a winner's show.

400
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:17,660
So it was one vote for Pat, that one song, one vote for Jamie's song, and zero votes for yours.

401
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,480
Yeah, something like that.

402
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,940
And that was both of our listeners right there. Sweet. Alright, it's about

403
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,660
nine thirty and I think it's time to call it a night. What do you kids think?

404
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:32,380
I want ice cream. I'm thirsty. I want, I'm hungry. I want a cupcake.

405
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,840
I think there, no I think I ate the last one.

406
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,300
Bastard! No, it's fine. I need, uh, ooh, I want boba.

407
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,820
That's twenty-three maggots. I hear you there. Oh, you know, um,

408
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,660
Tap-X is open. You, stop it! Stop it, all of you!

409
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:53,140
No, no, John. I, Rob, I just got told by Fat today. I don't... Look at, look at you some

410
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:59,260
nice wheat grass. I don't want wheat grass. I want bulimia right about now. Alright.

411
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:09,140
Then fine I'll get you a bottle of Ipecac. Hooray. Ugh. Alright. And a toothbrush. That's

412
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:15,100
disgusting. You said you wanted bulimia. Alright, sorry chat room I ignored your FUs tonight,

413
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,820
maybe next week. Tonight was supposed to be a slow news night and we went on forever but

414
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,580
of course I think that little giggle fit had something to do with it. Your giggle fit,

415
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,080
OK, Rob.

416
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,900
My giggle fit?

417
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,660
You're a giggle fit.

418
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,340
Yeah, you're the only one laughing in the microphone.

419
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
We were laughing at you.

420
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,420
I have your giggle fit on camera, so.

421
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,220
All right, shut up.

422
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:29,740
A partial.

423
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,860
All right, here it is.

424
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,100
Your fortune cookie message.

425
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,500
I almost said your moment of zen.

426
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,300
You still want to be a duck?

427
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,020
Of the day, I don't want to be a duck.

428
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:48,020
We're tiny, we're toonie, we're all a little loony, and in this cartoony we're invading your TV.

429
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:54,020
We're comic dispensers, we crack up all of the censors, on Tiny Toon Adventures, get a dose of comedy.

430
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:58,020
So here's that big, cause it's a whole wide world apart.

431
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,020
Our hopes, we only stand alone, a cartoon worth a part.

432
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,020
The scripts were rejected, expect the unexpected.

433
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,020
Tiny Toon Adventures is about to start

434
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,020
They're furry, they're funny

435
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,020
They're fast and bust and bunny

436
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,020
Munch and a match has money

437
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,020
Amira is a pain

438
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,020
She's hunting and plucking

439
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,020
Dizzy, Devil, Yucky

440
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,020
Her ball's a monkey

441
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,020
And Go-Go isn't safe

442
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,020
At Atfield University

443
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,020
We earn our Toon degree

444
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:28,020
The teaching staff been getting laughs since 1933

445
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,020
We're tiny, we're tinny

446
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,020
We're all a little loony

447
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,520
It's fine, you tune in, just come and join the fun!

448
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,520
And now our song is done!
