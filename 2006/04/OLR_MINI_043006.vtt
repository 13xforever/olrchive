[SPEAKER_02]: We're taping on Saturday this week.

01:21.084 --> 01:24.528

[SPEAKER_02]: It's just us.

01:25.449 --> 01:25.889
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, darn.

[SPEAKER_02]: This is a mini episode.

01:30.674 --> 01:31.816
[SPEAKER_03]: I like episode-let.

01:32.515 --> 01:33.435
[SPEAKER_02]: A little episode let?

01:33.556 --> 01:34.196
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that name too.

01:34.216 --> 01:35.496
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call it an episode let.

01:35.997 --> 01:36.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:36.357 --> 01:36.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a nugget.

01:37.597 --> 01:38.778
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, a little episode let.

01:38.798 --> 01:39.858
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of gross.

01:40.679 --> 01:42.519
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nugget poop.

01:43.340 --> 01:46.681
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is our little episode let for this April 29, 2006.

01:47.221 --> 01:50.283
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be no Part B this week, so please don't be looking for it.

01:50.583 --> 01:52.143
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only going to do about half a show tonight.

01:52.464 --> 01:55.665
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been kind of a slow news week too, all things considered.

01:55.785 --> 01:56.785
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee you Wednesday.

01:57.086 --> 01:57.726
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Part B?

01:58.346 --> 02:01.487
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put up a picture of a face sticking out a tongue and go, there's your Part B.

02:22.614 --> 02:22.994
[SPEAKER_02]: Allgames.com 630-ish

02:44.918 --> 02:46.079
[SPEAKER_02]: I may find John Cena again this year in Stockholm.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.161
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know he was an E3 attendee.

03:04.182 --> 03:04.963
[SPEAKER_03]: He was there last year.

03:05.023 --> 03:06.285
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a wrestler.

03:06.305 --> 03:08.388
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to stalk celebrities, C-list celebrities?

03:08.649 --> 03:10.492
[SPEAKER_03]: I might bump into a few more celebrities.

03:10.572 --> 03:11.013
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

03:11.153 --> 03:15.480
[SPEAKER_03]: I bumped into Kojima the year before and I bumped into Miyamoto last year and this is literal.

03:15.714 --> 03:15.994
[SPEAKER_02]: E3 Outpost.com

03:45.799 --> 03:46.780
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't want to meet us?

04:15.649 --> 04:16.369
[SPEAKER_02]: or a dollar.

04:17.069 --> 04:21.051
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's cut the crap and get to how our gaming week was.

04:21.151 --> 04:22.491
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

04:23.271 --> 04:24.452
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye everybody!

04:25.992 --> 04:27.453
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I guess that's it for the show.

04:29.073 --> 04:31.054
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

04:31.114 --> 04:35.455
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a buttload of Ragnarok yesterday and I played a buttload of Ragnarok today.

04:35.875 --> 04:39.997
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of doing the rest of my homework today, I played a buttload of Ragnarok.

04:40.777 --> 04:41.777
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so responsible.

04:42.698 --> 04:43.978
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is that it was due two weeks ago.

04:46.444 --> 05:01.648
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I tried to play some Kingdom Hearts last weekend because I wasn't here last week because one of my really good friends and a listener of ours, DisneyPunk10, came up to hang out for my birthday week, which was drunken.

05:04.949 --> 05:05.549
[SPEAKER_03]: More drunken.

05:06.330 --> 05:06.870
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

05:06.930 --> 05:09.130
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about Dave and Buster's on last week's show.

05:09.150 --> 05:09.671
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good times.

05:10.611 --> 05:14.732
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually did not get as insanely drunk this year as I did the year before because now I'm grown up.

05:16.896 --> 05:19.499
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll never be a grown-up.

05:19.539 --> 05:20.500
[SPEAKER_02]: You still play games.

05:20.960 --> 05:21.841
[SPEAKER_02]: Games are for kids.

05:22.502 --> 05:22.963
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

05:25.505 --> 05:26.386
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, I'm joking.

05:26.867 --> 05:27.928
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't playing with my dolls.

05:30.111 --> 05:33.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, oh, you know, though, I found out a piece of... Oh, yeah, I saw Silent Hill three times.

05:35.063 --> 05:36.503
[SPEAKER_03]: I went on last Friday.

05:36.764 --> 05:38.064
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we didn't get to hear your feedback on the movie.

05:38.124 --> 05:38.904
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you liked it.

05:39.284 --> 05:39.604
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

05:40.505 --> 05:44.166
[SPEAKER_03]: I went Friday, and then I went again Sunday, and then I went Wednesday, and I drugged Julie with me.

05:44.486 --> 05:45.866
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible to see a movie too much?

05:46.066 --> 05:46.187
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

05:46.867 --> 06:01.671
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go again, hopefully, before we go to E3, and I think I'm going to see it while I'm at E3, because one of the DDR Freak moderators is from South America, and he hasn't... It's not opening there for a while, so we're going to probably bring him to see it at some point.

06:01.851 --> 06:02.252
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

06:03.052 --> 06:03.232
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

06:04.725 --> 06:07.306
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot.

06:07.746 --> 06:08.446
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, Silent Hill.

06:09.106 --> 06:10.307
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, Red Pyramid.

06:11.227 --> 06:12.487
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, you could kill me.

06:13.207 --> 06:13.828
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd die happy.

06:14.828 --> 06:18.809
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that they actually got an actual actor to play him in The Janitor.

06:19.309 --> 06:23.150
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he moves so fluidly.

06:23.770 --> 06:26.191
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, oh yeah, I could watch that for hours.

06:26.869 --> 06:33.190
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody at the, I was out at the club last night and some of us were talking about Silent Hill the movie and somebody called him Triangle Head.

06:33.490 --> 06:34.350
[SPEAKER_02]: That made me laugh.

06:34.370 --> 06:36.371
[SPEAKER_02]: Triangle Man.

06:36.431 --> 06:38.871
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly where my mind went to.

06:38.891 --> 06:43.512
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we know we're both dorks because my mind went exactly, Triangle Man, Triangle Man.

06:44.192 --> 06:46.933
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you catch that reference, you too, my friend, are a dork.

06:46.953 --> 06:52.794
[SPEAKER_03]: There actually is a LiveJournal icon where it had Pyramid Head as Triangle Man.

06:53.579 --> 06:58.343
[SPEAKER_03]: and what was the guy in the second game, James, as Person Man.

06:59.864 --> 07:01.746
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, games, gaming week.

07:01.766 --> 07:03.047
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.

07:03.607 --> 07:09.452
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit level 43 for my job class, which means I have seven more stupid job levels to go.

07:09.572 --> 07:11.113
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that you are a certified dork.

07:11.694 --> 07:17.038
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm not the one who was on... This is your gaming week, not my gaming week.

07:17.138 --> 07:17.438
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

07:19.060 --> 07:19.640
[SPEAKER_03]: Drama!

07:20.581 --> 07:20.741
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.923
[SPEAKER_02]: This is definitely an off night for us

07:24.302 --> 07:32.705
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, and then I, um, I, uh, worked on, uh, something I'm doing for Kingdom Hearts fan art opportunity with a friend.

07:33.605 --> 07:36.186
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, I've actually been sort of artsy gamey.

07:37.127 --> 07:42.608
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of trying to get back into my old, uh, you know, nerd hobbies, but school is sort of kicking my ass.

07:42.989 --> 07:45.049
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I'm doing a flashlight based off a video game.

07:45.089 --> 07:47.990
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not sure if I'm going to do Silent Hill like I've done all my other homework.

07:48.811 --> 07:50.311
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I might just do something.

07:50.331 --> 07:52.272
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a Guardian Legend tribute page in Flash?

07:52.292 --> 07:52.772
[SPEAKER_02]: That would rock.

07:53.411 --> 07:57.795
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

08:10.276 --> 08:11.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wants to do my flash homework for me?

08:11.836 --> 08:12.196
[SPEAKER_02]: Not me.

08:12.716 --> 08:15.877
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week, I played Final Fantasy XI a little bit.

08:16.817 --> 08:17.857
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, more than a little bit.

08:17.877 --> 08:19.338
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a lot.

08:20.478 --> 08:22.858
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI.

08:22.898 --> 08:24.498
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of like on a little mini break.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.259
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking a little mini vacation from it.

08:27.359 --> 08:34.800
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, the only really new game I played was Project Gotham Racing 3, which isn't really a new game because it was an Xbox 360 launch title.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.160
[SPEAKER_02]: But Loki let me borrow it.

08:36.540 --> 08:39.001
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's about like the 50th racing game I've played on the 360.

08:40.251 --> 08:41.191
[SPEAKER_03]: Download the Speed Pack.

08:41.511 --> 08:43.472
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to mention Dan downloaded the Speed Pack.

08:43.852 --> 08:44.652
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't that cost points?

08:45.593 --> 08:48.253
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, however, the cars that are in it are so worth it.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.994
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is the Evo 8MR.

08:50.774 --> 08:51.234
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

08:51.334 --> 08:51.654
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

08:51.975 --> 08:53.515
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I feel about this game still.

08:53.535 --> 08:54.995
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the game.

08:55.036 --> 08:55.776
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's pretty.

08:56.236 --> 09:00.837
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's got a great interface, and I think it's a very fluid interface, and it's great to get into.

09:01.237 --> 09:08.760
[SPEAKER_02]: But the racing itself, I found you have to use different tactics in this game than you do in other types of games like Ridge Racer, and that kind of threw me at first.

09:08.820 --> 09:09.740
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on your car, too.

09:10.520 --> 09:13.823
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand why it's not a game about drifting.

09:13.883 --> 09:16.065
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a street race type thing.

09:16.145 --> 09:17.326
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a different style.

09:17.915 --> 09:20.217
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to read up on GameFAQs how to do a frickin' turn right in that game.

09:20.237 --> 09:23.380
[SPEAKER_02]: My suggestion is actually to do the in-car view when you're playing.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.962
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually does make a difference.

09:42.746 --> 09:43.207
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

09:43.267 --> 09:46.889
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I get a little motion sick sometimes, too, because that view makes me all weird.

09:46.909 --> 09:48.310
[SPEAKER_03]: The interiors, though, are perfect.

09:48.670 --> 09:48.930
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

09:48.970 --> 09:49.550
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty looking.

09:49.570 --> 09:53.453
[SPEAKER_03]: I did notice a flaw, being that I'm a Lancer freak, since I drive a Lancer.

09:54.073 --> 09:58.996
[SPEAKER_03]: They did the interior for the Evo IX inside the Evo VIII MR. Wow, that's nerdy.

09:59.236 --> 09:59.796
[SPEAKER_03]: That is nerdy.

10:00.437 --> 10:03.759
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty awesome you know that, though, because I would never have noticed that.

10:03.779 --> 10:06.060
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that you can test drive all the cars, though, even the expensive ones.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.321
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a car person.

10:07.509 --> 10:10.310
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go to the expensive ones and do the test drive so you can see how they play.

10:11.190 --> 10:13.690
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun game and I will probably play more of it.

10:13.730 --> 10:16.231
[SPEAKER_02]: I just was a little like, whoa, this is a little bit different.

10:16.291 --> 10:19.211
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love that it's so fluid.

10:19.251 --> 10:20.952
[SPEAKER_02]: It is definitely one of the better racing games on 360.

10:22.092 --> 10:26.713
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of surprised because I didn't think it would be the type of game I'd like, but I really enjoyed it.

10:26.773 --> 10:35.455
[SPEAKER_02]: But for all these people that like to loop racing games in one big pile and call them all just like racing games, you know, like they're all the same.

10:36.075 --> 10:37.135
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to play this

10:37.987 --> 10:43.552
[SPEAKER_02]: Then play something with guns like Full Auto or Burnout, something where destruction is the main factor.

10:44.012 --> 10:49.957
[SPEAKER_02]: And then play something like, well I know Initial D is not on 360, but maybe something like Ridge Racer where it's more about drifting.

10:50.557 --> 10:53.580
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see the big differences between these racing games.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.803
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to loop the Project Gotham series in with the Gran Turismo series.

10:57.844 --> 10:59.205
[SPEAKER_03]: They play similarly.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.008
[SPEAKER_03]: More on the realistic side of car motion than...

11:03.550 --> 11:07.113
[SPEAKER_02]: I have yet to purchase that, I feel that I don't need it My brain is 50 million years old

11:29.096 --> 11:30.397
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a bad, you want to get it down.

11:30.737 --> 11:30.837
[SPEAKER_03]: One.

11:30.977 --> 11:32.717
[SPEAKER_02]: You want your brain age 20 is the lowest you can go.

11:33.338 --> 11:33.958
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 21 now.

11:34.278 --> 11:34.998
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 21 now.

11:35.318 --> 11:35.899
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on it.

11:37.279 --> 11:38.439
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some gaming news?

11:39.980 --> 11:41.641
[SPEAKER_02]: Big news in the gaming industry.

11:41.901 --> 11:45.102
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge, huge news in the gaming industry this week.

11:46.104 --> 11:46.704
[SPEAKER_02]: from Sony.

11:47.004 --> 11:56.048
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony has upgraded their PSP firmware to 2.70 to include Flash support.

11:57.088 --> 11:58.809
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I hear it sucks.

11:59.609 --> 12:02.370
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear the Flash support really stinks on this.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they say what Flash supports?

12:05.731 --> 12:06.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Flash 8?

12:07.512 --> 12:12.874
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they just say the release notes say now you can play Macromedia Flash content.

12:12.894 --> 12:13.494
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

12:13.855 --> 12:16.115
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not really supposed to save the content.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.776
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't play content that was saved.

12:18.056 --> 12:20.177
[SPEAKER_02]: Although supposedly people have found a way around that.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.758
[SPEAKER_02]: You access it from your browser.

12:21.998 --> 12:26.800
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's no way to launch just... Let's say you want to download Homestar Runner movies and watch them at your convenience.

12:27.040 --> 12:27.700
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really do that.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.021
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really work that way.

12:30.001 --> 12:31.622
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say that Flash games...

12:32.222 --> 12:36.004
[SPEAKER_02]: Run, like I was reading web forums, Flash games run like two frames a second, like they're horrible.

12:36.505 --> 12:40.307
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the Flash support is there, but needs a little bit of improvement.

12:40.507 --> 12:41.347
[SPEAKER_03]: I can work around that.

12:41.627 --> 12:42.128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll see.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows, we might be seeing our own content in Flash.

12:45.150 --> 12:48.231
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly, although I don't know, we may want to wait until this gets better.

12:48.451 --> 12:51.593
[SPEAKER_02]: Because from what I'm hearing, the feedback, not worth the upgrade.

12:51.873 --> 12:54.635
[SPEAKER_02]: The feedback I'm hearing on the forums is this is not worth the upgrade right now.

12:55.427 --> 12:56.267
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't mind testing it.

12:56.368 --> 12:58.589
[SPEAKER_03]: I really would not mind designing something and testing it out.

12:58.609 --> 13:00.650
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you still have my PSP, so I guess you could do that.

13:00.710 --> 13:01.090
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

13:01.230 --> 13:02.671
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be coming with us to E3.

13:02.791 --> 13:03.131
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

13:03.672 --> 13:04.132
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

13:04.152 --> 13:07.454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's plenty of reasons why everybody should bring their PSPs to E3.

13:07.794 --> 13:10.475
[SPEAKER_03]: My husband still has not got me my PSP.

13:11.176 --> 13:11.396
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

13:11.736 --> 13:13.017
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think we're getting a camcorder.

13:13.557 --> 13:15.418
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you need to get a PSP out of that, too.

13:16.677 --> 13:20.519
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else has been added in the PSP 2.7 upgrade.

13:21.240 --> 13:27.503
[SPEAKER_02]: UMD video L and R button has been added because you can disable the channel skip feature with the L and R buttons.

13:27.663 --> 13:29.304
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've done this before.

13:29.324 --> 13:31.825
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too easy to accidentally knock those buttons or hit them.

13:32.185 --> 13:33.606
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can disable that.

13:34.727 --> 13:41.330
[SPEAKER_02]: And AAC is now playable on the PSP as well, which is a very popular iTunes and Apple codec.

13:41.370 --> 13:42.311
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.

13:43.257 --> 13:47.441
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to check that out, all you have to do is just on your PSP you can update the firmware.

13:47.501 --> 13:57.310
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, for those of you guys that like to do controversial things on your PSP which involve downgrading your firmware, 2.7 will lock all that out because obviously they fixed all those loopholes.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.732
[SPEAKER_02]: So something to consider before you do this.

14:00.063 --> 14:02.645
[SPEAKER_03]: Where one loophole closes, another one opens

14:27.502 --> 14:55.085
[SPEAKER_02]: but I would say perhaps I think there's actually truth in this I think maybe they will keep quiet about the price I think they just want to show the goods and I think this whole blu-ray kind of factor will probably determine I mean because we still really don't know like is are the games going to be blu-ray I mean they say it is is it movies I mean are we still I mean certainly websites out there are talking about one way or the other but we still really don't know what Sony's plan really is for that

14:55.545 --> 14:58.649
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think until that's been established, it's really hard to get the price.

14:58.729 --> 14:59.570
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

15:00.411 --> 15:01.572
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I could be wrong.

15:01.793 --> 15:09.722
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like them to release the price, and I'm pretty sure it's going to be $399 to be competitive with Xbox 360, even though rumor is they're going to drop price.

15:10.183 --> 15:10.423
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

15:10.982 --> 15:12.743
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we'll know for sure until the end of summer.

15:12.783 --> 15:13.864
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems fair.

15:14.284 --> 15:18.787
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty much as much as the PS2 was released for when it came out.

15:19.028 --> 15:21.329
[SPEAKER_02]: And wasn't the PlayStation 1 about that much when it came out, too?

15:21.589 --> 15:22.070
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe at least $2.99.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.151
[SPEAKER_03]: No, yeah, it was around $2.99.

15:24.952 --> 15:30.315
[SPEAKER_03]: If I do remember correctly, because I didn't have one, I was there when someone bought one, because it lived in my dorm room.

15:31.236 --> 15:31.916
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't have a TV.

15:33.157 --> 15:37.200
[SPEAKER_02]: But, well, the price of a dollar has gone, you know, different directions since then, so...

15:38.277 --> 15:45.061
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, one other thing that we can expect on Sony is a very popular franchise's sequel, correct?

15:45.561 --> 15:46.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Luminous 2.

15:47.202 --> 15:47.542
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

15:47.682 --> 15:54.766
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like there was a mention into this video.

15:55.887 --> 16:01.650
[SPEAKER_03]: They were saying that it's probably going to be officially revealed at E3.

16:02.030 --> 16:05.672
[SPEAKER_03]: They made a mention of Luminous 2 is coming out, so maybe we'll see that at E3.

16:06.667 --> 16:06.887
[SPEAKER_02]: New music!

16:36.848 --> 16:42.333
[SPEAKER_02]: Special Art New Unlockable Content Free Porn It'll be Luminous with Sony characters

16:59.652 --> 17:04.816
[SPEAKER_02]: Other huge, huge, huge news in the gaming industry this week from Microsoft.

17:05.357 --> 17:09.320
[SPEAKER_02]: And Microsoft has said that they are going to be previewing E3.

17:09.340 --> 17:10.461
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, they haven't said this.

17:10.481 --> 17:11.261
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a rumor.

17:11.882 --> 17:18.247
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know Microsoft's going to show Halo 3 because they've got to derail the thunder from whatever Sony's going to bring, whatever Nintendo's going to bring.

17:18.427 --> 17:19.668
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got to derail the thunder.

17:19.728 --> 17:23.551
[SPEAKER_02]: So Halo 3, they are saying, is going to be previewed at the conference this

17:23.991 --> 17:25.733
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor has it it's a two minute video.

17:25.993 --> 17:27.214
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing playable yet, kids.

17:27.294 --> 17:27.594
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

17:27.974 --> 17:34.900
[SPEAKER_02]: But a video will still be enough to kind of get that, just get that cravens in for Halo.

17:34.920 --> 17:42.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure that you bring Kleenex to wipe the drool that the fanboys are going to be having over the game.

17:42.987 --> 17:43.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

17:44.188 --> 17:44.748
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out.

17:44.768 --> 17:46.209
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a good one at E3.

17:47.883 --> 17:51.966
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, another franchise with a sequel that could be shown at E3.

17:52.367 --> 17:53.607
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some pretty cool news.

17:53.908 --> 17:59.332
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like Red Octane and Harmonix are looking for indie musicians to put their stuff in Guitar Hero 2.

18:00.232 --> 18:12.541
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a contest at BeAGuitarHero.com so musicians can send in their own hard rock, heavy metal stuff that features a lead guitar as an mp3 format.

18:14.474 --> 18:16.215
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the Internet for them to review.

18:17.055 --> 18:25.319
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero 2 was announced actually this month, saying there'd be new play modes, new track list, 40 licensed, 15 unlockable, independent.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.360
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, Gibson's got support in this one again.

18:30.081 --> 18:34.323
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that the contest is really neat because we were introduced to a lot more.

18:35.123 --> 18:39.745
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say there's actually more bands local to, I guess, this whole area.

18:40.605 --> 18:43.947
[SPEAKER_03]: But it introduced people to a lot more bands.

18:44.674 --> 18:45.275
[SPEAKER_03]: The Hidden Track

19:04.281 --> 19:04.982
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

19:05.082 --> 19:06.943
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember reading something about that, that there's a hidden track.

19:06.963 --> 19:09.606
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually posted up on our website.

19:09.966 --> 19:14.750
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I just had a brain fart and forgot the name of it.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.452
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's Triple something.

19:18.173 --> 19:19.074
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another indie band.

19:19.114 --> 19:23.537
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a song that I recognized as a classic rock song.

19:23.617 --> 19:25.839
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds more like progressive rock.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.401
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was put up on Kotaku.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.442
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a video there.

19:30.923 --> 19:32.125
[SPEAKER_03]: The song is called...

19:35.325 --> 19:35.825
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, poo.

19:36.026 --> 19:37.666
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it's not something you can access, though.

19:37.967 --> 19:39.067
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to use code.

19:39.147 --> 19:41.489
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not like up, up, down, down, left, right code.

19:41.509 --> 19:43.010
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to use like a... Triplet.

19:43.330 --> 19:43.610
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

19:43.730 --> 19:44.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Triplet's the name of the song.

19:45.051 --> 19:45.151
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

19:45.171 --> 19:48.012
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to use a... What's a code thing on PlayStation called?

19:48.493 --> 19:50.374
[SPEAKER_02]: CodeShark, GameShark, CodeBreaker, whatever.

19:50.414 --> 19:50.874
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those things.

19:51.014 --> 19:52.015
[SPEAKER_03]: Pro Action Replay.

19:52.235 --> 19:52.515
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

19:52.695 --> 19:57.178
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did... Even though the video is not the greatest, this song is freaking hard.

19:57.918 --> 20:01.920
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way I'd ever be able to play that one, but it's an expert level song.

20:02.020 --> 20:02.881
[SPEAKER_02]: Why'd they take it out, I wonder?

20:03.769 --> 20:04.410
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero Guitar Hero

20:21.088 --> 20:21.668
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

20:44.642 --> 20:51.849
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to more news about the PSP, LocoRoco has a demo that's downloadable in Japan.

20:52.430 --> 20:57.094
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can check that out at www.jp.playstation.com.

20:57.875 --> 20:59.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you actually have to navigate a little ways to get there.

21:00.277 --> 21:00.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

21:18.595 --> 21:19.015
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

21:48.340 --> 21:58.879
[SPEAKER_03]: and then their first DS game Panzer Tactics DS which is World War 2 again turn-based strategy Pacific Storm which is sort of turn-based and real-time

22:00.600 --> 22:02.221
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, it's more World War II.

22:02.261 --> 22:05.182
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like they're sort of stuck in the 1940s there for a bit.

22:06.223 --> 22:09.404
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there will be Heroes of Annihilated Empires.

22:10.665 --> 22:15.066
[SPEAKER_03]: The open beta has actually just launched for that one.

22:15.227 --> 22:22.069
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dark Star 1, which is a sci-fi action game about a pilot trying to solve a mystery.

22:23.150 --> 22:23.330
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.

22:24.045 --> 22:24.645
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds pretty cool.

22:24.945 --> 22:27.226
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'll definitely look up, you know, anything.

22:27.627 --> 22:31.929
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I personally am not into the strategy games, but I love anything historical.

22:32.469 --> 22:34.290
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always go buy some of those.

22:34.590 --> 22:39.152
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if I don't care about the game itself, I go to look and see how accurate are they.

22:39.212 --> 22:40.052
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, look at the demos.

22:40.072 --> 22:40.873
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's pretty cool.

22:41.573 --> 22:41.773
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

22:42.233 --> 22:43.554
[SPEAKER_03]: I like games that teach you something.

22:44.454 --> 22:48.196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it kind of reminds me of, you really got a kick out of that story a while back.

22:48.216 --> 22:50.317
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the MMO that had the crucified guy?

22:50.357 --> 22:52.418
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Roman Empire one.

22:52.438 --> 22:52.838
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:54.278 --> 22:54.958
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?

22:55.659 --> 22:59.321
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a Marvel Action RPG that makes me happy!

22:59.661 --> 22:59.962
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

23:01.002 --> 23:07.706
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually says it's going to have more than the standard X-Men franchise that we typically see as of late.

23:08.407 --> 23:11.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Activision and Raven are going to put this out on damn near everything.

23:12.409 --> 23:15.251
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm sure if you've got the system, it'll play it.

23:15.691 --> 23:17.573
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, short of like the PC Engine or something.

23:17.593 --> 23:18.173
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

23:18.965 --> 23:21.868
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be called Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

23:22.628 --> 23:28.073
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be out actually on the next gen and current gen ones, including the handheld PC.

23:28.714 --> 23:35.260
[SPEAKER_03]: More than 20 playable Marvel characters with Spider-Man, Wolverine, Blade, Captain America, supposed to be out in the fall.

23:37.324 --> 23:44.687
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's supposed to be the usual, you know, not just the fate of the Earth, but the entire Marvel Universe thing.

23:44.747 --> 23:45.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Choose your own adventure.

23:46.587 --> 23:49.529
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, I pushed the red button, the world explodes type of thing.

23:50.809 --> 23:52.310
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a new combat system.

23:52.350 --> 23:54.390
[SPEAKER_03]: You have air combat ground underwater.

23:54.991 --> 23:59.152
[SPEAKER_03]: You have power charging melee weapons.

23:59.732 --> 24:00.253
[SPEAKER_03]: You have...

24:01.753 --> 24:07.417
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only are you going to be able to choose your characters, you actually will make your team of different Marvel characters.

24:07.557 --> 24:10.279
[SPEAKER_03]: You will have different things to represent them.

24:10.299 --> 24:13.001
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be really customizable.

24:13.101 --> 24:18.765
[SPEAKER_03]: It's as far as your actions actually determine how the game goes.

24:20.086 --> 24:22.788
[SPEAKER_03]: I think sort of fable in that respect.

24:24.109 --> 24:28.372
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I have the release dates for this month.

24:30.034 --> 24:30.374
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually...

24:31.189 --> 24:31.550
[SPEAKER_03]: Gugu Gugu Nugget

24:48.433 --> 25:02.963
[SPEAKER_03]: me and my Katamari on the 5th coming out on PSP Metroid Prime Hunters on the DS, Samco Museum 50th Anniversary on the GameCube Pac-Man World 3 on the various collection of random systems Rainbow Islands Revolution I thought that would make you happy

25:04.801 --> 25:12.007
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm from the DS Well, no, because I thought that you liked Bubble Bobble Rainbow Islands It's just like that, for real?

25:12.188 --> 25:32.025
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is Oh my gosh, okay, now I am excited Well, it's just because I knew that you were a big Bubble Bobble fan Yeah, I didn't realize it would be the same thing, that's cool Yeah, I'm actually just pulling this up on Eurogamer And it is Bubble Bobble Rainbow Islands Very cool Yeah, see, I love Rainbow Islands, that was a great game

25:33.398 --> 25:46.788
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Rogue Galaxy on the PS2 and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter Coming out They actually get Brain Age on the 19th It's fun Check out last week's show if you want my review

25:48.258 --> 25:54.643
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming back stateside, not a whole lot shaking up the industry this week as far as release dates go.

25:55.343 --> 25:58.426
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably because of the upcoming E3, there's not a very big calendar.

25:59.046 --> 26:00.167
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably until we get into June.

26:00.487 --> 26:02.589
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there are a couple games to look out for.

26:02.669 --> 26:06.352
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2 has Gallop Racer 2006 on May 2nd.

26:08.553 --> 26:11.576
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360 doesn't really have anything coming until the end of this month.

26:11.836 --> 26:16.300
[SPEAKER_02]: The next big release scheduled is Rockstar Games Table Tennis on May 22nd.

26:17.304 --> 26:19.045
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Boy Advance, Dr. Sudoku, if you really want it, May 1st.

26:38.752 --> 26:44.334
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean you're going to have the really hard part where you have to, you know, feel your... It is for real Top Gun based on the old movie.

26:44.715 --> 26:45.455
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can believe it.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.896
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'm thinking of the old Top Gun Nintendo game.

26:48.656 --> 26:50.237
[SPEAKER_03]: That game pissed me off so much.

26:50.577 --> 26:51.598
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I could never land.

26:51.618 --> 26:52.078
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd crash.

26:52.298 --> 26:54.399
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder how similar it is to the old NES one.

26:54.659 --> 26:55.479
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to check that out.

26:55.519 --> 26:59.741
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen really the only... We need more games, I think, that played like that.

26:59.801 --> 27:00.641
[SPEAKER_03]: Like After Burner.

27:00.681 --> 27:01.662
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a new After Burner.

27:03.042 --> 27:05.043
[SPEAKER_03]: Except I think I'm going to get the Stegages.

27:05.143 --> 27:06.424
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you got a new Outrun, so you never know.

27:07.020 --> 27:08.301
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we did pick up Outrun 2006.

27:08.461 --> 27:09.381
[SPEAKER_03]: How was it?

27:09.941 --> 27:11.242
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually is pretty cool.

27:12.363 --> 27:16.925
[SPEAKER_03]: I was making pizza the other day, and Dan's like, my girlfriend keeps getting pissed off at me.

27:16.945 --> 27:21.687
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yeah, and your wife's going to get pissed off at you if you keep screaming about it.

27:23.708 --> 27:24.408
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was pretty cool.

27:24.428 --> 27:31.072
[SPEAKER_03]: He showed me the little demo mode, and it played with a remix of Magical Sound Shower, which made me all happy because that's my favorite Outrun song.

27:34.785 --> 27:39.147
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to a follow-up story, but this is a follow-up of something like months old.

27:39.167 --> 27:42.427
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we talked about this, and I don't even know if we talked about it on a podcast.

27:42.447 --> 27:43.688
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have been on one of our live shows.

27:43.888 --> 27:46.949
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't call it a following-up as much as a, oh, we caught up to it.

27:47.349 --> 27:47.829
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda.

27:48.169 --> 27:54.331
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is the thing, is that there was an article in the Mercury, I believe it was the San Jose Mercury News that published this.

27:55.411 --> 27:56.251
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the...

27:58.212 --> 27:58.272
[SPEAKER_02]: E.A.

27:58.292 --> 27:58.873
[SPEAKER_02]: Spouse Erin Hoffman

28:16.685 --> 28:38.026
[SPEAKER_02]: and her husband was Leander Hasty and he was working on Battle for Middle Earth for Electronic Arts and she's the one that posted the story and he is not working at EA anymore obviously, he's a game designer over at Playable Productions and kind of interesting, I guess what happened is that he was part of this class action lawsuit about the unpaid overtime against EA, so...

28:39.183 --> 28:41.725
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they took their story public, finally, so, very interesting.

28:41.945 --> 28:48.430
[SPEAKER_03]: While the legal proceedings are going on, they actually advise not to go public with identity or any type of information because it could hurt the case.

28:49.330 --> 28:54.574
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure, I have to be honest, I can't remember if it was settled already or not.

28:55.474 --> 29:05.181
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at the time that we read the article, they were actually in the... Right, right, right, no, definitely at the time the article first came out, it wasn't, so...

29:07.067 --> 29:08.728
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to read over it real quick here.

29:08.748 --> 29:28.158
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know from having friends who have sued the facilities that they work for, they're advised not to have any contact with, that is if they've left the company, not to have any contact with anybody who still works there and not to really reveal the details going on until after it's been settled.

29:29.999 --> 29:32.340
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would think that that's been why it's so long getting that name out.

29:34.441 --> 29:35.662
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you have it, a little follow-up.

29:36.428 --> 29:36.648
[SPEAKER_02]: Grr, argh

30:08.044 --> 30:12.374
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wouldn't say this is so much of an FU as it was an almost FU.

30:12.394 --> 30:15.602
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this was really the only thing that's got me at all frustrated this week.

30:16.103 --> 30:17.165
[SPEAKER_03]: Is on my way here...

30:18.377 --> 30:25.001
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm driving along in my lane and some guy in a truck decides that he wants to be in my lane and that he'll conveniently not see me.

30:25.101 --> 30:28.883
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's pulling into my lane and I'm beeping like, you, move on!

30:29.143 --> 30:29.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay out of my lane!

30:29.924 --> 30:30.644
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm driving here!

30:31.404 --> 30:45.392
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he ends up... I slow way down, you know, but I can't really brake because there's this car right behind me so I'm slowing way down to try to get behind this guy and he ends up just swinging on in and smacking the front side of my car.

30:46.193 --> 30:46.333
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

30:47.432 --> 30:55.713
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually had started to steer away at that point, you know, so I was all, you know, he knocked my window in, my rearview mirror just pulled inside, rolled down my window, popped it back out.

30:56.534 --> 31:04.335
[SPEAKER_03]: And he eventually, like, you know, hours later, pulls over, you know, and I was like, dude, you are giving me your registration right now.

31:04.975 --> 31:07.095
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gets this look on his face like, oh, shit.

31:07.876 --> 31:14.057
[SPEAKER_03]: So, because, you know, anyone who messes with my car gets the wrath of Sakura brought down upon them.

31:15.477 --> 31:16.177
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my car.

31:18.104 --> 31:34.160
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my car a whole lot so I'm looking at the side of the car and there's oil all over the side and I'm like oh god oh god oh god so I took out my little hand wipes and start wiping the oil off to see what the damage looks like there's no damage my car is fine

31:35.197 --> 31:36.078
[SPEAKER_03]: I go look at his car.

31:36.378 --> 31:37.219
[SPEAKER_03]: His truck is fine.

31:37.239 --> 31:39.801
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, dude, you are so lucky your car's filthy.

31:40.361 --> 31:41.102
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, what?

31:41.122 --> 31:43.083
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, put your registration back in your car.

31:43.123 --> 31:43.604
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need it.

31:43.804 --> 31:44.585
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't hurt my car.

31:44.625 --> 31:46.286
[SPEAKER_03]: Your car's so greasy, my car slid right off it.

31:47.367 --> 31:52.271
[SPEAKER_03]: And I showed him, and he's like, whoa, your car doesn't look like it's damaged at all.

31:52.291 --> 31:53.332
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, it's not.

31:53.352 --> 31:57.495
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I didn't really care if, you know, maybe reverse damage had been done.

31:57.515 --> 31:58.796
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, don't worry about it.

31:58.816 --> 31:59.296
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go on.

31:59.316 --> 31:59.917
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, okay.

32:01.218 --> 32:01.298
[SPEAKER_03]: F.U.

32:01.318 --> 32:02.499
[SPEAKER_03]: to A Lack of Sleep

32:31.016 --> 32:32.116
[SPEAKER_03]: I can step on your foot for you.

32:32.176 --> 32:32.776
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thank you.

32:33.457 --> 32:33.877
[SPEAKER_02]: F you, Jamie.

32:35.017 --> 32:35.777
[SPEAKER_02]: F you right back, Rob.

32:37.258 --> 32:40.598
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been getting a lot of sleep this week, so F you to that.

32:41.358 --> 32:42.019
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.

32:42.399 --> 32:43.059
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a good one.

32:43.699 --> 32:46.120
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the fact that I am traveling to L.A.

32:46.240 --> 32:53.481
[SPEAKER_02]: next week for my day job, so I'm flying down there and coming back Friday, and then I drive back down on Monday for E3.

32:54.302 --> 32:55.322
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have a caravan, though.

32:55.642 --> 32:57.542
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I still don't have my confirmation for, either.

32:57.602 --> 32:59.123
[SPEAKER_02]: My emails are being ignored at this point.

32:59.663 --> 33:00.423
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that interesting?

33:01.451 --> 33:02.952
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like you should follow my advice.

33:02.972 --> 33:05.974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's see.

33:06.014 --> 33:08.395
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll have to be reporting from the front door because they won't let me in.

33:08.996 --> 33:09.336
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

33:10.717 --> 33:14.379
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you're in and Matt's in, but me, no love for Rob.

33:15.880 --> 33:16.400
[SPEAKER_02]: I see how it is.

33:16.580 --> 33:17.441
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give you a taser.

33:18.015 --> 33:25.381
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll just have to hack things like my DS because apparently you can hack your DS like you can make it look like a DS Lite.

33:25.821 --> 33:32.687
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can't obviously make the shell of it look like a DS Lite, but you can make the screen a lot brighter like a DS Lite.

33:32.987 --> 33:34.268
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some hacks.

33:34.568 --> 33:38.632
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hacked firmware that you can put out there and get on there.

33:38.812 --> 33:46.518
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually was a story that originally broke over on the forums over at gbadev.com.

33:48.039 --> 33:52.483
[SPEAKER_02]: So it actually came originally from a Spanish board is where this came from.

33:52.583 --> 33:53.904
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of interesting.

33:53.924 --> 33:56.567
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's pictures that prove it that show that it got brighter.

33:56.647 --> 33:59.189
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're interested in that, check that out.

33:59.469 --> 34:02.272
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when the Afterburner came out on the GBA.

34:03.953 --> 34:06.615
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have a GBA with an Afterburner.

34:06.815 --> 34:10.439
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the Afterburner in my GBA except I loaned my GBA out to a friend who was gameless.

34:11.019 --> 34:12.200
[SPEAKER_03]: My GBA is pink.

34:13.101 --> 34:14.382
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine is virginal white.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.661
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually own a pink video game system.

34:17.841 --> 34:20.323
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my one requisite girly thing.

34:20.343 --> 34:20.803
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

34:21.283 --> 34:22.524
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, just a quick follow-up.

34:22.564 --> 34:25.466
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're writing emails right now, you can cut that out.

34:25.486 --> 34:28.267
[SPEAKER_02]: I did find the quick follow-up there to the EA spouse story.

34:29.188 --> 34:33.190
[SPEAKER_02]: There were indeed, those lawsuits were indeed already settled.

34:33.230 --> 34:38.353
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually three class action lawsuits and it was already, or they actually weren't settled.

34:39.834 --> 34:44.196
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they won settlements in three class action lawsuits the developers did.

34:44.477 --> 34:44.957
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is.

34:45.979 --> 34:47.141
[SPEAKER_03]: I love when the little man wins.

34:50.845 --> 34:51.165
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

34:52.567 --> 34:58.975
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura is not going to be reading any mail but she does have a few words of advice for those of you guys that want to send in mail for next week's show.

35:00.275 --> 35:01.797
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, send more of it.

35:03.358 --> 35:07.402
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand I've got three weeks worth of email that's come through.

35:08.563 --> 35:14.427
[SPEAKER_03]: I've replied to as many of them as I could within the limited scope of my homework beating me over the head with a sledgehammer.

35:15.649 --> 35:16.890
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to start fresh.

35:16.930 --> 35:20.873
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise I will read emails regularly.

35:21.601 --> 35:21.901
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

35:47.723 --> 35:51.268
[SPEAKER_02]: We really want to hear your opinions and your thoughts on things.

35:51.288 --> 35:52.289
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're really after.

35:52.549 --> 36:00.098
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, make sure that if you have an email address that any way remotely resembles anything spam,

36:01.207 --> 36:06.829
[SPEAKER_03]: When you send us an email in the subject line, make sure you put OLR and then your subject.

36:07.430 --> 36:14.993
[SPEAKER_03]: That way, even if it comes into the spam folder, I at least see that we have OLR in the title and I can check it.

36:17.134 --> 36:20.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that has a spam thing on it, I instantly delete it.

36:20.175 --> 36:20.595
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

36:21.876 --> 36:25.357
[SPEAKER_03]: I check the email for us at various locations.

36:25.957 --> 36:29.999
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not want to run the risk of infecting systems that are not my property.

36:30.635 --> 36:32.297
[SPEAKER_03]: If I infect my own system, I can fix it.

36:32.317 --> 36:33.398
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you should be doing work at work.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.161
[SPEAKER_03]: I never said I was at work.

36:36.261 --> 36:37.362
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just teasing you.

36:37.783 --> 36:39.445
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a good girl and I do my job.

36:41.227 --> 36:42.928
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, guess what?

36:45.431 --> 36:48.054
[SPEAKER_02]: Koei has revealed their E3 lineup.

36:48.662 --> 36:53.384
[SPEAKER_02]: and in that lineup, Guitar Man Live is coming to the PSP in America.

36:53.444 --> 36:54.825
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be shown at E3.

36:54.885 --> 36:55.725
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Koei.

36:56.486 --> 36:58.347
[SPEAKER_02]: Exciting news indeed, don't you think?

36:58.707 --> 36:59.407
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Koei.

36:59.707 --> 37:00.768
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I love them too.

37:00.788 --> 37:06.551
[SPEAKER_03]: Koei is another one of my favorite companies that not many people think of.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.031
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very happy to hear that.

37:08.191 --> 37:10.553
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they'll just bring us another KO Flying Squadron.

37:10.753 --> 37:11.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I'll be happy.

37:11.753 --> 37:13.694
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm trying to remember the other stuff they have coming to E3.

37:13.714 --> 37:16.575
[SPEAKER_02]: They also announced some other things that are supposed to be coming to E3.

37:16.675 --> 37:17.536
[SPEAKER_03]: Dynasty Warriors.

37:19.232 --> 37:20.674
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're doing Dynasty Warriors.

37:20.874 --> 37:21.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

37:22.315 --> 37:29.764
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well then let's go over now to DarkSakura to talk about how she likes to surf the internet, you know, sometimes when she's at work.

37:29.804 --> 37:30.545
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at work.

37:30.785 --> 37:32.327
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes when she's at friends' houses.

37:32.827 --> 37:37.032
[SPEAKER_02]: And she finds great websites to share with you guys in her website of the week.

37:39.134 --> 37:40.776
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually didn't find this one on my own.

37:41.755 --> 37:51.822
[SPEAKER_03]: This one was given to us in the middle of my Flash class, and I figured Flash pisses me off so much, I'm sure we have many other listeners who are just as pissed off by Flash as I am.

37:52.362 --> 37:54.984
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not, by the way, piss me off as much as Illustrator does.

37:55.664 --> 37:58.726
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this site is called Actionscript.org.

37:59.447 --> 38:05.651
[SPEAKER_03]: For anyone who has to deal with a lot of in-depth Flash stuff, by now you are familiar with how frustrating working with scripts can be.

38:06.592 --> 38:08.293
[SPEAKER_03]: Programming in your Stop Here program

38:08.732 --> 38:11.294
[SPEAKER_03]: Play, and then stop on frame, kiss my butt.

38:11.434 --> 38:14.537
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is the perfect site.

38:14.617 --> 38:26.987
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only does it have tutorials on how to set up a lot of your different flash actions, also outlined from beginning to advanced level, it has your actual scripts that you need to make all this stuff work, and working examples.

38:27.908 --> 38:31.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these are also listed with movie files to go along with them to show you how to do it.

38:31.912 --> 38:32.112
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

38:33.076 --> 38:33.577
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool site.

38:33.597 --> 38:39.761
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only that, it's also available in, I believe, Japanese, Dutch, French, Russian, and Serbian.

38:42.322 --> 38:44.644
[SPEAKER_02]: For anybody that needs those Serbian tools.

38:44.684 --> 38:47.165
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sometimes you need to read your sites in Serbian.

38:47.806 --> 38:48.126
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

38:48.206 --> 38:49.767
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be from that area of the world.

38:49.807 --> 38:50.227
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

38:51.128 --> 38:53.229
[SPEAKER_02]: You provide a world-class service to our listeners.

38:53.269 --> 38:53.870
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

38:53.990 --> 38:54.530
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I do.

38:58.067 --> 39:01.388
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, we got one last story for you guys tonight.

39:01.428 --> 39:02.848
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you have any last minute stories.

39:02.888 --> 39:03.449
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything.

39:03.469 --> 39:04.169
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any last minute stories?

39:04.189 --> 39:06.389
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing video game related, but this is just nerd happy.

39:06.609 --> 39:07.009
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what?

39:07.470 --> 39:12.671
[SPEAKER_03]: I found out that the movie theater at Arden Fair Mall is playing Spaceballs next week.

39:12.771 --> 39:14.772
[SPEAKER_02]: They do cult movies every Thursday.

39:14.812 --> 39:16.212
[SPEAKER_03]: They're playing Spaceballs.

39:16.912 --> 39:18.113
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Spaceballs the game.

39:18.193 --> 39:21.173
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to go to that, except I'm going to be out of town, which makes me sad.

39:21.513 --> 39:23.954
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to Fandango my tickets.

39:24.794 --> 39:27.015
[SPEAKER_03]: I will dance the Fandango with my credit card.

39:27.560 --> 39:28.201
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39:41.812 --> 39:42.713
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Indiana Jones.

40:06.651 --> 40:12.316
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sense because there's supposedly an Indiana Jones movie new one coming on the way too.

40:12.496 --> 40:14.398
[SPEAKER_03]: Harrison Ford is too old for this stuff.

40:14.458 --> 40:17.560
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but Sean Connery is rumored to be reprising his role, which might be cool.

40:17.580 --> 40:18.902
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Sean Connery.

40:19.042 --> 40:20.083
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, who doesn't love Sean Connery?

40:20.103 --> 40:23.425
[SPEAKER_03]: He could be a quadruple amputee and he would still be hot.

40:23.445 --> 40:23.946
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

40:25.527 --> 40:28.370
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that's about all the stories this week.

40:28.750 --> 40:30.051
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can't think of anything else.

40:30.111 --> 40:32.673
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really think of anything else either, so I guess that's it.

40:32.993 --> 40:33.594
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done with the show.

40:34.034 --> 40:34.555
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um...

40:35.293 --> 40:35.994
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:58.311 --> 40:59.992
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's going to do it for another week of Orange Sounds Radio.

41:00.012 --> 41:05.134
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Radio even on weeks when we're not fully staffed.

41:05.555 --> 41:06.395
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate it.

41:06.815 --> 41:07.896
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you guys.

41:08.016 --> 41:10.677
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget to check out our big preview show next week for E3.

41:11.438 --> 41:15.460
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't forget to come by the E3 outpost and check that out as well.

41:15.700 --> 41:17.321
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, chocolate and a dollar.

41:18.261 --> 41:18.901
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important.

41:19.442 --> 41:21.983
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, I forgot.

41:22.763 --> 41:25.145
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo renamed their revolution to the Wii.

41:25.665 --> 41:26.765
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Wii!

41:27.226 --> 41:27.746
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next week!

41:30.652 --> 41:33.213
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

41:33.413 --> 41:36.234
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

41:36.774 --> 41:46.137
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information on our live and podcast programs, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next week!

41:52.499 --> 41:55.660
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, kill the music, kill the music, kill the music.

41:55.961 --> 41:57.141
[SPEAKER_03]: Whee!

41:58.781 --> 41:59.442
[SPEAKER_03]: Whee!

41:59.462 --> 42:00.042
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, look.

42:01.670 --> 42:02.250
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

42:22.697 --> 42:23.318
[SPEAKER_02]: Avoid the emo part.

42:23.338 --> 42:23.778
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have...

42:48.544 --> 42:49.064
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Gaming Community,

43:14.364 --> 43:27.715
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have called it the Nintendo Poopmonger, and as long as there's a sexy Zelda game on it, or an innovative Mario title, or some kawaii Animal Crossing game, or hopefully a new innovative franchise, y'all will be anxious to play it.

43:28.216 --> 43:32.980
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, Nintendo is not after your business so much this time, and while yes, I agree,

43:33.280 --> 43:34.822
[SPEAKER_02]: They need it to be successful.

43:35.322 --> 43:40.767
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the fact stated above that you'll play a good game regardless of the name of the system it's on.

43:41.088 --> 43:49.255
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole Wii thing is highly symbolic of the push Nintendo is trying to make to break the gamer stereotypes and get this thing playable by anyone.

43:49.696 --> 43:53.980
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weird name, but honestly, you had to expect something like this from Nintendo, hmm?

43:54.360 --> 43:56.022
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wait and see how good the games are.

43:56.582 --> 43:56.963
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

43:58.043 --> 44:01.704
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can say Wii is stupid because come play with my Wii Wii, haha.

44:02.024 --> 44:05.185
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just as easy to make fun of a sex box or a gay station.

44:05.745 --> 44:07.526
[SPEAKER_02]: Potty brains can ruin anything.

44:07.846 --> 44:08.746
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, I know.

44:09.827 --> 44:10.367
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

44:10.407 --> 44:17.449
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first saw it, though, if there hadn't been a pronunciation guide with it, I was thinking, well, maybe they... Why?

44:17.629 --> 44:24.771
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking, well, I was thinking why because that actually would make sense in my head because why is like yay in Japanese.

44:25.678 --> 44:33.123
[SPEAKER_03]: WAI, I thought that if they were going to spell it, it would be Y, but we... I'd be like, it's cute, it's Y!

44:33.583 --> 44:34.984
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I get what they're doing.

44:35.185 --> 44:36.686
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hate the name so much.

44:36.706 --> 44:38.207
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we had the Pico, remember?

44:38.267 --> 44:39.087
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was for kids.

44:39.247 --> 44:45.051
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird, yeah, but Nintendo isn't... You know, Nintendo's trying to reach a broad audience.

44:45.091 --> 44:49.834
[SPEAKER_02]: They want that buzzword, that easy word this time, because they're not trying to reach just gamers.

44:49.874 --> 44:50.555
[SPEAKER_02]: They want everybody.

44:50.875 --> 44:53.297
[SPEAKER_02]: They want Oprah to come out and talk about her Wii.

44:54.678 --> 44:54.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii!

44:55.842 --> 44:57.523
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been calling it the Nintendo Wii.

44:58.323 --> 45:02.284
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, all those potty jokes and things, Nintendo, I think, hopes to transcend that.

45:02.684 --> 45:09.566
[SPEAKER_02]: By, if they can get the name Wii out there, then, you know, I'm going to go home and play with my Wii is not going to have the same connotation that it does today.

45:09.926 --> 45:12.187
[SPEAKER_02]: If Nintendo can get over that, then they've been truly successful.

45:12.227 --> 45:13.187
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can't, they're doomed.

45:13.587 --> 45:19.749
[SPEAKER_03]: We've actually been having a bit of discussion about this on one of the moderator boards I'm on about how

45:21.334 --> 45:22.455
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just been back and forth.

45:22.555 --> 45:26.737
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all decided, though, that they had to have been on heroin when they came up with the name.

45:28.898 --> 45:30.059
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

45:30.819 --> 45:40.824
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like something, to me, and I'm speculating here, it seems like something that kind of Nintendo Japan probably came up with, and America, once they kind of gave their reasons, America was like, okay, we could do that.

45:41.525 --> 45:45.066
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize everybody's like, why didn't you just keep the revolution?

45:45.607 --> 45:47.047
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't you just keep the revolution?

45:47.067 --> 45:47.648
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

45:48.513 --> 45:52.816
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how difficult that might be to pronounce for some people outside the US?

45:53.336 --> 45:55.138
[SPEAKER_02]: You might as well call it the Nintendo Prell.

45:55.538 --> 45:58.960
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you guys will get that joke.

45:59.320 --> 46:02.783
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they wanted something very simplistic.

46:03.043 --> 46:04.504
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole thing they're going for.

46:04.724 --> 46:07.906
[SPEAKER_02]: Revolution also has a negative context in some places.

46:07.966 --> 46:10.028
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the game Dance Dance Revolution.

46:10.348 --> 46:13.470
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't call it that in Europe because of the term revolution.

46:13.530 --> 46:13.830
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

46:13.850 --> 46:14.831
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody gets offended by it.

46:15.392 --> 46:30.731
[SPEAKER_02]: they call it Dancing Stage which is a completely different name so I think Revolution wouldn't have worked worldwide and I don't think there's been a console that's changed their name from country to country in a while I mean yes we had Famicom, NES, Megadrive, Genesis but you know in the past

46:31.195 --> 46:32.075
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47:01.680 --> 47:03.261
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, we had the Pico.

47:03.681 --> 47:05.662
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a system named After Food.

47:06.322 --> 47:12.365
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're seriously not going to buy this because you don't want a Wii in your house... I don't mind having a Wii in my house.

47:12.405 --> 47:18.968
[SPEAKER_02]: Then Nintendo would make the following suggestions to you based on a recent rebuttal argument that was made on some websites out there.

47:19.288 --> 47:20.829
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fly Virgin Atlantic.

47:21.389 --> 47:22.930
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't drink naked juice.

47:23.510 --> 47:26.912
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go to Yahoo or Google because those are all silly names too.

47:29.504 --> 47:30.364
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

47:30.644 --> 47:31.325
[SPEAKER_02]: I get what Nintendo's doing.

47:31.365 --> 47:39.429
[SPEAKER_03]: In the world of advertising, being that that's part of what I am in school, you have to do something that's going to be easily memorable.

47:40.529 --> 47:45.572
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that people are going to talk about and is immediately catching.

47:46.612 --> 47:48.573
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've got all three of that already.

47:49.093 --> 47:50.794
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you forget Wii?

47:51.194 --> 47:53.175
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everybody is talking about it because, oh my god, Wii!

47:54.396 --> 47:54.876
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

47:55.396 --> 47:56.617
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, on top of that...

47:57.634 --> 47:58.477
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy.

47:59.058 --> 47:59.600
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there.

47:59.680 --> 48:00.222
[SPEAKER_03]: It's we.

48:01.365 --> 48:05.366
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Nintendo did a very risky, ballsy thing with this.

48:05.406 --> 48:11.668
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not trying to say that, oh, I may be a little bit of a Nintendo fanboy, but I'm just a gaming fanboy.

48:11.708 --> 48:12.528
[SPEAKER_02]: I like all the systems.

48:13.009 --> 48:16.230
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think Nintendo's just taking a big risk with this.

48:16.310 --> 48:19.330
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an interesting choice, but it's a risky choice.

48:20.031 --> 48:21.851
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're taking a big risk with this.

48:22.251 --> 48:26.353
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody said that this next-gen console war is going to be an easy fight, right?

48:26.573 --> 48:27.553
[SPEAKER_02]: They can change their mind too.

48:28.359 --> 48:28.939
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they will.

48:29.079 --> 48:36.784
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the internet is convinced there's been stories that, well, the Wii's not trademarked so it's not the real name and all this other conspiracy theories.

48:37.304 --> 48:39.765
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I don't really see that happening.

48:40.326 --> 48:42.487
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the name of the console, so enjoy it.

48:42.687 --> 48:49.811
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I do have to say that I think Sony has really had the best idea overall with keeping a single name and just adding a number.

48:51.744 --> 48:53.065
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

48:54.365 --> 48:57.687
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm in Nintendo's shoes, I can say it's the same thing.

48:57.747 --> 48:58.607
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same old thing.

48:58.647 --> 49:00.228
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just another freaking game thing.

49:00.268 --> 49:01.088
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another game system.

49:01.368 --> 49:03.069
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo doesn't want that this time.

49:03.129 --> 49:07.631
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo wants something bigger than your typical game system.

49:07.811 --> 49:09.651
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end, it's a game system.

49:10.352 --> 49:10.532
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

49:10.552 --> 49:15.314
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to escape the fact that they are still marketing games.

49:16.394 --> 49:21.037
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not trying to market to non-gamers, they're trying to make non-gamers into gamers.

49:22.197 --> 49:24.719
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, they're trying to convert the masses.

49:25.219 --> 49:33.103
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remember, as you post to message forums your angst about how much you hate the name Wii, please remember the golden rule of gaming.

49:34.024 --> 49:36.625
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the system, it's the games that are on it.

49:36.745 --> 49:39.467
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

49:39.547 --> 49:41.088
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know what?

49:42.268 --> 49:45.110
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's good games on this, you'll be proud to be a Wii owner.

49:47.423 --> 49:48.684
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have always wanted a wee.

49:49.184 --> 49:50.926
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime... Oh my god, wee!

49:53.868 --> 49:55.269
[SPEAKER_02]: And now for the real outro.

49:58.572 --> 50:01.034
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

50:01.354 --> 50:04.677
