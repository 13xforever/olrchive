WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.400
Tonight, April 30th, 2006, we talk about the new PSP firmware.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.680
What are we all assuming Microsoft might show at E3?

00:22.680 --> 00:31.880
And we get excited about Luminous 2 News!

00:31.880 --> 00:36.080
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:36.080 --> 00:37.080
Radio.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.520
We are that video game podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know.

00:41.520 --> 00:42.720
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.320
You might know me as Sky.

00:44.320 --> 00:48.880
Joining me as always in that corner over there, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:48.880 --> 00:49.880
Yo, what up?

00:49.880 --> 00:50.880
How you doing?

00:50.880 --> 00:53.880
I've just been going wee all day. I'm so happy.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.380
Alright, you're just in a good mood.

00:55.380 --> 00:56.380
Yeah.

00:56.380 --> 01:00.880
Alright, and not here tonight. Don't say hello to Loki because he's not here.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.880
He who is about to die.

01:02.880 --> 01:06.380
That's right, he's getting married which means his soul is forever gone.

01:06.380 --> 01:10.380
Hey, I still have my soul and I'm married, but I married a gamer.

01:10.380 --> 01:18.380
Alright, so in all seriousness, congratulations to Matt and Ellie who are tying the knot on Sunday night.

01:18.380 --> 01:19.380
Yay!

01:19.380 --> 01:24.660
on Saturday this week, so not joining us tonight is the chat room and the skype line, it's

01:24.660 --> 01:25.660
just us.

01:25.660 --> 01:26.660
Oh darn.

01:26.660 --> 01:30.560
So we're not calling this an official episode, this is a mini episode.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.380
I like episodelet.

01:32.380 --> 01:33.500
An a little episodelet?

01:33.500 --> 01:36.420
I like that name too, we'll call it an episodelet.

01:36.420 --> 01:37.420
Like a nugget.

01:37.420 --> 01:38.420
Yes, a little episodelet.

01:38.420 --> 01:43.380
That's kind of gross, it's a nugget.

01:43.380 --> 01:47.300
So this is our little episodelet for this April 29th, 2006.

01:47.300 --> 01:50.420
There will be no Part B this week, so please don't be looking for it.

01:50.420 --> 01:52.540
We're only going to do about half a show tonight.

01:52.540 --> 01:55.740
It's been kind of a slow news week, too, all things considered.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.900
I guarantee you Wednesday, where's Part B?

01:57.900 --> 01:58.900
Yeah, I know.

01:58.900 --> 02:00.620
They'll be posting, where's Part B?

02:00.620 --> 02:02.220
There's no Part B this week.

02:02.220 --> 02:05.540
I'll put up a picture of a face sticking out of tongue and go, there's your Part B.

02:05.540 --> 02:12.820
No, but we'll be back, of course, next week with a huge E3 preview show, everything we

02:12.820 --> 02:15.500
We can't wait to do it, E3.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.860
And of course, we'll be back the week after that as well.

02:17.860 --> 02:19.620
We're not going to be taking any shows off during E3.

02:19.620 --> 02:21.660
In fact, you get bonus shows.

02:21.660 --> 02:22.700
Here's the deal.

02:22.700 --> 02:27.020
We're actually going to be doing podcasts each day of the show, like we did last year.

02:27.020 --> 02:32.060
However, we're going to be working with our partner, AllGames.com, to produce these shows.

02:32.060 --> 02:35.340
They're actually going to be letting us use their studios over at the Arena Interactive

02:35.340 --> 02:38.400
Lounge to be taping the shows, so it's going to be pretty cool.

02:38.400 --> 02:45.120
So you'll actually be able to hear us taping all this live on AllGames.com, 6.30-ish each

02:45.120 --> 02:46.120
day of the show.

02:46.120 --> 02:50.880
I'm saying 6.30-ish because we're going to be the first show on right after the expo

02:50.880 --> 02:51.880
is over.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.760
So we may end up getting to start a little early and we may end up having to start a

02:54.760 --> 02:55.760
little late.

02:55.760 --> 02:59.520
All technical things aside, but the goal time is 6.30-ish.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.960
I may find John Cena again this year and stalk him.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.160
I didn't know he was an E3 team.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.160
He was there last year.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.160
He's a wrestler.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.480
Are you gonna stalk celebrities, C-list celebrities?

03:08.480 --> 03:11.160
I might bump into a few more celebrities, who knows?

03:11.160 --> 03:14.880
Like I bumped into Kojima the year before, and I bumped into Miyamoto last year, and

03:14.880 --> 03:15.880
this is literal.

03:15.880 --> 03:21.600
I think the best celebrity I met last year was probably Togo, who did the music in, well,

03:21.600 --> 03:22.760
some of the music in BB&A 2D action.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.840
A certain other famous person who I wanted to talk to was off talking to somebody else

03:26.840 --> 03:29.400
while we were doing an interview that never happened.

03:29.400 --> 03:34.220
Also regarding the E3

03:34.220 --> 03:37.520
Outpost, you can actually come see us in person if you want. It's a

03:37.520 --> 03:41.180
open invite party. You don't have to be an E3 attendee to go.

03:41.180 --> 03:44.340
It's E3outpost.com if you want the details on that.

03:44.340 --> 03:48.700
Who doesn't want to meet us? We're gonna be there and

03:48.700 --> 03:52.580
Scott Rubin, the infamous G4 guy, is gonna be there.

03:52.580 --> 03:57.460
I think Gamer Andy is doing something as well if you guys read his blog.

03:57.460 --> 04:01.420
so he's gonna be doing something as well. So it should be a good time. It's just gonna be an internet

04:01.420 --> 04:03.580
celebrity fest. It's gonna be a podcast orgy.

04:03.580 --> 04:07.240
Yes it is. Yes, with no nudity though. No. Because we don't need any of that. None of the naked, but

04:07.240 --> 04:11.320
you know, people wanna bring me chocolate. We can have a chocolate podcast orgy, that'll be fun.

04:11.320 --> 04:15.380
Chocolate podcast orgy. Alright. That's it, anyone who comes and meets me has to bring me dark chocolate.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.660
Or a dollar. Or a dollar. Alright, let's cut the crap and get to

04:19.660 --> 04:23.220
how our gaming week was. Dark Sockro. You cut the crap?

04:23.220 --> 04:25.220
Bye everybody!

04:25.220 --> 04:27.220
Oh, I guess that's it for the show!

04:27.220 --> 04:29.220
No.

04:29.220 --> 04:31.220
How was your gaming week, DarkSaga?

04:31.220 --> 04:33.220
Um, I played a buttload of Ragnarok yesterday.

04:33.220 --> 04:35.220
And I played a buttload of Ragnarok today.

04:35.220 --> 04:38.220
Instead of doing the rest of my homework today,

04:38.220 --> 04:40.220
I played a buttload of Ragnarok!

04:40.220 --> 04:42.220
I'm so responsible.

04:42.220 --> 04:44.220
The thing is that it was due two weeks ago.

04:44.220 --> 04:46.220
Um, no.

04:46.220 --> 04:49.220
I tried to play some Kingdom Hearts last weekend,

04:49.220 --> 04:51.220
because I wasn't here last week,

04:51.220 --> 04:58.000
Because one of my really good friends and a listener of ours Disney Punk 10 came up to hang out

04:58.300 --> 05:00.420
for my birthday week, which was a

05:01.120 --> 05:03.120
drunken and

05:04.560 --> 05:09.600
More drunken good times. I talked to I talked about Dave and Busters on last week's show is good times

05:09.800 --> 05:14.520
Yeah, I actually did not get as insanely drunk this year as I did the year before because now I'm grown up

05:14.520 --> 05:21.320
up you'll never be a grown-up you still you still you still play games games are

05:21.320 --> 05:30.720
for kids hey obviously I'm joking I wasn't playing with my dolls yeah oh you

05:30.720 --> 05:35.400
know though I found out a piece of it oh yeah so Silent Hill three times I went

05:35.400 --> 05:38.520
on last Friday oh we didn't get to hear your feedback on the movie obviously you

05:38.520 --> 05:41.520
liked it oh yeah I went Friday and then I went

05:41.520 --> 05:45.060
against Sunday and then I went Wednesday and I drug Julie with me is it possible

05:45.060 --> 05:49.860
to see a movie too much no I'm gonna go again hopefully before we go to e3 and I

05:49.860 --> 05:53.420
think I'm gonna see it while I'm at e3 because I'm one of the DDR freak

05:53.420 --> 05:58.500
moderators as from South America and he hasn't this not opening there for a

05:58.500 --> 06:03.180
while so we're gonna probably bring him to see it at some point that's cool but

06:03.180 --> 06:05.180
I

06:06.700 --> 06:13.980
Forgot oh, yes, I know oh my god red pyramid. I was like you could kill me. I'd die happy I

06:14.580 --> 06:21.900
Thought that they actually got like an actual actor to play him in the janitor cuz like he moves so

06:22.500 --> 06:26.100
Fluidly, it's just like oh, yeah, I could watch that for hours

06:26.660 --> 06:30.360
Somebody at the I was I was out at the club last night and some of us were talking about

06:30.360 --> 06:33.920
Silent Hill the movie and somebody called him triangle head that made me

06:33.920 --> 06:39.120
laugh because I think it's exactly exactly where my mind went to this is

06:39.120 --> 06:43.360
how we know we're both dorks cuz my mind went exactly triangle man triangle man

06:43.360 --> 06:48.720
you know and if you catch that reference you too my friend is a live journal icon

06:48.720 --> 06:55.240
where I had had pyramid head as triangle man and what was the guy in the second

06:55.240 --> 07:03.880
game James mm-hmm as person man all right games gaming okay yeah um I I hit

07:03.880 --> 07:09.360
level 43 for my job class which means I have seven more stupid job levels to go

07:09.360 --> 07:15.560
or you that you are a certified dork hey I'm not the one who was on this is your

07:15.560 --> 07:22.360
gaming week not my gaming week okay drama no this is definitely an off

07:22.360 --> 07:29.920
night for us um but yeah and then I am I worked on something I'm doing for

07:29.920 --> 07:35.240
Kingdom Hearts fan art opportunity with a friend so I've actually been sort of

07:35.240 --> 07:40.720
artsy gamey sort of trying to get back into my old you know nerd hobbies but

07:40.720 --> 07:44.520
school sort of kicking my ass but I think I'm doing a flashlight based off a

07:44.520 --> 07:47.120
video game I'm just not sure if I'm gonna do Silent Hill like I've done all

07:47.120 --> 07:51.280
my other homework I might just do something about a guardian legend

07:51.280 --> 07:58.120
tribute page in Flash, that would rock. Though it has to be a digital poem. So I think I'm

07:58.120 --> 08:03.120
just gonna do like some like really stupid poem that have like art that has nothing to

08:03.120 --> 08:09.120
do with it, like half of those do. Alright. Hooray for Flash, Nott. Anything else? Who

08:09.120 --> 08:15.000
wants to do my Flash homework for me? Not me, my gaming week, I played Final Fantasy

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
11 a little bit, actually more than a little bit, I played a lot, like Monday, Tuesday,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.280
Wednesday, I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI, so I'm kind of like on a little mini

08:24.280 --> 08:29.560
break, I'm taking a little mini vacation from it, but otherwise, the only really new game

08:29.560 --> 08:33.480
I played was Project Gotham Racing 3, which isn't really a new game because it was an

08:33.480 --> 08:38.300
Xbox 360 launch title, but Loki let me borrow it, and so it's about like the 50th racing

08:38.300 --> 08:40.560
game I played on the 360.

08:40.560 --> 08:41.560
Download the Speed Pack.

08:41.560 --> 08:43.600
I forgot to mention Dan downloaded the Speed Pack.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.600
Doesn't that cost points?

08:45.600 --> 08:50.600
Yeah, however, the cars that are in it are so worth it. One of them is the EVO 8MR.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.600
Maybe. I don't know. I don't know how I feel about this game still.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.600
I like the game. I think it's pretty. I think it's got a great interface.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.600
And I think it's a very fluid interface and it's great to get into.

09:00.600 --> 09:07.600
But the racing itself, I found you have to use different tactics in this game than you do in other types of games like Ridge Racer.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.600
And that kind of threw me at first.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.600
It depends on your car too.

09:09.600 --> 09:15.840
Yeah, and I understand why is that it's not a game about like drifting. It's more of like a street race type thing

09:15.840 --> 09:17.840
It's it's just a different style of

09:18.220 --> 09:22.460
Racing but it really threw me having played all these other racing games where you know

09:22.700 --> 09:26.500
Release the gas while you turn then hit the gas so you kind of do that drifting

09:26.500 --> 09:30.300
You're not really I mean you can do that in Project Gotham, but I slam into walls every time

09:30.300 --> 09:32.140
So you have to really alter the strategy

09:32.140 --> 09:35.940
I had to read up on game facts how to do a frickin turn right in that game

09:35.940 --> 09:41.840
My suggestion is actually to do the in-car play of you. Mm-hmm when you're playing it actually does make a difference

09:41.840 --> 09:46.760
I you know what maybe I get a little motion sick sometimes too because that view makes me all like weird

09:46.760 --> 09:48.280
I get all the more perfect

09:48.280 --> 09:53.380
I know it's pretty low as a flaw being that I'm a Lancer freak since I drive a Lancer

09:53.640 --> 10:01.280
They did the interior for the evo 9 inside the evo 8mr. Wow, that's nerdy. That is nerdy pretty awesome. You know that though

10:01.280 --> 10:07.560
I like that you can test drive all the cars though, even the expensive ones.

10:07.560 --> 10:11.280
You can go to the expensive ones and do the test drive so you can see how they play.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.120
It's a fun game and I will probably play more of it.

10:14.120 --> 10:17.420
I just was a little like, whoa, this is a little bit different, but I love that it's

10:17.420 --> 10:19.260
so fluid.

10:19.260 --> 10:21.680
It is definitely one of the better racing games on 360.

10:21.680 --> 10:26.080
I was kind of surprised because I didn't think it would be the type of game I like, but I

10:26.080 --> 10:27.080
really enjoyed it.

10:27.080 --> 10:32.460
for all these people that like to loop racing games in one big pile and call

10:32.460 --> 10:36.380
them all just like racing games you know like they're all the same you need to

10:36.380 --> 10:41.840
play this then play something like with guns like full auto or burnout something

10:41.840 --> 10:46.220
where destruction is the main factor and then play something like initial well I

10:46.220 --> 10:49.140
know initial D is not on 360 but maybe something like Ridge Racer where it's

10:49.140 --> 10:53.340
more about drifting and you'll see like the big differences between these racing

10:53.340 --> 10:56.620
games. I would have to loop the Project Gotham series in with like the Grand

10:56.620 --> 11:01.580
Turismo series. It plays similarly. More on the realistic side of

11:01.580 --> 11:05.580
of car motion than... Probably fair to say that Project Gotham was probably

11:05.580 --> 11:06.780
designed as a

11:06.780 --> 11:11.620
direct competitor. So, anyway. That was pretty much my game of the week. I didn't play a whole

11:11.620 --> 11:14.020
lot besides that. I've been doing my brain training every day though.

11:14.020 --> 11:17.300
I'm getting good. I hadn't yet to purchase that. I feel that I don't need it.

11:17.300 --> 11:21.780
Oh, I think you need to be doing the little quiz on mine and then we'll see

11:21.780 --> 11:23.900
how old your brain is and then that might

11:23.900 --> 11:28.700
Might change your mind. My brain is 50 million years old.

11:28.700 --> 11:32.860
No, that's a bad, you want to get it down. One. You want your brain age 20 is the lowest you can go.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.980
I'm 21 now. I'm 21 now. I'm working on it.

11:35.980 --> 11:42.620
How about some gaming news? Big news in the gaming industry. Huge,

11:42.620 --> 11:46.840
huge news in the gaming industry this week from Sony.

11:46.840 --> 11:50.300
Sony has upgraded their PSP Flash

11:50.300 --> 11:53.700
firmware, I'm sorry, their PSP firmware to 2.70

11:53.700 --> 11:57.020
to include flash support.

11:57.020 --> 12:00.800
However, I hear it sucks. I hear the flash support

12:00.800 --> 12:04.300
really stinks on this.

12:04.300 --> 12:07.380
Did they say what flash supports? Is it Flash 8?

12:07.380 --> 12:12.260
No, they just say the the release notes say now you can play Macromedia flash

12:12.260 --> 12:13.580
content but here's the thing

12:13.580 --> 12:17.160
you're not really supposed to save the content, like you can't play content that

12:17.160 --> 12:17.860
was saved

12:17.860 --> 12:21.020
although supposedly people have found a way around that like you access it from

12:21.020 --> 12:21.860
your browser

12:21.860 --> 12:24.740
but there's no way to like launch just like, let's say you want to download

12:24.740 --> 12:26.860
Homestar Runner movies and watch them at your convenience,

12:26.860 --> 12:30.620
you can't really do that. It doesn't really work that way. And they say that

12:30.620 --> 12:31.860
Flash games

12:31.860 --> 12:35.500
run like, I was reading web forms, Flash games run like two frames a second, like

12:35.500 --> 12:36.180
they're horrible.

12:36.180 --> 12:40.380
So the Flash support is there but needs a little bit of improvement.

12:40.380 --> 12:44.340
I can work around that. Yeah, we'll see. Who knows, we might be seeing our own content in

12:44.340 --> 12:44.980
Flash.

12:44.980 --> 12:48.340
Possibly, although I don't know, we may want to wait till this gets better

12:48.340 --> 12:51.700
because this, from what I'm hearing, the feedback, not worth the upgrade.

12:51.700 --> 12:54.780
the feedback I'm hearing on the forums is that this is not worth the upgrade right now

12:54.780 --> 12:58.580
I wouldn't mind testing it. I really would not mind designing something and testing it out

12:58.580 --> 13:00.780
Well you still have my PSP so I guess you could do that

13:00.780 --> 13:02.700
Yes I do. It will be coming with us to E3

13:02.700 --> 13:07.580
Alright. Sounds good. Yeah there's plenty of reasons why everybody should bring their PSPs to E3

13:07.580 --> 13:10.660
My husband still has not got me my PSP

13:10.660 --> 13:11.500
Really?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.100
Because I think we're getting a camcorder

13:13.100 --> 13:15.580
Well you need to get a PSP out of that too

13:15.580 --> 13:20.580
Let's see what else has been added in the PSP 2.7 upgrade

13:20.580 --> 13:25.580
UMD video L and R button has been added because you can disable the

13:25.580 --> 13:28.220
channel skip feature with the L and R buttons.

13:28.220 --> 13:31.500
I've done this before like it's too easy to accidentally knock those buttons or

13:31.500 --> 13:31.940
hit them.

13:31.940 --> 13:35.020
So you can disable that.

13:35.020 --> 13:39.300
AAC is now playable on the PSP as well which is a very popular

13:39.300 --> 13:42.480
iTunes and Apple codec so that's pretty cool.

13:42.480 --> 13:46.580
So if you want to check that out all you have to do is just on your PSP you can

13:46.580 --> 13:48.500
update the firmware. Keep in mind

13:48.500 --> 13:51.980
for those you guys that like to do controversial things on your PSP which

13:51.980 --> 13:53.580
involve downgrading your firmware

13:53.580 --> 13:57.260
2.7 will lock all that out because obviously they fixed all those loopholes

13:57.260 --> 13:57.700
so

13:57.700 --> 14:01.060
something to consider before you do this. Where one loophole

14:01.060 --> 14:05.060
closes another one opens. That is very true. Speaking of Sony

14:05.060 --> 14:08.580
rumor is that Sony is going to keep their mouth shut when it comes to the

14:08.580 --> 14:09.140
price

14:09.140 --> 14:12.180
of the PlayStation 3 at this year's E3.

14:12.180 --> 14:15.260
Reports are saying on CNN

14:15.260 --> 14:19.940
is that Sony is not going to talk about the price of their console until the end of

14:19.940 --> 14:20.580
the summer

14:20.580 --> 14:25.940
at the earliest. Now, of course, the only time when this can really be confirmed

14:25.940 --> 14:27.140
is E3,

14:27.140 --> 14:30.500
but I would say perhaps I think there's actually truth in this.

14:30.500 --> 14:34.020
I think maybe they will keep quiet about the price.

14:34.020 --> 14:37.220
I think they just want to show the goods, and I think this whole

14:37.220 --> 14:41.940
Blu-ray kind of factor will probably determine. I mean, because we still really

14:41.940 --> 14:43.100
don't know, like,

14:43.100 --> 14:46.260
Are the games gonna be Blu-ray? I mean, they say it is.

14:46.260 --> 14:50.780
Is it movies? I mean, are we still... I mean, certainly websites out there are talking

14:50.780 --> 14:53.980
about one way or the other, but we still really don't know what Sony's plan

14:53.980 --> 14:57.900
really is for that. So I think until that's been established, it's really hard to

14:57.900 --> 14:59.720
get the price. So we'll see.

14:59.720 --> 15:03.720
I mean, I could be wrong. I'd like them to release the price, and I think I'm

15:03.720 --> 15:05.060
pretty sure it's going to be

15:05.060 --> 15:09.300
$399 to be competitive with the Xbox 360, even though rumor is they're gonna drop

15:09.300 --> 15:09.820
price.

15:09.820 --> 15:13.420
but I don't think we'll know for sure till end of summer it seems

15:13.420 --> 15:16.580
it seems fair. That was pretty much as much as the PlayStation was

15:16.580 --> 15:20.420
the PS2 was released for when it came out. And wasn't the PlayStation 1 about that

15:20.420 --> 15:21.500
much when it came out too?

15:21.500 --> 15:26.580
Maybe at least $2.99? No, yeah it was around $2.99 if I remember correctly because I

15:26.580 --> 15:30.420
I didn't have one I was there when someone bought one because it lived in my dorm room

15:30.420 --> 15:33.540
he didn't have a TV. But

15:33.540 --> 15:37.500
well the the price of a dollar's gone you know different directions since then so

15:37.500 --> 15:44.660
Alright, one other thing that we can expect on Sony is a very popular franchise's sequel,

15:44.660 --> 15:45.660
correct?

15:45.660 --> 15:46.660
Lumines2.

15:46.660 --> 15:47.660
Awesome.

15:47.660 --> 15:55.940
It sounds like there was a mention into this video.

15:55.940 --> 16:02.060
They were saying that it's probably going to be officially revealed over at E3.

16:02.060 --> 16:06.820
They made a mention of Lumines2 is coming out, so maybe we'll see that at E3.

16:06.820 --> 16:10.100
I think there's some early screenshots that have leaked of Luminous 2, so I'm pretty sure

16:10.100 --> 16:13.660
we're going to see some of that at E3, that would be pretty awesome, at least I hope so.

16:13.660 --> 16:16.180
I want a playable demo at E3, I don't want no movie.

16:16.180 --> 16:21.020
I want a playable demo, and I want it to have music that was as good as the first one.

16:21.020 --> 16:22.420
Absolutely, yeah, that's one.

16:22.420 --> 16:27.780
And plus, the other question about Luminous 2 is, what exactly are they going to change?

16:27.780 --> 16:28.780
Because there's...

16:28.780 --> 16:29.780
Why change anything?

16:29.780 --> 16:30.780
It's good.

16:30.780 --> 16:34.620
Yeah, but then, you know, what makes me have to own Luminous 2 if I own Luminous 1 and

16:34.620 --> 16:35.620
it's the same game?

16:35.620 --> 16:36.620
New music!

16:36.620 --> 16:41.460
music worth special art new unlockable content there's got to be something

16:41.460 --> 16:46.220
there's gonna there's gotta be foreign even like a couple new blocks but just

16:46.220 --> 16:49.500
don't make the same mistakes the Tetris franchise did I mean I guess at the same

16:49.500 --> 16:54.440
time Tetris DS is still Tetris right it'll be luminous with like Sony

16:54.440 --> 17:02.740
characters we'll see other huge huge huge news in the gaming industry this

17:02.740 --> 17:08.080
week from Microsoft and Microsoft has said that they are going to be

17:08.080 --> 17:12.200
previewing E3 well actually they haven't said this is just a rumor but you know

17:12.200 --> 17:15.400
Microsoft you know they're gonna show Halo 3 because they've got to derail the

17:15.400 --> 17:18.520
Thunder from whatever Sony's gonna bring whatever Nintendo is gonna break they've

17:18.520 --> 17:22.520
got to derail the Thunder so Halo 3 they are saying is going to be previewed at

17:22.520 --> 17:27.120
the conference rumor has it it's a two minute video nothing playable yet kids

17:27.120 --> 17:33.980
Sorry, but a video will still be enough to kind of get that just get that cravens in for

17:34.380 --> 17:37.880
Make sure that you bring Kleenex. Mm-hmm to wipe the drool

17:37.960 --> 17:42.200
Yeah that in it, you know that the fanboys are going to be having over the game

17:43.000 --> 17:46.520
Absolutely. So check that out. That's gonna be a good one at e3

17:47.640 --> 17:51.880
Jamie another franchise with a sequel that which could be shown at e3

17:51.880 --> 17:56.080
This is some pretty cool news. Looks like Red Octane and Harmonics are looking for

17:56.080 --> 18:02.740
indie musicians to put their stuff in Guitar Hero 2. There is a contest at

18:02.740 --> 18:08.920
BeAGuitarHero.com so musicians can send in their own hard rock heavy metal

18:08.920 --> 18:14.700
stuff that features a lead guitar over you know as an mp3 format over the

18:14.700 --> 18:19.280
internet for them to review. Guitar Hero 2 was announced actually this month

18:19.280 --> 18:26.280
saying there'd be new play modes, a new track list, 40 license, 15 unlockable, independent,

18:26.280 --> 18:30.120
and of course, Gibson's got support in this one again.

18:30.120 --> 18:33.260
But I think that the contest is really neat because it's gonna, you know, we were introduced

18:33.260 --> 18:39.040
to a lot more, there, I would say there's actually more bands local to, I guess, this

18:39.040 --> 18:45.440
whole area, but it introduced people to a lot more bands, you know, I just think that

18:45.440 --> 18:48.280
that was a really, a really neat thing.

18:48.280 --> 18:52.480
I think it was really cool of Red Octane to put all those independent bands right alongside

18:52.480 --> 18:56.900
the classic hits, you know, and the fact that they kept Freezepop made me giddy too, because

18:56.900 --> 18:58.400
you know I love me some Freezepop.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.280
So I hope they come back for the sequel, they better.

19:00.280 --> 19:04.440
There was that news, though, about the Hidden Track.

19:04.440 --> 19:07.040
That's true, I remember reading something about that, that there's a Hidden Track.

19:07.040 --> 19:13.600
So it was actually posted up on our website, one, and you know, I just had a brain fart

19:13.600 --> 19:18.200
and forgot the name of it, but it's triple something.

19:18.200 --> 19:24.200
It's another indie band. It's not a song that I recognized as a classic rock song.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.200
It sounds more like progressive rock.

19:26.200 --> 19:30.200
Yeah, it was put up on Kotaku. There's a video there.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.200
The song is called...

19:35.200 --> 19:36.200
Oh, poo.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.200
Now, it's not something you can access, though.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.200
You have to use codes.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.200
Well, not like up, up, down, down, left, right codes. You have to use like a...

19:42.200 --> 19:43.200
Triplet.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.200
Yeah.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.200
Triplet's the name of the song.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.080
What's a code thing on PlayStation called?

19:48.080 --> 19:50.960
CodeShark, GameShark, CodeBreaker, whatever, one of those things.

19:50.960 --> 19:55.680
Pro Action Replay, but I did, even though the video is not the greatest,

19:55.680 --> 20:00.240
this song is freaking hard. There's no way I'd ever be able to play that one, but

20:00.240 --> 20:01.960
it's an expert level song.

20:01.960 --> 20:05.720
Why did they take it out, I wonder? I think just because the style of the song doesn't

20:05.720 --> 20:06.760
necessarily fit

20:06.760 --> 20:10.200
the styles of the rest of the game. I mean, then again, we've got Freeze Pop in there, so

20:10.200 --> 20:13.400
hello? But it is very, very, you know, progressive

20:13.400 --> 20:17.240
rock. I mean, it's a good song. It's a really good song.

20:17.240 --> 20:20.640
But what happens is that the song Guitar Hero in the game,

20:20.640 --> 20:24.560
it actually replaces it. It's not gonna

20:24.560 --> 20:28.420
corrupt your shapefile or anything. You can just reset the game, but when

20:28.420 --> 20:31.760
you put in the code, when you pull up the song list, Triplet will be

20:31.760 --> 20:32.440
selectable.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.520
And it is pretty vicious. It is vicious.

20:35.520 --> 20:39.400
Well, check that out. Well, Kotaku has a little more details in the actual

20:39.400 --> 20:40.240
codes that you need.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.360
They have the codes up, and they also have a video of someone playing it. Awesome.

20:43.360 --> 20:52.460
Moving on to more news about the PSP, LocoRoco has a demo that's downloadable in Japan.

20:52.460 --> 20:57.900
So you can check that out at www.jp.PlayStation.com.

20:57.900 --> 21:00.560
Now you actually have to navigate a little ways to get there.

21:00.560 --> 21:05.140
Loki said he would try and get this on OLRPSP.com though for you guys this week because apparently

21:05.140 --> 21:10.060
even though the demo is only available in Japan right now, it works on the US PSP is

21:10.060 --> 21:11.200
what he said.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.920
So if you don't mind reading a little bit of Japanese,

21:13.920 --> 21:17.400
you can play a demo of LocoRoco, a new PSP game.

21:17.400 --> 21:18.480
Awesome.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.880
Speaking of traveling the world, DarkSakura

21:20.880 --> 21:23.400
likes to once in a while snoop in on new sites

21:23.400 --> 21:26.200
from around the world and pick up stuff from the UK.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.200
So DarkSakura, and of course, news over there,

21:28.200 --> 21:30.640
effects, what goes on over here, et cetera, et cetera.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.040
What'd you pick up from the globe this week?

21:33.040 --> 21:38.360
Well, it looks like CDV's putting up their lineup at E3.

21:38.360 --> 21:39.480
The game's coming out.

21:39.480 --> 21:45.060
Warfront the Turning Point which is World War 2 real-time strategy there's

21:45.060 --> 21:50.280
also War Leaders Clash of Nations and then their first DS game Panzer Tactics

21:50.280 --> 21:57.340
DS which is World War 2 again turn-based strategy Pacific Storm which is sort of

21:57.340 --> 22:02.940
turn-based and real-time then again it's more World War 2 it sounds like they're

22:02.940 --> 22:07.860
sort of stuck in the 1940s there for a bit also there will be Heroes of

22:07.860 --> 22:15.220
Annihilated Empires the open beta has actually just launched for that one and

22:15.220 --> 22:21.700
Darkstar one which is a sci-fi action game about a pilot trying to solve a

22:21.700 --> 22:26.780
mystery hmm sounds pretty cool I mean I'll definitely look up you know

22:26.780 --> 22:31.200
anything I mean I personally am not into the strategy games but I love anything

22:31.200 --> 22:35.640
historical so I always go buy some of those even even if I don't care about

22:35.640 --> 22:39.460
about the game itself I go to to look and see how accurate are they you know

22:39.460 --> 22:43.200
look at the demos I think that's pretty cool cool I like games that teach you

22:43.200 --> 22:47.800
something yeah and it kind of reminds me of you really got a kick out that story

22:47.800 --> 22:54.680
a while back remember the MMO that had the crucified guy yeah yeah well guess

22:54.680 --> 23:00.000
what hmm there's gonna be a Marvel action RPG that makes me happy awesome

23:00.000 --> 23:06.240
it actually says it's gonna have more than the standard X-Men franchise that

23:06.240 --> 23:10.740
we typically see as of late. Activision and Raven are gonna put this out on

23:10.740 --> 23:15.720
damn near everything so I'm sure if you've got the system it'll play it you

23:15.720 --> 23:20.280
know short of like the PC Engine or something. So it's going to be called

23:20.280 --> 23:25.560
Marvel Ultimate Alliance it will be out actually on the next-gen and current

23:25.560 --> 23:30.360
gen ones including the handheld PC and more than 20 playable Marvel characters

23:30.360 --> 23:34.920
with a like spider-man Wolverine blade Captain America supposed to be out in

23:34.920 --> 23:41.520
the fall basically it's supposed to be the usual you know not just the fate of

23:41.520 --> 23:46.840
the earth but the entire Marvel Universe thing choose your own adventure oh no I

23:46.840 --> 23:51.800
push the red button the world explodes type of thing it's got a new combat

23:51.800 --> 23:58.640
system you have air combat ground underwater you have power charging melee

23:58.640 --> 24:04.280
weapons you have not only are you going to be able to choose your characters you

24:04.280 --> 24:08.260
actually will make your team a different Marvel characters you will have

24:08.260 --> 24:13.180
different things to represent them it's supposed to be really customizable it's

24:13.180 --> 24:18.260
it's as far as your actions actually determine the app that you know how the

24:18.260 --> 24:26.460
game goes. I think sort of fable, you know, in that respect. And, of course, I have the

24:26.460 --> 24:32.460
release dates for this month. Actually, there's not really any days left for

24:32.460 --> 24:35.340
this month, so I will give the ones for the first week of May. How does that sound?

24:35.340 --> 24:42.220
Okay. We have coming out on the first Beetle King, we have, okay, I've never

24:42.220 --> 24:47.620
heard of this, but Goo Goo Noggett on DS. No, Goo Goo Goo Goo Noggett is what it

24:47.620 --> 24:53.140
says me and my Katamari on the fifth coming on PSP Metroid Prime Hunters on

24:53.140 --> 24:57.580
the DS Sam could museum 50th anniversary on the GameCube Pac-man world 3 on the

24:57.580 --> 25:02.180
various collection of random systems Rainbow Islands revolution I thought

25:02.180 --> 25:07.860
that would make you happy maybe I'm from the DS well no because I thought that

25:07.860 --> 25:13.380
you'd liked oh is it is it it's just like that for real I think it is oh my

25:13.380 --> 25:17.220
gosh okay now I am excited well it's just because I knew that you were a big

25:17.220 --> 25:22.780
Big Bubble Bobble fan. Yeah, I didn't know I didn't realize it would be the same thing. That's cool. Yeah

25:22.780 --> 25:29.540
Um, I actually just pulling this up on Eurogamer and it is Bubble Bobble Rainbow Islands. Very cool

25:29.620 --> 25:31.920
Yeah, see I love Rainbow Islands. That was a great game

25:32.960 --> 25:37.140
We have Rogue Galaxy on the ps2 and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

25:38.980 --> 25:42.140
Coming out. All right. They actually get brain age on the 19th

25:42.140 --> 25:48.460
It's fun, check out last week's show if you want my review.

25:48.460 --> 25:54.020
Coming back stateside, not a whole lot shaking up the industry this week as far as release

25:54.020 --> 25:55.700
dates go.

25:55.700 --> 25:59.460
Probably because of the upcoming E3, there's not a very big calendar, probably until we

25:59.460 --> 26:00.460
get into June.

26:00.460 --> 26:02.780
However, there are a couple games to look out for.

26:02.780 --> 26:09.980
PlayStation 2 has Gallop Racer 2006 on May 2nd, not Xbox 360, Xbox 360 doesn't really

26:09.980 --> 26:11.820
have anything coming until the end of this month.

26:11.820 --> 26:16.860
The next big release scheduled is Rockstar Games Table Tennis on May 22nd.

26:16.860 --> 26:19.920
However, if you're a PC gamer, this is a good week for you guys.

26:19.920 --> 26:25.580
You guys are getting Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter on May 2nd, and then you're also

26:25.580 --> 26:29.700
getting Desperados 2 as well on May 2nd.

26:29.700 --> 26:36.220
Over on the DS, you are getting Top Gun on May 1st, and Game Boy Advance Dr. Sudoku,

26:36.220 --> 26:37.820
if you really want it, May 1st.

26:37.820 --> 26:38.820
Top Gun?

26:38.820 --> 26:41.160
Does that mean you're going to have the really hard part where you have to, you know, fuel

26:41.160 --> 26:45.160
It is for real Top Gun based on the old movie, if you can believe it.

26:45.160 --> 26:48.160
Actually, I'm thinking of the old Top Gun Nintendo game.

26:48.160 --> 26:52.160
That game pissed me off so much, because I could never land. I'd crash.

26:52.160 --> 26:55.160
I wonder how similar it is to the old NES one. I might have to check that out.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.160
I haven't seen, really, the only...

26:57.160 --> 27:00.160
We need more games, I think, that played like that, like After Burner.

27:00.160 --> 27:05.160
We need a new After Burner. Except I think I'm going to get the Sega Ages.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.160
Well, you got a new Outrun, so you never know.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.160
Actually, we did pick up Outrun 2006.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.160
How is it?

27:09.160 --> 27:14.180
it actually is pretty cool and Dan gets I was making pizza the other day and

27:14.180 --> 27:18.320
Dan's like my girlfriend keeps getting pissed off at me I was like yeah and

27:18.320 --> 27:24.240
your wife's gonna get screaming about it but not it and I thought it was pretty

27:24.240 --> 27:27.920
cool he showed me the little demo mode and it played with like a remix of

27:27.920 --> 27:30.840
magical sound shower which made me all happy because that's my favorite Outrun

27:30.840 --> 27:38.160
song hmm moving on to a follow-up story but this is a follow-up of something

27:38.160 --> 27:41.380
like months old I think we talked about this and I don't even know if we talked

27:41.380 --> 27:44.280
about it on a podcast it might have been one of our live shows I wouldn't call

27:44.280 --> 27:48.860
the following up as much as a we caught up to it kind of well this is the thing

27:48.860 --> 27:53.100
is that there was an article in the mercury I believe it was the San Jose

27:53.100 --> 27:59.300
mercury news that published this it was in the section there it was talking

27:59.300 --> 28:04.060
about a follow-up to the EA spouse you might remember this she had a live

28:04.060 --> 28:09.780
journal and the live journal had talked about all the you know over time things

28:09.780 --> 28:13.700
and shady stuff that was going on at Electronic Arts well she's been revealed

28:13.700 --> 28:19.500
and her name is Erin Hoffman and her husband was Leander Hastie and he was

28:19.500 --> 28:23.740
working on Battle for Middle Earth for Electronic Arts and she's the one that

28:23.740 --> 28:27.940
posted the story and he is not working at EA anymore obviously he's a game

28:27.940 --> 28:32.080
designer over at Playable Productions and kind of interesting I guess what

28:32.080 --> 28:36.400
happened is that he was part of this class action lawsuit about the unpaid

28:36.400 --> 28:41.400
overtime against EA so then they took their story public finally so very

28:41.400 --> 28:44.880
interesting while the legal proceedings are going on they actually advise not to

28:44.880 --> 28:48.080
go public with identity or any type of information because it could hurt the

28:48.080 --> 28:53.760
case I'm not sure I have to be honest I can't remember if it was settled already

28:53.760 --> 28:59.120
or not I think at the time that we read the article they were actually in the

28:59.120 --> 29:05.040
Right, right, right, no, definitely at the time the article first came out, it wasn't.

29:05.040 --> 29:08.840
So I'm just trying to read over it real quick here.

29:08.840 --> 29:15.640
Well I know from having friends who have sued the facilities that they work for, they're

29:15.640 --> 29:20.960
advised not to have any contact with, that is if they've left the company, not to have

29:20.960 --> 29:26.920
any contact with anybody who still works there and not to really reveal the details going

29:26.920 --> 29:31.540
until after it's been settled so I would think that that's been why it's so long

29:31.540 --> 29:36.600
giving that name out hmm well there you have it a little follow-up kind of

29:36.600 --> 29:41.300
always fun to learn the identities of secret people we have our own secret

29:41.300 --> 29:45.460
identities here at Orange Lawns Radio as well we are very angsty people sometimes

29:45.460 --> 29:48.500
we get really mad and ticked off and that's why we have this segment on the

29:48.500 --> 29:53.700
show called the FUs of the week where we have the chance to spread a little hate

29:53.700 --> 29:55.700
to all the kids of America, right Jamie?

29:55.700 --> 29:57.700
Grr, argh.

30:07.700 --> 30:12.700
Well, I wouldn't say this is so much of an F.U. as it was an almost F.U.

30:12.700 --> 30:15.700
because this was really the only thing that got me at all frustrated this week

30:15.700 --> 30:19.700
is on my way here, I'm driving along in my lane

30:19.700 --> 30:22.700
and some guy in a truck decides that he wants to be in my lane

30:22.700 --> 30:26.460
lane and that he'll conveniently not see me so he's pulling into my lane I'm

30:26.460 --> 30:33.780
beeping like you stay out of my lane I'm driving here and so he ends up I slow

30:33.780 --> 30:38.380
way down you know but I can't really break his his car right behind me so I'm

30:38.380 --> 30:41.860
slowing way down to try to get behind this guy and he ends up just swinging on

30:41.860 --> 30:47.940
in and smack in the side at the front side of my car and I actually had

30:47.940 --> 30:51.820
started to steer away at that point you know so I was all you know you knocked

30:51.820 --> 30:55.380
my window in my rearview mirror just pulled inside rolled down my window popped it back

30:55.380 --> 31:01.900
out and he eventually like you know hours later pulled over you know and I was like

31:01.900 --> 31:06.220
dude you are giving me your registration right now and he gets this look on his face like

31:06.220 --> 31:13.200
oh shit so um because you know anyone who messes with my car gets the wrath of sakura

31:13.200 --> 31:19.580
brought down upon them I love my car just to tell everybody I love my car a whole lot

31:19.580 --> 31:25.740
So I'm looking at the side of the car and there's oil all over the side and I'm like, oh god

31:25.740 --> 31:26.220
Oh god

31:26.220 --> 31:30.940
Oh that says I took out my little hand wipes and start wiping the oil off to see what the damage looks like

31:31.260 --> 31:34.420
There's no damage. My car is fine. I

31:34.940 --> 31:37.100
Go look at his car. His truck is fine

31:37.100 --> 31:43.080
I was like dude, you are so lucky your car's filthy and he's like what I was like put your registration back in your car

31:43.080 --> 31:46.280
I don't need it. You didn't hurt my car your car. So greasy my car slid right off it

31:46.280 --> 31:52.280
And I showed him and he's like, whoa, your car doesn't look like it's damaged at all.

31:52.280 --> 31:54.280
I was like, it's not.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.280
I didn't really care if maybe reverse damage had been done.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.280
He was like, don't worry about it, just go on.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.280
He's like, OK.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.280
But I mean, it was just like, didn't you see me?

32:03.280 --> 32:05.280
He's like, oh, no, no, I didn't.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.280
I was like, did you look in your rear view mirror?

32:07.280 --> 32:15.280
And he actually went, uh, this is my piece of advice.

32:15.280 --> 32:19.280
Look out for Lancers! If you hit one, you die!

32:19.280 --> 32:21.280
End of story.

32:21.280 --> 32:23.280
Especially if it's my Lancer.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.280
I don't really have a whole lot of FUs this week.

32:25.280 --> 32:27.280
I'm really not that angsty about a lot of things.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.280
So I would just say FU to, in general, a lack of sleep.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.280
I could step on your foot for you.

32:32.280 --> 32:34.280
No, thank you. FU, Jamie.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.280
FU right back, Ralph!

32:36.280 --> 32:39.280
I haven't been getting a lot of sleep this week.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.280
So FU did that.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.280
Oh, I know! I got a good one.

32:43.280 --> 32:47.800
FU did the fact that I am traveling to LA next week for my day job

32:47.800 --> 32:51.240
so I'm flying down there and coming back Friday and then

32:51.240 --> 32:55.320
I drive back down on Monday for E3. We'll have a caravan though.

32:55.320 --> 32:58.640
Which I still don't have my confirmation for either. My emails are being ignored

32:58.640 --> 33:02.920
at this point. Isn't that interesting? I still think you should follow my advice.

33:02.920 --> 33:08.560
Maybe I'll have to be reporting from the front door because they won't let me in.

33:08.560 --> 33:12.400
We'll see. However you're in and Matt's in but

33:12.400 --> 33:16.480
me no love for Rob. I see how it is.

33:16.480 --> 33:20.640
We'll give you a taser. Well I'll just have to hack things like my DS

33:20.640 --> 33:24.980
because apparently you can hack your DS like you can make it look like a DS

33:24.980 --> 33:25.480
light.

33:25.480 --> 33:29.360
If that's what you, I mean you can't obviously make the shell of it look like

33:29.360 --> 33:30.400
a DS light but

33:30.400 --> 33:34.280
you can make the screen a lot brighter like a DS light. There is some hacks.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.520
It's a hacked firmware that you can

33:36.520 --> 33:40.840
put out there and get on there and it actually was a story that

33:40.840 --> 33:49.400
originally broke over on the forums over at GBADEV.com so it actually came

33:49.400 --> 33:53.920
originally from a Spanish board is where this came from so kind of interesting

33:53.920 --> 33:57.680
and there's pictures that prove it that show that it got brighter so if you're

33:57.680 --> 34:01.040
interested in that check that out I remember when the afterburner came out

34:01.040 --> 34:06.960
on the GBA I still have I still have mine a GBA with an afterburner I have

34:06.960 --> 34:10.960
I have the afterburner in my GBA, except I loaned my GBA out to a friend who was game-less, sadly.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.960
My GBA is pink.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.960
Mine is virginal white.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.960
I actually own a pink video game system.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.960
That's my one requisite girly thing.

34:19.960 --> 34:20.960
There you go.

34:20.960 --> 34:24.960
By the way, just a quick follow-up, so if you're writing emails right now, you can cut that out.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.960
I did find the quick follow-up there to the EA Spouse story.

34:27.960 --> 34:32.960
There were indeed, those lawsuits were indeed already settled.

34:32.960 --> 34:38.480
It was actually three class-action lawsuits and it was already or they actually weren't settled they

34:39.360 --> 34:44.920
Know they won settlements in three class-action lawsuits the developers did so there it is

34:50.320 --> 34:52.240
All right

34:52.240 --> 34:54.400
Dark Sakura is not going to be reading any mail

34:54.400 --> 34:58.920
But she does have a few words of advice for those you guys that want to send in mail for next week's show

34:58.920 --> 35:06.080
um yeah send more of it you know I understand I've got three weeks worth of

35:06.080 --> 35:10.960
email that's come through that I've replied to as many of them as I could

35:10.960 --> 35:14.120
within the limited scope of my homework beating me over the head with a sledge

35:14.120 --> 35:20.800
hammer but I'm gonna start fresh if you've got I promise I will read emails

35:20.800 --> 35:26.400
next week yeah and also send me good ones also we get a lot of story

35:26.400 --> 35:31.000
suggestions on like Myspace and the emails and I get them in my box too and

35:31.000 --> 35:37.180
trust me we have our pulse on like almost every blog and site out there we

35:37.180 --> 35:40.720
check a ton of them daily and we even get some press releases of our own once

35:40.720 --> 35:44.720
in a while and you know we get really lucky we might break a story not that we

35:44.720 --> 35:49.000
don't appreciate it please understand but also you know we really want to hear

35:49.000 --> 35:52.240
your opinions and your thoughts on things that's what we're really after

35:52.240 --> 36:00.240
Also, make sure that if you have an email address that in any way remotely resembles anything spam,

36:00.240 --> 36:07.240
when you send us an email in the subject line, make sure you put OLR and then your subject.

36:07.240 --> 36:15.240
That way, even if it comes into the spam folder, I at least see that we have OLR in the title and I can check it.

36:15.240 --> 36:20.240
Anything that has a spam thing on it, I instantly delete it.

36:20.240 --> 36:25.240
I'm sorry, I check the email for us at various locations.

36:25.920 --> 36:29.280
I do not want to run the risk of infecting systems

36:29.280 --> 36:30.600
that are not my property.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.360
If I infect my own system, I can fix it.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.800
Maybe you should be doing work at work.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.280
I never said I was at work.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.720
I'm just teasing you.

36:37.720 --> 36:39.800
I'm a good girl and I do my job.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.220
All right, guess what?

36:45.480 --> 36:48.520
Koei has revealed their E3 lineup,

36:48.520 --> 36:54.840
And in that lineup, Guitaro Man Live is coming to the PSP in America, that's going to be shown at E3.

36:54.840 --> 36:55.840
I love Koei.

36:55.840 --> 36:58.520
It's exciting news indeed, don't you think?

36:58.520 --> 36:59.520
I love Koei.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.720
I know, I love him too for that.

37:00.720 --> 37:06.720
Koei is another one of my favorite companies that not many people, you know, think of.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.020
I'm very happy to hear that.

37:08.020 --> 37:11.620
Now if they'll just bring us another KO Flying Squadron, oh yeah, I'll be happy.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.620
Well, I'm trying to remember the other stuff they have coming to E3.

37:13.620 --> 37:16.520
They also announced some other things that are supposed to be coming to E3.

37:16.520 --> 37:18.520
Dynasty Warriors.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.520
Yeah, they're doing Dynasty Warriors.

37:20.520 --> 37:21.520
Okay.

37:21.520 --> 37:27.520
Alright, well then let's go over now to DarkSakura to talk about how she likes to surf the internet.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.520
You know, sometimes when she's at work.

37:29.520 --> 37:30.520
Not at work.

37:30.520 --> 37:32.520
Sometimes when she's at friends' houses.

37:32.520 --> 37:37.520
And she finds great websites to share with you guys in her Website of the Week.

37:37.520 --> 37:41.520
I actually didn't find this one on my own.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.520
This one was given to us in the middle of my Flash class.

37:44.520 --> 37:51.520
And I figured Flash pisses me off so much. I'm sure we have many other listeners who are just as pissed off by Flash as I am.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.520
It does not, by the way, piss me off as much as Illustrator does.

37:54.520 --> 37:58.520
So, this site is called actionscript.org.

37:58.520 --> 38:05.520
For anyone who has to deal with a lot of in-depth Flash stuff, by now you are familiar with how frustrating working with scripts can be.

38:05.520 --> 38:13.520
Programming in your stop here, play, and then stop on frame, kiss my butt, so this is the perfect site.

38:13.520 --> 38:17.180
perfect site it has not only does it have tutorials on how to set up a lot of

38:17.180 --> 38:21.440
your different flash actions also outlined from beginning to advanced

38:21.440 --> 38:25.760
level it has your actual scripts that you need to make all this stuff work and

38:25.760 --> 38:30.320
working examples some of these are also listed with movie files to go along with

38:30.320 --> 38:35.200
them to show you how to do it cool very cool site not only that it's also

38:35.200 --> 38:42.720
available in I believe Japanese Dutch French Russian and Serbian for anybody

38:42.720 --> 38:48.220
that needs those Serbians. Sometimes you need to read your sights in Serbians. Who knows,

38:48.220 --> 38:52.660
it could be from that area of the world. That's right. You provide a world-class service to

38:52.660 --> 38:59.660
our listeners. Of course I do. Moving on, we've got one last story for you guys tonight,

39:01.420 --> 39:03.900
unless you have any last minute stories. I don't have anything. Do you have any last

39:03.900 --> 39:07.940
minute stories? Nothing video game related, but this is just nerd happy. Ok, what? I found

39:07.940 --> 39:12.660
out that the movie theater at Arden Fair Mall is playing Spaceballs next week.

39:12.660 --> 39:17.180
They do cult movies every Thursday. They're playing Spaceballs. We need

39:17.180 --> 39:20.220
Spaceballs the game. I kind of want to go to that except I'm gonna be out of town

39:20.220 --> 39:25.020
which makes me sad. I'm going to I'm going to Fandango my tickets. I will

39:25.020 --> 39:29.460
dance the Fandango with my credit card. Well we've got one last story for you

39:29.460 --> 39:34.780
guys tonight and it's it's huge I mean this is huge news absolutely big huge

39:34.780 --> 39:39.940
news that just shook the game industry like crazy this week and I mean because

39:39.940 --> 39:43.480
who doesn't love Indiana Jones? I love Indiana Jones. And Indiana Jones is

39:43.480 --> 39:46.680
another one of those movies that was... I know they're actually doing Temple of

39:46.680 --> 39:51.160
Doom. All right well here it is I mean just had people talking this week Lucas

39:51.160 --> 39:59.140
Arts is supposedly going to be showing an Indiana Jones game at E3 2006 and all

39:59.140 --> 40:03.000
that's that's about all we know we know Lucas Arts is doing it and they're

40:03.000 --> 40:05.560
They're supposedly showing it at E3, but there's not a lot.

40:05.560 --> 40:11.160
Now, this would make sense because they're supposedly in Indiana Jones movie, new one

40:11.160 --> 40:12.520
coming on the way too.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.440
Harrison Ford is too old for this stuff.

40:14.440 --> 40:17.560
Yes, but Sean Connery is rumored to be reprising his role, which might be cool.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.560
I love Sean Connery!

40:18.560 --> 40:19.960
I know, who doesn't love Sean Connery?

40:19.960 --> 40:24.400
He could be a quadruple amputee and he would still be hot.

40:24.400 --> 40:25.400
Alright.

40:25.400 --> 40:28.440
Well, I think that's about all the stories this week.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.920
Yeah, I can't think of anything else.

40:29.920 --> 40:34.080
I can't really think of anything else either, so I guess that's it. We're done with the show so

40:35.020 --> 40:38.560
Thanks for tuning in and tuning in to our special show this week really appreciate it

40:38.560 --> 40:42.720
And now it's time to go around and get our final thoughts dark soccer your final thought I

40:43.880 --> 40:45.840
want chocolate

40:45.840 --> 40:52.520
And my final thought is I want pizza. Let's get pizza. I think that's a good idea have chocolate after oh great idea

40:52.520 --> 40:54.520
How about chocolate-covered pizza?

40:54.520 --> 40:56.660
Maybe not all right well

40:56.660 --> 41:00.100
Well I guess that's going to do it for another week of Orange on the Radio.

41:00.100 --> 41:03.860
Thank you so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent radio even on weeks

41:03.860 --> 41:05.700
when we're not fully staffed.

41:05.700 --> 41:06.700
Really appreciate it.

41:06.700 --> 41:07.700
We love you guys!

41:07.700 --> 41:12.940
Don't forget to check out our big preview show next week for E3 and don't forget to

41:12.940 --> 41:15.740
come by the E3 Outpost and check that out as well.

41:15.740 --> 41:18.340
Remember, chocolate and a dollar.

41:18.340 --> 41:19.340
Oh!

41:19.340 --> 41:25.580
By the way, I forgot, Nintendo renamed their revolution to the Wii.

41:25.580 --> 41:27.580
See you next week!

41:55.580 --> 41:57.580
Weeeeeeeeee!

41:57.580 --> 41:59.580
Weeeeeeeeeeeee!

41:59.580 --> 42:01.580
Okay, look.

42:01.580 --> 42:03.580
We thought it might be a little fun because

42:03.580 --> 42:05.580
we know that all the other game podcasts that you

42:05.580 --> 42:07.580
listen to are probably gonna talk and talk

42:07.580 --> 42:09.580
and talk and talk about the Wii thing this week.

42:09.580 --> 42:11.580
So we thought it might be fun to

42:11.580 --> 42:13.580
you know, avoid the pink elephant in the room

42:13.580 --> 42:15.580
for a little while, but

42:15.580 --> 42:17.580
how can we forget that Nintendo

42:17.580 --> 42:19.580
has renamed the revolution to

42:19.580 --> 42:21.580
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

42:21.580 --> 42:23.580
I don't need to say much more

42:23.580 --> 42:27.740
more about it okay you read about it on every freaking gaming site out there

42:27.740 --> 42:28.740
you've heard about it

42:28.740 --> 42:32.180
all your friends are probably been bitching about it I know seriously with

42:32.180 --> 42:37.180
the internet is bitching about you want to know what what I don't care what they

42:37.180 --> 42:39.220
name it as long as I get my Zelda crack

42:39.220 --> 42:43.220
exactly can in fact can I read a passage from my life journal that would explain

42:43.220 --> 42:46.660
exactly how I feel I really should have posted this avoid the email part

42:46.660 --> 42:50.980
I should have been remember the live journalist for email all of live

42:50.980 --> 42:55.800
Journal is emo. And MySpace is where the internet goes to die. Oh, but we have a MySpace, so

42:55.800 --> 42:58.520
don't forget to add us over there. Yeah, but we don't die there, we just sort of work like

42:58.520 --> 43:02.160
zombies. Alright, look, I'm gonna read a little passage from my Live Journal that I think

43:02.160 --> 43:08.420
explains exactly how I feel about this whole thing. Remember that's WII we, and I didn't

43:08.420 --> 43:14.420
cross post this to the Stuff Blog because I'm lazy. Here it is. Dear gaming community,

43:14.420 --> 43:19.280
they could have called it the Nintendo Poopmonger, and as long as there's a sexy Zelda game on

43:19.280 --> 43:25.320
it or an innovative Mario title or some kwaii animal crossing game or hopefully a new innovative

43:25.320 --> 43:28.520
franchise, y'all will be anxious to play it.

43:28.520 --> 43:33.360
Remember Nintendo is not after your business so much this time and while yes I agree they

43:33.360 --> 43:38.400
need it to be successful, remember the fact stated above that you'll play a good game

43:38.400 --> 43:41.200
regardless of the name of the system it's on.

43:41.200 --> 43:45.960
This whole Wii thing is highly symbolic of the push Nintendo is trying to make to break

43:45.960 --> 43:49.360
the gamer stereotypes and get this thing playable by anyone.

43:49.360 --> 43:53.180
It's a weird name but honestly you had to expect something like this from

43:53.180 --> 43:54.080
Nintendo.

43:54.080 --> 43:57.120
Let's wait and see how good the games are. P.S.

43:57.120 --> 44:01.800
while you yes you can say we is stupid because come play with my we we haha

44:01.800 --> 44:05.560
it's just as easy to make fun of a sex box or a gay stations.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.880
Potty brains can ruin anything trust me I know.

44:08.880 --> 44:13.720
You know what when I first saw it though and if there hadn't been a pronunciation

44:13.720 --> 44:15.320
guide with it I was thinking

44:15.320 --> 44:20.880
Well, maybe they... Why? I was thinking why, because that actually would make sense in my head.

44:20.880 --> 44:24.880
Because why is like yay in Japanese.

44:24.880 --> 44:28.520
W-A-I. I thought that if they were going to spell it, it would be why.

44:28.520 --> 44:33.200
But we... I'd be like, it's cute! It's why!

44:33.200 --> 44:36.720
You know, I get what they're doing. I don't hate the name so much.

44:36.720 --> 44:42.320
We had the Pico, remember? But that was for kids. It's weird, yeah, but Nintendo isn't...

44:42.320 --> 44:48.320
Nintendo's trying to reach a broad audience. They want that buzzword, that easy word this time,

44:48.320 --> 44:51.320
because they're not trying to reach just gamers. They want everybody.

44:51.320 --> 44:54.320
They want Oprah to come out and talk about her Wii.

44:54.320 --> 44:58.320
Wii! I've been calling it the Nintendo Wii!

44:58.320 --> 45:02.320
And all those potty jokes and things, Nintendo I think hopes to transcend that.

45:02.320 --> 45:07.320
If they can get the name Wii out there, then I'm going to go home and play with my Wii

45:07.320 --> 45:10.320
is not going to have the same connotation that it does today.

45:10.320 --> 45:13.680
Nintendo can get over that, then they've been truly successful. If they can't, they're doomed.

45:13.680 --> 45:16.880
We've actually been having a bit of discussion about this on one of the moderator boards

45:16.880 --> 45:24.600
I'm on, about how... it's just been back and forth, like, we've all decided, though, that

45:24.600 --> 45:29.280
they had to have been on heroin when they came up with the name.

45:29.280 --> 45:33.460
I don't think so. It seems like something to me, and I'm speculating here, it seems

45:33.460 --> 45:37.820
like something that kind of Nintendo Japan probably came up with, and once they kind

45:37.820 --> 45:41.560
of gave their reasons, America was like, okay, we can do that.

45:41.560 --> 45:45.660
And I realized, everybody's like, why didn't you just keep the revolution?

45:45.660 --> 45:48.520
Why didn't you just keep the revolution?

45:48.520 --> 45:53.380
Do you know how difficult that might be to pronounce for some people outside the US?

45:53.380 --> 46:00.200
You might as well call it the Nintendo prel, some of you guys will get that joke, but I

46:00.200 --> 46:03.180
think they wanted something very simplistic.

46:03.180 --> 46:07.300
That's the whole thing they're going for, and revolution also has a negative context

46:07.300 --> 46:11.860
in some places, take the game Dance Dance Revolution, they don't call it that in Europe

46:11.860 --> 46:15.440
because of the term Revolution, I don't know, somebody gets offended by it.

46:15.440 --> 46:18.220
They call it Dancing Stage, which is a completely different name.

46:18.220 --> 46:21.500
So I think Revolution wouldn't have worked worldwide.

46:21.500 --> 46:24.940
And I don't think there's been a console that's changed their name from country to country

46:24.940 --> 46:25.940
in a while.

46:25.940 --> 46:32.340
I mean, yes, we had Famicom, NES, Mega Drive, Genesis, but in the past few years, ever since

46:32.340 --> 46:36.140
the PlayStation era, it hasn't really been called different names in different countries.

46:36.140 --> 46:41.500
always been the same. So I just think Revolution, while it might be appropriate of what Nintendo's

46:41.500 --> 46:44.380
going after, I don't think it was an appropriate name for a console. I don't think it would have

46:44.380 --> 46:50.780
worked. So we all knew something different was coming. I think Wii was just a little bit surprising

46:50.780 --> 46:57.100
to some people. But let Nintendo put their money where their mouth is, let's see some of the games,

46:57.100 --> 47:01.740
and that's really what it's all about, right? Who cares what the system is called? It doesn't matter.

47:01.740 --> 47:06.700
remember we had the Pico we had a system named after food I mean if you're

47:06.700 --> 47:11.100
seriously not gonna buy this because you don't want a Wii in your house I don't

47:11.100 --> 47:14.180
mind having a Wii in my house then Nintendo would that make the following

47:14.180 --> 47:17.900
suggestions to you and it based on a recent rebuttal argument that was made

47:17.900 --> 47:22.740
on some websites out there don't fly Virgin Atlantic don't drink naked juice

47:22.740 --> 47:29.580
don't go to Yahoo or Google because those are all silly names too so I think

47:29.580 --> 47:36.920
In the world of advertising, being that that's part of what I am in school, you have to do

47:36.920 --> 47:43.740
something that's going to be easily memorable, something that people are going to talk about

47:43.740 --> 47:45.700
and is immediately catching.

47:45.700 --> 47:50.100
Well, we've got all three of that already.

47:50.100 --> 47:51.280
How can you forget we?

47:51.280 --> 47:55.100
And then everybody is talking about it because it's like, oh my god, weee!

47:55.100 --> 47:56.100
Seriously?

47:56.100 --> 47:59.140
And then, on top of that, it's easy.

47:59.140 --> 48:03.100
there it's we so Nintendo did a very

48:03.100 --> 48:05.700
risky ballsy thing with this and I'm not

48:05.700 --> 48:08.980
trying to say that oh I'm not I may be a

48:08.980 --> 48:10.620
little bit of a Nintendo fanboy but I'm

48:10.620 --> 48:12.180
just a gaming fanboy I like all the

48:12.180 --> 48:14.700
systems and you know I think Nintendo's

48:14.700 --> 48:16.540
just taking a big risk with this I think

48:16.540 --> 48:18.300
it's a it's an interesting choice but

48:18.300 --> 48:21.220
it's a risky choice and they're taking a

48:21.220 --> 48:23.540
big risk with this but nobody said that

48:23.540 --> 48:25.420
this next-gen console war is gonna be an

48:25.420 --> 48:27.180
easy fight right they can change their

48:27.180 --> 48:30.540
mine too. I don't think they will. I know the internet is convinced there's been

48:30.540 --> 48:31.300
stories that

48:31.300 --> 48:35.620
well the Wii's not trademarked so it's not the real name and all this other

48:35.620 --> 48:39.820
conspiracy theories. Guys, I don't really see that happening.

48:39.820 --> 48:43.980
It's the name of the console so enjoy it. Although I do have to say that I think

48:43.980 --> 48:46.280
Sony has really had the best idea overall

48:46.280 --> 48:49.980
with keeping a single name and just adding a number.

48:49.980 --> 48:53.500
But you know what?

48:53.500 --> 48:56.820
If I'm in Nintendo shoes I can say that...

48:56.820 --> 48:59.920
it's the same thing, it's the same old thing, it's just another fricking game

48:59.920 --> 49:01.160
thing, it's another game system.

49:01.160 --> 49:04.560
Nintendo doesn't want that this time. Nintendo wants something

49:04.560 --> 49:07.780
bigger than your typical game system.

49:07.780 --> 49:10.700
But, in the end? It's a game system. True.

49:10.700 --> 49:15.580
You're not gonna escape the fact that they are still marketing games.

49:15.580 --> 49:19.300
They're not trying to market to non-gamers, they're

49:19.300 --> 49:20.380
trying to make non-gamers

49:20.380 --> 49:24.860
into gamers. And so they're trying to convert the masses.

49:24.860 --> 49:28.500
Just remember as you post to message forums you're

49:28.500 --> 49:31.720
angst about how much you hate the name Wii. Please remember

49:31.720 --> 49:36.660
the golden rule of gaming. It's not the system, it's the games that are on it.

49:36.660 --> 49:40.060
Right, the system is only as good as the games that are on it. So

49:40.060 --> 49:45.260
you know what? If there's good games on this you'll be proud to be a Wii owner.

49:45.260 --> 49:48.780
But in the meantime... Some people have always wanted a Wii.

49:48.780 --> 49:55.200
But in the meantime, oh my god, and now for the real outro

49:58.140 --> 50:03.820
