00:13.396 --> 00:14.076
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio

00:37.691 --> 00:38.271
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

01:06.072 --> 01:06.492
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week?

01:06.752 --> 01:07.153
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week.

01:07.273 --> 01:10.094
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally couldn't move, so I had to give blood.

01:10.635 --> 01:13.676
[SPEAKER_05]: But you made quite the turnaround because you were out rocking out last night, right?

01:15.838 --> 01:20.160
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I started feeling better by Monday, and then Tuesday I felt a lot better, and Wednesday I was back at work.

01:21.441 --> 01:24.482
[SPEAKER_00]: I even did my show on Tuesday, even though I said I wasn't going to.

01:24.723 --> 01:28.645
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear me joking in the last podcast that you were playing hooky so you could stay home and play Kingdom Hearts 2?

01:30.383 --> 01:31.224
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not far off.

01:31.524 --> 01:32.104
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.

01:32.365 --> 01:34.927
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did play a whole lot of Kingdom Hearts.

01:45.997 --> 01:48.158
[SPEAKER_01]: People in the chatroom are saying I sound all stuffed up.

01:49.158 --> 01:52.460
[SPEAKER_01]: That's slightly true because you know it is springtime and I have allergies.

01:53.000 --> 02:00.683
[SPEAKER_01]: But when in fact I was actually up until 4.30am because I went to see the most amazing live band ever.

02:01.563 --> 02:02.044
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was?

02:02.144 --> 02:02.744
[SPEAKER_01]: Babyland.

02:02.904 --> 02:04.625
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally get to see Babyland live.

02:04.685 --> 02:05.445
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so happy.

02:05.765 --> 02:09.887
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all the other bands were like Suck, Suck, More Suck, and then the Mormons.

02:10.834 --> 02:11.935
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss Ninja Academy.

02:11.955 --> 02:12.876
[SPEAKER_01]: 8-Bit was cool.

02:13.696 --> 02:20.501
[SPEAKER_01]: We went outside for, because I went with a guano girl and she went to go have a smoke and we were outside.

02:21.462 --> 02:30.649
[SPEAKER_01]: While we were outside, this is video game related by the way, I hear this bass line because they're sort of like kind of weird rap, you know, group, but they're wearing hazmat suits too.

02:31.209 --> 02:37.314
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hear this bass line that sounds familiar and it turns out that it's the Zelda music as a bass line.

02:38.621 --> 02:39.001
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

02:39.422 --> 02:40.142
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.

02:40.262 --> 02:43.365
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I wouldn't listen to 8-Bit all the time, but their music was pretty cool.

02:43.485 --> 02:44.806
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we should get them on the show at some point.

02:45.226 --> 02:45.526
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

02:45.987 --> 02:48.148
[SPEAKER_01]: But Babyland owned the stage.

02:48.349 --> 02:49.990
[SPEAKER_01]: I was bouncing and jumping.

02:51.191 --> 02:52.011
[SPEAKER_01]: We get out of there at like 1.30.

02:52.272 --> 02:55.674
[SPEAKER_01]: I get home at 3.30 and, you know, of course I date my live journal.

02:57.896 --> 02:58.657
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a true addict.

02:58.757 --> 02:59.437
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a true addict.

02:59.517 --> 03:00.218
[SPEAKER_01]: I have photos.

03:00.298 --> 03:02.780
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be sharing photos with our chat room tonight.

03:03.681 --> 03:04.121
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um...

03:05.086 --> 03:06.287
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:36.297 --> 03:37.458
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP Silent Hill

04:03.953 --> 04:04.473
[SPEAKER_05]: How about that?

04:05.735 --> 04:10.559
[SPEAKER_05]: The source is self-styled online radio station Orange Lounge Radio.

04:12.401 --> 04:13.221
[SPEAKER_05]: Never heard of that.

04:13.242 --> 04:14.282
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about that.

04:14.343 --> 04:15.323
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of no-names over there.

04:15.984 --> 04:17.145
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, the official story.

04:17.485 --> 04:20.868
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently Konami reps had not returned requests for comment on this.

04:21.009 --> 04:23.551
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, sounds pretty interesting.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.413
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm calling April Fool's.

04:25.453 --> 04:27.575
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally think they're lying.

04:28.564 --> 04:30.064
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

04:53.348 --> 05:01.391
[SPEAKER_05]: People took notice this week when it crowed that it had uncovered a slew of unannounced games and ship dates courtesy of a leaked list Konami had sent to retailers.

05:09.238 --> 05:11.781
[SPEAKER_03]: They basically send it to anybody who sells games.

05:12.001 --> 05:14.103
[SPEAKER_03]: We probably get some sort of information like this.

05:14.244 --> 05:14.824
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

05:15.865 --> 05:16.827
[SPEAKER_05]: And blah, blah, blah.

05:16.867 --> 05:20.231
[SPEAKER_05]: They talk about the titles that this website decided to announce.

05:20.491 --> 05:23.715
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Supernova is going to happen on September 13th.

05:24.055 --> 05:27.019
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Dance Revolution Universe on October 11th.

05:27.079 --> 05:28.540
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Ultramix 4 on November 14th.

05:29.501 --> 05:32.523
[SPEAKER_05]: Castlevania, Portrait of Ruin on November 15th.

05:32.563 --> 05:34.145
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, that's Portrait, not Portal.

05:34.345 --> 05:34.705
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, guys.

05:34.965 --> 05:37.087
[SPEAKER_05]: Portrait of Ruin.

05:37.907 --> 05:42.350
[SPEAKER_05]: And then PSP, Silent Hill, Original Sin on October 18th.

05:42.891 --> 05:49.996
[SPEAKER_05]: Although very interesting, because I seem to recall this website had a giant disclaimer that said all these dates are subject to change, as release dates always do.

05:50.576 --> 05:50.696
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

05:50.997 --> 05:51.197
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

05:51.277 --> 05:51.837
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, whatever.

05:51.857 --> 05:52.498
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

05:53.243 --> 05:57.765
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, and then of course two new Death Junior games, but people don't seem to care as much about those.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.426
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I thought this was interesting too.

06:00.726 --> 06:04.928
[SPEAKER_05]: This list also promises a potentially very lucrative tie-in for Konami.

06:05.388 --> 06:10.890
[SPEAKER_05]: According to Orange Lounge Radio, the list has Karaoke Revolution American Idol arriving in stores on November 15th.

06:11.310 --> 06:17.933
[SPEAKER_05]: If true, the game would be the second one based on the mega popular television series after Codemasters dismally reviewed 2003 game.

06:19.213 --> 06:24.556
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind that Konami already announced back in October that they were going to do the American Idol franchise.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.777
[SPEAKER_05]: I know because we covered it on this program.

06:27.017 --> 06:28.838
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it still is a rumor.

06:28.878 --> 06:30.259
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dirty rumor at this point.

06:30.839 --> 06:32.340
[SPEAKER_03]: Who actually listens to us?

06:32.460 --> 06:32.900
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot.

06:33.440 --> 06:34.641
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody knows of Orange Launch Radio.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.362
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been low-key for the past few years.

06:36.702 --> 06:36.942
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

06:37.933 --> 06:38.494
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio

06:59.301 --> 07:02.308
[SPEAKER_05]: But somehow, that whole time, we've managed to be Loki.

07:02.348 --> 07:05.816
[SPEAKER_05]: So our longtime fans, you know, you've been a part of something for a long time.

07:05.836 --> 07:06.959
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always been Loki.

07:06.979 --> 07:07.961
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you've always been Loki.

07:09.076 --> 07:09.636
[SPEAKER_01]: No, shut up.

07:33.732 --> 07:36.794
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Castlevania was such a kickass game on the DS.

07:37.134 --> 07:39.156
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course there was going to be another DS game coming.

07:39.556 --> 07:41.858
[SPEAKER_05]: The Silent Hill remake has been running around.

07:41.878 --> 07:42.738
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a rumor.

07:43.359 --> 07:44.780
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered that, what, three weeks ago?

07:44.800 --> 07:53.626
[SPEAKER_03]: They talked about, well, they were going to make, other than the Silent Hill experience, they were going to be doing a PSP game anyway, so it's like, okay.

07:53.646 --> 08:00.510
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a speculation given from some other commentary about them remaking based on the movie.

08:01.411 --> 08:02.752
[SPEAKER_01]: Remaking the first game based on the movie.

08:03.235 --> 08:06.337
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, DDR is going to have home releases this year.

08:06.357 --> 08:08.057
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're not going to release it at home.

08:08.198 --> 08:08.698
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

08:08.838 --> 08:15.381
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind the fact that when they were advertising Supernova, they said that it's going to have some connectivity to home versions.

08:16.902 --> 08:19.383
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously, there's got to be a new home version coming out.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.064
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

08:21.124 --> 08:22.885
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we really deserve all this notoriety?

08:22.945 --> 08:25.266
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do people care so much about this story?

08:25.886 --> 08:27.407
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people like release dates.

08:28.367 --> 08:29.768
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we beat them to it.

08:29.928 --> 08:31.649
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though release dates are always subject to change.

08:32.208 --> 08:32.609
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

08:32.669 --> 08:33.811
[SPEAKER_03]: They're always subject to change.

08:33.891 --> 08:42.423
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, by the time we get down to it, well, you know, to be honest, the DDR releases, I'm not too surprised on because they release DDR about the same time every year.

08:42.824 --> 08:47.631
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you get the Xbox version, you know, sometime in November, you know, usually the first half.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.628
[SPEAKER_03]: and the PS2 version sometime in September.

08:51.149 --> 08:52.650
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the same time every year.

08:53.151 --> 08:56.193
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I found the whole fallout over this story very fascinating.

08:56.253 --> 09:03.220
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the part that fascinated me most wasn't the notoriety itself, because I understand people care about Silent Hill and Castlevania and DDR.

09:03.660 --> 09:06.242
[SPEAKER_05]: All three of them have very rabid fan bases, but what surprised me

09:07.023 --> 09:09.726
[SPEAKER_05]: was the reaction on the internet out there to these stories.

09:10.146 --> 09:15.852
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really funny because when DDR Freak, Bomani Style, those sites picked up the story, it was reported as fact.

09:16.492 --> 09:23.699
[SPEAKER_05]: But when other sites, bigger name sites, picked this up, it was reported as rumor, which I thought was very, very interesting.

09:23.739 --> 09:24.680
[SPEAKER_05]: And you bring up a good point.

09:24.861 --> 09:26.522
[SPEAKER_05]: Are people just upset that we beat them to it?

09:27.743 --> 09:28.104
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

09:29.733 --> 09:31.594
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, remind us, Loki, where did this come from?

09:31.674 --> 09:33.454
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a list that goes out?

09:33.594 --> 09:40.496
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this information got sent to our buyer, the person that maintains our item database.

09:40.976 --> 09:44.657
[SPEAKER_03]: This was sent to us and entered into our item database.

09:45.178 --> 09:49.219
[SPEAKER_03]: I merely get a report every now and then when they change dates.

09:49.579 --> 09:53.200
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a date change report, and I notice Bomberman Act 0.

09:54.008 --> 09:54.528
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360, PSP

10:19.025 --> 10:19.425
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura,

10:42.361 --> 10:53.168
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, release dates to me are not really a big deal, but I just thought it was interesting because there's a lot of these games that we knew were coming out anyways, and now that we had dates, it's kind of making them more official.

10:53.348 --> 10:56.510
[SPEAKER_03]: Also kind of gives you an idea of what they're going to be showing at E3 this year.

10:56.551 --> 10:56.931
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, hold on.

10:57.011 --> 10:58.492
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought you were going to say some more stuff.

10:58.892 --> 10:59.893
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold that thought for a minute, though.

10:59.993 --> 11:00.113
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

11:00.213 --> 11:11.941
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, okay, here's the interesting thing, because what I thought was interesting about the reaction is that people didn't believe it when it was on our site, but when somebody else, one of the big name sites reported it, then,

11:12.401 --> 11:13.884
[SPEAKER_05]: It was validated.

11:14.124 --> 11:14.745
[SPEAKER_05]: It was true.

11:15.686 --> 11:16.387
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what, guys?

11:16.928 --> 11:20.494
[SPEAKER_05]: Those big sites all copied from our list.

11:21.575 --> 11:22.557
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the proof.

11:23.237 --> 11:30.961
[SPEAKER_05]: The proof is, is that when these websites ran a story that said Konami leaked information or whatever, they listed the same dates we did.

11:31.502 --> 11:36.464
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we didn't tell you was, Loki only posted the games he thought you'd want to know about, right?

11:36.604 --> 11:37.065
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

11:37.305 --> 11:42.648
[SPEAKER_05]: So a website that would have found this about Konami games would have picked up the other

11:43.308 --> 11:49.855
[SPEAKER_05]: Lower name titles that maybe we didn't think you originally wanted to know about, but now, after all this fear, we guess you do want to know about.

11:50.275 --> 11:50.436
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

11:50.716 --> 11:54.160
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki, what are some other Konami games that were on this list?

11:55.141 --> 11:56.742
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, Rengoku 2.

11:57.603 --> 12:00.766
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's really sad is I actually played Rengoku last E3.

12:01.567 --> 12:05.992
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually brought it with me on my PSP, and I love this game, except it was really boring.

12:06.550 --> 12:09.932
[SPEAKER_03]: But for whatever reason, Rengoku 2 is coming out in July 12th.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.612
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's slated for right now.

12:11.672 --> 12:16.074
[SPEAKER_03]: About the same time I... No, actually, I think Rengoku came out later than that last year.

12:16.114 --> 12:19.176
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, yeah, okay game, I guess.

12:20.657 --> 12:21.857
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddamn screensaver.

12:22.798 --> 12:24.959
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking hate these stupid... That's why you turned them off.

12:25.919 --> 12:26.860
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like the fishies.

12:27.100 --> 12:31.982
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, on top of that, we've also got... Let's see here.

12:32.458 --> 12:33.179
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a Yu-Gi-Oh!

12:33.219 --> 12:34.800
[SPEAKER_03]: fan, there's going to be lots of stuff for you.

12:34.860 --> 12:35.640
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got Yu-Gi-Oh!

12:35.940 --> 12:38.462
[SPEAKER_03]: GX Tag Force coming out on the PSP.

12:38.562 --> 12:39.903
[SPEAKER_03]: That's in November 15th.

12:41.164 --> 12:46.508
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaolin Showdown, which is apparently based on some anime show that's, I think, on the WB or whatever.

12:47.108 --> 12:54.173
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, PSP, and I think DS.

12:55.073 --> 12:57.195
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one's coming out on November 15th.

12:59.776 --> 13:01.817
[SPEAKER_03]: Online Chess Kingdoms PSP.

13:02.457 --> 13:03.857
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so looking forward to that.

13:04.877 --> 13:06.178
[SPEAKER_03]: Also November 15th.

13:07.778 --> 13:08.038
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerd.

13:08.318 --> 13:11.219
[SPEAKER_03]: Winx Club Quest for Codex.

13:11.659 --> 13:12.119
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, the Winx.

13:12.299 --> 13:14.340
[SPEAKER_05]: That was last year's E3 for me.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.520
[SPEAKER_05]: Standing in Konami's booth jamming to that Winx song.

13:16.580 --> 13:18.481
[SPEAKER_01]: That you know that song frightens me.

13:20.341 --> 13:23.282
[SPEAKER_05]: It's stuck in my head from last year's E3 being at that booth.

13:23.322 --> 13:24.342
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an infectious song.

13:24.382 --> 13:24.942
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't mess with me.

13:25.382 --> 13:27.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Well anyways, Winx Club Quest for Codex.

13:29.175 --> 13:36.919
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be coming out, looks like, October 25th, along with Steel Horizon on the PSP, which I believe is a naval warfare game.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.601
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's a Marvel trading card game, to be honest.

13:40.621 --> 13:41.362
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this all Konami?

13:41.522 --> 13:42.402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all Konami.

13:42.623 --> 13:47.125
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvel trading card games coming out on the PSP, and I want to say the DS.

13:48.386 --> 13:49.326
[SPEAKER_03]: So that should be interesting.

13:49.346 --> 13:52.528
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they're trying to, you know, I guess since Yu-Gi-Oh!

13:52.568 --> 13:54.109
[SPEAKER_03]: is popular, they're trying some other stuff here.

13:55.930 --> 13:57.591
[SPEAKER_03]: And... I want to say, I think

13:58.568 --> 14:02.493
[SPEAKER_03]: Gradius Collections coming out next month, June 14th, but I knew that for a while.

14:03.113 --> 14:06.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Demon Chaos coming out next month.

14:08.699 --> 14:12.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Lunar Knights Vampire Hunt is going to be coming out November 15th.

14:12.844 --> 14:13.164
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

14:14.543 --> 14:16.044
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that's about it.

14:16.304 --> 14:18.026
[SPEAKER_00]: Wake me up when we get a Goemon game.

14:18.666 --> 14:26.412
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what I think is interesting about this is that, you know, and if Konami, anybody from Konami is listening and is ticked off about this, please don't be.

14:26.752 --> 14:33.958
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just repeating information that's already been put out there into the retailers and we figure, well, since retailers know about this, you know, maybe the gamers want to know about this too.

14:34.838 --> 14:39.522
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's the same thing like when other websites post a goddamn list from GameStop.

14:39.702 --> 14:41.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are internalists that they actually...

14:42.241 --> 14:50.625
[SPEAKER_05]: And to lessen the blow a little bit, do you have anything from another game company that people might want to know about?

14:50.705 --> 14:51.386
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah, we do.

14:52.706 --> 14:53.246
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, no.

14:54.447 --> 14:57.048
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a look-see here, some stuff maybe later on this year.

14:57.328 --> 15:00.510
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for example, this is not in any order.

15:01.210 --> 15:07.073
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, for example, there was some games, actually they announced open season, I think, this week as well.

15:07.894 --> 15:11.237
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of the ones that's going to be based on, I think, a DreamWorks movie or something like that.

15:11.257 --> 15:14.740
[SPEAKER_03]: Some animated movie about animals getting back at hunters or something.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.742
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's coming out in the fall.

15:19.063 --> 15:20.144
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have, what was it?

15:20.244 --> 15:22.866
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what was a really cool one here?

15:24.367 --> 15:24.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here's one.

15:26.889 --> 15:30.272
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo DS, SNK vs. Capcom Cardfighter.

15:30.392 --> 15:34.075
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming out on, looks like, October 2nd.

15:34.375 --> 15:35.156
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that's awesome.

15:36.562 --> 15:37.643
[SPEAKER_01]: Cartoon Network Racing

16:03.204 --> 16:04.224
[SPEAKER_03]: October 18th.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.684
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, there's Dance Factory.

16:05.724 --> 16:07.545
[SPEAKER_05]: That game's been delayed forever.

16:07.645 --> 16:09.345
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it sucked.

16:09.485 --> 16:10.865
[SPEAKER_05]: A game based on the movie Cars?

16:10.945 --> 16:12.586
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what that is on June 7th there?

16:13.106 --> 16:15.306
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's... Oh, what was that?

16:15.366 --> 16:15.846
[SPEAKER_05]: Naruto.

16:15.886 --> 16:18.187
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet a lot of our listeners that like anime want to know about that.

16:18.407 --> 16:22.247
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually are bringing out the... I've known about this for a little while.

16:22.267 --> 16:24.228
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bringing out one of the last Naruto games.

16:24.828 --> 16:26.428
[SPEAKER_03]: Naruto Ultimate Ninja.

16:26.448 --> 16:27.688
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out June 21st.

16:29.209 --> 16:31.389
[SPEAKER_03]: What was a really funny one I saw here?

16:32.335 --> 16:33.756
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that people might not know about yet?

16:34.116 --> 16:36.837
[SPEAKER_03]: PS2, Yakuza, it's coming out September 13th.

16:37.117 --> 16:38.737
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that was one that was pretty cool.

16:39.638 --> 16:42.259
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of some really cool stuff.

16:42.599 --> 16:44.159
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's coming out way later in the year there.

16:45.660 --> 16:47.261
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish this was in order here.

16:47.541 --> 16:49.161
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's a bunch of 360 games.

16:50.002 --> 16:52.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Rising, I think the date's wrong on that, though.

16:52.863 --> 16:53.963
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it got postponed.

16:54.003 --> 16:55.104
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't updated it yet.

16:57.344 --> 16:58.745
[SPEAKER_03]: Overgy Fighters, that looks kind of cool.

16:59.767 --> 17:01.848
[SPEAKER_05]: Nova G Fighters is June 8th there?

17:02.088 --> 17:02.808
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, June 8th.

17:04.008 --> 17:05.248
[SPEAKER_03]: Splinter Cell, Double Agent?

17:05.569 --> 17:06.229
[SPEAKER_03]: That's September.

17:06.809 --> 17:10.630
[SPEAKER_03]: They got postponed a while back because they didn't think there was enough systems out there.

17:11.510 --> 17:13.451
[SPEAKER_03]: Snoopy vs. the Red Baron, August 16th.

17:13.471 --> 17:15.491
[SPEAKER_03]: We covered that one.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

17:19.952 --> 17:21.133
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so there you have it.

17:21.553 --> 17:31.360
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, and this is, this stuff is all, you know, subject to change, I mean, a lot of stuff they announce way in advance and gets pushed back and back and back and back and, yeah.

17:32.040 --> 17:35.203
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, I don't know, there's some, some good stuff.

17:35.583 --> 17:42.087
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Mega Man ZX, um, coming out September 13th on the Game Boy Advance.

17:44.109 --> 17:44.409
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

17:46.210 --> 17:47.971
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, lots of exciting stuff.

17:48.492 --> 17:48.592
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

17:49.628 --> 17:51.269
[SPEAKER_03]: More, of course, coming from E3.

17:52.069 --> 17:55.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I mean, we might see stuff at E3 that, you know, wasn't on the Konami list.

17:56.031 --> 17:56.651
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, absolutely.

17:57.051 --> 17:57.711
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there will be.

17:58.031 --> 18:03.374
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for example, we don't have any Revolution or PS3 titles in here yet.

18:03.434 --> 18:05.674
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was nothing on Metal Gear 4, right?

18:05.755 --> 18:09.356
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, we know Konami's planning, but they don't have a date for it yet, obviously.

18:09.376 --> 18:09.796
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.077
[SPEAKER_03]: So, lots of stuff coming.

18:12.777 --> 18:15.979
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'll just keep an eye out on these dates.

18:16.039 --> 18:19.340
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if we see anything good, I'll definitely, you know,

18:19.761 --> 18:21.222
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep guys up to date on this stuff.

18:22.583 --> 18:23.463
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sounds great.

18:24.084 --> 18:27.026
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Skype line is open if anyone wants to give us a call.

18:27.206 --> 18:30.828
[SPEAKER_05]: Most specifically about this topic here is what we want you guys' feedback on.

18:31.088 --> 18:33.510
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about this whole news story?

18:33.590 --> 18:34.771
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think we're full of crap?

18:35.471 --> 18:38.213
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I hope by this point you don't, but if you do, then say so.

18:38.273 --> 18:40.094
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll offer our witty retorts.

18:41.195 --> 18:44.597
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we ruin E3?

18:44.677 --> 18:45.377
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we did.

18:45.417 --> 18:46.838
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we built hype for E3.

18:46.958 --> 18:48.639
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, if anything, this...

18:50.543 --> 18:56.286
[SPEAKER_03]: Who out there, I mean, other than probably us, actually goes to E3 looking to see what Konami's putting out?

18:56.366 --> 19:02.709
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know everybody's interested in all the companies and stuff, but, I mean, the big focus this year is going to be PS3, Revolution.

19:03.110 --> 19:08.793
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the fact that we put out the dates, maybe if anything, kind of helped.

19:09.713 --> 19:10.073
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

19:11.014 --> 19:11.914
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only two weeks away.

19:11.934 --> 19:15.156
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like, you know, it's not a huge spoiler.

19:15.176 --> 19:16.797
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

19:17.870 --> 19:25.096
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so no calls coming in on the Skype line right now, but our chat room is kind of a buzz here over at www.orangelantradio.com.

19:25.116 --> 19:25.716
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on chat.

19:26.377 --> 19:29.099
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Ranma says, Naruto GameCube sucks.

19:29.339 --> 19:34.063
[SPEAKER_05]: Naruto PS2 owns, or I should say pones, so to speak.

19:36.085 --> 19:40.348
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Knight wants to know, oh my God, they're going to port the Neo Geo Pocket game.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.450
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if that's in reference to the Capcom SNK.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.703
[SPEAKER_03]: Naruto 2 is coming out on GameCube October 18th

20:10.353 --> 20:11.616
[SPEAKER_03]: Current Gen stuff as well.

20:11.936 --> 20:15.544
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be ported into PSP, PS2, Xbox.

20:16.826 --> 20:17.187
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

20:19.171 --> 20:20.173
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sounds pretty good.

20:21.457 --> 20:21.937
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

20:22.017 --> 20:31.381
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, since it looks like people are being shy in our chat room right now, not wanting to give us a call, we'll open up Skype line a little later for other topics if you guys want to call in and talk about that.

20:31.401 --> 20:37.024
[SPEAKER_05]: But for now, we'll go ahead and move on and talk about our gaming week, how we usually start off the show.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.105
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week?

20:40.385 --> 20:42.226
[SPEAKER_01]: Kingdom Hearts and lots of it.

20:43.846 --> 20:44.527
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

20:44.567 --> 20:48.829
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played just like I was so in a hurry to get past all the Roxas crap.

20:50.362 --> 20:51.362
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear that's a fun part of the game.

20:51.382 --> 20:52.162
[SPEAKER_01]: What's his face, the guitar boy?

20:52.182 --> 20:53.683
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a pain in the ass to beat.

21:20.257 --> 21:26.823
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing a lot of that, and not really much else, just because it puts me back in couch potato mode.

21:27.704 --> 21:32.449
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a little bit of Ragnarok, but I was like, eh, I don't really feel like trying to get to level 50 today.

21:33.770 --> 21:39.296
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really been about all I've been playing, is lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of Kingdom Hearts.

21:40.156 --> 21:42.579
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I hear it's a very time-consuming game.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.827
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't touched my copy in a week.

22:14.210 --> 22:19.855
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked a different name because I just wanted some anonymity on playing Final Fantasy XI.

22:20.715 --> 22:23.638
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is a Skye on there, but it's a she and it's not me.

22:24.318 --> 22:25.199
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a different name on there.

22:25.239 --> 22:35.627
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've ran into a lot of really nice people on that server and some people that are helping me level my way to level 30 so I can get some of those advanced jobs because I kind of want to be a puppet master in Final Fantasy XI.

22:35.647 --> 22:36.048
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll rock.

22:36.648 --> 22:39.110
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as other games, I've been playing a whole lot of new stuff.

22:39.510 --> 22:42.153
[SPEAKER_05]: I ordered Beatmania 2DX Nightstyle.

22:43.272 --> 22:46.634
[SPEAKER_05]: like last week and I finally got it this week so I've been playing a little bit of that.

22:47.294 --> 23:02.643
[SPEAKER_05]: Beatmania's release here in the USA really got me back into playing that and outside of that I also decided to download Mutant Storm Reloaded, the game on Xbox Live Arcade after seeing it at Loki's house the other day and it's interesting because it's very similar to Geometry Wars but it's not.

23:03.203 --> 23:08.726
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the stages aren't all that same square and it's a pretty game but not in the same way.

23:09.207 --> 23:11.288
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very sci-fi looking and

23:12.068 --> 23:12.989
[SPEAKER_05]: Pulsing Cells

23:32.179 --> 23:33.901
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23:53.340 --> 24:16.330
[SPEAKER_05]: and that pretty much does it for my gaming week I mean Final Fantasy XI eats up a lot of my time I have other games that I'm waiting to try like Spike brought some games that he wanted me to try out and I got a copy of Oblivion but for the computer and I want to be checking that out pretty soon as well so one of my friends is letting me borrow his copy of Oblivion so that'll be good I wanted to add something what's that?

24:17.070 --> 24:18.691
[SPEAKER_01]: I really really hate the Little Mermaid levels

24:19.620 --> 24:21.022
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24:43.615 --> 24:47.457
[SPEAKER_05]: MiniMe283 says, I love that Penny Arcade comic about Kingdom Hearts 2.

24:48.137 --> 24:49.857
[SPEAKER_05]: I unfortunately didn't see that one.

24:49.877 --> 24:50.918
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping maybe you'd seen it.

24:51.138 --> 24:51.938
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have.

24:52.138 --> 24:54.099
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Winnie the Pooh merging with Sephiroth.

24:54.139 --> 24:55.459
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, I did see that.

24:55.920 --> 24:56.800
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I did see that.

24:57.320 --> 24:57.900
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was funny.

25:00.041 --> 25:01.382
[SPEAKER_05]: So Sephiroth's in this one, too?

25:02.402 --> 25:04.783
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and he's not, what's his face anymore?

25:04.963 --> 25:06.363
[SPEAKER_05]: Lance Bass from NSYNC?

25:06.943 --> 25:08.304
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but...

25:09.619 --> 25:11.880
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever is Aerith sounds like she's stoned.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.161
[SPEAKER_05]: Mina Savari from American Beauty.

25:14.821 --> 25:15.581
[SPEAKER_05]: She sucks.

25:15.621 --> 25:16.742
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like her in that.

25:16.802 --> 25:18.302
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's going to be her in Advent Children.

25:18.782 --> 25:20.783
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have rather had Mandy Moore in that saying something.

25:21.864 --> 25:25.365
[SPEAKER_01]: But she's like, oh, I'm on drugs.

25:27.285 --> 25:28.246
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to get high?

25:29.926 --> 25:31.147
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what have you been playing this week?

25:32.047 --> 25:34.928
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've been playing Mutant Storm Reloaded.

25:35.028 --> 25:37.249
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that last night, and that was fun.

25:38.916 --> 25:39.816
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting tangled here.

25:40.377 --> 25:42.997
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was also playing more Oblivion.

25:43.878 --> 25:44.638
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really cool.

25:45.358 --> 25:45.978
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm cheating.

25:46.639 --> 25:47.279
[SPEAKER_03]: That's even better.

25:48.239 --> 25:49.240
[SPEAKER_03]: I did an item dupe.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.121
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have all the uber stuff now.

25:54.061 --> 25:54.822
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of neat though.

25:54.842 --> 26:01.244
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this really magic enhanced katana and I took off someone's head with it and it was cool.

26:02.464 --> 26:06.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Tried to kill a horse and people didn't like that very much.

26:08.891 --> 26:10.212
[SPEAKER_03]: But, what else?

26:10.992 --> 26:18.195
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Rumble Roses XX, and... I've been playing with the photo-taking mode.

26:18.615 --> 26:21.676
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I did create a character, though, and it looked pretty cool.

26:21.996 --> 26:27.399
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get much to start off with, but it's really neat how they do, like, the different... how customizable it is.

26:28.119 --> 26:32.101
[SPEAKER_03]: I did make a character that looked like Miss Swan from Mad TV.

26:32.141 --> 26:34.181
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna say, you were telling me about Miss Swan.

26:34.221 --> 26:35.522
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish you could have seen this.

26:35.982 --> 26:37.003
[SPEAKER_03]: That was hilarious.

26:37.803 --> 26:37.903
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

26:39.562 --> 26:40.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the Ms.

26:40.163 --> 26:47.170
[SPEAKER_03]: Swan character, all you have to do is basically take the default character that they give you and just make her fat and she looks like Ms.

26:47.210 --> 26:47.591
[SPEAKER_03]: Swan.

26:48.432 --> 26:50.394
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

26:50.834 --> 26:52.536
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, what else did I do?

26:52.716 --> 26:56.060
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually... Apparently...

26:56.886 --> 26:58.747
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Mario Kart GP.

26:59.568 --> 27:02.149
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell you anything about it because I don't remember.

27:02.730 --> 27:09.394
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Loki's bachelor party was last night and as part of it he got to go to Golf Land to play some Drunken Miniature Golf and some Drunken Mario Kart.

27:09.434 --> 27:09.894
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there.

27:10.374 --> 27:15.257
[SPEAKER_05]: I filmed it and I think it's going to be going up on the website at some point or maybe the MySpace or something.

27:15.297 --> 27:15.697
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

27:15.978 --> 27:19.700
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to put it somewhere on one of those sites.

27:19.740 --> 27:22.401
[SPEAKER_05]: We still need more people on our MySpace so maybe we ought to put it over there.

27:22.902 --> 27:23.562
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll put it on both.

27:23.622 --> 27:24.463
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it on YouTube.

27:24.603 --> 27:24.723
[SPEAKER_05]: It's

27:26.745 --> 27:31.666
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole... Drunken A-hole from No Name Site plays Mario Kart Drunk.

27:32.827 --> 27:33.567
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

27:33.947 --> 27:39.349
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the best part was, you know how Mario Kart Arcade will take your picture before you start playing?

27:39.629 --> 27:42.929
[SPEAKER_05]: The picture that you did was so friggin' hilarious.

27:42.990 --> 27:43.910
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even describe it.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.210
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are going to have to wait for the video.

27:45.250 --> 27:45.710
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

27:46.851 --> 27:48.631
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm converting the video tonight.

27:49.851 --> 27:52.832
[SPEAKER_05]: JeremyTodd1 says, put it on olrpsp.com.

27:53.132 --> 27:54.793
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, we're definitely going to be doing that.

27:54.973 --> 27:55.633
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

27:56.992 --> 27:59.395
[SPEAKER_05]: The 23rd Magus says, We need a drunk show.

28:00.496 --> 28:03.279
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to tell you, but probably not going to happen for a little while.

28:03.299 --> 28:05.741
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be somewhere during our next three-day weekend.

28:06.442 --> 28:06.722
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

28:07.023 --> 28:07.723
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

28:07.883 --> 28:10.807
[SPEAKER_00]: The next three-day weekend is... Memorial Day weekend at Fonamay.

28:10.927 --> 28:12.288
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're doing the panels at Fonamay.

28:12.308 --> 28:13.509
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'd love to meet some of our listeners.

28:13.730 --> 28:14.851
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and like...

28:15.473 --> 28:18.935
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the last really bad drunk show, I did get very sick.

28:19.235 --> 28:25.980
[SPEAKER_05]: There will probably be some drinking at E3 Outpost, because I know we're supposed to be doing that with the folks over at AllGames.com.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.843
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got the little E3Outpost.com, and they're supposed to have a bar, so that might be a good time.

28:31.063 --> 28:32.684
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me a happy bunny.

28:33.545 --> 28:33.965
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

28:34.785 --> 28:37.567
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing is... I don't know.

28:38.668 --> 28:39.909
[SPEAKER_03]: Last night was pretty bad.

28:40.149 --> 28:40.369
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

28:41.627 --> 28:42.467
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really bad.

28:42.487 --> 28:44.728
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your bachelor party?

28:45.528 --> 28:46.909
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember half of it.

28:47.369 --> 28:49.369
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's supposed to happen.

28:49.749 --> 28:55.671
[SPEAKER_03]: But, luckily, even though I can't remember it, we do have it on video.

28:55.711 --> 29:00.412
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to put the Mario Kart thing because I watched that today for the first time and I laughed my ass off.

29:00.452 --> 29:01.693
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was hilarious.

29:02.013 --> 29:03.833
[SPEAKER_03]: The face that it made was great.

29:05.474 --> 29:06.334
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're so funny.

29:07.134 --> 29:07.354
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

29:08.215 --> 29:09.055
[SPEAKER_03]: I was yelling at

29:09.551 --> 29:11.632
[SPEAKER_03]: The Volcano, because I could.

29:13.493 --> 29:19.397
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Milfululi says, and I totally butchered that name, sorry, says that we should put it on WikiQuote.

29:20.037 --> 29:23.319
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I think Matt's WikiQuote got VFD'd today.

29:23.619 --> 29:27.561
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's there anymore, so sadness, but no more WikiQuote for us.

29:27.981 --> 29:32.064
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if somebody wanted to create one under Orange Lounge Radio, they might be able to get away with it this time.

29:32.104 --> 29:32.404
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

29:32.444 --> 29:32.744
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

29:34.888 --> 29:39.771
[SPEAKER_05]: We're too busy converting videos or ourselves on wiki, but we know you guys love the wiki.

29:40.011 --> 29:44.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, of course, I did play more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories.

29:45.713 --> 29:46.114
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.

29:46.774 --> 29:47.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

29:47.834 --> 29:53.057
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get into some news from a bunch of no-name websites out there that we want to share with you guys.

29:53.077 --> 29:53.617
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

29:54.198 --> 29:54.799
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm totally kidding.

29:55.479 --> 30:03.527
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought we'd started off with this story tonight because I think this is very interesting and it's kind of a follow-up to this whole fallout that we were talking about earlier.

30:04.067 --> 30:07.310
[SPEAKER_05]: And whereas people reacted to our news as, who?

30:07.450 --> 30:07.971
[SPEAKER_05]: Who are these guys?

30:09.272 --> 30:11.373
[SPEAKER_05]: This story comes from GameDaily.com.

30:11.493 --> 30:14.595
[SPEAKER_05]: No one watches online video game TV.

30:15.335 --> 30:22.318
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, it's this report that was done by Forrester Research.

30:22.679 --> 30:31.283
[SPEAKER_05]: And the report found that 25% of online households have expressed interest in podcasting, but only 2% have experimented with audio downloads.

30:31.663 --> 30:36.765
[SPEAKER_05]: And only 1% of households actually got a podcast onto a player.

30:38.126 --> 30:50.972
[SPEAKER_05]: So podcasting is still kind of a very niche thing, and they're saying that, you know, when you consider that PodNova has 55,000 different podcasts available out there, it's still not really catching on.

30:51.112 --> 30:52.893
[SPEAKER_05]: I still say it's too new.

30:53.334 --> 30:57.456
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize podcasting, you know, it's a very trendy thing in the nerd culture right now.

30:58.176 --> 31:00.937
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's still going to be a little while before we see this catch on.

31:01.318 --> 31:05.660
[SPEAKER_05]: I think videocasting, honestly, is where it's at, and, you know, I'd love to do a...

31:06.340 --> 31:07.701
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.

31:34.392 --> 31:37.875
[SPEAKER_05]: Something to think about there, online video game TV.

31:37.895 --> 31:40.697
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys listen to any other podcasts besides this one?

31:42.018 --> 31:42.978
[SPEAKER_00]: I never have time.

31:43.198 --> 31:44.519
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even listen to this one.

31:44.619 --> 31:45.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's part of it.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.982
[SPEAKER_05]: I listen to a couple, but I wish I could listen to more.

31:48.102 --> 31:50.964
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like listening to my own voice, so I don't listen to our podcast.

31:52.265 --> 31:52.505
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

31:52.545 --> 31:54.166
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just always been like that.

31:54.186 --> 31:54.907
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a little weird.

31:55.567 --> 31:55.947
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

31:56.228 --> 31:56.888
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, not your voice.

31:56.908 --> 31:58.289
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying it's a little weird to hear yourself bat.

31:58.329 --> 32:00.251
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, you're weird too, but... Bite me.

32:01.071 --> 32:01.912
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, no...

32:03.087 --> 32:05.050
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of get weirded out by that.

32:05.210 --> 32:09.595
[SPEAKER_01]: I just never have any time.

32:09.875 --> 32:12.698
[SPEAKER_01]: I've downloaded a few podcasts.

32:12.778 --> 32:18.004
[SPEAKER_01]: For people I've actually met at the podcast awards, and I've listened to a few others.

32:18.545 --> 32:23.771
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to check out the ones that are out there, but I can't really dedicate any real time to it since I'm in school.

32:26.307 --> 32:29.070
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some comments in the chat room.

32:29.610 --> 32:32.233
[SPEAKER_05]: VXJasonXV says, Video casting is for porn.

32:32.733 --> 32:34.134
[SPEAKER_05]: Gives a little salute emote icon.

32:35.095 --> 32:37.217
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, Bring back the OLR webcam.

32:39.379 --> 32:39.639
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

32:39.680 --> 32:39.980
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

32:40.060 --> 32:43.263
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

32:43.463 --> 32:46.626
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other folks in chat are talking about some of the other shows that they listen to.

32:47.610 --> 32:53.954
[SPEAKER_05]: Some folks that listen to shows over at allgames.com or shows that are affiliated with all games such as Video Game Show.

32:54.735 --> 33:00.578
[SPEAKER_05]: Some folks saying they listen to Dignation, Dream Station CC.

33:01.138 --> 33:04.240
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they sent us something a while ago we played around Christmas time.

33:04.921 --> 33:05.901
[SPEAKER_05]: So very interesting.

33:06.202 --> 33:11.325
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Overnightscape was one of the ones I was listening to off and on because I met the guy who runs it.

33:11.365 --> 33:12.946
[SPEAKER_01]: He interviewed me at the podcast.

33:12.986 --> 33:14.166
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember I actually heard that.

33:14.186 --> 33:14.747
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

33:14.807 --> 33:14.967
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

33:15.814 --> 33:15.994
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

33:16.014 --> 33:19.115
[SPEAKER_05]: And you had an interview on the All Games podcast, didn't you, on Friday?

33:19.415 --> 33:20.676
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, All Games Interactive.

33:20.716 --> 33:20.976
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

33:21.516 --> 33:21.936
[SPEAKER_05]: Good time?

33:23.857 --> 33:24.057
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

33:25.517 --> 33:29.839
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, like, in such a rush that day.

33:29.859 --> 33:30.959
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what I was doing.

33:30.979 --> 33:32.660
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

33:32.840 --> 33:33.240
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.967
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33:57.369 --> 33:59.589
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that for defeating the odds?

33:59.709 --> 34:02.330
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine still works too, but I don't have a first gen.

34:02.390 --> 34:04.110
[SPEAKER_05]: I got mine a couple years after it was out.

34:04.170 --> 34:07.051
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought my Japanese PlayStation 2 pretty much just for Beatmania.

34:07.651 --> 34:10.772
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked up a couple other games, but pretty much that's the only one that gets played on it.

34:11.812 --> 34:22.014
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's actually reporting from CNN Money, from Chris Morris at CNN Money, stating that the PlayStation 2's price is going to drop.

34:23.320 --> 34:33.922
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's at $149, but now that the Xbox 360 is really staying there, it looks like they're going to be dropping the price by about $20.

34:36.382 --> 34:36.862
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

34:36.942 --> 34:41.263
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, in light of all these new systems coming out, they're going to be a little more expensive.

34:41.383 --> 34:46.124
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's, you know, formularic almost that these old consoles drop in price a little bit.

34:46.344 --> 34:48.784
[SPEAKER_05]: So some folks who still don't have a PS2 will be very happy.

34:49.424 --> 34:50.465
[SPEAKER_01]: It's $20, though.

34:50.605 --> 34:52.465
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if they really wanted to make it

34:53.491 --> 34:54.572
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already made back their money.

34:54.992 --> 34:57.253
[SPEAKER_01]: They should drop that thing to $99 and clear them out.

34:57.373 --> 34:59.314
[SPEAKER_03]: They just sell a hell of a lot of games that way.

35:00.195 --> 35:02.756
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard a rumor that they're actually talking $99 later.

35:03.097 --> 35:06.158
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe $99 will come at Christmas when PS3 is already out.

35:06.579 --> 35:11.261
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who out there is going, Damn, I'd buy that PS2 if it were only $20 cheaper.

35:13.974 --> 35:16.255
[SPEAKER_05]: Every dollar counts, though, if you're trying to budget out.

35:16.416 --> 35:27.202
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everybody is into games enough to want to buy a GameCube, a PlayStation 2, and an Xbox, never mind the DS, the PSP, and all that other stuff, too.

35:27.242 --> 35:30.084
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everybody is sick like we are and buys all those systems.

35:30.344 --> 35:31.285
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everybody can afford it.

35:31.625 --> 35:36.828
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I budget for those types of expenses, but not everybody can do that.

35:38.449 --> 35:39.770
[SPEAKER_05]: Every penny counts.

35:40.630 --> 35:41.931
[SPEAKER_05]: A penny saved is a penny earned.

35:43.012 --> 35:43.512
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, whatever.

35:44.125 --> 35:48.389
[SPEAKER_00]: A penny saved is a penny that you already earned that you just set aside.

35:48.770 --> 35:50.812
[SPEAKER_05]: A dollar saved is one you should send to me.

35:52.373 --> 35:55.136
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a phrase that I've never been able to get behind.

35:55.496 --> 35:59.941
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because a penny saved is a penny earned, but you've already earned it, so you didn't earn it twice.

36:00.561 --> 36:01.582
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's up with that?

36:02.343 --> 36:03.724
[SPEAKER_03]: Pennies aren't worth anything anyways.

36:03.944 --> 36:07.508
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you get behind the dollar saved is a dollar you should send to Orange Launch Radio?

36:08.613 --> 36:11.716
[SPEAKER_01]: It already says in my intro to pump up the volume to send me a dollar.

36:12.176 --> 36:13.677
[SPEAKER_01]: Two people have sent me a dollar.

36:13.997 --> 36:14.498
[SPEAKER_05]: For real?

36:14.818 --> 36:15.398
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that.

36:15.418 --> 36:17.720
[SPEAKER_01]: Two people have mailed me a dollar bill.

36:18.301 --> 36:18.921
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the cut?

36:19.261 --> 36:19.762
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

36:19.822 --> 36:20.903
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, where's our cut?

36:21.743 --> 36:25.767
[SPEAKER_01]: It was invested into the show to give me beer.

36:26.047 --> 36:26.927
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, fair enough.

36:26.948 --> 36:28.709
[SPEAKER_01]: That increases my entertainment value.

36:30.350 --> 36:33.773
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, for those folks... That bottle of fat tire that's in my fridge.

36:34.628 --> 36:40.732
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, for those folks who are ready to graduate to the PlayStation 3 and can't freaking wait for it, what's the latest on PlayStation 3?

36:41.232 --> 36:44.754
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you'll get to play it at E3 this year, which is awesome.

36:45.815 --> 36:46.975
[SPEAKER_03]: Except you've got to wait in line.

36:47.656 --> 36:48.156
[SPEAKER_03]: A long line.

36:48.416 --> 36:50.557
[SPEAKER_03]: A very, very, very, very, very long line.

36:51.198 --> 36:59.102
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, yeah, it will be there, but it's going to be pretty much like the PSP was when they first showed that a couple years ago.

36:59.843 --> 37:00.403
[SPEAKER_03]: Long line.

37:01.175 --> 37:05.242
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony and Nintendo love to do the long line to play something.

37:05.362 --> 37:08.267
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure this year Nintendo is going to have a long line to play The Revolution.

37:09.580 --> 37:11.001
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a big surprise.

37:11.061 --> 37:13.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully there will be some actual games there.

37:13.302 --> 37:15.923
[SPEAKER_05]: It gives it that exclusive club feeling to it in a way.

37:16.843 --> 37:18.864
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to see the PS3 at E3 and you didn't.

37:19.625 --> 37:20.765
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those things.

37:21.045 --> 37:22.866
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't wait in line for Zelda last year.

37:22.946 --> 37:35.892
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm crazy, but I just felt my three hours I could have waited in line to see Zelda or I could have actually taken time to really look at some of the things in Kenshiya Hall and there's some pretty good gems down there every year.

37:35.912 --> 37:36.052
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

37:39.057 --> 37:40.999
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumor or fact on this PS3 thing?

37:41.580 --> 37:43.302
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we don't really know until E3, right?

37:43.482 --> 37:46.285
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say probably fact because it makes perfect sense.

37:46.765 --> 37:47.826
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at last year.

37:48.467 --> 37:55.234
[SPEAKER_03]: They even went a step further at Microsoft's booth and they said, hey, you've got to be pressed in order to play the 360, bitch.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.778
[SPEAKER_03]: So just because you deem it fact, then it must be fact, right?

38:00.579 --> 38:01.280
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm speculating.

38:01.997 --> 38:04.579
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pulling that completely out of my ass.

38:04.959 --> 38:07.101
[SPEAKER_05]: You might remember a classic video game.

38:07.121 --> 38:09.363
[SPEAKER_05]: We're jumping from classic to new, but this is classic.

38:10.043 --> 38:10.964
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of This World.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.085
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember this game, Out of This World?

38:12.105 --> 38:13.026
[SPEAKER_05]: It was released in 1991.

38:13.406 --> 38:16.148
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say it came out on the Sega Genesis was one of the systems it was on.

38:16.508 --> 38:20.411
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a game I never really got into, but I know it has a really cult following to the game.

38:21.532 --> 38:31.000
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a really nice looking game and used 3D polygon really before it was... This was 1991, and we didn't really have PlayStation and things until...

38:31.500 --> 38:32.460
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Nintendo, baby!

38:59.406 --> 39:00.067
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the whole Sega Ages?

39:24.989 --> 39:26.950
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess this isn't really a new thing to do, but I don't know.

39:27.250 --> 39:33.631
[SPEAKER_05]: Something about this game in particular, seeing as it was more of a small title, it's kind of interesting to see this get re-released.

39:33.651 --> 39:36.812
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the hell's my remade friggin' Blaster Master?

39:36.832 --> 39:41.113
[SPEAKER_05]: You will get your remade Blaster Master when Jamie and I get our remade Guardian Legend.

39:41.153 --> 39:41.753
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

39:42.373 --> 39:42.773
[SPEAKER_05]: Drive-thru.

39:43.033 --> 39:45.073
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Borderbund, or was it Borderbund?

39:45.093 --> 39:45.653
[SPEAKER_05]: Broderbund.

39:45.754 --> 39:46.174
[SPEAKER_01]: Broderbund?

39:46.194 --> 39:46.694
[SPEAKER_01]: Broderbund?

39:46.994 --> 39:47.374
[SPEAKER_01]: Broderbund?

39:47.394 --> 39:47.934
[SPEAKER_01]: Broderbund?

39:53.183 --> 39:54.744
[SPEAKER_01]: Well-formed squishy buns?

39:55.225 --> 39:56.386
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they even exist anymore?

39:56.626 --> 39:57.447
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what else they made?

39:57.507 --> 39:57.847
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

39:57.867 --> 39:58.547
[SPEAKER_05]: The print shop.

39:58.868 --> 39:59.688
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the print shop?

39:59.949 --> 40:00.149
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

40:00.169 --> 40:02.911
[SPEAKER_05]: Where you could print those huge, hideous banners on the dot matrix printers?

40:02.971 --> 40:04.552
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck yeah.

40:05.453 --> 40:07.415
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would take like an hour to print your damn banners?

40:07.755 --> 40:09.136
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had the green and white paper?

40:09.376 --> 40:10.017
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that them?

40:10.918 --> 40:12.159
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure that was them.

40:12.479 --> 40:13.540
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to know what sucks?

40:13.620 --> 40:20.005
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that my old computer lab at my college had dot matrix printers with the green and white paper.

40:22.740 --> 40:25.121
[SPEAKER_05]: Comments from the chatroom, www.orangeillustrated.com.

40:25.141 --> 40:25.701
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on chat.

40:26.322 --> 40:28.783
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of celebration around Blaster Master.

40:28.903 --> 40:33.645
[SPEAKER_05]: 23rd Magus would like you to know Broderbund also did Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, which is another big title.

40:33.665 --> 40:34.065
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they did.

40:34.925 --> 40:35.146
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

40:36.126 --> 40:41.168
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to another story, let's head on over to Loki.

40:41.788 --> 40:42.149
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

40:42.809 --> 40:45.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we have some news on an Xbox Live Arcade game.

40:47.031 --> 40:49.152
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I have this game, yet have never played it.

40:49.352 --> 40:51.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it for free with one of those 12-month kits.

40:52.401 --> 40:52.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Bankshot Billiards 2

41:08.326 --> 41:09.847
[SPEAKER_03]: on his wonderful podcast.

41:31.349 --> 41:36.431
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't look like it was something I had to own, but a lot of my friends list is playing it, so I'm like, what am I missing out on?

41:36.771 --> 41:37.891
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like Yahoo Pool.

41:39.352 --> 41:40.492
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like billiards games.

41:40.832 --> 41:44.193
[SPEAKER_03]: I only have this on my 360 because it's free.

41:46.014 --> 41:46.634
[SPEAKER_03]: That is it.

41:47.529 --> 41:47.929
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

41:48.550 --> 41:52.813
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys like to send us e-mails once in a while over at www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

41:52.833 --> 41:56.875
[SPEAKER_05]: You can send your e-mails to mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

41:56.915 --> 42:02.739
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you do so, Dark Sakura will dig through the e-mail and pull out some of her favorites and scold them on air.

42:02.999 --> 42:04.520
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to wear a hazmat suit lately.

42:05.181 --> 42:11.245
[SPEAKER_05]: And last week, Dark Sakura wasn't here, so we did some MySpace messages because people have been sending us messages on MySpace.

42:11.265 --> 42:12.306
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did a couple of those.

42:12.646 --> 42:14.127
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need to catch up on some e-mails.

42:14.187 --> 42:16.809
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's have Dark Sakura get on the suit.

42:17.649 --> 42:21.072
[SPEAKER_05]: Dig in the mailbag and pull out some, hopefully not anthrax.

42:21.192 --> 42:22.513
[SPEAKER_05]: What'd you get?

42:24.214 --> 42:24.714
[SPEAKER_01]: Anthrax!

42:26.115 --> 42:26.696
[SPEAKER_01]: Freeing the noise.

42:27.776 --> 42:28.036
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

42:29.678 --> 42:30.959
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one from Blaze.

42:32.319 --> 42:34.241
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura.

42:34.381 --> 42:35.662
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is my name not first?

42:35.702 --> 42:36.222
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, gee.

42:36.803 --> 42:37.243
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch it.

42:38.043 --> 42:44.388
[SPEAKER_01]: After hearing the discussion about Kingdom Hearts 2 and the extremely slight chance of an MMORPG, I started thinking about it.

42:44.847 --> 42:53.935
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to avoid having everyone as a Keyblade holder, thus resulting in no bad guy characters, perhaps a movie could introduce an evil Keyblade allowing for a balance of characters.

42:54.016 --> 42:54.536
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a thought.

42:55.417 --> 43:03.324
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I don't know if anyone still cares anymore, but Microsoft is seriously sending out their Xbox Live Diamond cards as fast as they were putting out the Xbox 360s.

43:04.005 --> 43:07.068
[SPEAKER_01]: Sky, by the way, absolutely loved Need for Speed Most Wanted on my Xbox 360.

43:07.128 --> 43:07.948
[SPEAKER_01]: How dare you bash it?

43:08.549 --> 43:09.210
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't bash it.

43:09.250 --> 43:09.450
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

43:11.404 --> 43:36.513
[SPEAKER_05]: I may have bashed it and said how horrible looking it is but I also said I couldn't stop playing it for like a whole week and I think that says something that you can have a sometimes there's it's the reason why when games are reviewed by people there's that fun factor that contributes really big to it that's outside of graphics outside of sound outside of all that crap there's fun factor and for whatever reason and I still can't put my finger on it I found that game to be so much fun

43:40.996 --> 43:45.497
[SPEAKER_01]: On the subject of eating healthy while gaming, I will take a six-pack of Propel water.

43:45.537 --> 43:46.537
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to drink that stuff all the time.

43:47.117 --> 43:48.818
[SPEAKER_01]: And drink that instead of a bunch of soda.

43:49.038 --> 43:50.018
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I love the show.

43:50.078 --> 43:50.778
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good work.

43:52.438 --> 43:52.918
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good.

43:53.599 --> 43:56.539
[SPEAKER_01]: But it got to be a little too sugary for me when I started cutting out a lot of sugar.

43:57.339 --> 44:02.060
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm drinking oxygen water, which gives you very clean breath.

44:02.100 --> 44:04.501
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like a way to rip you off at the store.

44:05.021 --> 44:07.281
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually was cheaper than the other waters, which is why I bought it.

44:07.681 --> 44:08.002
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

44:08.462 --> 44:08.782
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

44:09.462 --> 44:10.002
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do we have?

44:12.036 --> 44:16.019
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, did you already cover the MySpace message from Joey?

44:16.379 --> 44:17.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that was last week.

44:18.000 --> 44:18.960
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, fine then.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.342
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I... Stealing my thunder.

44:21.362 --> 44:22.302
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, look, you weren't here.

44:22.463 --> 44:23.063
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm kidding.

44:24.464 --> 44:25.384
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was in a coma.

44:26.905 --> 44:27.846
[SPEAKER_01]: I was dead at the time.

44:27.866 --> 44:30.388
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be back in a coma if you don't start reading some more email messages.

44:30.408 --> 44:31.468
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's rude to point.

44:31.488 --> 44:33.790
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to watch out or I'll kick you from chat.

44:36.772 --> 44:37.012
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

44:37.717 --> 44:43.504
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey again, I didn't think you'd read my question on your show, let alone when there are two weeks worth of nails to go through.

44:43.524 --> 44:43.904
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks again.

44:55.495 --> 44:59.858
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone ahead and picked up Beatmania and have two observations and two questions about it.

45:00.919 --> 45:07.523
[SPEAKER_01]: One, despite being a hopeless, hopeless novice right now, I really prefer 7Key, the 2DX mode over 5Key.

45:07.964 --> 45:14.248
[SPEAKER_01]: The latter seems to only have three level one songs, while 7Key seems to have a better variety of songs suited for all skill levels.

45:14.969 --> 45:18.290
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, you mentioned the overly colorful and techno-trippy interface.

45:18.390 --> 45:21.311
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, what it reminded me of most was Amplitude.

45:21.471 --> 45:25.553
[SPEAKER_01]: Although Harmonic's name doesn't appear on the game, I'm wondering how much involvement the team had on this one.

45:25.993 --> 45:26.293
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero.

45:26.333 --> 45:26.653
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero.

45:26.953 --> 45:27.633
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all Konami.

45:28.394 --> 45:38.337
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami made this game the very first Beatmania was in 98, and I want to say the first 2DX was 2000 or 2001, don't quote me on that, but somewhere in that area.

45:38.597 --> 45:42.359
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, no wait, Beatmania was probably 97, because DDR first came out in 98, so...

45:44.693 --> 45:45.293
[SPEAKER_01]: Beatmania was 97.

45:45.734 --> 45:47.355
[SPEAKER_05]: Needless to say, they're old.

45:47.395 --> 45:51.478
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the emulator that was the thing at the time was BM98.

45:51.638 --> 45:52.979
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, that's right.

45:53.260 --> 45:54.761
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have BM98.

45:54.801 --> 45:55.081
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

45:55.141 --> 45:55.622
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks.

45:56.222 --> 46:00.666
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't, because it has all of the neat... Like, the person who did the...

46:01.838 --> 46:02.759
[SPEAKER_01]: The Metal Gear music.

46:03.059 --> 46:03.439
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

46:03.519 --> 46:05.680
[SPEAKER_01]: With the, oh no, the truck has started to move.

46:06.040 --> 46:06.361
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

46:07.521 --> 46:12.864
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of amplitude and sort of frequency, is it possible to use the Beatmania controller with those games?

46:12.884 --> 46:15.185
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really tried it, but it seems to make sense doing so.

46:15.646 --> 46:16.086
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

46:16.366 --> 46:22.729
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it works because I don't, those seven buttons on your 2DX controller are not like circle, square, remapped.

46:23.330 --> 46:24.971
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a completely different signals.

46:25.031 --> 46:25.711
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it works.

46:26.631 --> 46:29.553
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they should, I think Harmonix should have released a controller for those games.

46:29.573 --> 46:30.794
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would have been a lot of fun, but...

46:31.565 --> 46:32.766
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one.

46:32.926 --> 46:37.670
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, which of the songs on Beatmania US would you most like to see on DDR Supernova's eventual console port?

46:38.210 --> 46:38.931
[SPEAKER_01]: Just curious.

46:39.051 --> 46:42.314
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. T and one of the club mixes of 20 November would be my pick.

46:42.474 --> 46:43.214
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate 20 November.

46:43.755 --> 46:43.995
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

46:44.095 --> 46:45.636
[SPEAKER_05]: No, somebody in chat wanted me to say that earlier.

46:46.197 --> 46:48.679
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 November's okay, but it's not as great as people say it is.

46:49.539 --> 46:50.140
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad Boy Bass.

46:50.340 --> 46:50.680
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

46:50.860 --> 46:51.381
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that song.

46:53.843 --> 46:58.987
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really not very excited about many of the things that are in Beatmania that aren't already on DDR.

46:59.793 --> 47:02.255
[SPEAKER_01]: There's stuff from 8th style I'd still like to see.

47:05.177 --> 47:11.901
[SPEAKER_01]: I still want to be able to play... Crap, now I forgot the name of the song.

47:14.103 --> 47:14.443
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

47:14.663 --> 47:15.003
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the...

47:17.930 --> 47:18.470
[SPEAKER_01]: D2, Spooky, R-Love

47:44.017 --> 47:46.839
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've been wondering something for a little while now.

47:46.859 --> 47:50.942
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been listening to you guys and Gal for about a year now as a podcast.

47:51.642 --> 47:56.725
[SPEAKER_01]: On a consistent basis, you guys seem to bring your classic and more often than not obscure games from the past.

47:57.206 --> 47:58.166
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I love, by the way.

47:58.646 --> 48:01.748
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question is this, when are you going to do a strictly classic gaming episode?

48:02.109 --> 48:06.511
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I remember that being suggested in passing on a show right before you changed to the new format.

48:07.092 --> 48:12.255
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of miss DarkSakura's tips section when I hear the music for the mailbag, but oh well.

48:14.099 --> 48:20.444
[SPEAKER_05]: I would speculate we'll probably do that if there's going to be a show where we can't be here again.

48:20.524 --> 48:23.126
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a couple months ago, Loki had to fill in a couple weeks.

48:23.766 --> 48:28.889
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have time to pre-tape in advance, we'll probably do a classic game show next time we're all not going to be here.

48:29.250 --> 48:34.593
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly, because of E3 and everything, none of us can really afford to all of us be gone.

48:35.734 --> 48:37.916
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you out next week, DarkSakura, for birthday?

48:38.076 --> 48:39.437
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm going to be...

48:40.740 --> 48:43.314
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're out in two weeks for wedding, right?

48:43.495 --> 48:44.560
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so are you.

48:46.365 --> 48:47.546
[SPEAKER_05]: But is the wedding on Sunday?

48:47.566 --> 48:48.166
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

48:48.526 --> 48:50.107
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought it was Saturday this whole time.

48:50.347 --> 48:50.768
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, crap.

48:51.308 --> 48:53.810
[SPEAKER_05]: Then maybe there'll be one coming up sooner than later.

48:54.110 --> 48:55.290
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll podcast your wedding.

48:55.370 --> 48:56.931
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the day of Loki's wedding.

48:56.951 --> 48:59.173
[SPEAKER_05]: I joked about that, but yeah.

48:59.193 --> 49:01.334
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we need to plan on that.

49:01.374 --> 49:04.336
[SPEAKER_05]: So probably the day of Loki's wedding, since we can't do a show live, maybe we'll do that.

49:04.796 --> 49:05.316
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good idea.

49:06.057 --> 49:09.379
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe we can invite some other folks to talk about it, too.

49:09.399 --> 49:10.600
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fun.

49:11.556 --> 49:14.098
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's also another bit on this.

49:14.918 --> 49:17.060
[SPEAKER_01]: When we mentioned Captain N, he brought up Kid Video.

49:18.701 --> 49:23.684
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to watch Kid Video religiously when I was, what, seven?

49:25.626 --> 49:26.967
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I know Kid Video.

49:27.127 --> 49:29.869
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about a little garage band.

49:29.889 --> 49:31.330
[SPEAKER_01]: They get sucked into an animated world.

49:31.350 --> 49:34.572
[SPEAKER_01]: It had the little pixie girl who would sneeze.

49:35.613 --> 49:37.274
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really crazy.

49:37.434 --> 49:38.515
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember Kid Video.

49:39.475 --> 49:40.176
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember Kid Video?

49:40.196 --> 49:40.296
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

49:40.649 --> 49:41.130
[SPEAKER_03]: PUNCTUATION

50:06.633 --> 50:10.416
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a single punctuation point except at the very end of this email.

50:10.636 --> 50:12.797
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought I'd point that out.

50:13.198 --> 50:13.918
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a grammar nerd.

50:14.018 --> 50:14.459
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you are.

50:15.239 --> 50:19.262
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me see if I can... I'm good at interpreting that stuff.

50:19.282 --> 50:19.762
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.

50:19.962 --> 50:20.763
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm my mailbox.

50:20.843 --> 50:21.143
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

50:22.524 --> 50:22.925
Meow.

50:24.866 --> 50:25.106
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

50:25.466 --> 50:26.307
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get right to the point.

50:26.347 --> 50:29.369
[SPEAKER_01]: I was listening to your podcast last week while you had the guy from Konami.

50:29.529 --> 50:36.194
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my question is, I hear everybody talking about DDR Supernova, but for some reason it's like they skipped Flordia...

50:36.946 --> 50:37.607
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's Florida.

50:37.647 --> 50:38.508
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida.

50:38.928 --> 50:39.269
[SPEAKER_07]: Florida.

50:39.549 --> 50:40.290
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's in Florida.

50:41.432 --> 50:41.692
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

50:41.792 --> 50:43.734
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no release date or anything.

50:43.875 --> 50:53.707
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys can give me a link or even some kind of update, I would be really grateful because I know a lot of people out there that don't know either and you guys wouldn't just be helping me but many people.

50:54.087 --> 50:56.430
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks and keep up the good work on Lounge Radio for life.

50:56.952 --> 50:57.833
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys will get it.

50:58.133 --> 50:59.013
[SPEAKER_05]: Every state's going to have it.

50:59.053 --> 51:01.135
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it wants to know when Supernova's coming out in Florida.

51:01.155 --> 51:03.897
[SPEAKER_05]: Supernova's coming out in Florida when Supernova comes out for everybody.

51:04.297 --> 51:09.200
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess the rumor was that they were taking orders for the first 50 machines and then it closed.

51:09.701 --> 51:13.223
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know how much to really credit all that.

51:13.563 --> 51:16.785
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say it was supposed to be out this month, right?

51:16.865 --> 51:20.588
[SPEAKER_05]: So any day now, really, we should start seeing these machines pop up.

51:21.008 --> 51:24.010
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it'll really spread like wildfire until over the summer.

51:24.090 --> 51:26.692
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to wait until summer for your local arcade to get this.

51:27.092 --> 51:37.420
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you live near a big city with a big arcade that has, you know, Hat Extreme and the other DDR games, this one will be coming as well.

51:37.500 --> 51:38.121
[SPEAKER_05]: Just give it time.

51:39.382 --> 51:42.684
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we don't keep tabs on every arcade in the country, so we can't ask.

51:42.784 --> 51:44.265
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be afraid to ask your local arcade.

51:44.305 --> 51:46.647
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good way to show that you support it, too.

51:46.707 --> 51:47.328
[SPEAKER_01]: DDR Freak.

51:47.828 --> 51:49.409
[SPEAKER_01]: DDR Freak has a locations listing.

51:50.050 --> 51:55.594
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that's put up there, being a moderator there, we regularly verify those to make sure...

51:56.174 --> 51:57.415
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

52:16.327 --> 52:26.034
[SPEAKER_01]: Just listen to Part A of the podcast, and I'd be genuinely surprised if the majority of those 50 launch titles weren't the NES Genesis TurboGrafx-16 downloadables.

52:27.415 --> 52:31.558
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I think he'll find out in Part B, I kind of corrected myself there.

52:31.998 --> 52:34.260
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I figured I'd go ahead and address this.

52:34.860 --> 52:43.086
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we'll see as many as six full retail available titles to go with those, just out of curiosity and to compare how many Xbox Arcade launch games were there.

52:44.707 --> 52:46.168
[SPEAKER_01]: How many Xbox Live Arcade games were there?

52:46.568 --> 52:47.929
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say 10 to 15, because I can't remember exactly.

52:47.949 --> 52:49.791
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought a lot of them, but not all of them.

52:49.931 --> 52:54.494
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask Major Nelson, he'd know.

53:14.431 --> 53:16.211
[SPEAKER_01]: You say that and I keep thinking of I Dream of Jeannie.

53:16.832 --> 53:17.112
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

53:19.092 --> 53:22.073
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one says, Hey guys, doing a great job with the podcast.

53:22.413 --> 53:25.734
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite thing to do after work is to play World of Warcraft while listening to the show.

53:26.334 --> 53:26.714
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.

53:26.954 --> 53:28.415
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, that's so cool.

53:28.455 --> 53:31.075
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of World of Warcraft, did you... Alright, sorry.

53:31.355 --> 53:31.816
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sorry.

53:32.116 --> 53:32.756
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

53:33.700 --> 53:38.542
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I saw the most effed up video this week, and it was... The Lord of the Rings?

53:38.622 --> 53:41.022
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, the people crashing the funeral party.

53:41.383 --> 53:50.626
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, somebody... Okay, somebody, like, in real life passed away, and they were holding an online, like, funeral service for this... I think it was a she that passed away.

53:51.186 --> 53:58.628
[SPEAKER_05]: And since it was on a PvP server, these guys had posted about it on a forum, and what happened is that... I think it was a Horde character.

53:58.668 --> 54:00.049
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a bunch of... This whole big...

54:00.911 --> 54:03.761
[SPEAKER_05]: group on the Alliance side came to the funeral and killed them all.

54:05.447 --> 54:06.350
[SPEAKER_05]: That's horrible!

54:08.282 --> 54:35.752
[SPEAKER_05]: part of me is like that is so wrong but there's another half of me like the same half the same half that really likes South Park and that fucked up stuff that goes you know like and I know it's really wrong but that's let me put it this way it goes to show why I hate the PvP servers on World of Warcraft sorry to this guy if you're a PvP player whatever floats your boat I personally hate the PvP servers I had bad experience with PvP but anyway can I finish my email now?

54:35.792 --> 54:36.612
[SPEAKER_05]: yes you may sorry

54:37.796 --> 54:39.057
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Rob!

54:41.598 --> 54:52.224
[SPEAKER_01]: Although this isn't exactly headline news like the red steel screenshots drool, I work for Philips and they're working on this new technology which sounds like something I've only dreamed about.

54:52.784 --> 55:03.891
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine feeling the rush of wind when jumping out of your plane in Metal Gear Solid 3 or having your sofa rumble and all the lights in your room flicker red when Sephiroth appears in the flames in Final Fantasy VII.

55:04.932 --> 55:19.180
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be really cheesy, but if the technology is really good and becomes widespread and developers start creating games with this in mind, along with how excited I am about the innovative revolution, the next few years could be huge for gaming and where it's headed.

55:19.600 --> 55:21.761
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave a link to AMBX.com.

55:22.681 --> 55:29.305
[SPEAKER_01]: I said there's some video on the site that gives you an idea of the lighting effects we're talking about, lightning strikes and all the lights in the rooms flicker.

55:30.154 --> 55:32.215
[SPEAKER_01]: A Plane Flies By and Creates a Rush of Wind.

55:32.255 --> 55:33.676
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, it's from dinky fans, but still.

55:34.176 --> 55:35.356
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't just for gaming.

55:35.376 --> 55:42.139
[SPEAKER_01]: Suppose it's for movies, music, PC versions of games are supposed to already be released this year, and console versions next.

55:42.339 --> 55:43.280
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for this at E3.

55:43.940 --> 55:44.920
[SPEAKER_01]: Think this will catch on?

55:45.020 --> 55:46.361
[SPEAKER_01]: If not this, then technology.

55:46.401 --> 55:48.582
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this, revolution seems to be a step in that direction.

55:49.022 --> 55:49.882
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good work.

55:50.083 --> 55:54.464
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use this, you can refer to me as Bear Who Drive Car.

55:54.965 --> 55:57.346
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I actually didn't see that until the very end.

55:57.366 --> 55:57.926
[SPEAKER_01]: My apologies.

55:59.038 --> 55:59.378
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

55:59.418 --> 56:03.525
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, but it's ridiculous how much I want a goddamn DS Lite.

56:03.906 --> 56:08.333
[SPEAKER_01]: I also agree with Sky, Final Fantasy XI is going to die shortly after Xbox 360 has released this expansion.

56:10.436 --> 56:11.757
[SPEAKER_05]: I did say... I said that.

56:11.797 --> 56:12.498
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I must have.

56:12.518 --> 56:13.959
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's gonna die.

56:14.019 --> 56:17.481
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's gonna... I actually think it's gonna... Oh, I remember what it was.

56:17.501 --> 56:21.564
[SPEAKER_05]: The comment was that I said the third expansion is gonna be the last one, probably, and then it will start to die off.

56:22.685 --> 56:25.347
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it'll be shortly, but I think, you know, in the next couple years.

56:25.947 --> 56:28.509
[SPEAKER_05]: There will always be crazies that play Final Fantasy XI.

56:28.549 --> 56:29.470
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably I'll be one of them.

56:30.351 --> 56:32.232
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like there's crazies that still play EverQuest.

56:32.432 --> 56:34.073
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know I use that term endearingly.

56:34.654 --> 56:34.714
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

56:36.239 --> 56:41.129
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the popularity... You'll see server consolidations in a good two years.

56:45.215 --> 56:49.736
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing I want to comment on that, the whole room lighting thing, that technology has actually been around a while.

56:50.156 --> 57:01.319
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Commodore 64, I remember this, there used to be a program where you could have the Commodore 64 control the lights in your house for like when you're away on vacation or whatever, you could have the Commodore 64 regulating the lights in your house.

57:01.599 --> 57:04.160
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not this huge... I think this is a little something different.

57:05.360 --> 57:12.522
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I know, but they're saying that you want to change the lights red for when Sephiroth comes in and all this other lighting effects you can do in your house, right?

57:13.150 --> 57:15.511
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it'd be more like an interactive station.

57:16.792 --> 57:17.112
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

57:17.232 --> 57:25.095
[SPEAKER_01]: But they actually, there were things very similar to that, the previous E3s, like the, what was it called, the ass kicker or something?

57:27.016 --> 57:31.418
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing that you put under your chair and it makes, and you feel the bass in your butt or something?

57:32.679 --> 57:39.362
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that that thing was kind of cool, but you know, like it, especially for the music games or for some of the effects in the games...

57:41.685 --> 57:49.249
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, though, that having something immersive like that is going to be pricey, but I think it really would enhance the experience.

57:49.809 --> 57:50.389
[SPEAKER_05]: Be interesting.

57:51.249 --> 57:51.510
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

57:52.930 --> 57:53.310
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

57:54.051 --> 57:54.691
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

57:54.711 --> 57:55.031
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

57:55.051 --> 57:58.673
[SPEAKER_05]: With all that, we're just one step closer to the holodeck from Star Trek.

57:58.853 --> 58:00.834
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where gaming will be in 50 years.

58:00.894 --> 58:01.574
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be the holodeck.

58:02.611 --> 58:05.713
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had this conversation with somebody like a year and a half ago.

58:06.013 --> 58:08.295
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing our big Trekkie nerd discussion.

58:08.615 --> 58:12.038
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were talking about how holodecks are like the Nintendo of the future.

58:13.819 --> 58:14.099
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty.

58:14.139 --> 58:16.261
[SPEAKER_05]: Someday we'll do this show in a holodeck form.

58:16.301 --> 58:16.901
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be amazing.

58:17.261 --> 58:19.563
[SPEAKER_05]: You could, you know, sit on our laps during the show.

58:19.623 --> 58:20.163
[SPEAKER_05]: No, please don't.

58:20.243 --> 58:21.224
[SPEAKER_05]: That's violating us.

58:21.884 --> 58:22.185
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

58:23.546 --> 58:24.166
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

58:25.607 --> 58:28.069
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have a contest to settle, do we not?

58:29.530 --> 58:29.970
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps.

58:30.390 --> 58:30.831
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

58:30.851 --> 58:31.251
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a

58:56.960 --> 58:57.921
[SPEAKER_05]: You always keep them low.

58:57.961 --> 58:58.441
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do this.

58:58.801 --> 58:58.441
1, 2, 3, 4.

59:00.082 --> 59:00.803
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's our winner.

59:00.943 --> 59:05.686
[SPEAKER_05]: Our winner is... I have to verify that they got two characters right here.

59:06.507 --> 59:08.949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they said David Palmer and Edgar Stiles.

59:08.969 --> 59:10.950
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are indeed two people that died this season.

59:11.371 --> 59:14.193
[SPEAKER_05]: So say congratulations, everybody, to MiniMe283.

59:14.273 --> 59:17.035
[SPEAKER_05]: He won the 24 contest.

59:17.175 --> 59:17.855
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our chatters.

59:18.276 --> 59:19.136
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, one of our chatters.

59:19.456 --> 59:20.637
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it when the chatty people win.

59:20.657 --> 59:21.418
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, MiniMe283.

59:22.318 --> 59:23.858
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's actually, I think, eating right now.

59:24.819 --> 59:26.779
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's away and didn't even hear that.

59:27.379 --> 59:27.679
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

59:28.079 --> 59:28.639
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well.

59:29.040 --> 59:30.140
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be mini food.

59:32.200 --> 59:34.701
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so DarkSakura, remember what they're going to win in that prize pack?

59:34.721 --> 59:35.921
[SPEAKER_05]: Will I forward this to myself here?

59:36.201 --> 59:37.401
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

59:37.841 --> 59:40.042
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the game and the shirt, right?

59:40.222 --> 59:41.042
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a bunch of stuff.

59:41.822 --> 59:42.623
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be good times.

59:43.143 --> 59:47.244
[SPEAKER_05]: So big thanks to our buddies over at 2K Games that are hooking us up with these prize packs.

59:48.584 --> 59:49.144
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.

59:51.126 --> 59:53.308
[SPEAKER_05]: People like to win free stuff.

59:53.328 --> 59:57.291
[SPEAKER_05]: They like to win free stuff so much that we're going to give away something else right now.

59:58.031 --> 01:00:02.074
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to give away also a copy of Amped 3.

01:00:02.674 --> 01:00:03.455
[SPEAKER_05]: For the 360.

01:00:03.515 --> 01:00:05.056
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, for the Xbox 360.

01:00:06.257 --> 01:00:07.938
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've played this game a lot, Loki, right?

01:00:08.479 --> 01:00:09.219
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you do in this game?

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.141
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a basic snowboarding game.

01:00:12.221 --> 01:00:16.184
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, what kind of sets it apart is the way they kind of do the storyline.

01:00:16.484 --> 01:00:19.166
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done with sock puppets and just weird

01:00:19.858 --> 01:00:24.341
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, give me a number between 1 and that many times 10.

01:00:49.033 --> 01:00:51.215
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's go with 14.

01:00:53.937 --> 01:00:54.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's see.

01:00:54.937 --> 01:00:54.917
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:06.946
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the same person that won last?

01:01:07.006 --> 01:01:07.646
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think that is.

01:01:07.686 --> 01:01:08.687
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is a different person.

01:01:09.287 --> 01:01:10.568
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this one wins.

01:01:11.989 --> 01:01:15.432
[SPEAKER_05]: This goes to MikeG1Amp3.

01:01:15.992 --> 01:01:16.433
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

01:01:16.693 --> 01:01:17.013
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:19.252
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations to you, my friend.

01:01:20.374 --> 01:01:20.855
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a winner.

01:01:21.496 --> 01:01:25.323
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to everybody that participated, and we'll be doing more giveaways in the future.

01:01:25.884 --> 01:01:26.164
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

01:01:27.026 --> 01:01:27.286
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:01:27.747 --> 01:01:31.694
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to our next story, and that comes courtesy of me.

01:01:32.776 --> 01:01:33.437
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XI

01:01:54.298 --> 01:01:56.339
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, April 20th, we're the secret secret character junkie.

01:02:19.417 --> 01:02:20.237
[SPEAKER_03]: will be available.

01:02:20.257 --> 01:02:20.677
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

01:02:20.738 --> 01:02:23.779
[SPEAKER_05]: Junkie Horror will be an unlockable job class in the new Final Fantasy.

01:02:23.819 --> 01:02:24.279
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be great.

01:02:25.899 --> 01:02:27.240
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll all be Mithras.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:27.940
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine that.

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:28.841
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll all be Mithras.

01:02:29.141 --> 01:02:30.021
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they'd be Taro.

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:33.542
[SPEAKER_05]: I would play a Taro Junkie Horror.

01:02:33.562 --> 01:02:34.863
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be fun, actually.

01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:35.583
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be a good time.

01:02:36.483 --> 01:02:36.824
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:02:37.224 --> 01:02:38.344
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what do you got?

01:02:39.364 --> 01:02:44.186
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some info about the IEMA and VSDA merging.

01:02:44.847 --> 01:02:48.828
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, I always hear about the VSDA, just job-related stuff.

01:02:49.469 --> 01:03:04.277
[SPEAKER_03]: The Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association, basically the VSTA of video games, and the VSTA, the Video Software Dealers Association, who basically represent all the mass merchants, video specialty stores, etc.

01:03:04.998 --> 01:03:07.199
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now they're combined, so it's going to be one agency.

01:03:08.658 --> 01:03:12.641
[SPEAKER_03]: One place for all the interactive software sales and stuff.

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:26.132
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, they have to say, by coming together in one organization, the retailers, distributors of DVDs and video games will increase their collective power and the benefit from business acumen and product knowledge of one another.

01:03:26.773 --> 01:03:32.517
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's basically quoted from the chairman, VSTA chairman, Bob Geisman.

01:03:33.878 --> 01:03:35.440
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's pretty cool.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.902
[SPEAKER_03]: That means I might have to go to VSTA this year.

01:03:37.922 --> 01:03:38.382
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:03:39.326 --> 01:03:45.528
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, they always throw a really cool show down in Vegas, so... Right about the same time as the porno convention.

01:03:46.788 --> 01:03:47.388
[SPEAKER_03]: Right next door.

01:03:48.148 --> 01:03:50.449
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think long-term effects of this will be on the game industry?

01:03:50.689 --> 01:03:50.909
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything?

01:03:51.129 --> 01:03:51.489
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

01:03:52.250 --> 01:04:08.194
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna see, definitely, you know, the IEMA and VSDA are gonna be, you know, ones saying, you know, hell no, we don't want these stupid video game laws, you know, ones that they're trying to pass limiting the sales of this stuff.

01:04:08.969 --> 01:04:09.269
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

01:04:27.543 --> 01:04:28.083
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero Peripheral

01:04:50.189 --> 01:04:55.454
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they've mapped different WAV files into the controller's buttons so that you press the button and it will start playing the loop.

01:04:56.054 --> 01:04:59.117
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you, because you've mapped the different sounds, you can sort of play different stuff on it.

01:04:59.157 --> 01:05:02.660
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like, well, I don't know, like... It's a MIDI sequencer.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.342
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I was about to say.

01:05:06.563 --> 01:05:07.064
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um...

01:05:08.211 --> 01:05:12.453
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, even RedOctane kind of, you know, thinks it's pretty cool.

01:05:12.773 --> 01:05:19.336
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a quote here that says, we in Harmonix both are very much, I'm sorry, are both very much encouraged by this type of fandom.

01:05:19.796 --> 01:05:25.879
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a game that a community like this thrives around is a great achievement, but it's the community that keeps it going.

01:05:25.919 --> 01:05:26.479
[SPEAKER_01]: They're awesome.

01:05:29.321 --> 01:05:31.842
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was actually a quote from John Tam.

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:34.263
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that they endorsed the hacking.

01:05:34.303 --> 01:05:35.724
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool of them, you know.

01:05:36.304 --> 01:05:36.444
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,

01:05:37.325 --> 01:05:45.108
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think that we're going to see more new innovation based on the fan community.

01:05:45.948 --> 01:06:00.974
[SPEAKER_01]: I really see that a lot of game companies are not going to be as willing to experiment in depth, but when it comes from the fans and they see that there's a type of interest in this type of thing, it might turn on a few light bulbs and have the hamster wheels moving.

01:06:03.955 --> 01:06:04.916
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to another story.

01:06:05.974 --> 01:06:08.716
[SPEAKER_05]: Spike Lee, Inside Man, Inside the Inside Man

01:06:36.735 --> 01:06:40.358
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's in the movie because they're trying to depict video games as violent.

01:06:41.139 --> 01:06:45.943
[SPEAKER_05]: And Spike Lee is hoping that this scene doesn't actually get done in a future game.

01:06:46.343 --> 01:06:53.790
[SPEAKER_05]: He explains, I just hope people understand that that is an absolute statement about my horror at how violent these games that young kids play are.

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:57.853
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the infatuation with violence and gangster rap among the black community.

01:06:58.234 --> 01:07:01.657
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a real game, but not that far-fetched from the games that are being sold.

01:07:02.884 --> 01:07:06.507
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my thought that Spike Lee has decided to believe everything he sees on TV.

01:07:08.269 --> 01:07:08.729
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:10.330
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not violent enough.

01:07:11.792 --> 01:07:12.853
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not satisfied.

01:07:13.213 --> 01:07:13.934
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to see more?

01:07:13.954 --> 01:07:16.316
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to see more violent stuff?

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:16.896
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.

01:07:16.916 --> 01:07:17.477
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:07:17.837 --> 01:07:22.621
[SPEAKER_05]: Might I also point out Spike Lee has brought to you many different films out there.

01:07:23.262 --> 01:07:26.965
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to think of some of these that are R-rated movies that he's done.

01:07:28.066 --> 01:07:29.667
[SPEAKER_05]: What is Do the Right Thing R-rated?

01:07:30.187 --> 01:07:30.648
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

01:07:32.455 --> 01:07:32.875
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

01:07:35.457 --> 01:07:37.198
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, USA, that was an R-rated movie.

01:07:37.478 --> 01:07:39.579
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see, how about Malcolm X?

01:07:39.619 --> 01:07:40.760
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that rated R as well?

01:07:41.981 --> 01:07:42.821
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't doubt it.

01:07:44.222 --> 01:07:46.083
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it was PG-13.

01:07:46.143 --> 01:07:48.044
[SPEAKER_05]: Still not appropriate for children under 13, though.

01:07:48.685 --> 01:07:49.846
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the idea here.

01:07:49.886 --> 01:07:52.007
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kind of trying to be a smartass on this one.

01:07:52.947 --> 01:07:57.710
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Hollywood puts out the violent stuff, too, so I don't really get it.

01:07:58.231 --> 01:08:00.432
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like it's the pot calling the kettle black.

01:08:01.735 --> 01:08:02.235
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack Thompson's Claim

01:08:31.587 --> 01:08:32.488
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a second.

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:32.828
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:08:33.108 --> 01:08:35.569
[SPEAKER_03]: I do remember a game where you shoved grenades in people's mouths.

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.850
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:08:36.610 --> 01:08:37.711
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaster Master.

01:08:38.051 --> 01:08:41.333
[SPEAKER_03]: That fucking frog had it coming to him and he tossed grenades in his mouth.

01:08:42.314 --> 01:08:42.974
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that.

01:08:43.374 --> 01:08:45.716
[SPEAKER_03]: Spike Lee, you were beat by it quite a long time.

01:08:45.796 --> 01:08:51.079
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's when you hit pause while it's exploding and then you wait like six seconds and unpause and it'll kill him.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.181
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, but still, it's been done.

01:08:55.787 --> 01:08:56.668
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaster Master did it.

01:08:57.128 --> 01:09:03.292
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think somebody should make a game that's like Kaboom, but instead it's just a giant mouth that's catching all these grenades falling from the sky.

01:09:03.312 --> 01:09:04.113
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be great.

01:09:04.793 --> 01:09:06.514
[SPEAKER_05]: What a perfect response to this article.

01:09:07.015 --> 01:09:11.257
[SPEAKER_05]: Send a nice little care package over to Spike Lee and say, with love, the gaming community.

01:09:13.259 --> 01:09:13.639
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

01:09:14.299 --> 01:09:15.820
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of movies soon to be made.

01:09:16.441 --> 01:09:19.062
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they're making a movie for Cold Fear.

01:09:20.943 --> 01:09:23.125
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically a press release put out by

01:09:24.331 --> 01:09:42.961
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Works SA the leading French video game developer although I thought Ubisoft was the leading French video game developer but I could be wrong that they are I don't know they're putting out another movie that's going to probably be crap are they making it in French?

01:09:43.501 --> 01:09:43.941
[SPEAKER_05]: or what?

01:09:46.302 --> 01:09:52.946
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know to be honest I see video game movie for a game that I haven't played you know

01:09:55.256 --> 01:09:56.797
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:10:22.442 --> 01:10:30.830
[SPEAKER_01]: actually Kingdom Hearts 2 hit 2.5 million it's actually approaching 10 million in the world it's pretty cool huh

01:10:31.109 --> 01:10:33.210
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's a lot of sales.

01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:36.471
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but for Japan and North America, it topped 2.5 million.

01:10:36.611 --> 01:10:44.414
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 1.2 million for Japan since December 22nd and 1.3 million in North America since the 28th of last month.

01:10:46.555 --> 01:10:48.976
[SPEAKER_01]: This series worldwide has hit 8.5 million.

01:10:49.796 --> 01:10:54.498
[SPEAKER_01]: With the European release, they're expecting it to top 10 million.

01:10:55.878 --> 01:10:58.459
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, the numbers are well-deserved.

01:10:58.699 --> 01:11:00.440
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is a very well-done game.

01:11:01.069 --> 01:11:01.450
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

01:11:02.371 --> 01:11:04.115
[SPEAKER_05]: This game might sell that many copies.

01:11:04.535 --> 01:11:05.177
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

01:11:05.237 --> 01:11:10.847
[SPEAKER_05]: But Metroid Prime 3 is going to be the flagship title for Nintendo Revolution.

01:11:11.348 --> 01:11:11.568
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:11:12.438 --> 01:11:13.458
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what they're saying.

01:11:13.878 --> 01:11:18.959
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo is going to be showing this fully playable at the E3 Expo.

01:11:19.379 --> 01:11:28.581
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm wondering if it's not Metroid Prime 3 on GameCube, but with revolution enhancements, sort of like they're saying is going to happen with, or would be happening with Zelda.

01:11:28.841 --> 01:11:36.902
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a little more along the lines of what's really going on, is that Metroid Prime 3 is probably a GameCube game, but with revolution aspect to it.

01:11:36.942 --> 01:11:39.423
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be very interesting, because this game kind of...

01:11:40.223 --> 01:11:41.224
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:12:04.656 --> 01:12:05.436
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see what happens.

01:12:05.597 --> 01:12:06.597
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be an exciting title.

01:12:06.917 --> 01:12:12.341
[SPEAKER_05]: I really liked Metroid Prime 2 at last year's E3, but I never really... I mean, it's just my GameCube.

01:12:12.401 --> 01:12:13.121
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be honest.

01:12:13.201 --> 01:12:17.404
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't play it so much because there's not a lot of new titles I get really excited about on GameCube anymore.

01:12:17.904 --> 01:12:18.684
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe with the Zelda.

01:12:18.704 --> 01:12:19.005
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

01:12:19.825 --> 01:12:21.286
[SPEAKER_05]: One more story for this segment, Loki.

01:12:22.166 --> 01:12:22.507
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:12:23.227 --> 01:12:31.332
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you thought that you couldn't whore Burger King enough in 360 games, well, you're wrong.

01:12:32.092 --> 01:12:33.273
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to actually make their own

01:12:33.869 --> 01:12:35.050
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360 games.

01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:36.811
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

01:12:37.011 --> 01:12:42.814
[SPEAKER_03]: Burger King is going to be making games for the 360 and Xbox.

01:12:42.894 --> 01:12:48.178
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they will be Xbox games that will be fully compatible with the 360 that we're going to be selling for $3.69.

01:12:48.478 --> 01:12:55.362
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sure these will be top shelf games, too.

01:12:55.422 --> 01:13:02.306
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be buying them with your Angus Cheesy Bacon Steakburger, which I might add, by the way, isn't very good.

01:13:03.049 --> 01:13:03.669
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a very good game.

01:13:04.129 --> 01:13:08.010
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have three games that are going to be coming out, very appropriately deemed.

01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:10.510
[SPEAKER_03]: Action, Fighting, and Racing.

01:13:11.471 --> 01:13:21.613
[SPEAKER_03]: The action game, they're comparing it to Halo or Destroy All Humans, which will probably turn out more like Wolfenstein 3D.

01:13:21.633 --> 01:13:28.154
[SPEAKER_03]: The fighting game is supposed to be combining elements of Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat.

01:13:31.277 --> 01:13:31.817
[SPEAKER_03]: That's excellent.

01:13:32.418 --> 01:13:33.639
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's the king gonna fight?

01:13:33.699 --> 01:13:34.799
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know the king would be in it.

01:13:34.819 --> 01:13:35.440
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's he gonna fight?

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:36.020
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:36.741
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

01:13:37.541 --> 01:13:42.685
[SPEAKER_05]: The evil... He could fight... He could beat the shit out of Hamburglar and Ronald McDonald and I think they might have problems with that.

01:13:43.105 --> 01:14:00.077
[SPEAKER_03]: And racing is basically gonna be combining... Or they said it's very comparable to Need for Speed or Forza, which I'd laugh... They do have some... Or I should say Kotaku posted some screenshots or I guess...

01:14:01.806 --> 01:14:02.166
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:14:02.386 --> 01:14:03.486
[SPEAKER_05]: Internal documents or something?

01:14:03.546 --> 01:14:06.967
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that of concept art, I guess.

01:14:07.027 --> 01:14:08.908
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard they got in a little bit of hot water.

01:14:09.228 --> 01:14:10.108
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

01:14:10.408 --> 01:14:12.369
[SPEAKER_03]: But the screenshots are hilarious.

01:14:12.509 --> 01:14:17.430
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like one that's looking like the king's trying to give a hamburger to some prostitute.

01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:20.211
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one where the king... Is that for real?

01:14:20.251 --> 01:14:20.711
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

01:14:20.731 --> 01:14:22.511
[SPEAKER_05]: This shit has joke written all over it.

01:14:22.551 --> 01:14:24.052
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a commercial or something.

01:14:24.412 --> 01:14:25.332
[SPEAKER_05]: Marketing campaign.

01:14:25.852 --> 01:14:28.173
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know, but... You know...

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:31.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Sikoon suggests World of BurgerCraft

01:14:46.886 --> 01:14:47.486
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be fun.

01:14:47.886 --> 01:14:48.246
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

01:14:48.587 --> 01:14:50.807
[SPEAKER_05]: Ota G says, Burger Combat!

01:14:51.388 --> 01:14:52.868
[SPEAKER_05]: Plays a little music behind that, I'm sure.

01:14:53.688 --> 01:14:55.709
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Poo Eater says, Clerk Killer.

01:14:55.889 --> 01:15:00.551
[SPEAKER_05]: So the king could be fighting all the Burger King employees.

01:15:00.631 --> 01:15:01.431
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be exciting.

01:15:02.471 --> 01:15:02.811
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

01:15:04.732 --> 01:15:05.192
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you know what?

01:15:05.432 --> 01:15:07.073
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the BK Kids Club?

01:15:07.133 --> 01:15:08.573
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the BK Kids Club?

01:15:08.933 --> 01:15:10.734
[SPEAKER_05]: That's who the king needs to regulate on.

01:15:10.954 --> 01:15:11.594
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be fun.

01:15:11.754 --> 01:15:13.355
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kick-ass.

01:15:15.686 --> 01:15:17.408
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're gonna go to a break here.

01:15:17.428 --> 01:15:20.352
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back a little later on with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:21.132 --> 01:15:26.098
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

01:15:26.559 --> 01:15:30.864
