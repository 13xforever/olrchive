00:00.000 --> 00:20.120
Tonight, April 16th, 2006, PlayStation 2 considers a price drop, Xbox Live plans another free

00:20.120 --> 00:24.760
weekend, and a little story from some no-name website about Konami releases brings that

00:24.760 --> 00:35.720
site a lot of attention this week hello everybody out there welcome to orange

00:35.720 --> 00:41.920
lounge radio what gamers really want to know this is episode number 181 for this

00:41.920 --> 00:46.680
April the 16th 2006 my name is Rob Roberts but you might know me as sky

00:46.680 --> 00:52.480
joining me as always say hello to the lovely dark Sakura Jamie Summers hey how

00:52.480 --> 00:53.480
How are you doing?

00:53.480 --> 00:59.960
I always forget that you turn this thing off for me, so I will repeat, yo, what up?

00:59.960 --> 01:00.960
How are you doing?

01:00.960 --> 01:01.960
Feeling better this week?

01:01.960 --> 01:03.680
I am feeling better.

01:03.680 --> 01:04.680
It was very weird.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.240
I couldn't move.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.240
Last week?

01:07.240 --> 01:08.240
Last week.

01:08.240 --> 01:11.160
I literally couldn't move, so I had to give blood.

01:11.160 --> 01:16.440
You made quite the turnaround because you were out rocking out last night, right?

01:16.440 --> 01:19.740
I started feeling better by Monday, then Tuesday I felt a lot better, and Wednesday I was back

01:19.740 --> 01:20.740
at work.

01:20.740 --> 01:23.740
I even did my show on Tuesday, even though I said I wasn't gonna.

01:23.740 --> 01:28.740
Did you hear me joking in the last podcast that you were playing hooky so you could stay home and play Kingdom Hearts 2?

01:28.740 --> 01:34.740
You're not far off. No, I'm kidding. I actually did play a whole lot of Kingdom Hearts.

01:34.740 --> 01:37.740
You know, it was kind of one of those things when I was sick when I was a kid.

01:37.740 --> 01:40.740
My mom used to say, you're faking it so you can stay home and play video games.

01:40.740 --> 01:45.740
It's like, no, but as long as I'm gonna be home, I might as well make some good use of my time.

01:45.740 --> 01:48.740
People in the chatroom are saying I sound all stuffed up.

01:48.740 --> 01:54.340
That's slightly true because you notice springtime, and I have allergies, but it went in fact

01:54.340 --> 02:00.460
I was actually up until 4 30 a.m.. Because I went to see the most amazing live band ever

02:01.140 --> 02:04.460
Which was baby land I finally get to see baby land live

02:04.460 --> 02:11.460
I'm so happy because all the other bands were like suck suck more suck, and then the Mormons and this Ninja Academy

02:11.860 --> 02:14.100
8-bit was cool. We went outside

02:14.100 --> 02:19.520
outside, um, for, uh, I, cause I went with a guano girl and she went to go, uh, have

02:19.520 --> 02:23.080
a smoke and we were outside, while, while we were outside, this is video game related

02:23.080 --> 02:28.800
by the way, I hear this bass line, cause they're sort of like kind of weird rap, you know,

02:28.800 --> 02:33.660
group, but they're wearing hazmat suits too, but I hear this bass line that sounds familiar

02:33.660 --> 02:38.740
and it turns out that it's the Zelda music as a bass line.

02:38.740 --> 02:39.740
That's cool.

02:39.740 --> 02:42.840
It was pretty cool, I mean, I wouldn't listen to 8-Bit all the time, but their music was

02:42.840 --> 02:43.840
pretty cool.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.200
you get them on the show at some point?

02:45.200 --> 02:48.240
Maybe, but Babyland owned the stage.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.840
I was bouncing and jumping, and we get out of there

02:51.840 --> 02:52.480
at like 1.30.

02:52.480 --> 02:57.880
I get home at 3.30, and of course I date my LiveJournal.

02:57.880 --> 02:58.720
Like a true addict.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.560
Like a true addict.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.280
I have photos.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.600
I will be sharing photos with our chat room tonight.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.400
But it was probably the best time, I think,

03:07.400 --> 03:08.800
I've ever had at a live show.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.760
And so as a result, I'm kind of in grog mode today.

03:12.760 --> 03:17.760
We went to our Easter brunch that Dan and a bunch of us

03:17.800 --> 03:19.360
do every Easter.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.980
Happy Easter to our listeners, by the way,

03:20.980 --> 03:21.820
if you celebrate it.

03:21.820 --> 03:23.120
If not, happy Sunday.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.720
Easter is a brunch day.

03:27.380 --> 03:29.160
And over there is Loki, who's just waiting

03:29.160 --> 03:30.000
to make a comment.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.640
Say hello to Tech Master Loki, also here.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.980
Hi, I was gonna say Rabbit and Ham Day.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.360
All right.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.520
Anyway, usually we start off the show

03:39.520 --> 03:41.500
doing a little bit of how was your gaming week,

03:41.500 --> 03:45.860
But there's just one story that really caught our attention this week that we have to talk

03:45.860 --> 03:47.380
about this first thing.

03:47.380 --> 03:52.320
It's just such an interesting story that we have to kick off the show with this tonight.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.940
And so we're going to head over to GameSpot because GameSpot ran an article this week

03:55.940 --> 03:57.780
that I thought was very interesting.

03:57.780 --> 04:05.780
Leaked Konami Schedule Reveals New DS Castlevania and PSP Silent Hill?

04:05.780 --> 04:16.260
The source is self-styled online radio station, Orange Lounge Radio.

04:16.260 --> 04:20.940
The official story, apparently Konami reps had not returned requests for comment on this.

04:20.940 --> 04:23.460
Ooh, sounds pretty interesting.

04:23.460 --> 04:26.500
I'm calling April Fools!

04:26.500 --> 04:28.600
I think they're lying.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.240
They're absolutely lying.

04:30.240 --> 04:33.020
Let's see, what they heard, I'm not going to read the whole thing, if you want to check

04:33.020 --> 04:35.580
it out you can go over to GameSpot.com.

04:35.580 --> 04:40.540
Given that its primary focus is Konami's beat-matching series of games such as the popular games

04:40.540 --> 04:44.740
Dance Dance Revolution and Beatmania, there's no question Orange Lounge Radio has its collective

04:44.740 --> 04:48.620
eye on Konami.

04:48.620 --> 04:55.440
So despite the site's low profile, people took notice this week when it crowed that

04:55.440 --> 05:00.220
it had uncovered a slew of unannounced games and ship dates courtesy of a leaked list Konami

05:00.220 --> 05:02.280
had sent to retailers.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.060
So that's the first small correction we need to make, right?

05:05.060 --> 05:07.040
Wasn't this a distributor thing or a retailer thing?

05:07.040 --> 05:08.040
What was this?

05:08.040 --> 05:09.040
It was both.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.040
Huh?

05:10.040 --> 05:13.680
They basically send it to anybody who sells games, we'd probably get some sort of information

05:13.680 --> 05:14.680
like this.

05:14.680 --> 05:15.680
Very interesting.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.680
Blah, blah, blah.

05:16.680 --> 05:22.040
They talk about the titles that this website decided to announce, DDR Supernova is going

05:22.040 --> 05:28.080
to happen on September 13th, Dance Dance Revolution Universe on October 11th, DDR Ultra Mix 4

05:28.080 --> 05:32.240
on November 14th, Castlevania Portrait of Ruin on November 15th.

05:32.240 --> 05:43.020
By the way, that's Portrait of Ruin and then PSP Silent Hill Original Sin on October 18th.

05:43.020 --> 05:46.100
Although very interesting because I seem to recall this website had a giant disclaimer

05:46.100 --> 05:53.620
that said all these dates are subject to change as release dates always do.

05:53.620 --> 05:57.540
And then of course two new Death Junior games, but people don't seem to care as much about

05:57.540 --> 05:58.540
those.

05:58.540 --> 06:00.820
And then I thought this was interesting too.

06:00.820 --> 06:05.400
This list also promises a potentially very lucrative tie-in for Konami.

06:05.400 --> 06:09.500
According to Orange Launch Radio, the list has Karaoke Revolution American Idol arriving

06:09.500 --> 06:11.340
in stores on November 15th.

06:11.340 --> 06:15.500
If true, the game would be the second one based on the mega-popular television series

06:15.500 --> 06:19.220
after Codemaster's dismally-reviewed 2003 game.

06:19.220 --> 06:23.400
Never mind that Konami already announced back in October that they were going to do the

06:23.400 --> 06:28.020
American Idol franchise, I know because we covered it on this program, but you know,

06:28.020 --> 06:29.020
it still is a rumor.

06:29.020 --> 06:30.020
It's a dirty rumor.

06:30.020 --> 06:32.020
Who actually listens to us?

06:32.020 --> 06:36.020
I forgot. Nobody knows of Orange Lawn's Radio. They've been low-key for the past few years.

06:36.020 --> 06:44.020
Alright. No, seriously, I'm picking on these guys over at GameSpot, but I think, actually, this is one of the more well-written articles on the whole thing.

06:44.020 --> 06:46.020
I wonder what that hunk of plastic on my mantle is.

06:46.020 --> 06:47.020
What?

06:47.020 --> 06:49.020
The podcast award.

06:49.020 --> 06:55.020
Oh, oh yeah, yeah. Never mind the podcast award. Never mind that we've actually been doing this for the past, you know, four years almost.

06:55.020 --> 06:58.020
Next month it'll have been four years that we've been doing Orange Lawn's Radio.

06:58.020 --> 07:02.020
But somehow, that whole time, we've managed to be low-key.

07:02.020 --> 07:05.020
So our long-time fans, you know, you've been a part of something for a long time.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.020
I've always been low-key.

07:06.020 --> 07:08.020
Yeah, you've always been low-key.

07:08.020 --> 07:12.020
You know, I'm short, so I'm pretty low to the ground.

07:12.020 --> 07:15.020
No, we don't have delusions of grandeur.

07:15.020 --> 07:18.020
We know that this site has always been an underground, independent thing.

07:18.020 --> 07:22.020
So we're saying this very tongue-in-cheek about this whole underground thing.

07:22.020 --> 07:25.020
We know that, you know, we got a lot of attention this week.

07:25.020 --> 07:29.020
But the question is, did we really deserve it?

07:29.020 --> 07:32.020
I mean, were any of these titles really a surprise to anybody?

07:32.020 --> 07:33.020
No.

07:33.020 --> 07:36.020
I mean, Castlevania was such a kick-ass game on the DS.

07:36.020 --> 07:39.020
Of course there was going to be another DS game coming.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.020
The Silent Hill remake has been running...

07:41.020 --> 07:44.020
That was a rumor. Like, we covered that three weeks ago.

07:44.020 --> 07:48.020
They talked about, well, they were going to make, other than, you know,

07:48.020 --> 07:52.020
the Silent Hill experience, they were going to be doing a PSP game anyway.

07:52.020 --> 07:53.020
So it's like, okay.

07:53.020 --> 07:57.200
Okay, and there was a speculation given from some other commentary about

07:58.000 --> 08:00.400
them remaking based on the movie

08:01.180 --> 08:06.300
Remaking the first game based on the movie and of course DDR is going to have home release

08:06.300 --> 08:11.420
They're not gonna release it at home. I'm sorry never mind the fact that when they were advertising supernova

08:11.420 --> 08:15.300
They said that it's gonna have some connectivity to home versions

08:16.140 --> 08:20.980
Duh, I mean obviously there's got to be a new home version coming out, so I don't know

08:20.980 --> 08:22.980
Do we really deserve all this notoriety?

08:22.980 --> 08:26.100
Why do people care so much about this story?

08:26.100 --> 08:28.460
Because people like release dates.

08:28.460 --> 08:32.100
Even though release dates are always subject to change.

08:32.100 --> 08:33.940
Exactly, they're always subject to change.

08:33.940 --> 08:39.300
So by the time we get down to it, well, to be honest, the DDR releases I'm not too surprised

08:39.300 --> 08:43.500
on because they release DDR about the same time every year.

08:43.500 --> 08:49.580
You get the Xbox version sometime in November, usually the first half, and the PS2 version

08:49.580 --> 08:51.060
sometime in september

08:51.060 --> 08:53.000
so it's it's the same time every year

08:53.000 --> 08:56.820
well i found the whole fall out over the story very fascinating i think the part

08:56.820 --> 09:00.580
that fascinated me most wasn't the notoriety itself because i understand

09:00.580 --> 09:02.580
people care about silent hill in castlevania

09:02.580 --> 09:05.460
and ddr they've got all three of them have very rabid fan bases but what

09:05.460 --> 09:06.940
surprised me

09:06.940 --> 09:10.740
was the reaction on the internet out there to these stories it's really funny

09:10.740 --> 09:14.680
because when ddr freaked bamani style those sites picked up the story

09:14.680 --> 09:16.300
it was reported as fact

09:16.300 --> 09:20.660
but when other sites bigger name sites pick this up it was reported as

09:20.660 --> 09:24.340
rumor which I thought was very very interesting and you bring up a good

09:24.340 --> 09:24.700
point

09:24.700 --> 09:28.260
are people just upset that we beat them to it? I don't know

09:28.260 --> 09:32.700
but now remind us Loki where did this come from it's just a list that goes out

09:32.700 --> 09:33.060
this

09:33.060 --> 09:37.100
came in okay this information got sent to our buyer

09:37.100 --> 09:40.660
the person that you know maintains our item database

09:40.660 --> 09:44.780
this was sent to us and entered into our item database

09:44.780 --> 09:47.860
I merely get a report every now and then when

09:47.860 --> 09:51.020
they change dates. It's basically a date change report

09:51.020 --> 09:57.260
and I notice Bomberman Act Zero, Xbox 360 and PSP. I'm like, hey, I didn't know that was on the PSP.

09:57.260 --> 10:01.580
So I really quickly, I'm like, oh wait, Konami's putting that out? I didn't know that.

10:01.580 --> 10:05.080
So I just, you know, real quickly looked in there and I'm like, okay, let's see what

10:05.080 --> 10:09.220
we got for the rest of the year here. All of a sudden I see all of Konami's games on there. I'm like,

10:09.220 --> 10:14.260
well, hey, this is interesting. Usually though, when I see stuff like this, for example, I've been

10:14.260 --> 10:18.100
saying karaoke revolution country. We saw this before

10:18.100 --> 10:22.060
um, you know, Konami gamers day and usually I don't

10:22.060 --> 10:26.460
try to go out and post this stuff because I don't really find the announcement

10:26.460 --> 10:29.580
of release dates that important. For example, there's games like

10:29.580 --> 10:33.140
commando strike force. It's been delayed by a whole friggin year.

10:33.140 --> 10:36.640
This game was slated for 2004 and

10:36.640 --> 10:40.700
or 2005 and it finally came out, you know, just last week or so.

10:40.700 --> 10:45.420
So, I don't know, release dates to me are not really a big deal, but

10:45.420 --> 10:48.740
I just thought it was interesting because there's a lot of these games that we knew

10:48.740 --> 10:50.380
were coming out anyways

10:50.380 --> 10:54.140
and now that we had dates, it's kinda making it more official. Also kinda gives you an

10:54.140 --> 10:55.580
idea what they're gonna be showing at

10:55.580 --> 10:59.100
E3 this year. Wait, hold on, I thought you were gonna say some more stuff. Hold that

10:59.100 --> 10:59.940
thought for a minute though.

10:59.940 --> 11:03.340
No. Because, okay, here's the interesting thing because

11:03.340 --> 11:06.780
what I thought was interesting about the reaction is that people didn't believe

11:06.780 --> 11:08.020
it when it was on our site,

11:08.020 --> 11:14.100
But, when somebody else, one of the big name sites reported it, then it was validated.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.820
It was true.

11:15.820 --> 11:17.120
Guess what guys?

11:17.120 --> 11:23.260
Those big sites all copied from our list and here's the proof.

11:23.260 --> 11:28.860
The proof is that when these websites ran a story that said Konami leaked information

11:28.860 --> 11:31.580
or whatever, they listed the same dates we did.

11:31.580 --> 11:35.580
But what we didn't tell you was, Loki only posted the games he thought you'd want to

11:35.580 --> 11:36.580
know about, right?

11:36.580 --> 11:37.580
Exactly.

11:37.580 --> 11:42.260
A website that would have found this about Konami games would have picked up the other

11:42.900 --> 11:48.100
Lower name titles that maybe we didn't think you originally wanted to know about but now after all this fear

11:48.100 --> 11:51.820
We we guess you do want to know about yeah, so Loki. What are some other?

11:52.340 --> 11:54.340
Konami games that were on this list

11:54.740 --> 11:56.140
for example

11:56.140 --> 12:00.680
Rengoku 2 you know it's really sad as I actually played Rengoku last e3

12:00.860 --> 12:04.620
I actually brought it with me on my PSP, and I love this game except

12:04.620 --> 12:06.660
But it was really boring.

12:06.660 --> 12:11.020
But for whatever reason, Rengoku 2 is coming out on July 12th, that's what it's slated

12:11.020 --> 12:12.020
for right now.

12:12.020 --> 12:13.020
About the same time I...

12:13.020 --> 12:16.820
No, actually I think Rengoku came out later than that last year.

12:16.820 --> 12:17.820
Anyways.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.940
Yeah, okay game I guess.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.980
God damn screensaver.

12:21.980 --> 12:23.860
I fucking hate these stupid...

12:23.860 --> 12:26.020
That's why you turn them off.

12:26.020 --> 12:27.460
But I like the fishies.

12:27.460 --> 12:31.420
Anyways, on top of that, we've also got...

12:31.420 --> 12:35.100
Let's see here, if you're a Yu-Gi-Oh fan there's going to be lots of stuff for you. You got

12:35.100 --> 12:42.820
Yu-Gi-Oh GX Tag Force coming out on the PSP, that's on November 15th. Xialin Showdown,

12:42.820 --> 12:47.260
which is apparently based on some anime show that's I think on the WB or whatever, coming

12:47.260 --> 12:57.140
out on Playstation 2, Xbox, PSP, and I think DS. And that one's coming out on November

12:57.140 --> 13:05.620
15th. Um, online chess kingdoms, PSP. I am so looking forward to that! Uh, also November

13:05.620 --> 13:12.620
15th. Um. Nerd. Winx Club quest for codex. We are the Winx, we are the Winx. God, I hate

13:12.620 --> 13:15.940
the Winx. That was last year's E3 for me, standing in Konami's booth jamming to that

13:15.940 --> 13:22.100
Winx song. That you know that song? Frightens me? It's stuck in my head from last year's

13:22.100 --> 13:25.300
C3 being at that booth. It's an infectious song, don't ask me.

13:25.300 --> 13:30.660
Yeah, well anyways, Winx Club Quest for Codex, that's going to be coming out, looks like

13:30.660 --> 13:36.860
October 25th, along with Steel Horizon on the PSP, which I believe is a naval warfare

13:36.860 --> 13:40.660
game. Then there's a Marvel trading card game, to be honest I don't...

13:40.660 --> 13:42.140
Is this all Konami? It's all Konami.

13:42.140 --> 13:44.580
Dang. Marvel trading card games coming out on the

13:44.580 --> 13:50.500
PSP, and I want to say the DS, so that should be interesting. I guess they're trying to,

13:50.500 --> 13:56.260
You know, I guess since Yu-Gi-Oh is popular, we're trying some other stuff here.

13:56.260 --> 14:01.260
And I want to say, I think, you know, Gradius Collections coming out next month, June 14th,

14:01.260 --> 14:09.940
but I knew that for a while, Demon Chaos coming out next month, Lunar Knights Vampire Hunt

14:09.940 --> 14:14.700
is going to be coming out November 15th.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.300
And I think that's about it.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.660
Wake me up when we get a Goemon game.

14:18.660 --> 14:24.540
Now what I think is interesting about this is that if anybody from Konami is listening

14:24.540 --> 14:26.860
and is ticked off about this, please don't be.

14:26.860 --> 14:30.100
We're just repeating information that's already been put out there into the retailers

14:30.100 --> 14:33.520
and we figure well since retailers know about this, maybe the gamers want to know about

14:33.520 --> 14:34.520
this too.

14:34.520 --> 14:39.860
It's the same thing like when other websites post a goddamn list from GameStop.

14:39.860 --> 14:44.560
Those are internal lists that they actually scan in and throw online, so I don't feel

14:44.560 --> 14:45.900
too bad to be honest.

14:45.900 --> 14:49.620
And to lessen the blow a little bit, do you have anything from another game company that

14:49.620 --> 14:50.620
people might want to know about?

14:50.620 --> 14:52.620
Hell yeah, we do.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.620
Anyways, no.

14:54.620 --> 14:58.180
Let's take a look-see here, some stuff maybe later on this year.

14:58.180 --> 15:06.580
For example, there was some games, actually they announced Open Season I think this week

15:06.580 --> 15:10.600
as well, that was one of the ones that's going to be based on I think a DreamWorks movie

15:10.600 --> 15:15.580
or something like that, some animated movie about animals getting back at hunters or something.

15:15.580 --> 15:18.940
But that's coming out in the fall.

15:18.940 --> 15:23.660
I do have, what was it, oh what was a really cool one here.

15:23.660 --> 15:26.860
Oh here's one.

15:26.860 --> 15:27.860
Nintendo DS.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.420
SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighter.

15:30.420 --> 15:34.180
It's going to be coming out on, looks like October 2nd.

15:34.180 --> 15:36.700
Hey, that's awesome.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.340
Because I have that on Neo Geo pocket color five years ago.

15:39.340 --> 15:40.740
Can I see the big list here?

15:40.740 --> 15:44.140
Because I remember there were some games on here I thought were very very interesting.

15:44.140 --> 15:50.040
I remember seeing distinctly when I looked at this Disgaea 2, I want to say that was

15:50.040 --> 16:00.040
August, let's see PS2, Disgaea 2, August 30th, I had a guy that used to buy thousands of

16:00.040 --> 16:06.100
these things, Cartoon Network Racing, October 18th, hey there's Dance Factory, that game's

16:06.100 --> 16:11.360
been delayed forever, yeah it sucked, a game based on the movie Cars, is that what that

16:11.360 --> 16:16.440
is on June 7th there um yeah that that's no what was that Naruto I bet a lot of

16:16.440 --> 16:20.000
our listeners that like anime one about that they actually are bringing out the

16:20.000 --> 16:22.960
because I I've known about this for a little while they're bringing out one of

16:22.960 --> 16:29.320
the last Naruto games Naruto ultimate ninja that's coming out June 21st what

16:29.320 --> 16:33.760
was a really cool funny one I saw here and the people might not know about you

16:33.760 --> 16:39.040
ps2 Yakuza is coming out September 13th I know that was one that was pretty cool

16:39.040 --> 16:42.760
I'm trying to think of some really cool stuff.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.760
What's coming out way later in the year there?

16:44.760 --> 16:47.280
I wish this was in order here.

16:47.280 --> 16:50.120
Oh, there's a bunch of 360 games.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.800
Dead Rising, I think the date's wrong on that though.

16:52.800 --> 16:57.440
I think it got postponed, we haven't updated it yet.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.920
Over-G Fighters, that looks kind of cool.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.000
Over-G Fighters is June 8th there?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.040
Yeah, June 8th, that's...

17:04.040 --> 17:05.520
Splinter Cell, Double Agent?

17:05.520 --> 17:06.520
I remember.

17:06.520 --> 17:10.220
Yeah, they got postponed a while back because they didn't think there was enough systems

17:10.220 --> 17:11.220
out there.

17:11.220 --> 17:17.160
Snoopy vs. the Red Baron going on October, or not October, August 16th.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.960
We covered that one.

17:18.960 --> 17:19.960
Yeah, I know.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.720
Alright, so there you have it.

17:21.720 --> 17:26.080
There's, and this stuff is all, you know, subject to change, I mean, a lot of stuff

17:26.080 --> 17:32.160
they announce way in advance and gets pushed back and back and back and back and, yeah.

17:32.160 --> 17:36.440
But I don't know, there's some good stuff.

17:36.440 --> 17:46.240
Mega Man ZX coming out September 13th on the Game Boy Advance.

17:46.240 --> 17:49.800
So yeah, lots of exciting stuff.

17:49.800 --> 17:55.680
More of course coming from E3, granted we might see stuff at E3 that wasn't on the Konami

17:55.680 --> 17:56.680
list.

17:56.680 --> 17:57.680
Oh, absolutely.

17:57.680 --> 17:58.680
I'm sure there will be.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.880
For example, we don't have any Revolution or

18:01.880 --> 18:05.680
PS3 titles in here yet. And there was nothing on a Metal Gear 4, right?

18:05.680 --> 18:08.880
Which, you know, we know Konami's planning but they don't have a date for it yet

18:08.880 --> 18:10.360
obviously. Exactly. So

18:10.360 --> 18:13.680
lots of stuff coming and, you know,

18:13.680 --> 18:17.160
one, I'll just keep an eye out on these dates, you know, if we see anything good

18:17.160 --> 18:18.680
I'll definitely

18:18.680 --> 18:23.600
you know, keep guys up to date on this stuff. Alright, sounds great.

18:23.600 --> 18:27.100
Our Skype line is open if anyone wants to give us a call.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.780
most specifically about this topic here is what we want you guys's feedback on

18:30.780 --> 18:32.660
kinda what do you think about this whole

18:32.660 --> 18:35.060
news story do you think we're full of crap

18:35.060 --> 18:38.540
uh... which i hope by this point you don't but if you do it and say so will

18:38.540 --> 18:40.340
you know offer our witty retorts

18:40.340 --> 18:44.200
uh... do you think that did we really three

18:44.200 --> 18:47.820
i hope i don't think we don't think we don't like free three to be honest if

18:47.820 --> 18:50.460
anything this

18:50.460 --> 18:54.060
who out there i mean other than probably a size actually no goes the e three

18:54.060 --> 18:54.860
looking

18:54.860 --> 18:59.100
to see what Konami is putting out. I mean I know everybody's interested in all the companies

18:59.100 --> 19:03.380
and stuff, but I mean the big focus this year is going to be PS3 Revolution. I think the

19:03.380 --> 19:11.300
fact that we put out the dates, maybe if anything, kind of helped. I don't know. It's only two

19:11.300 --> 19:16.220
weeks away. I mean it's like, you know, it's not a huge spoiler.

19:16.220 --> 19:22.200
Alright, so no calls coming out on the Skype line right now, but our chat room is kind

19:22.200 --> 19:26.400
of a buzz here over at www.orangelandtrady.com, click on chat.

19:26.400 --> 19:36.280
We have Rama says Naruto GameCube sucks, Naruto PS2 owns, or I should say pwns so to speak.

19:36.280 --> 19:40.360
Dark Knight wants to know, oh my god they are going to port the Neo Geo Pocket game,

19:40.360 --> 19:44.280
I wonder if that's in reference to the Capcom SNK card game there.

19:44.280 --> 19:50.940
Naruto 2 is coming out on GameCube October 18th, oh it should be fun.

19:50.940 --> 19:56.760
So you guys, if you guys want to comment on there, www.orangelaungeradio.com and click

19:56.760 --> 19:57.760
on chat.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.380
Here's one I was interested in.

19:59.380 --> 20:04.380
September 13th, only a couple days after my birthday, Power Stone Collection for the PSP.

20:04.380 --> 20:06.060
Here's another thing you might not have known.

20:06.060 --> 20:11.140
Test Drive Unlimited, you know the 360 games, actually coming out on the current gen stuff

20:11.140 --> 20:12.140
as well.

20:12.140 --> 20:16.820
They're reporting it to PSP, PS2, Xbox.

20:16.820 --> 20:17.820
Awesome.

20:17.820 --> 20:20.700
Alright, sounds pretty good.

20:20.700 --> 20:25.380
All right, well since it looks like people are being shy in our chat room right now

20:25.380 --> 20:26.580
I want not want to give us a call

20:26.580 --> 20:31.300
We'll we'll open up skype line a little later for other topics if you guys want to call in and talk about that

20:31.300 --> 20:36.920
But for now, we'll go ahead and move on and talk about our gaming week how we usually start off the show

20:37.960 --> 20:42.360
Dark Sakura, what have you been playing this week Kingdom Hearts and lots of it. Oh

20:43.620 --> 20:48.420
My god, I played just like I was so in a hurry to get past all the rocks

20:48.420 --> 20:52.860
Roxas crap that when I did I just was her like okay that's a relief and then

20:52.860 --> 20:59.780
I played like for hours and I got past the space paranoid part earlier in the

20:59.780 --> 21:03.620
week I waited on that said that Dan could see it because he he's also a big

21:03.620 --> 21:09.580
Tron fan and then I did the thousand heartless battle today I hear that's a

21:09.580 --> 21:13.980
fun part of the game it actually is but it's a pain in the ass cuz what's his

21:13.980 --> 21:20.260
face the guitar boy he's he's a pain in the ass to beat but yeah I had a I've

21:20.260 --> 21:24.700
been playing a lot of that and not really much else just because you know

21:24.700 --> 21:28.860
it puts me back in couch potato mode and I played like a little bit of Ragnarok

21:28.860 --> 21:34.380
was like I don't really feel like trying to get to level 50 today so that's

21:34.380 --> 21:38.060
really been about all I've been playing is lots and lots and lots and lots and

21:38.060 --> 21:41.660
lots and lots of Kingdom Hearts all right I hear it's I hear it's a very

21:41.660 --> 21:44.340
time consuming game.

21:44.340 --> 21:48.380
I haven't touched my copy in a week, I feel bad, but I need to get back into that because

21:48.380 --> 21:49.640
it was a really fun game.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.980
You're playing that dirty Final Fantasy 11.

21:52.980 --> 21:55.180
I have been playing that dirty Final Fantasy 11.

21:55.180 --> 21:58.140
Since Dark Soccer threw it over to me, I'll talk about my game of the week.

21:58.140 --> 22:02.440
I've been playing that dirty, dirty Final Fantasy 11 in preparation for the Xbox version

22:02.440 --> 22:04.780
and the new expansion that's coming out this week.

22:04.780 --> 22:06.800
Pretty excited about that.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.540
I did switch servers a while ago, trying out a new server.

22:09.540 --> 22:13.880
I'm playing on seraph is the server I'm playing on and I am not sky on seraph

22:13.880 --> 22:19.600
I picked a different name because you know, I just wanted I wanted some anonymity on playing Final Fantasy 11

22:20.320 --> 22:23.640
But there is a sky on there, but she's it's a she and it's not me

22:23.640 --> 22:25.200
I have a different name on there

22:25.200 --> 22:30.880
But I ran into a lot of really nice people on that server and and some people that are helping me level my way to

22:30.880 --> 22:35.440
Level 30 so I can get some of those advanced jobs because I kind of want to be a puppet master in Final Fantasy 11

22:35.440 --> 22:39.080
That'll rock as far as other games. I've been playing a whole lot of new stuff

22:39.080 --> 22:42.080
I ordered Beatmania 2DX night style

22:42.920 --> 22:45.280
Like last week and I finally got it this week

22:45.280 --> 22:50.160
so I've been playing a little bit of that beat mania's release here in the USA really got me back into playing that and

22:51.360 --> 22:58.660
Outside of that. I also decided to download mutant storm reloaded the game on xbox live arcade after seeing it at Loki's house the other day and

22:59.160 --> 23:05.680
It's it's interesting because it's very similar geometry wars, but it's not it's like the stages aren't all that same square

23:05.680 --> 23:10.580
and it's it's a pretty game but not in the same way it's it's very sci-fi

23:10.580 --> 23:14.560
looking and like you know pulsing cells and all that kind of look and it's

23:14.560 --> 23:21.600
pretty fun I I think geometry wars is a little more fast-paced and really you

23:21.600 --> 23:25.320
have to be a lot quicker the mutant storm but mutant storm is a fun game but

23:25.320 --> 23:29.960
what I think kind of hurts mutant storm is that geometry war is only five bucks

23:29.960 --> 23:34.800
mutant storm is all is ten bucks so you know there you have it however mutant

23:34.800 --> 23:39.540
Storm to give it a little credit. It does have some additional modes, it has a two-player

23:39.540 --> 23:43.800
mode which Geometry Wars doesn't, but you can't do it on Xbox Live, so keep that in

23:43.800 --> 23:49.360
mind. And so it's got a little bit more to it, but I don't know if it's $5 worth when

23:49.360 --> 23:54.160
you consider that such a great game like Geometry Wars is only $5. And that pretty much does

23:54.160 --> 23:58.540
it for my gaming week. I mean Final Fantasy XI eats up a lot of my time. I have other

23:58.540 --> 24:03.600
games that I'm waiting to try, like Spike brought some games that he wanted me to try

24:03.600 --> 24:08.160
out and I got a copy of Oblivion but for the computer and I want to be checking

24:08.160 --> 24:12.560
that out pretty soon as well so one of my friends let me borrow his copy of

24:12.560 --> 24:17.600
Oblivion so I'll be good I wanted to add something what's that I really really

24:17.600 --> 24:21.480
hate the little mermaid levels I heard the little mermaid levels are I hope

24:21.480 --> 24:26.640
this is a spoiler but I heard they're a little bit beat matching yeah it's like

24:26.640 --> 24:31.600
you have to hit the button on the fourth beat you know to trigger whatever but

24:31.600 --> 24:36.420
The first one sucks, and then I went back and listened to it again in Japanese and the Japanese version sucks, too

24:37.000 --> 24:40.600
There's only like two good songs in the whole undersea part

24:43.280 --> 24:49.800
Mini me 283 says I love that penny arcade comic about Kingdom Hearts 2. I didn't I unfortunately didn't see that one

24:49.800 --> 24:54.560
I was hoping maybe you'd seen it. Yes. I have it's Winnie the Pooh merging with Sephiroth. Oh wait

24:54.560 --> 24:57.840
I didn't see that I did yeah, I did see that. Oh, it's funny

24:57.840 --> 25:01.520
So Sepiros in this one too?

25:01.520 --> 25:04.880
Yeah and he's not what's-his-face anymore.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.400
Lance Bass from NSYNC? Yeah, but

25:08.400 --> 25:12.000
whoever is Aerith sounds like she's stoned.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.720
Uh, Manus Avari from American Beauty. She sucks. I don't like her in that.

25:16.720 --> 25:20.000
And she's gonna be her in Advent Children. I would have rather had Mandy Moore in

25:20.000 --> 25:20.880
that saying something.

25:20.880 --> 25:25.560
But she's like, oh, I'm on drugs.

25:25.560 --> 25:29.560
Want to get high?

25:29.560 --> 25:31.560
Loki, what have you been playing this week?

25:31.560 --> 25:35.560
Well, I've been playing Mutant Storm Reloaded. I played that last night.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.560
And that was fun.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.560
I'm getting tangled here.

25:39.560 --> 25:42.560
And I was also playing more Oblivion.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.560
And that's really cool.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.560
And I'm cheating. That's even better.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.560
I did an item dupe.

25:49.560 --> 25:52.560
So I have all the Uber stuff now.

25:52.560 --> 25:58.880
stuff now. It was kind of neat though, I got this really magic enhanced katana and I took

25:58.880 --> 26:05.400
off someone's head with it and it was cool. I tried to kill a horse and people didn't

26:05.400 --> 26:12.400
like that very much. But, what else? I played Realm of Roses XX and...

26:13.520 --> 26:18.440
I had been playing with the photo taking mode?

26:18.440 --> 26:21.840
No, I did create a character though and it looked pretty cool.

26:21.840 --> 26:26.000
You don't get much to start off with, but it's really neat how they do the different...

26:26.000 --> 26:30.360
how customizable it is. I did make a character that looked like

26:30.360 --> 26:35.120
Ms. Swan from Mad TV. I was gonna say you were telling me about Ms. Swan. I wish you could have seen this.

26:35.120 --> 26:38.040
That was hilarious.

26:38.040 --> 26:41.080
Actually, the Ms. Swan character,

26:41.080 --> 26:45.040
all you have to do is basically take the default character that they give you and

26:45.040 --> 26:47.680
just make her fat and she looks like Ms. Swan.

26:47.680 --> 26:51.680
so I don't know and then

26:51.680 --> 26:56.300
what else did I do I actually apparently

26:56.300 --> 27:00.920
I played Mario Kart GP I can't tell you anything about it

27:00.920 --> 27:05.320
because I don't remember yes Loki's bachelor party was last night and as

27:05.320 --> 27:08.360
part of it he got to go to golf land to play some drunken miniature golf and some

27:08.360 --> 27:10.040
drunken Mario Kart I was there

27:10.040 --> 27:13.920
I filmed it and I think it's going to be going up on the website at some point or

27:13.920 --> 27:15.880
maybe the MySpace or something I don't know

27:15.880 --> 27:21.320
We'll have to put it somewhere on one of those sites so we still need more people on our myspace

27:21.320 --> 27:24.640
So maybe we ought to put it over there. We'll put it on both put it on YouTube. It's

27:26.320 --> 27:27.760
The whole

27:27.760 --> 27:31.580
Drunken a-hole from no-name site plays Mario Kart drunk

27:32.320 --> 27:37.520
It was great. I think the best part was you know how Mario Kart arcade will take your picture

27:38.040 --> 27:44.000
Before you start playing the picture that you did was so friggin hilarious. I can't even describe it

27:44.000 --> 27:47.620
you guys are gonna have to wait for the video it's great I'm converting the

27:47.620 --> 27:54.020
video tonight Jeremy Todd one says put it on olrpsp.com so yeah we're definitely

27:54.020 --> 28:00.680
going to be doing that yeah the 23rd magus says we need a drunk show I hate

28:00.680 --> 28:03.680
to tell you but probably not gonna happen for a little while gonna be

28:03.680 --> 28:08.140
somewhere during our next three-day weekend yeah oh yeah next the next

28:08.140 --> 28:11.420
three-day weekend is Memorial Day weekend at Fauna me yeah we're doing the

28:11.420 --> 28:15.620
panels at Fauna Mae so we'd love to meet some of our listeners. Yeah, and like like

28:15.620 --> 28:20.620
the last really bad drunk show I did get very sick. There will probably be some

28:20.620 --> 28:23.900
drinking at E3 Outpost because I know we're supposed to be doing that with the

28:23.900 --> 28:28.320
folks over at AllGames.com. They've got the little E3Outpost.com and

28:28.320 --> 28:31.660
they're supposed to have a bar so that might be a good time. That makes me a

28:31.660 --> 28:39.220
happy bunny. Yes, yeah, we'll see. The whole thing is, I don't know, last night was

28:39.220 --> 28:44.860
pretty bad I mean it was really bad I mean it's always your bachelor party you

28:44.860 --> 28:49.180
were supposed to I don't remember half of it I guess that's supposed to happen

28:49.180 --> 28:54.580
but luckily even though I can't remember it we do have it on video and I'm not

28:54.580 --> 28:57.660
sure I don't think obviously I want to put the the Mario Kart thing because I

28:57.660 --> 29:00.860
watched that today for the first time and I laughed my ass off I thought it

29:00.860 --> 29:08.420
was hilarious the face that I made was great oh you're so funny I know that was

29:08.420 --> 29:11.620
yelling at the volcano because it could

29:11.620 --> 29:16.980
yeah mil foolily says and I totally

29:16.980 --> 29:18.100
butchered that name sorry says that we

29:18.100 --> 29:19.780
should put it on wiki quote

29:19.780 --> 29:21.460
unfortunately I think Matt's wiki quote

29:21.460 --> 29:24.020
got VFD'd today I don't think it's

29:24.020 --> 29:26.420
there anymore so sadness but no more

29:26.420 --> 29:28.700
wiki quote for us now if somebody wanted

29:28.700 --> 29:30.340
to create one under orange lounge radio

29:30.340 --> 29:31.620
they might be able to get away with it

29:31.620 --> 29:33.140
this time I don't know we'll see

29:33.140 --> 29:35.940
yeah we're we're too busy converting

29:35.940 --> 29:37.940
videos to our ourselves on wiki but we

29:37.940 --> 29:40.180
We know you guys love the wiki.

29:40.180 --> 29:46.780
Then of course, I did play more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories, so it's all good.

29:46.780 --> 29:47.780
Awesome.

29:47.780 --> 29:52.280
Alright, let's get into some news from a bunch of no-name websites out there that we want

29:52.280 --> 29:53.280
to share with you guys.

29:53.280 --> 29:54.280
No, I'm kidding.

29:54.280 --> 29:55.620
I'm totally kidding.

29:55.620 --> 29:58.420
And I thought we'd start it off with this story tonight because I think this is very

29:58.420 --> 30:02.900
interesting and it's kind of a follow-up to this whole fallout that we were talking about

30:02.900 --> 30:04.900
earlier.

30:04.900 --> 30:09.360
as people reacted to our news as, who are these guys?

30:09.360 --> 30:11.540
This story comes from gamedaily.com.

30:11.540 --> 30:21.540
No one watches online video game TV and basically it's this report that was done by Forrester

30:21.540 --> 30:26.740
Research and the report found that 25% of online households have expressed interest

30:26.740 --> 30:33.780
in podcasting but only 2% have experimented with audio downloads and only 1% of households

30:33.780 --> 30:38.180
actually got a podcast onto a player.

30:38.180 --> 30:43.400
So podcasting is still kind of a very niche thing and they're saying that, you know, when

30:43.400 --> 30:49.500
you consider that PodNova has 55,000 different podcasts available out there, it's still not

30:49.500 --> 30:50.720
really catching on.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.240
I still say it's too new.

30:53.240 --> 30:58.060
I realize podcasting, you know, it's a very trendy thing in the nerd culture right now.

30:58.060 --> 31:01.100
I think it's still going to be a little while before we see this catch on.

31:01.100 --> 31:07.420
I think video casting, honestly, is where it's at and I'd love to do a video thing someday,

31:07.420 --> 31:12.140
but we have our own internal things to work out first before we do that, but I think until

31:12.140 --> 31:15.900
it gets to the video level, that's when it's going to really be able to compete with cable

31:15.900 --> 31:20.340
and satellite and all that good stuff, and it's starting to happen to some extent, but

31:20.340 --> 31:25.260
even the video casts that are available out there, most of them, about half of them, are

31:25.260 --> 31:29.780
pretty much shows or forms of shows that you can already find out there on the TV, so I

31:29.780 --> 31:34.700
think that's probably why this hasn't really caught on just yet so something

31:34.700 --> 31:39.180
to think about their online video game TV do you guys listen to any other

31:39.180 --> 31:44.260
podcast besides this one maybe that's our have time yeah I even listen to this

31:44.260 --> 31:47.780
one maybe that's part of it I listen to a couple but I wish I could listen to

31:47.780 --> 31:50.500
more but I don't like listening to my own voice so I don't listen to our

31:50.500 --> 31:56.300
podcast okay it's just I've just always been like it is a little weird hey no

31:56.300 --> 31:58.460
no not your voice I'm saying it's a little weird to hear yourself back well

31:58.460 --> 32:05.020
you know you're way too but no no uh I just kind of get weirded out by that but

32:05.020 --> 32:12.660
I just never have any time you know I've downloaded a few podcasts from you know

32:12.660 --> 32:17.300
for people I've actually met like at the podcast Awards mm-hmm and I've listened

32:17.300 --> 32:20.500
to a few others you know I try to check out the ones that are out there but I

32:20.500 --> 32:26.660
can't really dedicate any real time to it since I'm in school we have some

32:26.660 --> 32:29.540
comments in the chatroom or in the loungeradio.com, click on chat.

32:29.540 --> 32:32.700
VxjasonXV says, video casting is for porn.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.020
Gives a little salute, a mode icon, yeah, there you go.

32:35.020 --> 32:38.420
Rama says, bring back the OLR webcam.

32:38.420 --> 32:42.980
Maybe, well, maybe, I don't know, we'll see.

32:42.980 --> 32:46.060
And some other folks in chat are talking about some of the other shows that they

32:46.060 --> 32:47.540
listen to.

32:47.540 --> 32:51.100
Some folks that listen to shows over at allgames.com or

32:51.100 --> 32:54.660
shows that are affiliated with all games, such as Video Game Show.

32:54.660 --> 33:01.900
Some folks saying they listen to Dignation, DreamStation CC, I know they sent us something

33:01.900 --> 33:04.960
a while ago, we played around Christmas time.

33:04.960 --> 33:06.140
So very interesting.

33:06.140 --> 33:09.560
I think Overnight Scape was one of the ones I was listening to off and on, because I met

33:09.560 --> 33:11.360
the guy who runs it.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.900
He interviewed me at the podcast.

33:12.900 --> 33:14.980
I remember, I actually heard that, it was pretty cool.

33:14.980 --> 33:19.340
Alright, and you had an interview on the All Games podcast, didn't you, on Friday?

33:19.340 --> 33:20.740
Yeah, All Games Interactive.

33:20.740 --> 33:21.740
Yeah.

33:21.740 --> 33:22.740
Good time?

33:22.740 --> 33:23.740
Sure.

33:23.740 --> 33:28.220
Sure. I was like in such a

33:28.220 --> 33:31.260
rush that day. I don't remember what I was doing.

33:31.260 --> 33:34.820
I don't know. That's alright.

33:34.820 --> 33:38.020
Let's move on to another story. Let's go over to

33:38.020 --> 33:41.300
Dark Sakura. Got any news on the

33:41.300 --> 33:45.180
classic gaming consoles? I have something about the PS2.

33:45.180 --> 33:49.580
Classic enough. It's gonna be classic pretty soon. Seriously, it's alright.

33:49.580 --> 33:53.620
I can't believe I've had my Japanese PS2 for like

33:53.620 --> 33:56.900
ever. I have a first model one and it still works.

33:56.900 --> 34:01.180
That's, a lot of people... How's that for defeating the odds? Mine still works too, but I don't have a

34:01.180 --> 34:01.700
first

34:01.700 --> 34:05.740
gen. I got mine a couple years after it was out. I bought my Japanese PlayStation 2

34:05.740 --> 34:07.180
pretty much just for Beatmania.

34:07.180 --> 34:10.340
I picked up a couple other games, but pretty much that's the only one that gets

34:10.340 --> 34:10.820
played on it.

34:10.820 --> 34:15.660
Well, there's actually reporting from CNN Money,

34:15.660 --> 34:18.700
from Chris Morris at CNN Money, stating

34:18.700 --> 34:22.140
that the PlayStation 2's price is going to drop.

34:22.140 --> 34:25.380
Um, right now it's at $149,

34:25.380 --> 34:28.980
um, but now that the Xbox 360 is really

34:28.980 --> 34:32.020
staying there, um, it looks like, uh,

34:32.020 --> 34:37.420
they're gonna be dropping the price by about 20 bucks. Very cool. So,

34:37.420 --> 34:40.660
you know, in light of all these new systems coming out, they're gonna be a little more

34:40.660 --> 34:41.940
expensive. I think it's,

34:41.940 --> 34:46.180
you know, formulaic almost that these old consoles drop in price a little bit.

34:46.180 --> 34:50.900
So, some folks who still don't have a PS2 will be very happy. It's $20 though. I mean,

34:50.900 --> 34:54.700
if they really wanted to make it, they've already made back their money

34:54.700 --> 34:57.300
they should drop that thing to 99 and clear them out.

34:57.300 --> 35:00.940
They just sell a hell of a lot of games that way. I heard a rumor that they're

35:00.940 --> 35:01.800
actually talking to

35:01.800 --> 35:06.260
99 later. Maybe 99 will come at Christmas when PS3 is already out.

35:06.260 --> 35:10.060
I mean who out there is going, damn I'd buy that PS2

35:10.060 --> 35:15.740
if it were only twenty dollars cheaper. Every dollar counts though if you're trying to

35:15.740 --> 35:18.060
budget out. You know not everybody is

35:18.060 --> 35:21.420
in the games enough to wanna buy a GameCube,

35:21.420 --> 35:26.500
a PlayStation 2, and an Xbox. Never mind the DS, the PSP, and all that other stuff

35:26.500 --> 35:28.060
too. You know, not everybody is

35:28.060 --> 35:31.380
sick like we are and buys all those systems. Not everybody can afford it.

35:31.380 --> 35:34.940
I mean, I budget for those types of expenses but, you know,

35:34.940 --> 35:38.740
not everybody can do that. So, every

35:38.740 --> 35:42.060
every penny counts. A penny saved is a penny earned?

35:42.060 --> 35:45.320
I don't know, whatever. A penny saved is

35:45.320 --> 35:48.520
a penny that you already earned a penny set aside

35:48.520 --> 35:52.080
a dollar saved is when you should send to me it

35:52.080 --> 35:55.240
that's a phrase that I've never been able to to get behind

35:55.240 --> 35:58.800
just because a penny saved is a penny earned but you've already earned it

35:58.800 --> 36:03.120
so you didn't earn it twice what's up with that pennies aren't worth anything

36:03.120 --> 36:03.720
anyway

36:03.720 --> 36:06.880
could you get behind the dollar saved as a dollar you should send to

36:06.880 --> 36:11.360
orange launch radio I already says in my intro to pump up the volume to send me a

36:11.360 --> 36:11.960
dollar

36:11.960 --> 36:13.960
Two people have sent me a dollar.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.960
For real? I didn't know that.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.960
Two people have mailed me a dollar bill.

36:17.960 --> 36:19.960
Where's the cut?

36:19.960 --> 36:21.960
Where's our cut?

36:21.960 --> 36:25.960
It was invested into the show to give me beer.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.960
Oh, okay. Fair enough.

36:27.960 --> 36:29.960
That increases my entertainment value.

36:29.960 --> 36:31.960
Loki, for those folks...

36:31.960 --> 36:33.960
That bottle of fat tire that's in my fridge.

36:33.960 --> 36:37.960
Loki, for those folks who are ready to graduate to the Playstation 3

36:37.960 --> 36:40.960
and can't freaking wait for it, what's the latest on Playstation 3?

36:40.960 --> 36:45.880
Well, you'll get to play it at E3 this year, which is awesome.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.600
Except you gotta wait in line.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.600
A long line.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.240
A very, very, very, very, very, very long line.

36:51.240 --> 36:56.640
So basically, yeah it will be there, but it's gonna be pretty much like the PSP was when

36:56.640 --> 36:59.940
they first showed that a couple years ago.

36:59.940 --> 37:00.940
Long line.

37:00.940 --> 37:05.320
You know, Sony and Nintendo love to do the, you know, long line to play something.

37:05.320 --> 37:09.680
I'm sure this year Nintendo's gonna have a long line to play The Revolution.

37:09.680 --> 37:13.520
a big surprise you know hopefully there will be some actual games there it gives

37:13.520 --> 37:17.320
it that exclusive club feeling to it in a way you know like yeah I got to see

37:17.320 --> 37:21.560
the ps3 83 and you didn't you know one of those things like I didn't I don't

37:21.560 --> 37:25.360
wait in line for Zelda last year I know I'm crazy but I I just felt my three

37:25.360 --> 37:29.920
hours I was waiting I could have waited in line to see Zelda or I could have

37:29.920 --> 37:33.520
actually taken time to really look at some of the things in Kenshi a hall and

37:33.520 --> 37:38.840
there's some pretty you know good gems down there every year so I'm saying if

37:38.840 --> 37:43.400
rumor or fact on this PS3 thing? I guess we don't really know until E3, right?

37:43.400 --> 37:46.720
I'm gonna say probably fact, because it makes perfect sense.

37:46.720 --> 37:50.920
I mean, look at last year, they even went a step further at Microsoft's booth and they

37:50.920 --> 37:51.680
said,

37:51.680 --> 37:54.840
hey, you gotta be pressed in order to play the 360,

37:54.840 --> 38:00.400
bitch. So just because you deem it fact, then it must be fact, right?

38:00.400 --> 38:04.040
I'm speculating. I'm pulling that completely out of my ass.

38:04.040 --> 38:08.520
You might remember a classic video game. We're jumping from classic to new, but

38:08.520 --> 38:13.240
This is classic out of this world. You remember this game out of this world. It was released in 1991

38:13.240 --> 38:17.040
I want to say it came out on the Sega Genesis was one of the systems. It was on this was a game

38:17.040 --> 38:20.520
I never really got into but I know it has a really cult following to the game and

38:21.000 --> 38:28.280
It was a really nice-looking game and used 3d polygon like really before it was because I mean this was 91

38:28.280 --> 38:33.760
And we didn't really have PlayStation and things until super Nintendo baby. Yeah, super Nintendo had it too

38:33.760 --> 38:43.840
Well, a brand new version of this was released, and you can get this at www.AnotherWorld.fr.

38:43.840 --> 38:48.320
By the way, Another World is what they called this game outside the US, so if you are one

38:48.320 --> 38:52.200
of our outside the United States listeners, you know this game as Another World.

38:52.200 --> 38:57.960
So check out www.AnotherWorld.fr, you can download a shareware demo and unlock it for

38:57.960 --> 38:58.960
only 7 euros.

38:58.960 --> 39:02.660
It's only about $8.50 in US dollars, so check it out.

39:02.660 --> 39:06.400
If you're a fan of this game, you still love this game, it's a high resolution version,

39:06.400 --> 39:11.220
and the screenshot that I see here on this site, it makes it look very pretty, so definitely

39:11.220 --> 39:13.480
worth checking out if you have fond memories of this game.

39:13.480 --> 39:18.200
I think that's kind of a neat concept, too, to re-release your old game with a high res...

39:18.200 --> 39:22.320
Of course, I guess this has been done a million times before with Namco games and other collections.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.920
How about the whole Sega Ages?

39:24.920 --> 39:27.440
I guess this isn't really a new thing to do, but I don't know.

39:27.440 --> 39:32.000
Something about this game in particular, seeing as it was more of a small title, it's kind

39:32.000 --> 39:33.520
of interesting to see this get re-released.

39:33.520 --> 39:36.880
Where the hell's my remade friggin' blaster master?

39:36.880 --> 39:41.280
You will get your remade blaster master when Jamie and I get our remade guardian legend.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.280
Thank you very much.

39:42.280 --> 39:43.280
Drive-thru.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.280
Hello!

39:44.280 --> 39:45.280
Borderbun!

39:45.280 --> 39:46.280
Or was it borderbun?

39:46.280 --> 39:47.280
Broderbun?

39:47.280 --> 39:48.280
Broderbun?

39:48.280 --> 39:49.280
Buh-buh-buh-buh.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.280
Ugh-buh.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.280
Borderbuns?

39:51.280 --> 39:52.280
Border...

39:52.280 --> 39:53.280
Burntbuns?

39:53.280 --> 39:55.280
Well-formed squishybuns?

39:55.280 --> 39:56.680
Do they even exist anymore?

39:56.680 --> 39:57.680
You know what else they made?

39:57.680 --> 39:58.680
No.

39:58.680 --> 39:59.680
The print shop.

39:59.680 --> 40:00.680
Remember the print shop?

40:00.680 --> 40:01.680
No.

40:01.680 --> 40:06.920
on the dot matrix printers and it would take like an hour to print your damn

40:06.920 --> 40:11.160
banners that was you had the green and white paper wasn't that them I'm pretty

40:11.160 --> 40:16.060
sure that was that shit do you know what sucks is that my old computer lab at my

40:16.060 --> 40:23.280
college had dot matrix printers with the green and white paper comments from the

40:23.280 --> 40:27.360
chat room www.orangeonstray.com click on chat lots of celebration around

40:27.360 --> 40:31.540
blaster master 23rd magus would like you to know Broderbund also did where in the

40:31.540 --> 40:34.660
World is Carmen Sandiego, which is another big title.

40:34.660 --> 40:36.340
Yes they did.

40:36.340 --> 40:40.860
Moving on to another story, let's head on over to Loki.

40:40.860 --> 40:47.220
Yes, we have some news on the Xbox Live Arcade game.

40:47.220 --> 40:49.440
Actually I have this game, yet have never played it.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.940
Got it for free with one of those 12 month kits.

40:51.940 --> 40:56.300
They get the headset and all that stuff and they give you Bank Shot Billiards 2.

40:56.300 --> 41:03.200
Anyways, Bankshot Billiards 2 is now getting a new update to make it 3D.

41:03.200 --> 41:10.080
This is news actually that was posted via Major Nelson on his wonderful podcast.

41:10.080 --> 41:13.480
You know what's interesting is I tried to download the demo of Bankshot Billiards 2

41:13.480 --> 41:18.320
and when I try to run it, it connects to try to get the update and then says it cannot

41:18.320 --> 41:20.440
download the update in this time and kicks me out.

41:20.440 --> 41:24.000
So I tried to download the demo to see this 3D-ness and it booted me out.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.720
I also thought was very interesting 1200 points for that sucker that's 15 bucks

41:27.720 --> 41:30.780
if you want to play that game it's not that good of a game really probably not

41:30.780 --> 41:33.720
it didn't look it didn't look like it was something I had to own but a lot of

41:33.720 --> 41:37.100
my friends list is playing it so I'm like what am I missing out on and I like

41:37.100 --> 41:43.680
Yahoo pool I don't like billiards games I only have this on my 360 because it's

41:43.680 --> 41:50.900
free that is it all right you guys like to send us emails once in a while over

41:50.900 --> 41:55.720
www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, you can send your emails to Mailbag at

41:55.720 --> 42:00.320
OrangeLoungeRadio.com and when you do so DarkSakura will dig through the email

42:00.320 --> 42:02.960
and pull out some of her favorites and scold them on air.

42:02.960 --> 42:07.560
I have to wear a hazmat suit lately. And last week we didn't really, DarkSakura

42:07.560 --> 42:10.000
wasn't here so we did some MySpace messages because people have been sending

42:10.000 --> 42:13.360
us messages on MySpace so we did a couple of those but we need to catch up

42:13.360 --> 42:19.280
on some emails so let's have DarkSakura get on the suit, dig in the mailbag, pull

42:19.280 --> 42:30.880
out some hopefully not anthrax what you get um anthrax bring the noise um we have one from blaze

42:31.840 --> 42:38.560
uh hey sky loki and dark sakura why is my name not first i mean gee watch it after hearing the

42:38.560 --> 42:43.920
discussion about kingdom hearts 2 and the extremely slight chance of an mmorpg i started thinking

42:43.920 --> 42:48.720
about it in order to avoid having everyone as a keyblade holder thus resulting in no bad guy

42:48.720 --> 42:53.040
characters perhaps a movie could introduce an evil keyblade allowing for

42:53.040 --> 42:56.760
a balance of characters just a thought also I don't know if anyone still cares

42:56.760 --> 43:01.020
anymore but Microsoft is seriously sending out their Xbox Live diamond cards

43:01.020 --> 43:05.040
as fast as they were putting out the Xbox 360s sky by the way absolutely love

43:05.040 --> 43:08.840
need for speed most wanted on my Xbox 360 how dare you bash it I I didn't

43:08.840 --> 43:14.480
hold on I I may have bashed it and said how horrible looking it is but I also

43:14.480 --> 43:17.840
said I couldn't stop playing it for like a whole week and I think that says

43:17.840 --> 43:22.360
something that you can have a good sometimes there's it's it's the reason

43:22.360 --> 43:27.940
why when games are reviewed by people there's that fun factor that contributes

43:27.940 --> 43:30.780
really big to it that's outside of graphics outside of sound side of all

43:30.780 --> 43:34.280
that crap there's fun factor and for whatever reason and I still can't put my

43:34.280 --> 43:41.960
finger on it I found that game to be so much fun on the subject of eating

43:41.960 --> 43:45.960
healthy while gaming I will take a six-pack of propel water I used to drink

43:45.960 --> 43:49.420
this stuff all the time and drink that instead of a bunch of soda as always I

43:49.420 --> 43:54.660
love the show keep up the good work that was good but it got to be a little too

43:54.660 --> 43:58.660
sugary for me when I started cutting out a lot of sugar so now I'm drinking

43:58.660 --> 44:03.720
oxygen water which gives you very clean breath that sounds like a way to rip you

44:03.720 --> 44:06.860
off at the store it actually was cheaper than the other waters which is why I

44:06.860 --> 44:13.140
bought it all right fair enough what else do we have um well um did you

44:13.140 --> 44:19.380
already cover the MySpace message from Joey? Yes, that was last week. Well fine then. Sorry,

44:19.380 --> 44:26.700
I'm stealing my thunder. Well look, you weren't here. Hey, I'm kidding. Yeah, I was in a coma.

44:26.700 --> 44:29.740
I was dead at the time. You're gonna be back in a coma if you don't start reading some

44:29.740 --> 44:33.140
more email messages. Hey, this is rude to point. Better watch out or I'll like kick

44:33.140 --> 44:42.760
you from chat okay um got one from Robert M this is hey a lot of Rob's

44:42.760 --> 44:46.880
involved with orange launch radio I noticed we have Rob way I'm a Rob now we

44:46.880 --> 44:50.800
have Rob am all right hey again I didn't think you'd read my question on your

44:50.800 --> 44:54.200
show let alone when there are two weeks worth of nails to go through thanks

44:54.200 --> 44:58.960
again I've gone ahead and picked up beat mania and have two observations and two

44:58.960 --> 45:05.360
questions about it. 1. Despite being a hopeless, hopeless novice right now, I really prefer

45:05.360 --> 45:11.440
7-Key, the 2DX mode over 5-Key. The latter seems to only have 3 level 1 songs while 7-Key

45:11.440 --> 45:15.980
seems to have a better variety of songs suited for all skill levels. 2. You mentioned the

45:15.980 --> 45:21.520
overly colorful and technotrippy interface. To me, what it reminded me of most was Amplitude.

45:21.520 --> 45:24.660
Although Harmonic's name doesn't appear on the game, I'm wondering how much involvement

45:24.660 --> 45:31.220
the team had on this one. Zero. It's all Konami. Konami made this game the very first Beat

45:31.220 --> 45:37.460
Mania was in 98 and I want to say the first 2DX was 2000 or 2001, don't quote me on that,

45:37.460 --> 45:41.940
but somewhere in that area. Actually no wait, Beat Mania was probably 97 because DDR first

45:41.940 --> 45:49.340
came out in 98. Beat Mania was 97. Needless to say, they're old. The emulator that was

45:49.340 --> 45:55.500
the thing at the time was bm98 that's right that's right okay i still have bm98 why it sucks

45:56.060 --> 46:00.860
no it doesn't because it has all of the all of the neat like the person who did the um

46:01.660 --> 46:06.220
the metal gear music all right with the oh no the truck has started to move all right

46:07.340 --> 46:12.300
speaking of amplitude and sort of of frequency is it possible to use the beat media controller with

46:12.300 --> 46:16.620
those games i haven't really tried it but it seems to make sense doing so um i don't know i don't

46:16.620 --> 46:20.520
think it works because I don't it those seven buttons on your 2d x controller

46:20.520 --> 46:25.240
are not like circle square remapped it's a completely different signals I don't

46:25.240 --> 46:28.740
think it works I I think they should I think harmonic should have released a

46:28.740 --> 46:31.680
controller for those games I think it would have been a lot of fun but the

46:31.680 --> 46:35.340
last one finally which of the songs on beat me in the u.s. would you most like

46:35.340 --> 46:40.040
to see on TDR supernovas eventual console port just curious mr. T and one

46:40.040 --> 46:44.160
of the club mixes of 20 November would be my pick I hate 20 November yeah no

46:44.160 --> 46:46.000
So somebody in chat wanted me to say that earlier.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.800
20 November's okay, but it's not as great

46:47.800 --> 46:49.540
as people say it is.

46:49.540 --> 46:51.600
Bad Boy Bass, hello, I love that song.

46:53.760 --> 46:56.040
I'm really not very excited about many of the things

46:56.040 --> 46:59.680
that are in BeatMania that aren't already on DVR.

46:59.680 --> 47:02.540
There's stuff from like 8th Style I'd still like to see.

47:03.440 --> 47:07.560
So, like I still wanna be able to play,

47:10.320 --> 47:12.320
crap, now I forgot the name of the song.

47:12.320 --> 47:16.200
that's right it was it was the um

47:16.200 --> 47:20.720
I'm really mad at myself now for forgetting the name of the song cuz it

47:20.720 --> 47:21.800
was the one that I was play

47:21.800 --> 47:24.860
all the time the kind of a

47:24.860 --> 47:28.080
Caribbean sounding one I want monkey dance

47:28.080 --> 47:31.420
spunk spooky no no

47:31.420 --> 47:35.240
that did neither of those sound alright forget it forget it neither

47:35.240 --> 47:39.880
those sound anything remotely like that I'm okay we also have one from

47:39.880 --> 47:41.880
I guess it's...

47:41.880 --> 47:43.880
Our love?

47:43.880 --> 47:46.880
You know, I've been wondering something for a little while now.

47:46.880 --> 47:50.880
I have been listening to you guys and Gal for about a year now as a podcast.

47:50.880 --> 47:56.880
On a consistent basis, you guys seem to bring your classic and more often than not obscure games from the past.

47:56.880 --> 47:58.880
Which I love, by the way.

47:58.880 --> 48:01.880
So my question is this. When are you going to do a strictly classic gaming episode?

48:01.880 --> 48:06.880
I believe I remember that being suggested in passing on a show right before you changed to the new format.

48:06.880 --> 48:12.240
I kind of miss DarkSakura's tips section when I hear the music for the mailbag, but oh well.

48:13.360 --> 48:18.960
Um, I would speculate we'll probably do that if there's going to be a show where we want,

48:18.960 --> 48:23.360
we can't be here again. Like, uh, a couple months ago, Loki had to fill in a couple weeks.

48:23.360 --> 48:27.680
Uh, if we have time to pre-tape in advance, we'll probably do a classic game show next time

48:27.680 --> 48:32.560
we're all not gonna be here. But honestly, because of E3 and everything, none of us can really afford

48:32.560 --> 48:34.600
to all of us be gone.

48:34.600 --> 48:37.960
I know, are you out next week, Dark Soccer, for birthday?

48:37.960 --> 48:41.000
Yeah, I'm gonna be in a coma.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.520
And then you're out in two weeks for wedding, right?

48:43.520 --> 48:46.480
Yes, so are you.

48:46.480 --> 48:48.000
But is the wedding on Sunday or Saturday?

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Yes.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Oh, I thought it was Saturday this whole time.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Oh, it's Sunday.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Oh, crap.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.240
Then maybe there'll be one coming up sooner than later.

48:54.240 --> 48:55.720
We'll podcast your wedding.

48:55.720 --> 48:56.720
Probably the day of Loki's wedding.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.920
I joked about that, but yeah.

48:58.920 --> 49:01.420
We need to plan on that.

49:01.420 --> 49:04.100
probably the day of Loki's wedding since we can't do a show live maybe we'll do

49:04.100 --> 49:09.060
that that's a good idea well maybe we can invite some other folks talk about

49:09.060 --> 49:15.460
it too be fun well um there's also another bit on this when we mentioned

49:15.460 --> 49:22.020
captain and he brought up kid video I used to watch kid video religiously when

49:22.020 --> 49:29.740
I was what seven so yeah I know kid video is about a little garage band

49:29.740 --> 49:34.080
they get sucked into an animated world it had the little pixie girl who would

49:34.080 --> 49:39.960
sneeze and it was really crazy yeah I remember kid video do you remember kid

49:39.960 --> 49:45.120
video no I've never played that game it's not a game oh so you're not even

49:45.120 --> 49:52.780
paying attention that's correct I also have one from Mike G first off I'd like

49:52.780 --> 49:57.000
to say that your guys's show is so awesome and I think you I think you guys

49:57.000 --> 50:01.380
for bringing updates every week even if it's games that you don't like but let

50:01.380 --> 50:07.020
me get out right to the point okay um first of all punctuation there is not a

50:07.020 --> 50:10.920
single punctuation point except at the very end of this email I just thought

50:10.920 --> 50:17.000
I'd point that out and I'm a grammar nerd yes you are so let me see if I can

50:17.000 --> 50:26.460
I'm good at interpreting that stuff okay okay let me get right to the point I was

50:26.460 --> 50:29.580
I was listening to your podcast last week while you had the guy from Konami.

50:29.580 --> 50:33.700
Well my question is, I hear everybody talking about DDR Supernova, but for some reason it's

50:33.700 --> 50:36.860
like they skipped flor- flor- dia?

50:36.860 --> 50:38.860
I guess it's flor- flor- flor- Florida.

50:38.860 --> 50:39.860
Florida.

50:39.860 --> 50:40.860
But it said flor-dia.

50:40.860 --> 50:41.860
Alright.

50:41.860 --> 50:43.880
We have no release date or anything.

50:43.880 --> 50:47.280
If you guys can give me a link or even some kind of update, I would be really grateful

50:47.280 --> 50:52.040
because I know a lot of people out there that don't know either and you guys wouldn't just

50:52.040 --> 50:57.040
be helping me but many people, thanks and keep up the good work on Miles Radio for Life.

50:57.040 --> 50:58.040
You guys will get it.

50:58.040 --> 50:59.040
I mean, every state's going to have it.

50:59.040 --> 51:01.440
I think it wants to know when Supernova's coming out in Florida.

51:01.440 --> 51:04.380
Supernova's coming out in Florida when Supernova comes out for everybody.

51:04.380 --> 51:08.440
And I guess the rumor was that they were taking orders for the first 50 machines and then

51:08.440 --> 51:09.440
it closed.

51:09.440 --> 51:15.600
I don't really know how much to really credit all that, but I would say it was supposed

51:15.600 --> 51:16.960
to be out this month, right?

51:16.960 --> 51:20.920
So any day now, really, we should start seeing these machines pop up.

51:20.920 --> 51:24.400
I don't think it'll really spread like wildfire till over the summer so you have

51:24.400 --> 51:27.000
to wait till summer for your local arcade to get this

51:27.000 --> 51:31.440
but if you live near a big city with a big arcade

51:31.440 --> 51:35.400
that has had Xtreme and the other DDR games

51:35.400 --> 51:39.300
this one will be coming as well just give it time

51:39.300 --> 51:42.680
but yeah we don't keep tabs on every arcade in the country so we can't ask

51:42.680 --> 51:45.660
don't be afraid to ask your local arcade it's a good way to show

51:45.660 --> 51:49.600
that you support it too. DDR Freak. DDR Freak has a locations listing

51:49.600 --> 51:52.720
That's true too. Anything that's put up there, being a moderator there,

51:52.720 --> 51:55.760
we regularly verify those to make sure

51:55.760 --> 52:00.160
that, you know, ratings, location, everything is there. Just use DDR Freaks.

52:00.160 --> 52:04.880
Exactly. Location listing. I also, though, like the idea just to ask the arcade operator

52:04.880 --> 52:07.040
because that shows that there's interest in the game and they're more likely to

52:07.040 --> 52:07.520
order it.

52:07.520 --> 52:11.400
It's very powerful. So get all your friends together and ask. Don't be afraid.

52:11.400 --> 52:14.760
Couple more emails. Alrighty. Another one from Robert M.

52:14.760 --> 52:18.400
I just listened to part A of the podcast

52:18.400 --> 52:22.800
And I'd be genuinely surprised if the majority of those 50 launch titles

52:22.800 --> 52:26.160
weren't the NES, Genesis, TurboGrafx-16 downloadables.

52:26.160 --> 52:31.640
Uh, also, I think he'll found out in part B. I kinda corrected myself there.

52:31.640 --> 52:37.600
Yeah. Well, I figured I'd go ahead and address this. Um, hopefully we'll see as many as six full retail

52:37.600 --> 52:39.280
available titles to go with those.

52:39.280 --> 52:43.200
Just out of curiosity and to compare how many Xbox arcade launch games were there.

52:43.200 --> 52:46.240
Um, there's a question.

52:46.240 --> 52:48.240
I'm sorry, I was reading chat. What was it?

52:48.240 --> 52:51.240
How many Xbox Live Arcade games were there at one point?

52:52.240 --> 52:53.240
Like 20?

52:53.240 --> 52:56.240
No, not that many. Maybe 10.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.240
10?

52:57.240 --> 53:02.240
The first week that Xbox was out, probably about 10. I really don't know.

53:02.240 --> 53:09.240
I'd say 10 to 15. I can't remember exactly. I bought a lot of them, but not all of them.

53:09.240 --> 53:13.240
I think there was about 10. Ask Major Nelson, he'd know.

53:13.240 --> 53:16.360
You say that and I keep thinking of I Dream of Jeannie.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.880
Sorry.

53:18.880 --> 53:22.160
The last one says, hey guys doing a great job with the podcast.

53:22.160 --> 53:25.880
My favorite thing to do after work is to play World of Warcraft while listening to the show.

53:25.880 --> 53:30.320
Right on. Alright, that's so cool. Speaking of World of Warcraft, did you...

53:30.320 --> 53:33.960
Alright, sorry. Okay, sorry. Go ahead.

53:33.960 --> 53:37.160
I saw the most effed up video this week and it was...

53:37.160 --> 53:41.160
Lord of the Rings? No, no, the people crashing the funeral party.

53:41.160 --> 53:47.800
Like, somebody in real life passed away, and they were holding an online funeral service

53:47.800 --> 53:51.320
for this, I think it was a she, that passed away.

53:51.320 --> 53:57.040
And since it was on a PVP server, these guys had posted about it on a forum, and what happened

53:57.040 --> 54:01.320
is that, I think it was a Horde character, well a bunch of this whole big group on the

54:01.320 --> 54:04.720
Alliance side came to the funeral and killed them all.

54:04.720 --> 54:08.500
That's horrible!

54:08.500 --> 54:13.560
Part of me is like, that is so wrong, but there's another half of me like the same half

54:13.560 --> 54:18.560
that really likes South Park and that fucked up stuff that goes, you know, like, and I

54:18.560 --> 54:23.720
know it's really wrong, but that's, let me put it this way, it goes to show why I hate

54:23.720 --> 54:25.720
the PVP servers on World of Warcraft.

54:25.720 --> 54:29.920
Sorry to this guy if you're a PVP player, whatever floats your boat, I personally hate

54:29.920 --> 54:31.140
the PVP servers.

54:31.140 --> 54:34.820
I had bad experience with the PVP, but anyway.

54:34.820 --> 54:35.820
Can I finish my email now?

54:35.820 --> 54:38.080
Yes you may, sorry.

54:38.080 --> 54:41.620
Thank you, Rob!

54:41.620 --> 54:47.160
Although this isn't exactly headline news like the Red Steel screenshots drool, I work

54:47.160 --> 54:50.720
for Philips and they're working on this new technology which sounds like something I've

54:50.720 --> 54:52.760
only dreamed about.

54:52.760 --> 54:57.000
Imagine feeling the rush of wind when jumping out of your plane in Metal Gear Solid 3 or

54:57.000 --> 55:01.920
having your sofa rumble and all the lights in your room flicker red when Sephiroth appears

55:01.920 --> 55:05.020
in the flames in Final Fantasy VII.

55:05.020 --> 55:09.160
This could be really cheesy, but if the technology is really good and becomes widespread, and

55:09.160 --> 55:13.360
developers start creating games with this in mind, along with how excited I am about

55:13.360 --> 55:19.400
the innovative revolution, the next few years could be huge for gaming, and where it's headed.

55:19.400 --> 55:25.260
I gave a link to ambx.com, there's some video on the site that gives you an idea of the

55:25.260 --> 55:30.060
lighting effects we're talking about, lightning strikes, and all the lights in the rooms flicker,

55:30.060 --> 55:34.240
a plane flies by and creates a rush of wind, sure it's from dinky fans, but still.

55:34.240 --> 55:38.260
And this isn't just for gaming, suppose it's for movies, music, PC versions of games are

55:38.260 --> 55:42.420
supposed to already be released this year, and console versions next.

55:42.420 --> 55:44.060
Look for this at E3.

55:44.060 --> 55:45.060
Think this will catch on?

55:45.060 --> 55:49.120
If not this, then technology like this revolution seems to be a step in that direction.

55:49.120 --> 55:50.120
Keep up the good work.

55:50.120 --> 55:53.680
If you use this, you can refer to me as Bear Who Drive...

55:53.680 --> 55:54.680
Bear Who Drive Car.

55:54.680 --> 55:57.360
I'm sorry, I actually didn't see that until the very end.

55:57.360 --> 55:58.360
My apologies.

55:58.360 --> 55:59.360
Um, P.S.

55:59.360 --> 56:03.720
I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, but it's ridiculous how much I want a goddamn DS Lite.

56:03.720 --> 56:08.520
I also agree with Sky, Final Fantasy XI is going to die shortly after Xbox 360 has released this expansion.

56:08.520 --> 56:12.600
I did say, I said that, I guess I must have.

56:12.600 --> 56:15.880
I don't think it's gonna die, I just think it's gonna, I actually think it's gonna...

56:15.880 --> 56:20.040
Oh, I remember what it was. The comment was that I said the third expansion is gonna be the last one,

56:20.040 --> 56:21.640
probably, and then it will start to die off.

56:21.640 --> 56:25.360
I don't think it'll be shortly, but I think, you know, in the next couple years...

56:25.360 --> 56:29.560
There will always be crazies that play Final Fantasy XI, probably I'll be one of them.

56:29.560 --> 56:33.580
Just like there's crazies that still play EverQuest, and you know I use that term

56:33.580 --> 56:38.140
endearingly, but I think the popularity,

56:38.140 --> 56:42.900
you'll see server consolidations in a good two years.

56:42.900 --> 56:46.780
So, the other thing I want to comment on that, the whole

56:46.780 --> 56:50.020
room lighting thing, that technology's actually been around a while.

56:50.020 --> 56:53.420
On the Commodore 64, I remember this, there used to be a program

56:53.420 --> 56:57.220
where you could have the Commodore 64 control the lights in your house

56:57.220 --> 57:00.260
for like when you're away on vacation or whatever, you could have the Commodore 64

57:00.260 --> 57:04.220
regulating the lights in your house. So it's not this huge... Uh, I think this is a little something different.

57:04.220 --> 57:07.880
Well, no, I know, but I know it's a completely, but they're saying that, you

57:07.880 --> 57:10.660
know, you want to change the lights red for when Sephiroth comes in, all this other

57:10.660 --> 57:14.380
like lighting effects you can do in your house, right? No, it'd be more like an

57:14.380 --> 57:15.740
interactive station.

57:15.740 --> 57:21.060
Alright. But, um, they actually, there were things very similar to that, the

57:21.060 --> 57:22.620
previous E3s, like the,

57:22.620 --> 57:26.140
what was it called, the ass kicker or something?

57:26.140 --> 57:30.180
that that thing that you put under your chair and it makes and you feel the bass

57:30.180 --> 57:31.540
in your butt or something

57:31.540 --> 57:35.020
I got I thought that thing was kinda cool but you know like it

57:35.020 --> 57:39.580
especially for the music games or for some the effects in the games

57:39.580 --> 57:42.700
you know I I think though that

57:42.700 --> 57:47.380
having something immersive like that is gonna be pricey but I think it really

57:47.380 --> 57:48.500
would enhance the

57:48.500 --> 57:51.540
experience be interesting alright

57:51.540 --> 57:56.600
Is that it? Alright. You know what, with all that we're just one step closer to the

57:56.600 --> 57:57.240
holodeck

57:57.240 --> 58:01.760
from Star Trek. That's where gaming will be in 50 years. It'll be the holodeck.

58:01.760 --> 58:05.900
You know, I had this conversation with somebody like a year and a half ago.

58:05.900 --> 58:10.120
We were doing our big Trekkie nerd discussion and we were talking about how holodecks are

58:10.120 --> 58:10.560
like

58:10.560 --> 58:15.320
the Nintendo of the future. Pretty much. Someday we'll do this show in a

58:15.320 --> 58:19.280
in a holodeck form. It'll be amazing. You could, you know, sit on our laps during the

58:19.280 --> 58:21.300
show. No, please don't. That's violating us.

58:21.300 --> 58:29.940
Anyway, moving on, I think we have a contest to settle, do we not?

58:29.940 --> 58:30.940
Perhaps.

58:30.940 --> 58:31.940
That's right.

58:31.940 --> 58:36.420
We have a little giveaway that we did last week, and that was with 24.

58:36.420 --> 58:38.100
We said we were going to give away a prize pack.

58:38.100 --> 58:45.340
We said you had to email us, jack24 at orangelaunchradio.com, with two people that had died during season

58:45.340 --> 58:46.340
five.

58:46.340 --> 58:48.820
We're going to pick ourselves a winner right now.

58:48.820 --> 58:50.580
MarkSakura, give me a number.

58:50.580 --> 58:51.820
That many times nine.

58:51.820 --> 58:54.300
Something between one and that many times nine.

58:54.300 --> 58:55.620
Four.

58:55.620 --> 58:57.020
Four.

58:57.020 --> 58:58.020
You always keep them low.

58:58.020 --> 58:59.020
Let's do this.

58:59.020 --> 59:00.220
One, two, three, four.

59:00.220 --> 59:01.220
Here's our winner.

59:01.220 --> 59:02.220
Our winner is...

59:02.220 --> 59:06.220
Oh, I have to verify that they got two characters right here.

59:06.220 --> 59:09.040
Yes, they said David Palmer and Edgar Stiles.

59:09.040 --> 59:11.420
Those are indeed two people that died this season.

59:11.420 --> 59:17.220
So say congratulations, everybody, to MiniMe283 won the 24th contest.

59:17.220 --> 59:18.220
One of our chatters.

59:18.220 --> 59:22.300
Yes, one of our chatters. I like it when the chatty people win. Good job!

59:22.300 --> 59:24.380
He was actually, I think, eating right now.

59:24.380 --> 59:27.380
So he's away and didn't even hear that.

59:27.380 --> 59:29.040
Yeah. Alright, well...

59:29.040 --> 59:32.180
That would be mini food.

59:32.180 --> 59:34.700
Alright, so DarkSucker, you remember what they're going to win in that prize pack?

59:34.700 --> 59:36.940
Will I forward this to myself here?

59:36.940 --> 59:41.840
Oh, I'm sorry. It was the game and the shirt, right? Yeah, a bunch of stuff.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.100
That'll be good times.

59:43.100 --> 59:48.620
So big thanks to our buddies over at 2K Games that are hooking us up with these prize packs.

59:48.620 --> 59:50.460
Appreciate it.

59:50.460 --> 59:55.420
It's awesome. People like to win free stuff. They like to win free stuff so much

59:55.420 --> 59:57.700
that we're going to give away something else right now.

59:57.700 --> 01:00:01.140
We're going to give away also a copy of

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.720
Amped 3

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.220
for the 360. That's right, for the Xbox 360.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:09.380
And you've played this game a lot, Loki, right? What do you do in this game?

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:16.380
Well, it's a basic snowboarding game. It's really... what kind of sets it apart is the way they kind of do the storyline.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:26.380
It's done with like sock puppets and just weird... it's just very trippy. Very punkish. So definitely worth checking out.

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:35.380
And yeah, really cool game. A lot of people kind of skimmed over it and now it's only $39.99 I think out there in stores.

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:38.420
so if you can find a used copy that's even better

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:44.260
so check it out. Alright let's give that one away right now we're gonna do

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:47.820
Loki give me a number between one and that many times 10

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:51.300
okay let's go with

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:55.020
14. Alright let's see

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:58.700
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:04.580
13, 14 and

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:08.780
Is that the same person that won last? No, I don't think that is. I think this is a different person.

01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:15.580
So I think this one wins. This goes to MikeG1amp3.

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:19.380
Good job. Excellent. Congratulations to you, my friend.

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:23.020
You're a winner. Thank you to everybody that participated,

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:26.300
and we'll be doing more giveaways in the future, of course.

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:31.900
Alright, let's move on to our next story, and that comes courtesy of me,

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:36.260
Final Fantasy XI, you know I've been playing the crap out of that game lately

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:40.140
and I thought this is very interesting the new expansion Treasures of Ot Urgen

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:40.940
comes out

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:44.200
on April 18th although I have a feeling that's the ship day meaning it'll

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.880
probably really be on shelves the 19th

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.460
yeah here's the thing even if you buy it on the 19th

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:53.680
you can't actually play it until the 20th of April

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:57.640
because the reason why they're doing this is because the game will be out in all

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.520
territories until that time so essentially they're

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.960
giving everybody the shot at starting at the same time

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.440
secretly I think there's also a 420 reference to be made in there

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.600
but regardless even if you buy this expansion realize you can't use it

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.640
until April 20th is when they'll actually turn it on so kinda interesting

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.920
I like that idea though keeps things fair yes April 20th where the secret

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.040
secret character

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:22.480
junkie will be available that's right junkie whore will be an unlockable job

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.360
class in the new Final Fantasy I'll be great

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.360
and they'll all be Mithras

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.080
Imagine that, they'll all be Mithras.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:32.040
I thought they'd be Taro.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.520
I would play a Taro junkie whore.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.040
I think that would be fun, actually.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.400
It'd be a good time.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.280
All right, Loki, what do you got?

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:44.640
I've got some info about the IEMA and VSDA merging.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.720
And of course, I always hear about the VSDA,

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.280
just job-related stuff.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.400
The Interactive Air Team Merchants Association,

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.800
basically the VSDA of video games, and the VSDA,

01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:02.280
the Video Software Dealers Association, who basically represent all the mass merchants,

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:09.120
video specialty stores, etc. Well, now they're combined, so it's going to be one place for

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:15.300
all the interactive software sales and stuff. And basically, they have to say, by coming

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:20.000
together in one organization, the retailers, distributors of DVDs and video games will increase

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.760
their collective power and the benefit from business acumen and product knowledge of one

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:34.440
another. And that's basically quoted from the chairman, VSDA chairman Bob Geisman. So,

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:39.560
I think that's pretty cool. That means I might have to go to VSDA this year. I don't know,

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:44.560
they always throw a really cool show down in Vegas. So, right about the same time as

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.480
the porno convention. Right next door.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.560
What do you think the long-term effects of this will be on the game industry?

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.820
That's good. You're gonna see, definitely

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.440
you know, the IEMA

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.760
and VSDA are gonna be, you know, ones saying

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.120
you know, hell no, we don't want these stupid video game laws, you know,

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.320
ones that they're trying to pass limiting the sales of this stuff.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:12.600
It's definitely, you know, gonna be easier to go up against people that try to

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.720
propose this kind of stuff.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:17.920
which is always good, I think, you know, let the parents regulate what

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.240
their kids play. So, always a good thing.

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.680
Alright, let's go on to our next story,

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.840
Dark Sakura! Some people are a little too into this guitar hero, aren't they?

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.640
Yeah, they've been taking hacksaws to it. I mean, sorry, they were hacking

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.440
into the controller. They were hacksawing it with a hacksaw? It got hacksawed hardcore.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.080
No, they have actually, a group of

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.760
students at University of California decided to

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.840
try to turn the Guitar Hero peripheral into

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:52.400
a real instrument. They've mapped different WAV files into the controller's

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.640
buttons so that you press the button and it will start playing the loop.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:58.540
And so you, because you've mapped the different sounds, you can sort of play

01:04:58.540 --> 01:04:59.880
different stuff on it. It's more like,

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.980
well, I don't know, like... It's a MIDI sequencer. Yeah,

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:07.280
that's what I was about to say. But,

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.680
but I mean, even Red Octane's kinda,

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.120
you know thinks it's pretty cool there's a quote here that says

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:18.560
we in harmonics both very much I'm sorry are both very much encouraged by this

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.400
type of fandom

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:23.920
having a game that a community like this thrives around is a great achievement

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:29.640
but it's the community that keeps it going they're awesome so

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.800
I thought that was actually a quote from Jon Tam I like that they endorse the

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.240
hacking that's pretty cool of them

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:39.360
you know well you know how I honestly think that

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:44.280
we're gonna see more new innovation based on the fan community

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.960
you know because I really see that a lot of

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.440
game companies are not going to be as willing to experiment in depth

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:56.200
but when it comes from the fans they see that there's a type of interest in this

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.240
type of thing that

01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:01.080
it might turn on a few light bulbs and have the hamster wheels moving

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:05.200
Alright, moving on to another story

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.120
there's this new Spike Lee movie The Inside Man and

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:16.160
Inside the inside man. There's actually a scene and this is a story. This is a news article coming from joystick.com

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:24.440
That actually there's a scene an inside man that uses grand theft auto or a not the actual game

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.560
But a grand theft auto like game

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:34.880
To do this very violent scene where I guess some guy gets a hand grenade in his mouth or something is the scene there

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.960
in the game

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:41.200
But it's in the movie, because they're trying to depict video games as violent.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:46.360
And Spike Lee is hoping that this scene doesn't actually get done in a future game.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.360
He explains,

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.400
I just hope people understand that that is an absolute statement about my horror at how

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:56.080
violent these games that young kids play are, and also the infatuation with violence and

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.280
gangster rap among the black community.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.960
It's not a real game, but not that far-fetched from the games that are being sold.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:08.320
It's my thought that Spike Lee has decided to believe everything he sees on TV.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.320
You know what?

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.720
That's not violent enough.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.260
I'm not satisfied.

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.260
You want to see more?

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:16.560
You want to see more violent stuff?

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.560
Hell yeah.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:22.520
Alright, might I also point out Spike Lee has brought to you many different films out

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.520
there.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.400
Trying to think of some of these that are R-rated movies that he's done.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.100
What is Do the Right Thing R-rated?

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:32.560
I think so.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:39.700
see yeah USA that was an r-rated movie and let's see how about Malcolm X was

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:46.420
that rated R as well I wouldn't doubt it uh actually was pg-13 still not

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:50.500
appropriate for children under 13 though you get the idea here I'm just kind of

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:55.220
trying to be a smartass on this one you know Hollywood puts out the violent

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:59.900
stuff too so I don't really get it it seems like it's the pot calling the

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:04.020
Kettle Black, which is probably a really bad analogy to use in that scenario, but...

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:09.340
You know what? I believe this is the way we should eliminate, um, contestants from American

01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:13.100
Idol. But... I think they need to have Battle Royale.

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:16.300
America does not like your singing, therefore we will take off your head.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:19.500
You know what MMO we need? Battle Royale. The MMO.

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.820
That would actually be a lot of fun. I want a game that's just shoving grenades

01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.780
in people's mouths. It'd just be a big PVP.

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:28.960
Maybe that could be like the game, you know how, uh, people always make games to answer

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.560
Wait a second! Wait a second!

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.960
What? I do remember a game where you shove grenades in people's mouths. What?

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:41.460
Blaster Master! That fucking frog had it coming to him and he tossed grenades in his mouth!

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:45.760
Fuck that! Spike Lee, you were beat by it quite a long time.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.840
But that's when you hit pause while it's exploding and then you wait like six seconds

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.260
and unpause and it'll kill him.

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.260
Exactly, but still it's been done.

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:58.600
Yes. Blaster Master did it. You know I think somebody should make a game that's

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.600
like kaboom, but instead it's just a giant mouth that's catching all these grenades falling

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:07.520
from the sky? That'd be great! What a perfect response to this article. And send it, send

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:12.520
a nice little care package over to Spike Lee and say, with love, the gaming community.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:19.520
Loki. Speaking of movies soon to be made. Yes, they're making a movie for Cold Fear.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:28.600
Basically, a press release put out by Dark Works S.A., the leading French video game

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:33.240
developer, although I thought Ubisoft was the leading French video game developer, but

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:39.640
I could be wrong, that they are, I don't know, they're putting out another movie that's going

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.840
to probably be crap.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.520
Are they making it in French?

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.520
Or what?

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:48.620
I don't know, to be honest.

01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:52.560
I see video game movie for a game that I haven't played

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.160
you know

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.320
I don't know

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.800
although it should be noted that Darkworks

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:00.880
they

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:04.040
did previously release Alone in the Dark The New Nightmare

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.620
which if I remember correctly I think that one sucked

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:09.920
I think that was the last one that came out

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.160
well moving on to a title that everybody recognizes uh... at least

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.040
quite a few million of them this week

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.360
what game would that be? Dark Soccer?

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:22.160
that would be a skies voice the game yeah right

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.720
actually a kingdom hearts to hit two point five million uh...

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:30.040
it's actually approaching ten million uh... in the world

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.040
it's pretty cool huh

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:35.440
wow that's a lot of uh... sales but yeah but for japan and north america top two

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:39.300
point five million that's one point two million for japan since uh...

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:42.760
december twenty second one point three million in north america since uh... the

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.220
twenty eighth of uh... last month

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:46.360
uh...

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.680
this series worldwide has hit 8.5 million

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.840
with the European release they're expecting it to top 10

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.840
10 million and actually

01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.640
the numbers are well-deserved it really is a very well done game

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.320
very cool this game might sell that many copies

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:09.360
probably not but Metroid Prime 3 is going to be the flagship title for

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.000
Nintendo Revolution

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.400
what? well that's what they're saying Nintendo is going to be showing this

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.120
fully playable at the E3 Expo.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:23.320
Now I'm wondering if it's not Metroid Prime 3 on GameCube but with

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.640
revolution enhancements

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:27.760
sorta like they're saying is going to happen with or that would have to be

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:28.660
happening with Zelda.

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:31.920
I think that's a little more along the lines of what's really going on is that

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.320
Metroid Prime 3 is probably a GameCube game but

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:38.220
with revolution aspect to it. So that should be very interesting because

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:41.440
this game kind of... Metroid Prime 3. Huh? Prime 3. Right.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.680
That's what I said. You said Hunters. Did I? Oh, I'm sorry. Metroid Prime 3.

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:49.240
My bad. So Metroid Prime 3 is going to be shown at E3.

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.120
And this kind of came out of nowhere a little bit because I think the focus has

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.480
been on the Metroid DS game that people sort of forgot that, oh yeah,

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.520
I guess they could do another sequel to Metroid Prime if they wanted to, huh?

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:02.280
So, be very interesting to see how that goes. They could do billions of sequels. They could do billions

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:07.160
among billions. So we'll see what happens. That should be an exciting time. I really

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.000
liked Metroid Prime 2 at last year's E3, but I never really...

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.360
I mean, it's just my GameCube. I have to be honest, I don't play it so much because

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.540
there's not a lot of new titles to get really excited about on GameCube anymore.

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:21.380
Maybe with the Zelda, we'll see. One more story for this segment, Loki.

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:25.300
Yes, you know when you thought that

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:29.940
you couldn't whore Burger King enough in 360 games,

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:33.420
well you're wrong. They're gonna actually make their own

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:36.900
Xbox 360 games. That's right,

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:40.060
Burger King is going to be making

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:44.900
games for the 360 and Xbox. I guess they will be Xbox games that will be fully

01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:49.020
compatible with the 360 that will be gonna be selling for three dollars and sixty

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:49.740
nine cents.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:53.580
I'm sure these will be

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:58.180
top-shelf games. You'll be buying them with your Angus

01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:58.980
cheesy bacon

01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:02.420
steak burger, which I might add by the way isn't very good.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:05.700
Not a very good game. They do have three games that are going to be coming out

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:08.740
very appropriately deemed action,

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:13.900
fighting and racing. The action game, they're comparing it to

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:17.700
Halo or Destroy All Humans

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:22.860
which, okay. Which will probably turn out more like Wolfenstein 3D, but yeah.

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:27.300
The fighting game is supposed to be combining elements of Street Fighter

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.300
and moral combat.

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:32.260
That's excellent.

01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:35.460
Who's the king gonna fight? We all know the king would be, who's gonna fight?

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:36.980
I don't know, who cares?

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:40.980
the evil, he could fight, he could beat the shit out of Hamburglar and Ronald McDonald

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:42.820
I don't know, they might have problems with that.

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:46.860
And racing is basically gonna be combining

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:50.660
or they said it's very comparable to Need for Speed

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:54.660
or Forza, which I had to laugh. They do have some

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:57.940
or I should say Kotaku posted some

01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:02.300
screenshots or I guess, I don't know

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:05.380
Internal documents or something? Something like that of

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:09.080
concept art I guess. I heard they've gotten a little bit of hot water

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:12.440
yeah yeah but the screenshots are hilarious

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:16.280
there's like one that's looking like the Kings trying to like give a hamburger to

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.480
some prostitute

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:22.200
and there's another one where... Is that for real? Come on, this shit has joke written all

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:22.720
over it like

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.240
a commercial or something marketing campaign. Well

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:32.080
I don't know but you know it'd be interesting to try out, let me put it that way

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:37.080
I don't know what kind of achievement points I can get for the Burger King games.

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:40.080
Because that's really what I'm concerned about.

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:44.080
Alright, looking in the chat room for some comments there.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.080
Psycoon suggests World of Burger Craft.

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.080
That might be fun.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:51.080
Ota G says Burger Combat!

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.080
Plays a little music behind that I'm sure.

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:56.080
DJ Poo Eater says Clerk Killer.

01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:00.080
So the King could be fighting all the Burger King employees.

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:06.320
employees that might be exciting who knows oh you know what how about the BK

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.640
kids club remember the BK kids club that's who the king needs to regulate on

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:17.360
that would be fun that'd be kick-ass all right we're gonna go to a break here

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:21.340
we'll be back a little later on with more of orange lounge radio orange

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:25.280
