[SPEAKER_02]: It's just us.

00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:25,889

[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not calling this an official episode.

19
00:01:28,312 --> 00:01:29,633
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a mini episode.

20
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:31,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I like episode-let.

21
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:33,435
[SPEAKER_02]: A little episode let?

22
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:34,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that name too.

23
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:35,496
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call it an episode let.

24
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:36,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

25
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:36,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a nugget.

26
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, a little episode let.

27
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:39,858
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of gross.

28
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:42,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nugget poop.

29
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is our little episode let for this April 29, 2006.

30
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:50,283
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be no Part B this week, so please don't be looking for it.

31
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,143
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only going to do about half a show tonight.

32
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:55,665
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been kind of a slow news week too, all things considered.

33
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:56,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee you Wednesday.

34
00:01:57,086 --> 00:01:57,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Part B?

35
00:01:58,346 --> 00:02:01,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put up a picture of a face sticking out a tongue and go, there's your Part B.

36
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:22,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Allgames.com 630-ish

37
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:46,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I may find John Cena again this year in Stockholm.

38
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know he was an E3 attendee.

39
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:04,963
[SPEAKER_03]: He was there last year.

40
00:03:05,023 --> 00:03:06,285
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a wrestler.

41
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:08,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to stalk celebrities, C-list celebrities?

42
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:10,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I might bump into a few more celebrities.

43
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:11,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

44
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:15,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I bumped into Kojima the year before and I bumped into Miyamoto last year and this is literal.

45
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:15,994
[SPEAKER_02]: E3 Outpost.com

46
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:46,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't want to meet us?

47
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:16,369
[SPEAKER_02]: or a dollar.

48
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:21,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's cut the crap and get to how our gaming week was.

49
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:22,491
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

50
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye everybody!

51
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:27,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I guess that's it for the show.

52
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:31,054
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

53
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:35,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a buttload of Ragnarok yesterday and I played a buttload of Ragnarok today.

54
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of doing the rest of my homework today, I played a buttload of Ragnarok.

55
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:41,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so responsible.

56
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:43,978
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is that it was due two weeks ago.

57
00:04:46,444 --> 00:05:01,648
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I tried to play some Kingdom Hearts last weekend because I wasn't here last week because one of my really good friends and a listener of ours, DisneyPunk10, came up to hang out for my birthday week, which was drunken.

58
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:05,549
[SPEAKER_03]: More drunken.

59
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:06,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

60
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about Dave and Buster's on last week's show.

61
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,671
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good times.

62
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:14,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually did not get as insanely drunk this year as I did the year before because now I'm grown up.

63
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:19,499
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll never be a grown-up.

64
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:20,500
[SPEAKER_02]: You still play games.

65
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Games are for kids.

66
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:22,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

67
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:26,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, I'm joking.

68
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:27,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't playing with my dolls.

69
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:33,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, oh, you know, though, I found out a piece of... Oh, yeah, I saw Silent Hill three times.

70
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:36,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I went on last Friday.

71
00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:38,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we didn't get to hear your feedback on the movie.

72
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:38,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you liked it.

73
00:05:39,284 --> 00:05:39,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

74
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:44,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I went Friday, and then I went again Sunday, and then I went Wednesday, and I drugged Julie with me.

75
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:45,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible to see a movie too much?

76
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:46,187
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

77
00:05:46,867 --> 00:06:01,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go again, hopefully, before we go to E3, and I think I'm going to see it while I'm at E3, because one of the DDR Freak moderators is from South America, and he hasn't... It's not opening there for a while, so we're going to probably bring him to see it at some point.

78
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:02,252
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

79
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:03,232
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

80
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:07,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot.

81
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:08,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, Silent Hill.

82
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:10,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, Red Pyramid.

83
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:12,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, you could kill me.

84
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:13,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd die happy.

85
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:18,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that they actually got an actual actor to play him in The Janitor.

86
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:23,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he moves so fluidly.

87
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, oh yeah, I could watch that for hours.

88
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:33,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody at the, I was out at the club last night and some of us were talking about Silent Hill the movie and somebody called him Triangle Head.

89
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,350
[SPEAKER_02]: That made me laugh.

90
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Triangle Man.

91
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:38,871
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly where my mind went to.

92
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:43,512
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we know we're both dorks because my mind went exactly, Triangle Man, Triangle Man.

93
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:46,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you catch that reference, you too, my friend, are a dork.

94
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:52,794
[SPEAKER_03]: There actually is a LiveJournal icon where it had Pyramid Head as Triangle Man.

95
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:58,343
[SPEAKER_03]: and what was the guy in the second game, James, as Person Man.

96
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:01,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, games, gaming week.

97
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:03,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.

98
00:07:03,607 --> 00:07:09,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit level 43 for my job class, which means I have seven more stupid job levels to go.

99
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:11,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that you are a certified dork.

100
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:17,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm not the one who was on... This is your gaming week, not my gaming week.

101
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:17,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

102
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Drama!

103
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:20,741
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

104
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,923
[SPEAKER_02]: This is definitely an off night for us

105
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:32,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, and then I, um, I, uh, worked on, uh, something I'm doing for Kingdom Hearts fan art opportunity with a friend.

106
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:36,186
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, I've actually been sort of artsy gamey.

107
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:42,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of trying to get back into my old, uh, you know, nerd hobbies, but school is sort of kicking my ass.

108
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:45,049
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I'm doing a flashlight based off a video game.

109
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not sure if I'm going to do Silent Hill like I've done all my other homework.

110
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:50,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I might just do something.

111
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:52,272
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a Guardian Legend tribute page in Flash?

112
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:52,772
[SPEAKER_02]: That would rock.

113
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:57,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

114
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:11,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wants to do my flash homework for me?

115
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:12,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Not me.

116
00:08:12,716 --> 00:08:15,877
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week, I played Final Fantasy XI a little bit.

117
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:17,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, more than a little bit.

118
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:19,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a lot.

119
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:22,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI.

120
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:24,498
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of like on a little mini break.

121
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking a little mini vacation from it.

122
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:34,800
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, the only really new game I played was Project Gotham Racing 3, which isn't really a new game because it was an Xbox 360 launch title.

123
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,160
[SPEAKER_02]: But Loki let me borrow it.

124
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's about like the 50th racing game I've played on the 360.

125
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:41,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Download the Speed Pack.

126
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:43,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to mention Dan downloaded the Speed Pack.

127
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:44,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't that cost points?

128
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:48,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, however, the cars that are in it are so worth it.

129
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:49,994
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is the Evo 8MR.

130
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:51,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

131
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:51,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

132
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:53,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I feel about this game still.

133
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:54,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the game.

134
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:55,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's pretty.

135
00:08:56,236 --> 00:09:00,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's got a great interface, and I think it's a very fluid interface, and it's great to get into.

136
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:08,760
[SPEAKER_02]: But the racing itself, I found you have to use different tactics in this game than you do in other types of games like Ridge Racer, and that kind of threw me at first.

137
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,740
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on your car, too.

138
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand why it's not a game about drifting.

139
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:16,065
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a street race type thing.

140
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:17,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a different style.

141
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:20,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to read up on GameFAQs how to do a frickin' turn right in that game.

142
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:23,380
[SPEAKER_02]: My suggestion is actually to do the in-car view when you're playing.

143
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,962
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually does make a difference.

144
00:09:42,746 --> 00:09:43,207
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

145
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:46,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I get a little motion sick sometimes, too, because that view makes me all weird.

146
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:48,310
[SPEAKER_03]: The interiors, though, are perfect.

147
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:48,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

148
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,550
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty looking.

149
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I did notice a flaw, being that I'm a Lancer freak, since I drive a Lancer.

150
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:58,996
[SPEAKER_03]: They did the interior for the Evo IX inside the Evo VIII MR. Wow, that's nerdy.

151
00:09:59,236 --> 00:09:59,796
[SPEAKER_03]: That is nerdy.

152
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:03,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty awesome you know that, though, because I would never have noticed that.

153
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that you can test drive all the cars, though, even the expensive ones.

154
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a car person.

155
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:10,310
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go to the expensive ones and do the test drive so you can see how they play.

156
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,690
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun game and I will probably play more of it.

157
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I just was a little like, whoa, this is a little bit different.

158
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,211
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love that it's so fluid.

159
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,952
[SPEAKER_02]: It is definitely one of the better racing games on 360.

160
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:26,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of surprised because I didn't think it would be the type of game I'd like, but I really enjoyed it.

161
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:35,455
[SPEAKER_02]: But for all these people that like to loop racing games in one big pile and call them all just like racing games, you know, like they're all the same.

162
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:37,135
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to play this

163
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:43,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Then play something with guns like Full Auto or Burnout, something where destruction is the main factor.

164
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:49,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And then play something like, well I know Initial D is not on 360, but maybe something like Ridge Racer where it's more about drifting.

165
00:10:50,557 --> 00:10:53,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see the big differences between these racing games.

166
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to loop the Project Gotham series in with the Gran Turismo series.

167
00:10:57,844 --> 00:10:59,205
[SPEAKER_03]: They play similarly.

168
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,008
[SPEAKER_03]: More on the realistic side of car motion than...

169
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I have yet to purchase that, I feel that I don't need it My brain is 50 million years old

170
00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:30,397
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a bad, you want to get it down.

171
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:30,837
[SPEAKER_03]: One.

172
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:32,717
[SPEAKER_02]: You want your brain age 20 is the lowest you can go.

173
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:33,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 21 now.

174
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:34,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 21 now.

175
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:35,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on it.

176
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,439
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some gaming news?

177
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Big news in the gaming industry.

178
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge, huge news in the gaming industry this week.

179
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:46,704
[SPEAKER_02]: from Sony.

180
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:56,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony has upgraded their PSP firmware to 2.70 to include Flash support.

181
00:11:57,088 --> 00:11:58,809
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I hear it sucks.

182
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:02,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear the Flash support really stinks on this.

183
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they say what Flash supports?

184
00:12:05,731 --> 00:12:06,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Flash 8?

185
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:12,874
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they just say the release notes say now you can play Macromedia Flash content.

186
00:12:12,894 --> 00:12:13,494
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

187
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:16,115
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not really supposed to save the content.

188
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,776
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't play content that was saved.

189
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:20,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Although supposedly people have found a way around that.

190
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,758
[SPEAKER_02]: You access it from your browser.

191
00:12:21,998 --> 00:12:26,800
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's no way to launch just... Let's say you want to download Homestar Runner movies and watch them at your convenience.

192
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,700
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really do that.

193
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,021
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really work that way.

194
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:31,622
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say that Flash games...

195
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:36,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Run, like I was reading web forums, Flash games run like two frames a second, like they're horrible.

196
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:40,307
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the Flash support is there, but needs a little bit of improvement.

197
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:41,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I can work around that.

198
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:42,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll see.

199
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows, we might be seeing our own content in Flash.

200
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly, although I don't know, we may want to wait until this gets better.

201
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:51,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Because from what I'm hearing, the feedback, not worth the upgrade.

202
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:54,635
[SPEAKER_02]: The feedback I'm hearing on the forums is this is not worth the upgrade right now.

203
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:56,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't mind testing it.

204
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:58,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I really would not mind designing something and testing it out.

205
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you still have my PSP, so I guess you could do that.

206
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

207
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,671
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be coming with us to E3.

208
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:03,131
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

209
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:04,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

210
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:07,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's plenty of reasons why everybody should bring their PSPs to E3.

211
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:10,475
[SPEAKER_03]: My husband still has not got me my PSP.

212
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:11,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

213
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:13,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think we're getting a camcorder.

214
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:15,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you need to get a PSP out of that, too.

215
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:20,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else has been added in the PSP 2.7 upgrade.

216
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,503
[SPEAKER_02]: UMD video L and R button has been added because you can disable the channel skip feature with the L and R buttons.

217
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:29,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've done this before.

218
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:31,825
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too easy to accidentally knock those buttons or hit them.

219
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:33,606
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can disable that.

220
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:41,330
[SPEAKER_02]: And AAC is now playable on the PSP as well, which is a very popular iTunes and Apple codec.

221
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.

222
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:47,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to check that out, all you have to do is just on your PSP you can update the firmware.

223
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:57,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, for those of you guys that like to do controversial things on your PSP which involve downgrading your firmware, 2.7 will lock all that out because obviously they fixed all those loopholes.

224
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,732
[SPEAKER_02]: So something to consider before you do this.

225
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:02,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Where one loophole closes, another one opens

226
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:55,085
[SPEAKER_02]: but I would say perhaps I think there's actually truth in this I think maybe they will keep quiet about the price I think they just want to show the goods and I think this whole blu-ray kind of factor will probably determine I mean because we still really don't know like is are the games going to be blu-ray I mean they say it is is it movies I mean are we still I mean certainly websites out there are talking about one way or the other but we still really don't know what Sony's plan really is for that

227
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:58,649
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think until that's been established, it's really hard to get the price.

228
00:14:58,729 --> 00:14:59,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

229
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:01,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I could be wrong.

230
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:09,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like them to release the price, and I'm pretty sure it's going to be $399 to be competitive with Xbox 360, even though rumor is they're going to drop price.

231
00:15:10,183 --> 00:15:10,423
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

232
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:12,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we'll know for sure until the end of summer.

233
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:13,864
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems fair.

234
00:15:14,284 --> 00:15:18,787
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty much as much as the PS2 was released for when it came out.

235
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:21,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And wasn't the PlayStation 1 about that much when it came out, too?

236
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:22,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe at least $2.99.

237
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,151
[SPEAKER_03]: No, yeah, it was around $2.99.

238
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:30,315
[SPEAKER_03]: If I do remember correctly, because I didn't have one, I was there when someone bought one, because it lived in my dorm room.

239
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:31,916
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't have a TV.

240
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:37,200
[SPEAKER_02]: But, well, the price of a dollar has gone, you know, different directions since then, so...

241
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:45,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, one other thing that we can expect on Sony is a very popular franchise's sequel, correct?

242
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:46,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Luminous 2.

243
00:15:47,202 --> 00:15:47,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

244
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:54,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like there was a mention into this video.

245
00:15:55,887 --> 00:16:01,650
[SPEAKER_03]: They were saying that it's probably going to be officially revealed at E3.

246
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,672
[SPEAKER_03]: They made a mention of Luminous 2 is coming out, so maybe we'll see that at E3.

247
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:06,887
[SPEAKER_02]: New music!

248
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:42,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Special Art New Unlockable Content Free Porn It'll be Luminous with Sony characters

249
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:04,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Other huge, huge, huge news in the gaming industry this week from Microsoft.

250
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And Microsoft has said that they are going to be previewing E3.

251
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, they haven't said this.

252
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:11,261
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a rumor.

253
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:18,247
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know Microsoft's going to show Halo 3 because they've got to derail the thunder from whatever Sony's going to bring, whatever Nintendo's going to bring.

254
00:17:18,427 --> 00:17:19,668
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got to derail the thunder.

255
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:23,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So Halo 3, they are saying, is going to be previewed at the conference this

256
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:25,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor has it it's a two minute video.

257
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:27,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing playable yet, kids.

258
00:17:27,294 --> 00:17:27,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

259
00:17:27,974 --> 00:17:34,900
[SPEAKER_02]: But a video will still be enough to kind of get that, just get that cravens in for Halo.

260
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:42,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure that you bring Kleenex to wipe the drool that the fanboys are going to be having over the game.

261
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:43,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

262
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:44,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out.

263
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:46,209
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a good one at E3.

264
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:51,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, another franchise with a sequel that could be shown at E3.

265
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:53,607
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some pretty cool news.

266
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:59,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like Red Octane and Harmonix are looking for indie musicians to put their stuff in Guitar Hero 2.

267
00:18:00,232 --> 00:18:12,541
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a contest at BeAGuitarHero.com so musicians can send in their own hard rock, heavy metal stuff that features a lead guitar as an mp3 format.

268
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:16,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the Internet for them to review.

269
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:25,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero 2 was announced actually this month, saying there'd be new play modes, new track list, 40 licensed, 15 unlockable, independent.

270
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, Gibson's got support in this one again.

271
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:34,323
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that the contest is really neat because we were introduced to a lot more.

272
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:39,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say there's actually more bands local to, I guess, this whole area.

273
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:43,947
[SPEAKER_03]: But it introduced people to a lot more bands.

274
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:45,275
[SPEAKER_03]: The Hidden Track

275
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:04,982
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

276
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:06,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember reading something about that, that there's a hidden track.

277
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:09,606
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually posted up on our website.

278
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:14,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I just had a brain fart and forgot the name of it.

279
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,452
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's Triple something.

280
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:19,074
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another indie band.

281
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:23,537
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a song that I recognized as a classic rock song.

282
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:25,839
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds more like progressive rock.

283
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was put up on Kotaku.

284
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,442
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a video there.

285
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:32,125
[SPEAKER_03]: The song is called...

286
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:35,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, poo.

287
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:37,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it's not something you can access, though.

288
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,067
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to use code.

289
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:41,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not like up, up, down, down, left, right code.

290
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:43,010
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to use like a... Triplet.

291
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:43,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

292
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Triplet's the name of the song.

293
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:45,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

294
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:48,012
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to use a... What's a code thing on PlayStation called?

295
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:50,374
[SPEAKER_02]: CodeShark, GameShark, CodeBreaker, whatever.

296
00:19:50,414 --> 00:19:50,874
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those things.

297
00:19:51,014 --> 00:19:52,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Pro Action Replay.

298
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:52,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

299
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:57,178
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did... Even though the video is not the greatest, this song is freaking hard.

300
00:19:57,918 --> 00:20:01,920
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way I'd ever be able to play that one, but it's an expert level song.

301
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Why'd they take it out, I wonder?

302
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero Guitar Hero

303
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:21,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

304
00:20:44,642 --> 00:20:51,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to more news about the PSP, LocoRoco has a demo that's downloadable in Japan.

305
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:57,094
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can check that out at www.jp.playstation.com.

306
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you actually have to navigate a little ways to get there.

307
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:00,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

308
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:19,015
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

309
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:58,879
[SPEAKER_03]: and then their first DS game Panzer Tactics DS which is World War 2 again turn-based strategy Pacific Storm which is sort of turn-based and real-time

310
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, it's more World War II.

311
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:05,182
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like they're sort of stuck in the 1940s there for a bit.

312
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:09,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there will be Heroes of Annihilated Empires.

313
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:15,066
[SPEAKER_03]: The open beta has actually just launched for that one.

314
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:22,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dark Star 1, which is a sci-fi action game about a pilot trying to solve a mystery.

315
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:23,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.

316
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:24,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds pretty cool.

317
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:27,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'll definitely look up, you know, anything.

318
00:22:27,627 --> 00:22:31,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I personally am not into the strategy games, but I love anything historical.

319
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:34,290
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always go buy some of those.

320
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if I don't care about the game itself, I go to look and see how accurate are they.

321
00:22:39,212 --> 00:22:40,052
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, look at the demos.

322
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:40,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's pretty cool.

323
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:41,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

324
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:43,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I like games that teach you something.

325
00:22:44,454 --> 00:22:48,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it kind of reminds me of, you really got a kick out of that story a while back.

326
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:50,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the MMO that had the crucified guy?

327
00:22:50,357 --> 00:22:52,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Roman Empire one.

328
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:52,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

329
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:54,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?

330
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:59,321
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a Marvel Action RPG that makes me happy!

331
00:22:59,661 --> 00:22:59,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

332
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:07,706
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually says it's going to have more than the standard X-Men franchise that we typically see as of late.

333
00:23:08,407 --> 00:23:11,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Activision and Raven are going to put this out on damn near everything.

334
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:15,251
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm sure if you've got the system, it'll play it.

335
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:17,573
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, short of like the PC Engine or something.

336
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:18,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

337
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:21,868
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be called Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

338
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:28,073
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be out actually on the next gen and current gen ones, including the handheld PC.

339
00:23:28,714 --> 00:23:35,260
[SPEAKER_03]: More than 20 playable Marvel characters with Spider-Man, Wolverine, Blade, Captain America, supposed to be out in the fall.

340
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:44,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's supposed to be the usual, you know, not just the fate of the Earth, but the entire Marvel Universe thing.

341
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:45,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Choose your own adventure.

342
00:23:46,587 --> 00:23:49,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, I pushed the red button, the world explodes type of thing.

343
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,310
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a new combat system.

344
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,390
[SPEAKER_03]: You have air combat ground underwater.

345
00:23:54,991 --> 00:23:59,152
[SPEAKER_03]: You have power charging melee weapons.

346
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:00,253
[SPEAKER_03]: You have...

347
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:07,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only are you going to be able to choose your characters, you actually will make your team of different Marvel characters.

348
00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:10,279
[SPEAKER_03]: You will have different things to represent them.

349
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:13,001
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be really customizable.

350
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:18,765
[SPEAKER_03]: It's as far as your actions actually determine how the game goes.

351
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:22,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I think sort of fable in that respect.

352
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:28,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I have the release dates for this month.

353
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:30,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually...

354
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:31,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Gugu Gugu Nugget

355
00:24:48,433 --> 00:25:02,963
[SPEAKER_03]: me and my Katamari on the 5th coming out on PSP Metroid Prime Hunters on the DS, Samco Museum 50th Anniversary on the GameCube Pac-Man World 3 on the various collection of random systems Rainbow Islands Revolution I thought that would make you happy

356
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:12,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm from the DS Well, no, because I thought that you liked Bubble Bobble Rainbow Islands It's just like that, for real?

357
00:25:12,188 --> 00:25:32,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is Oh my gosh, okay, now I am excited Well, it's just because I knew that you were a big Bubble Bobble fan Yeah, I didn't realize it would be the same thing, that's cool Yeah, I'm actually just pulling this up on Eurogamer And it is Bubble Bobble Rainbow Islands Very cool Yeah, see, I love Rainbow Islands, that was a great game

358
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:46,788
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Rogue Galaxy on the PS2 and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter Coming out They actually get Brain Age on the 19th It's fun Check out last week's show if you want my review

359
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:54,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming back stateside, not a whole lot shaking up the industry this week as far as release dates go.

360
00:25:55,343 --> 00:25:58,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably because of the upcoming E3, there's not a very big calendar.

361
00:25:59,046 --> 00:26:00,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably until we get into June.

362
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:02,589
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there are a couple games to look out for.

363
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:06,352
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2 has Gallop Racer 2006 on May 2nd.

364
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:11,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360 doesn't really have anything coming until the end of this month.

365
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:16,300
[SPEAKER_02]: The next big release scheduled is Rockstar Games Table Tennis on May 22nd.

366
00:26:17,304 --> 00:26:19,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Boy Advance, Dr. Sudoku, if you really want it, May 1st.

367
00:26:38,752 --> 00:26:44,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean you're going to have the really hard part where you have to, you know, feel your... It is for real Top Gun based on the old movie.

368
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:45,455
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can believe it.

369
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'm thinking of the old Top Gun Nintendo game.

370
00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:50,237
[SPEAKER_03]: That game pissed me off so much.

371
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:51,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I could never land.

372
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:52,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd crash.

373
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:54,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder how similar it is to the old NES one.

374
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:55,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to check that out.

375
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen really the only... We need more games, I think, that played like that.

376
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:00,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Like After Burner.

377
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:01,662
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a new After Burner.

378
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:05,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Except I think I'm going to get the Stegages.

379
00:27:05,143 --> 00:27:06,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you got a new Outrun, so you never know.

380
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we did pick up Outrun 2006.

381
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,381
[SPEAKER_03]: How was it?

382
00:27:09,941 --> 00:27:11,242
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually is pretty cool.

383
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:16,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I was making pizza the other day, and Dan's like, my girlfriend keeps getting pissed off at me.

384
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:21,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yeah, and your wife's going to get pissed off at you if you keep screaming about it.

385
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:24,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was pretty cool.

386
00:27:24,428 --> 00:27:31,072
[SPEAKER_03]: He showed me the little demo mode, and it played with a remix of Magical Sound Shower, which made me all happy because that's my favorite Outrun song.

387
00:27:34,785 --> 00:27:39,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to a follow-up story, but this is a follow-up of something like months old.

388
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:42,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we talked about this, and I don't even know if we talked about it on a podcast.

389
00:27:42,447 --> 00:27:43,688
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have been on one of our live shows.

390
00:27:43,888 --> 00:27:46,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't call it a following-up as much as a, oh, we caught up to it.

391
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:47,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda.

392
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:54,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is the thing, is that there was an article in the Mercury, I believe it was the San Jose Mercury News that published this.

393
00:27:55,411 --> 00:27:56,251
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the...

394
00:27:58,212 --> 00:27:58,272
[SPEAKER_02]: E.A.

395
00:27:58,292 --> 00:27:58,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Spouse Erin Hoffman

396
00:28:16,685 --> 00:28:38,026
[SPEAKER_02]: and her husband was Leander Hasty and he was working on Battle for Middle Earth for Electronic Arts and she's the one that posted the story and he is not working at EA anymore obviously, he's a game designer over at Playable Productions and kind of interesting, I guess what happened is that he was part of this class action lawsuit about the unpaid overtime against EA, so...

397
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:41,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they took their story public, finally, so, very interesting.

398
00:28:41,945 --> 00:28:48,430
[SPEAKER_03]: While the legal proceedings are going on, they actually advise not to go public with identity or any type of information because it could hurt the case.

399
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:54,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure, I have to be honest, I can't remember if it was settled already or not.

400
00:28:55,474 --> 00:29:05,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at the time that we read the article, they were actually in the... Right, right, right, no, definitely at the time the article first came out, it wasn't, so...

401
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:08,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to read over it real quick here.

402
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:28,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know from having friends who have sued the facilities that they work for, they're advised not to have any contact with, that is if they've left the company, not to have any contact with anybody who still works there and not to really reveal the details going on until after it's been settled.

403
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:32,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would think that that's been why it's so long getting that name out.

404
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you have it, a little follow-up.

405
00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:36,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Grr, argh

406
00:30:08,044 --> 00:30:12,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wouldn't say this is so much of an FU as it was an almost FU.

407
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this was really the only thing that's got me at all frustrated this week.

408
00:30:16,103 --> 00:30:17,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Is on my way here...

409
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:25,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm driving along in my lane and some guy in a truck decides that he wants to be in my lane and that he'll conveniently not see me.

410
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:28,883
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's pulling into my lane and I'm beeping like, you, move on!

411
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:29,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay out of my lane!

412
00:30:29,924 --> 00:30:30,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm driving here!

413
00:30:31,404 --> 00:30:45,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he ends up... I slow way down, you know, but I can't really brake because there's this car right behind me so I'm slowing way down to try to get behind this guy and he ends up just swinging on in and smacking the front side of my car.

414
00:30:46,193 --> 00:30:46,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

415
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:55,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually had started to steer away at that point, you know, so I was all, you know, he knocked my window in, my rearview mirror just pulled inside, rolled down my window, popped it back out.

416
00:30:56,534 --> 00:31:04,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And he eventually, like, you know, hours later, pulls over, you know, and I was like, dude, you are giving me your registration right now.

417
00:31:04,975 --> 00:31:07,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gets this look on his face like, oh, shit.

418
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:14,057
[SPEAKER_03]: So, because, you know, anyone who messes with my car gets the wrath of Sakura brought down upon them.

419
00:31:15,477 --> 00:31:16,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my car.

420
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:34,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my car a whole lot so I'm looking at the side of the car and there's oil all over the side and I'm like oh god oh god oh god so I took out my little hand wipes and start wiping the oil off to see what the damage looks like there's no damage my car is fine

421
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:36,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I go look at his car.

422
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:37,219
[SPEAKER_03]: His truck is fine.

423
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:39,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, dude, you are so lucky your car's filthy.

424
00:31:40,361 --> 00:31:41,102
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, what?

425
00:31:41,122 --> 00:31:43,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, put your registration back in your car.

426
00:31:43,123 --> 00:31:43,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need it.

427
00:31:43,804 --> 00:31:44,585
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't hurt my car.

428
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:46,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Your car's so greasy, my car slid right off it.

429
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:52,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And I showed him, and he's like, whoa, your car doesn't look like it's damaged at all.

430
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:53,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, it's not.

431
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:57,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I didn't really care if, you know, maybe reverse damage had been done.

432
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,796
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, don't worry about it.

433
00:31:58,816 --> 00:31:59,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go on.

434
00:31:59,316 --> 00:31:59,917
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, okay.

435
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:01,298
[SPEAKER_03]: F.U.

436
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:02,499
[SPEAKER_03]: to A Lack of Sleep

437
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I can step on your foot for you.

438
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:32,776
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thank you.

439
00:32:33,457 --> 00:32:33,877
[SPEAKER_02]: F you, Jamie.

440
00:32:35,017 --> 00:32:35,777
[SPEAKER_02]: F you right back, Rob.

441
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:40,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been getting a lot of sleep this week, so F you to that.

442
00:32:41,358 --> 00:32:42,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.

443
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a good one.

444
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:46,120
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the fact that I am traveling to L.A.

445
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:53,481
[SPEAKER_02]: next week for my day job, so I'm flying down there and coming back Friday, and then I drive back down on Monday for E3.

446
00:32:54,302 --> 00:32:55,322
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have a caravan, though.

447
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:57,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I still don't have my confirmation for, either.

448
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,123
[SPEAKER_02]: My emails are being ignored at this point.

449
00:32:59,663 --> 00:33:00,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that interesting?

450
00:33:01,451 --> 00:33:02,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like you should follow my advice.

451
00:33:02,972 --> 00:33:05,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's see.

452
00:33:06,014 --> 00:33:08,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll have to be reporting from the front door because they won't let me in.

453
00:33:08,996 --> 00:33:09,336
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

454
00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:14,379
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you're in and Matt's in, but me, no love for Rob.

455
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I see how it is.

456
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,441
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give you a taser.

457
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:25,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll just have to hack things like my DS because apparently you can hack your DS like you can make it look like a DS Lite.

458
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:32,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can't obviously make the shell of it look like a DS Lite, but you can make the screen a lot brighter like a DS Lite.

459
00:33:32,987 --> 00:33:34,268
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some hacks.

460
00:33:34,568 --> 00:33:38,632
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hacked firmware that you can put out there and get on there.

461
00:33:38,812 --> 00:33:46,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually was a story that originally broke over on the forums over at gbadev.com.

462
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:52,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So it actually came originally from a Spanish board is where this came from.

463
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:53,904
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of interesting.

464
00:33:53,924 --> 00:33:56,567
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's pictures that prove it that show that it got brighter.

465
00:33:56,647 --> 00:33:59,189
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're interested in that, check that out.

466
00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:02,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when the Afterburner came out on the GBA.

467
00:34:03,953 --> 00:34:06,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have a GBA with an Afterburner.

468
00:34:06,815 --> 00:34:10,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the Afterburner in my GBA except I loaned my GBA out to a friend who was gameless.

469
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:12,200
[SPEAKER_03]: My GBA is pink.

470
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:14,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine is virginal white.

471
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually own a pink video game system.

472
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:20,323
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my one requisite girly thing.

473
00:34:20,343 --> 00:34:20,803
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

474
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:22,524
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, just a quick follow-up.

475
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:25,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're writing emails right now, you can cut that out.

476
00:34:25,486 --> 00:34:28,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I did find the quick follow-up there to the EA spouse story.

477
00:34:29,188 --> 00:34:33,190
[SPEAKER_02]: There were indeed, those lawsuits were indeed already settled.

478
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:38,353
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually three class action lawsuits and it was already, or they actually weren't settled.

479
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:44,196
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they won settlements in three class action lawsuits the developers did.

480
00:34:44,477 --> 00:34:44,957
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is.

481
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:47,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I love when the little man wins.

482
00:34:50,845 --> 00:34:51,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

483
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:58,975
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura is not going to be reading any mail but she does have a few words of advice for those of you guys that want to send in mail for next week's show.

484
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:01,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, send more of it.

485
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand I've got three weeks worth of email that's come through.

486
00:35:08,563 --> 00:35:14,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I've replied to as many of them as I could within the limited scope of my homework beating me over the head with a sledgehammer.

487
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:16,890
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to start fresh.

488
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:20,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise I will read emails regularly.

489
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:21,901
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

490
00:35:47,723 --> 00:35:51,268
[SPEAKER_02]: We really want to hear your opinions and your thoughts on things.

491
00:35:51,288 --> 00:35:52,289
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're really after.

492
00:35:52,549 --> 00:36:00,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, make sure that if you have an email address that any way remotely resembles anything spam,

493
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:06,829
[SPEAKER_03]: When you send us an email in the subject line, make sure you put OLR and then your subject.

494
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:14,993
[SPEAKER_03]: That way, even if it comes into the spam folder, I at least see that we have OLR in the title and I can check it.

495
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:20,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that has a spam thing on it, I instantly delete it.

496
00:36:20,175 --> 00:36:20,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

497
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:25,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I check the email for us at various locations.

498
00:36:25,957 --> 00:36:29,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not want to run the risk of infecting systems that are not my property.

499
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:32,297
[SPEAKER_03]: If I infect my own system, I can fix it.

500
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:33,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you should be doing work at work.

501
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I never said I was at work.

502
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:37,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just teasing you.

503
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:39,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a good girl and I do my job.

504
00:36:41,227 --> 00:36:42,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, guess what?

505
00:36:45,431 --> 00:36:48,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Koei has revealed their E3 lineup.

506
00:36:48,662 --> 00:36:53,384
[SPEAKER_02]: and in that lineup, Guitar Man Live is coming to the PSP in America.

507
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,825
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be shown at E3.

508
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:55,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Koei.

509
00:36:56,486 --> 00:36:58,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Exciting news indeed, don't you think?

510
00:36:58,707 --> 00:36:59,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Koei.

511
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:00,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I love them too.

512
00:37:00,788 --> 00:37:06,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Koei is another one of my favorite companies that not many people think of.

513
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very happy to hear that.

514
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:10,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they'll just bring us another KO Flying Squadron.

515
00:37:10,753 --> 00:37:11,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I'll be happy.

516
00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:13,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm trying to remember the other stuff they have coming to E3.

517
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:16,575
[SPEAKER_02]: They also announced some other things that are supposed to be coming to E3.

518
00:37:16,675 --> 00:37:17,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Dynasty Warriors.

519
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're doing Dynasty Warriors.

520
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:21,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

521
00:37:22,315 --> 00:37:29,764
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well then let's go over now to DarkSakura to talk about how she likes to surf the internet, you know, sometimes when she's at work.

522
00:37:29,804 --> 00:37:30,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at work.

523
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:32,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes when she's at friends' houses.

524
00:37:32,827 --> 00:37:37,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And she finds great websites to share with you guys in her website of the week.

525
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:40,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually didn't find this one on my own.

526
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:51,822
[SPEAKER_03]: This one was given to us in the middle of my Flash class, and I figured Flash pisses me off so much, I'm sure we have many other listeners who are just as pissed off by Flash as I am.

527
00:37:52,362 --> 00:37:54,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not, by the way, piss me off as much as Illustrator does.

528
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:58,726
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this site is called Actionscript.org.

529
00:37:59,447 --> 00:38:05,651
[SPEAKER_03]: For anyone who has to deal with a lot of in-depth Flash stuff, by now you are familiar with how frustrating working with scripts can be.

530
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Programming in your Stop Here program

531
00:38:08,732 --> 00:38:11,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Play, and then stop on frame, kiss my butt.

532
00:38:11,434 --> 00:38:14,537
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is the perfect site.

533
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:26,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only does it have tutorials on how to set up a lot of your different flash actions, also outlined from beginning to advanced level, it has your actual scripts that you need to make all this stuff work, and working examples.

534
00:38:27,908 --> 00:38:31,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these are also listed with movie files to go along with them to show you how to do it.

535
00:38:31,912 --> 00:38:32,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

536
00:38:33,076 --> 00:38:33,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool site.

537
00:38:33,597 --> 00:38:39,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only that, it's also available in, I believe, Japanese, Dutch, French, Russian, and Serbian.

538
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:44,644
[SPEAKER_02]: For anybody that needs those Serbian tools.

539
00:38:44,684 --> 00:38:47,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sometimes you need to read your sites in Serbian.

540
00:38:47,806 --> 00:38:48,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

541
00:38:48,206 --> 00:38:49,767
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be from that area of the world.

542
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:50,227
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

543
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,229
[SPEAKER_02]: You provide a world-class service to our listeners.

544
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:53,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

545
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I do.

546
00:38:58,067 --> 00:39:01,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, we got one last story for you guys tonight.

547
00:39:01,428 --> 00:39:02,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you have any last minute stories.

548
00:39:02,888 --> 00:39:03,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything.

549
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:04,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any last minute stories?

550
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:06,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing video game related, but this is just nerd happy.

551
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:07,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what?

552
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:12,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I found out that the movie theater at Arden Fair Mall is playing Spaceballs next week.

553
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:14,772
[SPEAKER_02]: They do cult movies every Thursday.

554
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:16,212
[SPEAKER_03]: They're playing Spaceballs.

555
00:39:16,912 --> 00:39:18,113
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Spaceballs the game.

556
00:39:18,193 --> 00:39:21,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to go to that, except I'm going to be out of town, which makes me sad.

557
00:39:21,513 --> 00:39:23,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to Fandango my tickets.

558
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:27,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I will dance the Fandango with my credit card.

559
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,201
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

560
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:42,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Indiana Jones.

561
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:12,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sense because there's supposedly an Indiana Jones movie new one coming on the way too.

562
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:14,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Harrison Ford is too old for this stuff.

563
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:17,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but Sean Connery is rumored to be reprising his role, which might be cool.

564
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Sean Connery.

565
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, who doesn't love Sean Connery?

566
00:40:20,103 --> 00:40:23,425
[SPEAKER_03]: He could be a quadruple amputee and he would still be hot.

567
00:40:23,445 --> 00:40:23,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

568
00:40:25,527 --> 00:40:28,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that's about all the stories this week.

569
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can't think of anything else.

570
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:32,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really think of anything else either, so I guess that's it.

571
00:40:32,993 --> 00:40:33,594
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done with the show.

572
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:34,555
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um...

573
00:40:35,293 --> 00:40:35,994
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

574
00:40:58,311 --> 00:40:59,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's going to do it for another week of Orange Sounds Radio.

575
00:41:00,012 --> 00:41:05,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Radio even on weeks when we're not fully staffed.

576
00:41:05,555 --> 00:41:06,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate it.

577
00:41:06,815 --> 00:41:07,896
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you guys.

578
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:10,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget to check out our big preview show next week for E3.

579
00:41:11,438 --> 00:41:15,460
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't forget to come by the E3 outpost and check that out as well.

580
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, chocolate and a dollar.

581
00:41:18,261 --> 00:41:18,901
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important.

582
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:21,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, I forgot.

583
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:25,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo renamed their revolution to the Wii.

584
00:41:25,665 --> 00:41:26,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Wii!

585
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:27,746
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next week!

586
00:41:30,652 --> 00:41:33,213
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

587
00:41:33,413 --> 00:41:36,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

588
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:46,137
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information on our live and podcast programs, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next week!

589
00:41:52,499 --> 00:41:55,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, kill the music, kill the music, kill the music.

590
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:57,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Whee!

591
00:41:58,781 --> 00:41:59,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Whee!

592
00:41:59,462 --> 00:42:00,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, look.

593
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

594
00:42:22,697 --> 00:42:23,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Avoid the emo part.

595
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:23,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have...

596
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:49,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Gaming Community,

597
00:43:14,364 --> 00:43:27,715
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have called it the Nintendo Poopmonger, and as long as there's a sexy Zelda game on it, or an innovative Mario title, or some kawaii Animal Crossing game, or hopefully a new innovative franchise, y'all will be anxious to play it.

598
00:43:28,216 --> 00:43:32,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, Nintendo is not after your business so much this time, and while yes, I agree,

599
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,822
[SPEAKER_02]: They need it to be successful.

600
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:40,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the fact stated above that you'll play a good game regardless of the name of the system it's on.

601
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:49,255
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole Wii thing is highly symbolic of the push Nintendo is trying to make to break the gamer stereotypes and get this thing playable by anyone.

602
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:53,980
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weird name, but honestly, you had to expect something like this from Nintendo, hmm?

603
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wait and see how good the games are.

604
00:43:56,582 --> 00:43:56,963
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

605
00:43:58,043 --> 00:44:01,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can say Wii is stupid because come play with my Wii Wii, haha.

606
00:44:02,024 --> 00:44:05,185
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just as easy to make fun of a sex box or a gay station.

607
00:44:05,745 --> 00:44:07,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Potty brains can ruin anything.

608
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:08,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, I know.

609
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:10,367
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

610
00:44:10,407 --> 00:44:17,449
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first saw it, though, if there hadn't been a pronunciation guide with it, I was thinking, well, maybe they... Why?

611
00:44:17,629 --> 00:44:24,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking, well, I was thinking why because that actually would make sense in my head because why is like yay in Japanese.

612
00:44:25,678 --> 00:44:33,123
[SPEAKER_03]: WAI, I thought that if they were going to spell it, it would be Y, but we... I'd be like, it's cute, it's Y!

613
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:34,984
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I get what they're doing.

614
00:44:35,185 --> 00:44:36,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hate the name so much.

615
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:38,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we had the Pico, remember?

616
00:44:38,267 --> 00:44:39,087
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was for kids.

617
00:44:39,247 --> 00:44:45,051
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird, yeah, but Nintendo isn't... You know, Nintendo's trying to reach a broad audience.

618
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:49,834
[SPEAKER_02]: They want that buzzword, that easy word this time, because they're not trying to reach just gamers.

619
00:44:49,874 --> 00:44:50,555
[SPEAKER_02]: They want everybody.

620
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:53,297
[SPEAKER_02]: They want Oprah to come out and talk about her Wii.

621
00:44:54,678 --> 00:44:54,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii!

622
00:44:55,842 --> 00:44:57,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been calling it the Nintendo Wii.

623
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:02,284
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, all those potty jokes and things, Nintendo, I think, hopes to transcend that.

624
00:45:02,684 --> 00:45:09,566
[SPEAKER_02]: By, if they can get the name Wii out there, then, you know, I'm going to go home and play with my Wii is not going to have the same connotation that it does today.

625
00:45:09,926 --> 00:45:12,187
[SPEAKER_02]: If Nintendo can get over that, then they've been truly successful.

626
00:45:12,227 --> 00:45:13,187
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can't, they're doomed.

627
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:19,749
[SPEAKER_03]: We've actually been having a bit of discussion about this on one of the moderator boards I'm on about how

628
00:45:21,334 --> 00:45:22,455
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just been back and forth.

629
00:45:22,555 --> 00:45:26,737
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all decided, though, that they had to have been on heroin when they came up with the name.

630
00:45:28,898 --> 00:45:30,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

631
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:40,824
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like something, to me, and I'm speculating here, it seems like something that kind of Nintendo Japan probably came up with, and America, once they kind of gave their reasons, America was like, okay, we could do that.

632
00:45:41,525 --> 00:45:45,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize everybody's like, why didn't you just keep the revolution?

633
00:45:45,607 --> 00:45:47,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't you just keep the revolution?

634
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:47,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

635
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:52,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how difficult that might be to pronounce for some people outside the US?

636
00:45:53,336 --> 00:45:55,138
[SPEAKER_02]: You might as well call it the Nintendo Prell.

637
00:45:55,538 --> 00:45:58,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you guys will get that joke.

638
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they wanted something very simplistic.

639
00:46:03,043 --> 00:46:04,504
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole thing they're going for.

640
00:46:04,724 --> 00:46:07,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Revolution also has a negative context in some places.

641
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:10,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the game Dance Dance Revolution.

642
00:46:10,348 --> 00:46:13,470
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't call it that in Europe because of the term revolution.

643
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:13,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

644
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:14,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody gets offended by it.

645
00:46:15,392 --> 00:46:30,731
[SPEAKER_02]: they call it Dancing Stage which is a completely different name so I think Revolution wouldn't have worked worldwide and I don't think there's been a console that's changed their name from country to country in a while I mean yes we had Famicom, NES, Megadrive, Genesis but you know in the past

646
00:46:31,195 --> 00:46:32,075
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

647
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, we had the Pico.

648
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:05,662
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a system named After Food.

649
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:12,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're seriously not going to buy this because you don't want a Wii in your house... I don't mind having a Wii in my house.

650
00:47:12,405 --> 00:47:18,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Then Nintendo would make the following suggestions to you based on a recent rebuttal argument that was made on some websites out there.

651
00:47:19,288 --> 00:47:20,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fly Virgin Atlantic.

652
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:22,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't drink naked juice.

653
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go to Yahoo or Google because those are all silly names too.

654
00:47:29,504 --> 00:47:30,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

655
00:47:30,644 --> 00:47:31,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I get what Nintendo's doing.

656
00:47:31,365 --> 00:47:39,429
[SPEAKER_03]: In the world of advertising, being that that's part of what I am in school, you have to do something that's going to be easily memorable.

657
00:47:40,529 --> 00:47:45,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that people are going to talk about and is immediately catching.

658
00:47:46,612 --> 00:47:48,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've got all three of that already.

659
00:47:49,093 --> 00:47:50,794
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you forget Wii?

660
00:47:51,194 --> 00:47:53,175
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everybody is talking about it because, oh my god, Wii!

661
00:47:54,396 --> 00:47:54,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

662
00:47:55,396 --> 00:47:56,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, on top of that...

663
00:47:57,634 --> 00:47:58,477
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy.

664
00:47:59,058 --> 00:47:59,600
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there.

665
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,222
[SPEAKER_03]: It's we.

666
00:48:01,365 --> 00:48:05,366
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Nintendo did a very risky, ballsy thing with this.

667
00:48:05,406 --> 00:48:11,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not trying to say that, oh, I may be a little bit of a Nintendo fanboy, but I'm just a gaming fanboy.

668
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:12,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I like all the systems.

669
00:48:13,009 --> 00:48:16,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think Nintendo's just taking a big risk with this.

670
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an interesting choice, but it's a risky choice.

671
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:21,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're taking a big risk with this.

672
00:48:22,251 --> 00:48:26,353
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody said that this next-gen console war is going to be an easy fight, right?

673
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:27,553
[SPEAKER_02]: They can change their mind too.

674
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:28,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they will.

675
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:36,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the internet is convinced there's been stories that, well, the Wii's not trademarked so it's not the real name and all this other conspiracy theories.

676
00:48:37,304 --> 00:48:39,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I don't really see that happening.

677
00:48:40,326 --> 00:48:42,487
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the name of the console, so enjoy it.

678
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:49,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I do have to say that I think Sony has really had the best idea overall with keeping a single name and just adding a number.

679
00:48:51,744 --> 00:48:53,065
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

680
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:57,687
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm in Nintendo's shoes, I can say it's the same thing.

681
00:48:57,747 --> 00:48:58,607
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same old thing.

682
00:48:58,647 --> 00:49:00,228
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just another freaking game thing.

683
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:01,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another game system.

684
00:49:01,368 --> 00:49:03,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo doesn't want that this time.

685
00:49:03,129 --> 00:49:07,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo wants something bigger than your typical game system.

686
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,651
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end, it's a game system.

687
00:49:10,352 --> 00:49:10,532
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

688
00:49:10,552 --> 00:49:15,314
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to escape the fact that they are still marketing games.

689
00:49:16,394 --> 00:49:21,037
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not trying to market to non-gamers, they're trying to make non-gamers into gamers.

690
00:49:22,197 --> 00:49:24,719
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, they're trying to convert the masses.

691
00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:33,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remember, as you post to message forums your angst about how much you hate the name Wii, please remember the golden rule of gaming.

692
00:49:34,024 --> 00:49:36,625
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the system, it's the games that are on it.

693
00:49:36,745 --> 00:49:39,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

694
00:49:39,547 --> 00:49:41,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know what?

695
00:49:42,268 --> 00:49:45,110
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's good games on this, you'll be proud to be a Wii owner.

696
00:49:47,423 --> 00:49:48,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have always wanted a wee.

697
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:50,926
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime... Oh my god, wee!

698
00:49:53,868 --> 00:49:55,269
[SPEAKER_02]: And now for the real outro.

699
00:49:58,572 --> 00:50:01,034
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

700
00:50:01,354 --> 00:50:04,677
