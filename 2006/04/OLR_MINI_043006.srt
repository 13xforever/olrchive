00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,400
Tonight, April 30th, 2006, we talk about the new PSP firmware.

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,680
What are we all assuming Microsoft might show at E3?

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:31,880
And we get excited about Luminous 2 News!

4
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,080
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
Radio.

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,520
We are that video game podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know.

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,720
My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,320
You might know me as Sky.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,880
Joining me as always in that corner over there, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
Yo, what up?

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
How you doing?

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,880
I've just been going wee all day. I'm so happy.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,380
Alright, you're just in a good mood.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,380
Yeah.

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,880
Alright, and not here tonight. Don't say hello to Loki because he's not here.

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,880
He who is about to die.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,380
That's right, he's getting married which means his soul is forever gone.

18
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,380
Hey, I still have my soul and I'm married, but I married a gamer.

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:18,380
Alright, so in all seriousness, congratulations to Matt and Ellie who are tying the knot on Sunday night.

20
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,380
Yay!

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,660
on Saturday this week, so not joining us tonight is the chat room and the skype line, it's

22
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,660
just us.

23
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,660
Oh darn.

24
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,560
So we're not calling this an official episode, this is a mini episode.

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,380
I like episodelet.

26
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,500
An a little episodelet?

27
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,420
I like that name too, we'll call it an episodelet.

28
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,420
Like a nugget.

29
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,420
Yes, a little episodelet.

30
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,380
That's kind of gross, it's a nugget.

31
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,300
So this is our little episodelet for this April 29th, 2006.

32
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,420
There will be no Part B this week, so please don't be looking for it.

33
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,540
We're only going to do about half a show tonight.

34
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,740
It's been kind of a slow news week, too, all things considered.

35
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,900
I guarantee you Wednesday, where's Part B?

36
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Yeah, I know.

37
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,620
They'll be posting, where's Part B?

38
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,220
There's no Part B this week.

39
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,540
I'll put up a picture of a face sticking out of tongue and go, there's your Part B.

40
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:12,820
No, but we'll be back, of course, next week with a huge E3 preview show, everything we

41
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,500
We can't wait to do it, E3.

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,860
And of course, we'll be back the week after that as well.

43
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,620
We're not going to be taking any shows off during E3.

44
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,660
In fact, you get bonus shows.

45
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,700
Here's the deal.

46
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,020
We're actually going to be doing podcasts each day of the show, like we did last year.

47
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,060
However, we're going to be working with our partner, AllGames.com, to produce these shows.

48
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,340
They're actually going to be letting us use their studios over at the Arena Interactive

49
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,400
Lounge to be taping the shows, so it's going to be pretty cool.

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,120
So you'll actually be able to hear us taping all this live on AllGames.com, 6.30-ish each

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
day of the show.

52
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,880
I'm saying 6.30-ish because we're going to be the first show on right after the expo

53
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
is over.

54
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,760
So we may end up getting to start a little early and we may end up having to start a

55
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
little late.

56
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,520
All technical things aside, but the goal time is 6.30-ish.

57
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,960
I may find John Cena again this year and stalk him.

58
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,160
I didn't know he was an E3 team.

59
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
He was there last year.

60
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
He's a wrestler.

61
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,480
Are you gonna stalk celebrities, C-list celebrities?

62
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,160
I might bump into a few more celebrities, who knows?

63
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,880
Like I bumped into Kojima the year before, and I bumped into Miyamoto last year, and

64
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
this is literal.

65
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,600
I think the best celebrity I met last year was probably Togo, who did the music in, well,

66
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,760
some of the music in BB&A 2D action.

67
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,840
A certain other famous person who I wanted to talk to was off talking to somebody else

68
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,400
while we were doing an interview that never happened.

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,220
Also regarding the E3

70
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,520
Outpost, you can actually come see us in person if you want. It's a

71
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,180
open invite party. You don't have to be an E3 attendee to go.

72
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,340
It's E3outpost.com if you want the details on that.

73
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,700
Who doesn't want to meet us? We're gonna be there and

74
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,580
Scott Rubin, the infamous G4 guy, is gonna be there.

75
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,460
I think Gamer Andy is doing something as well if you guys read his blog.

76
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,420
so he's gonna be doing something as well. So it should be a good time. It's just gonna be an internet

77
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,580
celebrity fest. It's gonna be a podcast orgy.

78
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,240
Yes it is. Yes, with no nudity though. No. Because we don't need any of that. None of the naked, but

79
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,320
you know, people wanna bring me chocolate. We can have a chocolate podcast orgy, that'll be fun.

80
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,380
Chocolate podcast orgy. Alright. That's it, anyone who comes and meets me has to bring me dark chocolate.

81
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,660
Or a dollar. Or a dollar. Alright, let's cut the crap and get to

82
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,220
how our gaming week was. Dark Sockro. You cut the crap?

83
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,220
Bye everybody!

84
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,220
Oh, I guess that's it for the show!

85
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,220
No.

86
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,220
How was your gaming week, DarkSaga?

87
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,220
Um, I played a buttload of Ragnarok yesterday.

88
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,220
And I played a buttload of Ragnarok today.

89
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,220
Instead of doing the rest of my homework today,

90
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,220
I played a buttload of Ragnarok!

91
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,220
I'm so responsible.

92
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,220
The thing is that it was due two weeks ago.

93
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,220
Um, no.

94
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,220
I tried to play some Kingdom Hearts last weekend,

95
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,220
because I wasn't here last week,

96
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:58,000
Because one of my really good friends and a listener of ours Disney Punk 10 came up to hang out

97
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,420
for my birthday week, which was a

98
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
drunken and

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,600
More drunken good times. I talked to I talked about Dave and Busters on last week's show is good times

100
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,520
Yeah, I actually did not get as insanely drunk this year as I did the year before because now I'm grown up

101
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:21,320
up you'll never be a grown-up you still you still you still play games games are

102
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:30,720
for kids hey obviously I'm joking I wasn't playing with my dolls yeah oh you

103
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,400
know though I found out a piece of it oh yeah so Silent Hill three times I went

104
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,520
on last Friday oh we didn't get to hear your feedback on the movie obviously you

105
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,520
liked it oh yeah I went Friday and then I went

106
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,060
against Sunday and then I went Wednesday and I drug Julie with me is it possible

107
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,860
to see a movie too much no I'm gonna go again hopefully before we go to e3 and I

108
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,420
think I'm gonna see it while I'm at e3 because I'm one of the DDR freak

109
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,500
moderators as from South America and he hasn't this not opening there for a

110
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,180
while so we're gonna probably bring him to see it at some point that's cool but

111
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,180
I

112
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:13,980
Forgot oh, yes, I know oh my god red pyramid. I was like you could kill me. I'd die happy I

113
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,900
Thought that they actually got like an actual actor to play him in the janitor cuz like he moves so

114
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,100
Fluidly, it's just like oh, yeah, I could watch that for hours

115
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,360
Somebody at the I was I was out at the club last night and some of us were talking about

116
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,920
Silent Hill the movie and somebody called him triangle head that made me

117
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,120
laugh because I think it's exactly exactly where my mind went to this is

118
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,360
how we know we're both dorks cuz my mind went exactly triangle man triangle man

119
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,720
you know and if you catch that reference you too my friend is a live journal icon

120
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,240
where I had had pyramid head as triangle man and what was the guy in the second

121
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:03,880
game James mm-hmm as person man all right games gaming okay yeah um I I hit

122
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,360
level 43 for my job class which means I have seven more stupid job levels to go

123
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,560
or you that you are a certified dork hey I'm not the one who was on this is your

124
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,360
gaming week not my gaming week okay drama no this is definitely an off

125
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:29,920
night for us um but yeah and then I am I worked on something I'm doing for

126
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,240
Kingdom Hearts fan art opportunity with a friend so I've actually been sort of

127
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,720
artsy gamey sort of trying to get back into my old you know nerd hobbies but

128
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,520
school sort of kicking my ass but I think I'm doing a flashlight based off a

129
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,120
video game I'm just not sure if I'm gonna do Silent Hill like I've done all

130
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,280
my other homework I might just do something about a guardian legend

131
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,120
tribute page in Flash, that would rock. Though it has to be a digital poem. So I think I'm

132
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,120
just gonna do like some like really stupid poem that have like art that has nothing to

133
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,120
do with it, like half of those do. Alright. Hooray for Flash, Nott. Anything else? Who

134
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,000
wants to do my Flash homework for me? Not me, my gaming week, I played Final Fantasy

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
11 a little bit, actually more than a little bit, I played a lot, like Monday, Tuesday,

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,280
Wednesday, I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI, so I'm kind of like on a little mini

137
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,560
break, I'm taking a little mini vacation from it, but otherwise, the only really new game

138
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,480
I played was Project Gotham Racing 3, which isn't really a new game because it was an

139
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,300
Xbox 360 launch title, but Loki let me borrow it, and so it's about like the 50th racing

140
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,560
game I played on the 360.

141
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Download the Speed Pack.

142
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,600
I forgot to mention Dan downloaded the Speed Pack.

143
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Doesn't that cost points?

144
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Yeah, however, the cars that are in it are so worth it. One of them is the EVO 8MR.

145
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Maybe. I don't know. I don't know how I feel about this game still.

146
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I like the game. I think it's pretty. I think it's got a great interface.

147
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,600
And I think it's a very fluid interface and it's great to get into.

148
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,600
But the racing itself, I found you have to use different tactics in this game than you do in other types of games like Ridge Racer.

149
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
And that kind of threw me at first.

150
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
It depends on your car too.

151
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,840
Yeah, and I understand why is that it's not a game about like drifting. It's more of like a street race type thing

152
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,840
It's it's just a different style of

153
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,460
Racing but it really threw me having played all these other racing games where you know

154
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,500
Release the gas while you turn then hit the gas so you kind of do that drifting

155
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,300
You're not really I mean you can do that in Project Gotham, but I slam into walls every time

156
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,140
So you have to really alter the strategy

157
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,940
I had to read up on game facts how to do a frickin turn right in that game

158
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,840
My suggestion is actually to do the in-car play of you. Mm-hmm when you're playing it actually does make a difference

159
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,760
I you know what maybe I get a little motion sick sometimes too because that view makes me all like weird

160
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,280
I get all the more perfect

161
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,380
I know it's pretty low as a flaw being that I'm a Lancer freak since I drive a Lancer

162
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:01,280
They did the interior for the evo 9 inside the evo 8mr. Wow, that's nerdy. That is nerdy pretty awesome. You know that though

163
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:07,560
I like that you can test drive all the cars though, even the expensive ones.

164
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,280
You can go to the expensive ones and do the test drive so you can see how they play.

165
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,120
It's a fun game and I will probably play more of it.

166
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,420
I just was a little like, whoa, this is a little bit different, but I love that it's

167
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,260
so fluid.

168
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,680
It is definitely one of the better racing games on 360.

169
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,080
I was kind of surprised because I didn't think it would be the type of game I like, but I

170
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
really enjoyed it.

171
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,460
for all these people that like to loop racing games in one big pile and call

172
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,380
them all just like racing games you know like they're all the same you need to

173
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,840
play this then play something like with guns like full auto or burnout something

174
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,220
where destruction is the main factor and then play something like initial well I

175
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,140
know initial D is not on 360 but maybe something like Ridge Racer where it's

176
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,340
more about drifting and you'll see like the big differences between these racing

177
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,620
games. I would have to loop the Project Gotham series in with like the Grand

178
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,580
Turismo series. It plays similarly. More on the realistic side of

179
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,580
of car motion than... Probably fair to say that Project Gotham was probably

180
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,780
designed as a

181
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,620
direct competitor. So, anyway. That was pretty much my game of the week. I didn't play a whole

182
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,020
lot besides that. I've been doing my brain training every day though.

183
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,300
I'm getting good. I hadn't yet to purchase that. I feel that I don't need it.

184
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,780
Oh, I think you need to be doing the little quiz on mine and then we'll see

185
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,900
how old your brain is and then that might

186
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,700
Might change your mind. My brain is 50 million years old.

187
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,860
No, that's a bad, you want to get it down. One. You want your brain age 20 is the lowest you can go.

188
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,980
I'm 21 now. I'm 21 now. I'm working on it.

189
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:42,620
How about some gaming news? Big news in the gaming industry. Huge,

190
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,840
huge news in the gaming industry this week from Sony.

191
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,300
Sony has upgraded their PSP Flash

192
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,700
firmware, I'm sorry, their PSP firmware to 2.70

193
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,020
to include flash support.

194
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,800
However, I hear it sucks. I hear the flash support

195
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,300
really stinks on this.

196
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,380
Did they say what flash supports? Is it Flash 8?

197
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,260
No, they just say the the release notes say now you can play Macromedia flash

198
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,580
content but here's the thing

199
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,160
you're not really supposed to save the content, like you can't play content that

200
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,860
was saved

201
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,020
although supposedly people have found a way around that like you access it from

202
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,860
your browser

203
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,740
but there's no way to like launch just like, let's say you want to download

204
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,860
Homestar Runner movies and watch them at your convenience,

205
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,620
you can't really do that. It doesn't really work that way. And they say that

206
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,860
Flash games

207
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,500
run like, I was reading web forms, Flash games run like two frames a second, like

208
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,180
they're horrible.

209
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,380
So the Flash support is there but needs a little bit of improvement.

210
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,340
I can work around that. Yeah, we'll see. Who knows, we might be seeing our own content in

211
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:44,980
Flash.

212
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,340
Possibly, although I don't know, we may want to wait till this gets better

213
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,700
because this, from what I'm hearing, the feedback, not worth the upgrade.

214
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,780
the feedback I'm hearing on the forums is that this is not worth the upgrade right now

215
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,580
I wouldn't mind testing it. I really would not mind designing something and testing it out

216
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,780
Well you still have my PSP so I guess you could do that

217
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,700
Yes I do. It will be coming with us to E3

218
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,580
Alright. Sounds good. Yeah there's plenty of reasons why everybody should bring their PSPs to E3

219
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,660
My husband still has not got me my PSP

220
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,500
Really?

221
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,100
Because I think we're getting a camcorder

222
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,580
Well you need to get a PSP out of that too

223
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,580
Let's see what else has been added in the PSP 2.7 upgrade

224
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,580
UMD video L and R button has been added because you can disable the

225
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,220
channel skip feature with the L and R buttons.

226
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,500
I've done this before like it's too easy to accidentally knock those buttons or

227
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:31,940
hit them.

228
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,020
So you can disable that.

229
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,300
AAC is now playable on the PSP as well which is a very popular

230
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,480
iTunes and Apple codec so that's pretty cool.

231
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,580
So if you want to check that out all you have to do is just on your PSP you can

232
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,500
update the firmware. Keep in mind

233
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,980
for those you guys that like to do controversial things on your PSP which

234
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,580
involve downgrading your firmware

235
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,260
2.7 will lock all that out because obviously they fixed all those loopholes

236
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:57,700
so

237
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,060
something to consider before you do this. Where one loophole

238
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,060
closes another one opens. That is very true. Speaking of Sony

239
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,580
rumor is that Sony is going to keep their mouth shut when it comes to the

240
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,140
price

241
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,180
of the PlayStation 3 at this year's E3.

242
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,260
Reports are saying on CNN

243
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,940
is that Sony is not going to talk about the price of their console until the end of

244
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,580
the summer

245
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,940
at the earliest. Now, of course, the only time when this can really be confirmed

246
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,140
is E3,

247
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,500
but I would say perhaps I think there's actually truth in this.

248
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,020
I think maybe they will keep quiet about the price.

249
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,220
I think they just want to show the goods, and I think this whole

250
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,940
Blu-ray kind of factor will probably determine. I mean, because we still really

251
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,100
don't know, like,

252
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,260
Are the games gonna be Blu-ray? I mean, they say it is.

253
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,780
Is it movies? I mean, are we still... I mean, certainly websites out there are talking

254
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,980
about one way or the other, but we still really don't know what Sony's plan

255
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,900
really is for that. So I think until that's been established, it's really hard to

256
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,720
get the price. So we'll see.

257
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,720
I mean, I could be wrong. I'd like them to release the price, and I think I'm

258
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,060
pretty sure it's going to be

259
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,300
$399 to be competitive with the Xbox 360, even though rumor is they're gonna drop

260
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,820
price.

261
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,420
but I don't think we'll know for sure till end of summer it seems

262
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,580
it seems fair. That was pretty much as much as the PlayStation was

263
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,420
the PS2 was released for when it came out. And wasn't the PlayStation 1 about that

264
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,500
much when it came out too?

265
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,580
Maybe at least $2.99? No, yeah it was around $2.99 if I remember correctly because I

266
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,420
I didn't have one I was there when someone bought one because it lived in my dorm room

267
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,540
he didn't have a TV. But

268
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,500
well the the price of a dollar's gone you know different directions since then so

269
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:44,660
Alright, one other thing that we can expect on Sony is a very popular franchise's sequel,

270
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,660
correct?

271
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,660
Lumines2.

272
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,660
Awesome.

273
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:55,940
It sounds like there was a mention into this video.

274
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:02,060
They were saying that it's probably going to be officially revealed over at E3.

275
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,820
They made a mention of Lumines2 is coming out, so maybe we'll see that at E3.

276
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,100
I think there's some early screenshots that have leaked of Luminous 2, so I'm pretty sure

277
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,660
we're going to see some of that at E3, that would be pretty awesome, at least I hope so.

278
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,180
I want a playable demo at E3, I don't want no movie.

279
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:21,020
I want a playable demo, and I want it to have music that was as good as the first one.

280
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,420
Absolutely, yeah, that's one.

281
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,780
And plus, the other question about Luminous 2 is, what exactly are they going to change?

282
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,780
Because there's...

283
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,780
Why change anything?

284
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,780
It's good.

285
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,620
Yeah, but then, you know, what makes me have to own Luminous 2 if I own Luminous 1 and

286
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
it's the same game?

287
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,620
New music!

288
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,460
music worth special art new unlockable content there's got to be something

289
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,220
there's gonna there's gotta be foreign even like a couple new blocks but just

290
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,500
don't make the same mistakes the Tetris franchise did I mean I guess at the same

291
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,440
time Tetris DS is still Tetris right it'll be luminous with like Sony

292
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:02,740
characters we'll see other huge huge huge news in the gaming industry this

293
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:08,080
week from Microsoft and Microsoft has said that they are going to be

294
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,200
previewing E3 well actually they haven't said this is just a rumor but you know

295
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,400
Microsoft you know they're gonna show Halo 3 because they've got to derail the

296
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,520
Thunder from whatever Sony's gonna bring whatever Nintendo is gonna break they've

297
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,520
got to derail the Thunder so Halo 3 they are saying is going to be previewed at

298
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,120
the conference rumor has it it's a two minute video nothing playable yet kids

299
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,980
Sorry, but a video will still be enough to kind of get that just get that cravens in for

300
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,880
Make sure that you bring Kleenex. Mm-hmm to wipe the drool

301
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,200
Yeah that in it, you know that the fanboys are going to be having over the game

302
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,520
Absolutely. So check that out. That's gonna be a good one at e3

303
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,880
Jamie another franchise with a sequel that which could be shown at e3

304
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,080
This is some pretty cool news. Looks like Red Octane and Harmonics are looking for

305
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,740
indie musicians to put their stuff in Guitar Hero 2. There is a contest at

306
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,920
BeAGuitarHero.com so musicians can send in their own hard rock heavy metal

307
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,700
stuff that features a lead guitar over you know as an mp3 format over the

308
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,280
internet for them to review. Guitar Hero 2 was announced actually this month

309
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:26,280
saying there'd be new play modes, a new track list, 40 license, 15 unlockable, independent,

310
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,120
and of course, Gibson's got support in this one again.

311
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,260
But I think that the contest is really neat because it's gonna, you know, we were introduced

312
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:39,040
to a lot more, there, I would say there's actually more bands local to, I guess, this

313
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:45,440
whole area, but it introduced people to a lot more bands, you know, I just think that

314
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,280
that was a really, a really neat thing.

315
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,480
I think it was really cool of Red Octane to put all those independent bands right alongside

316
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,900
the classic hits, you know, and the fact that they kept Freezepop made me giddy too, because

317
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,400
you know I love me some Freezepop.

318
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,280
So I hope they come back for the sequel, they better.

319
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,440
There was that news, though, about the Hidden Track.

320
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,040
That's true, I remember reading something about that, that there's a Hidden Track.

321
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:13,600
So it was actually posted up on our website, one, and you know, I just had a brain fart

322
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,200
and forgot the name of it, but it's triple something.

323
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:24,200
It's another indie band. It's not a song that I recognized as a classic rock song.

324
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
It sounds more like progressive rock.

325
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Yeah, it was put up on Kotaku. There's a video there.

326
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,200
The song is called...

327
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Oh, poo.

328
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
Now, it's not something you can access, though.

329
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
You have to use codes.

330
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Well, not like up, up, down, down, left, right codes. You have to use like a...

331
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Triplet.

332
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Yeah.

333
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Triplet's the name of the song.

334
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,080
What's a code thing on PlayStation called?

335
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,960
CodeShark, GameShark, CodeBreaker, whatever, one of those things.

336
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,680
Pro Action Replay, but I did, even though the video is not the greatest,

337
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,240
this song is freaking hard. There's no way I'd ever be able to play that one, but

338
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,960
it's an expert level song.

339
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,720
Why did they take it out, I wonder? I think just because the style of the song doesn't

340
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,760
necessarily fit

341
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,200
the styles of the rest of the game. I mean, then again, we've got Freeze Pop in there, so

342
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,400
hello? But it is very, very, you know, progressive

343
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,240
rock. I mean, it's a good song. It's a really good song.

344
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,640
But what happens is that the song Guitar Hero in the game,

345
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,560
it actually replaces it. It's not gonna

346
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,420
corrupt your shapefile or anything. You can just reset the game, but when

347
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,760
you put in the code, when you pull up the song list, Triplet will be

348
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,440
selectable.

349
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,520
And it is pretty vicious. It is vicious.

350
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,400
Well, check that out. Well, Kotaku has a little more details in the actual

351
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,240
codes that you need.

352
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,360
They have the codes up, and they also have a video of someone playing it. Awesome.

353
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:52,460
Moving on to more news about the PSP, LocoRoco has a demo that's downloadable in Japan.

354
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,900
So you can check that out at www.jp.PlayStation.com.

355
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,560
Now you actually have to navigate a little ways to get there.

356
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,140
Loki said he would try and get this on OLRPSP.com though for you guys this week because apparently

357
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:10,060
even though the demo is only available in Japan right now, it works on the US PSP is

358
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,200
what he said.

359
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,920
So if you don't mind reading a little bit of Japanese,

360
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,400
you can play a demo of LocoRoco, a new PSP game.

361
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,480
Awesome.

362
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,880
Speaking of traveling the world, DarkSakura

363
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,400
likes to once in a while snoop in on new sites

364
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,200
from around the world and pick up stuff from the UK.

365
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
So DarkSakura, and of course, news over there,

366
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,640
effects, what goes on over here, et cetera, et cetera.

367
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,040
What'd you pick up from the globe this week?

368
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,360
Well, it looks like CDV's putting up their lineup at E3.

369
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,480
The game's coming out.

370
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,060
Warfront the Turning Point which is World War 2 real-time strategy there's

371
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:50,280
also War Leaders Clash of Nations and then their first DS game Panzer Tactics

372
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:57,340
DS which is World War 2 again turn-based strategy Pacific Storm which is sort of

373
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,940
turn-based and real-time then again it's more World War 2 it sounds like they're

374
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,860
sort of stuck in the 1940s there for a bit also there will be Heroes of

375
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:15,220
Annihilated Empires the open beta has actually just launched for that one and

376
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:21,700
Darkstar one which is a sci-fi action game about a pilot trying to solve a

377
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,780
mystery hmm sounds pretty cool I mean I'll definitely look up you know

378
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,200
anything I mean I personally am not into the strategy games but I love anything

379
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,640
historical so I always go buy some of those even even if I don't care about

380
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,460
about the game itself I go to to look and see how accurate are they you know

381
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,200
look at the demos I think that's pretty cool cool I like games that teach you

382
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,800
something yeah and it kind of reminds me of you really got a kick out that story

383
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:54,680
a while back remember the MMO that had the crucified guy yeah yeah well guess

384
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:00,000
what hmm there's gonna be a Marvel action RPG that makes me happy awesome

385
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,240
it actually says it's gonna have more than the standard X-Men franchise that

386
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,740
we typically see as of late. Activision and Raven are gonna put this out on

387
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,720
damn near everything so I'm sure if you've got the system it'll play it you

388
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,280
know short of like the PC Engine or something. So it's going to be called

389
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,560
Marvel Ultimate Alliance it will be out actually on the next-gen and current

390
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,360
gen ones including the handheld PC and more than 20 playable Marvel characters

391
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,920
with a like spider-man Wolverine blade Captain America supposed to be out in

392
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:41,520
the fall basically it's supposed to be the usual you know not just the fate of

393
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,840
the earth but the entire Marvel Universe thing choose your own adventure oh no I

394
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,800
push the red button the world explodes type of thing it's got a new combat

395
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:58,640
system you have air combat ground underwater you have power charging melee

396
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,280
weapons you have not only are you going to be able to choose your characters you

397
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,260
actually will make your team a different Marvel characters you will have

398
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:13,180
different things to represent them it's supposed to be really customizable it's

399
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:18,260
it's as far as your actions actually determine the app that you know how the

400
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:26,460
game goes. I think sort of fable, you know, in that respect. And, of course, I have the

401
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,460
release dates for this month. Actually, there's not really any days left for

402
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,340
this month, so I will give the ones for the first week of May. How does that sound?

403
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:42,220
Okay. We have coming out on the first Beetle King, we have, okay, I've never

404
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,620
heard of this, but Goo Goo Noggett on DS. No, Goo Goo Goo Goo Noggett is what it

405
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:53,140
says me and my Katamari on the fifth coming on PSP Metroid Prime Hunters on

406
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,580
the DS Sam could museum 50th anniversary on the GameCube Pac-man world 3 on the

407
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,180
various collection of random systems Rainbow Islands revolution I thought

408
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:07,860
that would make you happy maybe I'm from the DS well no because I thought that

409
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:13,380
you'd liked oh is it is it it's just like that for real I think it is oh my

410
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,220
gosh okay now I am excited well it's just because I knew that you were a big

411
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,780
Big Bubble Bobble fan. Yeah, I didn't know I didn't realize it would be the same thing. That's cool. Yeah

412
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:29,540
Um, I actually just pulling this up on Eurogamer and it is Bubble Bobble Rainbow Islands. Very cool

413
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,920
Yeah, see I love Rainbow Islands. That was a great game

414
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,140
We have Rogue Galaxy on the ps2 and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

415
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,140
Coming out. All right. They actually get brain age on the 19th

416
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:48,460
It's fun, check out last week's show if you want my review.

417
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:54,020
Coming back stateside, not a whole lot shaking up the industry this week as far as release

418
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,700
dates go.

419
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,460
Probably because of the upcoming E3, there's not a very big calendar, probably until we

420
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,460
get into June.

421
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,780
However, there are a couple games to look out for.

422
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:09,980
PlayStation 2 has Gallop Racer 2006 on May 2nd, not Xbox 360, Xbox 360 doesn't really

423
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,820
have anything coming until the end of this month.

424
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,860
The next big release scheduled is Rockstar Games Table Tennis on May 22nd.

425
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,920
However, if you're a PC gamer, this is a good week for you guys.

426
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,580
You guys are getting Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter on May 2nd, and then you're also

427
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,700
getting Desperados 2 as well on May 2nd.

428
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:36,220
Over on the DS, you are getting Top Gun on May 1st, and Game Boy Advance Dr. Sudoku,

429
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,820
if you really want it, May 1st.

430
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,820
Top Gun?

431
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,160
Does that mean you're going to have the really hard part where you have to, you know, fuel

432
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,160
It is for real Top Gun based on the old movie, if you can believe it.

433
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Actually, I'm thinking of the old Top Gun Nintendo game.

434
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,160
That game pissed me off so much, because I could never land. I'd crash.

435
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,160
I wonder how similar it is to the old NES one. I might have to check that out.

436
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,160
I haven't seen, really, the only...

437
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,160
We need more games, I think, that played like that, like After Burner.

438
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,160
We need a new After Burner. Except I think I'm going to get the Sega Ages.

439
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Well, you got a new Outrun, so you never know.

440
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Actually, we did pick up Outrun 2006.

441
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,160
How is it?

442
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:14,180
it actually is pretty cool and Dan gets I was making pizza the other day and

443
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,320
Dan's like my girlfriend keeps getting pissed off at me I was like yeah and

444
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,240
your wife's gonna get screaming about it but not it and I thought it was pretty

445
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,920
cool he showed me the little demo mode and it played with like a remix of

446
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,840
magical sound shower which made me all happy because that's my favorite Outrun

447
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:38,160
song hmm moving on to a follow-up story but this is a follow-up of something

448
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,380
like months old I think we talked about this and I don't even know if we talked

449
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,280
about it on a podcast it might have been one of our live shows I wouldn't call

450
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,860
the following up as much as a we caught up to it kind of well this is the thing

451
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,100
is that there was an article in the mercury I believe it was the San Jose

452
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:59,300
mercury news that published this it was in the section there it was talking

453
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:04,060
about a follow-up to the EA spouse you might remember this she had a live

454
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:09,780
journal and the live journal had talked about all the you know over time things

455
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,700
and shady stuff that was going on at Electronic Arts well she's been revealed

456
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:19,500
and her name is Erin Hoffman and her husband was Leander Hastie and he was

457
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,740
working on Battle for Middle Earth for Electronic Arts and she's the one that

458
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,940
posted the story and he is not working at EA anymore obviously he's a game

459
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,080
designer over at Playable Productions and kind of interesting I guess what

460
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,400
happened is that he was part of this class action lawsuit about the unpaid

461
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,400
overtime against EA so then they took their story public finally so very

462
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,880
interesting while the legal proceedings are going on they actually advise not to

463
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,080
go public with identity or any type of information because it could hurt the

464
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,760
case I'm not sure I have to be honest I can't remember if it was settled already

465
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,120
or not I think at the time that we read the article they were actually in the

466
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:05,040
Right, right, right, no, definitely at the time the article first came out, it wasn't.

467
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,840
So I'm just trying to read over it real quick here.

468
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:15,640
Well I know from having friends who have sued the facilities that they work for, they're

469
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,960
advised not to have any contact with, that is if they've left the company, not to have

470
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,920
any contact with anybody who still works there and not to really reveal the details going

471
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,540
until after it's been settled so I would think that that's been why it's so long

472
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:36,600
giving that name out hmm well there you have it a little follow-up kind of

473
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,300
always fun to learn the identities of secret people we have our own secret

474
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,460
identities here at Orange Lawns Radio as well we are very angsty people sometimes

475
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,500
we get really mad and ticked off and that's why we have this segment on the

476
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,700
show called the FUs of the week where we have the chance to spread a little hate

477
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,700
to all the kids of America, right Jamie?

478
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700
Grr, argh.

479
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,700
Well, I wouldn't say this is so much of an F.U. as it was an almost F.U.

480
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,700
because this was really the only thing that got me at all frustrated this week

481
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,700
is on my way here, I'm driving along in my lane

482
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,700
and some guy in a truck decides that he wants to be in my lane

483
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,460
lane and that he'll conveniently not see me so he's pulling into my lane I'm

484
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:33,780
beeping like you stay out of my lane I'm driving here and so he ends up I slow

485
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,380
way down you know but I can't really break his his car right behind me so I'm

486
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,860
slowing way down to try to get behind this guy and he ends up just swinging on

487
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,940
in and smack in the side at the front side of my car and I actually had

488
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,820
started to steer away at that point you know so I was all you know you knocked

489
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,380
my window in my rearview mirror just pulled inside rolled down my window popped it back

490
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:01,900
out and he eventually like you know hours later pulled over you know and I was like

491
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,220
dude you are giving me your registration right now and he gets this look on his face like

492
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:13,200
oh shit so um because you know anyone who messes with my car gets the wrath of sakura

493
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,580
brought down upon them I love my car just to tell everybody I love my car a whole lot

494
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:25,740
So I'm looking at the side of the car and there's oil all over the side and I'm like, oh god

495
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,220
Oh god

496
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,940
Oh that says I took out my little hand wipes and start wiping the oil off to see what the damage looks like

497
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,420
There's no damage. My car is fine. I

498
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,100
Go look at his car. His truck is fine

499
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:43,080
I was like dude, you are so lucky your car's filthy and he's like what I was like put your registration back in your car

500
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,280
I don't need it. You didn't hurt my car your car. So greasy my car slid right off it

501
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:52,280
And I showed him and he's like, whoa, your car doesn't look like it's damaged at all.

502
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
I was like, it's not.

503
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,280
I didn't really care if maybe reverse damage had been done.

504
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
He was like, don't worry about it, just go on.

505
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,280
He's like, OK.

506
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,280
But I mean, it was just like, didn't you see me?

507
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
He's like, oh, no, no, I didn't.

508
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
I was like, did you look in your rear view mirror?

509
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:15,280
And he actually went, uh, this is my piece of advice.

510
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,280
Look out for Lancers! If you hit one, you die!

511
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,280
End of story.

512
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,280
Especially if it's my Lancer.

513
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
I don't really have a whole lot of FUs this week.

514
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
I'm really not that angsty about a lot of things.

515
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,280
So I would just say FU to, in general, a lack of sleep.

516
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,280
I could step on your foot for you.

517
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,280
No, thank you. FU, Jamie.

518
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,280
FU right back, Ralph!

519
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,280
I haven't been getting a lot of sleep this week.

520
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
So FU did that.

521
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Oh, I know! I got a good one.

522
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,800
FU did the fact that I am traveling to LA next week for my day job

523
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,240
so I'm flying down there and coming back Friday and then

524
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,320
I drive back down on Monday for E3. We'll have a caravan though.

525
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,640
Which I still don't have my confirmation for either. My emails are being ignored

526
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,920
at this point. Isn't that interesting? I still think you should follow my advice.

527
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:08,560
Maybe I'll have to be reporting from the front door because they won't let me in.

528
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,400
We'll see. However you're in and Matt's in but

529
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,480
me no love for Rob. I see how it is.

530
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,640
We'll give you a taser. Well I'll just have to hack things like my DS

531
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,980
because apparently you can hack your DS like you can make it look like a DS

532
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,480
light.

533
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,360
If that's what you, I mean you can't obviously make the shell of it look like

534
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,400
a DS light but

535
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,280
you can make the screen a lot brighter like a DS light. There is some hacks.

536
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,520
It's a hacked firmware that you can

537
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,840
put out there and get on there and it actually was a story that

538
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:49,400
originally broke over on the forums over at GBADEV.com so it actually came

539
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,920
originally from a Spanish board is where this came from so kind of interesting

540
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,680
and there's pictures that prove it that show that it got brighter so if you're

541
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,040
interested in that check that out I remember when the afterburner came out

542
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:06,960
on the GBA I still have I still have mine a GBA with an afterburner I have

543
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,960
I have the afterburner in my GBA, except I loaned my GBA out to a friend who was game-less, sadly.

544
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
My GBA is pink.

545
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Mine is virginal white.

546
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,960
I actually own a pink video game system.

547
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
That's my one requisite girly thing.

548
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
There you go.

549
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,960
By the way, just a quick follow-up, so if you're writing emails right now, you can cut that out.

550
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,960
I did find the quick follow-up there to the EA Spouse story.

551
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,960
There were indeed, those lawsuits were indeed already settled.

552
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,480
It was actually three class-action lawsuits and it was already or they actually weren't settled they

553
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,920
Know they won settlements in three class-action lawsuits the developers did so there it is

554
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,240
All right

555
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,400
Dark Sakura is not going to be reading any mail

556
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,920
But she does have a few words of advice for those you guys that want to send in mail for next week's show

557
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:06,080
um yeah send more of it you know I understand I've got three weeks worth of

558
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,960
email that's come through that I've replied to as many of them as I could

559
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,120
within the limited scope of my homework beating me over the head with a sledge

560
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:20,800
hammer but I'm gonna start fresh if you've got I promise I will read emails

561
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,400
next week yeah and also send me good ones also we get a lot of story

562
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,000
suggestions on like Myspace and the emails and I get them in my box too and

563
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,180
trust me we have our pulse on like almost every blog and site out there we

564
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,720
check a ton of them daily and we even get some press releases of our own once

565
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,720
in a while and you know we get really lucky we might break a story not that we

566
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,000
don't appreciate it please understand but also you know we really want to hear

567
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,240
your opinions and your thoughts on things that's what we're really after

568
00:35:52,240 --> 00:36:00,240
Also, make sure that if you have an email address that in any way remotely resembles anything spam,

569
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:07,240
when you send us an email in the subject line, make sure you put OLR and then your subject.

570
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:15,240
That way, even if it comes into the spam folder, I at least see that we have OLR in the title and I can check it.

571
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,240
Anything that has a spam thing on it, I instantly delete it.

572
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,240
I'm sorry, I check the email for us at various locations.

573
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,280
I do not want to run the risk of infecting systems

574
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,600
that are not my property.

575
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,360
If I infect my own system, I can fix it.

576
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,800
Maybe you should be doing work at work.

577
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,280
I never said I was at work.

578
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,720
I'm just teasing you.

579
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,800
I'm a good girl and I do my job.

580
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,220
All right, guess what?

581
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,520
Koei has revealed their E3 lineup,

582
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:54,840
And in that lineup, Guitaro Man Live is coming to the PSP in America, that's going to be shown at E3.

583
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
I love Koei.

584
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,520
It's exciting news indeed, don't you think?

585
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
I love Koei.

586
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,720
I know, I love him too for that.

587
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,720
Koei is another one of my favorite companies that not many people, you know, think of.

588
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,020
I'm very happy to hear that.

589
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,620
Now if they'll just bring us another KO Flying Squadron, oh yeah, I'll be happy.

590
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,620
Well, I'm trying to remember the other stuff they have coming to E3.

591
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,520
They also announced some other things that are supposed to be coming to E3.

592
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,520
Dynasty Warriors.

593
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
Yeah, they're doing Dynasty Warriors.

594
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,520
Okay.

595
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:27,520
Alright, well then let's go over now to DarkSakura to talk about how she likes to surf the internet.

596
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,520
You know, sometimes when she's at work.

597
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,520
Not at work.

598
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,520
Sometimes when she's at friends' houses.

599
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,520
And she finds great websites to share with you guys in her Website of the Week.

600
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,520
I actually didn't find this one on my own.

601
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,520
This one was given to us in the middle of my Flash class.

602
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:51,520
And I figured Flash pisses me off so much. I'm sure we have many other listeners who are just as pissed off by Flash as I am.

603
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,520
It does not, by the way, piss me off as much as Illustrator does.

604
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,520
So, this site is called actionscript.org.

605
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:05,520
For anyone who has to deal with a lot of in-depth Flash stuff, by now you are familiar with how frustrating working with scripts can be.

606
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:13,520
Programming in your stop here, play, and then stop on frame, kiss my butt, so this is the perfect site.

607
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,180
perfect site it has not only does it have tutorials on how to set up a lot of

608
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:21,440
your different flash actions also outlined from beginning to advanced

609
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,760
level it has your actual scripts that you need to make all this stuff work and

610
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,320
working examples some of these are also listed with movie files to go along with

611
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,200
them to show you how to do it cool very cool site not only that it's also

612
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:42,720
available in I believe Japanese Dutch French Russian and Serbian for anybody

613
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,220
that needs those Serbians. Sometimes you need to read your sights in Serbians. Who knows,

614
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:52,660
it could be from that area of the world. That's right. You provide a world-class service to

615
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:59,660
our listeners. Of course I do. Moving on, we've got one last story for you guys tonight,

616
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,900
unless you have any last minute stories. I don't have anything. Do you have any last

617
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,940
minute stories? Nothing video game related, but this is just nerd happy. Ok, what? I found

618
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:12,660
out that the movie theater at Arden Fair Mall is playing Spaceballs next week.

619
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:17,180
They do cult movies every Thursday. They're playing Spaceballs. We need

620
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,220
Spaceballs the game. I kind of want to go to that except I'm gonna be out of town

621
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:25,020
which makes me sad. I'm going to I'm going to Fandango my tickets. I will

622
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:29,460
dance the Fandango with my credit card. Well we've got one last story for you

623
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,780
guys tonight and it's it's huge I mean this is huge news absolutely big huge

624
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,940
news that just shook the game industry like crazy this week and I mean because

625
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,480
who doesn't love Indiana Jones? I love Indiana Jones. And Indiana Jones is

626
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,680
another one of those movies that was... I know they're actually doing Temple of

627
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,160
Doom. All right well here it is I mean just had people talking this week Lucas

628
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:59,140
Arts is supposedly going to be showing an Indiana Jones game at E3 2006 and all

629
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,000
that's that's about all we know we know Lucas Arts is doing it and they're

630
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,560
They're supposedly showing it at E3, but there's not a lot.

631
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:11,160
Now, this would make sense because they're supposedly in Indiana Jones movie, new one

632
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,520
coming on the way too.

633
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,440
Harrison Ford is too old for this stuff.

634
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,560
Yes, but Sean Connery is rumored to be reprising his role, which might be cool.

635
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
I love Sean Connery!

636
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,960
I know, who doesn't love Sean Connery?

637
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,400
He could be a quadruple amputee and he would still be hot.

638
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Alright.

639
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,440
Well, I think that's about all the stories this week.

640
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,920
Yeah, I can't think of anything else.

641
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,080
I can't really think of anything else either, so I guess that's it. We're done with the show so

642
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,560
Thanks for tuning in and tuning in to our special show this week really appreciate it

643
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,720
And now it's time to go around and get our final thoughts dark soccer your final thought I

644
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,840
want chocolate

645
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:52,520
And my final thought is I want pizza. Let's get pizza. I think that's a good idea have chocolate after oh great idea

646
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,520
How about chocolate-covered pizza?

647
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,660
Maybe not all right well

648
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,100
Well I guess that's going to do it for another week of Orange on the Radio.

649
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,860
Thank you so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent radio even on weeks

650
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,700
when we're not fully staffed.

651
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,700
Really appreciate it.

652
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,700
We love you guys!

653
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,940
Don't forget to check out our big preview show next week for E3 and don't forget to

654
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,740
come by the E3 Outpost and check that out as well.

655
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,340
Remember, chocolate and a dollar.

656
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,340
Oh!

657
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:25,580
By the way, I forgot, Nintendo renamed their revolution to the Wii.

658
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,580
See you next week!

659
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,580
Weeeeeeeeee!

660
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,580
Weeeeeeeeeeeee!

661
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,580
Okay, look.

662
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,580
We thought it might be a little fun because

663
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,580
we know that all the other game podcasts that you

664
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,580
listen to are probably gonna talk and talk

665
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,580
and talk and talk about the Wii thing this week.

666
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,580
So we thought it might be fun to

667
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,580
you know, avoid the pink elephant in the room

668
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
for a little while, but

669
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,580
how can we forget that Nintendo

670
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,580
has renamed the revolution to

671
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,580
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

672
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,580
I don't need to say much more

673
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,740
more about it okay you read about it on every freaking gaming site out there

674
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,740
you've heard about it

675
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,180
all your friends are probably been bitching about it I know seriously with

676
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:37,180
the internet is bitching about you want to know what what I don't care what they

677
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,220
name it as long as I get my Zelda crack

678
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:43,220
exactly can in fact can I read a passage from my life journal that would explain

679
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,660
exactly how I feel I really should have posted this avoid the email part

680
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,980
I should have been remember the live journalist for email all of live

681
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,800
Journal is emo. And MySpace is where the internet goes to die. Oh, but we have a MySpace, so

682
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,520
don't forget to add us over there. Yeah, but we don't die there, we just sort of work like

683
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,160
zombies. Alright, look, I'm gonna read a little passage from my Live Journal that I think

684
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,420
explains exactly how I feel about this whole thing. Remember that's WII we, and I didn't

685
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:14,420
cross post this to the Stuff Blog because I'm lazy. Here it is. Dear gaming community,

686
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:19,280
they could have called it the Nintendo Poopmonger, and as long as there's a sexy Zelda game on

687
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,320
it or an innovative Mario title or some kwaii animal crossing game or hopefully a new innovative

688
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,520
franchise, y'all will be anxious to play it.

689
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,360
Remember Nintendo is not after your business so much this time and while yes I agree they

690
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:38,400
need it to be successful, remember the fact stated above that you'll play a good game

691
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,200
regardless of the name of the system it's on.

692
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,960
This whole Wii thing is highly symbolic of the push Nintendo is trying to make to break

693
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,360
the gamer stereotypes and get this thing playable by anyone.

694
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,180
It's a weird name but honestly you had to expect something like this from

695
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,080
Nintendo.

696
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,120
Let's wait and see how good the games are. P.S.

697
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,800
while you yes you can say we is stupid because come play with my we we haha

698
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,560
it's just as easy to make fun of a sex box or a gay stations.

699
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,880
Potty brains can ruin anything trust me I know.

700
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,720
You know what when I first saw it though and if there hadn't been a pronunciation

701
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,320
guide with it I was thinking

702
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:20,880
Well, maybe they... Why? I was thinking why, because that actually would make sense in my head.

703
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,880
Because why is like yay in Japanese.

704
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,520
W-A-I. I thought that if they were going to spell it, it would be why.

705
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,200
But we... I'd be like, it's cute! It's why!

706
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,720
You know, I get what they're doing. I don't hate the name so much.

707
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,320
We had the Pico, remember? But that was for kids. It's weird, yeah, but Nintendo isn't...

708
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:48,320
Nintendo's trying to reach a broad audience. They want that buzzword, that easy word this time,

709
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,320
because they're not trying to reach just gamers. They want everybody.

710
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,320
They want Oprah to come out and talk about her Wii.

711
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,320
Wii! I've been calling it the Nintendo Wii!

712
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,320
And all those potty jokes and things, Nintendo I think hopes to transcend that.

713
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:07,320
If they can get the name Wii out there, then I'm going to go home and play with my Wii

714
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,320
is not going to have the same connotation that it does today.

715
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,680
Nintendo can get over that, then they've been truly successful. If they can't, they're doomed.

716
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,880
We've actually been having a bit of discussion about this on one of the moderator boards

717
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:24,600
I'm on, about how... it's just been back and forth, like, we've all decided, though, that

718
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,280
they had to have been on heroin when they came up with the name.

719
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,460
I don't think so. It seems like something to me, and I'm speculating here, it seems

720
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:37,820
like something that kind of Nintendo Japan probably came up with, and once they kind

721
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,560
of gave their reasons, America was like, okay, we can do that.

722
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,660
And I realized, everybody's like, why didn't you just keep the revolution?

723
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,520
Why didn't you just keep the revolution?

724
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,380
Do you know how difficult that might be to pronounce for some people outside the US?

725
00:45:53,380 --> 00:46:00,200
You might as well call it the Nintendo prel, some of you guys will get that joke, but I

726
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,180
think they wanted something very simplistic.

727
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:07,300
That's the whole thing they're going for, and revolution also has a negative context

728
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,860
in some places, take the game Dance Dance Revolution, they don't call it that in Europe

729
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,440
because of the term Revolution, I don't know, somebody gets offended by it.

730
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,220
They call it Dancing Stage, which is a completely different name.

731
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,500
So I think Revolution wouldn't have worked worldwide.

732
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,940
And I don't think there's been a console that's changed their name from country to country

733
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,940
in a while.

734
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:32,340
I mean, yes, we had Famicom, NES, Mega Drive, Genesis, but in the past few years, ever since

735
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,140
the PlayStation era, it hasn't really been called different names in different countries.

736
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:41,500
always been the same. So I just think Revolution, while it might be appropriate of what Nintendo's

737
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,380
going after, I don't think it was an appropriate name for a console. I don't think it would have

738
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:50,780
worked. So we all knew something different was coming. I think Wii was just a little bit surprising

739
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:57,100
to some people. But let Nintendo put their money where their mouth is, let's see some of the games,

740
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:01,740
and that's really what it's all about, right? Who cares what the system is called? It doesn't matter.

741
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,700
remember we had the Pico we had a system named after food I mean if you're

742
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:11,100
seriously not gonna buy this because you don't want a Wii in your house I don't

743
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,180
mind having a Wii in my house then Nintendo would that make the following

744
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,900
suggestions to you and it based on a recent rebuttal argument that was made

745
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,740
on some websites out there don't fly Virgin Atlantic don't drink naked juice

746
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:29,580
don't go to Yahoo or Google because those are all silly names too so I think

747
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:36,920
In the world of advertising, being that that's part of what I am in school, you have to do

748
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:43,740
something that's going to be easily memorable, something that people are going to talk about

749
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,700
and is immediately catching.

750
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,100
Well, we've got all three of that already.

751
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,280
How can you forget we?

752
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,100
And then everybody is talking about it because it's like, oh my god, weee!

753
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,100
Seriously?

754
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,140
And then, on top of that, it's easy.

755
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,100
there it's we so Nintendo did a very

756
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,700
risky ballsy thing with this and I'm not

757
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,980
trying to say that oh I'm not I may be a

758
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,620
little bit of a Nintendo fanboy but I'm

759
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,180
just a gaming fanboy I like all the

760
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,700
systems and you know I think Nintendo's

761
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,540
just taking a big risk with this I think

762
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,300
it's a it's an interesting choice but

763
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,220
it's a risky choice and they're taking a

764
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,540
big risk with this but nobody said that

765
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,420
this next-gen console war is gonna be an

766
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,180
easy fight right they can change their

767
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,540
mine too. I don't think they will. I know the internet is convinced there's been

768
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,300
stories that

769
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:35,620
well the Wii's not trademarked so it's not the real name and all this other

770
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,820
conspiracy theories. Guys, I don't really see that happening.

771
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,980
It's the name of the console so enjoy it. Although I do have to say that I think

772
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,280
Sony has really had the best idea overall

773
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,980
with keeping a single name and just adding a number.

774
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,500
But you know what?

775
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,820
If I'm in Nintendo shoes I can say that...

776
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,920
it's the same thing, it's the same old thing, it's just another fricking game

777
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,160
thing, it's another game system.

778
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,560
Nintendo doesn't want that this time. Nintendo wants something

779
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,780
bigger than your typical game system.

780
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,700
But, in the end? It's a game system. True.

781
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:15,580
You're not gonna escape the fact that they are still marketing games.

782
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,300
They're not trying to market to non-gamers, they're

783
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,380
trying to make non-gamers

784
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:24,860
into gamers. And so they're trying to convert the masses.

785
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:28,500
Just remember as you post to message forums you're

786
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,720
angst about how much you hate the name Wii. Please remember

787
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,660
the golden rule of gaming. It's not the system, it's the games that are on it.

788
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,060
Right, the system is only as good as the games that are on it. So
