Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Alright, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. This is April 23rd, 2006, our show for tonight, episode number 182.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,260
Kid Whatever from In the Groove is gonna be here in just a little bit

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,060
but first we got some more news to get to and Loki's gonna start us off with

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,220
Nintendo Revolution

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,740
yes go revolution anyways

9
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,460
um one of the games that's some

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,860
form of its coming to the revolution at least that's the room we're recording the

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,060
Famitsu magazine

12
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,620
would be Knights yes Sega's Knights is gonna be making an appearance on the

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,300
revolution

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,620
It'd definitely be interesting to play that with the Revolution controller.

15
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,020
Don't know if it's going to be a new game.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,060
Don't know if it's going to be a port.

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,500
Do know it's going to be coming.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Squee.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,020
A lot of fans very excited about that.

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,500
I think they should make a new game.

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,300
I think it'd be cool because it's flying around stuff and that'd really work with the remote.

22
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,620
Or controller.

23
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,540
We want to keep calling it a remote because it looks like a remote but it's a damn controller.

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,540
Alright.

25
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:28,260
Also, a very popular series coming back, officially announced this week on the Xbox 360, Phantasy

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,180
Star Universe is going to be coming out.

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,580
We all knew it was coming, but SEGA has now officially announced it.

28
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,420
There's going to be an epic story, a single player adventure, there's going to be of course

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,320
the online mode as well, real-time battles where players choose their own strategies.

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,700
Kind of different than most MMOs, Phantasy Star is like an action-based MMO, a little

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,100
more so, especially than any other.

32
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:58,380
entirely quite MMO, it's more like a Guild Wars type MMO, instanced dungeons all the

33
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,380
whole way around.

34
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,020
It's basically Diablo 2 in 3D, but don't tell a Phantasy Star fan that, because they might

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,020
resent that.

36
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,820
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

37
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,820
Yeah, Diablo 2 is a great game, but that's really what I felt when I first played Phantasy

38
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,780
Star Online, I was like, this is Diablo 2 in space 3D.

39
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,620
Like seriously, that's what it felt like to me, I don't know, maybe I'm just weird.

40
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,620
Let's see, what's the release date for this?

41
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,580
I'm trying to see it was somewhere on here on the system do or do we?

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,700
Maybe it's not on here, and we just announced it a couple weeks ago right since September in it

43
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,660
We announced it a few weeks ago, and I don't have it in front of me

44
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,600
Otherwise I would tell you that's right. Let me see let me see but let me do a fine for the word September

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,440
No, it's not showing up so so much of that so no official release date yet. Although. It's September

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,280
Wait hold on there's gonna be a score done by premier orchestras and vocals from Poland, Hollywood, New York

47
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,160
New York online gameplay six player squads this time in multi-player so that should be

48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,340
fun and 40 hours of offline gameplay they're saying endless and endless hours online and

49
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,720
hopefully expandable quests and all that good stuff so you're wrong oh what what did I do

50
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,100
October 25th oh my bad octo oh and let me do let me do a search it's for october nope

51
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,700
that didn't come up either so they didn't they didn't announce the official release

52
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,640
date but that's on playstation 2 that's the only thing that they had announced on uh currently

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,480
But I'd imagine it's coming out at the same time.

54
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,840
But it's coming out on Xbox 360 which is a little bit of a

55
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,300
oh hey cool you know it's coming out there too.

56
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,960
So a lot of folks would be picking it out there. Hopefully not as tricky to get

57
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,940
signed up and play as it is with Final Fantasy XI.

58
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,400
I remember I remember Phantasy Star was kind of

59
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,880
easy on the original Xbox to sign up and play so I don't see why the

60
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,000
Phantasy Star universe wouldn't be any different.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,280
Alright, moving on, I also have a story here.

62
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,400
This ran on Kotaku, apparently there is a lot of buzz around the internet this week

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,700
about a new Kid Icarus game that's supposed to be happening, because there's this artwork

64
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,360
circulating around on the internet, and they're going OMG, finally, Kid Icarus on the revolution,

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,180
is it finally going to happen, and I guess it was actually published on a Korean game

66
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,780
site that said that this was supposed to be happening, well guess what guys, it actually

67
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,140
We LIE to you!

68
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,420
Somebody got it from a DeviantArt website.

69
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,580
Some guy made this on DeviantArt, and Kotaku actually links the dude's DeviantArt page,

70
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,340
and there it is. There's the concept art for Kid Icarus Revolution.

71
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,060
So it's not this guy's fault, it's the Korean website's fault that sort of perpetuated the rumor.

72
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,300
There are some fools right now who just need to be smacked straight off the face of the internet.

73
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,020
You know what though? Come on, can you blame them? Kid Icarus...

74
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:47,020
It's a beloved Nintendo franchise for the past, what, 20 years now that still has never really seen anything next-gen.

75
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,020
Didn't they have something on Game Boy or something?

76
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,020
They had a Game Boy release.

77
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,020
That's a minor release, too. It wasn't even a major deal.

78
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,020
So, we're just left hanging here, guys.

79
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,020
Why is it? I don't understand why Nintendo does not want to touch this franchise again.

80
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,020
It doesn't make sense to me.

81
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:12,020
Maybe they think they can't do it justice. I mean, they have... wait, what about this

82
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,020
flight game that they're doing with Hudson? You think they might have a cameo?

83
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,020
No. It's a little far-fetched, but... It is.

84
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,020
Nah, they're way too far-fetched. Way too far-fetched, okay.

85
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,020
When they're talking about bombing runs and stuff, I don't think you're going to have

86
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,020
Kid Icarus doing bombing runs. No, thanks.

87
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,020
I don't know, the Bow and Arrow had a lot of range when you upgraded it a lot.

88
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,020
Alright, I posted the link there to the DVR&ART page because some folks in chat were asking

89
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,020
for it.

90
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,660
So if you want to join our chat room, if you're listening live on Sunday night, www.orangelaundry.com,

91
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,660
click on chat.

92
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,060
But our chat room is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, you can just pop in there anytime.

93
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,060
And there's some lurkers.

94
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,220
Magus, you lurk in there a little bit, don't you?

95
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,220
You should...

96
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,220
All the time.

97
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,220
Alright, so you can be our...

98
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,220
In fact, I'm in there right now.

99
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,460
You are, even though you're here.

100
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,500
I'm just watching myself do nothing.

101
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
That's alright.

102
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,380
You're logging what people say about you in chat.

103
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,320
on what a horrible job you're doing tonight. No, I'm teasing, you're doing great.

104
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,840
And you've told no really bad jokes tonight, which I appreciate,

105
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,840
might I say. Give it time, give it time. We still have half the show to do.

106
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,120
Alright, Loki! Some Xbox Live news.

107
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,440
Yes, lots of fun stuff. But

108
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,840
first off, demos. Tiger Woods finally getting the demo on

109
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,400
Xbox Live, as well as Amp 3, the game we gave away last week.

110
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,200
and so definitely check those out if you haven't yet

111
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,120
of course the speed packs up there for Project Gotham Racing 3 as well as the

112
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,840
more co-op stuff and new

113
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,440
cameo downloads as well and

114
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,920
lots of stuff going to be coming especially E3 week

115
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,920
talking about a demo for FIFA World Cup Soccer 06 and

116
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,000
more stuff like that. MotoGP 06 is supposed to be coming too

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,080
which looked really cool. Alright excellent so check your eye

118
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,520
Keep your eyes out on Xbox Live for that and plenty more demos. We're hoping a lot

119
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,760
of good stuff during E3.

120
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,640
It's just me though, or does the marketplace need a facelift pretty bad?

121
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,720
It's starting to get a little... it's just too much there. They need a more like a...

122
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,240
a more user... it's not a user-friendly system to me.

123
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,440
I don't know. But I guess they designed it so it could be upgradable later on, right?

124
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,960
I would imagine so. I think it's just a dashboard upgrade.

125
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,800
Some other things that they're talking about coming to live soon

126
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,060
is custom gamer pics

127
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,100
that you'll be able to make yourself. About time.

128
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,140
Well isn't that going to kill the market for the

129
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,020
ones that they sell? Because wouldn't it be so easy? Yeah, that would I would think.

130
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,380
But maybe you have to pay to put it up or something.

131
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,740
Aha! There's the trick. Okay, that's probably what it is.

132
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,940
You might have the same problem you had with DS and PictoChat.

133
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,340
Random people making obscene images.

134
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,140
possible oh yeah I don't have to filter that that's true

135
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,800
because you just put a big big pair titties right there is your gamer

136
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,460
picture and there's

137
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,740
yeah and so there's no screen they're probably gonna have to a

138
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,340
filter and approve every single custom avatar people putting offensive things

139
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,180
like you know

140
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,920
just do who knows the postage stamps a while back remember that people were

141
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,300
put in like Hitler and things on postage stamps and there's big no no

142
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,860
so I think they may be opening up a huge can of worms are not prepared for

143
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,220
Oh yeah, and I think the Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter demo is on there too.

144
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,100
I think it came out a few weeks ago though.

145
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,300
I think there's an offline one now that's available. I think there was an online one, now there's an offline one.

146
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,340
I think. Don't quote me on that. Just going off whatever. I don't...

147
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,220
I have to admit, I don't follow a whole lot of the news of that series, but...

148
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,740
I kinda just go online and try to be surprised when I see stuff.

149
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,940
Yep, GK128 in chat agrees with me. The new demo's one player.

150
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,020
As opposed to a multiplayer. I don't like those multiplayer demos. I think it's kinda cool, but you should have a demo that you get to pick

151
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,180
whether it's multiplayer or not. It's just my thought.

152
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,820
Alright, well it's been a little while since we've had an interview on the show, right Logie?

153
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,760
A little bit, yeah. Alright, and we haven't really talked enough about music games

154
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,620
tonight, so we should bring on somebody to talk about music games tonight, right Logie?

155
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,100
Hell yeah. Alright, well we have another special guest on tonight's program and

156
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,840
that person is Kid Whatever.

157
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,720
Music game fans recognize the name Kid Whatever from his contributions to the

158
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,660
In the Groove series of games. If you watch the Anime Convention Circuit,

159
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,980
You may have also heard the buzz around his live appearance at SakuraCon last month.

160
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,100
He has a new CD out called Hi, I'm Sorry I'm Late, I Brought Some Records, and he's here

161
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,220
with us tonight to talk about his recent accomplishments.

162
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Kid, whatever.

163
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,220
Are you there?

164
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,220
I'm here.

165
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,220
How's it going?

166
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,220
Hey, pretty good.

167
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,220
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

168
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,220
How are you doing?

169
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,220
I'm tired.

170
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,220
Tired?

171
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,220
What have you been up to?

172
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,680
I'm exhausted.

173
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,260
Nonstop stuff pretty much for the last month or so ever since getting ready for SakuraCon

174
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:57,220
and playing up there, and then came home, got my album released, and then we shot a

175
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,620
music video last week, which we just finished.

176
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,340
So it's just been non-stop work, work, work.

177
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
Awesome.

178
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,540
Can we check out that music video on your website, kidwhatever.com?

179
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,540
You can.

180
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,540
Yep.

181
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,540
Awesome.

182
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,300
Well, first, I've got to go back to the past and kind of set the stage here for those that

183
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,260
may not recognize your name.

184
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,860
You're involved with the dance game In the Groove, right?

185
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
That is correct.

186
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,660
How did you get hooked up with the In the Groove project?

187
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,260
Kyle Ward, the main music producer, who I'm sure you guys are familiar with, he and I

188
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:33,980
go way, way, way back to just being 19, 20 year old DDR brats, and when he got hooked

189
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,660
up in the game, he just asked me if I wanted to take a shot at making a song for it, and

190
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,460
I made While the Record Spins, and they put that on the test machine up in Seattle, and

191
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,980
Everybody loved it, so we just kept going, we just ran with it.

192
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,740
While the record spins isn't really credited to Kid Whatever, though, do you use multiple

193
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,740
music games?

194
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,540
Yeah, I have used a few different names for the game.

195
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,780
If I want to explore a different kind of sound, I'll just throw a different alias on there.

196
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,180
We notice that happens a lot in music games, is that artists tend to use multiple names.

197
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,060
I know Kyle does it, too.

198
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,820
Is that just the reason a certain genre will get a certain name in the game?

199
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
It's purposefully to confuse you.

200
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,620
Well, it worked.

201
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,620
Congratulations.

202
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,620
Thank you.

203
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,960
Now, you said in there that you and Kyle met through DDR, so you guys were a fan of music

204
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,180
games before In the Groove?

205
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,180
Oh, yeah.

206
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,180
Way back.

207
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,180
Yep.

208
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
So, what do you think about all that?

209
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,900
I know this is a touchy subject, but I'm kind of curious what you think about all that controversy

210
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,900
going back and forth.

211
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,980
Does it just stay far away from it?

212
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,580
As far as what the...

213
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,940
Like you know the whole DDR in the groove, you know it kind of polarizes the fan base

214
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,020
and all that stuff, the lawsuit and all that stuff.

215
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,740
I don't really know any details about the lawsuits, I can't really talk about that,

216
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,620
but you know there's room for both games, honestly.

217
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:04,740
I love them both, they both are good in different ways, so I don't really see the point of,

218
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,380
you know, DDR vs. in the groove.

219
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,380
I think there's room for both games. Love them both. Embrace them.

220
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,860
There you go. Well, obviously people in the community feel the same because In the

221
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,260
Groove 3 was announced not that long ago, right?

222
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,880
You know, I don't know. I'm pretty sure they had announced it at some

223
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,700
arcade thing that they're gonna do In the Groove 3, so

224
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,140
some convention that had happened a while. I was gonna ask what your

225
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,340
involvement was with In the Groove 3. I'm assuming there's gonna be something

226
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,020
coming,

227
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:41,100
There are a couple of things that I�ve done. I want to do some more, but we haven�t really

228
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,780
had much time to talk about that. Kyle and I have both been very busy with a lot of other

229
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:50,380
things, so hopefully pretty soon we�ll get a chance to meet up and talk about that stuff.

230
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,340
Everything is still in the very early stages then?

231
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,900
I don�t know as far as my contribution, yeah.

232
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,260
Outside of the In the Groove series, you played Sakura-Con recently and there was 2,000 people

233
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,260
there.

234
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,260
How did you get involved with that?

235
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,180
Brian mentioned that Sakura-Con was going on and they were going to have a dance and

236
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,940
I just decided I wanted to DJ at it and it was just pestering everybody I knew until

237
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,100
I finally got to go up there and meet with them and they said yeah and they let me do

238
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
it.

239
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,100
It was awesome.

240
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
It was so great.

241
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,980
I've never played for that big of a crowd.

242
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,860
When I do shows here in Portland at home, there's maybe 50, maybe 100 people.

243
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,900
That was just incredible to see 2,000 people dancing to my stuff.

244
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,900
It was great.

245
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,620
Do you plan on doing more of these anime shows in the future?

246
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,740
Is this going to be a thing for you traveling the convention circuit?

247
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,380
I don't know yet.

248
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,380
I'd like to.

249
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,740
This one, being here in the Northwest, I was able to make connections pretty easily.

250
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,300
Outside of that, I don't really know anybody.

251
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:02,300
So, I don't know, if you're out there, send me an email. Let's talk about it. I'd love to play more of them.

252
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,300
Alright, awesome. Well, let's give them a sample right now of whatever it sounds like.

253
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,300
We're going to play a track. This song was included in In The Groove 1, which is available right now for PlayStation 2,

254
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,300
as well as still some arcades out there that haven't upgraded to In The Groove 2 yet,

255
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:21,300
but I believe this song carried over into In The Groove 2, and then now this is out on PC as well, right? In The Groove?

256
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,300
Or coming out, or just came out?

257
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
I'm not sure. I think it came out.

258
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,300
I think it just recently came out. Well, here it is, one of the tracks from the games.

259
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,740
I think I like that sound by kid whatever here on orange lounge radio

260
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I think I like how that sounds

261
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:46,460
All right, that was I Think I Like That Sound by Kid Whatever here on Orange Lounge Radio.

262
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,340
If you like that out, check out his website, www.kidwhatever.com.

263
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,580
And we're actually joined by Kid Whatever right now on the program.

264
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:01,060
And you've done a lot of promotion through the internet, through websites, and Myspace,

265
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,060
right?

266
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,060
Yeah.

267
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,060
Right on.

268
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,060
I do.

269
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,820
You have a new CD out called Hi, I'm Sorry I'm Late, I Brought Some Records.

270
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,220
First I have to know where the title came from, that's a very unique title.

271
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:20,340
The title came from, I feel like I should have had an album out a long time ago, and

272
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,000
There's been a couple of plans in the works to put out, like, in-the-groove soundtrack

273
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,320
CDs or CDs with my songs that are in the game, and all of those have fallen through repeatedly.

274
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,840
So I finally decided, you know what, I'm just going to do it myself.

275
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:43,320
So it's an apology, and I hope everybody will forgive me for not having something out

276
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,160
sooner and we can rock out together.

277
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,520
Now, I was going to ask, do you think that the success of your songs in the In the Groove

278
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,180
game is what enabled you to put together this CD?

279
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:01,080
I think I probably would have done it anyway, even if it wasn't for the video game.

280
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,120
What types of ways have you been marketing this CD out there?

281
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,840
Mostly just word of mouth.

282
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,440
That's really all I can do at this point.

283
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,680
It's hard.

284
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,320
It's really difficult when there are so many people who are making electronic music and

285
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,600
putting it on the internet that people just kind of have stopped paying attention.

286
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,720
So just word of mouth, message boards, email lists, just telling everybody that I possibly

287
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,320
can, hey, come check on my stuff, and we just made a music video, so hopefully that will

288
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
help a little bit too.

289
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
What's the music video for?

290
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,480
It's for the song Disco Express.

291
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,360
And how did you come up with the concept for the music video, what did you guys do for

292
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
it?

293
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,440
I had me and about four friends over here and we just decided to basically make jackasses

294
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,760
out of ourselves.

295
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,480
That's the way to do it, fun.

296
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,520
Did you guys come up with an idea before going to shoot the video, or were you just like

297
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,240
eh we'll just get a camera and see what happens?

298
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,400
There was definitely an idea and it all kind of came together at the last minute.

299
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:08,400
I think we spent five days on it total from concept to final edit, so yeah, you should

300
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
check it out.

301
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
It's on my website, kidwhatever.com.

302
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Awesome.

303
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,040
Well, we are all for supporting independent music, especially those artists that hook

304
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,040
themselves up with video games and connect to the gamer culture, which leads me to this

305
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,200
question we always ask here on Orange Launch Radio at the top of our shows, how is your

306
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
gaming week?

307
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,280
So I've got to know, what kind of games have you been playing, video games?

308
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,900
It doesn't have to be music games, just kind of what have you been playing?

309
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:35,100
much non-stop Tetris BS.

310
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,140
It's the first time since I was like 9 or 10 that Tetris has taken over my life.

311
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,580
So I've been hanging out on the internet a little bit, hanging out down at Backspace,

312
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,140
a little internet cafe here in Portland and kicking everybody's ass.

313
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,140
Are you willing to give out your friend code over on KidWhatever.com?

314
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,140
Oh yeah, I should totally put that up.

315
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,140
All right, right on.

316
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,140
Check that out.

317
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,140
Anything else, any other projects or live shows coming up soon that you want to plug?

318
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,140
Nothing yet.

319
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,140
Just try to plan a couple of things.

320
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,140
Probably going to have a CD launch party here next month in Portland, but it's still too

321
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,140
early to say.

322
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,140
I definitely want to DJ and want to book some more gigs, so just keep watching on my website

323
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,080
and all announced stuff as soon as I got it all sorted out.

324
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,960
Alright, awesome. So keep an eye on Kid Whatever over at www.kidwhatever.com.

325
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,080
Hey, thanks so much for being on the program tonight. We really appreciate it.

326
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,800
No problem. Thanks for having me on, Rob. Alright, best of luck to you with your CD.

327
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,560
Thanks. That was awesome. You know, I'm glad that you could come on. Anyways, the next story we have is

328
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,400
coming from...

329
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,360
I was actually talking about the Major League Gaming finally coming to

330
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,960
the USA Network,

331
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,240
Which is interesting because I've never heard of Major League Gaming, but it should be cool.

332
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:59,420
Anyways, Wall Street Journal was reporting that they basically have signed a deal to do a series of seven hour-long shows that are going to be airing on Saturday morning starting this fall.

333
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:08,300
Featuring competitions between gamers ranging from everything from like really serious games from Halo 2 and Super Smash Brothers.

334
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,300
That should be interesting, because I remember they tried something like this with

335
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,520
Arena on G4, and

336
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,540
I don't know, it was an okay show, but I don't know.

337
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,220
Well, you see, the problem with that show is that it was on G4.

338
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,140
Have you watched G4 lately?

339
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,340
You know, actually, no. It was old-school G4, and

340
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,180
you know, it was okay. It was actually one of the, you know, better

341
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,280
shows on the network, probably, but

342
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:40,640
you know just I did like most things on G4 it kinda went downhill as time went on

343
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,920
I said today I actually you know flipped

344
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,360
to G4 to see if there's anything on I flipped ahead

345
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,840
seven hours in advance I would have had to wait seven hours before I actually

346
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,280
saw any programming that had anything to do with games

347
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,400
that's how bad it was. What was it Star Trek 2.0 all day?

348
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,040
Star Trek Next Generation, Fastlane

349
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,600
Brainiac, Bonsai

350
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,380
you know they should do during E3 forget protesting outside the

351
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,720
Convention Center people should be protesting outside G4's booth

352
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,720
bring back gaming television that's what people should be doing

353
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,960
and I guess following the same patterns MTV

354
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,400
you know if G4's booth, yeah but at least MTV stuff they kinda have

355
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,780
you know some music related stuff it's sort of music related like they'll have

356
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,220
music

357
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,960
artists doing shows and stuff like that. This has nothing to do with anything.

358
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,640
This is Star Trek. I have a word of advice kiddies.

359
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,160
If G4's booth is in the same place it was at last year,

360
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,680
you don't have to have a badge to get there because it's in the lobby

361
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,760
and it's even before the place where you pick up your badge holders.

362
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,440
So you could go and if you wanted to, I don't know, protest, hold up a few signs

363
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,040
where the cameras are, let them know what you think, what's going on. You could be there.

364
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,080
Ravel ravel ravel exactly if you want to cause some rabble just just saying not that I'm encouraging it

365
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,780
I'm just saying if you wanted to exercise your your free speech and protest right and gathering right you could do it

366
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,880
Just saying you'll probably get kicked out of the convention center eventually

367
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,160
But you know a big crowd would get noticed by somebody and basically they were right by the door

368
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,400
I mean they were footsteps from the door, so

369
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,900
Well, it's the risk they take that's right

370
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Just saying just saying

371
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,640
Anyway, moving on to another story here.

372
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:37,440
The official Nintendo Magazine might be hinting a little bit at when they're going to be actually

373
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,320
putting out the Nintendo Revolution.

374
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,760
On an upcoming issue, the official Nintendo Magazine divulges info on Sega's upcoming

375
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,740
revolution games.

376
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,820
The article also promises a look at Activision's big project, which I assume is probably the

377
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,380
Tony Hawk game and Ubisoft's ground-making revolution title. Another

378
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,020
page seems to hint at the finalized date of the release for the revolution 27th

379
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,260
of October this of course would line up with the whole we're gonna launch before

380
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,620
Thanksgiving comment although that should be more of a duh because of

381
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,100
course your consoles gonna launch before Thanksgiving if you wanted to be

382
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,620
successful so 27th of October sound reasonable sound a little early what do

383
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,580
you think? Sounds about right. We'll see time will tell otherwise this is just

384
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:29,100
kind of another big question mark. Loki, what else you got? Yes, gotta love when people

385
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:38,260
cause violence over video games. Actually, in Nagasaki, they basically had two teenage

386
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:44,900
brothers fighting over a video game console. One of them ended up dead. To enter, one leaves

387
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,920
with the console. Nah. But anyway, seriously enough. Close to midnight, I have apparently

388
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,000
two siblings, one 13 year old and one 15 year old, fought at home about putting away the

389
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,020
video game console. A young brother was punched and kicked repeatedly until he was unconscious

390
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,520
and died later in the hospital.

391
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:12,080
First World of Warcraft and now video game consoles. When will the tragedy end? Where

392
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,700
was their parents? I'm just waiting for the revolution to come out when you actually will

393
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,660
be able to use the rev-motes to beat them into submission.

394
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,560
There can be only one.

395
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,000
You know, stories about stupid people like that that kill other people over gaming systems

396
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,980
make us really mad, and get us angsty, and that means it's time to bring on the anthem

397
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:40,980
for the FUs of the week.

398
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,500
DarkSakura no esta aqui tonight, so Loki you gotta start us off tonight.

399
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:01,500
I dislike Rockstar and their lack of programming ability in Grand Theft Auto, or at least lazy

400
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,460
lazy programming that's in there. I shouldn't have to find out later, six months later,

401
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,540
while enjoying the really wonderful single player game in Gran Torrato, that the multiplayer

402
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:15,100
does not work correctly. Especially the multiplayer on teams, because you don't want to try it

403
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,180
out. That fucking sucks. And really more attention is to be brought, you know, to this type of

404
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,780
thing, because I mean, we've seen it with San Andreas and how they left in the hot coffee

405
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:29,620
stuff, and now they're just leaving out parts of code for, you know, the multiplayer. Fucking

406
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:34,820
release complete games. Stop patching your games, stop releasing stuff that's not finished

407
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:39,820
and not working. I'm sick and tired of goddamn game publishers out there just dropping the

408
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:46,140
ball on the stuff saying, hey you know what, who cares, we'll fix it later. My FU of the

409
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:51,180
week goes to the cunt that broke into my car sometime over the week and that's the third

410
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,860
time now since I've lived in this apartment complex my car's been broken into. The good

411
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,060
news is that this time the alarm scared him off because the first time I was like, okay

412
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,940
cars get broken into the second time I was like okay I'm getting an alarm on

413
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,540
the fucker seriously this time they broke the window and that was it they

414
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,140
didn't even bother to take the radio or anything because the alarm obviously

415
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,500
scared them off so I hope you learned your lesson you stupid thief why do

416
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,220
people feel the need to steal things from out of my car right in front of my

417
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,780
own damn house that's all it's not like I live in that ghetto of an area it's

418
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,260
actually kind of nice over here it's just the problem is the other side of

419
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,060
their freeway is where the ghetto is so I think they all come over here to break

420
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,660
into our cars and seriously I call the apartment complex to kind of complain

421
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:35,020
like what the hell is security doing and they're just like well it's just part of living in Sacramento

422
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:40,540
it's like okay I've lived in Sacramento bitch my whole life and I've never had

423
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:45,380
my car broken into until I lived here so needless to say orange lounge radio

424
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,540
studio for in October because I'll be moving out of this place thank you very

425
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,980
much that's a good thing they haven't broken in here yet try to steal

426
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,940
something like the equipment can you imagine if the orange lounge radio

427
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,380
Real equipment got stolen, will not be something else.

428
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,780
Andrew, you're F.U. of the week.

429
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,620
Alright, this has been holding out for a long time, well maybe a week, maybe a week that's

430
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,620
a long time.

431
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,980
Okay, F.U. to these just masses of people who are just overreacting.

432
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:20,620
Now if you go to gamefacts.com, you'll notice that C&S kind of changed the logo, changed

433
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,420
the design of the site around to match more with their sister site of GameSpot.

434
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:35,700
Now we have all sorts of people on the forum, and they have a nice little GameSpot logo

435
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:42,980
piggybacking on the GameFAQs logo, and for such a minor cosmetic change, people are freaking

436
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:48,140
out left and right, saying that, uh, basically, this is another reminder that they sold out

437
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,140
to the man.

438
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,940
Well, it was that or half the site go under, but there are just people just freaking out

439
00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:01,700
over this, over what's just a cosmetic change, saying soul a site is gone, and now that the

440
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:08,300
administrators are offering add-on premium services they say oh my god now

441
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:14,780
the entire site is going to pick go pay seriously fucking chill out what is

442
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:21,040
there is gonna be free what is new might be paid okay I have to play devil's

443
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,980
advocate for a minute here just just I'm not I'm Sam personally feel this way

444
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:29,120
here's devil's advocate because this is mostly a user content site is that why

445
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,400
people are maybe a little miffed at this whole thing with the GameSpot logo because like

446
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,960
I wrote that back I don't want GameSpot's name attached only because they can't read

447
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:46,080
all of the user submitted stuff is copyrighted by that user GameSpot CNET has to talk to them

448
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:55,680
and have them sell their FAQ to CNET for them to have it on a premium content system

449
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,540
They gave it, but they still have the copyright over it.

450
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:05,880
Everything that is free will stay free, so people just need to shut the fuck up.

451
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,480
It's just a cosmetic change, it's nothing more than that.

452
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
Seriously.

453
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
Chill.

454
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,720
Alright, you can address those cards in letters, too.

455
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,640
What's your name over on the game pack forum?

456
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
The 23rd Megas.

457
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,200
There you go.

458
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Are you a mod over there?

459
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
What are you trying to...

460
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,480
I applied to be a mod, got rejected, had sort of a user map issue.

461
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,660
Why did they reject you?

462
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:31,460
I had a user map issue. I was sort of logging in from work and my user map was huge.

463
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,860
I didn't think it was exactly secure.

464
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,100
At least that was the reason they gave me it.

465
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,380
Would it help if we wrote a letter endorsing you?

466
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,100
No.

467
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,500
No, that might hurt you because we're a no-name site?

468
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Why would you want to mod Game Facts, to be honest?

469
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,100
I don't know. I've been there for like five years.

470
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,740
They have pretty big message forums and you know you might make friends there.

471
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,220
Yeah, but their message forums is like...

472
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,040
That's almost like MySpace-ish.

473
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,560
okay okay okay there are parts that are pretty god damn dumb but

474
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,360
you can find little nuggets of intelligence there somewhere you know

475
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:00,800
what do

476
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,600
I bet people try to find a game on there that's like really old school

477
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,760
like on an Atari 20

478
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,480
like hey let's all go meet on the Keystone capers forums

479
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,480
people do that I have done that I have a secret board

480
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,300
well it's not so secret anymore but I don't want to say on the air but people

481
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,000
have done that

482
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,600
I think I know what it is because you told me before but I told you I'm not telling

483
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,200
anyone else

484
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,160
I'll be nice.

485
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,640
But seriously, you can find some intelligence on there, obviously

486
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,640
not as often on places like Random Insanity, but occasionally on current events

487
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,500
on some of the secret boards you can

488
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,760
find a lot of good content.

489
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,120
But people are just freaking out over nothing, I think.

490
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,920
Alright, there you have it.

491
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,320
Alright, views of the week, boys and girls.

492
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,480
Take them or leave them.

493
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,200
Moving on!

494
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,960
There's another list. I brought a top ten list, now I've got a top one hundred list

495
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,920
coming from a next generation reports this that's next-gen.biz develop

496
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:04,720
magazine mentioned what the top 100 development studios are and they man

497
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,200
today list them all it starts off with 100 is Hudson 99 magic pockets and all

498
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,680
the way through and let's see it finally we get to the top 10 at some point here

499
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,520
and let me see if I can get to the top 10 real quickly here the top 10 were

500
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:29,320
number 10 Sony London Studios number 9 travelers tales that's the Lego Star

501
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:35,000
Wars folks number 8 EA Redwood Shores number 7 polyphony digital number 6

502
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,440
Ubisoft Montreal number 5 Nintendo number 4 maxis number 3 konami core

503
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,600
number 2 pandemic studios about Star Wars Battlefront 2 all that stuff and

504
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,200
and number one EA Canada was named as the number one development studio

505
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,560
what the criteria were I'm not I'm not quite quite sure here let me see if I

506
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:54,960
can

507
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,960
check that out here on the beginning articles I'm very curious you know how

508
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
did they determine

509
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,680
what they was the 100 here

510
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:08,680
let's see and saying that develop is a definitive

511
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:13,540
success game studios ranked in terms of their UK sales

512
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:19,300
interesting all right I'll check that out if you want to that's from develop

513
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:25,020
magazine lists always sure to cause controversy there comments from our chat

514
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:32,860
room hits ten hits done says no treasure that list fails point taken all right

515
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:39,540
moving on Loki what he got for us another list this time it's a good list

516
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,380
it's a list of the games that Capcom is gonna have playable at e3 goody goody

517
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:49,620
Starting off with Playstation 2, we have Okami, finally, which I think was playable last year

518
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,620
too.

519
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,620
Now I want to say it was shown last year too.

520
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,060
God Hand, which looks pretty cool.

521
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,140
Street Fighter Alpha Anthology, yeah another collection.

522
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:04,580
On the 360, Lost Planet and Dead Rising, hell yeah Dead Rising is going to be awesome.

523
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:10,900
PSP Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins and Monster Hunter Freedom, surprisingly missing would

524
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:17,800
be the Power Zone Collection and the Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded and the Capcom

525
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:26,900
Puzzle Collection. DS, Mega Man ZX, and Game Boy Advance, Mega Man Battle Network 6, Psybeast

526
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:34,320
Gregor, and Psybeast Falzar are the two games that they're going to have for that.

527
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,300
Comments from our chatroom over at orangehonestradio.com. I like this nickname, Control-Alt-F'd. It

528
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,700
says Capcom home to the endless Mega Man game sequels and DJ Pooh Eater follows up

529
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,940
with Mega Man triple X.

530
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,860
That's true.

531
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:54,400
Capcom has done a lot of Mega Man. Where the hell is my Mega Man Legends sequels?

532
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,140
Yeah, seriously. That was a good series. That would be, you know, hey, if you don't want to

533
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,760
continue it on with the, you know,

534
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,660
PS2 or whatever, PSP, just bring it out on the revolution or something. Hell, remake

535
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,640
the first game,

536
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,200
make it bigger. Actually, I've heard rumors that ZX is gonna have a couple ties to the

537
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,120
Legend series.

538
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,280
I'm not sure if those are confirmed or not. No, Mega Man Z

539
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,040
was last year's

540
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,680
DS title. I think it was just another side-scroller game.

541
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,120
Danse Cook in our chat room says, needs more Phoenix Wright.

542
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,880
Yes, actually they are translating the Phoenix Wright

543
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,080
sequels, but for mobile phone.

544
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:41,780
However, it would not be too hard for people who are into, say, ROM hacking, to take the

545
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:49,460
translated scripts for the mobile versions and insert them into the Japanese GBA games.

546
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,460
So we'll have to see how that turns out.

547
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,760
Well, that's a lot of game.

548
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,500
I never got into Phoenix, right?

549
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,500
Well...

550
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
Phoenix, right?

551
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,020
They're just sold out right now, that's all.

552
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,140
They're making more.

553
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:07,860
Did I mention that they were making, what was that, the tentative date for the DDR Mario

554
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,140
mix was in May, May 17th?

555
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,860
What, for the new Mario mix?

556
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,780
Well, it's not new, but it's being brought back out because it's been sold out since

557
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,780
October.

558
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,140
Yeah, I think you said May 17th or something.

559
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,140
Yeah, I don't know.

560
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:25,060
I don't know where the hell you got that from, though.

561
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,220
I think Roz and Chad is pissed because I called her Dan's cook.

562
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,780
Well, look, you changed your nickname.

563
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:35,220
That's what I'm going to credit your comments to, so just be careful.

564
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,180
If you change your nickname to I'm stupid, I'm going to say, hey, I'm stupid in chat,

565
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,180
says this.

566
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:47,100
Alright, something I ought to try.

567
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,340
Unless you change your nickname to something derogatory about myself or Loki or Darksider,

568
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,580
then I just won't read your damn comments at all, dammit.

569
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,540
So got you there.

570
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,180
Moving on, another story here.

571
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,480
Movie, Movie, Movie Madness tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, of course we talked about Silent

572
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,640
Hill in the first half, and Roger Avery played a big part of the Silent Hill script there.

573
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
Guess what?

574
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,520
He's also going to be writing Driver, and not only is he writing it, he's directing

575
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
it.

576
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,280
This, of course, Driver, the big Atari franchise, which I remember most of all from Driver 3

577
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,800
because it was so god-awful, and I'm kind of surprised that they're actually making

578
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,360
a movie out of this, but whatever.

579
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,360
Hope the actors have bad AI is

580
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,280
They're like can't figure their way around walls

581
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,760
You know having trouble lots of polygon clipping in the movie shooting through cars. You know, it's gonna be fun

582
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:41,040
What do you think? Well the the connection of Silent Hill, which was a pretty good gaming movie

583
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,160
I think that's gonna help this or it nothing is gonna save this franchise. I think to be honest. Okay, he's a good

584
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:53,120
He's a good writer and it should be good. I don't know I have to admit even though I like Silent Hill the dialogue

585
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Kinda lame. Some of it was lame.

586
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,640
Okay, be honest, Driver, very vague story line.

587
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,920
It's car chase movie. Okay, that's basically what they can do. It's just like, you know,

588
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,520
House of the Dead, Zombie movie,

589
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,320
you know, Alone in the Dark, Supernatural movie,

590
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,720
Doom, Sci-Fi movie. I mean,

591
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,880
that's basically what it comes down to. There's no real definitive story line to

592
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,600
anything.

593
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,480
Well neither did Fast and the Furious and it sold. Yeah, they're making more of those

594
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,240
But well, it makes you feel better boys and girls. He also co-wrote Pulp Fiction

595
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:38,320
Okay, but here's the other thing too about this movie. It's gonna be very similar to the wheel man, which is coming out later. So

596
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,940
Whatever

597
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,080
Go ahead make your movie if it's good great. I'll see it if it's not

598
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Whatever. All right

599
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,400
Loki, we talk a lot about Konami on this show, but usually there's titles that really tend

600
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,480
to slip in under the radar, right?

601
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,780
Exactly.

602
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,080
Like this title coming to Japanese arcades.

603
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:08,480
Basically part of Japanese biggest English school, Nova, they've basically teamed up

604
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,880
with Konami to bring this English learning game that's going to be coming to arcades.

605
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:22,880
and titled Study Abroad by Gaming. It's going to be really interesting, basically a bunch

606
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,640
of mini games that are going to be taking you through language exercises and stuff like

607
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:36,480
that. To be honest, I wouldn't think of learning another language as my preferred arcade game

608
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,120
when I go to an arcade, but then again, I'm not Japanese. I hope I'm not the only one

609
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:48,400
and just sees the irony in that. A company in the past known for very bad translations

610
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:55,880
of games, say, I Feel Asleep, is teaching Japanese kids to learn English. How's that

611
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:05,160
gonna work? The truck have started to move. Are you in joy? I hope they've really put

612
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,280
some polish into it, cause I think Konami's gonna need it in this case. So this is like

613
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,880
brain age for the arcade lame no that's not a bad idea I might be kind of fun

614
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,840
maybe I'm just a bit brainy like they made those little shooter games there's

615
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,120
just a bunch of little silly mini games all put together like point blank I don't

616
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,940
know work with me here another news article

617
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,880
squeamish Square Enix and Taito of course they've been coming together

618
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,520
lately they're also going to be launching a music and film enterprise

619
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:44,120
What happens is that they came together with Faith Inc. which is a digital content solutions

620
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,680
provider and theyíre going to be coming together to form Brave Inc.

621
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,980
Theyíre going to be investing a total of 80 million yen in the startup, 10% coming

622
00:41:52,980 --> 00:42:00,760
from Squeenix, 30% from Taito and Faith going to contribute the other 60% there.

623
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,580
Brave is going to be working with ringtones, downloadable karaoke tracks, theyíre also

624
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:10,140
going to work with music and movie studios to produce and fund their own projects and

625
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:15,520
develop user communities around those movies and recording artists.

626
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,800
The new company will start up operations at the end of the month and all the earnings

627
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,300
will be reported under Faith Inc.

628
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:25,660
So kind of interesting there that they're going to be working a little more with music

629
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:31,800
and film, so possible tie-ins to later Squeenix titles, who knows?

630
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,620
Kind of a little blip, but that might turn into something big a little later on.

631
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,620
So I thought we'd mention it.

632
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,020
Loki, another movie piece.

633
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:46,560
Yes, now Silent Hill came out this week in the theaters, but that's not the only movie

634
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,980
that came out that was Silent Hill.

635
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:53,020
Silent Hill No Escape has actually been developed for a while now.

636
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:59,300
It's an all CG movie that's been done by a fan and I actually got to watch a little

637
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,580
bit of this and it's actually pretty good.

638
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,660
Pyramid Head in it. I haven't gotten that far yet.

639
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,980
So I don't know. I'm wavering down.

640
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,280
Better be. But anyways, it's definitely worth checking out. It's free.

641
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,600
If you're interested in checking out, they actually have a torrent for the

642
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,400
DVD image so you can burn it to a DVD and watch it.

643
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,080
And it's a long movie. It's about two hours long.

644
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,340
Some of the animation is a little rough, but it's definitely Silent Hill, so

645
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,920
check it out. noescape.rateofinjury.com

646
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,300
dot com and check it out there. They have a torrent

647
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,420
He's talking about actually... That's not like using the game to make movies right?

648
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,600
Or what do they call it? Red vs. Blue stuff.

649
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:46,940
This is a total CG movie that's been done. Wow. That's pretty hardcore.

650
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,860
Talk about a lot of time going into it.

651
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,940
But yeah, so definitely worth checking out. I mean

652
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,260
granted it may not be the greatest movie but

653
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,900
it's still worth checking out so yeah.

654
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:05,220
definitely look into that. You Will Bow to Me wants to know is the dialogue

655
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,020
better in this?

656
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,780
It's actually from what I've seen so far it's been silent.

657
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,500
So it's not just a clever name. It's actually

658
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,660
kind of a silent movie. But I think

659
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,100
I think there is dialogue later on but it is kind of

660
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:25,060
very creepy-ish. I mean you gotta check it out.

661
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:30,860
Some would say this woman is part CG but Angelina

662
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:36,460
Joe Lee has signed on to star as Lara Croft in Tomb Raider 3 and get this

663
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,300
She's gonna have to start training as soon as she pops out her next child, which I believe should be any day now

664
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:45,380
Right. I don't really follow the whole Brangelina thing, but I know they're in some country

665
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,340
Right now waiting to have their kid because they're trying to get away from the paparazzi right something like that

666
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:56,380
So right after she has a kid she's gonna go in training to be with Lara Croft one more time and she got to get

667
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,500
rid of that

668
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:03,500
that baby fat she's gonna get after having the kid and she's gonna get back into those tights and

669
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,760
Sign up for Tomb Raider 3 a little bit surprising is Tomb Raider 2 didn't do

670
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,260
Super good. I mean it did. Okay, they didn't do super good

671
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:17,320
So a little surprising but it's happening and that is the sound of them jumping on the bandwagon

672
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,120
Let the franchise die, please

673
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,100
I thought that was the sound of 14 and 15 year old boys everywhere

674
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,740
We've been asking for hard are Tomb Raider lots of nudity

675
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:35,100
Bring it do it. You already know she'll do topless. She'll do topless

676
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,020
She'll do full frontal too. That's right. Yeah. Oh, yeah

677
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:43,100
Well, she was she do full frontal after she's had the baby though. I don't know

678
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,580
Yeah, and I don't know if you want to see that. It's all right. That's why CG was invented

679
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,300
There is an actual movie out just downright horrible tonight

680
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,460
There's a dark soccer is not here to slap me for saying they have movie technology right now

681
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,980
They can get body double and they can just CG your head on there

682
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,760
And you know what? I've seen a movie like that and I was very disappointed that did that so

683
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,420
Comment from the chat room. I

684
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,300
Forgive forgive me if I had totally butcher your name here. I'm

685
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,380
Sioran says let her die. She already died in one of her games. I

686
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,420
I think more than one game, to be honest.

687
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:24,540
Yeah, but in the whole game it consisted of flashbacks. At least from what I understand, I never played that piece of crap.

688
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:28,340
Color of Sakura Sky, since when has a video game movie ever been good?

689
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:32,620
Silent Hill. Silent Hill? Silent Hill was good, I wouldn't say it was great,

690
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:36,460
but it was good. If you're gonna ask me when has a video game movie ever been great,

691
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,860
I'll probably say, I'll have to really rack my brain on that one if I can even think of one, but

692
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,180
Silent Hill was good, I just don't know about, you know, great.

693
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:49,180
Alright. Moving on. Loki.

694
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:55,180
Yes. As I mentioned earlier, one of the games coming into the revolution is Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

695
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:59,180
And actually, not only the revolution, but pretty much every other system out there.

696
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:07,180
One of the things though, if you did happen to pick up the May issue of Game Informer, you actually got to see some pictures of it.

697
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:11,020
looks pretty cool they've got some of the characters they featured spider-man

698
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:15,660
wolverine captain america thor doctor strange and ghost rider and silver

699
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:20,220
surfer and letra are going to be some of the playable characters basically this

700
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:25,900
game is going to kind of be very similar to the x-men legends franchise except

701
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:30,380
this time of course spanning a little bit beyond the x-men series so we're

702
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,780
talking dungeon crawler here so yeah basically and it looks pretty cool it's

703
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,600
It's kind of cel-shaded, I don't know.

704
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,160
It should be very similar to the other games, the other games were pretty good.

705
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,520
So worth checking out, might be at E3.

706
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:50,180
Let's see, one more thing, I don't know if this will be at E3, it seems a little early

707
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:56,580
for this, but LucasArts is developing a game based around Darth Vader, hmm, that should

708
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,180
be interesting there.

709
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:03,640
They're going to be, let's see, what's going on here, a Star Wars game, they outline a

710
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:08,560
new storyline that delve deeper into Darth Vader's history so maybe to

711
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,840
explain a little bit about what happened in that gap there between three and four

712
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:24,440
no press the a button to shout no god we're stupid all right Lucas arts just

713
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,560
needs to make another Sam a max game that I'll buy from him how about they go

714
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,540
back to some of that old-school PC stuff how about loom to bitch they're working

715
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,660
on a new Indiana Jones game.

716
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,500
Fine.

717
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,180
I'm sorry, because there's a new Indiana Jones movie, right?

718
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,740
Fair enough.

719
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,300
Fair enough.

720
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,460
Indiana Jones the game was pretty cool.

721
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,260

a sock but I we call it about tonight

740
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:33,140
about the the sequel to the greatest game ever was released this week

741
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:38,340
what's that mother three all with that all that mother three was released to

742
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,860
Japan I can't believe that didn't make our list for tonight

743
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:45,060
thank you for bringing this up hell yes earthbound is terrific game is

744
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,100
it have they said if they're gonna put this out in America not yet out they

745
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,260
still have no

746
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,580
no they haven't all I'm hoping it's Nintendo one in Nintendo's secrets for

747
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,300
e3 that would make me very happy

748
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,340
You guys really haven't talked about it much on the show, and I think a lot of

749
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,140
people don't really

750
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:04,700
know anything about it, so if I could do a short little spiel about the game and my

751
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,420
experience with it, if that's alright with you. I love the Mother series, go for it.

752
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,180
It shows all yours.

753
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:14,020
Okay, well, for people that don't know, Mother 3 is obviously the sequel to

754
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,540
Mother 2, which is

755
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:19,660
better known as Earthbound outside of Japan. That was an RPG

756
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,020
for the Super NES, recently made famous by the

757
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,540
Star, Ness, appearing in both Super Smash Bros.

758
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,500
Mother 3 was in development for about eight years.

759
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,980
It was even canceled once and then revived.

760
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,140
Mother 3 was finally released on like the 20th,

761
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:40,540
three days ago in Japan on the Game Boy Advance.

762
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:45,580
I gotta play a small portion of the game, but I really didn't want to spoil

763
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,300
anything

764
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,740
for me because I'm still praying that it's gonna come out outside of

765
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,260
Japan, which

766
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:58,040
I don't know when if if that's ever gonna happen, but I'm just hoping they'll say something at e3

767
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,660
fans of the original won't be disappointed because

768
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,300
mother 3 and mother 2 earthbound are

769
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:15,380
Connected to each other as much as two Final Fantasy games so new characters a new world but a lot of familiar stuff. Um

770
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:25,220
But I'm not surprised about this because Mother 1 was not connected to Mother 2 at all.

771
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:32,700
Probably the most interesting thing about Mother 3 was the beat rhythm.

772
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:41,580
The most important thing about Mother 3, and a lot of you beat rhythm game enthusiasts would

773
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:47,900
like is the battle system it has this weird music combo thing where um it's

774
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,700
the battle system is really music oriented so like each character kind of

775
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,540
has a musical they don't attack with the musical instrument but it makes a

776
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:02,820
musical instrument sound so um like when like the main character attacks it

777
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:08,980
sounds like a saxophone um but if you actually attack on the beat of the

778
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:14,740
battle music you get like a music combo but there's no visuals there's to like

779
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:19,060
you know make you aware of this it's all audio so you kind of gotta you know tap

780
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:23,340
along with the music or something I don't know how to explain I only got to

781
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,640
play it for a little bit well I'm gonna have to check it out at some point and I

782
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,140
know some folks in chat room are plugging this website www.starman.net

783
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,500
which I know is a huge earthbound community I want to say we used to have

784
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,420
a bunch of them that used to listen to show a while back we did we the hell

785
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,540
happen to them? I don't even know. We'll see if I support their crappy game if

786
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,420
they're gonna abandon us. No, I'm kidding. I love Earthbound. Nothing's

787
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,780
gonna change that. Actually, Starman.net had a long-standing petition to bring

788
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,740
Mother 3 into the US. Yeah, I'm sure there's petitions out there, right? I

789
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:57,580
signed that petition a long time ago. I'm a huge member of Starman.net and

790
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:02,540
that's if anybody wants to know anything about any of the Mother games, just

791
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,900
you know, check it out. Starman.net. Tell those kids at Starman.net to come

792
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,280
back we miss him yeah all right all right well thank you for reminding us

793
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,180

I also have to mention, I had to re-upload my

823
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:46,300
video that I posted today. I found out, because I've been trying to remember how I

824
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,540
uploaded the first two, how I encoded them. I did it wrong this time, so I uploaded

825
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:55,440
a 10 megabyte smaller file so download the new one if you haven't yet and that

826
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,780

00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:26,020

839
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,460
nuts

840
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:44,460
okay what um it was a while back maybe like three weeks ago he's talking about

841
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:51,460
about how full auto didn't have deathmatch or something like that?

842
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:56,640
and this was even longer ago that I told him about rush 1049 how it was another game with

843
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:01,980
guns and cars and something like that. Well apparently he didn't realize that I was talking

844
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:06,480
about it had a deathmatch mode.

845
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,420
okay

846
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:16,060
And if you're looking for like a car shooter with like deathmatch things like you should like look into that except

847
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,060
it doesn't have online but

848
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:24,580
It does have a four player multiplayer, which is really cool, and you can get it on five systems all four

849
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:31,500
Current gen ones including Dreamcast and gamecube ps2 and

850
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,620
and xbox with in a midway teachers 3

851
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:39,540
and you can get on the N64 if you have an older console

852
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,660
for okay retro sake cool

853
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,900

no waiting for you at ps3 right cool Nintendo maniac do you do you have to

856
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,740
prove us wrong on anything else tonight

857
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:58,420
I'm actually I'm I'm curious about this

858
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,900
Loki, I just said Loki, I meant Sky.

859
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,860
Oh, hooray, what?

860
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:09,000
You have a 360, correct? Yes. Okay,

861
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,160
is it a core or a premium? I bought a core but I bought the hard drive separate

862
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,320
because I bought it when

863
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:19,780
they were still going crazy about Xbox 360's and they were so hard to find

864
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,860
that I just allowed myself to get raped financially

865
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,540
and I bought a core and bought the hard drive separately, because the core was all I could get

866
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,820
at Best Buy, they were out of premiums.

867
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:31,020
Okay, so does this mean you have corded controllers?

868
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:34,660
Yes, all my controllers are corded.

869
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:38,540
I have three corded controllers.

870
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,140
And actually...

871
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,380
I said this like earlier today.

872
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,500
Do you know if it would even be possible

873
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,980
to charge a Xbox 360 controller off a PSP?

874
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:56,540
No, you don't have to charge the corded ones at all and I don't know...

875
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:01,380
Those are just USB they plug right in and yeah, I know I meant the wireless. Oh the wireless

876
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:05,320
I don't know you would not be able to because the PSP port it does not put the

877
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:12,380
You know the right output for USB and besides you'd have to have a some sort of converter cable do that anyway

878
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:15,540
Well, I mean if you have the converter, why would you want to do that? Anyways, though?

879
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:19,280
I mean it would be because you can why do people install Linux on things?

880
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,780
Well, here's the thing if you don't have the black just just keep if you're really that, you know

881
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:30,120
hard-pressed to charge the battery just keep the damn you know battery case it

882
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,120
comes with and put two double-a batteries in there I mean it'll work

883
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:37,680
just the same and otherwise you can you know find any other USB port in your

884
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,640
house on your computer on your PlayStation 2 or whatever and charge

885
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,800
your batteries away and well the thing is if you're charged on the PSP then you

886
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,560
can basically still have like a wireless controller you can like go all through

887
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:56,680
your house with you I know what I'm sorry it's for some reason is not

888
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,980
clicking for me I don't understand why you want to do that it's because you

889
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:07,160
can't because you can I guess wait was it that question to me yes why would you

890
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:15,400
want to do that well then you can go the 11 feet into the kitchen that your

891
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,440
Xbox 360 or it's not gonna let you go to but then the signals not gonna

892
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:24,340
reach so what good does it do? It's not going to reach 11 feet. Let me play this

893
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:29,780
way. Most people don't play 11 feet away from their TV okay that it's just retarded first

894
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,240
off because you're not going to be able to see your TV. Especially if you're playing

895
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:37,780
Final Fantasy 11. Assuming that you even want to do that. Hey my uncle's couch is like 15

896
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:41,900
feet away from his TV. Okay well that's retarded anyways it doesn't matter the whole thing

897
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:46,780
is if you're going to sit that far away anyways do one of two things okay if you're going

898
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:50,780
to go through the trouble to try to even hook it up to a PSP. The cable you're going to

899
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:55,880
buy anyways is going to be about the same price as an extension cable for USB. Just

900
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:02,220
buy a USB extension cable for like $6 or whatever and then put it out the extra 6 feet or whatever.

901
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:06,540
Those corded cables are long enough anyways. I don't really think you're going to need

902
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:12,420
to go that far. Granted, I'm sure if you've had other console systems that work with wireless

903
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:16,300
controllers then you're gonna have to be in the same situation anyways just

904
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:22,060
either sit closer to the TV or just wait for some time to you know freakin charge

905
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:25,360
those things or buy a goddamn quick charge kit and do it in like a couple

906
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:32,960
hours that's the best way to do it 15 feet away how big is the TV um I'm not

907
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:38,300
sure but it's pretty big you know it's it's it's it's for the porn listen okay

908
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,060
Wait, wait, wait, even if Jamie's TV and Jamie's TV is pretty huge, I would sit 15 feet away

909
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:44,060
from that thing.

910
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:47,020
She's got her couches right next to that TV, too.

911
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:48,020
There's not a lot of space.

912
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:49,020
Wait, wait, wait.

913
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:52,700
When I'm sitting in a movie theater, I'm not even probably sitting that much further than

914
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,420
15 feet away, and that's a pretty damn large screen.

915
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,220
If it were anything smaller than that, I would not be sitting 15 feet away.

916
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,220
All right.

917
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,740
Too much anger, Nintendo Maniac.

918
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:06,260
Good luck with your quest to charge the 360 controller using all sorts of household devices.

919
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:07,440
I wish you luck, okay?

920
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,200
Good luck with that, it's not going to work though, have a good one!

921
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
Uh, Rushtales49.

922
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:17,660
Alright, yeah, we got him for that, bye.

923
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,080
I love our listeners.

924
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,160
One more, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

925
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,160
Hello.

926
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,160
Hi.

927
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,160
Hi, who's this?

928
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,160
Can you hear me?

929
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,160
Yes I can.

930
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,160
Can you hear me?

931
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,160
I can.

932
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,160
This is Xander from East Berlin.

933
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,160
Hi, Xander from East Berlin, what's on your mind?

934
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,960
I don't think East Berlin exists anymore, does it?

935
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,800
I don't think so, you really fucked that up, but that's alright, what's on your mind?

936
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:46,560
Yeah, I don't know if you reported on this earlier or not, but did you hear about what

937
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:51,080
the Katamari guy said about the rev-mote earlier this week?

938
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:56,280
We didn't report on it, so why don't you put on your OLR reporter hat and tell us about

939
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,280
it.

940
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,440
Okay, hold on, I gotta search for it here.

941
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,440
It might be under my homework.

942
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,440
It might be under the shotgun shell, seeing as you're, you know, in East Berlin.

943
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,440
He's sad.

944
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,440
Yeah.

945
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:20,200
Okay, so basically, I don't have the exact quote with me right here, but basically he

946
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:25,200
said like Nintendo is putting too much focus on the, more or less he said that Nintendo

947
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:30,400
is putting too much focus on the controller and he just didn't really understand what

948
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,800
what exactly they're trying to do with it and it's kind of criticizing their strategy

949
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:39,080
with it, you know, in a way.

950
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,480
I'd get the exact quote if I had it in front of me, but I don't.

951
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,640
So basically the Katamari guy called Iwata a big smelly douche, correct?

952
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,640
No.

953
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,640
Not really.

954
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:50,640
That's how I interpret it.

955
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,600
It's just how Duatik is reporting it.

956
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,600
Oh, okay.

957
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,600
All right.

958
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,720
Well, what do you think?

959
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:05,560
Is this earth changing news or what, I mean, Katamari was done anyway, so, I mean, and

960
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:08,840
I don't think any of us expected it to be on the revolution, so, I don't know.

961
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,160
No, but he could have done something new, you know.

962
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,160
Yeah, well.

963
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,460
I think it would have been a good console if he did something new.

964
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:20,480
He needs to go back to designing his playground equipment and leave the video game world alone.

965
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:25,000
I want the death traps for children playground equipment, that would be awesome.

966
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,320
The one with the razor blade at the bottom of the slide?

967
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:31,640
like uh he should somebody should show him saw right before uh he has to uh

968
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:36,120
do his uh playground design silent field the playground

969
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:42,200

Loki any last minute stories tonight?

980
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,000
Just one.

981
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,680
So what is the next homebrew game coming to the PSP you may ask?

982
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,700
Well Starcraft.

983
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,680
They're working on porting over Starcraft.

984
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,180
What?

985
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:39,440
And apparently not much has been done so far but it's still early.

986
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:49,360
Starcraft PSP 1.2 A has been released and well not too much done yet just doing some

987
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:56,360
of the basic stuff, proof concept crap. But anyways, that's something fun.

988
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:02,920
That's it? You always have a ton of last minute stories, that's it? It's been slow, I've been

989
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:06,520
like filtering through stuff I don't want to talk about because it's retarded. Like

990
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,520
I don't like hearing people's opinions on crap like, what I think, rumors that we think

991
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:17,840
is going to happen on E3, or what we think is going to be coming out, yada yada yada.

992
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:22,140
obvious shit the revolution will have games I mean yes stuff like that it's

993
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:27,100
just getting a little bitter at the lack of news weeks before you three it is you

994
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:33,560
know been really slow but I've been really busy all right before we get to

995
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:38,420
tonight's last story I have to do an apology so cue the sad music I would

996
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:46,460
like to give my express apologies my severe condolences and apologies to

997
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:55,300
Shao Ran, not Sio Ran, because Shao Ran's getting sand in his vagina that I pronounced

998
01:06:55,300 --> 01:07:00,420
the name wrong. So I apologize for pronouncing your name wrong and horribly butchering it

999
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:09,420
earlier, but this is why I will forever be on amateur internet radio. So I apologize.

1000
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:13,420
I didn't mispronounce, you know, city by calling it bukkake.

1001
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:16,420
Alright.

1002
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:21,420
Moving on, one more story for you guys tonight.

1003
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,420
You know you love her, Paris Hilton.

1004
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:28,420
Or if you don't love her, you love to pretend that you're punching her in the face.

1005
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,420
Maybe while doing other dirty stuff. That's dirty!

1006
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,420
Stop thinking that! That's dirty, Andrew!

1007
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:36,420
That's so dirty!

1008
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:41,140
Ah, Gameloft has teamed up with Paris Hilton Entertainment

1009
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,940
Inc. to develop, publish, and distribute

1010
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:48,200
a line of cell phone games based on Paris Hilton.

1011
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,820
The bigger question we should be asking

1012
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:52,740
is, why is there a Paris Hilton Entertainment Inc.?

1013
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:53,980
That surprised me.

1014
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:55,540
Paris Hilton has a quote on this,

1015
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,260
the story originally coming from Kotaku.

1016
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,420
And they ran a quote here.

1017
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:01,180
Quote, I'm excited to collaborate with Gameloft

1018
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:03,580
to bring the Paris Hilton brand and the glamour

1019
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,620
of young Hollywood.

1020
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,860
Okay, there's nothing glamorous about her.

1021
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:10,180
To the cell phones of all my fans around the world,

1022
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:13,300
my phone has become an all-in-one entertainment device

1023
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,140
and mobile...

1024
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:18,420
Sorry, because I can't help but think about that list

1025
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,060
that got leaked and all the topless photos

1026
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,880
of her on the phone.

1027
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,340
Yeah, definitely a one-stop entertainment stuff.

1028
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,700
And mobile games are an integral part of that.

1029
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,660
Mobile gaming is really hot right now

1030
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:31,420
and I'm excited to be a part of this project.

1031
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:32,260
Well, that's...

1032
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:34,340
She doesn't use the word integral?

1033
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:38,340
Yes, some publicist put that out.

1034
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:43,340
Mobile games are an integral part of that. Yeah, she did not use that word.

1035
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:47,340
Unless there's a game that features a target over her, I ain't playing it.

1036
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:50,340
Integral? That right there is...

1037
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,340
That's a grown-up word.

1038
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:54,340
That's over her limit of syllables per word.

1039
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:57,340
Now, of course, that makes our chat room go wild.

1040
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:02,340
Popeanda21, I love the simple life. Did you lose a sock? I'm a slut, the game.

1041
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:05,540
you will bow to me Peter Jackson's one night in Paris

1042
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:08,780
the actual quote is probably like

1043
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:14,940
talkie device play game. DJ poo eater Paris Hilton the whore MMORPG

1044
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:19,100
I'd hit it with a baseball bat. You know what

1045
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,260
Paris Hilton mobile phone gaming

1046
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:27,100
these two shitty things deserve each other honestly I'm looking forward to

1047
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,620
seeing it on the next Engage

1048
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:32,060
I know there will be an Engage too. You bought an Engage didn't you? Launch title

1049
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:38,380
That's the question we have to ask Paris Hilton.

1050
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,380
We need to ask...

1051
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:40,380
Which we won't.

1052
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,380
You bought an N-Gage, didn't you?

1053
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,380
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

1054
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,100
Do you think Paris Hilton will be at E3?

1055
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,100
And then we can ask her?

1056
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,100
Do you think, do you think, do you think?

1057
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,100
Maybe.

1058
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,100
Oh, oh god.

1059
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,100
We need to somehow make that happen.

1060
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:55,020
Because there's a lot I want to ask her, and only a couple of it has to do with video games.

1061
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,740
But I know you want to hear it anyway, come on.

1062
01:09:56,740 --> 01:10:01,660
I wonder who's going to be at the Nintendo thing.

1063
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:05,280
the Nintendo thing is on Hollywood Boulevard, so that means that they'll try to get Hollywood

1064
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:09,460
types there. Where's it at on Hollywood Boulevard? Hollywood Boulevard is a dirty, dirty street.

1065
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:12,760
Are they having it? Well, last year- Is it Hollywood and Highland? Because that's kind

1066
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:17,720
of nice. Last year, yeah, it was right there. Oh, okay. Where the- Isn't the American Idol

1067
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:23,840
finale around that same time coming up? Um, I don't think so. No, I guess, where are they

1068
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,000
at? I think this was at the Paramount, I think. Oh, okay. Never mind. Wherever the hell that

1069
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,940
all right forget it um oh DJ poo eater says here's the question I could ask her

1070
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:37,700
what the shit are you doing at e3 you smelly dog-carrying poo face yeah that's

1071
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:43,900

1072
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:51,180
of Sinbad as well what the shit are you doing at e3 that's a great question I

1073
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,860

1076
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:07,700

1077
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:12,420
user submitted questions. We are guaranteed your ass is kicked out of E3. That's why we

1078
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:22,220
won't ask any of them until Friday. Good plan. Alright. That's it, that's the show. Let's
