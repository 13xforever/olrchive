2
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:22,142 --> 00:00:27,707
[SPEAKER_03]: This is April 23rd, 2006, our show for tonight, episode number 182.

4
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:31,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Kid Whatever from In The Groove is going to be here in just a little bit.

5
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:37,056
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, we've got some more news to get to, and Loki's going to start us off with Nintendo Revolution.

6
00:00:37,757 --> 00:00:39,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, go Revolution.

7
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:42,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, one of the games that's...

8
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:46,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Some form of it's coming to the Revolution.

9
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,911
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's the rumor according to Famitsu Magazine.

10
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:50,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be Knights.

11
00:00:50,892 --> 00:00:54,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Sega's Knights is going to be making an appearance on the Revolution.

12
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:58,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll definitely be interesting to play that with the Revolution controller.

13
00:00:59,498 --> 00:01:00,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know if it's going to be a new game.

14
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:01,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know if it's going to be a port.

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Do know it's going to be coming.

16
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:04,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Squee.

17
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:08,344
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of fans very excited about that.

18
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:10,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should make a new game.

19
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'd be cool because it's flying around stuff and I'd really work with the remote.

20
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Or controller.

21
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:20,949
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to keep calling it a remote because it looks like a remote but it's a damn controller.

22
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:21,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

23
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:51,419
[SPEAKER_03]: also a very popular series coming back officially announced this week on the Xbox 360 Fantasy Star Universe is going to be coming out well we all knew it was coming but Sega has now officially announced it there's going to be an epic story a single player adventure there's going to be of course the online mode as well real time battles where players choose their own strategies kind of different than most MMOs Fantasy Star is like an action based MMO a little more so especially than any other and

24
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:57,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Not entirely quite MMOs, more like a Guild Wars type MMO, Instanced Dungeons.

25
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:04,943
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically Diablo 2 in 3D, but don't tell a Phantasy Star fan that, because they might resent that.

26
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:07,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

27
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:08,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo 2 is a great game, but that's really what I felt.

28
00:02:08,944 --> 00:02:13,786
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first played Phantasy Star Online, I was like, this is Diablo 2 in space 3D.

29
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:15,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, that's what it felt like to me.

30
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:16,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, maybe I'm just weird.

31
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:19,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, what's the release date for this?

32
00:02:19,697 --> 00:02:20,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to see.

33
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:22,678
[SPEAKER_03]: It was somewhere on here.

34
00:02:23,658 --> 00:02:25,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's not on here, and we just announced it a couple weeks ago, right?

35
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in September, isn't it?

36
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,839
[SPEAKER_02]: We announced it a few weeks ago, and I don't have it in front of me.

37
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:30,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I would tell you.

38
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,980
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

39
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me do a find for the word September.

40
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,460
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not showing up, so much for that.

41
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:39,461
[SPEAKER_03]: So no official release date yet, although it's September.

42
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:40,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

43
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:44,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

44
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:08,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, that didn't come up either.

45
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:10,995
[SPEAKER_03]: So they didn't announce the official release date.

46
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:12,135
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's on PlayStation 2.

47
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:15,498
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing that they had announced on currently.

48
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:17,339
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd imagine it's coming out at the same time.

49
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.

50
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,043
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's coming out on Xbox 360, which is a little bit of a, oh, hey, cool.

51
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:23,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out there too.

52
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:25,965
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of folks will be picking it out there.

53
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:33,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully not as tricky to get signed up and play as it is with Final Fantasy XI.

54
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

55
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Phantasy Star was kind of...

56
00:03:37,993 --> 00:03:42,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy on the original Xbox to sign up and play, so I don't see why the Phantasy Star universe wouldn't be any different.

57
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on, I also have a story here.

58
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:48,542
[SPEAKER_03]: This ran on Kotaku.

59
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:54,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there is a lot of buzz around the internet this week about a new Kid Icarus game that's supposed to be happening.

60
00:03:54,568 --> 00:04:02,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's this artwork circulating around on the internet, and they're going, OMG, finally, Kid Icarus on the revolution, is it finally going to happen?

61
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:03,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

62
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:08,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it was actually published on a Korean game site that said that this was supposed to be happening.

63
00:04:08,143 --> 00:04:09,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what, guys?

64
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:11,945
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually... We lie to you!

65
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody got it from a DeviantArt website.

66
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:22,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Some guy made this on DeviantArt, and Kotaku actually links the dude's DeviantArt page, and there it is.

67
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:25,049
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the concept art for Kid Icarus Revolution.

68
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:29,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not this guy's fault, it's the Korean website's fault that sort of perpetuated the rumor, but...

69
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:34,053
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some fools right now who just need to be smacked straight off the face of the internet.

70
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:35,054
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

71
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:35,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

72
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:36,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you blame them?

73
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:37,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Kid Icarus?

74
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:42,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Kid Icarus is a beloved... It's a beloved Nintendo franchise for the past, what, 20 years now?

75
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:46,960
[SPEAKER_03]: That still has never really seen anything next-gen.

76
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:49,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they have something on Game Boy or something?

77
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:50,742
[SPEAKER_14]: They had a Game Boy release.

78
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:54,084
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a minor release, too.

79
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:55,105
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't even a major deal.

80
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:58,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're left hanging here, guys.

81
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:00,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it?

82
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why Nintendo does not want to touch this franchise again.

83
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:04,656
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't make sense to me.

84
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe they think they can't do it justice.

85
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:13,680
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they have... Wait, what about this flight game that they're doing with Hudson?

86
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:16,822
[SPEAKER_14]: You think they might have a cameo?

87
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:17,862
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

88
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:19,963
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little far-fetched, but... It is.

89
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:22,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Way too far-fetched.

90
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:28,887
[SPEAKER_02]: When they're talking about bombing runs and stuff, I don't think you're going to have Kid Icarus doing bombing runs.

91
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:30,991
[SPEAKER_02]: No thanks.

92
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:31,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

93
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:33,734
[SPEAKER_14]: The BOA Network had a lot of range when you upgraded it a lot.

94
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:35,155
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

95
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:39,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted the link there to the DVR on our page because some folks in chat were asking for it.

96
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,624
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to join our chat room, if you're listening live on Sunday night, www.orangelawntradio.com.

97
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:44,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat.

98
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,747
[SPEAKER_03]: But our chat room is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

99
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:47,988
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just pop in there any time.

100
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:49,009
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some lurkers.

101
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Magus, you lurk in there a little bit, don't you?

102
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:52,172
[SPEAKER_03]: All the time.

103
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:53,313
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I'm in there right now.

104
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:56,169
[SPEAKER_03]: You are, even though you're here.

105
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just watching myself do nothing.

106
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,531
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

107
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:05,273
[SPEAKER_03]: You're logging what people say about you in chat on what a horrible job you're doing tonight.

108
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:05,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm teasing.

109
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:06,234
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing great.

110
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:11,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've told no really bad jokes tonight, which I appreciate, might I say.

111
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:11,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it time.

112
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:12,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it time.

113
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:13,737
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have half the show to do.

114
00:06:14,237 --> 00:06:18,058
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki, some Xbox Live news.

115
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, lots of fun stuff.

116
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,520
[SPEAKER_02]: But first off, demos.

117
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:23,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Woods...

118
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:32,702
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, getting the demo on Xbox Live, as well as Amp 3, the game we gave away last week.

119
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:35,024
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely check those out if you haven't yet.

120
00:06:35,665 --> 00:06:42,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the Speed Pack's up there for Project Gotham Racing 3, as well as the more co-op stuff and new cameo downloads as well.

121
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:48,316
[SPEAKER_02]: And lots of stuff going to be coming, especially E3 week.

122
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:50,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about a demo for FIFA World Series.

123
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:53,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup Soccer 06, and more stuff like that.

124
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:56,932
[SPEAKER_02]: MotoGP 06, or 2006 is supposed to be coming too.

125
00:06:57,873 --> 00:06:58,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Which looked really cool.

126
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:00,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, excellent.

127
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:03,838
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep your eyes out on Xbox Live for that and plenty more demos.

128
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,640
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hoping a lot of good stuff during E3.

129
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:09,503
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just me though, does the marketplace need a facelift pretty bad?

130
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,426
[SPEAKER_03]: It's starting to get a little, it's just too much there.

131
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:18,051
[SPEAKER_03]: They need more user, it's not a user friendly system to me.

132
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:19,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Custom Gamer Picks

133
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:34,716
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

134
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,203
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to filter that.

135
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:05,017
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, because you could just put a big pair of titties right there as your gamer picture and there's no screening process.

136
00:08:05,037 --> 00:08:05,959
[SPEAKER_14]: They're probably going to have to...

137
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:09,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Filter and approve every single custom avatar.

138
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,293
[SPEAKER_03]: People putting offensive things like, you know, who knows.

139
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:16,095
[SPEAKER_03]: The postage stamps a while back.

140
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:16,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

141
00:08:16,636 --> 00:08:20,178
[SPEAKER_03]: People were putting like Hitler and things on postage stamps and there was a big no-no.

142
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,741
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think they might be opening up a huge can of worms we're not prepared for.

143
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:27,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and I think the Ghost Recon Vance Warfighter demo was on there too.

144
00:08:27,304 --> 00:08:28,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that came out a few weeks ago though.

145
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's an offline one now that's available.

146
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:35,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was an online one, now there's an offline one.

147
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:35,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

148
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:36,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't quote me on that.

149
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:38,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Just going off what I read.

150
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit, I don't follow a whole lot of the news of that series.

151
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:44,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of just go online and try to be surprised when I see stuff.

152
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:46,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, GK128 in chat agrees with me.

153
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:49,082
[SPEAKER_02]: The new demo is one player, as opposed to multiplayer.

154
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:50,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like those multiplayer demos.

155
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:54,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of cool, but you should have a demo that you get to pick whether it's multiplayer or not.

156
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:56,148
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just my thought.

157
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well it's been a little while since we've had an interview on the show, right Loki?

158
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:00,775
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit, yeah.

159
00:09:00,795 --> 00:09:06,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and we haven't really talked enough about music games tonight, so we should bring on somebody to talk about music games tonight, right Loki?

160
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:07,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.

161
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:12,661
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, we have another special guest on tonight's program, and that person is Kid Whatever.

162
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:18,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Music game fans recognize the name Kid Whatever from his contributions to the In the Groove series of games.

163
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:24,427
[SPEAKER_03]: If you watch the anime convention circuit, you may have also heard the buzz around his live appearance at SakuraCon last month.

164
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:27,368
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a new CD out called Hi, I'm Sorry I'm Late.

165
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:31,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought some records, and he's here with us tonight to talk about his recent accomplishments.

166
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Kid Whatever, are you there?

167
00:09:33,591 --> 00:09:33,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here.

168
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:34,471
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going?

169
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:35,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, pretty good.

170
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:36,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

171
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:37,133
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

172
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:37,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

173
00:09:38,523 --> 00:09:39,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tired.

174
00:09:39,484 --> 00:09:39,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Tired?

175
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:40,525
[SPEAKER_09]: What have you been up to?

176
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,086
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been exhausted.

177
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:46,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Non-stop stuff pretty much for the last month or so.

178
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:59,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Ever since getting ready for SakuraCon and playing up there, and then came home, got my album released, and then we shot a music video last week, which we just finished.

179
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:02,321
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's just been non-stop work, work, work.

180
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:03,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

181
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:05,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we check out that music video on your website, kidwhatever.com?

182
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,273
[SPEAKER_09]: You can, yep.

183
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:08,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

184
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:14,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first, I've got to go back to the past and kind of set the stage here for those that may not recognize your name.

185
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:16,175
[SPEAKER_03]: You're involved with the dance game In The Groove, right?

186
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:17,295
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.

187
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:19,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And how did you get hooked up with the In The Groove project?

188
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:30,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Kyle Ward, the main music producer, who I'm sure you guys are familiar with, he and I go way, way, way back to just being 19, 20-year-old DDR brats.

189
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:30,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

190
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:48,094
[SPEAKER_09]: When he got hooked up in the game, he just asked me if I wanted to take a shot at making a song for it, and I made While the Record Spins, and they put that on the test machine up in Seattle, and everybody loved it, so just kept going.

191
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:48,834
[SPEAKER_09]: We just ran with it.

192
00:10:49,535 --> 00:10:52,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, While the Record Spins isn't really credited to Kid Whatever, though, right?

193
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:57,120
[SPEAKER_09]: So you use multiple... Yeah, I have used a few different names for the game.

194
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,083
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, you know, if I want to explore a different kind of sound or something, I'll just...

195
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:03,654
[SPEAKER_09]: It's purposefully to confuse you.

196
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:17,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it worked.

197
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

198
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:19,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

199
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:20,292
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

200
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I noticed now you said in there that you and Kyle met through DDR.

201
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:26,055
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys were a fan of music games before In the Groove?

202
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:27,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

203
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:27,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Way back.

204
00:11:27,836 --> 00:11:28,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

205
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:29,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think about all that?

206
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this is a touchy subject, but I'm kind of curious what you think about all that controversy going back and forth.

207
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just stay far away from it or...

208
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:42,510
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as what the... Like, you know, the whole DDR in the groove.

209
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,411
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it kind of polarizes the fan base and all that stuff.

210
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:48,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Lawsuit and all that stuff.

211
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:51,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really know any details about the lawsuits.

212
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't really talk about that.

213
00:11:53,352 --> 00:11:57,593
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, there's room for both games, honestly.

214
00:11:57,693 --> 00:11:58,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I love them both.

215
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:01,934
[SPEAKER_09]: They both are good in different ways.

216
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,614
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't really see the point of

217
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:06,354
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, DDR versus In The Groove.

218
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,815
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's room for both games.

219
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Love them both.

220
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:10,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Embrace them.

221
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,097
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

222
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:16,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, obviously people in the community feel the same because In The Groove 3 was announced not that long ago, right?

223
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, you know, I don't know.

224
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:22,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure they had announced it at some arcade thing that they were going to do In The Groove 3, so...

225
00:12:26,023 --> 00:12:31,085
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple things that I've done.

226
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:42,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to do some more but we haven't really had much time to talk with that.

227
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:50,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Kyle and I have both been very busy with a lot of other things so hopefully pretty soon we'll get a chance to meet up and talk about that stuff.

228
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's still in the very early stages then?

229
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:57,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, as far as my contribution, yeah.

230
00:12:57,394 --> 00:12:58,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

231
00:12:58,895 --> 00:13:05,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now, outside of the In The Groove series, you played SakuraCon recently, and there was like, what, 2,000 people there?

232
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:06,738
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you get involved with that?

233
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:20,323
[SPEAKER_09]: A friend mentioned that SakuraCon was going on, and they were going to have a dance, and I just decided I wanted to DJ at it, and it was just pestering everybody I knew until I finally got to go up there and meet with them, and

234
00:13:21,038 --> 00:13:24,120
[SPEAKER_09]: They said, yeah, and they let me do it, and it was just awesome.

235
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,000
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so great.

236
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never played for that big of a crowd.

237
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:36,846
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, when I do shows here in Portland at home, there's maybe 50, maybe 100 people, and that was just incredible to see 2,000 people dancing to my stuff.

238
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:37,406
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.

239
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:40,307
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you plan on doing more of these anime shows in the future?

240
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:43,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is this going to be maybe a thing for you, traveling the convention circuit, or...?

241
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:44,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know yet.

242
00:13:45,413 --> 00:13:46,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to.

243
00:13:46,414 --> 00:13:51,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't really, like this one being here in the northwest, I was able to make connections pretty easily.

244
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:55,504
[SPEAKER_09]: But outside of that, I don't really know anybody, so...

245
00:13:57,202 --> 00:14:00,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, if you're out there, send me an email and let's talk about it.

246
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to play more of them.

247
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:02,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, awesome.

248
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:05,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's give them a sample right now of whatever it sounds like.

249
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:06,289
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to play a track.

250
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:14,955
[SPEAKER_03]: This song was included in In The Groove 1, which is available right now for PlayStation 2, as well as still some arcades out there that haven't upgraded to In The Groove 2 yet.

251
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:17,177
[SPEAKER_03]: But I believe this song carried over into In The Groove 2.

252
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:19,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now this is out on PC as well, right?

253
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:20,419
[SPEAKER_03]: In The Groove?

254
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it's coming out or just came out?

255
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:23,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

256
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:25,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it came out.

257
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it just recently came out.

258
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:28,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here it is, one of the tracks from the games.

259
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:32,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I like that sound by Kid Whatever here on Orange Lounge Radio.

260
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:48,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

261
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

262
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:51,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

263
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:53,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah!

264
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:55,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah!

265
00:14:56,857 --> 00:14:57,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah!

266
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:58,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah!

267
00:14:58,979 --> 00:14:59,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah!

268
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:00,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah!

269
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:01,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah!

270
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:01,741
Yeah!

271
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:02,182
Yeah!

272
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:02,622
Yeah!

273
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:03,803
I think I like how that sounds!

274
00:15:04,143 --> 00:15:04,464
Yeah!

275
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:05,625
I think I like how that sounds!

276
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:06,285
Yeah!

277
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,466
I think I like how that sounds!

278
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:08,107
Yeah!

279
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:08,567
Yeah!

280
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:09,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah!

281
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:09,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah!

282
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:09,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah!

283
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:11,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I like how that sounds!

284
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:11,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah!

285
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,931
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I like how that sounds!

286
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:13,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah!

287
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:14,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I like how that sounds!

288
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:22,930
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura

289
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:04,871
DJ Ranma

290
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:44,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I like that sound

291
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.

292
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:07,316
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a new CD out called Hi, I'm Sorry I'm Late.

293
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:08,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought some records.

294
00:18:08,597 --> 00:18:10,617
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I have to know, where's the title come from?

295
00:18:10,697 --> 00:18:11,697
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very unique title.

296
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:18,439
[SPEAKER_09]: The title came from... I feel like I should have had an album out a long time ago.

297
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:28,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's been a couple of plans in the works to put out like in the groove soundtrack CDs or CDs with my songs that are in the game.

298
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:31,603
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of those have fallen through repeatedly.

299
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:36,662
[SPEAKER_09]: So I finally decided, you know what, I'm just going to do it myself.

300
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:45,967
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's an apology, and I hope everybody will forgive me for not having something out sooner, and we can rock out together.

301
00:18:46,348 --> 00:18:46,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

302
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:54,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I was going to ask, do you think that the success of your songs in the In The Groove game is what enabled you to put together this CD?

303
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:58,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I probably would have done it anyway, even if it wasn't for the video game.

304
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,795
[SPEAKER_03]: What types of ways have you been marketing this CD out there?

305
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:05,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Mostly just word of mouth.

306
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:07,437
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really all I can do at this point.

307
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:08,898
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard.

308
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:20,466
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really difficult when there's so many people who are making electronic music and putting it on the internet that people just kind of have stopped paying attention.

309
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:27,992
[SPEAKER_09]: So just word of mouth, message boards, email lists, just telling everybody that I possibly can, hey, come check out my stuff.

310
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:33,071
[SPEAKER_09]: And we just made a music video, so hopefully that'll help a little bit too What's the music video for?

311
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:39,536
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for the song Disco Express And how did you come up with the concept for the music video?

312
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:40,557
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you guys do for it?

313
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:49,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I had me and about four friends over here And we just decided to basically make jackasses out of ourselves That's the way to do it, fun

314
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,123
[SPEAKER_03]: There was definitely an idea and it all kind of came together at the last minute.

315
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:55,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we spent five days on it total from concept to final edit.

316
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:08,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you should check it out.

317
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:11,168
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on my website at kidwhatever.com Pretty much non-stop Tetris BS.

318
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:11,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on it.

319
00:20:35,006 --> 00:20:38,889
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the first time since I was like 9 or 10 that Tetris has taken over my life.

320
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:47,415
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been hanging out on the internet a little bit, hanging out down at Backspace, a little internet cafe here in Portland, and kicking everybody's ass.

321
00:20:48,236 --> 00:20:52,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so are you willing to give out your friend code over on kidwhatever.com?

322
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I should totally put that up.

323
00:20:54,981 --> 00:20:55,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, right on.

324
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:57,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Check that out.

325
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:01,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else, any other projects or live shows coming up soon that you want to plug?

326
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:05,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing yet, just trying to plan a couple things.

327
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:09,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably going to have a CD launch party here next month in Portland, but it's still too early to say.

328
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:17,492
[SPEAKER_09]: But I definitely want to DJ and want to book some more gigs, so just keep watching on my website and I'll announce stuff as soon as I've got it all sorted out.

329
00:21:18,092 --> 00:21:18,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, awesome.

330
00:21:18,772 --> 00:21:22,613
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep an eye on Kid Whatever over at www.kidwhatever.com.

331
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:24,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, thanks so much for being on the program tonight.

332
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:25,613
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate it.

333
00:21:26,113 --> 00:21:26,453
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.

334
00:21:26,473 --> 00:21:27,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me on, Rob.

335
00:21:27,414 --> 00:21:28,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, best of luck to you with your CD.

336
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:29,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

337
00:21:30,814 --> 00:21:31,594
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.

338
00:21:31,854 --> 00:21:32,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad he can come on.

339
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:48,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, the next story we have is coming from... It's actually talking about the Major League Gaming finally coming to the USA Network, which is interesting because I've never heard of Major League Gaming, but it should be cool.

340
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:59,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Wall Street Journal was reporting that they basically have signed a deal to do a series of seven hour-long shows that are going to be airing on Saturday morning starting this fall.

341
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:08,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Featuring competitions between gamers ranging from really serious games from Halo 2 and Super Smash Bros.

342
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:14,603
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be interesting because I remember they tried something like this with Arena on G4.

343
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:19,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it was an okay show, but I don't know.

344
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:22,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you see, the problem with that show is that it was on G4.

345
00:22:24,332 --> 00:22:26,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you watched G4 lately?

346
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:27,093
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually no.

347
00:22:27,173 --> 00:22:29,793
[SPEAKER_03]: It was old school G4.

348
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:31,974
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

349
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:35,134
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually one of the better shows on the network probably.

350
00:22:37,395 --> 00:22:40,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most things on G4, it kind of went downhill as time went on.

351
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:42,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I sat today.

352
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:45,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually flipped to G4 to see if there was anything on.

353
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:49,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I flipped ahead seven hours in advance.

354
00:22:49,677 --> 00:22:54,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have had to wait seven hours before I actually saw any programming that had anything to do with games.

355
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,065
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how bad it's gotten.

356
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:57,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it Star Trek 2.0 all day?

357
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:04,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Trek Next Generation, Fastlane, Brainiac, Banzai.

358
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:06,388
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what they should do during E3?

359
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:10,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget protesting outside the convention center.

360
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,590
[SPEAKER_03]: People should be protesting outside G4's booth.

361
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring back gaming television.

362
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,591
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what people should be doing.

363
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:19,772
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's all in the same patterns MTV.

364
00:23:20,152 --> 00:23:21,972
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if G4's booth... Same exact patterns.

365
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:24,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but at least MTV stuff, they kind of have, you know,

366
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:26,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Some music related stuff.

367
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:28,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of music related.

368
00:23:28,498 --> 00:23:30,861
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll have music artists doing shows and stuff like that.

369
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:33,864
[SPEAKER_02]: This has nothing to do with anything.

370
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:35,186
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Star Trek.

371
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:37,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a word of advice, kiddies.

372
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:43,617
[SPEAKER_03]: If G4's booth is in the same place it was at last year, you don't have to have a badge to get there.

373
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:48,662
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's in the lobby and it's even before the place where you pick up your badge holders.

374
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:55,826
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could go and if you wanted to, I don't know, protest, hold up a few signs where the cameras are, let them know what you think, what's going on.

375
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:56,867
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be there.

376
00:23:57,267 --> 00:23:58,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Rabble, rabble, rabble.

377
00:23:58,247 --> 00:23:58,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

378
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:01,630
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to cause some rabble, just saying, not that I'm encouraging it, but I'm just saying.

379
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,773
[SPEAKER_03]: If you wanted to exercise your free speech and protest right and gather right, you could do it.

380
00:24:07,605 --> 00:24:08,225
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

381
00:24:24,177 --> 00:24:28,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, moving on to another story here.

382
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:39,208
[SPEAKER_03]: The official Nintendo magazine might be hinting a little bit at when they're going to be actually putting out the Nintendo Revolution.

383
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:46,033
[SPEAKER_03]: An upcoming issue of the official Nintendo magazine divulges info on Sega's upcoming Revolution games.

384
00:24:46,713 --> 00:24:55,800
[SPEAKER_03]: The article also promises a look at Activision's big project, which I assume is probably the Tony Hawk game, and Ubisoft's groundbreaking revolution title.

385
00:24:56,181 --> 00:25:01,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Another page seems to hint at the finalized date of the release for the revolution, 27th of October.

386
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:08,290
[SPEAKER_03]: This, of course, would line up with the whole we're going to launch before Thanksgiving comment, although that should be more of a duh because

387
00:25:08,652 --> 00:25:11,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, your console's got to launch before Thanksgiving if you want it to be successful.

388
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:15,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So, 27th of October, sound reasonable?

389
00:25:15,338 --> 00:25:16,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Sound a little early?

390
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:16,899
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

391
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:18,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds about right.

392
00:25:18,761 --> 00:25:19,141
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

393
00:25:19,861 --> 00:25:20,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Time will tell.

394
00:25:20,722 --> 00:25:22,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, this is just kind of another big question mark.

395
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:24,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what else you got?

396
00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:26,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.

397
00:25:27,768 --> 00:25:30,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love when people cause violence over video games.

398
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:35,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, actually, in, uh, Nagasaki, um,

399
00:25:36,624 --> 00:25:40,827
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically had two teenage brothers fighting over a video game console.

400
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,488
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them ended up dead.

401
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:45,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Two enter, one leaves with the console.

402
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:56,116
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, seriously enough, close to midnight, apparently two siblings, one 13-year-old and one 15-year-old, fought at home about putting away the video game console.

403
00:25:56,636 --> 00:26:03,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Young brother was punched and kicked repeatedly until he was unconscious and died later in the hospital.

404
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:11,817
[SPEAKER_02]: First World of Warcraft and now video game consoles When will the tragedy end?

405
00:26:11,978 --> 00:26:13,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was their parents?

406
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:22,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just waiting for the revolution to come out When you actually will be able to use the revmotes to beat them into submission There can be only one

407
00:26:24,505 --> 00:26:35,771
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, stories about stupid people like that that kill other people over gaming systems make us really mad and get us angsty and that means it's time to bring on the anthem for the FUs of the week.

408
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:52,980
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura no esta aqui tonight so Loki, you gotta start us off tonight.

409
00:26:54,897 --> 00:27:24,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I dislike Rockstar and their lack of programming ability in Grand Theft Auto or at least lazy programming that's in there I shouldn't have to find out later, six months later while enjoying the really wonderful single player game in Grand Theft Auto that the multiplayer does not work correctly especially the multiplayer in teams because you don't want to try it out that fucking sucks and really more attention should be brought to this type of thing because we've seen it with San Andreas and how they left in the hot coffee stuff

410
00:27:24,574 --> 00:27:28,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're just leaving out parts of code for, you know, the multiplayer.

411
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:31,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking release complete games.

412
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:32,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop patching your games.

413
00:27:32,557 --> 00:27:35,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop releasing, you know, stuff that's not finished and not working.

414
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:41,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sick and tired of goddamn game publishers out there just dropping the ball on the stuff saying, Hey, you know what?

415
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:42,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

416
00:27:42,222 --> 00:27:43,082
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll fix it later.

417
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:53,959
[SPEAKER_03]: My AFU of the week goes to the cunt that broke into my car sometime over the week and that's the third time now since I've lived in this apartment complex my car has been broken into.

418
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,062
[SPEAKER_03]: The good news is that this time the alarm scared him off because the first time I was like, okay, whatever, cars get broken into.

419
00:28:00,082 --> 00:28:02,743
[SPEAKER_03]: The second time I was like, okay, I'm getting an alarm on this fucker, seriously.

420
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:03,884
[SPEAKER_03]: This time...

421
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:06,245
[SPEAKER_03]: They broke the window and that was it.

422
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:09,828
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't even bother to take the radio or anything because the alarm obviously scared them off.

423
00:28:09,848 --> 00:28:11,869
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you learned your lesson, you stupid thief.

424
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:17,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do people feel the need to steal things from out of my car right in front of my own damn house?

425
00:28:18,754 --> 00:28:20,655
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like I live in that ghetto of an area.

426
00:28:20,695 --> 00:28:21,856
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually kind of nice over here.

427
00:28:22,156 --> 00:28:24,558
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the problem is the other side of the freeway is where the ghetto is.

428
00:28:24,858 --> 00:28:26,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think they all come over here to break into our cars.

429
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And seriously, I call the apartment complex to kind of complain, like what the hell is security doing?

430
00:28:30,902 --> 00:28:31,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just like...

431
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's just part of living in Sacramento.

432
00:28:35,906 --> 00:28:39,168
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, okay, I've lived in Sacramento, bitch, my whole life.

433
00:28:39,988 --> 00:28:41,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've never had my car broken into until I lived here.

434
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:48,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So, needless to say, Orange Lounge Radio Studio 4 in October because I'll be moving out of this place.

435
00:28:48,234 --> 00:28:48,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

436
00:28:48,754 --> 00:28:50,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a good thing they haven't broken in here yet.

437
00:28:51,556 --> 00:28:52,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to steal something.

438
00:28:52,957 --> 00:28:53,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the equipment.

439
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:55,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine if the Orange Lounge Radio equipment got stolen?

440
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:57,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be something else?

441
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:01,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Andrew, you're FU of the week.

442
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:02,234
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

443
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:04,641
[SPEAKER_14]: This has been holding out for a long time.

444
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:05,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, maybe a week.

445
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:06,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe a week.

446
00:29:06,507 --> 00:29:07,068
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a long time.

447
00:29:08,031 --> 00:29:08,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

448
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:09,496
[SPEAKER_14]: FU to these...

449
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Just masses of people who are just overreacting.

450
00:29:13,941 --> 00:29:24,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, if you go to GameFacts.com, you'll notice that Cinez kind of changed the logo, changed the design of the site around to match more with their sister site of GameSpot.

451
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:27,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, we have all sorts of people on the forum.

452
00:29:27,805 --> 00:29:28,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Did they really?

453
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:29,145
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen yet.

454
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:29,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm going to look.

455
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they are changing things around like that.

456
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:37,948
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have a nice little GameSpot logo piggybacking on the GameFacts logo.

457
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:48,638
[SPEAKER_14]: and for such a minor cosmetic change, people are freaking out left and right, saying that, uh, basically... It's just because it's another reminder that they sold out to the man.

458
00:29:49,279 --> 00:30:06,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it was that or have the site go under, but there are just people just freaking out over this, over what's just a cosmetic change, saying, soul, a site is gone, and now that the administrators are offering add-on premium services...

459
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:10,663
[SPEAKER_14]: They say, oh my god, now the entire site is going to pay.

460
00:30:11,164 --> 00:30:13,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, fucking chill out.

461
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:16,355
[SPEAKER_14]: What is there is gonna be free.

462
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:19,563
[SPEAKER_03]: What is new might be paid.

463
00:30:19,683 --> 00:30:21,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I have to play Devil's Advocate for a minute here.

464
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:24,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying I personally feel this way.

465
00:30:24,025 --> 00:30:24,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's Devil's Advocate.

466
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:32,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is mostly a user content site, is that why people are maybe a little miffed at this whole thing with the GameSpot logo?

467
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:33,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I wrote that back.

468
00:30:33,552 --> 00:30:34,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want GameSpot's name attached to it.

469
00:30:35,173 --> 00:30:37,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Only because they can't read.

470
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:42,958
[SPEAKER_14]: All of the user-submitted stuff is copyrighted by that user.

471
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:46,160
[SPEAKER_14]: GameSpot CNET has to talk to them.

472
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:57,357
[SPEAKER_14]: and have them sell their FAQ to CNET for them to have it on a premium contest system.

473
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:59,759
[SPEAKER_14]: They gave it, but they still have the copyright over it.

474
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:02,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything that is free will stay free.

475
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:04,943
[SPEAKER_14]: So people just need to shut the fuck up.

476
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,604
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a cosmetic chain.

477
00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:08,905
[SPEAKER_14]: It's nothing more than that.

478
00:31:09,386 --> 00:31:09,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously.

479
00:31:10,186 --> 00:31:10,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Chill.

480
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:13,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you can address those cards and letters too.

481
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:14,970
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your name over on the GameFAQ forum?

482
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,431
[SPEAKER_03]: The 23rd Megas.

483
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:16,771
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

484
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:19,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you a mod over there?

485
00:31:20,497 --> 00:31:24,542
[SPEAKER_14]: I applied to be a mod, got rejected, had sort of a user map issue.

486
00:31:25,443 --> 00:31:26,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Why did they reject you?

487
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,026
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a user map issue.

488
00:31:28,106 --> 00:31:31,130
[SPEAKER_14]: I was sort of logging in from work and my user map was huge.

489
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,853
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't think it was exactly secure.

490
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:35,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, please.

491
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,390
[SPEAKER_14]: At least that was the reason they gave you that.

492
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it help if we wrote a letter endorsing you?

493
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:38,471
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

494
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:39,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that help?

495
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:39,371
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

496
00:31:39,391 --> 00:31:41,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that might hurt you, because we're a no-name site?

497
00:31:41,572 --> 00:31:44,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you want to mod GameFAQs, to be honest?

498
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:44,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

499
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:45,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been there for, like, five years.

500
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:48,555
[SPEAKER_02]: They have pretty big message forums, and, you know, you might make friends there.

501
00:31:48,755 --> 00:31:52,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the message forums is, like... That's almost, like, MySpace-ish.

502
00:31:52,817 --> 00:31:53,057
[SPEAKER_02]: They're...

503
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:55,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, okay, okay.

504
00:31:55,194 --> 00:32:00,057
[SPEAKER_14]: There are parts that are pretty goddamn dumb, but you can find little nuggets of intelligence there somewhere.

505
00:32:00,237 --> 00:32:00,577
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

506
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:05,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet people try to find a game on there that's like really old school, like on an Atari 20s.

507
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:09,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, hey, let's all go meet on the Keystone Capers forums.

508
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:10,164
[SPEAKER_03]: People do that.

509
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:10,924
[SPEAKER_14]: I have done that.

510
00:32:11,044 --> 00:32:12,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a secret board.

511
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:16,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's not so secret anymore, but I don't want to say it on the air.

512
00:32:16,988 --> 00:32:17,929
[SPEAKER_14]: But people have done that.

513
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:19,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I know what it is because you told me before.

514
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you.

515
00:32:20,611 --> 00:32:21,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be nice.

516
00:32:21,111 --> 00:32:22,152
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not telling anyone else.

517
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:22,792
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be nice.

518
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:26,654
[SPEAKER_14]: But seriously, you can find some intelligence on there.

519
00:32:26,754 --> 00:32:35,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, not as often on places like Random Insanity, but occasionally on current events on some of the secret boards, you can find a lot of good content.

520
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:37,219
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

521
00:32:37,819 --> 00:32:39,860
[SPEAKER_14]: But people are just freaking out over nothing, I think.

522
00:32:40,421 --> 00:32:41,061
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, there you have it.

523
00:32:41,081 --> 00:32:43,042
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, views of the week, boys and girls.

524
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:44,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Take them or leave them.

525
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:45,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

526
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,174
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another list.

527
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought a top 10 list.

528
00:32:49,575 --> 00:32:53,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I've got a top 100 list coming from Next Generation Reports.

529
00:32:53,778 --> 00:32:57,061
[SPEAKER_03]: That's next-gen.biz.

530
00:32:57,441 --> 00:33:04,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Develop Magazine mentioned what the top 100 development studios are.

531
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:05,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, did they list them all.

532
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:12,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts off with 100 is Hudson, 99 Magic Pockets, and all the way through.

533
00:33:13,313 --> 00:33:13,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

534
00:33:13,873 --> 00:33:15,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, we get to the top 10.

535
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:19,931
[SPEAKER_03]: at some point here, and let me see if I can get to the top 10 real quickly here.

536
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,862
[SPEAKER_03]: 10.

[SPEAKER_03]: EA Canada

00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:51,076
[SPEAKER_03]: was named as the number one development studio.

548
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:54,138
[SPEAKER_03]: What the criteria were, I'm not quite sure here.

549
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:57,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can check that out here on the beginning of the articles.

550
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very curious.

551
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,682
[SPEAKER_03]: How did they determine what was the 100 here?

552
00:34:04,203 --> 00:34:04,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

553
00:34:06,484 --> 00:34:10,726
[SPEAKER_03]: It's saying that Develop is a definitive success game studio.

554
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:13,308
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ranked in terms of their UK sales.

555
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:14,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

556
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:15,989
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

557
00:34:16,926 --> 00:34:18,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll check that out if you want to.

558
00:34:18,387 --> 00:34:19,888
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from Develop Magazine.

559
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Lists always sure to cause controversy there.

560
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:25,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Comments from our chatroom.

561
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:28,374
[SPEAKER_03]: HitStun says, no treasure, that list fails.

562
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Point taken.

563
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:32,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

564
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:34,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

565
00:34:35,378 --> 00:34:36,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what do you got for us?

566
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:37,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Another list.

567
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:39,641
[SPEAKER_02]: This time it's a good list.

568
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:42,923
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a list of the games that Capcom's going to have playable at E3.

569
00:34:43,084 --> 00:34:43,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Goody goody.

570
00:34:44,685 --> 00:34:46,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off with PlayStation 2, we have Okami.

571
00:34:47,383 --> 00:34:49,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, which I think was playable last year too.

572
00:34:49,744 --> 00:34:51,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want to say it was shown last year too.

573
00:34:51,645 --> 00:34:53,586
[SPEAKER_02]: God Hand, which looks pretty cool.

574
00:34:53,986 --> 00:34:55,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter Alpha Anthology.

575
00:34:56,807 --> 00:34:57,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, another collection.

576
00:34:59,088 --> 00:35:01,649
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 360, Lost Planet and Dead Rising.

577
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:03,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah, Dead Rising is going to be awesome.

578
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:08,312
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP, Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins and Monster Hunter Freedom.

579
00:35:09,752 --> 00:35:11,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprisingly missing would be the

580
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:19,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Powerstone Collection, and the Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded, and the Capcom Puzzle Collection.

581
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:31,653
[SPEAKER_02]: DS, Mega Man ZX, and Game Boy Advance, Mega Man Battle Network 6, Psybeast Gregor, and Psybeast Falzar are the two games that they're going to have for that.

582
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:36,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Comments from our chatroom over at OrangeSoundsRadio.com.

583
00:35:36,194 --> 00:35:38,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this nickname, Control-Alt-Effed.

584
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:43,339
[SPEAKER_03]: says, Capcom, home to the endless Mega Man game sequels.

585
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:45,779
[SPEAKER_03]: And DJ PooEater follows up with Mega Man XXX.

586
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,800
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

587
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom has done a lot of Mega Man.

588
00:35:51,521 --> 00:35:54,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the hell is my Mega Man Legends sequels?

589
00:35:54,621 --> 00:35:55,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, seriously.

590
00:35:56,222 --> 00:35:57,202
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good series.

591
00:35:57,702 --> 00:36:02,783
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be, you know, hey, if you don't want to continue it on with the, you know, PS2 or whatever, PSP,

592
00:36:03,632 --> 00:36:05,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring it on the revolution or something.

593
00:36:05,173 --> 00:36:06,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, remake the first game.

594
00:36:06,853 --> 00:36:07,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it bigger.

595
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:11,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I've heard rumors that ZX is going to have a couple of ties to the Legend series.

596
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:13,995
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if those are confirmed or not.

597
00:36:14,295 --> 00:36:19,917
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Mega Man Z was last year's DS title.

598
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:22,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was just another side-scroller game.

599
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:26,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Cook in our chatroom says, Needs more Phoenix Wright.

600
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

601
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, they are translating the Phoenix Wright sequels.

602
00:36:32,399 --> 00:37:00,642
[SPEAKER_14]: but for mobile phone however it would not be too hard for people who are into say ROM hacking to take the translated scripts for the mobile versions and insert them into the Japanese GBA games so we'll have to see how that turns out well that's a lot of game I never got into Phoenix Wright Phoenix Wright they're just sold out right now that's all they're making more

603
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:09,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I mention that they were making the tentative date for the DDR Mario Mix was in May, May 17th?

604
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:13,757
[SPEAKER_03]: What, for the new Mario Mix?

605
00:37:13,937 --> 00:37:17,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not new, but it's being brought back out because it's been sold out since October.

606
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:20,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think you said May 17th or something.

607
00:37:21,165 --> 00:37:22,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where the hell you got that from, though.

608
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:28,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Roz in chat is pissed because I called her Dance Cook.

609
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:29,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, you changed your nickname.

610
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,262
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm going to credit your comments to, so just be careful.

611
00:37:35,204 --> 00:37:39,547
[SPEAKER_03]: If you change your nickname to I'm Stupid, I'm going to say, Hey, I'm Stupid in chat says this.

612
00:37:40,307 --> 00:37:44,490
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

613
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Something I ought to try.

614
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:52,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you change your nickname to something derogatory about myself or Loki or DarkSakura, then I just won't read your damn comments at all.

615
00:37:53,156 --> 00:37:53,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.

616
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:55,324
[SPEAKER_03]: So, got you there.

617
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:57,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, another story here.

618
00:37:57,995 --> 00:38:00,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Movie, movie, movie madness tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.

619
00:38:00,497 --> 00:38:06,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we talked about Silent Hill in the first half, and Roger Avery played a big part of the Silent Hill script there.

620
00:38:06,502 --> 00:38:06,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

621
00:38:07,063 --> 00:38:09,925
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also going to be writing Driver.

622
00:38:10,285 --> 00:38:12,547
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only is he writing it, he's directing it.

623
00:38:12,587 --> 00:38:21,455
[SPEAKER_03]: This, of course, Driver, the big Atari franchise, which I remember most of all from Driver 3 because it was so god-awful.

624
00:38:21,835 --> 00:38:25,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm kind of surprised that they're actually making a movie out of this, but whatever.

625
00:38:25,238 --> 00:38:25,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they do.

626
00:38:25,578 --> 00:38:27,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the actors have bad AIs.

627
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,840
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, can't figure their way around walls, you know, having trouble.

628
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of polygon clipping in the movie?

629
00:38:33,341 --> 00:38:35,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Shooting through cars, you know.

630
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:35,801
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be fun.

631
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,002
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

632
00:38:37,362 --> 00:38:45,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Will the connection to Silent Hill, which was a pretty good gaming movie, you think that's going to help this, or nothing is going to save this franchise?

633
00:38:45,224 --> 00:38:49,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, to be honest, okay, he's a good writer, and it should be good.

634
00:38:49,986 --> 00:38:53,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I have to admit, even though I like Silent Hill, the dialogue...

635
00:38:55,262 --> 00:38:58,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, neither did Fast and the Furious and it sold.

636
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:25,045
[SPEAKER_02]: TheWheelMan

637
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:55,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

638
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this title coming to Japanese arcades.

639
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:15,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, part of Japanese biggest English school, Nova, they basically teamed up with Konami to bring this English learning game that's going to be coming to arcades.

640
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:19,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Titled Study Abroad by Gaming.

641
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:23,663
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be really interesting.

642
00:40:24,223 --> 00:40:29,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically a bunch of mini-games that are going to be taking you through language exercises and stuff like that.

643
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:38,213
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, I wouldn't think of learning another language as my preferred arcade game when I go to an arcade, but then again...

644
00:40:40,134 --> 00:40:40,754
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not Japanese.

645
00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:43,815
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope I'm not the only one who just sees the irony in that.

646
00:40:44,556 --> 00:40:54,699
[SPEAKER_14]: A company in the past known for very bad translations of games, say, I Feel Asleep, is teaching Japanese kids to learn English.

647
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:56,380
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that gonna work?

648
00:40:58,841 --> 00:40:59,961
[SPEAKER_14]: The truck have started to move.

649
00:41:00,381 --> 00:41:01,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you in joy?

650
00:41:02,842 --> 00:41:08,364
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope they've really put some polish into it, because I think Konami's gonna need it in this case.

651
00:41:08,956 --> 00:41:09,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Sqeenix

652
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:33,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Square Enix, and Taito, of course, they've been coming together lately.

653
00:41:33,484 --> 00:41:37,307
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also going to be launching a music and film enterprise.

654
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:47,695
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens is that they came together with Faith Inc., which is a digital content solutions provider, and they're going to be coming together to form Brave Inc.,

655
00:41:48,015 --> 00:41:59,660
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be investing a total of 80 million yen in the startup, 10% coming from Squeenix, 30% from Taito, and Faith going to contribute the other 60% there.

656
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:05,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Brave is going to be working with ringtones, downloadable karaoke tracks.

657
00:42:05,243 --> 00:42:10,465
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also going to work with music and movie studios to produce and fund their own projects and develop...

658
00:42:11,305 --> 00:42:14,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Develop user communities around those movies and recording artists.

659
00:42:15,486 --> 00:42:21,347
[SPEAKER_03]: The new company will start up operations at the end of the month, and all the earnings will be reported under Faith Inc.

660
00:42:21,407 --> 00:42:28,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of interesting there that they're going to be working a little more with music and film, so possible tie-ins to later Squeenix titles.

661
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:29,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

662
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:30,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

663
00:42:31,689 --> 00:42:35,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a little blip, but that might turn into something big a little later on, so I thought we'd mention it.

664
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, another movie piece.

665
00:42:39,031 --> 00:42:39,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

666
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:47,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Silent Hill came out this week in the theaters, but that's not the only movie that came out that was Silent Hill.

667
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:52,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill No Escape has actually been developed for a while now.

668
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:57,303
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an all-CG movie that's been done by a fan.

669
00:42:58,103 --> 00:43:01,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got to watch a little bit of this, and it's actually pretty good.

670
00:43:01,886 --> 00:43:02,647
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Pyramid Head in it.

671
00:43:03,596 --> 00:43:04,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gotten that far yet.

672
00:43:04,818 --> 00:43:05,680
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

673
00:43:06,701 --> 00:43:07,843
[SPEAKER_12]: Thumb wavering down.

674
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:08,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Better be.

675
00:43:09,365 --> 00:43:11,128
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, it's definitely worth checking out.

676
00:43:11,228 --> 00:43:12,089
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free.

677
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:19,300
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're interested in checking out, they actually have a torrent for the DVD image so you can burn it to a DVD and watch it.

678
00:43:19,938 --> 00:43:41,188
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's it's a long movie it's about two hours long um some of the animation is a little rough but it's definitely Silent Hill so check it out noescape.rateofinjury.com and check it out there um they have a torrent um he's talking about actually that's not like using the game to make movies right or what do they call it red versus blue stuff no this is a

679
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:45,515
[SPEAKER_02]: A total CG movie that's been done.

680
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,616
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty hardcore.

681
00:43:46,636 --> 00:43:51,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about a lot of time going into it.

682
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:53,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely worth checking out.

683
00:43:54,302 --> 00:43:59,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, it may not be the greatest movie, but it's still worth checking out.

684
00:44:01,548 --> 00:44:02,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely look into that.

685
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:05,892
[SPEAKER_02]: YouWillBowToMe wants to know, is the dialogue better in this?

686
00:44:07,874 --> 00:44:10,616
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually, from what I've seen so far, it's been silent.

687
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:13,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so it's not just a clever name.

688
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:15,514
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually kind of a silent movie.

689
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:19,159
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there is dialogue later on.

690
00:44:19,219 --> 00:44:22,483
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is kind of very creepy-ish.

691
00:44:23,144 --> 00:44:25,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you've got to check it out.

692
00:44:25,568 --> 00:44:25,788
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

693
00:44:27,654 --> 00:44:34,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Some would say this woman is part CG, but Angelina Jolie has signed on to star as Lara Croft in Tomb Raider 3.

694
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:00,930
[SPEAKER_03]: That baby fat she's gonna get after having the kid.

695
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:05,631
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's gonna get back into those tights and sign up for Tomb Raider 3.

696
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:09,373
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit surprising is Tomb Raider 2 didn't do super good.

697
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it did okay.

698
00:45:10,513 --> 00:45:11,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't do super good.

699
00:45:11,493 --> 00:45:14,094
[SPEAKER_02]: So, a little surprising, but it's happening.

700
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:17,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the sound of them jumping on the bandwagon.

701
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:21,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the franchise die, please.

702
00:45:22,015 --> 00:45:25,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was the sound of 14 and 15-year-old boys everywhere.

703
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:26,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Give the fans what we've been asking for.

704
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:30,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard R, Tomb Raider, lots of nudity.

705
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:31,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring it.

706
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:31,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.

707
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:33,640
[SPEAKER_02]: You already know she'll do topless.

708
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,241
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll do topless.

709
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:37,282
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll do full frontal, too.

710
00:45:37,522 --> 00:45:37,982
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

711
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:38,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Gia.

712
00:45:38,582 --> 00:45:40,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Gia.

713
00:45:40,543 --> 00:45:42,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Will she do full frontal after she's had the baby, though?

714
00:45:42,404 --> 00:45:43,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

715
00:45:43,845 --> 00:45:44,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you want to see that.

716
00:45:44,665 --> 00:45:45,325
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

717
00:45:45,345 --> 00:45:46,586
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why CG was invented.

718
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,289
[SPEAKER_02]: SioRam says let her die, she already died in one of her games.

719
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I think more than one game, to be honest.

720
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but in the whole game it consisted of flashbacks.

721
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:24,462
[SPEAKER_14]: At least from what I understand, I've never played that piece of crap.

722
00:46:24,802 --> 00:46:28,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Color of Sakura Sky, since when has a video game movie ever been good?

723
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:29,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill.

724
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:30,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill?

725
00:46:30,263 --> 00:46:33,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill was good, I wouldn't say it was great, but it was good.

726
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:43,046
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to ask me when has a video game movie ever been great, I'll probably say, I'll have to really rack my brain on that one if I can even think of one, but Silent Hill was good, I just don't know about, you know, great.

727
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:44,504
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

728
00:46:46,505 --> 00:46:46,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

729
00:46:48,786 --> 00:46:49,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

730
00:46:49,566 --> 00:46:49,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

731
00:46:50,826 --> 00:46:54,788
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned earlier, one of the games coming to the Revolution is Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

732
00:46:55,328 --> 00:46:59,389
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, not only the Revolution, but pretty much every other system out there.

733
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:07,012
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things, though, if you did happen to pick up the May issue of Game Informer, you actually got to see some pictures of it.

734
00:47:07,192 --> 00:47:07,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks pretty cool.

735
00:47:08,232 --> 00:47:10,253
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got some of the characters they featured previously.

736
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:19,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America, Thor, Doctor Strange, and Ghost Rider, and Silver Surfer and Letra are going to be some of the playable characters.

737
00:47:19,826 --> 00:47:29,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, this game is going to kind of be very similar to the X-Men Legends franchise, except this time, of course, spanning a little bit beyond the X-Men series.

738
00:47:30,249 --> 00:47:31,689
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking Dungeon Crawler here?

739
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:33,550
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, basically.

740
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks pretty cool.

741
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,470
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of cel-shaded.

742
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:38,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

743
00:47:38,584 --> 00:47:40,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be very similar to the other games.

744
00:47:40,206 --> 00:47:43,030
[SPEAKER_02]: The other games were pretty good, so worth checking out.

745
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:43,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be at E3.

746
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see, one more thing.

747
00:47:48,321 --> 00:47:49,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this will be at E3.

748
00:47:49,462 --> 00:47:50,563
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems a little early for this.

749
00:47:50,623 --> 00:47:55,386
[SPEAKER_03]: But, LucasArts is developing a game based around Darth Vader.

750
00:47:56,066 --> 00:47:57,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, that should be interesting there.

751
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:00,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they're going to be, uh, let's see, uh, what's going on here?

752
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:02,090
[SPEAKER_03]: A Star Wars game.

753
00:48:02,951 --> 00:48:07,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they outlined a new storyline that delved deeper into Darth Vader's history.

754
00:48:07,294 --> 00:48:11,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe, uh, to explain a little bit about what happened in that gap there between 3 and 4.

755
00:48:12,497 --> 00:48:12,878
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

756
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:14,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Will there be a scene with... No!

757
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:14,979
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

758
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:21,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Press the A button to shout NO!

759
00:48:22,281 --> 00:48:23,122
[SPEAKER_14]: God, we're stupid.

760
00:48:23,242 --> 00:48:23,562
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

761
00:48:23,762 --> 00:48:26,824
[SPEAKER_14]: LucasArts just needs to make another Samamax game that I'll buy from him.

762
00:48:28,225 --> 00:48:30,186
[SPEAKER_03]: How about they go back to some of that old school PC stuff?

763
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,008
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Lume 2, bitch?

764
00:48:32,168 --> 00:48:34,529
[SPEAKER_03]: They're working on a new Indiana Jones game.

765
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

766
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, there's a new Indiana Jones movie, right?

767
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:37,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

768
00:48:37,772 --> 00:48:38,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.

769
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:39,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Indiana Jones again was pretty cool.

770
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:44,913
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to head on over to our Skype line where we are taking your calls.

00:49:09,472 --> 00:49:15,237

780
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:16,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to our first call.

781
00:49:17,158 --> 00:49:18,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

782
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:20,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey.

783
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:21,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, who's this?

784
00:49:21,982 --> 00:49:23,183
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Did You Lose a Sock.

785
00:49:23,383 --> 00:49:24,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Did You Lose a Sock.

786
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:27,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not lose a sock, but what are you calling in about tonight?

787
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:29,028
[SPEAKER_10]: About the...

788
00:49:30,046 --> 00:49:32,948
[SPEAKER_10]: The sequel to the greatest game ever was released this week.

789
00:49:55,990 --> 00:50:06,735
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys really haven't talked about it much on the show, and I think a lot of people don't really know anything about it, so if I could do a short little spiel about the game and my experience with it, if that's alright with you.

790
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,056
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the Mother series, go for it, show's all yours.

791
00:50:09,557 --> 00:50:18,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well, for people that don't know, Mother 3 is obviously the sequel to Mother 2, which is better known as Earthbound Outside of Japan.

792
00:50:18,561 --> 00:50:22,943
[SPEAKER_10]: That was an RPG for the Super NES, recently made famous by the

793
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:26,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Star, Ness, appearing in both Super Smash Bros.

794
00:50:27,434 --> 00:50:30,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Mother 3 was in development for about 8 years.

795
00:50:31,356 --> 00:50:33,918
[SPEAKER_10]: It was even cancelled once and then revived.

796
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:40,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Mother 3 was finally released on the 20th, 3 days ago in Japan on the Game Boy Advance.

797
00:50:41,983 --> 00:50:51,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to play a small portion of the game, but I really didn't want to spoil anything for me because I'm still praying that it's going to come out outside of Japan, which...

798
00:50:52,711 --> 00:50:58,113
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that's ever going to happen, but I'm just hoping they'll say something at E3.

799
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:11,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Fans of the original won't be disappointed because Mother 3 and Mother 2 Earthbound are connected to each other as much as two Final Fantasy games.

800
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,181
[SPEAKER_10]: So new characters, a new world, but a lot of familiar stuff.

801
00:51:17,602 --> 00:51:20,544
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm not surprised about this because Mother 1 was...

802
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:24,571
[SPEAKER_10]: not connected to Mother 2 at all.

803
00:51:25,712 --> 00:51:32,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably the most interesting thing about Mother 3 was the beat rhythm.

804
00:51:33,259 --> 00:51:42,967
[SPEAKER_10]: The most important thing about Mother 3 and a lot of you beat rhythm game enthusiasts would like is the battle system.

805
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:46,409
[SPEAKER_10]: It has this weird music combo thing where

806
00:51:48,379 --> 00:51:57,884
[SPEAKER_10]: The battle system is really music-oriented, so each character has a musical... They don't attack with a musical instrument, but it makes a musical instrument sound.

807
00:52:00,806 --> 00:52:04,147
[SPEAKER_10]: When the main character attacks, it sounds like a saxophone.

808
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:12,031
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you actually attack on the beat of the battle music, you get a music combo.

809
00:52:12,051 --> 00:52:13,412
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's no visuals, there's...

810
00:52:14,238 --> 00:52:15,959
[SPEAKER_10]: to make you aware of this.

811
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:21,182
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all audio, so you kind of got to tap along with the music or something.

812
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:22,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how to explain it.

813
00:52:22,883 --> 00:52:24,204
[SPEAKER_10]: I only got to play it for a little bit.

814
00:52:24,564 --> 00:52:26,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to have to check it out at some point.

815
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:33,210
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know some folks in chat room are plugging this website, www.starmen.net, which I know is a huge Earthbound community.

816
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say we used to have a bunch of them that used to listen to this show a while back.

817
00:52:36,592 --> 00:52:36,872
[SPEAKER_03]: We did.

818
00:52:36,912 --> 00:52:38,013
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell happened to them?

819
00:52:38,493 --> 00:52:39,414
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even remember.

820
00:52:39,594 --> 00:52:42,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, see if I support their crappy game if they're going to abandon us.

821
00:52:42,516 --> 00:52:42,936
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

822
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:44,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Earthbound.

823
00:52:44,197 --> 00:52:45,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing's going to change that.

824
00:52:45,137 --> 00:52:48,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, Starman.net had a long-standing petition to bring Mother 3 into the U.S.

825
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm sure there's petitions out there, right?

826
00:52:51,822 --> 00:52:53,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I signed that petition a long time ago.

827
00:52:55,044 --> 00:53:05,110
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a huge member of Starman.net, and if anybody wants to know anything about any of the Mother games, just check it out, Starman.net.

828
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell those kids at Starman.net to come back.

829
00:53:07,191 --> 00:53:07,592
[SPEAKER_03]: We miss them.

830
00:53:08,842 --> 00:53:12,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well thank you for reminding us about Mother 3.

831
00:53:12,846 --> 00:53:15,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I should be slapped in the face for forgetting about that.

832
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:17,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

833
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:18,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, have a good one.

834
00:53:18,752 --> 00:53:19,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

835
00:53:21,014 --> 00:53:21,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew, get away.

836
00:53:21,594 --> 00:53:22,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mean that literally.

837
00:53:22,955 --> 00:53:24,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't slap me in the face literally.

838
00:53:24,697 --> 00:53:25,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another call.

839
00:53:25,598 --> 00:53:26,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

840
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Sky.

841
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:30,282
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Raven's Dolphin.

842
00:53:30,382 --> 00:53:31,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Raven's Dolphin.

843
00:53:31,403 --> 00:53:32,064
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

844
00:53:34,338 --> 00:53:34,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing much.

845
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:36,279
[SPEAKER_11]: My PSP died.

846
00:53:36,419 --> 00:53:37,020
[SPEAKER_11]: I dropped it.

847
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that'll happen if you drop expensive equipment.

848
00:53:40,222 --> 00:53:41,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It may not work anymore.

849
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:41,782
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?

850
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:46,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the dog knocked it off my TV.

851
00:53:47,586 --> 00:53:49,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to make the dog get a job to pay for it?

852
00:53:51,668 --> 00:53:54,430
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I got a warranty for it, so I'll get a new one.

853
00:53:55,115 --> 00:53:59,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you got one of those comparable warranty plans?

854
00:53:59,818 --> 00:54:00,799
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.

855
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I never buy that shit, but then again, I don't have a dog.

856
00:54:07,724 --> 00:54:08,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know.

857
00:54:09,185 --> 00:54:11,646
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I was in Mac Hell for the last week or so.

858
00:54:13,267 --> 00:54:15,709
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been playing on your PSP lately before it got broke?

859
00:54:18,271 --> 00:54:18,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Dexter.

860
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:18,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Dexter.

861
00:54:19,892 --> 00:54:25,436
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw in chatroom wants to know, the question is, what the fuck was the PSP doing on top of the TV?

862
00:54:25,756 --> 00:54:26,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.

863
00:54:27,678 --> 00:54:28,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea.

864
00:54:28,618 --> 00:54:30,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean your room, you messy son of a bitch.

865
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean it.

866
00:54:33,662 --> 00:54:34,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll clean it more.

867
00:54:34,863 --> 00:54:35,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I appreciate it.

868
00:54:36,084 --> 00:54:37,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And punish the dog.

869
00:54:37,745 --> 00:54:38,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame on the dog for doing that.

870
00:54:40,547 --> 00:54:40,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.

871
00:54:40,947 --> 00:54:41,828
[SPEAKER_03]: No food for a week.

872
00:54:41,928 --> 00:54:42,829
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

873
00:54:42,869 --> 00:54:43,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that.

874
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:44,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm totally kidding.

875
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:48,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Your dog meant well, but dogs do that sometimes.

876
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I say one more thing?

877
00:54:49,941 --> 00:54:50,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.

878
00:54:52,942 --> 00:54:55,164
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have a DS, so I do love that too.

879
00:54:55,504 --> 00:54:55,824
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

880
00:54:55,904 --> 00:54:56,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's good to know.

881
00:54:57,665 --> 00:54:59,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my PSP and my DS.

882
00:55:00,087 --> 00:55:08,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I do games on the DS, and I do my PSP for everything else, like websites and emulators and things like that.

883
00:55:09,632 --> 00:55:10,072
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good time.

884
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:12,033
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like my PSP more.

885
00:55:12,494 --> 00:55:13,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's just fine.

886
00:55:13,794 --> 00:55:14,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Luminous is a great game.

887
00:55:16,016 --> 00:55:16,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you that.

888
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:18,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Still is, years later.

889
00:55:18,996 --> 00:55:20,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Weren't they doing a sequel to Luminous?

890
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:22,884
[SPEAKER_11]: I would never have met Orange Lounge if it wasn't for my PSP.

891
00:55:23,264 --> 00:55:25,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Luminous 2 on PS2 and PSP.

892
00:55:25,649 --> 00:55:27,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of olrpsp.com?

893
00:55:29,935 --> 00:55:30,975
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

894
00:55:53,905 --> 00:55:57,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Download the new one if you haven't yet, and that way you'll fit on your 32-meg card a lot better.

895
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:01,030
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait to see Loki drunk in DDR.

896
00:56:02,731 --> 00:56:07,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're going to get him drunk again at E3 just for the purpose of recording hilarious videos.

897
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:10,415
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that'll be at the E3 Outpost, everybody.

898
00:56:10,676 --> 00:56:11,496
[SPEAKER_03]: E3Outpost.com.

899
00:56:11,516 --> 00:56:12,537
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be there live in person.

900
00:56:13,217 --> 00:56:16,059
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Raven's Dolphin, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, okay?

901
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for talking to me.

902
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:17,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

903
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:17,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.

904
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

905
00:56:19,241 --> 00:56:20,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to this call.

906
00:56:20,882 --> 00:56:22,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

907
00:56:22,163 --> 00:56:22,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

908
00:56:24,738 --> 00:56:25,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

909
00:56:25,158 --> 00:56:25,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, can you hear me?

910
00:56:26,058 --> 00:56:26,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I can.

911
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:27,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is this?

912
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:30,340
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Nintendo Maniac 64.

913
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,300
[SPEAKER_03]: What is on your mind, Nintendo Maniac 64?

914
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I've been trying to, wanting to tell Loki this one thing that's just driving me nuts.

915
00:56:38,582 --> 00:56:39,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what?

916
00:56:40,162 --> 00:56:47,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it was a while back, maybe like three weeks ago, he was talking about how Full Auto didn't have deathmatch or something like that.

917
00:56:48,365 --> 00:56:48,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

918
00:56:50,123 --> 00:56:58,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and this was even longer ago, that I told him about Rush 2049, how it was another game with guns and cars and stuff like that.

919
00:56:59,145 --> 00:57:03,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently he didn't realize that I was talking about it had a deathmatch mode.

920
00:57:06,306 --> 00:57:06,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

921
00:57:08,267 --> 00:57:18,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and if you're looking for, like, a car shooter with, like, deathmatch things, like, you should, like, look into that, except it doesn't have online, but, uh,

922
00:57:19,113 --> 00:57:29,343
[SPEAKER_05]: It does have 4 player multiplayer, which is really cool, and you can get it on 5 systems, all 4 current gen ones, including Dreamcast.

923
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:41,595
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get it on GameCube, PS2, and Xbox in Midway or K-Charge 3, and you can even get it on the N64 if you have an old console for retro's sake.

924
00:57:42,332 --> 00:57:42,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

925
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:44,513
[SPEAKER_02]: You do that tomorrow, Loki.

926
00:57:44,533 --> 00:57:45,814
[SPEAKER_03]: You do it tomorrow.

927
00:57:46,014 --> 00:57:47,715
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your assignment for this week.

928
00:57:47,735 --> 00:57:48,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just wait for Twisted Metal.

929
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,976
[SPEAKER_02]: No wedding for you.

930
00:57:49,996 --> 00:57:50,436
[SPEAKER_02]: For PS3.

931
00:57:50,656 --> 00:57:51,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that'll be cool.

932
00:57:51,817 --> 00:57:54,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo Maniac, do you have to prove us wrong on anything else tonight?

933
00:57:56,819 --> 00:57:58,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'm curious about this.

934
00:57:59,821 --> 00:58:00,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

935
00:58:01,462 --> 00:58:02,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I just said Loki.

936
00:58:02,222 --> 00:58:02,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I meant Sky.

937
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:03,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hooray.

938
00:58:03,843 --> 00:58:04,043
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

939
00:58:05,984 --> 00:58:06,484
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a 360, correct?

940
00:58:06,504 --> 00:58:06,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

941
00:58:09,144 --> 00:58:10,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a core or a premium?

942
00:58:11,085 --> 00:58:26,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought a core, but I bought the hard drive separate because I bought it when they were still going crazy about Xbox 360s and they were so hard to find that I just allowed myself to get raped financially and I bought a core and bought the hard drive separately because the core was all I could get at Best Buy.

943
00:58:26,989 --> 00:58:27,709
[SPEAKER_03]: They were out of premiums.

944
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so does this mean you have corded controllers?

945
00:58:31,911 --> 00:58:33,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, all my controllers are corded.

946
00:58:34,231 --> 00:58:34,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

947
00:58:35,071 --> 00:58:36,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I have three corded controllers.

948
00:58:39,008 --> 00:58:43,911
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually... I said this earlier today.

949
00:58:45,872 --> 00:58:51,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know if it would even be possible to charge an Xbox 360 controller off a PSP?

950
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:53,978
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you can't.

951
00:58:54,038 --> 00:58:56,539
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to charge the corded ones at all.

952
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are just USB.

953
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,681
[SPEAKER_03]: They plug right in.

954
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

955
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:00,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant the wireless.

956
00:59:00,942 --> 00:59:01,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the wireless.

957
00:59:01,443 --> 00:59:02,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I don't use those.

958
00:59:02,303 --> 00:59:07,667
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you would not be able to because the PSP port does not put the right output for

959
00:59:08,246 --> 00:59:12,410
[SPEAKER_02]: USB, and besides, you'd have to have some sort of converter cable to do that anyway.

960
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:13,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, if you have the converter.

961
00:59:14,191 --> 00:59:15,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you want to do that anyways, though?

962
00:59:16,613 --> 00:59:17,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can!

963
00:59:17,714 --> 00:59:19,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do people install Linux on things?

964
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:20,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing.

965
00:59:20,216 --> 00:59:32,446
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have the... Just keep... If you're really that hard-pressed to charge the battery, just keep the damn battery case that it comes with and put two AA batteries in there.

966
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:33,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it'll work just the same.

967
00:59:34,228 --> 00:59:37,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you can find any other USB port and...

968
00:59:37,495 --> 00:59:41,657
[SPEAKER_02]: In your house, on your computer, on your PlayStation 2 or whatever, and charge your batteries that way.

969
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:48,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the thing is, if you're charged on the PSP, then you can basically still have a wireless controller.

970
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,561
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go all through your house with you.

971
00:59:54,483 --> 00:59:55,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

972
00:59:56,004 --> 00:59:57,544
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, it's not clicking for me.

973
00:59:57,584 --> 00:59:58,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why you want to do that.

974
00:59:59,545 --> 01:00:00,286
[SPEAKER_03]: But because you can't.

975
01:00:00,326 --> 01:00:00,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can't?

976
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:05,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, was that a question to me?

977
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, why would you want to do that?

978
01:00:09,775 --> 01:00:18,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then you can go the 11 feet into the kitchen that your Xbox 360 port's not going to let you go to.

979
01:00:18,385 --> 01:00:20,628
[SPEAKER_05]: But then the signal's not going to reach, so what good does it do?

980
01:00:22,116 --> 01:00:23,597
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to reach 11 feet.

981
01:00:23,857 --> 01:00:24,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it this way.

982
01:00:24,637 --> 01:00:27,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't play 11 feet away from their TV.

983
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:31,459
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just retarded first off because you're not going to be able to see your TV.

984
01:00:31,499 --> 01:00:32,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you're playing Final Fantasy XI.

985
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming they even wanted to do that.

986
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, my uncle's couch is like...

987
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:37,647
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

988
01:00:59,378 --> 01:01:02,079
[SPEAKER_02]: and then put it out the extra, you know, six feet or whatever.

989
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:04,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Those corded cables are long enough anyways.

990
01:01:04,979 --> 01:01:07,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really think you're going to need to go that far.

991
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:16,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted, I'm sure if you've had other, you know, console systems that work, you know, with wireless controllers, then you're going to have to be in the same situation anyways.

992
01:01:16,122 --> 01:01:25,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Just either sit closer to the TV or just wait for some time to, you know, freaking charge those things or buy a goddamn quick charge kit and do it in like a couple hours.

993
01:01:26,785 --> 01:01:27,005
[SPEAKER_02]: That's

994
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,267
[SPEAKER_02]: The best way to do it.

995
01:01:29,287 --> 01:01:29,708
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 feet away.

996
01:01:29,748 --> 01:01:30,651
[SPEAKER_02]: How big is the TV?

997
01:01:32,716 --> 01:01:34,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure, but it's pretty big.

998
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:37,302
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for the porn.

999
01:01:37,642 --> 01:01:39,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me put it this way.

1000
01:01:39,143 --> 01:01:43,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if Jamie's TV, and Jamie's TV is pretty huge, I wouldn't sit 15 feet away from that thing.

1001
01:01:44,226 --> 01:01:46,807
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got her couches right next to that TV, too.

1002
01:01:46,907 --> 01:01:48,008
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of space.

1003
01:01:48,048 --> 01:01:48,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way.

1004
01:01:48,849 --> 01:01:55,492
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm sitting in a movie theater, I'm not even probably sitting that much further than 15 feet away, and that's a pretty damn large screen.

1005
01:01:55,613 --> 01:01:59,095
[SPEAKER_02]: If it were anything smaller than that, I would not be sitting 15 feet away.

1006
01:01:59,235 --> 01:01:59,575
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1007
01:01:59,815 --> 01:02:05,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Too Much Anger, Nintendo Maniac, good luck with your quest to charge the 360 controller using all sorts of household devices.

1008
01:02:06,336 --> 01:02:07,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you luck, okay?

1009
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:07,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck with that.

1010
01:02:07,976 --> 01:02:08,717
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to work, though.

1011
01:02:09,077 --> 01:02:10,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

1012
01:02:11,017 --> 01:02:11,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Rush 2049.

1013
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:11,757
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1014
01:02:12,117 --> 01:02:12,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we got him for that.

1015
01:02:12,977 --> 01:02:13,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1016
01:02:17,698 --> 01:02:18,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I love our listeners.

1017
01:02:19,038 --> 01:02:19,338
[SPEAKER_03]: One more.

1018
01:02:19,418 --> 01:02:20,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1019
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:22,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1020
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:23,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1021
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:24,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, who's this?

1022
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:25,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?

1023
01:02:25,459 --> 01:02:26,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I can.

1024
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:26,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I can.

1025
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,640
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Zand from East Berlin.

1026
01:02:28,888 --> 01:02:30,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi Xander from East Berlin, what's on your mind?

1027
01:02:30,548 --> 01:02:34,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think East Berlin exists anymore, does it?

1028
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:37,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so, you really fucked that up, but that's alright, what's on your mind?

1029
01:02:42,212 --> 01:02:50,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you reported on this earlier or not, but did you hear what the Katamari guy said about the Revmote earlier this week?

1030
01:02:51,074 --> 01:02:56,336
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't report on it, so why don't you put on your OLR reporter hat and tell us about it.

1031
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hold on, I gotta search for it here.

1032
01:03:00,441 --> 01:03:03,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it might be under my, uh, homework.

1033
01:03:03,443 --> 01:03:06,565
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be under the shotgun shell, seeing as you're, uh, you know, in East Berlin.

1034
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,045
East side!

1035
01:03:08,386 --> 01:03:11,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1036
01:03:11,727 --> 01:03:12,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, okay.

1037
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:17,210
[SPEAKER_04]: So, basically, um, and I'll have the exact quote with me right here.

1038
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:27,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but basically he said, like, Nintendo's putting too much focus on the, more or less he said that Nintendo's putting too much focus on the, uh,

1039
01:03:27,898 --> 01:03:36,442
[SPEAKER_04]: controller, and he just didn't really understand what exactly they're trying to do with it, and was kind of criticizing their strategy with it, you know, in a way.

1040
01:03:38,302 --> 01:03:41,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, you know, I'd get the exact quote if I had it in front of me, but I don't.

1041
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:47,026
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically the Katamari guy called Iwata a big smelly douche, correct?

1042
01:03:48,327 --> 01:03:49,487
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not really.

1043
01:03:49,507 --> 01:03:50,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I interpret it.

1044
01:03:51,688 --> 01:03:53,149
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just how Joystick is reporting it.

1045
01:03:53,509 --> 01:03:53,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1046
01:03:55,773 --> 01:03:56,513
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

1047
01:03:57,694 --> 01:03:59,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this earth-changing news?

1048
01:03:59,714 --> 01:04:02,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Katamari was done anyway.

1049
01:04:05,075 --> 01:04:07,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think any of us expected it to be on the Revolution.

1050
01:04:08,055 --> 01:04:10,356
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but he could have done something new.

1051
01:04:10,736 --> 01:04:14,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would have been a good console if he did something new.

1052
01:04:15,437 --> 01:04:20,477
[SPEAKER_02]: He needs to go back to designing his playground equipment and leave the video game world.

1053
01:04:20,537 --> 01:04:23,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the Death Traps for Children playground equipment.

1054
01:04:23,538 --> 01:04:24,178
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

1055
01:04:24,974 --> 01:04:26,875
[SPEAKER_04]: The one with the razor blade at the bottom of the slide?

1056
01:04:26,975 --> 01:04:27,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1057
01:04:28,496 --> 01:04:33,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody should show him Saw right before he has to do his playground design.

1058
01:04:33,379 --> 01:04:34,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill, the playground.

1059
01:04:36,201 --> 01:04:36,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1060
01:04:36,942 --> 01:04:37,602
What the fuck?

1061
01:04:38,723 --> 01:04:40,404
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is that?

1062
01:04:40,984 --> 01:04:41,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, now.

1063
01:04:41,705 --> 01:04:43,386
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that during the show.

1064
01:04:43,506 --> 01:04:45,327
[SPEAKER_02]: No fapping while you're on the line.

1065
01:04:45,367 --> 01:04:45,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1066
01:04:45,747 --> 01:04:46,548
[SPEAKER_03]: That's disgusting.

1067
01:04:46,968 --> 01:04:48,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1068
01:04:51,451 --> 01:04:52,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Reject false icons.

1069
01:04:52,512 --> 01:04:53,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, thank you very much.

1070
01:04:53,612 --> 01:04:54,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.

1071
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:54,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

1072
01:04:56,872 --> 01:04:58,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddammit, Jamie's having an influence on America.

1073
01:04:59,814 --> 01:05:00,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear that?

1074
01:05:01,616 --> 01:05:02,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject false icons.

1075
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:05,699
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on.

1076
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry we didn't get to all the calls.

1077
01:05:08,721 --> 01:05:09,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Try again next week.

1078
01:05:10,062 --> 01:05:11,263
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also leave us voicemails.

1079
01:05:11,283 --> 01:05:14,005
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be playing voicemails later on.

1080
01:05:14,025 --> 01:05:14,725
[SPEAKER_03]: 916-226-9067.

1081
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:16,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, that's a toll call.

1082
01:05:17,127 --> 01:05:20,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can always leave us a message there on Orange Lounge Radio, our Skype name.

1083
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, any last-minute stories tonight?

1084
01:05:22,511 --> 01:05:22,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one.

1085
01:05:24,946 --> 01:05:28,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the next homebrew game coming to the PSP, you may ask?

1086
01:05:29,569 --> 01:05:31,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, StarCraft.

1087
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:33,232
[SPEAKER_02]: They're working on porting over StarCraft.

1088
01:05:33,532 --> 01:05:33,792
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1089
01:05:35,073 --> 01:05:39,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently, not much has been done so far, but it's still early.

1090
01:05:39,336 --> 01:05:52,044
[SPEAKER_02]: StarCraft PSP 1.2a has been released, and, well, not too much done yet, just doing some of the basic stuff, proof concept crap.

1091
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,846
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, that's something fun.

1092
01:05:56,266 --> 01:05:58,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's it?

1093
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:01,288
[SPEAKER_02]: You always have a ton of last minute stories, that's it?

1094
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:02,688
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been slow.

1095
01:06:02,728 --> 01:06:06,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been filtering through stuff I don't want to talk about because it's retarded.

1096
01:06:06,469 --> 01:06:09,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like hearing people's opinions on crap.

1097
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumors that we think is going to happen on E3.

1098
01:06:14,572 --> 01:06:15,973
[SPEAKER_02]: What we think is going to be coming out.

1099
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:16,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Yada, yada, yada.

1100
01:06:16,933 --> 01:06:18,814
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, completely obvious shit.

1101
01:06:19,214 --> 01:06:20,894
[SPEAKER_02]: The revolution will have games.

1102
01:06:20,934 --> 01:06:21,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, stuff like that.

1103
01:06:22,095 --> 01:06:25,916
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just... Are you getting a little bitter at the lack of news weeks before E3 here?

1104
01:06:26,156 --> 01:06:26,516
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

1105
01:06:26,536 --> 01:06:28,777
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been really slow.

1106
01:06:29,517 --> 01:06:29,818
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1107
01:06:30,618 --> 01:06:31,858
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've been really busy.

1108
01:06:31,878 --> 01:06:33,139
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1109
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:35,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get to tonight's last story, I have to do an apology.

1110
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:36,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So cue the sad music.

1111
01:06:38,206 --> 01:06:49,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for pronouncing your name wrong and horribly butchering it earlier, but this is why I will forever be on amateur internet radio.

1112
01:07:09,042 --> 01:07:12,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't mispronounce City by calling him Bukkake.

1113
01:07:38,018 --> 01:07:41,360
[SPEAKER_03]: GameLoft has teamed up with Paris Hilton Entertainment Inc.

1114
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:47,804
[SPEAKER_03]: to develop, publish, and distribute a line of cell phone games based on Paris Hilton.

1115
01:07:48,505 --> 01:07:52,087
[SPEAKER_03]: The bigger question we should be asking is why is there a Paris Hilton Entertainment Inc.?

1116
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:53,488
[SPEAKER_03]: That surprised me.

1117
01:07:54,009 --> 01:07:58,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Paris Hilton has a quote on this, the story originally coming from Kotaku, and they ran a quote here.

1118
01:07:58,472 --> 01:08:04,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, I'm excited to collaborate with GameLoft to bring the Paris Hilton brand and the glamour of young Hollywood.

1119
01:08:04,656 --> 01:08:06,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there's nothing glamorous about her.

1120
01:08:06,857 --> 01:08:09,618
[SPEAKER_03]: to the cell phones of all my fans around the world.

1121
01:08:10,198 --> 01:08:20,782
[SPEAKER_03]: My phone has become an all-in-one entertainment device and mobile... Sorry, because I can't help but think about that list that got leaked and all the topless photos of her on the phone.

1122
01:08:20,802 --> 01:08:21,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1123
01:08:22,745 --> 01:08:24,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a one-stop entertainment stop.

1124
01:08:25,407 --> 01:08:27,209
[SPEAKER_03]: And mobile games are an integral part of that.

1125
01:08:27,789 --> 01:08:31,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Mobile gaming is really hot right now, and I'm excited to be a part of this project.

1126
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:35,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's... She doesn't use the word integral.

1127
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:36,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Some publicist put that out.

1128
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Mobile games are an integral part of that.

1129
01:08:41,642 --> 01:08:43,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, she did not use that word.

1130
01:08:43,323 --> 01:08:47,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless there's a game that features a target over her, I ain't playing it.

1131
01:08:48,047 --> 01:08:48,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Integral, that...

1132
01:08:49,195 --> 01:08:51,275
[SPEAKER_02]: That right there is... That's a grown-up word.

1133
01:08:51,315 --> 01:08:53,476
[SPEAKER_02]: That's over her limit of syllables per word.

1134
01:08:55,116 --> 01:08:57,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, of course, that makes our chatroom go wild.

1135
01:08:57,997 --> 01:09:00,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Popanda21, I love the simple life.

1136
01:09:00,357 --> 01:09:01,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you lose a sock?

1137
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:01,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a slut.

1138
01:09:01,797 --> 01:09:02,197
[SPEAKER_03]: The game.

1139
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:03,478
[SPEAKER_03]: You will bow to me.

1140
01:09:03,558 --> 01:09:05,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter Jackson's One Night in Paris.

1141
01:09:06,978 --> 01:09:10,679
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual quote's probably like, talkie device, play game.

1142
01:09:11,559 --> 01:09:14,780
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Poo Eater, Paris Hilton the Whore, MMORPG.

1143
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:16,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd hit it.

1144
01:09:18,198 --> 01:09:18,979
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1145
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:24,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Paris Hilton, mobile phone gaming, these two shitty things deserve each other.

1146
01:09:25,906 --> 01:09:26,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly.

1147
01:09:26,427 --> 01:09:28,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to seeing it on the next N-Gage.

1148
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:31,172
[SPEAKER_03]: You bought an N-Gage, didn't you?

1149
01:09:35,949 --> 01:09:37,790
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the question we have to ask Paris Hilton.

1150
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:43,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think Paris Hilton will be at E3?

1151
01:09:44,032 --> 01:09:45,792
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we could ask her?

1152
01:09:46,092 --> 01:09:46,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

1153
01:09:47,613 --> 01:09:49,894
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to somehow make that happen.

1154
01:09:50,094 --> 01:09:51,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a lot I want to ask her.

1155
01:09:51,774 --> 01:09:54,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And only a couple of it has to do with video games.

1156
01:09:54,955 --> 01:09:56,576
[SPEAKER_13]: But I know you want to hear it anyway, come on.

1157
01:09:57,436 --> 01:10:00,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder who's going to be at the Nintendo thing.

1158
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:01,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

1159
01:10:01,968 --> 01:10:03,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this was at the Paramount, I think.

1160
01:10:26,232 --> 01:10:26,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1161
01:10:26,692 --> 01:10:26,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

1162
01:10:27,213 --> 01:10:28,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever the hell that is.

1163
01:10:28,233 --> 01:10:28,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, forget it.

1164
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, DJ PooEater says, here's the question I could ask her.

1165
01:10:33,276 --> 01:10:36,818
[SPEAKER_03]: What the shit are you doing at E3, you smelly dog-carrying poo-face?

1166
01:10:37,578 --> 01:10:38,659
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what I'd ask.

1167
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:40,160
[SPEAKER_03]: What the shit?

1168
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,081
[SPEAKER_02]: We might... Eloquent.

1169
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:45,503
[SPEAKER_02]: We might ask the same of Sinbad as well.

1170
01:10:47,264 --> 01:10:48,304
[SPEAKER_03]: What the shit are you doing at E3?

1171
01:10:50,376 --> 01:10:51,136
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great question.

1172
01:10:51,156 --> 01:10:52,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have user-submitted questions.

1173
01:10:52,657 --> 01:10:53,178
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we'll do.

1174
01:10:53,278 --> 01:10:58,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to the show Wednesday, and we'll tell you what celebrities are at E3, and if we can run into them Thursday, we'll ask them questions.

1175
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we can guarantee these two.

1176
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:01,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Sinbad, because he's there every year.

1177
01:11:02,282 --> 01:11:02,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

1178
01:11:03,703 --> 01:11:06,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gary Coleman usually is there in some form.

1179
01:11:07,345 --> 01:11:09,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, user-submitted questions.

1180
01:11:09,046 --> 01:11:11,447
[SPEAKER_14]: We are guaranteed your ass is kicked out of E3.

1181
01:11:12,088 --> 01:11:13,669
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we won't ask any of them until Friday.

1182
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:16,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Good plan.

1183
01:11:17,751 --> 01:11:18,071
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1184
01:11:19,824 --> 01:11:20,244
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1185
01:11:20,304 --> 01:11:20,905
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the show.

1186
01:11:22,106 --> 01:11:23,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1187
01:11:24,168 --> 01:11:25,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew, thank you so much for being here.

1188
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:26,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Long time no see.

1189
01:11:26,871 --> 01:11:27,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be a stranger.

1190
01:11:27,972 --> 01:11:28,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1191
01:11:28,332 --> 01:11:29,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Your final thought, please.

1192
01:11:29,513 --> 01:11:30,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Toasters for life.

1193
01:11:31,115 --> 01:11:32,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought.

1194
01:11:33,077 --> 01:11:34,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I have so much work to do.

1195
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:39,282
[SPEAKER_03]: And my final thought is, please, won't anybody think of the children?

1196
01:11:40,544 --> 01:11:40,884
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1197
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:42,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great night.

1198
01:11:42,463 --> 01:11:45,484
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, please do us a big favor.

1199
01:11:45,825 --> 01:11:50,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell somebody about us because that is how we spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio.

1200
01:11:50,386 --> 01:11:54,608
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just some no-name little indie site doing a show here we've been doing for almost four years now.

1201
01:11:54,908 --> 01:11:56,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all word of mouth, baby.

1202
01:11:56,288 --> 01:12:02,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you could just tell somebody you love or tell somebody you hate about our show and get them to listen, that's all the payment we need.

1203
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:02,850
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.

1204
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:07,012
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, until we sell out, which should be happening pretty soon.

1205
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:09,213
[SPEAKER_03]: And spread that video like wildfire.

1206
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:10,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1207
01:12:11,798 --> 01:12:12,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

1208
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:15,460
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
