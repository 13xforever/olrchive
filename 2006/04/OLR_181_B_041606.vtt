00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 181 for this April the 16th of 2006.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.920
Pretty exciting first half there. Lots of news from some

00:30.920 --> 00:35.280
no-name site you've probably never heard of before and some other fun stuff in there too.

00:35.280 --> 00:39.240
Kingdom Hearts 2, Metroid Prime 3, all that good stuff. But now

00:39.240 --> 00:43.180
we're gonna start off this half of the show first by saying hello to Spike

00:43.180 --> 00:46.800
who's joining us for this half of the show. Whoa. Deja-fu.

00:46.800 --> 00:51.680
Hey! How you doing? Doing pretty good. Weren't you just here a week ago and then

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
like two weeks before that?

00:52.680 --> 00:56.080
You're becoming quite the little regular on our program. It's awesome.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.040
You guys are so cool.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.200
Oh, but you're cool, Spike. That's why we like having you on the show.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.720
Well, thank you. First off, tell us how your gaming week was. What'd you play this week?

01:04.720 --> 01:07.960
This week I spent some more time with the first Kingdom Hearts, finishing it up

01:07.960 --> 01:11.520
so I can start the second one, which I've finally acquired.

01:11.520 --> 01:14.240
Spent a little bit of time with Final Fantasy XI.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.240
Same old as it's been the last few weeks now.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.520
Very cool.

01:18.520 --> 01:22.400
Uh, you also brought some games for me to play, but I haven't gotten a chance to play

01:22.400 --> 01:25.100
them yet. What did you bring for me to play?

01:25.100 --> 01:27.120
uh... gosh i brought

01:27.120 --> 01:30.060
the gameboy advance version of space channel five

01:30.060 --> 01:34.040
which just sounds god-awful in concept but we'll see

01:34.040 --> 01:38.340
it's it's simon says committees what can be said about that okay

01:38.340 --> 01:41.700
uh... i brought along the britain of course for the p s one it's a classic

01:41.700 --> 01:43.960
that i've seen before but it is a classic

01:43.960 --> 01:46.140
yeah it's it's a pretty common one but

01:46.140 --> 01:48.060
on the off chance uh...

01:48.060 --> 01:51.460
the main one that i was excited to bring to you was primal image which we talked

01:51.460 --> 01:55.360
about last week. That's right, Primal Image was the Pokemon Snap with super models, right?

01:55.360 --> 02:00.080
Oh yeah, except I played it again, I mean they don't really look like super models.

02:00.080 --> 02:08.600
Just people. Super market models. Super whores. Yes. Alright. Sounds awesome. Alright, one

02:08.600 --> 02:12.880
system that is getting a lot of attention lately with all the things you can do with

02:12.880 --> 02:18.520
it is the Nintendo DS, and we thought we'd start this segment of the show off with some

02:18.520 --> 02:22.720
hacking news. Loki, what's going on with Nintendo DS, hack-wise?

02:22.720 --> 02:27.720
Well, hack-wise, you know, they've done some really cool things like

02:27.720 --> 02:31.400
at E3 last year they have this thing called the DS Download Station

02:31.400 --> 02:35.960
and you can actually download, you know, demos of games

02:35.960 --> 02:40.680
to your DS and these have actually started to roll out into stores now

02:40.680 --> 02:46.600
and, you know, you might see them at a local Best Buy or

02:46.600 --> 02:52.000
You know, that type of thing. The only thing is, if you don't have one nearby, what are

02:52.000 --> 03:00.000
you to do? What are you to do? Well, build your own. That's right. Actually, plans were

03:00.000 --> 03:05.880
put up on the internet on how to build your own DS station. And they have the files out

03:05.880 --> 03:11.080
there to do it and a whole tutorial. It's pretty simple. You just basically need to

03:11.080 --> 03:18.640
get an RT2500 based Wi-Fi card in your computer, or sometimes your laptop will have one too

03:18.640 --> 03:27.320
because you can do the PCMI card, and can I do it on my Apple? You might be able to,

03:27.320 --> 03:33.080
I'm not sure. I'll have to try it. I'm not sure. But they have a whole list of stuff

03:33.080 --> 03:38.320
that's available to basically do this. And all the demos that they have on here, which

03:38.320 --> 03:42.340
I'm sure I don't know how they got the demos off the demo station, but they're all the

03:42.340 --> 03:46.760
ones that are currently out there now, brain training and all that fun stuff, so if you

03:46.760 --> 03:50.560
really want to do it, I wanted to get this done on my laptop so we could actually do

03:50.560 --> 03:53.280
it in the studio, maybe for next week, but uh...

03:53.280 --> 03:56.520
Isn't it just a matter of time before they figure out a way to beam the games over, not

03:56.520 --> 03:58.800
just the demo, but possibly the whole freaking games?

03:58.800 --> 04:01.760
I'm not sure if they can store that much on there.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.040
Ah, okay.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.920
But still, it's interesting.

04:05.920 --> 04:11.080
And apparently, though, if you do have a Game Boy Advance flash cart, you can record the

04:11.080 --> 04:16.020
games to that, and there's a way around where you can actually play them off of that, too.

04:16.020 --> 04:20.860
Nintendo's probably a little irked at this news, probably.

04:20.860 --> 04:24.360
For those folks who maybe live in a remote part, I think what would be very interesting

04:24.360 --> 04:26.740
is using this in other countries.

04:26.740 --> 04:31.140
I think some folks who are in other countries, like Japan, the UK, who might not be seeing

04:31.140 --> 04:34.860
these games for a little while otherwise and even the demos can play these long

04:34.860 --> 04:38.700
before they're released in those in that well not Japan so much maybe the UK

04:38.700 --> 04:42.460
released in that country yeah I think that's pretty cool or the other thing is

04:42.460 --> 04:46.000
maybe modified to put homebrew on there to play homebrew games that you can

04:46.000 --> 04:51.360
transfer via Wi-Fi without having to have all this fancy stuff that might be

04:51.360 --> 04:54.840
an idea comment from our chat room over at orangelanatrader.com click on chat

04:54.840 --> 05:00.160
gamerdude1212 says Nintendo hates all this piracy stuff I don't doubt it

05:00.160 --> 05:04.200
I don't doubt it at all, I'm sure they do. Most companies do hate it.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.680
So, it's probably not going to be an issue later because think about it

05:07.680 --> 05:11.560
the Virtual Console, the fact that the Revolution

05:11.560 --> 05:15.280
is going to have Wi-Fi, the fact that it's going to be able to hook up to the DS

05:15.280 --> 05:18.800
you'll probably be able to download these for free off of the DS

05:18.800 --> 05:22.840
or the Revolution anyways, so what's the big deal? How cool would that be anyway to

05:22.840 --> 05:26.120
you know go to Nintendo.com and download something that you can beam

05:26.120 --> 05:30.000
forget this whole store, why not bypass the kiosks in stores?

05:30.000 --> 05:33.180
and be able to download demos to your DS

05:33.180 --> 05:36.440
just like you can on Xbox Live, but you do it through your computer. I think they

05:36.440 --> 05:38.960
should be endorsing this stuff, not turning their back on it.

05:38.960 --> 05:43.000
But, yeah, whatever. What do I know?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.440
I do know this, Xbox Live is going to be doing another free week,

05:46.440 --> 05:50.840
but it's during the week of E3. This time it's not just, I don't think it's just

05:50.840 --> 05:54.200
one weekend. I think it's actually doing a whole week. No, I'm sorry, it is just one

05:54.200 --> 05:54.680
weekend.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.920
But the weekend that they're gonna be doing this is May 8th.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.980
no it is it is a full week because running through May 15th

06:00.980 --> 06:04.540
and it's going to be sponsored by

06:04.540 --> 06:09.820
well I'm not sure I thought I saw the name of the sponsor there

06:09.820 --> 06:13.440
I thought

06:13.440 --> 06:18.460
not FIFA, well FIFA World Cup Soccer 2006 might hit the marketplace during that

06:18.460 --> 06:19.320
same week

06:19.320 --> 06:22.520
it wasn't FIFA it was a shoe brand that was

06:22.520 --> 06:25.800
doing it I can't remember

06:25.800 --> 06:29.240
I'm trying to see if I can find it here. Adidas.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.120
Adidas, that's it. They're doing it. I knew I could find it, yay!

06:32.120 --> 06:36.280
Adidas all day I dream about.

06:36.280 --> 06:40.000
Sorry, I can't help, my mind just can't help but go there.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.880
Good idea, bad idea to do this during the week of E3.

06:43.880 --> 06:48.200
Because most of the hardcore gamers will be either at E3

06:48.200 --> 06:51.680
or glued to their computers reading updates on E3.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.680
So is this a smart thing to do?

06:54.680 --> 07:00.240
you know, announce a new game or something, and be like, Hey! Right now you can go play a demo

07:00.240 --> 07:04.440
on Xbox Live Arcade. That would be very cool. You think they would actually do that?

07:04.440 --> 07:08.080
Play the demos that they're playing at E3? Download them right now? No way.

07:08.080 --> 07:12.080
Why not? Because they just don't do that. Or maybe limited ones.

07:12.080 --> 07:16.240
Maybe, but what is is there anything so wrong with putting those demos out there

07:16.240 --> 07:18.000
on Xbox Live for everybody to play?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.640
Is it just because the games are usually half finished or what? There is actually one

07:21.640 --> 07:22.360
out on

07:22.360 --> 07:26.260
Xbox Live now the Tomb Raider one right well there's doing there's they have

07:26.260 --> 07:32.080
several of those things I think it would be a good idea but not like have it be

07:32.080 --> 07:37.180
like a specific download like you have a certain amount of points you can

07:37.180 --> 07:42.160
download it something like that I mean how cool would that be that this is the

07:42.160 --> 07:46.600
closest you can get to e3 you know right here you live and play the same demo

07:46.600 --> 07:49.600
they're all playing at e3 right now I think they'll be great publicity stunt

07:49.600 --> 07:55.540
Especially since, bless their hearts, they decided to not give everybody who works for

07:55.540 --> 07:58.460
anyone who sells video games passes.

07:58.460 --> 08:04.660
So it is going to reduce the amount of people who are going to be able to go to E3.

08:04.660 --> 08:08.140
Somehow this no-name site got in, though, which is amazing.

08:08.140 --> 08:09.140
We actually report.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.140
I know.

08:10.140 --> 08:12.500
We're a legitimate business, believe it or not.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.300
We don't work in the garden section at Walmart.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.300
Exactly.

08:16.300 --> 08:20.940
One thing that I could see turning a lot of prospective developers away from that, though,

08:20.940 --> 08:25.400
is that the average E3 demo is nowhere near as polished as a demo you might get on a demo

08:25.400 --> 08:26.400
disk.

08:26.400 --> 08:31.940
And a lot of people who are casually downloading off the marketplace might be using this as,

08:31.940 --> 08:35.440
you know, is this my final decision on purchasing this game?

08:35.440 --> 08:37.580
And that would definitely scare a lot of people away.

08:37.580 --> 08:40.100
You play a demo of an unfinished game.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.360
It's not very good.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.540
You don't come back to it six months later when it's really ready to be played.

08:44.540 --> 08:48.160
I guess that's a very good point and it makes me think about, you know, the Tomb Raider.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.340
I completely judge my opinion of the Tomb Raider game based on the demo, there's no

08:51.340 --> 08:54.460
way in hell I'm buying the game, I didn't enjoy the demo at all.

08:54.460 --> 08:57.140
That's just my personal opinion, I understand a lot of people are liking the game, but I

08:57.140 --> 08:59.740
found it to be really frickin' boring.

08:59.740 --> 09:03.820
But I guess you're right, but I think about some of the really creative E3 demos I've

09:03.820 --> 09:07.300
seen, like remember the Weheart Katamari demo last year?

09:07.300 --> 09:11.620
It was specifically made for E3, and like the king would be talking about E3.

09:11.620 --> 09:13.620
It was great, who wouldn't want to play that?

09:13.620 --> 09:18.220
I mean, it was awesome. But I do get that point of the half-finished demos.

09:18.220 --> 09:22.640
You make an even better point, though. Maybe developers should be making

09:22.640 --> 09:25.820
specific demos to be downloaded for this free weekend

09:25.820 --> 09:28.820
that would target them and make them feel like they're a part of something.

09:28.820 --> 09:31.140
I think a lot of gamers would really go for,

09:31.140 --> 09:34.100
oh, this developer is targeting me. I want to play this.

09:34.100 --> 09:39.340
You know what? We need to start an Xbox development company. Right now.

09:39.340 --> 09:43.020
I have a better idea. Green Lounge Gaming. How about this?

09:43.020 --> 09:43.520
What?

09:43.520 --> 09:46.740
How about we sell 360 games with hamburgers?

09:46.740 --> 09:48.300
Ah, I love this idea.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.420
I love this idea.

09:50.420 --> 09:51.340
Can any of us cook?

09:51.340 --> 09:52.100
Oh, how about this?

09:52.100 --> 09:52.860
No, I got it.

09:52.860 --> 09:53.620
Excuse me.

09:53.620 --> 09:58.300
Xbox Live with Super Bacon.

09:58.300 --> 10:01.660
OK, my stomach is just turned really awfully now.

10:01.660 --> 10:03.700
I feel nauseous.

10:03.700 --> 10:06.580
I feel nauseous too, but now I want Super Bacon.

10:06.580 --> 10:09.100
All right, anyway, moving on.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.660
One Xbox Live, or one Xbox title, I should say,

10:11.660 --> 10:15.440
general has been turning heads is oblivion right low-key oblivion has

10:15.440 --> 10:21.380
been turning heads and it's been selling and selling and selling I want to say

10:21.380 --> 10:28.320
2.5 million that's a lot of copies a lot of copies no I think selling these nude

10:28.320 --> 10:35.180
patch oh yeah is that all there is to say it's just sold a lot no not at all

10:35.180 --> 10:40.580
I'm just bullshitting no no basically you know it's got a really good score

10:40.580 --> 10:42.580
I don't know a lot of magazines that reviewed it

10:43.140 --> 10:49.540
They've sold over 100 or 1.7 million units of oblivion for the PC and the 360

10:50.300 --> 10:52.300
since they've shipped

10:52.300 --> 10:54.140
from watch and

10:54.140 --> 11:00.940
Just you know, it's been on the covers of magazines. It's just really good. It's basically it's ended world hunger

11:01.380 --> 11:05.700
It's basically accounted for it found Osama bin Laden. It's amazing

11:05.700 --> 11:12.440
It was it accounted for 13% of all PC game sales in the first week since it was released and by the way the other

11:13.140 --> 11:15.340
87% was World of Warcraft amazingly

11:15.980 --> 11:17.980
Go figure

11:18.940 --> 11:23.880
You know what I want to know what where the hell is my free feel, I don't know

11:24.420 --> 11:25.500
I

11:25.500 --> 11:30.700
Like comments in our chairman see now now they're taking this orange launch radio pack in games concept really far

11:30.700 --> 11:35.100
And I like this concept idea from Jeremy Todd one push-button receive bacon

11:35.620 --> 11:40.260
That's a great game concept. Hey Jeremy Todd. You know how to program games. We need to get them on our staff

11:40.260 --> 11:42.500
Can you program I think you know?

11:42.500 --> 11:48.740
I think we should do all of our games in Commodore 64 basic because I know how to program in Commodore 64 basic

11:48.740 --> 11:52.060
Is there a way we spikes doing this you me you yep?

11:52.060 --> 11:58.540
Let's program some games in Commodore 64 basic and somehow find somebody to port them to the Xbox 360

11:58.540 --> 12:01.940
I'll be awesome.

12:01.940 --> 12:06.960
You have banana, throw YN question mark.

12:06.960 --> 12:11.080
You have bacon, eat YN.

12:11.080 --> 12:15.880
Syntax error, ready.

12:15.880 --> 12:23.160
Speaking of Xbox Live, Saints Row is going to be having a very large demo going to the

12:23.160 --> 12:25.280
Xbox Live Marketplace.

12:25.280 --> 12:28.660
The game is going to be released the third quarter of this year.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.640
Saints Row, though, we don't know much about multiplayer in this game.

12:31.640 --> 12:35.860
There are going to be some multiplayer modes and multiplayer maps.

12:35.860 --> 12:38.580
Basically it's kind of like Grand Theft Auto.

12:38.580 --> 12:40.820
I don't know, you get the same impression for this game, Loki?

12:40.820 --> 12:41.820
The Saints Row?

12:41.820 --> 12:42.820
Yeah.

12:42.820 --> 12:43.820
It's kinda...

12:43.820 --> 12:47.940
It was supposed to be the Grand Theft Auto killer that never freaking came out.

12:47.940 --> 12:48.940
Gotcha.

12:48.940 --> 12:51.340
Well, it's on its way, and it's supposedly going to have multiplayer, so there's supposed

12:51.340 --> 12:54.460
to be a very large demo coming to Xbox Live.

12:54.460 --> 12:56.460
They just don't say when, just sometime before release.

12:56.460 --> 12:57.460
You know what I say?

12:57.460 --> 12:58.460
To hell with Satan's Row.

12:58.460 --> 13:00.640
It's all about Crackdown.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.640
Crackdown is going to be awesome.

13:01.640 --> 13:06.540
If you've gotten this month's official Xbox magazine, they have a trailer for Crackdown.

13:06.540 --> 13:11.900
It's like Grand Theft Auto with basically a super human as the lead in it, so you can

13:11.900 --> 13:13.400
throw cars at people.

13:13.400 --> 13:20.320
Nothing says, give me my money, bitch, than throwing a fucking car into your head.

13:20.320 --> 13:24.840
That takes me back to Nark.

13:24.840 --> 13:25.840
Very good.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.940
The chat room is still talking about this game thing.

13:28.940 --> 13:32.680
You know that we did have somebody make Orange Lounge Radio the game already.

13:32.680 --> 13:33.680
That was Illusion.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.520
One of our fans actually made that and it's in the forums.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.560
But now people want to take this to the next level.

13:37.560 --> 13:41.440
DJ Pooh Eater says that he knows the Flash programming.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.160
I know Dark Soccer knows that too.

13:43.160 --> 13:44.360
Maybe we could have them team up.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.560
I know how to do ads.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.560
Open up the programming.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.560
And I know how to do slideshows.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.120
Well, maybe you could do the art and you could do the programming.

13:50.120 --> 13:54.320
I'm halfway through my flash semester. You can make an awesome opening cinema.

13:54.320 --> 13:58.160
There you go. There you go. I love this idea.

13:58.160 --> 14:01.760
Can I do it for my homework? Sure.

14:01.760 --> 14:05.200
If I get school credit for it, okay. I'll allow it.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.000
Check that out on the forums. I think Illusion still has that up. I'm supposed to

14:09.000 --> 14:12.300
put it on our MySpace or our website as well though. I

14:12.300 --> 14:15.580
totally forgot. I forgot to send them a private message saying we can move it and

14:15.580 --> 14:17.000
suck our home bandwidth away.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.840
uh... they get it it's it's fabulous it's a text adventure

14:20.840 --> 14:22.600
it's the most fun you'll ever have

14:22.600 --> 14:26.960
playing orange lawns radio the game you had me at text adventure

14:26.960 --> 14:30.400
i'm invincible

14:30.400 --> 14:34.920
every time i type in an attack nothing will happen SPOILER

14:34.920 --> 14:39.480
oh my god spoilers i can't believe you ruined the orange lawns radio

14:39.480 --> 14:44.240
game for everybody i didn't say what happened i just said i'm invincible

14:44.240 --> 14:46.780
and you know what happens on page two ninety

14:46.780 --> 14:49.620
Jamie kills Dumbledore, it's amazing!

14:49.620 --> 14:51.720
That's not a spoiler!

14:51.720 --> 14:54.680
I didn't say what happens in the game, I just said I'm invincible.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.860
Alright, Aerith died.

14:56.860 --> 14:58.620
And I cheered!

14:58.620 --> 15:03.640
I still have my memory card saved. Okay, you've told this story five times on the show.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.160
More than that,

15:05.160 --> 15:10.100
but I still think... It's like one of her crowning moments. It's something I'm very proud of.

15:10.100 --> 15:15.080
I still have my file. You should sell that card on eBay, that memory card. Hell no!

15:15.080 --> 15:21.720
Jamie saved game at dead era no no this memory card is special I buy it it's my first memory

15:21.720 --> 15:28.980
card I ever had it's an off-brand one it has a tech it has a Sakura sticker on it and it

15:28.980 --> 15:37.260
has all of my old Tekken 3 save files and bust to move so yeah that's that memory card

15:37.260 --> 15:44.260
is special to me. Oh, and my Symphony of the Night files with 210%. Dork. Alright. Dark

15:45.360 --> 15:49.020
Sakura likes to travel the world from her computer because she has buddies over in the

15:49.020 --> 15:53.220
UK and she doesn't want them to feel left out. So she serves some of the UK news sites

15:53.220 --> 15:57.380
to find out what's going on in gaming in the UK. What's going on in gaming. But of course,

15:57.380 --> 16:01.260
you know, what goes on over there often affects what happens over here so we don't like to

16:01.260 --> 16:05.920
think of it as necessarily UK only news it's just news from the UK nice

16:05.920 --> 16:11.200
disclaimer you're welcome I find out you have to use them quite frequently with

16:11.200 --> 16:14.640
you hey what's that supposed to mean nothing

16:14.640 --> 16:20.360
heart yeah yeah yeah you need to just be nice to me because I hurt heart don't

16:20.360 --> 16:24.280
make heart signs at me that's not gonna make me it's the olr gang sign a little

16:24.280 --> 16:28.680
heart I think this should be the official olr gang sign make a heart with

16:28.680 --> 16:32.540
your hands. If you don't know how to do it, we'll take a picture. You're retarded then.

16:32.540 --> 16:35.820
There is a pic- SHUT UP! There is a picture of you.

16:35.820 --> 16:39.300
Doing that? Doing hearts. Sweet. From the club. Sweet.

16:39.300 --> 16:42.700
I'll put it up online. Alright, anyway, you can't use- You also look really silly in that picture too.

16:42.700 --> 16:46.260
You can't use- No. I'm gonna do Brazil news now.

16:46.260 --> 16:49.140
No. Um, I-

16:49.140 --> 16:53.020
It's a Polish developer called, uh, Nebris, I guess is how it's pronounced.

16:53.020 --> 16:56.460
They're working on a film noir inspired game for the revolution

16:56.460 --> 17:01.580
called Sadness, which I automatically want to play it because it's very emo and goth.

17:01.580 --> 17:07.220
But they are basing it off of movies like Sin City,

17:07.220 --> 17:10.660
and they're saying the whole game is going to be done in black and white.

17:10.660 --> 17:15.420
It's set before World War, we don't get any of the

17:15.420 --> 17:19.140
depression, prohibition stuff, but you

17:19.140 --> 17:22.420
get to complain about different things.

17:22.420 --> 17:23.620
Sin City the game what?

17:23.620 --> 17:26.900
It's based off of movies like Sin City.

17:26.900 --> 17:32.980
Do we get chicks with guns? Because that was the best part of Sin City was chicks with guns.

17:32.980 --> 17:36.340
Well seeing as how this is pre World War era

17:36.340 --> 17:40.460
I don't think that's going to be very likely.

17:40.460 --> 17:44.660
How about chicks with sword? There was a chick with a sword that was pretty hot in that movie.

17:44.660 --> 17:48.260
I haven't seen Sin City. Spoiler!

17:48.260 --> 17:51.540
You haven't seen Sin City. What is your problem?

17:51.540 --> 17:55.100
need to go out right away and see this movie. I have something called a life

17:55.100 --> 17:58.900
and I've had the movie since it came out on DVD. I feel Sin City was slightly overrated

17:58.900 --> 18:01.300
but it's it's worth seeing. It's worth your time

18:01.300 --> 18:05.140
on a rainy day. I have this thing that's called life

18:05.140 --> 18:09.840
where I go to school. Next time you're sick with whatever plague you catch next okay on the

18:09.840 --> 18:10.480
couch

18:10.480 --> 18:14.300
instead of Kingdom Hearts 2 put that down and watch Sin City for a little bit.

18:14.300 --> 18:17.940
I will if my husband makes me. Alright.

18:17.940 --> 18:21.500
I still have to watch Uzumaki. Really weird Japanese movie.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.620
That's a great film. UK News. Okay, oh yeah.

18:24.620 --> 18:29.500
Um, Battle Royale 3, no. Ace Combat on PSP.

18:29.500 --> 18:34.980
Ace Combat X, Skies of Deception. And I think it is X and not X, because they haven't

18:34.980 --> 18:35.740
gone up to,

18:35.740 --> 18:38.820
you know, past, what, five.

18:38.820 --> 18:42.580
So, uh, it's going to be on the PSP.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.580
Um, it's a combination campaign-based, uh,

18:45.580 --> 18:48.860
single-player plane thingy with

18:48.860 --> 18:57.060
Wireless multiplayer and speaking of numbers. I have not played one ace combat game. I have ace combat for okay

18:57.540 --> 18:58.900
I

18:58.900 --> 19:02.460
Actually, I've wasn't the first one on Super Famicom. I

19:03.580 --> 19:09.980
Have not played one ace combat game original PlayStation. That's right. No, it's another game. I'm thinking of I'm thinking of

19:11.260 --> 19:14.540
Anyway, it doesn't matter. It's not top gun. I don't care

19:14.540 --> 19:16.060
Dude, Top Gun was awesome.

19:16.060 --> 19:17.860
Top Gun's coming out for the DS.

19:17.860 --> 19:18.860
Fuck yeah!

19:18.860 --> 19:19.860
For me.

19:19.860 --> 19:20.860
Fuck yeah!

19:20.860 --> 19:22.300
But is it going to be incredibly difficult to land?

19:22.300 --> 19:25.980
No, how hard is it going to be to refuel your damn plane?

19:25.980 --> 19:26.980
Ugh.

19:26.980 --> 19:28.980
Don't remind me.

19:28.980 --> 19:29.980
Nightmares.

19:29.980 --> 19:38.060
Famitsu stated that Namco said that Skies of Deception will feature an original storyline

19:38.060 --> 19:40.980
all told through CG.

19:40.980 --> 19:48.140
be a pilot in the Griffis squadron of the Federal Republic of Aurelia. You have

19:48.140 --> 19:54.820
four planes the F-14D Super Tomcat, Tornado F-3, F-2A, and MIG-31 Foxhound.

19:54.820 --> 20:03.780
Foxhound. You know what they need to tie it in with? Ace Combat 6 Oblivion. Shut up.

20:03.780 --> 20:06.900
so it's actually slated to be out um

20:06.900 --> 20:10.540
this fall in Japan hot

20:10.540 --> 20:15.700
guess what what MMOs oh goody another crack for me to get it to to

20:15.700 --> 20:20.100

20:20.860 --> 20:24.180

20:46.980 --> 20:52.380
what were you saying anyway? You were talking about Pirates of the Caribbean you better go

20:52.380 --> 20:55.900
Disney

20:55.900 --> 20:57.900
We love Disney

20:58.380 --> 21:04.100
They announced the PC MMO Pirates of the Caribbean online will be there to show at e3

21:04.580 --> 21:12.060
But not on stores until 2007 it was supposed to launch with the next film coming out dead man's chest

21:12.420 --> 21:15.340
In the summer, but it's gonna be later

21:15.340 --> 21:20.860

not except for Final Fantasy 11 both on 360 and the expansion on PlayStation 2

23:38.980 --> 23:44.700
and in the PC. But other than that really there is nothing coming out this week

23:44.700 --> 23:47.060

24:04.660 --> 24:05.540
talking about

24:05.540 --> 24:08.560
puzzle pirates to I'm sick

24:08.560 --> 24:12.860
higher its I never mind you are the addict a puzzle higher

24:12.860 --> 24:17.140
I it was a fun game I would like to know I I I'm that they have actually

24:17.140 --> 24:21.500
announced the MMO last year at E3.

24:21.500 --> 24:25.580
Oh, okay. They gave out these stupid gold coins that you would get

24:25.580 --> 24:28.860
to go have special access to

24:28.860 --> 24:31.940
the show floor or something

24:31.940 --> 24:35.540
this year. So yeah, we knew it was coming.

24:35.540 --> 24:40.700
Anyways, what we didn't know was coming though was this game coming from Acclaim

24:40.700 --> 24:44.500
who's doing a martial arts MMO. That's right,

24:44.500 --> 24:51.500
martial arts MMO. No one cares. Anyways, it's going to be called Nine Dragons, being developed

24:51.560 --> 24:58.560
by Indie21. And it's supposed to be to put gamers in their own kung fu fighting online

24:59.460 --> 25:06.460
game. Sounds kind of like Matrix Online to me, because that game is all kung fu. Anyways,

25:06.460 --> 25:14.580
Anyways, um, it's currently being planned to be released later this year, so look for

25:14.580 --> 25:15.580
that.

25:15.580 --> 25:19.780
First off, why are there so many MMOs?

25:19.780 --> 25:24.740
I mean, cause you may, cause not only do you get the sucker to buy the game at first, but

25:24.740 --> 25:28.260
then you get them to pay for it every month, that's why.

25:28.260 --> 25:31.060
Because we keep buying them?

25:31.060 --> 25:32.060
I guess.

25:32.060 --> 25:36.100
Where's my blaster master MMO?

25:36.100 --> 25:41.000
Alright. You might remember one very popular MMO started on a Dreamcast,

25:41.000 --> 25:44.580
on the Dreamcast, that was Phantasy Star. Although I don't know if I'd call Phantasy

25:44.580 --> 25:46.060
Star so much an MMO

25:46.060 --> 25:49.780
as it is like a multiplayer experience. It's a multiplayer

25:49.780 --> 25:53.820
repetitive action game. Yes. Which I actually still occasionally play.

25:53.820 --> 25:57.620
Alright. A story from

25:57.620 --> 26:01.340
Retro Gaming has been circulating the

26:01.340 --> 26:05.980
blogs, video game stuff out there this week. It's games that defined

26:05.980 --> 26:09.380
the Dreamcast. So I thought maybe we could nerd out a little bit and talk

26:09.380 --> 26:10.780
about the Dreamcast for a minute.

26:10.780 --> 26:13.980
What do you think are some games that defined the Dreamcast?

26:13.980 --> 26:17.740
Since you mentioned Phantasy Star Universe, I'd like to mention that Phantasy Star

26:17.740 --> 26:20.580
Universe is supposed to be coming out on October 25th.

26:20.580 --> 26:23.420
One of the ones I forgot to mention. Is that from your little list there? Yeah.

26:23.420 --> 26:24.100
Alright, there you go.

26:24.100 --> 26:27.180
Um, Blue Stinger.

26:27.180 --> 26:30.820
Because, and I'm referring specifically to the Japanese version because the U.S.

26:30.820 --> 26:31.980
version was ass.

26:31.980 --> 26:35.860
As in not even a nice one as more like a stinky unwashed ass.

26:35.860 --> 26:39.740
Thank you for that visual.

26:39.740 --> 26:47.620
The Japanese one had these really massive camera angles, just cinematic, and even though

26:47.620 --> 26:56.340
the gameplay was pretty beat thingy with stick, lightsaber, run up a tower, blah blah blah,

26:56.340 --> 26:58.260
the camera angles I thought were just so neat.

26:58.260 --> 27:02.420
It was such a different experience playing that as opposed to a lot of the stuff that

27:02.420 --> 27:05.300
was on the PlayStation because you know you scroll out too far on PlayStation it would

27:05.300 --> 27:11.440
just completely look crap but it's kept such a good look I mean it made it difficult to

27:11.440 --> 27:18.400
play in places but you know I actually liked Boostinger. I traded my copy of the Dragon

27:18.400 --> 27:23.080
Ball GT game. Alright. Which at the time was stupid because it was going for 150 bucks

27:23.080 --> 27:28.920
on eBay. Oh we all make mistakes. Loki, Spike, any defining Dreamcast games for you? Power

27:28.920 --> 27:35.420
Powerstone, Crazy Taxi, and Jet Set Radio.

27:35.420 --> 27:44.540
That's another, um, crap, Evolution, actually, I thought, because it brought out, actually

27:44.540 --> 27:47.100
Grandia 2 was also another good one.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.100
Space Channel 5.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.100
Space Channel 5.

27:49.100 --> 27:53.380
Spike, anything that comes to mind for you?

27:53.380 --> 27:56.460
So Project Justice definitely comes to mind.

27:56.460 --> 27:57.460
Amen!

27:57.460 --> 27:59.620
Japanese one with the little board game.

27:59.620 --> 28:03.180
Yes! That was so much fun and you could customize your character.

28:03.180 --> 28:06.120
You know what though, I have to admit, I was a little upset that we didn't have

28:06.120 --> 28:09.420
another school life mode like the Japanese PlayStation games.

28:09.420 --> 28:12.780
Yeah, the second rival school that they did,

28:12.780 --> 28:17.300
the Shiri to Justice Gakuen that they did, I actually, I paid 90 bucks to

28:17.300 --> 28:18.300
import that thing.

28:18.300 --> 28:21.660
Me too! Because I had such a hard time finding it, and

28:21.660 --> 28:26.020
I loved playing through the high school mode, and I got wished happy birthday by Batsu.

28:26.020 --> 28:30.020
Aww, see, I was always trying to get Nagare to fall in love with me.

28:30.020 --> 28:31.020
I never did.

28:31.020 --> 28:34.020
But it's the game that gave us the, uh...

28:34.020 --> 28:36.020
You could play as, uh...

28:36.020 --> 28:37.020
Ran?

28:37.020 --> 28:38.020
As Ran, as, uh...

28:38.020 --> 28:41.020
Nagare, and...

28:41.020 --> 28:42.020
But, uh...

28:42.020 --> 28:43.020
But, uh...

28:43.020 --> 28:46.020
Moru, Justice Gakuen, gave us, um...

28:46.020 --> 28:48.020
Zaki, who was...

28:48.020 --> 28:49.020
The sex.

28:49.020 --> 28:50.020
I actually...

28:50.020 --> 28:53.020
One of my first pieces of fan art that ever got published by another site

28:53.020 --> 28:57.460
was one of the big rival schools websites took a fan art I did of Zaki

28:57.460 --> 29:01.780
you're listening to the geeky Dreamcast gamer podcast and of course we've got to

29:01.780 --> 29:08.260
mention DDR second mix club version all right that was my first DDR that I owned

29:08.260 --> 29:11.440
extrovert wants to participate in tonight's show by naming I guess

29:11.440 --> 29:15.740
something a Dreamcast game I'm surprised that you didn't name it but Sonic

29:15.740 --> 29:24.380
adventure right okay yeah and extra brings extra brings the show to a

29:24.380 --> 29:28.500
screeching halt no I'm kidding no no Sonic Adventure was fun it is it's I

29:28.500 --> 29:37.440
liked it actually one of my favorite games ever was was the berserk game

29:37.440 --> 29:43.640
cuz we got it though before the anime came out over here and I was like when I

29:43.640 --> 29:47.760
I found out that one of my favorite voice actors was Gatsu's voice.

29:47.760 --> 29:50.120
I was like, okay, I'm importing this crap.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.280
And so I went and found it for 20 bucks.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.080
So now I have both versions of it.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.080
But yeah.

29:55.080 --> 29:58.880
And then I fell in love with the anime, but I'd still need to get the manga because it's

29:58.880 --> 29:59.880
really messed up.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.400
The manga is much better.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.760
But it was a very good game.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.360
Can I do another couple of Dreamcast games?

30:04.360 --> 30:06.000
All right, real quick, then we gotta move on.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.880
So like, we've got Ikaruga.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.360
Yes.

30:10.360 --> 30:17.040
The Dreamcast Direct version of Vampire Chronicles, much better than the Chaos Tower BS super

30:17.040 --> 30:19.540
long load time PSP version.

30:19.540 --> 30:22.600
There was also the For Matching Service series of Street Fighter games.

30:22.600 --> 30:27.920
Yes, which, you know, SNK vs. Capcom 2, you know, because the game was meant to run on

30:27.920 --> 30:28.920
a Naomi board.

30:28.920 --> 30:29.920
Guilty Gear X.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.520
Guilty Gear X, absolutely, although, you know.

30:32.520 --> 30:33.520
Virtual On.

30:33.520 --> 30:35.240
Oh yes.

30:35.240 --> 30:38.640
And if you've got the twin sticks, oh yeah.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.640
I bought the little Saturn adapter so I could use my Saturn twin sticks.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.040
Ah, I still need Saturn twin sticks.

30:43.040 --> 30:43.840
Alright, nerds, we gotta...

30:43.840 --> 30:46.340
Did you ever have Dreamcast sex?

30:46.340 --> 30:47.840
Alright, stop it.

30:47.840 --> 30:50.640
Nerds, we gotta get to the chat room feedback here.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.840
Dark Knight says SNK vs. Capcom 2.

30:53.840 --> 30:57.340
Hitstun says Metropolis Street Racer.

30:57.340 --> 31:01.540
Tigerclaw says don't forget Crazy Taxi on the Dreamcast.

31:01.540 --> 31:05.140
And let's see, Amplitude says MVC 2.

31:05.140 --> 31:06.540
Lots and lots of good choices.

31:06.540 --> 31:10.020
GS-191 hit the nail on the head, C-Man.

31:10.020 --> 31:16.980
The original story named these games, Soul Calibur, Shenmue, Jet Grind Radio, Space Channel

31:16.980 --> 31:22.580
5, Crazy Taxi, Virtua Tennis and Tennis 2K2, Skies of Arcadia, the both Power Stone games,

31:22.580 --> 31:28.260
both Sonic Adventure games, Samba de Amigo, hello, we started as a music thing, we should

31:28.260 --> 31:32.620
have known about that one, Virtua Fighter, Echo the Dolphin, Defender of the Future,

31:32.620 --> 31:39.340
Choo Choo Rocket, Phantasy Star Online, Street Fighter III Third Strike, Ikaruga, and import

31:39.340 --> 31:43.260
games like Rez.

31:43.260 --> 31:44.260
There was Rez.

31:44.260 --> 31:45.260
Good stuff.

31:45.260 --> 31:47.460
Alright, that was our Dreamcast geeky moment.

31:47.460 --> 31:48.460
Enjoy.

31:48.460 --> 31:51.300
Actually, I do have one of the crappiest games ever for Dreamcast.

31:51.300 --> 31:52.300
Shenmue?

31:52.300 --> 31:55.580
No, it was import only super producers.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.980
Where you managed the career of a pop idol.

31:58.980 --> 32:00.820
You know what my favorite Dreamcast game is?

32:00.820 --> 32:01.820
DC-ness.

32:01.820 --> 32:02.820
Definitely.

32:02.820 --> 32:12.340
You know what else game came out, was the roommate 2-1-3 or something, where you play

32:12.340 --> 32:14.760
as some guy's roommate?

32:14.760 --> 32:16.260
I thought of a really, really good one.

32:16.260 --> 32:17.260
I thought of a really weird one.

32:17.260 --> 32:18.260
What, what, what?

32:18.260 --> 32:19.260
The Typing of the Dead.

32:19.260 --> 32:20.260
Typing of the Dead!

32:20.260 --> 32:21.260
Yay!

32:21.260 --> 32:22.260
Yay, I win!

32:22.260 --> 32:24.700
I get to participate in the geeky chat.

32:24.700 --> 32:28.040
It also has spawned some of the best cosplay ever.

32:28.040 --> 32:31.960
I plan on eventually doing some cosplay once people kind of forget about that game.

32:31.960 --> 32:34.960
Alright, we really, really gotta move on, I'm sorry, alright.

32:34.960 --> 32:39.040
Some people are saying that the Xbox 360 is kind of a new version of the Dreamcast, I

32:39.040 --> 32:44.760
don't know, take it or leave it, but what's going on with Burnout on the Xbox 360, Loki?

32:44.760 --> 32:49.520
They finally, finally fixed it.

32:49.520 --> 32:56.320
So now I can play the damn car I downloaded off the Xbox 360 kiosk months ago.

32:56.320 --> 33:00.080
Stupid bastards, teasing me at the damn car that I'd be able to play when I get the game

33:00.080 --> 33:02.320
and couldn't play it for months.

33:02.320 --> 33:07.880
Anyways, but, they did add some new cars to download as well online so you can get a bunch

33:07.880 --> 33:11.080
of cars that they've hoarded out from different sponsors.

33:11.080 --> 33:18.800
And one of the updates, well other than the cars, the kiosks working now, you cannot spam

33:18.800 --> 33:22.800
your recommended clips to people on your recent players list.

33:22.800 --> 33:27.440
In other words people that you just played in games you can't go hey look at my clip that I made that sucks

33:27.440 --> 33:29.440
I just want to get achievements so there

33:31.440 --> 33:36.960
I'm sure people are excited about that, but the burnout the burnout cars look pretty cool

33:37.040 --> 33:39.560
They've got a spike TV car

33:40.200 --> 33:42.200
They've actually got

33:42.560 --> 33:44.560
yellow card car

33:44.560 --> 33:45.920
uh...

33:45.920 --> 33:46.880
it's like it

33:46.880 --> 33:52.760
don't dole be car if you ever wanted to drive a shitty band now's your chance

33:52.760 --> 33:55.480
i was sitting here like what's yellow card

33:55.480 --> 33:58.480
thank you rob you're welcome

33:58.480 --> 34:00.240
i did check it out a little bit

34:00.240 --> 34:03.480
uh... or try to but the only thing i don't like it you have to unlock the

34:03.480 --> 34:05.800
cars in the game

34:05.800 --> 34:09.960
so picasa alright

34:09.960 --> 34:11.080
go check that out

34:11.080 --> 34:12.400
downloaded enjoy it

34:12.400 --> 34:15.000
Uh, one person that will probably not be playing, yes?

34:15.000 --> 34:17.600
The chat room just made me happy because they remembered Rod Caliber.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.200
Dorks.

34:19.200 --> 34:20.800
We're done with Dreamcast, we're done with Grant.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.300
I know, but it has a special place in my heart.

34:23.300 --> 34:25.300
We can never be done with Dreamcast.

34:25.300 --> 34:29.700
One person that never touched a Dreamcast, you can be certain, is Jack Thompson, and

34:29.700 --> 34:32.200
what's Jack up to this week, DarkSakura?

34:32.200 --> 34:34.300
Jacky-poo is being a poopyhead.

34:34.300 --> 34:36.900
Um, oh, I'm sorry, professionalism, right?

34:36.900 --> 34:41.900
Um, well, he's filed suit against the Florida Bar Association.

34:41.900 --> 34:50.580
So, basically, as reported by a Daily Business Review, also reposted with Game Politics,

34:50.580 --> 34:52.580
who are heroes.

34:52.580 --> 34:53.580
We love them.

34:53.580 --> 34:57.420
Yeah, he's filed a million dollar federal lawsuit against the Florida Bar saying that

34:57.420 --> 35:05.100
the organization is harassing him by investigating his baseless complaints.

35:05.100 --> 35:08.140
One million dollars!

35:08.140 --> 35:13.540
But, and I love what Game Politics commented on this, just a quote.

35:13.540 --> 35:17.340
We're glad someone enjoys what Jack does, but we've reread the First Amendment umpteen

35:17.340 --> 35:20.980
times and still can't find the right to annoy people.

35:20.980 --> 35:23.180
Amen.

35:23.180 --> 35:27.140
I love this post in our forums, if I could read this from our forums.

35:27.140 --> 35:32.420
This is from one of my, I love this listener, he makes a lot of great posts on our forums

35:32.420 --> 35:33.420
here.

35:33.420 --> 35:34.420
The Ichiban Crush.

35:34.420 --> 35:36.660
He posted the bunny picture on my MySpace.

35:36.660 --> 35:38.980
We love our listeners, and this guy is just living proof.

35:38.980 --> 35:40.500
I love this post he made.

35:40.500 --> 35:44.380
Regarding Jacky Poo, I actually hope no one makes a game to his description.

35:44.380 --> 35:48.940
This is a follow-up to last week's story where we talked about the whole Jack Thompson hates

35:48.940 --> 35:50.660
Joystick and all that.

35:50.660 --> 35:53.200
Because with his last modest proposal, what did he do?

35:53.200 --> 35:57.020
Back out of his promise of donating $10,000 to charity when someone called his bluff.

35:57.020 --> 36:00.900
Oh, and let's not even get into the hissy-fitsy targeted towards everyone who pointed out

36:00.900 --> 36:04.420
Jack's lack of credibility or paid the fee on his behalf.

36:04.420 --> 36:09.700
Why are we even giving a shit about this parasitic, ambulance chasing, morally bankrupted, failure

36:09.700 --> 36:11.780
of a lawyer and human being anymore?

36:11.780 --> 36:15.620
In the grand scheme of things, has he made an ounce of influence in the way we as gamers

36:15.620 --> 36:17.340
or the game industry does its thing?

36:17.340 --> 36:18.680
No, not at all.

36:18.680 --> 36:21.800
What we have here is an over glorified internet troll.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.260
Nothing more, nothing less.

36:23.260 --> 36:27.220
His own actions weaken any and all chance for these holy crusades coming through.

36:27.220 --> 36:30.740
This isn't even about fundamentalist antics anymore because it seems even those guys are

36:30.740 --> 36:31.840
laughing at him.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.900
So no, I wouldn't give him what he wants.

36:33.900 --> 36:38.340
people to cry wolf about to the authorities it's trolls bait folks don't

36:38.340 --> 36:45.180
bite love it love it should we even be reporting on him anymore I don't know I

36:45.180 --> 36:49.600
feel like we have an obligation to but at the same time I totally get the

36:49.600 --> 36:54.720
village idiot perspective I'm sick you know I'm really sick of everything

36:54.720 --> 36:58.840
having to do with his name coming up you know we dealt with him what in the mid

36:58.840 --> 37:03.480
90s over the whole cop killer thing mm-hmm you know for iced tea and now

37:03.480 --> 37:05.400
Now we're dealing with him over video games.

37:05.400 --> 37:11.680
See I would love to start like this big thing like podcasts against reporting on Jack Thompson.

37:11.680 --> 37:16.800
I think it would be a great thing but then by doing that you would be reporting on it.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.600
So I can't, I'm stuck.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.320
I don't know what to do.

37:20.320 --> 37:21.800
Podcasts against Jackie Poo.

37:21.800 --> 37:28.480
But the thing is though is that I don't see, you know of course people are going to complain

37:28.480 --> 37:32.680
about him because he's displayed this utter lack of professionalism in all of his dealings

37:32.680 --> 37:34.760
with everybody.

37:34.760 --> 37:39.880
People have reposted emails where he has just completely gone to name calling and finger

37:39.880 --> 37:43.480
pointing like a freaking schoolyard bully.

37:43.480 --> 37:48.440
That's all he is, an overblown bully.

37:48.440 --> 37:51.840
All he's trying to do is keep his name in the spotlight.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.860
This isn't about helping families.

37:53.860 --> 37:56.380
This isn't about cleaning up America.

37:56.380 --> 38:01.240
This is about keeping money in his pocket and the spotlight on him.

38:01.240 --> 38:05.320
One thing though that I guess is a good thing that comes from all this reporting on this

38:05.320 --> 38:09.040
guy is it really does bring the game community together in really interesting ways.

38:09.040 --> 38:14.280
Take that whole pixelante thing, the flowers for Jack, at least there's that good, that

38:14.280 --> 38:17.240
little silver lining that comes out of it as it brings people together out of their

38:17.240 --> 38:18.240
hatred for this guy.

38:18.240 --> 38:23.060
Well, what he needs to also keep in mind that the majority of people who buy video games

38:23.060 --> 38:26.720
are in our age group, the people in this room.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.000
We are the ones who are paying for these games.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.860
you're the ones who are doing a lot of the playing and true yeah a lot of you

38:31.860 --> 38:36.360
know you know teenagers and you know younger kids are playing games but

38:36.360 --> 38:39.680
we're the ones who've been keeping the industry going we were there from the

38:39.680 --> 38:47.640
beginning you know you know if he's and like I've brought up before there has

38:47.640 --> 38:51.560
been so much concrete proof to refute everything he's saying and he just

38:51.560 --> 38:57.880
refuses to accept the fact as fact I honestly I'm sick of him I'm sick of how

38:57.880 --> 39:00.960
utterly stupid he is. He's proof

39:00.960 --> 39:04.920
that one can have a college education and still be retarded.

39:04.920 --> 39:08.560
You can address those cards and letters to

39:08.560 --> 39:13.480
DarkSakura. Please do. If he emails anybody, email me. I will tell you

39:13.480 --> 39:14.720
exactly what I think about you.

39:14.720 --> 39:18.360
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if anybody wants to comment. Oh yeah, absolutely.

39:18.360 --> 39:21.780
Alright, well guess what? The US isn't the only place where video games are

39:21.780 --> 39:22.640
investigated.

39:22.640 --> 39:27.320
Japan's National Police Agency is currently investigating the effects

39:27.320 --> 39:31.240
playing video games and watching anime has on children.

39:31.240 --> 39:39.760
This is being led by a former deputy governor of Tokyo, Yutaka Takahana.

39:39.760 --> 39:44.800
These guys met on April 10th in Tokyo to discuss violent video games and sexual content on

39:44.800 --> 39:45.800
the internet.

39:45.800 --> 39:49.360
Previously, though, there really hasn't been a whole lot of controversy in Japan regarding

39:49.360 --> 39:54.680
the in-game violence, but this current generation of games, of course, Grand Theft Auto and

39:54.680 --> 40:00.780
and so on sort of brings us back to the spotlight there.

40:00.780 --> 40:05.280
Also it should be pointed out the sale of Grand Theft Auto 3 was actually banned from

40:05.280 --> 40:13.460
being sold to anyone under the age of 18 in two separate Japanese prefectures and so on

40:13.460 --> 40:17.520
so they're just doing this study here I guess seeing if maybe they need to be a little more

40:17.520 --> 40:20.920
tighter on this stuff in Japan.

40:20.920 --> 40:21.920
I don't know.

40:21.920 --> 40:22.920
That'll happen.

40:22.920 --> 40:27.440
does it's just warp our sense of what kind of women we can achieve you know

40:27.440 --> 40:32.680
and women you know don't have breasts that are that big at least not that many

40:32.680 --> 40:40.600
of them all right and also tentacle rape is not good all this stuff about the

40:40.600 --> 40:45.280
laws and the people that keep talking about this stuff it just makes me angry

40:45.280 --> 40:48.400
I don't know about you guys but I get a little bit angry when I think about this

40:48.400 --> 40:51.480
stuff and so that's why we have a segment here on orange lounge radio

40:51.480 --> 40:55.480
Dedicated to getting a little bit of this angst out of the system out of our system

40:55.480 --> 40:59.400
And it's called the F use of the week. Are you ready to get angsty boys and girls?

41:00.120 --> 41:02.120
more owl

41:13.360 --> 41:15.120
Dark Sakura

41:15.120 --> 41:19.520
F you to whatever that fatigue shit. I had was earlier in the week because it sucked

41:19.520 --> 41:26.520
I actually like being able to get out of bed and do stuff, and I hate missing the show,

41:26.600 --> 41:32.600
so yeah, just F you to whatever has caused the weird random fatigue I had.

41:32.600 --> 41:37.200
LOKI F you to the metal alcohol that I drank last

41:37.200 --> 41:44.200
night, because that sucked, and F you to certain sites that report certain stories without

41:44.200 --> 41:51.200
that report certain stories without citing certain references.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.200
Thank you.

41:53.200 --> 41:56.200
Spike! Do you have any FUs?

41:56.200 --> 41:59.200
FU to cellular phones that don't work.

41:59.200 --> 42:02.200
That would make me angry too.

42:02.200 --> 42:06.200
My FU this week goes to Loki for not singing karaoke last night,

42:06.200 --> 42:08.200
despite how drunk we got him.

42:08.200 --> 42:11.200
You'll have to kill me for this, you big pussy.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.200
Will you sing when you die?

42:13.200 --> 42:24.320
die? Maybe. He'll sing when he's dead. Loki! Sing to us a little bit about the Nintendo

42:24.320 --> 42:30.480
DS's other news. The DS is getting a TV... No, I said sing! I'm just kidding, go ahead.

42:30.480 --> 42:40.040
The DS is getting a TV tuner. A TV tuner the size of an Xbox. No, the TV tuner is ginormous.

42:40.040 --> 42:46.720
And yeah, it's not very portable, but if you're interested, it is available.

42:46.720 --> 42:50.060
And apparently, well, I don't know.

42:50.060 --> 42:55.840
It's being reported by Famitsu Magazine, they have a picture of it, and it literally is

42:55.840 --> 42:58.400
bigger than a DS.

42:58.400 --> 43:03.080
And we're talking old DS, wow.

43:03.080 --> 43:07.280
And apparently, you know, if it's like any of the other TV tuners out there, probably

43:07.280 --> 43:08.960
doesn't get very good reception.

43:08.960 --> 43:13.840
Alright, so why would anybody want to buy this?

43:13.840 --> 43:18.240
Because people like their TV on the go. I don't know.

43:18.240 --> 43:21.840
Fair enough. Alright, also coming to the DS,

43:21.840 --> 43:26.040
Sudoku Gridmaster. Nintendo recently announced that they're going to be putting

43:26.040 --> 43:26.720
this out.

43:26.720 --> 43:31.000
It's gonna have over 400 puzzles and use the DS's touchscreen and handwriting

43:31.000 --> 43:32.800
recognition software.

43:32.800 --> 43:36.480
You'll have practice mode, easy mode, normal, and hard mode.

43:36.480 --> 43:40.400
The game is supposed to come out June 26. What I'm not sure of though is if that

43:40.400 --> 43:41.440
means Japan

43:41.440 --> 43:47.160
or the US. And I'm thinking, come on, another freaking Sudoku game?

43:47.160 --> 43:51.120
I think the only way this game would sell is if they made it look like

43:51.120 --> 43:52.480
Tetris DS. Like put

43:52.480 --> 43:57.220
16-bit Nintendo characters in it. Oh it's Mario presents Sudoku! And then it

43:57.220 --> 43:58.000
would sell

43:58.000 --> 44:01.760
like freaking crazy. What do you want to bet?

44:01.760 --> 44:05.000
Just put Link on it, put Zelda's face on it, do something,

44:05.000 --> 44:08.040
and people will eat that shit up. It's the Legend of Sudoku.

44:08.040 --> 44:12.560
That's the Legend of Sudoku. Dun dun! I'm going to name my firstborn Sudoku.

44:12.560 --> 44:16.740
Why? I'm not. But I am naming my-

44:16.740 --> 44:20.080
when I have a son I'm naming him Richter, after Richter Belmont.

44:20.080 --> 44:23.840
Because you're a geek. Can you pronounce it like the bad English dub?

44:23.840 --> 44:28.600
Richter! Richter! Where you have to wipe out your eye every time you talk to Maria.

44:28.600 --> 44:33.200
Thank you for knowing where I was going with that. Before Doc Sakura coughs up a lung there

44:33.200 --> 44:40.760
with uh the uh reactor thing the grudge is like two years old now stop all right although

44:40.760 --> 44:44.320
they do make a reference to the grudge in scary movie 4 which came out on friday yes

44:44.320 --> 44:50.200
but i heard it sucks uh loki it was funny i don't know you heard wrong well it's a matter

44:50.200 --> 44:53.920
of everyone's opinion what did it get on the tomato meter that's what i want to know no

44:53.920 --> 44:59.060
i really have no interest in seeing it all right uh loki more ds new mario brothers what's

44:59.060 --> 45:02.480
happening with that yeah they're going to be having some of the mini games in mario

45:02.480 --> 45:07.480
brothers. Very similar to what you saw in Super Mario 64 for the DS. To be honest, I

45:07.480 --> 45:11.920
think I played the minigames more than I actually played the games. But this time around, you'll

45:11.920 --> 45:17.240
actually be able to play the multiplayer, which is pretty sweet. So, some minigame action

45:17.240 --> 45:23.800
for you to be shared with friends. That's gonna be fun. Can't wait. It's gonna be fun-tastic.

45:23.800 --> 45:28.120
Fun-tastic. Another friend code for you to have to manage with your friends. That should

45:28.120 --> 45:32.420
be a lot of fun. Well, I don't know if it's over the internet. I don't think it's through

45:32.420 --> 45:41.260
their wifi service. I think it's just local. Oh. Lame. Alright. DarkSakura likes to surf

45:41.260 --> 45:46.240
the internet up and down researching Dreamcast games, but once in a while she comes on another

45:46.240 --> 45:50.640
website that she wants to share with all of you guys. It's DarkSakura's website of the

45:50.640 --> 45:55.360
week. And where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week, DarkSakura? This

45:55.360 --> 46:01.920
This is a site that's had me mesmerized for about 3 hours as a few people online.

46:01.920 --> 46:02.920
Ron was one of them.

46:02.920 --> 46:05.200
Can attest too because I kept linking pictures.

46:05.200 --> 46:06.200
Snopes.com.

46:06.200 --> 46:07.200
S-N-O-P-E-S.com.

46:07.200 --> 46:11.440
It's basically an urban legends reference page.

46:11.440 --> 46:12.440
It's fabulous.

46:12.440 --> 46:17.520
In fact, someone on my... and I knew about this site for a while, but someone actually

46:17.520 --> 46:23.460
linked a picture of the world's largest rabbit, who was like as big as a dog.

46:23.460 --> 46:28.260
a golden retriever and and it's real and there's lots of interesting pictures in

46:28.260 --> 46:35.700
here like the Cyclops cat and a twin well a two-headed baby it actually was

46:35.700 --> 46:40.340
like a head and half of a body attached to her head they actually had the other

46:40.340 --> 46:45.380
twin removed but yeah I mean some of this is you know there's the fake ones

46:45.380 --> 46:49.620
on here it's basically any urban legend that's been reported and they investigate

46:49.620 --> 46:52.620
it and let you know if it's real or not I love this site because I get those

46:52.620 --> 46:57.220
crappy forwards from co-workers all the time of these totally untrue things and

46:57.220 --> 47:00.780
what I'll do is I'll go on to Snopes.com and find the little article and I'll

47:00.780 --> 47:06.900
just copy paste the link in an email back and I always reply to all. Good but

47:06.900 --> 47:15.500
I'm just for a little overview the hottest 25 urban legends as of this week

47:15.500 --> 47:21.540
is there's one about gas there's the giant rabbit one about Bill Gates doing

47:21.540 --> 47:26.460
Microsoft and AOL giveaway and about the brown recluse spider the effects of the

47:26.460 --> 47:31.880
brown recluse all right so check it out it should be required reading for

47:31.880 --> 47:36.060
anybody who wants to send a forward email and for the for the sake of the

47:36.060 --> 47:39.760
chat room I am going to link the giant rabbit story all right there you go

47:39.760 --> 47:43.080
otherwise you'll have to beg for it in the forums I forgot to mention when

47:43.080 --> 47:48.420
we're talking about useless games and stuff that's coming out this week brain

47:48.420 --> 47:53.840
Age is actually coming out this week. Oh, is it? Yeah. Oh, I told it's this week. I believe so cool

47:54.500 --> 48:00.120
Well so much for useless games coming. I really want that one. It's still not a game. I want to check it out anyway

48:01.040 --> 48:05.880
One game I've always been meaning to check out that I seem to never get around to is Civilization 4

48:05.980 --> 48:10.100
Well, there's actually a past see what I'm waiting for is I'm waiting for like the ultimate Civ 4

48:10.360 --> 48:14.540
Compilation to come out for 20 bucks in like a year because that's what always happens with civilization games

48:14.540 --> 48:19.340
But anyway, if you're a rabid Civilization fan who's getting your fix right now, there's

48:19.340 --> 48:23.680
a brand new patch that just came out, and it's circulating on the internet.

48:23.680 --> 48:28.080
And part of it is just a patch to up your game to 1.61, you know, bug fixes, tweaks,

48:28.080 --> 48:29.080
all that fun stuff.

48:29.080 --> 48:31.800
However, the other part of this is very cool.

48:31.800 --> 48:36.900
It's a software development kit, and what it'll do is it'll let programmers basically

48:36.900 --> 48:41.620
mess with the inner functions and make user-created mods.

48:41.620 --> 48:46.100
So I think that's very cool is that Civ 4 is really embracing the mod community.

48:46.100 --> 48:48.820
And I remember them saying they were going to do this when the game first launched but

48:48.820 --> 48:52.500
they're really putting it out there where anybody can make their own Civ 4 scenarios.

48:52.500 --> 48:54.040
I think that's very cool.

48:54.040 --> 48:57.540
And I know we've had folks email us in the past wanting to know more about these types

48:57.540 --> 48:59.540
of games that you can mod and all that good stuff.

48:59.540 --> 49:03.640
So this is a good one right here, Civilization 4, make your own scenarios.

49:03.640 --> 49:08.100
It is down to $30 if you want to pick up the game, down from I think $50 when it first

49:08.100 --> 49:09.100
came out.

49:09.100 --> 49:15.660
$9.99, or as I call it, $30.

49:15.660 --> 49:16.660
Moving on.

49:16.660 --> 49:17.660
Loki!

49:17.660 --> 49:18.660
Yes.

49:18.660 --> 49:20.340
What's making a comeback?

49:20.340 --> 49:24.220
Hopefully not a wee bull, but, Alone in the Dark.

49:24.220 --> 49:28.260
I mean, I remember they were showing some pictures of Alone in the Dark, the new one,

49:28.260 --> 49:31.540
and they're actually kind of pretty cool and they have some screenshots up right now.

49:31.540 --> 49:36.340
But 1UP is reporting that Alone in the Dark will rear its head on next-gen consoles very

49:36.340 --> 49:37.340
soon.

49:37.340 --> 49:42.940
probably will see at E3, maybe. But we'll have to wait, they're going to be showing

49:42.940 --> 49:49.940
it in I think the next electronic gaming monthly. So, should be interesting.

49:51.880 --> 49:56.380
Are you Alone in the Dark? Yes, and I'm playing a crappy video game called Alone in the Dark.

49:56.380 --> 49:58.980
If I remember correctly, I did read a little bit about this.

49:58.980 --> 50:02.220
Just teasing, I'm teasing, I'm teasing. It's actually supposed to be set in Central

50:02.220 --> 50:09.020
Park in New York and something about um I don't remember now but um some

50:09.020 --> 50:16.500
paranormal of course violent paranormal hobos horrible movies being made who is

50:16.500 --> 50:24.340
responsible I want to see typing of the dead make a comeback sudoku of the dead

50:24.460 --> 50:28.780
one more major story for you guys tonight that comes from dark soccer then

50:28.780 --> 50:32.980
We're going to open up our Skype line over at www.orangelonitrader.com, click on interact

50:32.980 --> 50:33.980
with us.

50:33.980 --> 50:35.400
But Arch Soccer has a little bit of a follow-up.

50:35.400 --> 50:40.140
We talked about this title, I think, previously, but now we've got a little more news on it.

50:40.140 --> 50:46.180
There's actually Guitar Man on the PSP.

50:46.180 --> 50:52.020
Basically there is a, on the Japanese Playstation site, there is a product posting announcing

50:52.020 --> 50:57.260
a second Guitar Man, of course, published by Koei.

50:57.260 --> 50:59.800
Koei gave us Keio Flying Squadron, I like them.

50:59.800 --> 51:04.100
Um, but as Guitar Man Live for the PSP,

51:04.100 --> 51:07.780
um, follow up to the first Guitar Man that was on PlayStation 2,

51:07.780 --> 51:12.620
um, there's supposed to- there's speculation that there's gonna be demos at E3.

51:12.620 --> 51:15.820
Hopefully, that will be true. I will be

51:15.820 --> 51:18.900
living at wherever that is. Um,

51:18.900 --> 51:23.060
but, uh, the, uh,

51:23.060 --> 51:28.220
There's very few details out on it right now, although there's a new feature that's being advertised

51:28.940 --> 51:30.940
That has network play

51:31.340 --> 51:36.860
But not online compatible and you can compete head-to-head or cooperative in duet mode

51:38.860 --> 51:46.080
It's supposed to be a bit more balanced the music and vocals are provided by actual Japanese pop stars, so

51:46.080 --> 51:50.200
Maybe it'll be someone that we've heard of over here.

51:50.200 --> 51:53.840
It'll be cool, I think it's going to be pretty cool. I'm looking forward to it.

51:53.840 --> 51:59.080
Alright, sounds good. Our skype line is open over at www.orangelaunchradio.com

51:59.080 --> 52:00.480
Click on interact with us

52:00.480 --> 52:04.320
so let's pick up some calls. Hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

52:04.320 --> 52:08.160
Sweet, I'm the first one on, it's Ranma. Hi Ranma, what's on your mind?

52:08.160 --> 52:12.480
Not much, I want to cover a couple of things and I'm on my way out of here.

52:12.480 --> 52:28.120
I want to talk about the Xbox emulator and I can explain better why it was taking it

52:28.120 --> 52:32.160
so long to convert games and make them more compatible and stuff.

52:32.160 --> 52:35.200
Oh yeah, what is up with that?

52:35.200 --> 52:38.760
On the 360, very few games are compatible.

52:38.760 --> 52:39.760
What's up with that?

52:39.760 --> 52:43.260
You know, from my knowledge, working with computers and technology, it's like this.

52:43.760 --> 52:49.660
Xbox is Pentium 3, and Xbox 360 is like a core cell processor or something like that.

52:49.960 --> 52:54.060
Basically, the emulator has to convert the coding and stuff, so it'll work.

52:54.460 --> 52:57.660
As for the graphics processor, that part really doesn't matter per se,

52:57.660 --> 53:00.060
because even though it's optimized for NVIDIA,

53:00.060 --> 53:05.960
it's still like a generic graphics, it'll still work on the quote-unquote new ATI graphics chipset or whatever.

53:06.260 --> 53:09.260
It's not optimized for NVIDIA, it's built by NVIDIA.

53:09.260 --> 53:13.780
it's a little different but it'll still work regardless even on those games they're

53:13.780 --> 53:14.860
saying they'll work

53:14.860 --> 53:17.940
on that chipset it'll work on others as well

53:17.940 --> 53:24.940
I still think it's fucked that you can play Barbie and not DDR I mean fuck that

53:24.940 --> 53:29.700
I agree I mean I understand why because you know they get one game to work and

53:29.700 --> 53:32.280
usually about 10 games are very similar to that but still

53:32.280 --> 53:36.060
it's messed up it's wrong it's wrong

53:36.060 --> 53:37.740
Know I know

53:37.740 --> 53:44.300
All right, anything else Rana? How goes your training against Jack Thompson? I got 51 odds on you to kick his ass. Oh

53:45.340 --> 53:49.520
No, he's kind of old and broken. Yeah, we wouldn't we won't get win in a fight now

53:49.520 --> 53:53.320
We wouldn't know we don't want to get sued over, you know threatening to fight him or whatever

53:53.420 --> 53:54.860
It's not a threaten to fight

53:54.860 --> 54:01.780
I'm just speculating that if there was if I had to defend myself if a rabid Jack Thompson came to Sacramento

54:01.780 --> 54:07.920
Sacramento and wanted to beat me up or give me rabies then I would win in a fight. He's coming right for us. Ah

54:09.100 --> 54:11.100
Jamie you didn't hear last week's um

54:11.500 --> 54:17.740
Show did you I was sort of dead. Well, I basically told Jack to bring it on. That's all yes

54:17.740 --> 54:21.380
I called Jack out. I said I said bring it bitch. I said bring it

54:21.380 --> 54:25.340
We would own him so I know I know physically I said we could have a war of words

54:25.340 --> 54:29.920
I said I would be cordial to him and let him have his say but then he would have to listen to everything I have

54:29.920 --> 54:34.440
to say in return you know what though that wouldn't be fair because well we

54:34.440 --> 54:40.160
would just completely decimate him I know you cannot have a battle of wits

54:40.160 --> 54:45.040
against an unarmed opponent point taken all right Rama we got to get some more

54:45.040 --> 54:49.360
calls but thank you so much for the call no problem love it love you guys bye

54:49.360 --> 54:53.880
some folks in the chat room are asking did we SSJ 100 Matt wants to know did we

54:53.880 --> 54:56.620
do peep jousting this year that's actually something that happened on the

54:56.620 --> 55:00.620
old show vanilla sky my one of my spin-off shows we did not do peep

55:00.620 --> 55:04.380
jousting this morning and for those that don't know what peep jousting is that is

55:04.380 --> 55:08.980
when you on Easter actually you can do this any day take some marshmallow peeps

55:08.980 --> 55:12.260
but it's easiest around Easter take some marshmallow peeps and stick some

55:12.260 --> 55:16.260
toothpicks in them and then put them in the microwave and watch them get really

55:16.260 --> 55:20.700
really really big and then at one point one peep has to slaughter the other

55:20.700 --> 55:25.300
mercifully no word with the toothpick and it's beautiful to watch because

55:25.300 --> 55:29.020
those things get huge and then you eat them if you're feeling the best part is

55:29.020 --> 55:33.280
after incredibly nasty slightly after Easter going and buying the old peeps

55:33.280 --> 55:36.400
that no one wants you get like packages of those that's what I need to do

55:36.400 --> 55:40.000
tomorrow I need to go to Target and for friggin day oh my god I get such good

55:40.000 --> 55:43.240
candy deals at Target I mean I'm I'm gaining weight and everything so I

55:43.240 --> 55:47.800
probably shouldn't but Oh peeps peeps are so good marshmallows are so gross

55:47.800 --> 55:52.480
they're like diabetes waiting to happen I think we should have a gang of peeps

55:52.480 --> 55:58.560
versus a gang of circus peanuts and we'll see who wins the nuts or the

55:58.560 --> 56:02.040
grand theft candy coming to an orange lounge near you can we go to another

56:02.040 --> 56:05.200
call please beat it in the background while you make this that might be fun

56:05.200 --> 56:11.200
let's go to another call hi you're on orange lounge radio hey hi who's this

56:11.200 --> 56:15.960
this is did you lose a sock did you lose a sock welcome to orange lounge radio I

56:15.960 --> 56:21.360
don't recognize that name it's very cool a longtime podcast listener first time

56:21.360 --> 56:27.560
listening live. Very cool, well welcome. Welcome to the madness. Thank you, appreciate it.

56:27.560 --> 56:33.840
I just wanted to call in and say awesome show, loved it, and that I think it's stupid that

56:33.840 --> 56:42.080
people think Mac gaming is going to die. That Mac gaming is going to die? Oh because of

56:42.080 --> 56:46.920
the whole dual booth thing? Yeah I think people are stupid thinking that it will die, I don't

56:46.920 --> 56:47.540
think it will

56:47.540 --> 56:52.240
I don't think it will you know what Commodore 64 gaming is still not dead in

56:52.240 --> 56:53.680
many ways so

56:53.680 --> 56:57.600
Mac gaming will never die either you know there's there's rabid fans for

56:57.600 --> 56:58.320
everything and

56:58.320 --> 57:01.720
I don't think the dual boot thing is gonna take off right away

57:01.720 --> 57:05.000
it's gonna be a little while I think there's still be some good stuff on Mac

57:05.000 --> 57:09.280
yeah with the with the switch to the Intel processor

57:09.280 --> 57:13.320
I think actually porting games will make it a lot easier so

57:13.320 --> 57:16.720
I think we're gonna see more games on the Mac

57:16.720 --> 57:19.840
Very, uh, we'll see what happens.

57:19.840 --> 57:24.200
I hope so. Alright, anything else? Mr. Sock?

57:24.200 --> 57:29.000
Oh, keep up the good work. Alright. Thank you very much. We appreciate the ego boost call

57:29.000 --> 57:29.640
once in a while.

57:29.640 --> 57:33.000
Okay. Alright, have a good one. We like new people.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.920
Love it when new people call in the show. Alright, let's go to another call here.

57:36.920 --> 57:38.240
We'll go over

57:38.240 --> 57:42.320
here. Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Hey, what's up?

57:42.320 --> 57:46.640
Hi, who's this? Uh, this is Hitstun. Hi, Hitstun. What's on your mind?

57:46.640 --> 57:50.920
mine hello um yeah I got a couple things I want to go over here okay I want to

57:50.920 --> 57:58.880
throw out idea I noticed earlier today about well earlier this week about how

57:58.880 --> 58:02.940
Walmart dictates the contents of games like I posted this up well I saw was

58:02.940 --> 58:12.400
posted on the forums too but like they can dictate things like I know it's cool

58:12.400 --> 58:15.400
I know what article you're talking about and for some reason yeah yeah for some

58:15.400 --> 58:19.640
reason it didn't make this week's show roll but I do remember reading something

58:19.640 --> 58:24.880
on it like Walmart is when a double-a title comes out Walmart supposedly gets

58:24.880 --> 58:30.440
to review the title before it's released yeah I you know why I don't I think one

58:30.440 --> 58:33.800
reason we kind of didn't originally intend on covering it is because I don't

58:33.800 --> 58:39.760
know if I believe it um well I can explain okay go for it it's like they

58:39.760 --> 58:43.120
only have so much shelf space like they only have room for so many adventure

58:43.120 --> 58:46.600
games, so many RPGs, so many strategy games, whatever.

58:46.600 --> 58:48.400
And if something isn't popular enough,

58:48.400 --> 58:50.800
they're not going to have the room to carry it.

58:50.800 --> 58:52.640
So I had an idea.

58:52.640 --> 58:54.640
There should be an independent publisher that's

58:54.640 --> 58:55.600
like Cafe Press.

58:55.600 --> 58:58.560
You know how Cafe Press does like t-shirts and coffee

58:58.560 --> 59:00.400
mugs and stuff, or whoever.

59:00.400 --> 59:00.920
Right.

59:00.920 --> 59:03.040
You send them a design and they make it.

59:03.040 --> 59:05.400
Someone should do that for video games.

59:05.400 --> 59:06.720
That's my idea.

59:06.720 --> 59:09.400
Stamp your video game on a 360?

59:09.400 --> 59:10.120
Yeah, exactly.

59:10.120 --> 59:12.040
Anyone who wants to publish their game

59:12.040 --> 59:16.200
should be able to send it to this company and have people order it from this site and

59:16.200 --> 59:17.200
get copies of it.

59:17.200 --> 59:19.200
I think I blowed this whole thing wide open.

59:19.200 --> 59:22.760
Look, people out there wanting to start a business, you need to give Hitstun a call.

59:22.760 --> 59:24.600
He's got a good idea here.

59:24.600 --> 59:30.720
Now I'm hoping, here's the problem though, would these games break after I put them through

59:30.720 --> 59:31.920
the wash one time?

59:31.920 --> 59:35.480
Because that's what happens to all that shit I buy from Cafe E-Press, is they fucking break

59:35.480 --> 59:37.000
one time after the wash.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
Touche.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.880
I don't know about that, Vee.

59:39.880 --> 59:44.720
I still have a copy of that Bimani t-shirt. You must hand wash that baby or listen

59:46.640 --> 59:53.100
Here is why Walmart knew how they dictate games. Okay, so you have this game coming out called. Halo 3

59:53.420 --> 59:56.520
Yeah, does it have hunting deer in it?

59:57.320 --> 59:59.960
It doesn't we don't want to carry it. I

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.520
Don't buy music at Walmart because I don't agree with this

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:11.360
I just I really don't shop at Walmart in general because I'm such a target whore for one and I just think Walmart is nasty

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:15.040
I mean, I don't know about the Walmart's in your neck of the woods, but around here. They're nasty

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:21.280
You walk in and it smells like dirt. I mean you live in Alabama Walmart's the primary source of entertainment. I

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:27.400
Know I understand I understand that in some areas Walmart's only option. I'm not joking, but you guys have online

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:32.840
Yeah, it's a nice independent stores here. All right. Well, that's good. Like here to call this area and one more thing

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:39.120
Hmm, I I need to pwn you guys a Tetris DS any of you with Tetris DS

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:43.280
Like listen in the chat or I know sky you got it. I

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:49.960
Take you out. Let's let's plan it some more make a thread in the forums and we'll plan a night. All right. Yeah

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.640
I mean

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.760
Yeah, whatever. I'm not like unbeatable or anything, but and I gotta take you guys out. It'll be fun

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.080
We like to we like to show our listeners just how bad at video games

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:06.140
We really are so but I know you guys can turn around and kill me Mario

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:10.400
Well, we'll dish it out at some point start a thread in the forums. We'll try to make it happen

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.280
All right. All right. Have a good one, buddy

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.400
Bye. Bye. Okay. Okay, Rhonda saying he heard heard my accent. I

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.800
Don't have an accent since I moved to California talking about Walmart nonetheless. That's one more art

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.920
All right. Thank you guys so much for calling in on the Skype line tonight

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.820
we appreciate it, but we gotta get to the last minute stories. Does anybody have a

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:33.700
last minute story they'd like to share?

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:38.400
Yeah, Project Gotham 3 is getting an update on Xbox Live.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:43.540
Basic stuff that they're going to be adding, one of them is

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:48.560
the ability to lock the host car and host car class.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:53.220
So again, just what kind of car class you're racing as. Also,

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.440
added wheel support for some of these brand new

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.600
steer wheels out there being put out by like uh... mad cats and

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.040
and stuff like that uh... also

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.240
finally

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.920
uh... they're going to be doing

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:10.280
spectator mode

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.880
uh... so i know that

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.360

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.760
that on your list

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.240
maybe

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:31.160
uh... and then also um... credit for the recent stories has been delayed to the

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.880
end of may supposedly

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.500
i hope that's not true because

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:38.180

everybody's ass

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.800
ever heard of one of the videos that we had me drunk

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.780
hey how about a game of you know uh... credit auto right now michael fucking

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.020

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.120
even if i have drunk

01:02:54.120 --> 01:03:00.120
There were 5,400 World of Warcraft players banned.

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.120
Oh my gosh, what did they do?

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.120
Basically, they were trying to clamp down on gold farming and cheating.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.120
And funeral party raiding.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:16.120
10,700 accounts were suspended for participating in activities that violate the game's terms of use,

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:20.120
including using third-party programs to farm gold and items.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.680
According to Blizzard, and I quote, such actions can severely impact the economy of a realm

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.520
and the overall game enjoyment for all players.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.920
And selling World of Warcraft content such as gold items and characters can result in

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:32.920
permanent ban of the involved accounts.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.160
If you want to cheat like that, you better go play Oblivion.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:41.900
However, a new patch, 1.10.1, is released.

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:46.760
The Jagged Obsidian Shield is now bind on equipped, and the Titanic Leggings pattern

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.480
and will now drop slightly less frequently,

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.680
which is obviously, you know,

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.240
it's gonna make, you know, the item a bit more.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.120
You know the amazing Extrofer hit 60

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.920
on his character on World of Warcraft this week.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.200
Dear God, I'm still level seven.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.520
I haven't even reviewed my account.

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.080
And I was like, what are you gonna do now?

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.440
And he's like, I'm gonna go on raids,

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.200
and I'm gonna do all this fun stuff with my character

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.440
that they wouldn't let me do before,

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.460
because I wasn't 60, and I come in the next day,

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:11.960
and I notice there's an experience bar

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.800
at the bottom of the screen.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.000
I'm like, you're not playing your character.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:22.300
like yeah I got bored so I'm leveling my alt a little bit more news 1.11 is

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:27.860
coming out soon which is basically made specific there'll be a talent review

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:36.100
patch is going to introduce a new 40 man raid dungeon the necropolis of Naxxramas

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:42.500
and which is home to the dreaded lich unpronounceable name insert here all

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:50.500
There's also a little bit more. Capcom's gonna be loading us with stuff at E3 and you know what, I hate Firefox all of a sudden.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.500
What, did it do a crash on you?

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.500
Yes!

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:53.500
Oh no!

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:54.500
So let's see if I can get around this.

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:55.500
I can do a story-

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.500
Just go ahead and leave it off of there.

01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:59.500
Alright, I can do a fill in real quick if you get to bring it up.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.500
Nah, I'm not even gonna bother with it.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:02.500
Alright.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:09.500
Go Nintendo has an interesting little quote from Ubisoft Montreal CEO's Yanis Mallet.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:16.540
I can say definitely as any other developer. We are looking at this magical platform, and we want to be a part of the adventure

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:20.740
I'm pretty sure we'll see other revolution games from Ubisoft and some of them

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:25.160
I'm sure will be made from Montreal, so he's quoting there that the revolution is a

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:28.180
magical platform, it's full of

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.660
Magic and they're going to make magic games

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:38.360
She can play as fairies and magic!

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.360
Can I get a puppy?

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:49.160
You can do anything on the magic of Nintendo!

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.240
That's it.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.040
That's pretty much going to do it for tonight's show.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.240
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.440
Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?

01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:00.620
I want a rabbit that's as big as a dog.

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:04.020
My final thought is, I want a dog that's as big as a rabbit.

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:05.020
Spike.

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.660
Die, monster.

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:09.180
You don't belong in this world.

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:10.180
And...

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:14.860
It was not by my hand that I was given flesh.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:15.860
Nerds!

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:16.860
Nerds!

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.860
Loki.

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:18.860
Um...

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:19.860
Well...

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:22.860
Ooh, video.

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:23.860
We'll have to...

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:26.060
I'm really trying to get this on the website.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:27.060
Alright.

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.980
You do that, Mr. Loki.

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:32.820
Alright, that's going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:37.700
Thank you guys so much for downloading us, checking us out, tuning in live, breaking

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.740
some record numbers for us listening live tonight.

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.060
I really, really appreciate that you guys.

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:46.860
Again, all we ask if you enjoy the show, we do it for free, just tell a friend, tell somebody

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:50.700
you know about Orange Lounge Radio because that's really the best way for us to advertise

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:56.460
because we don't have any big sites backing us and we don't have those ads and things

01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:00.580
so unless Loki can manage to leak some more release dates we don't get

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:03.420
attention very often so we need you guys to help us out

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:07.780
Dark Sakura? I almost forgot reject false icons

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.820
oh there you go and on that note that's gonna do it

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:14.540
