37691	38271	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
66072	66492	Last week?
66752	67153	Last week.
67273	70094	I literally couldn't move, so I had to give blood.
70635	73676	But you made quite the turnaround because you were out rocking out last night, right?
75838	80160	Well, I started feeling better by Monday, and then Tuesday I felt a lot better, and Wednesday I was back at work.
81441	84482	I even did my show on Tuesday, even though I said I wasn't going to.
84723	88645	Did you hear me joking in the last podcast that you were playing hooky so you could stay home and play Kingdom Hearts 2?
90383	91224	You're not far off.
91524	92104	No, I'm kidding.
92365	94927	I actually did play a whole lot of Kingdom Hearts.
105997	108158	People in the chatroom are saying I sound all stuffed up.
109158	112460	That's slightly true because you know it is springtime and I have allergies.
113000	120683	But when in fact I was actually up until 4.30am because I went to see the most amazing live band ever.
121563	122044	Which was?
122144	122744	Babyland.
122904	124625	I finally get to see Babyland live.
124685	125445	I'm so happy.
125765	129887	Because all the other bands were like Suck, Suck, More Suck, and then the Mormons.
130834	131935	I miss Ninja Academy.
131955	132876	8-Bit was cool.
133696	140501	We went outside for, because I went with a guano girl and she went to go have a smoke and we were outside.
141462	150649	While we were outside, this is video game related by the way, I hear this bass line because they're sort of like kind of weird rap, you know, group, but they're wearing hazmat suits too.
151209	157314	But I hear this bass line that sounds familiar and it turns out that it's the Zelda music as a bass line.
158621	159001	That's cool.
159422	160142	It was pretty cool.
160262	163365	I mean, I wouldn't listen to 8-Bit all the time, but their music was pretty cool.
163485	164806	Maybe we should get them on the show at some point.
165226	165526	Maybe.
165987	168148	But Babyland owned the stage.
168349	169990	I was bouncing and jumping.
171191	172011	We get out of there at like 1.30.
172272	175674	I get home at 3.30 and, you know, of course I date my live journal.
177896	178657	Like a true addict.
178757	179437	Like a true addict.
179517	180218	I have photos.
180298	182780	I will be sharing photos with our chat room tonight.
183681	184121	But, um...
185086	186287	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
216297	217458	PSP Silent Hill
243953	244473	How about that?
245735	250559	The source is self-styled online radio station Orange Lounge Radio.
252401	253221	Never heard of that.
253242	254282	I don't know anything about that.
254343	255323	A bunch of no-names over there.
255984	257145	Let's see, the official story.
257485	260868	Apparently Konami reps had not returned requests for comment on this.
261009	263551	Ooh, sounds pretty interesting.
263631	265413	I'm calling April Fool's.
265453	267575	I totally think they're lying.
268564	270064	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
293348	301391	People took notice this week when it crowed that it had uncovered a slew of unannounced games and ship dates courtesy of a leaked list Konami had sent to retailers.
309238	311781	They basically send it to anybody who sells games.
312001	314103	We probably get some sort of information like this.
314244	314824	Very interesting.
315865	316827	And blah, blah, blah.
316867	320231	They talk about the titles that this website decided to announce.
320491	323715	DDR Supernova is going to happen on September 13th.
324055	327019	Dance Dance Revolution Universe on October 11th.
327079	328540	DDR Ultramix 4 on November 14th.
329501	332523	Castlevania, Portrait of Ruin on November 15th.
332563	334145	By the way, that's Portrait, not Portal.
334345	334705	Sorry, guys.
334965	337087	Portrait of Ruin.
337907	342350	And then PSP, Silent Hill, Original Sin on October 18th.
342891	349996	Although very interesting, because I seem to recall this website had a giant disclaimer that said all these dates are subject to change, as release dates always do.
350576	350696	Yeah.
350997	351197	Yeah.
351277	351837	Oh, whatever.
351857	352498	Yeah.
353243	357765	Let's see, and then of course two new Death Junior games, but people don't seem to care as much about those.
358125	360426	And then I thought this was interesting too.
360726	364928	This list also promises a potentially very lucrative tie-in for Konami.
365388	370890	According to Orange Lounge Radio, the list has Karaoke Revolution American Idol arriving in stores on November 15th.
371310	377933	If true, the game would be the second one based on the mega popular television series after Codemasters dismally reviewed 2003 game.
379213	384556	Never mind that Konami already announced back in October that they were going to do the American Idol franchise.
385176	386777	I know because we covered it on this program.
387017	388838	But, you know, it still is a rumor.
388878	390259	It's a dirty rumor at this point.
390839	392340	Who actually listens to us?
392460	392900	I forgot.
393440	394641	Nobody knows of Orange Launch Radio.
394661	396362	They've been low-key for the past few years.
396702	396942	All right.
397933	398494	Orange Lounge Radio
419301	422308	But somehow, that whole time, we've managed to be Loki.
422348	425816	So our longtime fans, you know, you've been a part of something for a long time.
425836	426959	I've always been Loki.
426979	427961	Yeah, you've always been Loki.
429076	429636	No, shut up.
453732	456794	I mean, Castlevania was such a kickass game on the DS.
457134	459156	Of course there was going to be another DS game coming.
459556	461858	The Silent Hill remake has been running around.
461878	462738	That was a rumor.
463359	464780	We covered that, what, three weeks ago?
464800	473626	They talked about, well, they were going to make, other than the Silent Hill experience, they were going to be doing a PSP game anyway, so it's like, okay.
473646	480510	And there was a speculation given from some other commentary about them remaking based on the movie.
481411	482752	Remaking the first game based on the movie.
483235	486337	And of course, DDR is going to have home releases this year.
486357	488057	Like they're not going to release it at home.
488198	488698	I'm sorry.
488838	495381	Never mind the fact that when they were advertising Supernova, they said that it's going to have some connectivity to home versions.
496902	499383	I mean, obviously, there's got to be a new home version coming out.
499803	501064	So I don't know.
501124	502885	Do we really deserve all this notoriety?
502945	505266	Why do people care so much about this story?
505886	507407	Because people like release dates.
508367	509768	Because we beat them to it.
509928	511649	Even though release dates are always subject to change.
512208	512609	Exactly.
512669	513811	They're always subject to change.
513891	522423	So, I mean, by the time we get down to it, well, you know, to be honest, the DDR releases, I'm not too surprised on because they release DDR about the same time every year.
522824	527631	I mean, you get the Xbox version, you know, sometime in November, you know, usually the first half.
528266	530628	and the PS2 version sometime in September.
531149	532650	So it's the same time every year.
533151	536193	Well, I found the whole fallout over this story very fascinating.
536253	543220	I think the part that fascinated me most wasn't the notoriety itself, because I understand people care about Silent Hill and Castlevania and DDR.
543660	546242	All three of them have very rabid fan bases, but what surprised me
547023	549726	was the reaction on the internet out there to these stories.
550146	555852	It's really funny because when DDR Freak, Bomani Style, those sites picked up the story, it was reported as fact.
556492	563699	But when other sites, bigger name sites, picked this up, it was reported as rumor, which I thought was very, very interesting.
563739	564680	And you bring up a good point.
564861	566522	Are people just upset that we beat them to it?
567743	568104	I don't know.
569733	571594	Now, remind us, Loki, where did this come from?
571674	573454	It's just a list that goes out?
573594	580496	Okay, this information got sent to our buyer, the person that maintains our item database.
580976	584657	This was sent to us and entered into our item database.
585178	589219	I merely get a report every now and then when they change dates.
589579	593200	It's basically a date change report, and I notice Bomberman Act 0.
594008	594528	Xbox 360, PSP
619025	619425	DarkSakura,
642361	653168	I don't know, release dates to me are not really a big deal, but I just thought it was interesting because there's a lot of these games that we knew were coming out anyways, and now that we had dates, it's kind of making them more official.
653348	656510	Also kind of gives you an idea of what they're going to be showing at E3 this year.
656551	656931	Wait, hold on.
657011	658492	Oh, I thought you were going to say some more stuff.
658892	659893	Hold that thought for a minute, though.
659993	660113	No.
660213	671941	Because, okay, here's the interesting thing, because what I thought was interesting about the reaction is that people didn't believe it when it was on our site, but when somebody else, one of the big name sites reported it, then,
672401	673884	It was validated.
674124	674745	It was true.
675686	676387	Guess what, guys?
676928	680494	Those big sites all copied from our list.
681575	682557	And here's the proof.
683237	690961	The proof is, is that when these websites ran a story that said Konami leaked information or whatever, they listed the same dates we did.
691502	696464	But what we didn't tell you was, Loki only posted the games he thought you'd want to know about, right?
696604	697065	Exactly.
697305	702648	So a website that would have found this about Konami games would have picked up the other
703308	709855	Lower name titles that maybe we didn't think you originally wanted to know about, but now, after all this fear, we guess you do want to know about.
710275	710436	Yeah.
710716	714160	So, Loki, what are some other Konami games that were on this list?
715141	716742	For example, Rengoku 2.
717603	720766	You know what's really sad is I actually played Rengoku last E3.
721567	725992	I actually brought it with me on my PSP, and I love this game, except it was really boring.
726550	729932	But for whatever reason, Rengoku 2 is coming out in July 12th.
730312	731612	That's what's slated for right now.
731672	736074	About the same time I... No, actually, I think Rengoku came out later than that last year.
736114	739176	Anyways, yeah, okay game, I guess.
740657	741857	Goddamn screensaver.
742798	744959	I fucking hate these stupid... That's why you turned them off.
745919	746860	But I like the fishies.
747100	751982	Anyways, on top of that, we've also got... Let's see here.
752458	753179	If you're a Yu-Gi-Oh!
753219	754800	fan, there's going to be lots of stuff for you.
754860	755640	You've got Yu-Gi-Oh!
755940	758462	GX Tag Force coming out on the PSP.
758562	759903	That's in November 15th.
761164	766508	Shaolin Showdown, which is apparently based on some anime show that's, I think, on the WB or whatever.
767108	774173	Coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, PSP, and I think DS.
775073	777195	And that one's coming out on November 15th.
779776	781817	Online Chess Kingdoms PSP.
782457	783857	I am so looking forward to that.
784877	786178	Also November 15th.
787778	788038	Nerd.
788318	791219	Winx Club Quest for Codex.
791659	792119	Ah, the Winx.
792299	794340	That was last year's E3 for me.
794360	796520	Standing in Konami's booth jamming to that Winx song.
796580	798481	That you know that song frightens me.
800341	803282	It's stuck in my head from last year's E3 being at that booth.
803322	804342	It's an infectious song.
804382	804942	Don't mess with me.
805382	807983	Well anyways, Winx Club Quest for Codex.
809175	816919	That's going to be coming out, looks like, October 25th, along with Steel Horizon on the PSP, which I believe is a naval warfare game.
818040	820601	Then there's a Marvel trading card game, to be honest.
820621	821362	Is this all Konami?
821522	822402	It's all Konami.
822623	827125	Marvel trading card games coming out on the PSP, and I want to say the DS.
828386	829326	So that should be interesting.
829346	832528	I guess they're trying to, you know, I guess since Yu-Gi-Oh!
832568	834109	is popular, they're trying some other stuff here.
835930	837591	And... I want to say, I think
838568	842493	Gradius Collections coming out next month, June 14th, but I knew that for a while.
843113	846217	Demon Chaos coming out next month.
848699	852824	Lunar Knights Vampire Hunt is going to be coming out November 15th.
852844	853164	All right.
854543	856044	and I think that's about it.
856304	858026	Wake me up when we get a Goemon game.
858666	866412	Now, what I think is interesting about this is that, you know, and if Konami, anybody from Konami is listening and is ticked off about this, please don't be.
866752	873958	We're just repeating information that's already been put out there into the retailers and we figure, well, since retailers know about this, you know, maybe the gamers want to know about this too.
874838	879522	Well, it's the same thing like when other websites post a goddamn list from GameStop.
879702	881123	Those are internalists that they actually...
882241	890625	And to lessen the blow a little bit, do you have anything from another game company that people might want to know about?
890705	891386	Hell yeah, we do.
892706	893246	Anyways, no.
894447	897048	Let's take a look-see here, some stuff maybe later on this year.
897328	900510	Well, for example, this is not in any order.
901210	907073	Anyways, for example, there was some games, actually they announced open season, I think, this week as well.
907894	911237	That was one of the ones that's going to be based on, I think, a DreamWorks movie or something like that.
911257	914740	Some animated movie about animals getting back at hunters or something.
915520	917742	But that's coming out in the fall.
919063	920144	I do have, what was it?
920244	922866	Oh, what was a really cool one here?
924367	924868	Oh, here's one.
926889	930272	Nintendo DS, SNK vs. Capcom Cardfighter.
930392	934075	It's going to be coming out on, looks like, October 2nd.
934375	935156	Hey, that's awesome.
936562	937643	Cartoon Network Racing
963204	964224	October 18th.
964464	965684	Hey, there's Dance Factory.
965724	967545	That game's been delayed forever.
967645	969345	Yeah, it sucked.
969485	970865	A game based on the movie Cars?
970945	972586	Is that what that is on June 7th there?
973106	975306	Yeah, that's... Oh, what was that?
975366	975846	Naruto.
975886	978187	I bet a lot of our listeners that like anime want to know about that.
978407	982247	They actually are bringing out the... I've known about this for a little while.
982267	984228	They're bringing out one of the last Naruto games.
984828	986428	Naruto Ultimate Ninja.
986448	987688	That's coming out June 21st.
989209	991389	What was a really funny one I saw here?
992335	993756	Anything that people might not know about yet?
994116	996837	PS2, Yakuza, it's coming out September 13th.
997117	998737	I know that was one that was pretty cool.
999638	1002259	I'm trying to think of some really cool stuff.
1002599	1004159	Well, it's coming out way later in the year there.
1005660	1007261	I wish this was in order here.
1007541	1009161	Oh, there's a bunch of 360 games.
1010002	1012002	Dead Rising, I think the date's wrong on that, though.
1012863	1013963	I think it got postponed.
1014003	1015104	We haven't updated it yet.
1017344	1018745	Overgy Fighters, that looks kind of cool.
1019767	1021848	Nova G Fighters is June 8th there?
1022088	1022808	Yeah, June 8th.
1024008	1025248	Splinter Cell, Double Agent?
1025569	1026229	That's September.
1026809	1030630	They got postponed a while back because they didn't think there was enough systems out there.
1031510	1033451	Snoopy vs. the Red Baron, August 16th.
1033471	1035491	We covered that one.
1038871	1039371	Yeah, I know.
1039952	1041133	Alright, so there you have it.
1041553	1051360	There's, and this is, this stuff is all, you know, subject to change, I mean, a lot of stuff they announce way in advance and gets pushed back and back and back and back and, yeah.
1052040	1055203	But, um, I don't know, there's some, some good stuff.
1055583	1062087	Um, Mega Man ZX, um, coming out September 13th on the Game Boy Advance.
1064109	1064409	I don't know.
1066210	1067971	So, yeah, lots of exciting stuff.
1068492	1068592	Um,
1069628	1071269	More, of course, coming from E3.
1072069	1075991	Granted, I mean, we might see stuff at E3 that, you know, wasn't on the Konami list.
1076031	1076651	Oh, absolutely.
1077051	1077711	I'm sure there will be.
1078031	1083374	I mean, for example, we don't have any Revolution or PS3 titles in here yet.
1083434	1085674	And there was nothing on Metal Gear 4, right?
1085755	1089356	Which, you know, we know Konami's planning, but they don't have a date for it yet, obviously.
1089376	1089796	Exactly.
1089856	1092077	So, lots of stuff coming.
1092777	1095979	And, you know, I'll just keep an eye out on these dates.
1096039	1099340	You know, if we see anything good, I'll definitely, you know,
1099761	1101222	Keep guys up to date on this stuff.
1102583	1103463	Alright, sounds great.
1104084	1107026	Our Skype line is open if anyone wants to give us a call.
1107206	1110828	Most specifically about this topic here is what we want you guys' feedback on.
1111088	1113510	What do you think about this whole news story?
1113590	1114771	Do you think we're full of crap?
1115471	1118213	Which I hope by this point you don't, but if you do, then say so.
1118273	1120094	We'll offer our witty retorts.
1121195	1124597	Did we ruin E3?
1124677	1125377	I don't think we did.
1125417	1126838	I think we built hype for E3.
1126958	1128639	To be honest, if anything, this...
1130543	1136286	Who out there, I mean, other than probably us, actually goes to E3 looking to see what Konami's putting out?
1136366	1142709	I mean, I know everybody's interested in all the companies and stuff, but, I mean, the big focus this year is going to be PS3, Revolution.
1143110	1148793	I think the fact that we put out the dates, maybe if anything, kind of helped.
1149713	1150073	I don't know.
1151014	1151914	It's only two weeks away.
1151934	1155156	I mean, it's like, you know, it's not a huge spoiler.
1155176	1156797	I don't know.
1157870	1165096	All right, so no calls coming in on the Skype line right now, but our chat room is kind of a buzz here over at www.orangelantradio.com.
1165116	1165716	Click on chat.
1166377	1169099	We have Ranma says, Naruto GameCube sucks.
1169339	1174063	Naruto PS2 owns, or I should say pones, so to speak.
1176085	1180348	Dark Knight wants to know, oh my God, they're going to port the Neo Geo Pocket game.
1180388	1182450	I wonder if that's in reference to the Capcom SNK.
1183480	1186703	Naruto 2 is coming out on GameCube October 18th
1210353	1211616	Current Gen stuff as well.
1211936	1215544	They're going to be ported into PSP, PS2, Xbox.
1216826	1217187	Awesome.
1219171	1220173	Alright, sounds pretty good.
1221457	1221937	All right.
1222017	1231381	Well, since it looks like people are being shy in our chat room right now, not wanting to give us a call, we'll open up Skype line a little later for other topics if you guys want to call in and talk about that.
1231401	1237024	But for now, we'll go ahead and move on and talk about our gaming week, how we usually start off the show.
1238304	1240105	DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week?
1240385	1242226	Kingdom Hearts and lots of it.
1243846	1244527	Oh, my God.
1244567	1248829	I've played just like I was so in a hurry to get past all the Roxas crap.
1250362	1251362	I hear that's a fun part of the game.
1251382	1252162	What's his face, the guitar boy?
1252182	1253683	He's a pain in the ass to beat.
1280257	1286823	I've been playing a lot of that, and not really much else, just because it puts me back in couch potato mode.
1287704	1292449	I played a little bit of Ragnarok, but I was like, eh, I don't really feel like trying to get to level 50 today.
1293770	1299296	So that's really been about all I've been playing, is lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of Kingdom Hearts.
1300156	1302579	Alright, I hear it's a very time-consuming game.
1304386	1305827	I haven't touched my copy in a week.
1334210	1339855	I picked a different name because I just wanted some anonymity on playing Final Fantasy XI.
1340715	1343638	But there is a Skye on there, but it's a she and it's not me.
1344318	1345199	I have a different name on there.
1345239	1355627	But I've ran into a lot of really nice people on that server and some people that are helping me level my way to level 30 so I can get some of those advanced jobs because I kind of want to be a puppet master in Final Fantasy XI.
1355647	1356048	That'll rock.
1356648	1359110	As far as other games, I've been playing a whole lot of new stuff.
1359510	1362153	I ordered Beatmania 2DX Nightstyle.
1363272	1366634	like last week and I finally got it this week so I've been playing a little bit of that.
1367294	1382643	Beatmania's release here in the USA really got me back into playing that and outside of that I also decided to download Mutant Storm Reloaded, the game on Xbox Live Arcade after seeing it at Loki's house the other day and it's interesting because it's very similar to Geometry Wars but it's not.
1383203	1388726	It's like the stages aren't all that same square and it's a pretty game but not in the same way.
1389207	1391288	It's very sci-fi looking and
1392068	1392989	Pulsing Cells
1412179	1413901	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1433340	1456330	and that pretty much does it for my gaming week I mean Final Fantasy XI eats up a lot of my time I have other games that I'm waiting to try like Spike brought some games that he wanted me to try out and I got a copy of Oblivion but for the computer and I want to be checking that out pretty soon as well so one of my friends is letting me borrow his copy of Oblivion so that'll be good I wanted to add something what's that?
1457070	1458691	I really really hate the Little Mermaid levels
1459620	1461022	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1483615	1487457	MiniMe283 says, I love that Penny Arcade comic about Kingdom Hearts 2.
1488137	1489857	I unfortunately didn't see that one.
1489877	1490918	I was hoping maybe you'd seen it.
1491138	1491938	Yes, I have.
1492138	1494099	It's Winnie the Pooh merging with Sephiroth.
1494139	1495459	Oh, wait, I did see that.
1495920	1496800	Yeah, I did see that.
1497320	1497900	Oh, that was funny.
1500041	1501382	So Sephiroth's in this one, too?
1502402	1504783	Yeah, and he's not, what's his face anymore?
1504963	1506363	Lance Bass from NSYNC?
1506943	1508304	Yeah, but...
1509619	1511880	Whoever is Aerith sounds like she's stoned.
1512700	1514161	Mina Savari from American Beauty.
1514821	1515581	She sucks.
1515621	1516742	I don't like her in that.
1516802	1518302	And she's going to be her in Advent Children.
1518782	1520783	I would have rather had Mandy Moore in that saying something.
1521864	1525365	But she's like, oh, I'm on drugs.
1527285	1528246	Want to get high?
1529926	1531147	Loki, what have you been playing this week?
1532047	1534928	Well, I've been playing Mutant Storm Reloaded.
1535028	1537249	I played that last night, and that was fun.
1538916	1539816	I'm getting tangled here.
1540377	1542997	And I was also playing more Oblivion.
1543878	1544638	And that's really cool.
1545358	1545978	And I'm cheating.
1546639	1547279	That's even better.
1548239	1549240	I did an item dupe.
1550600	1553121	So I have all the uber stuff now.
1554061	1554822	It was kind of neat though.
1554842	1561244	I got this really magic enhanced katana and I took off someone's head with it and it was cool.
1562464	1566266	Tried to kill a horse and people didn't like that very much.
1568891	1570212	But, what else?
1570992	1578195	I played Rumble Roses XX, and... I've been playing with the photo-taking mode.
1578615	1581676	No, I did create a character, though, and it looked pretty cool.
1581996	1587399	You don't get much to start off with, but it's really neat how they do, like, the different... how customizable it is.
1588119	1592101	I did make a character that looked like Miss Swan from Mad TV.
1592141	1594181	I was gonna say, you were telling me about Miss Swan.
1594221	1595522	I wish you could have seen this.
1595982	1597003	That was hilarious.
1597803	1597903	Um...
1599562	1600123	Actually, the Ms.
1600163	1607170	Swan character, all you have to do is basically take the default character that they give you and just make her fat and she looks like Ms.
1607210	1607591	Swan.
1608432	1610394	So, I don't know.
1610834	1612536	And then, what else did I do?
1612716	1616060	I actually... Apparently...
1616886	1618747	I played Mario Kart GP.
1619568	1622149	I can't tell you anything about it because I don't remember.
1622730	1629394	Yes, Loki's bachelor party was last night and as part of it he got to go to Golf Land to play some Drunken Miniature Golf and some Drunken Mario Kart.
1629434	1629894	I was there.
1630374	1635257	I filmed it and I think it's going to be going up on the website at some point or maybe the MySpace or something.
1635297	1635697	I don't know.
1635978	1639700	We'll have to put it somewhere on one of those sites.
1639740	1642401	We still need more people on our MySpace so maybe we ought to put it over there.
1642902	1643562	We'll put it on both.
1643622	1644463	Put it on YouTube.
1644603	1644723	It's
1646745	1651666	The whole... Drunken A-hole from No Name Site plays Mario Kart Drunk.
1652827	1653567	It was great.
1653947	1659349	I think the best part was, you know how Mario Kart Arcade will take your picture before you start playing?
1659629	1662929	The picture that you did was so friggin' hilarious.
1662990	1663910	I can't even describe it.
1663930	1665210	You guys are going to have to wait for the video.
1665250	1665710	It's great.
1666851	1668631	I'm converting the video tonight.
1669851	1672832	JeremyTodd1 says, put it on olrpsp.com.
1673132	1674793	So, yeah, we're definitely going to be doing that.
1674973	1675633	Yeah.
1676992	1679395	The 23rd Magus says, We need a drunk show.
1680496	1683279	I hate to tell you, but probably not going to happen for a little while.
1683299	1685741	We're going to be somewhere during our next three-day weekend.
1686442	1686722	Yeah.
1687023	1687723	Oh, yeah.
1687883	1690807	The next three-day weekend is... Memorial Day weekend at Fonamay.
1690927	1692288	Yeah, we're doing the panels at Fonamay.
1692308	1693509	So we'd love to meet some of our listeners.
1693730	1694851	Yeah, and like...
1695473	1698935	Like the last really bad drunk show, I did get very sick.
1699235	1705980	There will probably be some drinking at E3 Outpost, because I know we're supposed to be doing that with the folks over at AllGames.com.
1706000	1710843	They've got the little E3Outpost.com, and they're supposed to have a bar, so that might be a good time.
1711063	1712684	That makes me a happy bunny.
1713545	1713965	We'll see.
1714785	1717567	The whole thing is... I don't know.
1718668	1719909	Last night was pretty bad.
1720149	1720369	I mean...
1721627	1722467	It was really bad.
1722487	1724728	What was your bachelor party?
1725528	1726909	I don't remember half of it.
1727369	1729369	I guess that's supposed to happen.
1729749	1735671	But, luckily, even though I can't remember it, we do have it on video.
1735711	1740412	I want to put the Mario Kart thing because I watched that today for the first time and I laughed my ass off.
1740452	1741693	I thought it was hilarious.
1742013	1743833	The face that it made was great.
1745474	1746334	Oh, you're so funny.
1747134	1747354	I know.
1748215	1749055	I was yelling at
1749551	1751632	The Volcano, because I could.
1753493	1759397	Yeah, Milfululi says, and I totally butchered that name, sorry, says that we should put it on WikiQuote.
1760037	1763319	Unfortunately, I think Matt's WikiQuote got VFD'd today.
1763619	1767561	I don't think it's there anymore, so sadness, but no more WikiQuote for us.
1767981	1772064	Now, if somebody wanted to create one under Orange Lounge Radio, they might be able to get away with it this time.
1772104	1772404	I don't know.
1772444	1772744	We'll see.
1774888	1779771	We're too busy converting videos or ourselves on wiki, but we know you guys love the wiki.
1780011	1784513	Then, of course, I did play more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories.
1785713	1786114	It's all good.
1786774	1787074	Awesome.
1787834	1793057	Alright, let's get into some news from a bunch of no-name websites out there that we want to share with you guys.
1793077	1793617	No, I'm kidding.
1794198	1794799	I'm totally kidding.
1795479	1803527	And I thought we'd started off with this story tonight because I think this is very interesting and it's kind of a follow-up to this whole fallout that we were talking about earlier.
1804067	1807310	And whereas people reacted to our news as, who?
1807450	1807971	Who are these guys?
1809272	1811373	This story comes from GameDaily.com.
1811493	1814595	No one watches online video game TV.
1815335	1822318	And basically, it's this report that was done by Forrester Research.
1822679	1831283	And the report found that 25% of online households have expressed interest in podcasting, but only 2% have experimented with audio downloads.
1831663	1836765	And only 1% of households actually got a podcast onto a player.
1838126	1850972	So podcasting is still kind of a very niche thing, and they're saying that, you know, when you consider that PodNova has 55,000 different podcasts available out there, it's still not really catching on.
1851112	1852893	I still say it's too new.
1853334	1857456	I realize podcasting, you know, it's a very trendy thing in the nerd culture right now.
1858176	1860937	I think it's still going to be a little while before we see this catch on.
1861318	1865660	I think videocasting, honestly, is where it's at, and, you know, I'd love to do a...
1866340	1867701	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
1894392	1897875	Something to think about there, online video game TV.
1897895	1900697	Do you guys listen to any other podcasts besides this one?
1902018	1902978	I never have time.
1903198	1904519	I don't even listen to this one.
1904619	1905700	Maybe that's part of it.
1905820	1907982	I listen to a couple, but I wish I could listen to more.
1908102	1910964	I don't like listening to my own voice, so I don't listen to our podcast.
1912265	1912505	Okay.
1912545	1914166	I've just always been like that.
1914186	1914907	It is a little weird.
1915567	1915947	Hey!
1916228	1916888	No, no, not your voice.
1916908	1918289	I'm saying it's a little weird to hear yourself bat.
1918329	1920251	Well, you know, you're weird too, but... Bite me.
1921071	1921912	But no, no...
1923087	1925050	I just kind of get weirded out by that.
1925210	1929595	I just never have any time.
1929875	1932698	I've downloaded a few podcasts.
1932778	1938004	For people I've actually met at the podcast awards, and I've listened to a few others.
1938545	1943771	I try to check out the ones that are out there, but I can't really dedicate any real time to it since I'm in school.
1946307	1949070	We have some comments in the chat room.
1949610	1952233	VXJasonXV says, Video casting is for porn.
1952733	1954134	Gives a little salute emote icon.
1955095	1957217	Ranma says, Bring back the OLR webcam.
1959379	1959639	Maybe.
1959680	1959980	I don't know.
1960060	1963263	We'll see.
1963463	1966626	Some other folks in chat are talking about some of the other shows that they listen to.
1967610	1973954	Some folks that listen to shows over at allgames.com or shows that are affiliated with all games such as Video Game Show.
1974735	1980578	Some folks saying they listen to Dignation, Dream Station CC.
1981138	1984240	I know they sent us something a while ago we played around Christmas time.
1984921	1985901	So very interesting.
1986202	1991325	I think Overnightscape was one of the ones I was listening to off and on because I met the guy who runs it.
1991365	1992946	He interviewed me at the podcast.
1992986	1994166	I remember I actually heard that.
1994186	1994747	It was pretty cool.
1994807	1994967	Yeah.
1995814	1995994	All right.
1996014	1999115	And you had an interview on the All Games podcast, didn't you, on Friday?
1999415	2000676	Yeah, All Games Interactive.
2000716	2000976	Yeah.
2001516	2001936	Good time?
2003857	2004057	Sure.
2005517	2009839	I was, like, in such a rush that day.
2009859	2010959	I don't remember what I was doing.
2010979	2012660	I don't know.
2012840	2013240	That's all right.
2014346	2015967	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2037369	2039589	What is that for defeating the odds?
2039709	2042330	Mine still works too, but I don't have a first gen.
2042390	2044110	I got mine a couple years after it was out.
2044170	2047051	I bought my Japanese PlayStation 2 pretty much just for Beatmania.
2047651	2050772	I picked up a couple other games, but pretty much that's the only one that gets played on it.
2051812	2062014	Well, there's actually reporting from CNN Money, from Chris Morris at CNN Money, stating that the PlayStation 2's price is going to drop.
2063320	2073922	Right now it's at $149, but now that the Xbox 360 is really staying there, it looks like they're going to be dropping the price by about $20.
2076382	2076862	Very cool.
2076942	2081263	So, you know, in light of all these new systems coming out, they're going to be a little more expensive.
2081383	2086124	I think it's, you know, formularic almost that these old consoles drop in price a little bit.
2086344	2088784	So some folks who still don't have a PS2 will be very happy.
2089424	2090465	It's $20, though.
2090605	2092465	I mean, if they really wanted to make it
2093491	2094572	They've already made back their money.
2094992	2097253	They should drop that thing to $99 and clear them out.
2097373	2099314	They just sell a hell of a lot of games that way.
2100195	2102756	I heard a rumor that they're actually talking $99 later.
2103097	2106158	Maybe $99 will come at Christmas when PS3 is already out.
2106579	2111261	I mean, who out there is going, Damn, I'd buy that PS2 if it were only $20 cheaper.
2113974	2116255	Every dollar counts, though, if you're trying to budget out.
2116416	2127202	Not everybody is into games enough to want to buy a GameCube, a PlayStation 2, and an Xbox, never mind the DS, the PSP, and all that other stuff, too.
2127242	2130084	Not everybody is sick like we are and buys all those systems.
2130344	2131285	Not everybody can afford it.
2131625	2136828	I mean, I budget for those types of expenses, but not everybody can do that.
2138449	2139770	Every penny counts.
2140630	2141931	A penny saved is a penny earned.
2143012	2143512	I don't know, whatever.
2144125	2148389	A penny saved is a penny that you already earned that you just set aside.
2148770	2150812	A dollar saved is one you should send to me.
2152373	2155136	That's a phrase that I've never been able to get behind.
2155496	2159941	Just because a penny saved is a penny earned, but you've already earned it, so you didn't earn it twice.
2160561	2161582	I mean, what's up with that?
2162343	2163724	Pennies aren't worth anything anyways.
2163944	2167508	Could you get behind the dollar saved is a dollar you should send to Orange Launch Radio?
2168613	2171716	It already says in my intro to pump up the volume to send me a dollar.
2172176	2173677	Two people have sent me a dollar.
2173997	2174498	For real?
2174818	2175398	I didn't know that.
2175418	2177720	Two people have mailed me a dollar bill.
2178301	2178921	Where's the cut?
2179261	2179762	That's awesome.
2179822	2180903	Yeah, where's our cut?
2181743	2185767	It was invested into the show to give me beer.
2186047	2186927	Oh, okay, fair enough.
2186948	2188709	That increases my entertainment value.
2190350	2193773	Loki, for those folks... That bottle of fat tire that's in my fridge.
2194628	2200732	Loki, for those folks who are ready to graduate to the PlayStation 3 and can't freaking wait for it, what's the latest on PlayStation 3?
2201232	2204754	Well, you'll get to play it at E3 this year, which is awesome.
2205815	2206975	Except you've got to wait in line.
2207656	2208156	A long line.
2208416	2210557	A very, very, very, very, very long line.
2211198	2219102	So basically, yeah, it will be there, but it's going to be pretty much like the PSP was when they first showed that a couple years ago.
2219843	2220403	Long line.
2221175	2225242	Sony and Nintendo love to do the long line to play something.
2225362	2228267	I'm sure this year Nintendo is going to have a long line to play The Revolution.
2229580	2231001	Not a big surprise.
2231061	2233002	Hopefully there will be some actual games there.
2233302	2235923	It gives it that exclusive club feeling to it in a way.
2236843	2238864	I got to see the PS3 at E3 and you didn't.
2239625	2240765	One of those things.
2241045	2242866	I didn't wait in line for Zelda last year.
2242946	2255892	I know I'm crazy, but I just felt my three hours I could have waited in line to see Zelda or I could have actually taken time to really look at some of the things in Kenshiya Hall and there's some pretty good gems down there every year.
2255912	2256052	Exactly.
2259057	2260999	Rumor or fact on this PS3 thing?
2261580	2263302	I guess we don't really know until E3, right?
2263482	2266285	I'm going to say probably fact because it makes perfect sense.
2266765	2267826	I mean, look at last year.
2268467	2275234	They even went a step further at Microsoft's booth and they said, hey, you've got to be pressed in order to play the 360, bitch.
2276375	2279778	So just because you deem it fact, then it must be fact, right?
2280579	2281280	I'm speculating.
2281997	2284579	I'm pulling that completely out of my ass.
2284959	2287101	You might remember a classic video game.
2287121	2289363	We're jumping from classic to new, but this is classic.
2290043	2290964	Out of This World.
2290984	2292085	You remember this game, Out of This World?
2292105	2293026	It was released in 1991.
2293406	2296148	I want to say it came out on the Sega Genesis was one of the systems it was on.
2296508	2300411	This was a game I never really got into, but I know it has a really cult following to the game.
2301532	2311000	It was a really nice looking game and used 3D polygon really before it was... This was 1991, and we didn't really have PlayStation and things until...
2311500	2312460	Super Nintendo, baby!
2339406	2340067	How about the whole Sega Ages?
2364989	2366950	I guess this isn't really a new thing to do, but I don't know.
2367250	2373631	Something about this game in particular, seeing as it was more of a small title, it's kind of interesting to see this get re-released.
2373651	2376812	Where the hell's my remade friggin' Blaster Master?
2376832	2381113	You will get your remade Blaster Master when Jamie and I get our remade Guardian Legend.
2381153	2381753	Thank you very much.
2382373	2382773	Drive-thru.
2383033	2385073	Hello, Borderbund, or was it Borderbund?
2385093	2385653	Broderbund.
2385754	2386174	Broderbund?
2386194	2386694	Broderbund?
2386994	2387374	Broderbund?
2387394	2387934	Broderbund?
2393183	2394744	Well-formed squishy buns?
2395225	2396386	Do they even exist anymore?
2396626	2397447	You know what else they made?
2397507	2397847	No.
2397867	2398547	The print shop.
2398868	2399688	Remember the print shop?
2399949	2400149	No.
2400169	2402911	Where you could print those huge, hideous banners on the dot matrix printers?
2402971	2404552	Oh, fuck yeah.
2405453	2407415	And it would take like an hour to print your damn banners?
2407755	2409136	And you had the green and white paper?
2409376	2410017	Wasn't that them?
2410918	2412159	I'm pretty sure that was them.
2412479	2413540	Do you want to know what sucks?
2413620	2420005	Is that my old computer lab at my college had dot matrix printers with the green and white paper.
2422740	2425121	Comments from the chatroom, www.orangeillustrated.com.
2425141	2425701	Click on chat.
2426322	2428783	Lots of celebration around Blaster Master.
2428903	2433645	23rd Magus would like you to know Broderbund also did Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, which is another big title.
2433665	2434065	Yes, they did.
2434925	2435146	All right.
2436126	2441168	Moving on to another story, let's head on over to Loki.
2441788	2442149	Yes.
2442809	2445890	Yes, we have some news on an Xbox Live Arcade game.
2447031	2449152	Actually, I have this game, yet have never played it.
2449352	2451933	Got it for free with one of those 12-month kits.
2452401	2452962	Bankshot Billiards 2
2468326	2469847	on his wonderful podcast.
2491349	2496431	It didn't look like it was something I had to own, but a lot of my friends list is playing it, so I'm like, what am I missing out on?
2496771	2497891	And I like Yahoo Pool.
2499352	2500492	I don't like billiards games.
2500832	2504193	I only have this on my 360 because it's free.
2506014	2506634	That is it.
2507529	2507929	All right.
2508550	2512813	You guys like to send us e-mails once in a while over at www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2512833	2516875	You can send your e-mails to mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2516915	2522739	And when you do so, Dark Sakura will dig through the e-mail and pull out some of her favorites and scold them on air.
2522999	2524520	I have to wear a hazmat suit lately.
2525181	2531245	And last week, Dark Sakura wasn't here, so we did some MySpace messages because people have been sending us messages on MySpace.
2531265	2532306	So we did a couple of those.
2532646	2534127	But we need to catch up on some e-mails.
2534187	2536809	So let's have Dark Sakura get on the suit.
2537649	2541072	Dig in the mailbag and pull out some, hopefully not anthrax.
2541192	2542513	What'd you get?
2544214	2544714	Anthrax!
2546115	2546696	Freeing the noise.
2547776	2548036	Anyway.
2549678	2550959	We have one from Blaze.
2552319	2554241	Hey Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura.
2554381	2555662	Why is my name not first?
2555702	2556222	I mean, gee.
2556803	2557243	Watch it.
2558043	2564388	After hearing the discussion about Kingdom Hearts 2 and the extremely slight chance of an MMORPG, I started thinking about it.
2564847	2573935	In order to avoid having everyone as a Keyblade holder, thus resulting in no bad guy characters, perhaps a movie could introduce an evil Keyblade allowing for a balance of characters.
2574016	2574536	Just a thought.
2575417	2583324	Also, I don't know if anyone still cares anymore, but Microsoft is seriously sending out their Xbox Live Diamond cards as fast as they were putting out the Xbox 360s.
2584005	2587068	Sky, by the way, absolutely loved Need for Speed Most Wanted on my Xbox 360.
2587128	2587948	How dare you bash it?
2588549	2589210	I didn't bash it.
2589250	2589450	Hold on.
2591404	2616513	I may have bashed it and said how horrible looking it is but I also said I couldn't stop playing it for like a whole week and I think that says something that you can have a sometimes there's it's the reason why when games are reviewed by people there's that fun factor that contributes really big to it that's outside of graphics outside of sound outside of all that crap there's fun factor and for whatever reason and I still can't put my finger on it I found that game to be so much fun
2620996	2625497	On the subject of eating healthy while gaming, I will take a six-pack of Propel water.
2625537	2626537	I used to drink that stuff all the time.
2627117	2628818	And drink that instead of a bunch of soda.
2629038	2630018	As always, I love the show.
2630078	2630778	Keep up the good work.
2632438	2632918	That was good.
2633599	2636539	But it got to be a little too sugary for me when I started cutting out a lot of sugar.
2637339	2642060	So now I'm drinking oxygen water, which gives you very clean breath.
2642100	2644501	That sounds like a way to rip you off at the store.
2645021	2647281	It actually was cheaper than the other waters, which is why I bought it.
2647681	2648002	All right.
2648462	2648782	Fair enough.
2649462	2650002	What else do we have?
2652036	2656019	Well, did you already cover the MySpace message from Joey?
2656379	2657700	Yes, that was last week.
2658000	2658960	Well, fine then.
2659000	2661342	Sorry, I... Stealing my thunder.
2661362	2662302	Well, look, you weren't here.
2662463	2663063	Hey, I'm kidding.
2664464	2665384	Yeah, I was in a coma.
2666905	2667846	I was dead at the time.
2667866	2670388	You're going to be back in a coma if you don't start reading some more email messages.
2670408	2671468	Hey, it's rude to point.
2671488	2673790	I'm going to watch out or I'll kick you from chat.
2676772	2677012	Okay.
2677717	2683504	Hey again, I didn't think you'd read my question on your show, let alone when there are two weeks worth of nails to go through.
2683524	2683904	Thanks again.
2695495	2699858	I've gone ahead and picked up Beatmania and have two observations and two questions about it.
2700919	2707523	One, despite being a hopeless, hopeless novice right now, I really prefer 7Key, the 2DX mode over 5Key.
2707964	2714248	The latter seems to only have three level one songs, while 7Key seems to have a better variety of songs suited for all skill levels.
2714969	2718290	Two, you mentioned the overly colorful and techno-trippy interface.
2718390	2721311	To me, what it reminded me of most was Amplitude.
2721471	2725553	Although Harmonic's name doesn't appear on the game, I'm wondering how much involvement the team had on this one.
2725993	2726293	Zero.
2726333	2726653	Zero.
2726953	2727633	It's all Konami.
2728394	2738337	Konami made this game the very first Beatmania was in 98, and I want to say the first 2DX was 2000 or 2001, don't quote me on that, but somewhere in that area.
2738597	2742359	Actually, no wait, Beatmania was probably 97, because DDR first came out in 98, so...
2744693	2745293	Beatmania was 97.
2745734	2747355	Needless to say, they're old.
2747395	2751478	Because the emulator that was the thing at the time was BM98.
2751638	2752979	That's right, that's right.
2753260	2754761	I still have BM98.
2754801	2755081	Why?
2755141	2755622	It sucks.
2756222	2760666	No, it doesn't, because it has all of the neat... Like, the person who did the...
2761838	2762759	The Metal Gear music.
2763059	2763439	Alright.
2763519	2765680	With the, oh no, the truck has started to move.
2766040	2766361	Alright.
2767521	2772864	Speaking of amplitude and sort of frequency, is it possible to use the Beatmania controller with those games?
2772884	2775185	I haven't really tried it, but it seems to make sense doing so.
2775646	2776086	I don't know.
2776366	2782729	I don't think it works because I don't, those seven buttons on your 2DX controller are not like circle, square, remapped.
2783330	2784971	It's a completely different signals.
2785031	2785711	I don't think it works.
2786631	2789553	I think they should, I think Harmonix should have released a controller for those games.
2789573	2790794	I think it would have been a lot of fun, but...
2791565	2792766	The last one.
2792926	2797670	Finally, which of the songs on Beatmania US would you most like to see on DDR Supernova's eventual console port?
2798210	2798931	Just curious.
2799051	2802314	Mr. T and one of the club mixes of 20 November would be my pick.
2802474	2803214	I hate 20 November.
2803755	2803995	Yeah.
2804095	2805636	No, somebody in chat wanted me to say that earlier.
2806197	2808679	20 November's okay, but it's not as great as people say it is.
2809539	2810140	Bad Boy Bass.
2810340	2810680	Hello.
2810860	2811381	I love that song.
2813843	2818987	I'm really not very excited about many of the things that are in Beatmania that aren't already on DDR.
2819793	2822255	There's stuff from 8th style I'd still like to see.
2825177	2831901	I still want to be able to play... Crap, now I forgot the name of the song.
2834103	2834443	That's alright.
2834663	2835003	It was the...
2837930	2838470	D2, Spooky, R-Love
2864017	2866839	You know, I've been wondering something for a little while now.
2866859	2870942	I have been listening to you guys and Gal for about a year now as a podcast.
2871642	2876725	On a consistent basis, you guys seem to bring your classic and more often than not obscure games from the past.
2877206	2878166	Which I love, by the way.
2878646	2881748	So my question is this, when are you going to do a strictly classic gaming episode?
2882109	2886511	I believe I remember that being suggested in passing on a show right before you changed to the new format.
2887092	2892255	I kind of miss DarkSakura's tips section when I hear the music for the mailbag, but oh well.
2894099	2900444	I would speculate we'll probably do that if there's going to be a show where we can't be here again.
2900524	2903126	Like a couple months ago, Loki had to fill in a couple weeks.
2903766	2908889	If we have time to pre-tape in advance, we'll probably do a classic game show next time we're all not going to be here.
2909250	2914593	But honestly, because of E3 and everything, none of us can really afford to all of us be gone.
2915734	2917916	Are you out next week, DarkSakura, for birthday?
2918076	2919437	Yeah, I'm going to be...
2920740	2923314	And then you're out in two weeks for wedding, right?
2923495	2924560	Yes, so are you.
2926365	2927546	But is the wedding on Sunday?
2927566	2928166	Yes.
2928526	2930107	Oh, I thought it was Saturday this whole time.
2930347	2930768	Oh, crap.
2931308	2933810	Then maybe there'll be one coming up sooner than later.
2934110	2935290	We'll podcast your wedding.
2935370	2936931	Probably the day of Loki's wedding.
2936951	2939173	I joked about that, but yeah.
2939193	2941334	Yeah, we need to plan on that.
2941374	2944336	So probably the day of Loki's wedding, since we can't do a show live, maybe we'll do that.
2944796	2945316	That's a good idea.
2946057	2949379	Well, maybe we can invite some other folks to talk about it, too.
2949399	2950600	It'll be fun.
2951556	2954098	Well, there's also another bit on this.
2954918	2957060	When we mentioned Captain N, he brought up Kid Video.
2958701	2963684	I used to watch Kid Video religiously when I was, what, seven?
2965626	2966967	So yeah, I know Kid Video.
2967127	2969869	It was about a little garage band.
2969889	2971330	They get sucked into an animated world.
2971350	2974572	It had the little pixie girl who would sneeze.
2975613	2977274	And it was really crazy.
2977434	2978515	Yeah, I remember Kid Video.
2979475	2980176	Do you remember Kid Video?
2980196	2980296	Yeah.
2980649	2981130	PUNCTUATION
3006633	3010416	There's not a single punctuation point except at the very end of this email.
3010636	3012797	I just thought I'd point that out.
3013198	3013918	I'm a grammar nerd.
3014018	3014459	Yes, you are.
3015239	3019262	So let me see if I can... I'm good at interpreting that stuff.
3019282	3019762	No, no, no, no.
3019962	3020763	I'm my mailbox.
3020843	3021143	Alright.
3022524	3022925	Meow.
3024866	3025106	Okay.
3025466	3026307	Let me get right to the point.
3026347	3029369	I was listening to your podcast last week while you had the guy from Konami.
3029529	3036194	Well, my question is, I hear everybody talking about DDR Supernova, but for some reason it's like they skipped Flordia...
3036946	3037607	I guess it's Florida.
3037647	3038508	Florida.
3038928	3039269	Florida.
3039549	3040290	But it's in Florida.
3041432	3041692	Alright.
3041792	3043734	We have no release date or anything.
3043875	3053707	If you guys can give me a link or even some kind of update, I would be really grateful because I know a lot of people out there that don't know either and you guys wouldn't just be helping me but many people.
3054087	3056430	Thanks and keep up the good work on Lounge Radio for life.
3056952	3057833	You guys will get it.
3058133	3059013	Every state's going to have it.
3059053	3061135	I think it wants to know when Supernova's coming out in Florida.
3061155	3063897	Supernova's coming out in Florida when Supernova comes out for everybody.
3064297	3069200	And I guess the rumor was that they were taking orders for the first 50 machines and then it closed.
3069701	3073223	I don't really know how much to really credit all that.
3073563	3076785	But I would say it was supposed to be out this month, right?
3076865	3080588	So any day now, really, we should start seeing these machines pop up.
3081008	3084010	I don't think it'll really spread like wildfire until over the summer.
3084090	3086692	So you have to wait until summer for your local arcade to get this.
3087092	3097420	But if you live near a big city with a big arcade that has, you know, Hat Extreme and the other DDR games, this one will be coming as well.
3097500	3098121	Just give it time.
3099382	3102684	But yeah, we don't keep tabs on every arcade in the country, so we can't ask.
3102784	3104265	Don't be afraid to ask your local arcade.
3104305	3106647	It's a good way to show that you support it, too.
3106707	3107328	DDR Freak.
3107828	3109409	DDR Freak has a locations listing.
3110050	3115594	Anything that's put up there, being a moderator there, we regularly verify those to make sure...
3116174	3117415	Thanks for watching!
3136327	3146034	Just listen to Part A of the podcast, and I'd be genuinely surprised if the majority of those 50 launch titles weren't the NES Genesis TurboGrafx-16 downloadables.
3147415	3151558	Also, I think he'll find out in Part B, I kind of corrected myself there.
3151998	3154260	Yeah, I figured I'd go ahead and address this.
3154860	3163086	Hopefully we'll see as many as six full retail available titles to go with those, just out of curiosity and to compare how many Xbox Arcade launch games were there.
3164707	3166168	How many Xbox Live Arcade games were there?
3166568	3167929	I'd say 10 to 15, because I can't remember exactly.
3167949	3169791	I bought a lot of them, but not all of them.
3169931	3174494	Ask Major Nelson, he'd know.
3194431	3196211	You say that and I keep thinking of I Dream of Jeannie.
3196832	3197112	Sorry.
3199092	3202073	The last one says, Hey guys, doing a great job with the podcast.
3202413	3205734	My favorite thing to do after work is to play World of Warcraft while listening to the show.
3206334	3206714	Right on.
3206954	3208415	Alright, that's so cool.
3208455	3211075	Speaking of World of Warcraft, did you... Alright, sorry.
3211355	3211816	Okay, sorry.
3212116	3212756	Go ahead.
3213700	3218542	Look, I saw the most effed up video this week, and it was... The Lord of the Rings?
3218622	3221022	No, no, the people crashing the funeral party.
3221383	3230626	Like, somebody... Okay, somebody, like, in real life passed away, and they were holding an online, like, funeral service for this... I think it was a she that passed away.
3231186	3238628	And since it was on a PvP server, these guys had posted about it on a forum, and what happened is that... I think it was a Horde character.
3238668	3240049	Well, a bunch of... This whole big...
3240911	3243761	group on the Alliance side came to the funeral and killed them all.
3245447	3246350	That's horrible!
3248282	3275752	part of me is like that is so wrong but there's another half of me like the same half the same half that really likes South Park and that fucked up stuff that goes you know like and I know it's really wrong but that's let me put it this way it goes to show why I hate the PvP servers on World of Warcraft sorry to this guy if you're a PvP player whatever floats your boat I personally hate the PvP servers I had bad experience with PvP but anyway can I finish my email now?
3275792	3276612	yes you may sorry
3277796	3279057	Thank you, Rob!
3281598	3292224	Although this isn't exactly headline news like the red steel screenshots drool, I work for Philips and they're working on this new technology which sounds like something I've only dreamed about.
3292784	3303891	Imagine feeling the rush of wind when jumping out of your plane in Metal Gear Solid 3 or having your sofa rumble and all the lights in your room flicker red when Sephiroth appears in the flames in Final Fantasy VII.
3304932	3319180	This could be really cheesy, but if the technology is really good and becomes widespread and developers start creating games with this in mind, along with how excited I am about the innovative revolution, the next few years could be huge for gaming and where it's headed.
3319600	3321761	I gave a link to AMBX.com.
3322681	3329305	I said there's some video on the site that gives you an idea of the lighting effects we're talking about, lightning strikes and all the lights in the rooms flicker.
3330154	3332215	A Plane Flies By and Creates a Rush of Wind.
3332255	3333676	Sure, it's from dinky fans, but still.
3334176	3335356	And this isn't just for gaming.
3335376	3342139	Suppose it's for movies, music, PC versions of games are supposed to already be released this year, and console versions next.
3342339	3343280	Look for this at E3.
3343940	3344920	Think this will catch on?
3345020	3346361	If not this, then technology.
3346401	3348582	Like this, revolution seems to be a step in that direction.
3349022	3349882	Keep up the good work.
3350083	3354464	If you use this, you can refer to me as Bear Who Drive Car.
3354965	3357346	I'm sorry, I actually didn't see that until the very end.
3357366	3357926	My apologies.
3359038	3359378	P.S.
3359418	3363525	I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, but it's ridiculous how much I want a goddamn DS Lite.
3363906	3368333	I also agree with Sky, Final Fantasy XI is going to die shortly after Xbox 360 has released this expansion.
3370436	3371757	I did say... I said that.
3371797	3372498	I guess I must have.
3372518	3373959	I don't think it's gonna die.
3374019	3377481	I just think it's gonna... I actually think it's gonna... Oh, I remember what it was.
3377501	3381564	The comment was that I said the third expansion is gonna be the last one, probably, and then it will start to die off.
3382685	3385347	I don't think it'll be shortly, but I think, you know, in the next couple years.
3385947	3388509	There will always be crazies that play Final Fantasy XI.
3388549	3389470	Probably I'll be one of them.
3390351	3392232	Just like there's crazies that still play EverQuest.
3392432	3394073	And you know I use that term endearingly.
3394654	3394714	Um...
3396239	3401129	But I think the popularity... You'll see server consolidations in a good two years.
3405215	3409736	The other thing I want to comment on that, the whole room lighting thing, that technology has actually been around a while.
3410156	3421319	On the Commodore 64, I remember this, there used to be a program where you could have the Commodore 64 control the lights in your house for like when you're away on vacation or whatever, you could have the Commodore 64 regulating the lights in your house.
3421599	3424160	So it's not this huge... I think this is a little something different.
3425360	3432522	No, I know, but they're saying that you want to change the lights red for when Sephiroth comes in and all this other lighting effects you can do in your house, right?
3433150	3435511	Now it'd be more like an interactive station.
3436792	3437112	Alright.
3437232	3445095	But they actually, there were things very similar to that, the previous E3s, like the, what was it called, the ass kicker or something?
3447016	3451418	That thing that you put under your chair and it makes, and you feel the bass in your butt or something?
3452679	3459362	I thought that that thing was kind of cool, but you know, like it, especially for the music games or for some of the effects in the games...
3461685	3469249	I think, though, that having something immersive like that is going to be pricey, but I think it really would enhance the experience.
3469809	3470389	Be interesting.
3471249	3471510	All right.
3472930	3473310	Is that it?
3474051	3474691	All right.
3474711	3475031	You know what?
3475051	3478673	With all that, we're just one step closer to the holodeck from Star Trek.
3478853	3480834	That's where gaming will be in 50 years.
3480894	3481574	It'll be the holodeck.
3482611	3485713	You know, I had this conversation with somebody like a year and a half ago.
3486013	3488295	We were doing our big Trekkie nerd discussion.
3488615	3492038	And we were talking about how holodecks are like the Nintendo of the future.
3493819	3494099	Pretty.
3494139	3496261	Someday we'll do this show in a holodeck form.
3496301	3496901	It'll be amazing.
3497261	3499563	You could, you know, sit on our laps during the show.
3499623	3500163	No, please don't.
3500243	3501224	That's violating us.
3501884	3502185	Anyway.
3503546	3504166	Moving on.
3505607	3508069	I think we have a contest to settle, do we not?
3509530	3509970	Perhaps.
3510390	3510831	That's right.
3510851	3511251	We have a
3536960	3537921	You always keep them low.
3537961	3538441	Let's do this.
3538801	3538441	1, 2, 3, 4.
3540082	3540803	Here's our winner.
3540943	3545686	Our winner is... I have to verify that they got two characters right here.
3546507	3548949	Yes, they said David Palmer and Edgar Stiles.
3548969	3550950	Those are indeed two people that died this season.
3551371	3554193	So say congratulations, everybody, to MiniMe283.
3554273	3557035	He won the 24 contest.
3557175	3557855	One of our chatters.
3558276	3559136	Yes, one of our chatters.
3559456	3560637	I like it when the chatty people win.
3560657	3561418	Good job, MiniMe283.
3562318	3563858	Who's actually, I think, eating right now.
3564819	3566779	So he's away and didn't even hear that.
3567379	3567679	Yeah.
3568079	3568639	All right, well.
3569040	3570140	That would be mini food.
3572200	3574701	All right, so DarkSakura, remember what they're going to win in that prize pack?
3574721	3575921	Will I forward this to myself here?
3576201	3577401	Oh, I'm sorry.
3577841	3580042	It was the game and the shirt, right?
3580222	3581042	Yeah, a bunch of stuff.
3581822	3582623	That'll be good times.
3583143	3587244	So big thanks to our buddies over at 2K Games that are hooking us up with these prize packs.
3588584	3589144	Appreciate it.
3591126	3593308	People like to win free stuff.
3593328	3597291	They like to win free stuff so much that we're going to give away something else right now.
3598031	3602074	We're going to give away also a copy of Amped 3.
3602674	3603455	For the 360.
3603515	3605056	That's right, for the Xbox 360.
3606257	3607938	And you've played this game a lot, Loki, right?
3608479	3609219	What do you do in this game?
3609900	3612141	Well, it's a basic snowboarding game.
3612221	3616184	It's really, what kind of sets it apart is the way they kind of do the storyline.
3616484	3619166	It's done with sock puppets and just weird
3619858	3624341	Loki, give me a number between 1 and that many times 10.
3649033	3651215	Okay, let's go with 14.
3653937	3654917	Alright, let's see.
3654937	3654917	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
3665745	3666946	Is that the same person that won last?
3667006	3667646	No, I don't think that is.
3667686	3668687	I think this is a different person.
3669287	3670568	So I think this one wins.
3671989	3675432	This goes to MikeG1Amp3.
3675992	3676433	Good job.
3676693	3677013	Excellent.
3677790	3679252	Congratulations to you, my friend.
3680374	3680855	You're a winner.
3681496	3685323	Thank you to everybody that participated, and we'll be doing more giveaways in the future.
3685884	3686164	Of course.
3687026	3687286	All right.
3687747	3691694	Let's move on to our next story, and that comes courtesy of me.
3692776	3693437	Final Fantasy XI
3714298	3716339	Yes, April 20th, we're the secret secret character junkie.
3739417	3740237	will be available.
3740257	3740677	That's right.
3740738	3743779	Junkie Horror will be an unlockable job class in the new Final Fantasy.
3743819	3744279	It'll be great.
3745899	3747240	And they'll all be Mithras.
3747440	3747940	Imagine that.
3747980	3748841	They'll all be Mithras.
3749141	3750021	I thought they'd be Taro.
3752182	3753542	I would play a Taro Junkie Horror.
3753562	3754863	I think that would be fun, actually.
3755043	3755583	It'd be a good time.
3756483	3756824	All right.
3757224	3758344	Loki, what do you got?
3759364	3764186	I've got some info about the IEMA and VSDA merging.
3764847	3768828	And, of course, I always hear about the VSDA, just job-related stuff.
3769469	3784277	The Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association, basically the VSTA of video games, and the VSTA, the Video Software Dealers Association, who basically represent all the mass merchants, video specialty stores, etc.
3784998	3787199	Well, now they're combined, so it's going to be one agency.
3788658	3792641	One place for all the interactive software sales and stuff.
3793022	3806132	And basically, they have to say, by coming together in one organization, the retailers, distributors of DVDs and video games will increase their collective power and the benefit from business acumen and product knowledge of one another.
3806773	3812517	And that's basically quoted from the chairman, VSTA chairman, Bob Geisman.
3813878	3815440	So I think that's pretty cool.
3815960	3817902	That means I might have to go to VSTA this year.
3817922	3818382	All right.
3819326	3825528	I don't know, they always throw a really cool show down in Vegas, so... Right about the same time as the porno convention.
3826788	3827388	Right next door.
3828148	3830449	What do you think long-term effects of this will be on the game industry?
3830689	3830909	Anything?
3831129	3831489	That's good.
3832250	3848194	You're gonna see, definitely, you know, the IEMA and VSDA are gonna be, you know, ones saying, you know, hell no, we don't want these stupid video game laws, you know, ones that they're trying to pass limiting the sales of this stuff.
3848969	3849269	DarkSakura
3867543	3868083	Guitar Hero Peripheral
3890189	3895454	Um, they've mapped different WAV files into the controller's buttons so that you press the button and it will start playing the loop.
3896054	3899117	And so you, because you've mapped the different sounds, you can sort of play different stuff on it.
3899157	3902660	It's more like, well, I don't know, like... It's a MIDI sequencer.
3902680	3905342	Yeah, that's what I was about to say.
3906563	3907064	But, um...
3908211	3912453	But I mean, even RedOctane kind of, you know, thinks it's pretty cool.
3912773	3919336	There's a quote here that says, we in Harmonix both are very much, I'm sorry, are both very much encouraged by this type of fandom.
3919796	3925879	Having a game that a community like this thrives around is a great achievement, but it's the community that keeps it going.
3925919	3926479	They're awesome.
3929321	3931842	So I thought that was actually a quote from John Tam.
3932262	3934263	I like that they endorsed the hacking.
3934303	3935724	That's pretty cool of them, you know.
3936304	3936444	Well,
3937325	3945108	I honestly think that we're going to see more new innovation based on the fan community.
3945948	3960974	I really see that a lot of game companies are not going to be as willing to experiment in depth, but when it comes from the fans and they see that there's a type of interest in this type of thing, it might turn on a few light bulbs and have the hamster wheels moving.
3963955	3964916	Moving on to another story.
3965974	3968716	Spike Lee, Inside Man, Inside the Inside Man
3996735	4000358	But it's in the movie because they're trying to depict video games as violent.
4001139	4005943	And Spike Lee is hoping that this scene doesn't actually get done in a future game.
4006343	4013790	He explains, I just hope people understand that that is an absolute statement about my horror at how violent these games that young kids play are.
4014250	4017853	And also the infatuation with violence and gangster rap among the black community.
4018234	4021657	It's not a real game, but not that far-fetched from the games that are being sold.
4022884	4026507	It's my thought that Spike Lee has decided to believe everything he sees on TV.
4028269	4028729	You know what?
4029069	4030330	That's not violent enough.
4031792	4032853	I'm not satisfied.
4033213	4033934	You want to see more?
4033954	4036316	You want to see more violent stuff?
4036616	4036896	Hell yeah.
4036916	4037477	All right.
4037837	4042621	Might I also point out Spike Lee has brought to you many different films out there.
4043262	4046965	Trying to think of some of these that are R-rated movies that he's done.
4048066	4049667	What is Do the Right Thing R-rated?
4050187	4050648	I think so.
4052455	4052875	Let's see.
4055457	4057198	Yeah, USA, that was an R-rated movie.
4057478	4059579	And let's see, how about Malcolm X?
4059619	4060760	Was that rated R as well?
4061981	4062821	I wouldn't doubt it.
4064222	4066083	Actually, it was PG-13.
4066143	4068044	Still not appropriate for children under 13, though.
4068685	4069846	You get the idea here.
4069886	4072007	I'm just kind of trying to be a smartass on this one.
4072947	4077710	You know, Hollywood puts out the violent stuff, too, so I don't really get it.
4078231	4080432	It seems like it's the pot calling the kettle black.
4081735	4082235	Jack Thompson's Claim
4111587	4112488	Wait a second.
4112608	4112828	What?
4113108	4115569	I do remember a game where you shoved grenades in people's mouths.
4115630	4115850	What?
4116610	4117711	Blaster Master.
4118051	4121333	That fucking frog had it coming to him and he tossed grenades in his mouth.
4122314	4122974	Fuck that.
4123374	4125716	Spike Lee, you were beat by it quite a long time.
4125796	4131079	But that's when you hit pause while it's exploding and then you wait like six seconds and unpause and it'll kill him.
4132080	4134181	Exactly, but still, it's been done.
4135787	4136668	Blaster Master did it.
4137128	4143292	You know, I think somebody should make a game that's like Kaboom, but instead it's just a giant mouth that's catching all these grenades falling from the sky.
4143312	4144113	That'd be great.
4144793	4146514	What a perfect response to this article.
4147015	4151257	Send a nice little care package over to Spike Lee and say, with love, the gaming community.
4153259	4153639	Loki.
4154299	4155820	Speaking of movies soon to be made.
4156441	4159062	Yes, they're making a movie for Cold Fear.
4160943	4163125	Basically a press release put out by
4164331	4182961	Dark Works SA the leading French video game developer although I thought Ubisoft was the leading French video game developer but I could be wrong that they are I don't know they're putting out another movie that's going to probably be crap are they making it in French?
4183501	4183941	or what?
4186302	4192946	I don't know to be honest I see video game movie for a game that I haven't played you know
4195256	4196797	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4222442	4230830	actually Kingdom Hearts 2 hit 2.5 million it's actually approaching 10 million in the world it's pretty cool huh
4231109	4233210	Wow, that's a lot of sales.
4233450	4236471	Yeah, but for Japan and North America, it topped 2.5 million.
4236611	4244414	That's 1.2 million for Japan since December 22nd and 1.3 million in North America since the 28th of last month.
4246555	4248976	This series worldwide has hit 8.5 million.
4249796	4254498	With the European release, they're expecting it to top 10 million.
4255878	4258459	And actually, the numbers are well-deserved.
4258699	4260440	It really is a very well-done game.
4261069	4261450	Very cool.
4262371	4264115	This game might sell that many copies.
4264535	4265177	Probably not.
4265237	4270847	But Metroid Prime 3 is going to be the flagship title for Nintendo Revolution.
4271348	4271568	What?
4272438	4273458	Well, that's what they're saying.
4273878	4278959	Nintendo is going to be showing this fully playable at the E3 Expo.
4279379	4288581	Now, I'm wondering if it's not Metroid Prime 3 on GameCube, but with revolution enhancements, sort of like they're saying is going to happen with, or would be happening with Zelda.
4288841	4296902	I think that's a little more along the lines of what's really going on, is that Metroid Prime 3 is probably a GameCube game, but with revolution aspect to it.
4296942	4299423	So that should be very interesting, because this game kind of...
4300223	4301224	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4324656	4325436	So we'll see what happens.
4325597	4326597	That should be an exciting title.
4326917	4332341	I really liked Metroid Prime 2 at last year's E3, but I never really... I mean, it's just my GameCube.
4332401	4333121	I have to be honest.
4333201	4337404	I don't play it so much because there's not a lot of new titles I get really excited about on GameCube anymore.
4337904	4338684	Maybe with the Zelda.
4338704	4339005	We'll see.
4339825	4341286	One more story for this segment, Loki.
4342166	4342507	Yes.
4343227	4351332	You know, when you thought that you couldn't whore Burger King enough in 360 games, well, you're wrong.
4352092	4353273	They're going to actually make their own
4353869	4355050	Xbox 360 games.
4356351	4356811	That's right.
4357011	4362814	Burger King is going to be making games for the 360 and Xbox.
4362894	4368178	I guess they will be Xbox games that will be fully compatible with the 360 that we're going to be selling for $3.69.
4368478	4375362	Oh, I'm sure these will be top shelf games, too.
4375422	4382306	You'll be buying them with your Angus Cheesy Bacon Steakburger, which I might add, by the way, isn't very good.
4383049	4383669	Not a very good game.
4384129	4388010	They do have three games that are going to be coming out, very appropriately deemed.
4388230	4390510	Action, Fighting, and Racing.
4391471	4401613	The action game, they're comparing it to Halo or Destroy All Humans, which will probably turn out more like Wolfenstein 3D.
4401633	4408154	The fighting game is supposed to be combining elements of Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat.
4411277	4411817	That's excellent.
4412418	4413639	Who's the king gonna fight?
4413699	4414799	We all know the king would be in it.
4414819	4415440	Who's he gonna fight?
4415460	4416020	I don't know.
4416080	4416741	Who cares?
4417541	4422685	The evil... He could fight... He could beat the shit out of Hamburglar and Ronald McDonald and I think they might have problems with that.
4423105	4440077	And racing is basically gonna be combining... Or they said it's very comparable to Need for Speed or Forza, which I'd laugh... They do have some... Or I should say Kotaku posted some screenshots or I guess...
4441806	4442166	I don't know.
4442386	4443486	Internal documents or something?
4443546	4446967	Something like that of concept art, I guess.
4447027	4448908	I heard they got in a little bit of hot water.
4449228	4450108	Yeah, yeah.
4450408	4452369	But the screenshots are hilarious.
4452509	4457430	There's like one that's looking like the king's trying to give a hamburger to some prostitute.
4458010	4460211	There's another one where the king... Is that for real?
4460251	4460711	Come on.
4460731	4462511	This shit has joke written all over it.
4462551	4464052	Like a commercial or something.
4464412	4465332	Marketing campaign.
4465852	4468173	Well, I don't know, but... You know...
4470165	4471285	Sikoon suggests World of BurgerCraft
4486886	4487486	That might be fun.
4487886	4488246	You never know.
4488587	4490807	Ota G says, Burger Combat!
4491388	4492868	Plays a little music behind that, I'm sure.
4493688	4495709	DJ Poo Eater says, Clerk Killer.
4495889	4500551	So the king could be fighting all the Burger King employees.
4500631	4501431	That might be exciting.
4502471	4502811	Who knows?
4504732	4505192	Oh, you know what?
4505432	4507073	How about the BK Kids Club?
4507133	4508573	Remember the BK Kids Club?
4508933	4510734	That's who the king needs to regulate on.
4510954	4511594	That would be fun.
4511754	4513355	That would be kick-ass.
4515686	4517408	Alright, we're gonna go to a break here.
