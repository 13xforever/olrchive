487	19090	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19901	26186	And we're back here live on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 180 for this April the 9th of 2006.
27167	31330	Loki would like to begin this segment with a small correction, wouldn't you, Loki?
31390	32150	Yes, I would.
32651	36213	Yes, about those numbers about the Revolution launch titles, I was a little off.
36634	36994	A little?
37735	38595	Yeah, I was a bit off.
38855	39816	Okay.
39976	47482	Actually, coming from Game Front, the true number is 20 titles, one-third of which are said to be developed by Nintendo themselves.
48002	48303	So...
49022	49562	I was close.
49602	52223	I had the number 20 in there and there's a percentage.
53563	58205	Which means Orange Lounge Radio will be pudding free for those of you that listen to Part A. Thankfully.
59405	60125	Hooray!
60285	61826	My dignity is spared another day.
62066	63766	Still better coverage than IGN.
65927	66667	Can I say that?
66867	67227	I don't know.
68147	68707	Moving on.
69408	70768	You can address those cards and letters too.
70808	71348	What is your email?
71368	72789	You don't have an Orange Lounge Radio account, do you?
72829	73469	We'll get you one.
73789	74269	We'll get you one.
74309	75649	Remind me to hook you up with one after the show.
75669	77770	We'll hook you up with a Spike at Orange Lounge Radio email.
78564	79404	I'll take you up on that.
79444	80064	Alright, sounds good.
80405	84786	Now, did anybody notice in the first segment of tonight's show, not a single story on Sony PlayStation?
85046	88427	Because everything's been quiet on the PS3 front this week, pretty much, hasn't it?
89787	90207	Yeah.
90267	91888	Well, there was one little thing, right, Loki?
92748	93708	Yeah.
94689	95289	Let's see here.
96990	109655	Basically, according to some French radio show, there was an interview done where it was leaked out, I guess, that the PlayStation 3 would be somewhere between the price point of 499, 599 euros in the UK.
109675	111676	So everyone's speculating, oh my god, it's going to be $650, $700 some dollars here.
112617	114117	Not the case.
121567	131653	Actually, a lot of times the price point over there, they will get screwed over because their price point will be... For example, for the Xbox 360, I believe their price point is €399 for the premium system, whereas we were $399.
131693	132454	So maybe €499 to €599.
132494	133154	I'm thinking more about €499.
133194	134735	That's probably going to be the price point in the U.S.
144781	147282	I think $4.99 is a reasonable price point for the US too.
147902	158426	I thought it was very interesting though because this news kind of came out early in the week and A, people ran with this saying that PS3 price announced and first off I was thinking, okay, no, price was not announced.
158846	163607	Some guy made an inadvertent comment that may or may not even be the truth.
163687	168529	I mean, I know that this guy was a Sony exec or whatever but, you know, I just, still, it's not,
169649	175392	With all due respect to Europe, Europe is not where the magic is happening right now in regards to PlayStation 3.
175472	178774	The magic will happen there soon enough, but that's not where the systems are being made.
179094	184437	Had this slip come from Sony in Japan, maybe I would have been a little more, you know, apt to believe it.
184697	188559	But then how people suddenly made this direct conversion of euros to dollars.
188579	193501	You're right, and completely disregarded the fact that usually the UK folks get screwed when it comes to price.
193541	194522	I'm very sorry, you guys.
194582	195222	It's just the fact.
195242	196783	You guys kind of get screwed, so sorry.
198243	198904	Not always, though.
198964	200484	Sometimes they get games around the same price.
200784	201945	But a lot of times they do get screwed.
202585	207846	And that means that usually the amount that we pay in dollars, they pay in euros.
207866	209427	It's usually about the conversion.
209707	210667	So I think you're right.
210687	213388	$4.99 to $5.99 is more of a realistic point.
213748	218010	But again, we've got the Revolution and the 360 to compete with.
218410	222251	And unless you can sell me that I cannot live without Blu-ray...
223465	223966	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
238988	241149	Gameplay, eh, it's not the same.
241189	241869	We don't know.
242349	243009	We don't know.
243129	244350	We don't really know anything yet.
244510	247050	We're just talking about the titles that they've announced so far.
247130	250772	They don't seem, it's the same game Microsoft's playing.
251212	255853	Let's make the games prettier and not change anything because, hey, it worked before, so.
257053	259474	Yeah, but take a game like Oblivion.
259734	262055	Oblivion could not have been done on the regular Xbox.
262475	265636	I mean, it's so vast and it's so pretty.
266519	269281	I mean, that's really a next-gen game right there.
269722	271603	Did you spend much time with Morrowind?
273345	275847	Not a lot, but I'd seen it.
275947	278929	It felt the same game, just not as pretty.
280168	284030	But if we're talking about gameplay, I wouldn't argue that there's a big difference there.
285110	285570	Alright.
286050	288371	Oblivion feels really big.
288711	292033	And with everything that they're saying you can do with it and just all the vastness.
292053	295614	Now, one part I didn't see in the other game was I didn't see character creation.
295674	297355	Was it as thorough in that game?
297635	297975	I don't know.
298335	298795	Maybe it was.
300136	301276	I seem to recall that it was.
301596	302857	It's been, you know...
303880	305422	A good minute, but I do think so.
305862	308284	I'm sure people in our chat room will be able to help out there.
308364	310787	OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat if you want.
312128	314030	Okay, so, whatever.
316452	316893	Moving on.
318380	318620	and so on.
348002	350224	But who knows what that could mean for Xbox's future.
351005	352146	Loki, what do you think about that news?
352586	354528	Eh, whatever.
354648	358811	Microsoft's just absorbing companies now, so... Spike?
359692	363495	I feel similarly about this, about how I feel about their acquisition of Rare.
364075	367078	They make one pretty trophy title a game every year or two.
367748	374834	But overall, I don't see Anti-Lionhead as a big industry-changing, challenging force.
374914	378978	But it only takes a handful of those trophy games to sell your system, asks Nintendo.
380960	382301	That's a very valid point.
382601	387205	Although, I don't really count Fable as a very great game.
387225	388006	Fable...
388507	394772	The only reason Fable was so freaking great was because there wasn't anything else like it on the Xbox.
395353	399616	Go over to PlayStation 2, GameCube, you got plenty of games like Fable.
399657	405902	Although, to Fable's credit, it was a little more expansive than most games in the way that you could control your character's fate.
405942	407143	Not that we hadn't seen it before.
407443	412646	but it was so fluid and it was such a turning point of the game, I don't think you really saw that in the other systems.
413087	423373	But you're right, the gameplay itself was not, I mean it was kind of button mashing was the fighting, it wasn't anything that revolutionary, but it still was really the only game like it on the Xbox.
424614	425494	for that reason.
425934	428295	And I would argue the same thing is happening with Oblivion.
428595	434017	I think the only reason Oblivion is doing so phenomenally is it's got no competition on the 360 right now.
434277	434617	Nothing.
434897	437918	There is no game even remotely close to what Oblivion is like.
438218	450321	Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it's a great game that would be good even if there was competition, but still, I think the only reason why I see half my friends less playing this game is because I know my friends.
450361	451481	A lot of them are into role-playing games.
451501	452802	There's nothing else for them to play on 360 right now.
455049	455229	Yep.
457310	457951	Just my thought.
459492	462134	Alright, let's go on to another story.
462314	464755	Loki, what's this about the Xbox Live Arcade?
465416	467217	It's getting some new games, that's for sure.
467817	483447	Starting off here with Cloning Clyde, which sounds pretty weird, but basically they're keying this as it's going to be a completely unique 3D adventure and puzzle game that may bring a new meaning to the word schizophrenic.
484268	484428	So,
485132	489633	Basically, Clyde was an ordinary but slightly dim guy before Dupliclone Inc.
489713	492294	paid him $20 to take part in a cloning experiment.
493174	496495	And I guess, you know, things go crazy from there.
496795	500296	And so, yeah, it's going to be coming to the live arcade.
500576	511359	It is made by a company called Ninja Bee, who you might remember did Outpost Cloaky X, which is a pretty big hit on Xbox Live.
511439	513700	So, you know, check it out when it comes out.
514947	515608	Geometry Wars Crystal Quest
535017	536498	Not totally, but very similar.
537118	538078	And same with Feeding Friends.
538198	543880	Well, no, because you don't have a gun in Feeding Friends, but just, I don't know, that whole dodging thing feels... It feels a little similar.
544200	546601	Was it Mutant Storm?
547041	548362	I haven't even played that one.
548562	549962	There's also Robotron.
550782	551463	Now, wait a minute.
551523	552743	Robotron's a classic.
552783	553943	I mean, a classic classic.
553983	557064	You can't... Yeah, but I'm saying that they're all similar.
557084	564547	I'm not saying that... Robotron's more like Smash TV, if anything else, but both were made by the same company, so you could almost say that Smash TV in a effed up way is like
565031	565592	Robotron.
567634	568435	Maybe I'm just crazy.
570477	574061	We mentioned in Part A that you can get brand new outfits for Cameo.
574181	574942	Woohoo!
575578	581100	You can dress them up as Orchid and Killer Instinct characters and all those other things.
581440	589343	But also one thing that should be noted about Cameo, they just patched their co-op mode, and now you can do the online co-op play with Cameo.
589383	593325	And I believe new achievements come with this as well, but here's the thing.
593645	602028	Because Cameo has already hit their limit of 1,000 achievement points, now there are zero-point achievements that you can get in Cameo with this new patch, is what I'm hearing.
602068	603569	You get achievements, but they're not worth anything.
603729	604089	Who cares?
606356	607116	That's dead to me.
607297	612479	Well, some people really wanted to do co-op and cameo.
613199	615820	What they should do then is still give you the co-op achievements.
616640	617941	Who cares if you play over live?
618321	620682	Just do the same co-op achievements that they have in the game.
621345	623566	Just, you know, now you can play live or local.
624127	627309	And HitStun says the online co-op patch is free, right?
627509	628129	Yes, that is true.
628169	628609	It is free.
628909	629090	Yes.
629210	630991	So enjoy the free things while you can.
631031	637675	I'm sure as soon as you put in Cameo, I haven't patched mine yet, but I'm sure as soon as you put in Cameo, it'll say, an upgrade for this game is now available.
637755	638175	Yay!
638715	640896	And then it'll just patch its way onto your hard drive.
641277	642517	That is assuming you have a hard drive.
643098	646480	Then we can be underwhelmed with people on the internet at the same time.
648994	650555	You know what just made that made me think of though?
650795	651896	What happens if you don't have a hard drive?
652556	653256	Are you just screwed?
653277	655218	Are you gonna have to patch this game every time?
657299	659420	Well, you can maybe download the patch to your memory card.
660444	661345	Oh, I guess that's a good point.
661565	662706	I guess you could save it to your memory card.
662726	664928	Of course, how are you going to play anything with a memory card?
664968	665208	I know.
665688	667069	Memory card was just useless.
667149	669872	It's just something that they put out there and say, you know what?
669912	676497	Hey, there's an option to buying the... No, you can take your memory card to an Xbox 360 kiosk and get Uber special downloads.
677157	678178	That don't work!
678739	686965	By the way, where the fuck is my goddamn burnout card that they promised me months ago that I downloaded from the kiosk and then we go to play Burnout?
687326	688607	Oh, by the way, it doesn't work!
690007	691567	Oh, did we say working car?
691587	692508	I don't believe we did.
692888	694328	So, you know what?
695328	696028	You're fucked.
697109	697969	I love setting him off.
700309	701950	Stupid kiosk thing.
702670	704830	Why'd I spend the money on that stupid card?
705250	705870	I don't know.
706491	707991	Loki, what's next on the news?
709451	710031	Seriously?
711032	714892	Well, the Michigan game law was ruled unconstitutional.
715473	716693	Like, we didn't see that coming.
717533	717653	Um,
718311	722494	So yeah, basically thrown out because, yeah, it's unconstitutional, blah, blah, blah.
722514	725076	Was the Michigan law like the California law, or what was the deal there?
726457	728479	To be honest, I don't know if it was very similar or not.
728619	730701	I imagine they're probably pretty close.
733042	733323	I don't know.
734884	738145	They really shouldn't try to regulate the game sales and stuff.
738205	742966	Yeah, it was, as it summed up, intended to restrict the sale of certain games to minors.
743046	745527	And they say that was unconstitutional and can't be implemented.
745547	747708	So it sounds pretty similar to what we had going on in California here.
747748	748348	Exactly.
748448	753849	In fact, I think that they should be able to sell porn to minors too now because it's unconstitutional.
755610	756970	Children have the right to porn.
760151	760871	Have you no dignity?
761051	761972	Have you no dignity?
764551	766912	Xbox Live Friendless Notifier
790106	794429	and you can even have it in a little task bar and it'll actually alert you when people sign on and offline.
795310	804276	I guess what it's doing is it's kind of borrowing from exactly what Xbox Live, or I'm sorry, Xbox.com does, but it sort of delivers that news to your desktop.
804696	808338	So you can see when, you know, if you're stalking someone, you can see right when they come online.
808819	809439	So it's pretty cool.
810019	812241	So like I'd be able to see if Loki's online from my computer.
813263	813663	Excellent.
813764	816166	If I'm too lazy to access Xbox.com.
816466	816687	Yes.
817007	821431	I'm surprised Microsoft didn't... I think the most surprising thing about this story is that someone beat Microsoft to it.
822192	828038	I think if I were Microsoft right now, I'd be wanting to buy this software from this guy or acquire this guy.
828419	829840	No, they would just want to sue him.
830301	830661	Why?
831041	833484	Because they're Microsoft and they can't... Why would you sue this guy?
833784	835986	He wrote a practical, useful application that...
836980	839622	GK128 in the chatroom says, I have 360 friends, the program.
839662	841244	It's cool, but it hogs RAM.
860854	862475	So it might be a little bit of a memory hog.
862815	864935	So have a lot of RAM if you're going to be using this program.
865436	873698	But you know, also, it's a program that has, you know, it's written by, you know, a fan, essentially.
873778	875639	So it's probably not optimized yet.
875719	877180	I mean, it's a first release, it sounds like.
877220	881521	So if this guy decides to continue to upgrade this, it might get a little better in that regard.
882281	883462	Yeah.
883522	886603	GK128 would like to point out it uses 63 megabytes of RAM currently.
888544	888744	Hmm.
889564	889704	Hmm.
890490	891110	Very interesting.
891351	891771	Interesting.
892251	894012	Alright, moving on.
894893	897034	Loki, you have some music game news.
897674	897954	Yes.
898955	900316	In the groove, PlayStation 2.
901656	905338	As I've been stating before, this game is merely Stepmania.
906179	912102	And now, like Stepmania, you can put your own songs in it for the PlayStation 2.
912582	919006	However, of course, the tools have been out there already to unpack everything that's in the groove for the PlayStation 2.
919670	924293	and actually dump that stuff to your hard drive so you can play the official songs because they're just Step Mania files.
924633	938403	Well, now they have the tools to repack it so you can actually put whatever songs you want in there and be able to burn it to a disc and either play it with any sort of tools that you use to play backup discs on a PlayStation 2 or hacks or work around or whatever.
939263	941765	So, you know, I guess that's pretty cool.
942345	947549	You know, one of the reasons why, you know, I don't understand why people pay for Step Mania, but...
948820	953223	Now you can and I'm just not surprised.
953463	956245	I knew this was going to come one of these days and
957316	958657	Now that's available, that's kind of neat.
958798	959859	You get to play all your songs.
960159	962481	If you like the In The Groove songs, go ahead and play the In The Groove songs.
962501	965183	If you like DDR... Because you put DDR songs in In The Groove?
965284	965864	They had it.
965944	970548	DDR, all the DDR songs, In The Groove 2, and In The Groove songs, all in one disc.
970969	971569	Wow.
971750	972770	They had all this stuff in there.
972791	975073	Can you just download this from the website, burn it, and ready to go?
975453	976714	Oh, no, it's not available on the website.
977275	978416	You've got to dig for it.
978656	982199	Unfortunately, I cannot give out where it is, but...
983427	987889	Your local Bomani downloading ISO place will probably have it.
988249	989130	BitTorrent, that type of thing.
989650	994212	So look for it and have fun, I guess.
996933	997673	Very interesting.
998594	999174	Moving on.
1001099	1003220	Follow-up to a story we were talking about a few weeks ago.
1003340	1009224	Remember the town in Ohio that got slammed on April Fool's?
1009484	1011225	Actually, we may not have done this on the last podcast.
1011245	1014506	This may have been my spinoff show I did on Wednesday.
1015227	1019009	I talked about this story about the girls who played the prank in the town and had little question mark blocks.
1019394	1019954	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1047646	1051430	We're not thinking about the consequences of their actions in this day and age.
1068104	1071106	Most people don't know what a question mark block reference is.
1071526	1074768	And you're right, they probably think about Batman or something, you know?
1075108	1077369	Yeah, I'm going to blow up this streetlight.
1078430	1080951	Al-Qaeda will strike us in our streetlights.
1080991	1083032	Oh my, now the FBI is going to monitor this program.
1083052	1083553	Thank you very much.
1084853	1085394	You jerk.
1085414	1087975	I kind of agree, though.
1088996	1090236	It's an iconic symbol.
1090276	1091017	I can't help but think...
1092254	1096057	3 out of 3 people in this room are going to know what that question mark is.
1096077	1098398	Back to the OLR statistics magic, right?
1098738	1103021	So 100% of Americans know what a question mark block is and shouldn't have been alarmed, right?
1103822	1104702	This is what I'm saying.
1105743	1107484	But really, the percentage must be over 50%.
1108425	1111967	I can't help but believe that this... Not if you're an old person.
1114474	1117075	So your grandmother wouldn't know what a question mark block is?
1117215	1119976	Unless my grandma happened to be old granny hardcore, probably not.
1121157	1123678	No, my grandma would have no idea what a question mark block is.
1125138	1125818	She would have no idea.
1125878	1129680	She would probably think about Frank Gorshin from Batman.
1130280	1130720	The Riddler.
1134842	1135902	That was my Riddler impersonation.
1135942	1136502	That was great, huh?
1137303	1138003	I worked on that all day.
1138423	1139203	I stand corrected.
1139804	1143165	Maybe we won't be in so much trouble if we find a cure for cancer, right Loki?
1144008	1149172	Yes, in the meantime, though, you can play a game called Remission, where you can blow away cancer.
1150393	1158659	Yes, in this game, basically, you play a micro-robot by the name of, I believe, Roxy.
1159580	1167285	And you are basically in the body and destroying these rapidly multiplying rogue cells.
1168907	1170768	And basically, it's something that they've
1171271	1181219	It's kind of done to help cancer patients cope with their illness while educating them and increasing players' sense of control over their circumstances.
1184041	1184581	That's great.
1184761	1188364	Unfortunately, though, it should be mentioned that this game does not cure cancer.
1188824	1191787	Just to clear up anything, because there's a lot of stupid people out there.
1193848	1195850	You know what it kind of sounds like to me?
1196050	1196810	It's kind of like...
1199238	1204321	It's like that old game that would be like the tooth fighter, the cavity fighting game.
1204541	1211926	I remember I had this on Commodore 64, and you were like, you carried around the giant toothbrush, and you had to wipe the plaque, or you'd get attacked by the little cavity monsters.
1212366	1215208	That's what this sounds like to me, except instead of teeth, it's cancer.
1215748	1224854	Yes, and so cancer patients will get to play crappy games now, as if they weren't tortured enough about the fact that their cancer might not be operable.
1227036	1227496	Great.
1232766	1246652	DarkSakura is not here tonight as we mentioned earlier in the program.
1246692	1247872	She's feeling sick.
1247952	1249212	She has Asian Bird Flu.
1249553	1249933	No, I'm teasing.
1249953	1253194	She doesn't have Asian Bird Flu, but she's sick and we hope she feels better soon.
1253534	1258116	She's usually in charge of the mailbox and this would be the part where we would go to the mailbag
1259082	1266726	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com However, I haven't dug through the mailbag this week, so I have no idea what's in there.
1266786	1270827	However, I have looked at the MySpace, and we got some questions on MySpace.
1270908	1277290	People who didn't realize they can send it over to Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com So I'm going to go ahead and read a question that we got on MySpace.
1278231	1279532	And this question comes to us from Joey.
1279972	1280332	Hi, Joey!
1281392	1285094	Joey says, Hey, I just got through part B of this week's podcast, meaning last week, 179.
1286054	1292657	The part where you guys talked about the Genesis got me to my closet and I pulled out my Genesis 3, the slim line of the Genesis, if you will.
1293237	1298880	Then I realized the only game I could find was my Street Fighter 2 Special Champions Edition and Mortal Kombat.
1299580	1304781	I was hoping to restart my collection and hoping you could help me out by giving me a short list of good games to look for.
1305381	1311882	Now I know all about the Sonics and ToeJam and Earls, so maybe if you guys knew some non-mainstream games, that would be awesome.
1312402	1315483	Also, do you remember the name of that new Genesis game being released?
1315823	1321124	I'm not sure if I heard about it from you guys, but this is the only show I can think of that would have cool news like that.
1321524	1323004	Sorry about the length of this, by the way.
1323144	1324224	Not a problem, Joey.
1324264	1326125	Appreciate the Myspace message.
1326705	1326785	Uh...
1327345	1330647	Joey, the name of the game you're trying to think about on the Genesis is called Beggar Prince.
1330727	1332429	That was the new game that's being released.
1332449	1336291	And we did bring that up a few weeks ago on this show.
1336671	1345317	And actually, if you want to visit one of our buddies over on allgames.com, Bobby Blackwolf, visit his site at allgames.com slash podcast.
1346118	1349200	And actually, I think he's also at bobbyblackwolfshow.com now.
1351061	1353362	He had an interview with the people that made Beggar Prince.
1353403	1354623	It was a really long interview.
1354643	1357105	So if you want to hear all about Genesis development in this day and age,
1357618	1362220	Look back in his archives about six weeks or so, and he had an interview a while back, so check that out.
1363261	1370664	As far as non-standard Genesis games, well, you didn't mention Phantasy Star, my friend, so if you're into RPGs, you don't want to miss the Phantasy Star series.
1372245	1374906	It's a shame Jamie's not here, because she loves the obscure Genesis titles.
1374926	1375887	Can you think of anything, Spike?
1376736	1379199	Um, could we start with Obscura and work our way down?
1379219	1380860	Because we could go for a good hour here.
1381040	1381821	Okay, try me.
1382281	1384203	Name some titles that this kid needs on his Genesis.
1384503	1388127	Um, I would strongly recommend, let's see, Decap Attack.
1390092	1390492	Wow.
1390992	1394854	And the funny thing is, if you've never played it, I mean, it's a fairly cartoony game.
1394914	1403156	I mean, yeah, you're a mummy zombie guy throwing your head at people, but it's done in a comical style of, like, Rise Star, which I would also recommend.
1403697	1405877	Rise Star, Gunstar Heroes.
1406097	1409939	What was that one that was, uh... It was, like, in a comic book.
1410739	1411439	Comics Zone?
1411619	1412199	Comics Zone, yeah.
1412219	1415660	Gunstar Heroes, by the way, was an excellent addition to that list, by the way.
1415941	1416321	Oh, yeah.
1416641	1416961	You know, I...
1418109	1419029	I highly recommend it.
1419050	1424192	I mean, if we're going even with, you know, kind of the standard games, don't let yourself forget the Echo games.
1425413	1427714	Don't let yourself forget Eternal Champions.
1427754	1433217	If you like substandard 2D graphics in a kind of subpar fighting game that's so cheesy you can't help but laugh.
1435498	1436958	Comments from our chatroom here.
1437118	1438619	Some suggestions from the chatroom.
1439280	1441201	Legend of Zaku suggests After Burner 2.
1441481	1442961	Ranma suggests Kid Chameleon.
1443402	1445503	DJ Pooeater suggests Alex Kidd.
1446451	1447432	Wonder Boy and Monster World.
1468587	1469688	Wonderboy and Monster World.
1469988	1470808	My best Genesis.
1471008	1473149	Jamie would say Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.
1473209	1475170	Can you even get that in this country?
1475210	1476971	I don't even know.
1476991	1478092	There are some suggestions for you.
1478172	1479813	Also, a couple quick, quick emails.
1480513	1489998	My sister sent me an email because I think she's listening to the program or something, but my sister sent me an email, Dana, and she says, Can you tell me what's wrong when I try to DDR and my foot won't work?
1490378	1493299	I try to dance, but when I go fast, my foot quits working.
1494360	1496501	But I really like your Japanese pop.
1496909	1498610	My sister writes her emails like a seven-year-old.
1498630	1500992	Might I share?
1501753	1507517	If you're playing too much DDR and your foot stops working, stop playing DDR for a couple days and then go back.
1507697	1509739	You should never push yourself too much on DDR.
1509759	1514002	If you're feeling stamina, soreness issues, any of that stuff, seriously take a break.
1514483	1515263	One other quick email.
1515283	1518005	This came to us from Justin M.,
1519126	1521246	This came to my email box, not the normal mailbag.
1521367	1524727	I don't know if you've heard yet, but they're making a movie of DOA.
1525087	1525747	It looks awesome.
1525787	1526768	It comes out this August.
1527508	1528688	Awesome or awful?
1529328	1531188	Sorry, got to disagree with you there.
1531268	1537610	Yes, we know the Dead or Alive movie is coming, but as to the fact that it looks awesome, I suppose if you're into tits and ass, it'll be great.
1538090	1539510	Or in Charlie's Angels.
1541130	1543111	Yeah, the first Charlie's Angels was good.
1543151	1544291	The second Charlie's Angels was...
1545810	1552821	Second Charlie's Angels If you believe that, I'd like to sell you this Alone in the Dark DVD I have Stop.
1553542	1554003	Be nice.
1555545	1556968	Be nice to the people who email me.
1557386	1561627	All right, if you have an email you want to send us, send it over to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
1561907	1564428	DarkSakura will be back next week to read those emails.
1564848	1571890	And yes, we will be doing a show next week on Easter Sunday because we have nothing better to do because our families don't love us and didn't invite us over.
1572650	1573311	No, I'm teasing.
1573611	1573971	Mine did.
1574171	1574411	I know.
1574611	1581793	Mine did too, but I don't know about your house, but Easter dinner at my house is like 2 o'clock, so it leaves me plenty of time to do this program.
1581813	1582113	We'll see.
1582433	1582673	All right.
1583453	1583793	Loki.
1583813	1583893	Yes.
1585054	1585414	Yes.
1586209	1586989	Cancelled games?
1587449	1587809	What's up?
1588190	1601794	Yes, unfortunately, if you're, you know, really looking forward to spending the night on the internet with people and having virtual sex, think again.
1602334	1608636	Spend the night, the MMO that was going to be put out, basically the sex MMO, cancelled!
1610336	1614177	Difficulty raising funds, I guess, is the reason for that.
1615518	1615658	And
1616601	1622465	So it's on hold indefinitely until they can make the money to pay the virtual prostitutes that are going to be in the game.
1622485	1622845	I don't know.
1623365	1624366	Imagine that.
1624426	1626047	The sex game couldn't get funding.
1626807	1628008	And there was much rejoicing.
1628769	1629269	No, no.
1629489	1630110	I disagree.
1630250	1631170	Because you know what?
1631691	1640556	Why is it that we have a bazillion violent games, yet when we look at sex-related games, we have the guy game.
1641337	1642417	Playboy Mansion.
1644298	1644939	You know, it's...
1646637	1653520	I would like to see a sexual game that's not super crappy.
1653900	1655460	And you think this was that game?
1656161	1660702	Okay, maybe not, but I don't know.
1661702	1665744	I don't think we should be frowning on it just because it's a sex game.
1665784	1668185	I mean, there's plenty of violent games out there that are okay.
1669912	1673594	Yeah, but you have to understand, murder okay, sex not okay.
1673994	1675675	Sex gets companies sued.
1675735	1677436	How do you make the people to murder?
1677696	1678096	Sex.
1681097	1681397	Right?
1681557	1682678	Where's the logic here?
1683178	1684979	Shouldn't it be murder bad, sex good?
1684999	1687160	What was hot coffee?
1687280	1688020	Sex game.
1688481	1689701	What was Grand Theft Auto?
1689801	1690502	Murder game.
1690782	1693503	Murder game okay, sex game not okay.
1694659	1703805	I agree with your point, but I'm way more comfortable leveling with the party of MMO players than I am cybering with them with these 3D avatars.
1703945	1704125	I'm sorry.
1704185	1705626	Dude, people do it anyway.
1708408	1712251	Your guild, obviously, in World of Warcraft is not as cool as mine, okay?
1715307	1718190	My guild is called World of Wank and they're a great time.
1718210	1718550	No, I'm kidding.
1718570	1719310	I'm totally joking.
1719331	1720391	I hope you people don't think I'm serious.
1720892	1724195	But don't you think people do this in MMOs as it is?
1725075	1725476	Come on.
1727618	1728919	The roleplay servers?
1728959	1729860	What do you think that is?
1729880	1731101	What do you think that's a front for?
1731461	1732262	Roleplay?
1732402	1732922	Hello.
1733403	1734784	That's what Sims Online was.
1735004	1738047	Yeah, that's exactly what Sims Online turned into.
1738067	1739368	It was one giant Vegas.
1742270	1742711	Hmm.
1745604	1747297	If you are a fan of music games...
1748390	1749430	This story is kind of old.
1749490	1750591	Why is this on the show roll?
1750631	1750991	I don't know.
1751051	1752592	Because I forgot to post it last week.
1752652	1753252	All right, fine.
1754012	1755033	Then fine.
1755573	1766238	You may have already heard this, but Red Octane CEO Kelly Sumner revealed last week that there are products in development, other products in development.
1766758	1770380	This guy used to be with Take-Two Interactive Europe, but now he's with Red Octane.
1770780	1777663	Can't tell you what the games are and when they're coming, but we kind of believe it's probably not just the Guitar Hero sequels.
1778163	1781364	Perhaps this is a rival to Konami's Bomani brand?
1782004	1782524	Who knows?
1783444	1784104	Could be interesting.
1785604	1790245	Because I think Beat Mania would have been a good game for them to compete with.
1790605	1791525	Do you think they'd still do it?
1791865	1793706	You say rival, I say cheap knockoff.
1793946	1796786	Okay, wait a minute though.
1797266	1801787	Maybe when you look at In The Groove DDR, I see your point there, despite the fact that it's still controversial.
1801867	1805068	But Guitar Hero vs. Guitar Freaks, I don't think that was a cheap knockoff.
1805568	1805908	I don't.
1806801	1813728	I think Guitar Hero was original enough and did a lot of... Obviously, most of the critics out there, 99% of them feel the same way I do.
1814889	1822516	Yeah, because 99% of the critics out there, they don't know the history of the music game series out there and they also don't do the research.
1823437	1823617	So...
1825757	1826637	Death to them all!
1826657	1827758	Death to them all!
1847055	1858440	It's a cool game because it's new to us, the US and stuff, but to be honest, when these next few games come out, or the next sequel or whatever, it's just going to be like a whole Guitar Freaks thing.
1858680	1862642	I mean, granted, I'm not saying Guitar Freaks is innovative because it's been the same damn game since Fifth Mix.
1862662	1866844	They've been just cookie-cuttering the whole thing along the way, but still.
1867984	1869425	Spike, you have Adam first, then I'll go.
1870686	1874347	Now, I definitely prefer Guitar Freaks to Guitar Hero.
1874868	1883491	I do not like Guitar Hero, but as a musician, I will say that playing Guitar Hero is way closer to playing an actual instrument.
1883871	1886812	And I think that in that way, it's actually a superior game.
1887152	1891994	Even if I don't prefer it myself, I think that on a technical level, it's a much more impressive work.
1892114	1895235	Okay, here's my deal, and I'm taking the music out of this equation.
1895335	1899737	I'm not even considering the music in Guitar Freaks and music in Guitar Hero, because that's a matter of opinion.
1900437	1902238	Just putting the game engines side by side.
1902578	1905720	Guitar Hero has way more of the fun factor in it.
1905960	1908602	Guitar Freaks, turn it on, pick your song, go.
1908702	1909582	Turn it on, pick your song, go.
1909802	1918507	Guitar Hero has that whole like, oh, you're in a band and you have the shops where you can upgrade your guitars and unlock the songs and you do the whammy and there's a crowd there and they're yelling for you.
1918747	1922329	Whereas Guitar Freaks is, here, look at this choppy animation while you play your song.
1923170	1925691	There's a lot to be said there that makes it more of a party game.
1925751	1928433	Okay, so you upgrade your guitar, which does what?
1929409	1931472	Oh, it changes the appearance of your guitar in the game.
1931712	1932453	Whoop-a-dee-doo.
1932774	1934276	There's a crowd!
1934336	1936539	What does Guitar Freaks have?
1936800	1937180	Nothing.
1937541	1938542	It doesn't have any of that.
1939423	1940905	It has the fact that it was first.
1942007	1942568	Have at it.
1945336	1948738	Don't call it an original game, call it an improvement of another game.
1949658	1957983	I will give you that because when I play Guitar Hero, it really does feel to me like I am playing Guitar Freaks mixed with Amplitude.
1958223	1958744	Exactly.
1958984	1962346	But with more of the fun factor for me.
1962826	1966468	There's a reason why it's so accessible to people.
1966808	1968189	I don't mind it being a good game.
1968469	1971651	I hate the fact that people are calling it innovative because it's not.
1972199	1975542	You know, granted, it may be more realistic to, you know, playing a guitar.
1975742	1977945	Doesn't make it innovative, makes it better, okay?
1978605	1983350	And also the fact that people are, you know, kind of basically posing this as an original game.
1983450	1984271	It's not an original game.
1984311	1985912	It fucking rips off three different games.
1986173	1987634	Puts the best things of them together.
1988075	1989436	Granted, that's a good idea.
1989636	1993240	It's basically improving on those concepts, but it's not an original game.
1993800	1994481	You know, I'm just...
1995546	1997809	I hate people calling it original and innovative.
1998350	2000773	Katamari Damacy, that was original.
2001434	2004318	This is not original.
2005139	2006141	Comments from our chatroom.
2006201	2009806	GS191 says the only reason people like Guitar Hero is because of the music.
2009886	2012770	The majority of America does not like the whole techno J-pop theme.
2014164	2014985	Interesting point there.
2015945	2023251	We also have, let's say, FireBoma says, if you showed critics Guitar Freaks, they'd say it was a rip-off of Guitar Hero at this point in time.
2023271	2026374	And I'd agree with you, but that's just, you know, a lot of critics are ignorant.
2026794	2027375	They're ignorant.
2027935	2035101	Because you watch, if they decide to release Guitar Freaks over here, people are like, why are they ripping off Guitar Hero?
2036042	2036642	What the hell?
2036702	2039104	This is a crappy Guitar Hero knockoff.
2040245	2043788	Seriously, I'm going to fucking beat those people to death is what's going to happen.
2044572	2058300	I don't know if Spike's laughing at the same thing I am, but DarkTetsuya wrote in the chatroom, ignorant, but he capitalized the first three letters of that word, and I'll just let you kind of dream up what he's trying to say there.
2060426	2061107	I'll leave it to you.
2061687	2065029	And then of course our chat room is just going off with what the mystery game could be.
2065810	2078318	DJ Poo Eater suggests Banjo Freaks, Fireboma suggests Clarinet Hero, DJ Poo Eater, Flute Hero, Hit Stun, Xylophone Hero, Drum Hero says Dark Knight, which I think a lot of us are thinking might be it.
2079038	2079699	You know, why not?
2080039	2084962	If they're going to rip off Guitar Freaks, why don't they rip off Drum Mania while they're at it?
2085022	2085783	I mean, seriously.
2087278	2092422	I would not be surprised if that's the big surprise game at E3 is Drum Hero or whatever they call it.
2094163	2098505	Spirit Snare would like to point out people in reviews have actually nodded to Guitar Freaks at least once.
2099446	2101887	Depends what site you're reading it from, but you are right.
2101927	2104309	I have seen those reviews that have been good enough to do that.
2105730	2107071	Alright, moving on to a new topic.
2107191	2107671	Loki.
2109332	2113915	I thought this game was already out, but there's a new game coming to the PlayStation 2 and PSP.
2115353	2116753	Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift
2144375	2145077	Lame!
2145097	2145819	Wait, for real?
2145859	2148346	There's a Fast and the Furious 3 Tokyo Drift coming out?
2148386	2148687	Yes.
2149268	2149990	Seriously.
2150051	2151474	Isn't that just initial D the movie?
2152714	2155175	The funny thing is, it doesn't even have Paul Walker.
2155235	2157195	It has a guy who looks like Paul Walker.
2157215	2158416	I thought Paul Walker was in that.
2158816	2160236	No, Paul Walker is in that movie.
2160456	2161937	Someone was telling me a guy who looks like Paul Walker.
2161957	2164898	No, Paul Walker is in that movie because Paul Walker has no work other than that.
2164918	2166558	Is it Paul Walker Goes to Tokyo?
2166618	2167219	Is that the plot?
2167299	2168059	It's stupid.
2168539	2170480	Paul Walker versus the Asian Mafia?
2170540	2173420	It's basically, ooh, the Asian chick who's hot.
2173580	2177702	Let's bring her back and let's bring Paul Walker back because we need somebody from the original series.
2177722	2178262	Maybe they'll have sex.
2178802	2182104	And yeah, maybe they'll have sex and she'll get all hot and schoolgirl-like.
2185766	2187007	Well, too bad.
2187167	2188167	No one's going to miss him.
2188307	2192129	So, you know, does this movie have Vin Diesel in it?
2192329	2195851	Okay, Ranma in our chat room would like to point this out and I'm almost positive he's right here.
2196252	2199934	Fast and the Furious was already in the arcade and it was based on the L.A.
2199994	2200554	Rush engine.
2201633	2202334	I'm sure it was.
2202634	2205277	But anyways, this game is going to be coming out.
2205377	2214448	What's unique about it, well, I'm not sure if it's unique, but it's kind of cool, is they're going to have 500 body kits from authentic manufacturers.
2214488	2216410	So you're actually going to have real upgrade parts.
2217291	2217411	And...
2219063	2224004	It's also going to feature boss races as well as advanced rubber band artificial intelligence systems.
2224244	2228885	I fucking hate goddamn advanced rubber band artificial intelligence systems.
2229105	2235147	You're racing, you're kicking the AI's ass, and all of a sudden, they're going 500 fucking miles to catch up to you.
2235447	2236107	I don't think so.
2236147	2241588	If you're fucking outracing them... I love it in Initial D because I'm always behind in the race.
2241708	2248070	I'll be racing a friend, I'm always behind, and then it totally favors you on the last lap, and then right at the finish line, I get ahead of them, and they're like,
2250052	2255816	Seriously, when I'm playing Burnout or something like that, I will have destroyed the car I'm racing as.
2255916	2263220	Racing against one car, and I've already almost slapped the guy, and all of a sudden he's going Mach 7 down this goddamn freeway.
2263480	2264381	They catch up to me.
2264781	2266342	So, I hate that shit.
2266402	2269164	But anyways, this game's coming out.
2269204	2271185	PlayStation 2, PSP only.
2273927	2275227	Check it out if it looks good.
2275367	2275808	I don't know.
2275848	2277949	To be honest, it's just going to be another racing game, and
2278390	2282814	Their Midnight Club 3 dub edition remix just came out, what, a few weeks ago?
2283876	2284816	It's like 1999.
2285337	2286899	Buy that instead.
2286939	2287679	I mean, seriously.
2288300	2289962	Don't encourage them to make more movies.
2291289	2294891	I didn't say by... No, no, that's what I'm saying.
2294951	2298473	I'm saying to the youth of America, do not encourage these people to make Fast and the Furious 4.
2298973	2303455	Seriously, who the hell is in this that's, you know, what, the Asian chick now is in this, okay?
2303835	2305076	Was Vin Diesel in this?
2305196	2305476	No.
2305536	2306617	Was Paul Walker in this?
2306797	2307157	No.
2307497	2308077	That's sad.
2308138	2315781	Ranma in our chatroom is saying, hey, the Fast and the Furious 3 will own, for one reason, Keiko Kirikawa, who is Sailor Mars.
2316182	2320564	Yeah, the only... The Asian chick, as I'm dubbing her, okay?
2321677	2331466	By the way, she's lending her likeness to other really fun movies like the Dead or Alive movie, which sucks balls, by the way.
2331586	2332467	You haven't seen it.
2332887	2335489	I've seen the trailer, and it sucks balls.
2335970	2338092	You can't judge a movie based off the trailer.
2338112	2341615	Dude, the trailer is fucking, you know, let's rip off.
2342828	2351703	Charlie's Angels 2 I'm trying to think of a movie that had a great trailer that sucked balls Because if that's true, the reverse would be true What's a movie with a great trailer that sucked balls?
2354252	2358755	I want to say Fantastic Four, but I haven't seen it, so I can't really dog on it.
2358815	2359996	Okay, how about this?
2360016	2361818	The Transporter 1 and 2.
2361978	2362918	Okay, there you go.
2363199	2363739	Good call.
2363919	2364480	Good call.
2364540	2365641	So, Transporter 1 and 2.
2365781	2367922	How about Freddy vs. Jason, maybe?
2368302	2370804	Like, you know, you see the trailer and you go, that's a fucking great concept.
2371085	2373046	You go and see the movie and you're like, what the fuck?
2373066	2374367	Did I just waste $10 on?
2374867	2375408	No, I'm just teasing.
2375428	2376128	It wasn't that bad.
2376168	2378430	I can't really rag on it.
2379191	2380972	But yeah, I mean, you get my point.
2382680	2384723	Freddy vs. Jason was supposed to be cheesy.
2384924	2385885	That's the whole point.
2386526	2390833	And it'll be just like Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash, if they ever do that.
2391474	2392195	Which I wish they would.
2392595	2394118	Completely off-topic here.
2394138	2395720	Has anyone actually seen XXX2 or whatever?
2399043	2400223	No, why would I do that?
2400243	2400724	It's great, though.
2400744	2401664	I haven't seen XXX1.
2401944	2403424	They have this hilarious thing, though.
2403464	2408286	It's this bonus thing where they're talking about what happened to the original XXX character and Vin Diesel's character.
2408866	2414708	And the way they've done it, they've shot... Every shot you see of XXX is just the back of him because it's not Vin Diesel.
2415128	2418729	But they kill him off really bad.
2419229	2424651	That was that episode of South Park where they spliced all of Isaac Hayes' lines together to get Shaft.
2426211	2427272	Hello, children!
2428072	2430095	Would you like to make love?
2430315	2430915	And that whole thing.
2431356	2431596	Yeah.
2431817	2433198	Alright.
2433318	2434260	New story, please.
2434300	2434720	Thank you.
2435000	2440527	Namco has new... Namco Bandai, I should say, has new plug-and-play controllers they're going to be releasing.
2440847	2443591	It's called Let's TV Play Classic.
2445117	2450020	These controllers will plug directly into your TV and have four playable games, two old ones, two new ones.
2450440	2456003	Namco Nostalgia has the retro Dragon Buster and new Dragon Buster 100.
2457324	2460445	Retail price is just under $30 US.
2460765	2463267	When I'm curious, are they going to have some of those other Namco things they've upgraded?
2463567	2470010	I see Mappy, and it looks like Xevious on one of these box arts there, so there might be some kind of cool stuff.
2470030	2472772	By the way, before you start thanking Namco for this kind of stuff...
2473112	2475753	Obviously, Namco is putting out the Fast and the Furious game.
2477554	2479355	So, reserve your hate.
2480996	2481596	Well said.
2484017	2485758	Loki, it's tax season, right?
2486158	2486939	Who missed the memo?
2487439	2489820	Apparently, Capcom in Japan.
2490480	2491681	Yeah, either...
2493407	2498690	They failed to report approximately 5.12 billion yen.
2499070	2503393	That's about 44 million dollars in the US.
2503894	2511639	And over the course of six years, the penalty is about 1.2 billion yen or 10 million dollars in the US.
2512899	2516922	And so because of this, actually they delayed Dead Rising.
2517282	2519744	It was one of the games that's being delayed right now because of that.
2520402	2523004	And, um, yeah, it's kind of interesting.
2524786	2525006	Oops.
2525947	2526987	Slight oversight there.
2527348	2528509	Oh, we have the file taxes?
2529610	2532212	That seems like a reasonable mistake.
2534013	2534493	Sure.
2535674	2540778	We were just talking about Namco a minute ago, and there's an announcement kind of circulating this week.
2540999	2545022	Old school Namco games are soon going to be available on Xbox Live Arcade because...
2545509	2562036	you know, making that Namco collection that they released on Xbox making it backwards compatible just wouldn't be good enough let's milk some more money out of this franchise and let's put these games on Xbox Live so people can whore gamer points even more Pac-Man and Galaga are on their way to Xbox Live Arcade
2562356	2563877	Complete with leaderboards!
2564217	2564577	Woo!
2564677	2565437	And achievements!
2565557	2570099	I can't possibly fathom what achievements will be available on Pac-Man.
2570859	2571699	You ate a ghost!
2571879	2572419	Ding!
2572439	2572759	20 points!
2573019	2574400	And yet you're gonna buy them, aren't you?
2574480	2576441	Probably, because I'm a sad, sad man.
2576481	2578601	You know, hasn't Pac-Man been on like every system?
2579141	2579322	Ever?
2579362	2579942	Probably.
2580682	2580802	Yeah.
2581274	2581694	Probably.
2582075	2584577	So this really isn't much of a surprise, honestly.
2584938	2587641	Well, just the fact that it's coming to the Xbox Live Arcade, I guess, is a surprise.
2587961	2592926	But notice how Namco Museum, or actually, no, I think the Namco Museum, actually, I might be wrong.
2593006	2594508	I think it is backwards compatible.
2594988	2598652	I think that 50th one, I think I do remember seeing it on the backwards compatibility list.
2598672	2599513	I think you can play it.
2599693	2600354	Doesn't matter anyways.
2600394	2602336	If you had a Ridge Racer, you could play it anyways.
2602977	2603798	Oh, I guess that's true.
2604411	2606672	That's a very good point.
2606692	2611233	But they want you to pay $5 or maybe even $10, who knows, for leaderboards and what have you.
2611514	2612494	Now, here's an idea.
2613094	2623358	How about a port of the Pac-Man Versus like you had on the Game Boy Advance that you could hook into the GameCube where you could play it on Xbox Live and some of your friends are the ghosts?
2624249	2624989	and you're the Pac-Man.
2625149	2626590	Now, wouldn't that be a lot better?
2626950	2628351	Wouldn't that make my money more worthwhile?
2628371	2628671	How about this?
2628711	2635354	Instead of just porting over the original Pac-Man, how about you port over one of the Pac-Man remakes that they have, you know, where the graphics are at least a little bit better?
2635634	2635955	Mm-hmm.
2636095	2641237	Where, you know, it might utilize the widescreen, you know, like it did on the PSP, but no.
2641657	2647400	No, we have to port over the original one and put some art on the side there because, yeah, it's great.
2648322	2649543	Yeah.
2649583	2652364	Ranma in the chatroom says, Fuck Pac-Man vs. I want Pac-Mania.
2653184	2653705	I want them both.
2653825	2656426	Why don't we just get like a small Pac-Man anthology there?
2656666	2657006	Come on.
2657907	2659907	For five bucks for old games, come on.
2660208	2661888	You can give me some other old Pac-Mania.
2661908	2663029	You can give me Pac-Mania.
2663329	2668291	You can give me Pac-Man 91 or whatever it was when they did the souped up versions.
2668532	2669072	Give me some of that.
2671193	2671513	Sigh.
2672915	2673256	Loki.
2673896	2675338	Oh, wait, first I want to mention this.
2676320	2677101	GamerPoints.
2677221	2689257	I was reading the Xbox forums this week and I saw some person say that they had rented Top Spin 2 and that they had figured out a way for them and their friend to play on Xbox Live and whore up the GamerPoints.
2689617	2692820	by, because if you quit out of a match, you still get credit for playing the match.
2693140	2696743	So it was really easy to unlock the 25 and 50 matches gamer points.
2697403	2701086	Is it ethical to do this, to cheat your way to getting these gamer points?
2701346	2708532	How about renting games, getting the points, or basically renting games just for the sole purpose of milking out as many points as you can.
2708592	2709072	Is that ethical?
2709312	2712895	Well, renting games, I wouldn't say it's not ethical.
2713035	2716678	I would say that you just, you know, probably could be doing better things with your time and money.
2717459	2717559	Um...
2718660	2726622	If you're playing the games to actually get the points correctly, then that's your prerogative if you want to go and rent these really crappy games to get the points out of them.
2727882	2732142	As far as cheating to get points, I don't think it's right, but I do it.
2735183	2746345	I don't go as far as quitting games and stuff like that to cheat, but for example, Far Cry has cheat codes, and Ubisoft, they let you get achievement points with the cheat codes, and they have the same thing with Ghost Recon.
2747363	2752025	It's their own damn fault that they didn't program it in there where you can't get the achievement with those.
2752646	2757008	The outfit has cheat codes, but you don't get achievement points if you have them on.
2758588	2762170	The outfit sucks, by the way, but I don't know.
2762290	2764151	I think it's their own fault for that.
2766072	2770754	Yeah, I guess it's wrong that they're cheating, but I don't know.
2771034	2772815	I don't see a problem with them or any games.
2774176	2774496	I don't know.
2774576	2776599	I think I agree with your point.
2777140	2780344	I don't think it's renting the games to get the points that's so bad.
2780364	2786933	I've borrowed games from you, and I've worked my way to getting achievement points, but I would never cheat the system to do it.
2786953	2789716	That whole quitting in and out thing, that was just stupid.
2791477	2795740	I'm, you know, if I notice that, yeah, I'm going to get 10 points if I do this special little thing.
2796141	2799023	Maybe I'll go to, it's like in Geometry Wars, right?
2799263	2802185	Who's going to sit there for 60 seconds dodging all the monsters?
2802245	2803727	You wouldn't usually think to do that.
2804087	2806068	But, you know, hey, it was worth 10 points.
2806108	2806789	I'll give it a try.
2806989	2808410	You know, it's a little bit of a challenge.
2808430	2810512	Makes, you know, a little task.
2810572	2811733	It's kind of like a mission.
2812113	2813074	I sort of think of it that way.
2813394	2815294	I don't think there's anything unethical about doing that.
2815334	2819275	Now, you can't really rent a game like Geometry Wars, but I think that theory applies.
2819295	2822056	If you're going to rent games and accomplish as much as you can, I think that's okay.
2822296	2826417	But I think when you resort to cheating and those things, I don't think that's okay.
2827237	2829277	Specifically for the purpose of getting gamer points.
2829337	2831778	I mean, if you're cheating your way through the game, then whatever.
2831818	2832678	You've already made that decision.
2832718	2836979	But I do think Xbox should figure out a way to disable gamer points when you're cheating.
2837239	2840320	My point... But if the developers left it in there, that's their own downfall.
2840360	2844021	My point with Far Cry, for example, the game's hard enough even when you are cheating.
2844121	2844761	So, you know what?
2845001	2848442	It's just added fun for my... They don't have an infinite health code.
2848662	2854543	They just have infinite ammo and infinite, like, feral or your adrenaline or whatever.
2854883	2856184	And it's still really fun.
2856224	2857124	It's still really hard.
2857784	2861245	And it just makes it so where I don't have to go and try to collect ammo and
2861564	2863226	Fireboma wants to know, what do the gamer points do?
2877011	2877832	Nothing!
2878072	2879294	They really aren't anything.
2879935	2881377	It's an internet penis thing.
2881657	2884181	The more points you have, the bigger your internet penis is.
2884301	2886804	I mean, even if you're a girl, you know what I'm talking about.
2887064	2891210	I'm talking about that whole, you know, look at me, I'm cool because I have, you know, 50 million gamer points.
2891751	2891971	You know?
2892191	2893272	I think that's pretty cool.
2893292	2894012	I think it's cool too.
2917489	2919731	DJ PooEater would like to know, is it virtual boobs for the girl gamers?
2919791	2922452	No, Roz in the chatroom says, my e-penis, hers is 12 miles long on a cold day.
2947247	2949248	That's quite the impressive e-penis there.
2950768	2952389	Also, what was the other comment in here I saw?
2952409	2955290	Oh, GS191 said, great, point whoring.
2955350	2957331	What's next, the achievement point police?
2958691	2960372	Head on over to the Xbox Live forums.
2960392	2964953	There are some people on there that have their panties in a bunch that people are cheating their way to getting these points.
2968495	2968835	All right.
2970145	2975069	We're going to open up the Skype line very, very soon over at our website, www.orangeloundtrader.com.
2975109	2980674	Click on Interact With Us, and you can call us on the Skype line to talk about anything that you want to here this last month.
2981001	2984183	A few minutes of the show open forum, but first, a couple quick notes.
2984743	2990927	First off, the other contest we promised we were going to do tonight, we are also doing a giveaway tonight for Amped 3.
2992247	2994769	This is the action-packed snowboarding game for the Xbox 360.
2995669	2997390	Now, Loki, you actually own this game, right?
2997450	3000432	I have to be honest, I haven't played this yet, but Loki, you own this.
3000652	3002954	I owned it, sold it, bought it back because I liked it.
3003174	3003474	But, uh...
3004294	3005114	What do you do in this game?
3005154	3005895	It's snowboarding?
3005995	3006455	It's snowboarding.
3006475	3010736	The only thing that turned me off about it is because it didn't have live support because it would have been pretty sweet live.
3011116	3013317	But it's your snowboarding game type thing.
3013557	3020519	What's kind of cool about it is they have hang gliding in there as well, snowmobiles, sleds, which are pretty cool, and the sleds are fun.
3021309	3023150	and it's just a really weird game.
3023570	3027731	The cutscenes are done with weird comics, sock puppets.
3027851	3030232	Yeah, I see a little pink bunny on the back of the box there.
3030252	3031192	That has my interest right there.
3031212	3032453	It's really acid trippy.
3032593	3035113	It reminds me of MTV2 or something like that.
3035674	3036954	Like Wonder Shosen or something?
3037534	3039535	Yeah, very Wonder Shosen-ish.
3039995	3041096	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3057435	3060677	Or if you're feeling like a cheap bastard, you can win one right now.
3060757	3066121	Just send an email to snow at orangeloungeradio.com and that's all you have to do.
3066281	3068103	We're not going to make you name anything.
3068163	3071705	Just send an email to snow at orangeloungeradio.com and say, I want to win.
3072086	3077209	Plus, if you're an achievement point hoard, there are some pretty easy achievement points in there.
3077409	3079511	And it's got a terrain editor, which is kind of neat.
3079611	3080492	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3109790	3114893	But hey, if you don't have a 360, I was actually at Fry's today and they had some there.
3114913	3116154	Oh, they're making their way around now.
3116194	3117635	You can get a 360 now.
3119196	3121917	Yeah, so just to clarify, some folks in our chatroom are saying, is this for PS2?
3122017	3124059	No, this is Xbox 360 Amp 3.
3125820	3126920	Amp 2 and Amp 1?
3127561	3129002	Those are Xbox, I think.
3129042	3130443	I don't think you get those on PS2.
3131123	3134325	It's made by 2K Games, who also made Top Spin 2, which I talked about earlier in the show.
3135885	3138506	Alright, we can't wait to give stuff away next week.
3138526	3145749	We'll be pulling for not just that, but the 24 game we gave away in Part A. And if you missed it, listen to Part A, because we'll tell you how to win the 24 game.
3147189	3155652	Loki, Lara Croft, I bashed the Tomb Raider demo earlier in the show, but at least there's some good news coming Lara Croft's way.
3156272	3160614	Yes, Lara Croft, don't ask me why, I really don't know why.
3161863	3168088	She's earned a Guinness World Record as the most successful video game heroine.
3169129	3171871	To which I ask, what about Mrs. Pac-Man?
3173132	3173452	Seriously.
3174053	3177796	What kind of a fucking record is that anyways?
3178236	3178957	That's not a record.
3179177	3181078	She didn't eat the most chili dogs in the world.
3181439	3185382	She didn't grow the longest carrot.
3185442	3187624	She's just a fake person.
3189306	3189746	in a game.
3190086	3197888	And so, okay, over the past 10 years, Lord Croft has sold, they've sold over 28 million games worldwide in the Tomb Raider series.
3198349	3209512	It's appeared on stage with U2 and covers over 200 magazines and more recently, of course, Angelina Jolie put out two really awful movies.
3210192	3210352	And
3211755	3223003	Yeah, and they have even over, it's a $1 billion industry with items from lunchboxes, soft drinks, motor vehicles, and receiving the Lord Croft brand treatment.
3223063	3228828	What kind of fucking vehicle has Tomb Raider edition or something like that?
3228968	3230389	I have not heard of that, but.
3233007	3236309	All that news in the world did not make that demo any better, I'm sorry to say.
3236509	3237129	And you know what?
3237409	3238510	You know what I have to ask, though?
3238990	3242392	Is Guinness Book losing its edge?
3242832	3245574	I mean, are they just letting anyone come into this book nowadays?
3246014	3247515	I mean, even fake people.
3248075	3251377	I mean, I can understand if someone did a speed run through Tomb Raider.
3251777	3253398	Could we get a world record for something?
3254559	3256600	How about most Guinness drank on a podcast?
3256920	3257741	We might be able to do that.
3259369	3260369	I'll join in for that one.
3285821	3294183	Uh, well, once again, I am sitting around playing Advance Crack after being sick for all of last week, which is why I didn't call.
3294423	3295464	Did you get Jamie sick?
3297404	3298445	Uh, maybe.
3300065	3303986	Alright, well, what did you call in to talk to us about tonight?
3304006	3307107	Was one of our stories you have some feedback to or anything?
3307830	3311292	Well, we could talk about my wonderful e-penis if you'd like.
3311592	3314414	It actually has a name and a holiday.
3315194	3320257	I was actually going to suggest, because I remember you were mentioning about your large e-penis earlier.
3320537	3329502	Is it appropriate for me to be saying that girls who have a lot of achievement points on Xbox Live or other types of online accomplishments have an e-penis, or is that sexist?
3329822	3330122	All right.
3330362	3330842	Just making sure.
3330862	3331823	It's absolutely acceptable.
3331863	3333444	Mine has a name, actually.
3333864	3333964	Oh.
3334745	3335925	I call it General Grant.
3336345	3337046	General Grant.
3337066	3337126	Yes.
3337901	3339202	Yes.
3339262	3341103	Why do you call your EP-ness General Grant?
3343384	3345346	It all started one night.
3346146	3353551	I think it was actually March 29th, which is our made-up holiday.
3355152	3357133	And I just came up with it.
3357173	3358474	I just thought of the name and...
3360685	3374132	You know what, there's some guys out there that name their, you know, I ain't talking about E, okay, they name their real deal, and usually it's just because, now I don't, sorry, but usually it's just, you know, because they think of it one random night.
3374172	3381276	Maybe when they're high or something, I don't know, but it comes to them in a dream, and suddenly it has a name.
3382536	3383477	I can understand that.
3385026	3390147	SpiritSnare would like to point out in our chat room, you named your e-penis, you win the podcast.
3390307	3390967	Congratulations.
3391568	3396409	And Gizm would like to know, or Gizm, I hope it's not Gizm, that might be bad.
3396789	3401810	Gizm says, sorry buddy, sorry, sorry.
3402330	3403690	What am I listening to?
3403770	3404411	Ha, ha, ha.
3408592	3410412	You won the show and I just lost it.
3410492	3410852	Thank you.
3411612	3411992	Yay.
3412693	3412953	All right.
3413373	3414493	Roz, anything else on your mind?
3416111	3417512	Uh, Advance Wars.
3418032	3419733	Holy shit, it's so fun.
3420014	3421395	You're still playing that game?
3421435	3423736	Are you ever going to put it down and maybe try some Kingdom Hearts 2?
3424216	3424396	No.
3424777	3430901	Maybe I'll stop for a while and play more Phoenix Wright, but I don't think I'll move from those two.
3431181	3432742	Alright, well Phoenix Wright is a good game too.
3432762	3437845	The thing with Kingdom Hearts is that my PS2 is dead.
3438826	3440927	Like, really, really dead.
3441665	3445948	In a couple short months, the PS3 will be out, and then the PS2 is bound to get a price cut.
3446929	3452793	Yeah, that's probably a good thing for me, because my PS2 is dead, and I miss playing Akaji.
3453694	3456295	Roz, you should beg and plead maybe our chatters.
3456335	3458457	Maybe they'll take up a collection for a new PS2 for you.
3459197	3460458	Offer to show them General Grant.
3460899	3462720	Please, General Grant wants a PS2.
3462920	3463160	All right.
3463420	3466543	Roz, I've got to let you go so we can get to another call, but thank you so much for calling in, okay?
3467003	3467363	Okay, bye.
3467383	3467864	Have a good one.
3468104	3468384	Bye-bye.
3469298	3470138	Alright, let's go to another call.
3470158	3471259	We're getting hammered tonight, guys.
3471319	3472339	I'm not going to be able to get to everybody.
3472359	3472899	I'm so sorry.
3473320	3474600	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3474620	3475020	Who's this?
3478282	3479622	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3480923	3481623	Slam that door.
3481663	3482143	Who's this?
3483323	3485024	Hi, this is Spirit Snare.
3485484	3486385	Hi, Spirit Snare.
3486405	3487105	What's on your mind?
3487585	3489766	Why did you have to shut the door there?
3489786	3490986	Were you afraid somebody was going to hear me?
3493347	3494528	That was my brother, actually.
3495568	3496549	Tell him to stop being a brat.
3496609	3497269	Okay, what's on your mind?
3498335	3501459	Um, whatchamacallit, about Guitar Hero being innovative.
3502840	3515694	Yeah, um, I was actually surprised that you didn't, um, you guys didn't, like, you guys weren't outraged, like, um, whatchamacallit, back when it was announced over at the, um,
3516667	3522471	Over at the Game Developers Conference When Guitar Hero was first announced at E3?
3523172	3530017	No, when Guitar Hero was announced as being the most innovative at the GDC Oh yeah, what do you think about that, Loki?
3530037	3535361	You remember how Guitar Hero won the prize of most innovative among many other awards Guitar Hero's won this year?
3536902	3541526	He's making a jerk-off motion with his hand there, that's lovely It's retarded, let me put that out there
3542995	3543837	You know what, Loki?
3543877	3544939	I think you're in the minority.
3544979	3547525	I think a lot of people think... But I will say this, though.
3547746	3548106	I think...
3548894	3553655	Their amplitude, frequency should have been given more of those types of honors.
3553775	3559356	I mean, this is kind of like, okay, you know how the Grammys have a best new artist category every year?
3559696	3567097	And sometimes the person who wins the best new artist, this is actually like their fifth album, but they're just now getting noticed, right?
3567117	3567577	You know what I mean?
3568197	3569758	That's kind of what this reminds me of.
3569978	3575258	It's like, okay, it's not really a new concept, but they did it so well this time, we're going to notice them.
3576999	3578219	That's exactly what this is like to me.
3579907	3603074	Yeah, but even though Guitar Freaks was released way ahead of their time, even though it's a mixed-up concept and stuff, that really shouldn't have deserved the award.
3604963	3607966	Well, I guess everybody is open to their own opinion.
3608226	3610088	Anything else you want to share with us tonight, Spirit Snare?
3611670	3611870	No.
3612230	3612470	Okay.
3612610	3613371	Well, thanks for your call.
3613391	3614232	We appreciate it, okay?
3614913	3615273	Thank you.
3615293	3615673	Have a good one.
3615693	3616314	Thanks for listening.
3617315	3617555	All right.
3617595	3620018	Let's go to another call here.
3620058	3622800	Let's go to this one.
3623481	3623701	Hello.
3623741	3624822	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3625963	3626544	Hi, Sky.
3626704	3627725	It's me, Raven's Dolphin.
3627765	3628826	Hello, Raven's Dolphin.
3628846	3629527	What's on your mind, buddy?
3632220	3634821	I just want to comment on that achievement points.
3635201	3635441	Yes.
3637241	3637741	What do you want to say?
3639082	3640742	Well, I hate them.
3641602	3642303	Why do you hate them?
3643683	3647164	I only have 630 and all my friends got 1300.
3647924	3648264	I have 900.
3648564	3650144	I have more than you.
3650725	3653405	Oh, that's just great.
3655506	3660187	Is that the only reason you're upset is because you have a few points whereas a lot of people have more?
3662046	3665468	No, I'm just way too poor to buy $60 games.
3666068	3670150	What about the cheapy little $5 and $10 games you can get on Xbox Live?
3670210	3672931	Feeding Frenzy, 75 easy, easy points.
3672991	3675813	Crystal Quest, probably 100 easy points right there.
3677093	3679474	I'm saving my Microsoft points for Street Fighter.
3679494	3680575	I want to kick someone's ass.
3680595	3681095	There you go.
3681135	3684397	You know, Street Fighter is finally supposed to be coming out in, I think, April.
3684717	3686057	Finally, that will come out.
3686118	3688879	But, of course, they've been saying this, you know, for three months now.
3688959	3691240	But if they're going to fix the lag, I guess it's a good thing.
3693018	3700721	Yeah, that's what I'm excited for, but... Can I say one more thing?
3700801	3701221	Of course.
3704203	3707784	Okay, uh... The Mac bootcamp thing?
3710946	3714207	I think it's the greatest thing that Mac ever did, supporting Windows.
3714287	3714647	Yay!
3715147	3716288	Alright, yay indeed.
3716948	3718769	You can call me a hypocrite for nothing.
3720265	3721507	Alright, now I won't call you hypocrite.
3721527	3723129	I think it's a smart move for Mac as well.
3725112	3727676	Alright, have a good one, RavensDolphin.
3728637	3728958	See ya.
3729938	3731800	We're getting a little bit of lag there with Raven's Dolphin.
3731860	3733040	Maybe we'll do one more call.
3733101	3734482	I do want to say real fast, though.
3734802	3739205	Somebody said in chat room, let's see, where is it?
3739586	3742508	Oh, it really is pronounced jism.
3742568	3743589	That's how you say that name.
3743649	3745530	It's short for neologism.
3746051	3747452	So it's actually pronounced jism.
3747912	3749153	So I said the name right the first time.
3749193	3752335	I know I do not have something dirty on the brain, you freaking perverts.
3752576	3754557	I don't even know what you're talking about.
3754577	3755678	I don't even know what you're talking about.
3755718	3756719	That's how pure my soul is.
3757688	3758729	Zander from New Kineto, what's on your mind?
3777554	3779295	I didn't have a whole lot on my mind tonight.
3779395	3779895	Can you hear me?
3779995	3781155	I'm so glad that you called.
3781416	3783637	You better think of something quick to talk about.
3784597	3785758	No, I'm going to talk about something.
3786358	3786678	Okay.
3786698	3787899	Well, what is it?
3788619	3792921	The problem is I wanted to talk to Jamie about something, but she's not here tonight.
3793681	3795042	Can we pass on a message for you?
3795862	3797763	No, I'll just wait until whenever she's back.
3798103	3799964	What the hell did you call in for tonight?
3800284	3801245	Can we help you?
3802025	3803025	I have other things to talk about.
3803085	3804086	All right, well, you better bring it.
3805148	3806929	Yeah, I know I changed my location in SHJ.
3806969	3811213	Dang it, now I forgot.
3811693	3812514	No, no, I have it.
3812634	3813054	Don't hang up.
3813335	3813695	Alright.
3815316	3816217	Oh, Kingdom Hearts 2.
3816377	3817418	I beat it yesterday.
3817458	3818959	You beat Kingdom Hearts 2 already?
3819580	3819780	Yeah.
3819960	3820660	How is the ending?
3820680	3824043	And if you spoil it, I'll fly out to New Connecticut and choke you.
3825164	3825744	How is the ending?
3826565	3827206	It's good.
3827386	3830488	It's kind of similar to the first one, though.
3830768	3833731	In the sense that it ends with the king sending him a letter.
3835123	3836843	I said don't ruin the damn ending!
3836883	3837663	That's not a spoiler, dude.
3837723	3838064	Alright.
3838364	3839084	That's not a spoiler.
3839184	3839764	Alright, fine.
3840544	3842084	But, yeah, it's good.
3843264	3844785	The last boss battle is very good.
3845005	3847905	It kind of had a Wind Waker-like vibe to it, in a way.
3849966	3857267	You know, the way you killed off Ganondorf in the end, it kind of had a similar, like, really flashy... Oh, you spoiled Wind Waker for me!
3857287	3857787	Shut up!
3857827	3859427	Alright, was it worth the $50 you paid for it?
3865817	3871160	Honestly, I don't think many video games at all are worth $50, but I mean, I certainly had a great time with it.
3871560	3876623	I mean, maybe it was only like 30 hours, but, you know, it was a good 30 hours.
3877203	3881226	I mean, there were a few bosses I didn't like, because they're really annoying.
3881266	3882907	Did you spend three hours on the prologue?
3884067	3884267	Yes.
3884527	3886569	So that means 10% of the game is the prologue?
3887249	3887449	Yep.
3887969	3888650	That's amazing.
3888710	3889530	Spike, you had a question?
3890111	3894493	Okay, so my question for you is, did you get the hidden video at the end?
3895382	3897004	No, but I saw it before it even came out.
3898465	3898925	Oh man.
3899025	3899646	On the internet.
3900287	3908494	I heard it, it's, I can't even say, I don't want to spoil, but I heard it's what the hidden video in part one did for part two.
3909095	3909835	Essentially.
3910056	3912197	Are you banning me from asking my question on the air?
3912218	3914860	You cannot spoil the game or many people will kill you.
3917075	3918016	Send Spike an email.
3918076	3920459	You kids can Kingdom Hearts it out in email.
3921600	3924063	If you want to see the secret ending, just go to YouTube.
3924804	3925325	I've seen it.
3926061	3928102	Have some speculation about it.
3928122	3929142	We can't spoil, though.
3929683	3933284	Can you make it spoiler-free?
3933344	3934205	Can you make it spoiler-free?
3934805	3935065	Somehow?
3936205	3937826	I wouldn't be able to for what I want to say.
3938286	3938647	Alright.
3939887	3942208	Xander, we gotta let you go before something gets spoiled, okay?
3943629	3943929	Okay.
3944109	3944589	Have a good one.
3945129	3945790	Ansem's still alive.
3946050	3949231	I didn't even hear what he said.
3949271	3949731	What did he say?
3950012	3951912	He said Ansem's still alive.
3953953	3954453	You dick.
3955294	3955354	Um...
3958129	3958449	I lied.
3958469	3959249	We'll do one more call.
3959969	3961090	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3963510	3964070	Hello.
3964210	3964850	Hi, I lied.
3964870	3965651	I lied.
3965691	3966791	We decided to take one more call.
3966811	3967331	What's on your mind?
3970151	3973812	Um... Well... Oh, yeah, that.
3973872	3974312	I'm sick.
3975112	3976073	I'm sorry to hear that.
3976133	3977513	What does that have to do with tonight's show?
3978373	3979133	Um... No, I'm serious.
3979153	3979973	Get better soon.
3980053	3981574	You know, obviously something's going around.
3981774	3982354	Okay, seriously.
3982374	3982814	What's on your mind?
3984094	3984394	Okay.
3984874	3985695	Um, it's bothering me.
3985715	3986835	You guys keep saying Yen.
3986895	3987435	It's pronounced N.
3989630	3991051	Oh, the currency?
3992091	3992611	In Japan?
3993912	3996992	Well, you see, I'm a honky who can't pronounce Japanese words right.
3997032	4000493	You want to go out for some sushi?
4000853	4002014	Want to go get some sushi?
4004454	4005715	And some teriyaki?
4006435	4007955	Can I get some teriyaki chicken?
4011156	4012617	Yeah, alright, so I make mistakes.
4013077	4016198	You know what, that's why I'm on the internet radio and not on real radio, okay?
4019342	4021083	Anything else you want to say besides picking on me?
4022204	4023604	Yes, this is Nintendo Maniac 64.
4024905	4025905	Well, hi, Nintendo Maniac 64.
4026325	4030187	Or as I say, Fever Maniac 64.
4030227	4033328	All right, anything else on your mind tonight before I cut you off?
4033908	4039711	Yeah, my DS charger cable I've modded so I have headphone jacks on the cord.
4039971	4047434	I can plug in my AC adapter, a USB port, or get this, a mouse port plug.
4049828	4051650	Resident Evil 4, bitch.
4073160	4074281	Man, yeah.
4074361	4076562	I spent 30 hours on Kingdom Hearts this week.
4077422	4079143	My e-penis is huge.
4079163	4080123	I have a question for you.
4080143	4080903	God, I love our fans.
4081063	4081804	Yes, Loki.
4082024	4086966	So, USB port and mouse port.
4088607	4089307	What's the point?
4090568	4091148	Because you can.
4091348	4093109	Why do you install Linux on a toaster?
4093169	4093829	Because you can.
4093869	4095150	But you can't hook up a mouse to it.
4096450	4096630	Huh?
4098831	4102473	I mean, like, if I install the cigarette lighter on my PSP.
4103496	4104216	But I don't smoke.
4104997	4106217	But you would have it.
4108598	4109378	For what?
4110118	4113520	Alright, we're going to go around and get tonight's last minute stories.
4113600	4115420	Any last minute things people want to bring up?
4115480	4116681	Loki, you seem to always have something.
4117921	4122423	Yeah, I was going to mention there was some rumor stuff I was reading.
4122963	4127485	One of them saying that Final Fantasy 7, the remake, is in production for the PS3 right now.
4128408	4142585	that they're trying to also secure the rights for Grand Theft Auto the next Grand Theft Auto for the 360 to be exclusive which is not going to happen and oh god what was the other one that's all I got so far
4144002	4146664	Alright, I have a real last minute story here.
4146924	4149445	This is coming to us from GK128 in the chat room.
4149465	4151487	There's a post over on Nintendo forums.
4151767	4157230	Rumor is going around that Blue Wave may perhaps be the real name of the revolution.
4158231	4160993	Take into consideration the revolution has a blue light.
4161633	4163054	There's waving the controller.
4163094	4165555	There's the blue ocean thing people have been talking about.
4166016	4168077	Competition to Blu-ray perhaps.
4168797	4174762	This leak is coming from some type of audio link there from YourFileHost.com Check that out in our chat room.
4174802	4175842	We just posted the link there.
4175882	4178905	I'm sure if this is true, there will be plenty of more news about it in the next week.
4179385	4183528	Right now, take it as a rumor, the name of the revolution to be the Blue Wave, possibly.
4184048	4184328	I don't know.
4184348	4185469	You're retarded sounding.
4185509	4186070	I'm sorry.
4186090	4187110	I could see it.
4187170	4187691	I could see that.
4189512	4191813	I don't think it's as retarded as you're making it out to me.
4192333	4192573	Spike?
4192834	4194834	I really like the name Revolution.
4195055	4195515	I do too.
4195995	4197075	If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
4197215	4198456	I think that should be the name of it too.
4200157	4202178	I mean, because it's revolutionary.
4202398	4205839	It's, I don't know, you can revolve the controller around.
4206259	4208981	I'm doing little quotation marks with my fingers here.
4209161	4212142	It's catchy and buzzy.
4213042	4215824	I think that it's exactly what Nintendo needs to turn their image around.
4215884	4218745	Something that's going to make people say, hey, wait, this is different.
4219858	4220258	Possibly.
4221059	4221939	Any other last-minute stories?
4222379	4223080	Spike, do you have something?
4223320	4229103	Well, on Friday, actually, Capcom announced the Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded.
4229623	4233686	It's the follow-up compilation disc for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
4234966	4239889	Right now, the titles that have been announced for it are Eco Fighters, King of Dragons, Knights of the Round.
4240449	4245172	Also, it looks like some Commando, Ghouls and Ghosts, and Street Fighter II.
4245312	4247093	Okay.
4247728	4249210	Some of those games were in the last one.
4249470	4250151	That's kind of weird.
4250632	4253916	I don't get this press release, but it's there on the internet.
4254316	4256819	Kotaku posted a link, IGN posted a link.
4257901	4262507	Seems pretty kosher, but... Resident Evil 4, bitch.
4263388	4264689	Resident Evil 4, bitch.
4265691	4266672	Any other last minute stories?
4268339	4270040	Just the one I have.
4270220	4270540	All right.
4270700	4276222	I also want to say really quick, because somebody in the chat room reminded me to mention our panels at Fanime.
4276602	4277983	Yes, we are going to be going to Fanime.
4278023	4279864	We're doing panels that's still in the works.
4279944	4281604	DarkSakura would know more about that.
4282125	4284045	Just a reminder, that's Memorial Day weekend.
4284426	4288487	Not only are we going to be there, but Spike, you're going to Fanime as well, correct?
4288807	4289348	You're going to be there?
4289368	4290088	Oh, yeah.
4290108	4291328	I'm there just about every year.
4291508	4292829	And you'll be at our panels as well?
4294318	4294698	Hopefully.
4295119	4295339	Sure.
4295379	4295680	Please.
4296000	4296180	Yes.
4296541	4297762	And, well, you'll at least be there.
4297842	4299264	I don't know what we're doing for them yet.
4299304	4300145	I'll be present.
4300165	4301266	He'll be there to sign autographs.
4301686	4303589	And hopefully some of our other regulars.
4303629	4308414	I know Extrofer will probably be there, and maybe we can get Miklatop to come with us, too.
4308694	4309035	We'll see.
4309495	4311478	But that'll all go down at Foundame.
4311498	4312519	Okay, I have one more thing.
4312879	4313079	All right.
4313340	4313600	One more.
4314013	4316876	This is basically coming from the new issue of Game Informer.
4317717	4322101	First off, they're sticking by their information that the new Halo game is going to be called Forerunner.
4323042	4329269	They also revealed that a Project Orion is in existence.
4329409	4334214	Basically, it's supposed to be a team put together to explore the possibility of a Halo MMO.
4335915	4337357	It's still in the planning stages.
4338001	4338762	But it's going ahead.
4339762	4350549	Also, the Final Fantasy 7 remake for the PlayStation 3 is supposed to be going to have the Final Fantasy 12 action battle system in there.
4350569	4352591	So you're going to be in a real-time battle.
4354172	4356373	All rumors until we see some actual details.
4357214	4357494	All right.
4358773	4365338	That's about going to wrap it up for tonight's program, but not before we get to the last story of the evening, which comes to us from Loki.
4366178	4370101	We were going to make Jamie talk about this, but maybe this is why she called in tonight.
4370121	4370461	I don't know.
4370661	4375965	Well, I wanted to first real quick before I go over the last story, I just want to mention what's coming out this week.
4376125	4376425	Oh, sure.
4377566	4384771	If you are a PC gamer fan, they have Auto Assault Online Limited Edition with some bonus stuff.
4384911	4387633	Condemned is finally coming out on the PC.
4388533	4389555	GameCube has Odama
4404793	4408235	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4435353	4442856	Of course, on the PSP, we have the Silent Hill Experience coming out that coincided with the movie released next week.
4442896	4443677	They must have bumped that up.
4444457	4445357	I believe they have.
4446918	4454461	Silent Hill Experience, I thought around that time was supposed to be not the Silent Hill Experience, but the collection.
4455141	4455481	Interesting.
4455602	4458783	But I haven't really heard anything official on that, so I don't know.
4458923	4459203	Maybe.
4460103	4461624	So look for that.
4462424	4463105	See if it's coming.
4464707	4465908	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4491229	4495570	If you're over in the UK, you've got coming out this week on the 13th, Dragon Quest, Journey of the Cursed King.
4495610	4497591	If you're an RPG fan, you must get this.
4497671	4512716	PlayStation 2, Mega Man Battle Network 5, Double Team coming out on the DS, The Sims 2 expansion, Family Fun Stuff on the PC, Auto Assault also making its way to the PC, and Sega's bringing out Football Manager 2006 on the Xbox 360 and the PSP.
4512776	4515117	I believe that is the hard drive required title.
4515197	4516077	Yes, it is.
4516097	4516337	360, isn't it?
4516397	4516578	Yes.
4517278	4520819	Next week, you guys have to look forward to Final Fantasy XI on PC and Xbox.
4521159	4524402	Xbox 360, that would be the treasures of Ot Organ, of course.
4524742	4529807	Oh yes, that's right, that is coming out next week for, no, no, I'm sorry, that is the following week.
4529867	4530767	Yes, it's the following week.
4530807	4540015	Now I'm into the week of the 20th and 21st, and on the 21st you guys are getting Electroplankton over in the UK, Tamagotchi on the DS, and Tetris DS is also making its way to the DS.
4540356	4543358	Might I also say on the 20th you guys are scheduled to get 99 Nights.
4544479	4546241	Lucky, we're not getting that for a while.
4547288	4549529	I don't believe that, but we'll see.
4549549	4551029	That's what the list says.
4551089	4551809	That's what I'm reading.
4551949	4553369	So take that with a grain of salt.
4553409	4555070	Big grain of salt.
4555090	4556410	All right, well, that's what the list says.
4556430	4557470	That's just what I'm reading off of.
4558531	4559231	You know what?
4559251	4564152	It's not uncommon for folks in the UK to once in a while get a game before us, so I wouldn't completely disregard that.
4564172	4565032	Wait, who's bringing that over?
4565052	4567253	Because if that might be Ubisoft, they might be releasing it.
4567273	4568253	I closed the list.
4568653	4570053	I think it is Ubisoft.
4570173	4571234	Oh, shoot.
4572314	4572614	Whatever.
4572734	4573014	Anyways.
4574005	4575986	It's, hold on, I'm looking.
4576026	4581207	We've got, Microsoft is publishing it.
4581607	4583287	Huh, that's interesting.
4583468	4583608	Yep.
4584868	4587929	All right, now we're going to get into the final story of the night.
4590609	4592070	Oh, we have a comment in our chat room there.
4594423	4599206	BlackWolf in our chatroom says 99 Nights is coming out in Japan on April 20th, not Europe.
4599667	4601488	Yeah, I think that's more correct.
4601508	4603029	I'm reading the list.
4603109	4603849	I'm just reading the list.
4604009	4605410	I'm going with Japan.
4605510	4606371	So I made a mistake.
4607892	4609152	Loki, last story of the night.
4609713	4609973	Yes.
4611758	4614259	Well, we've seen a lot of weird things come out.
4615079	4631226	This, I don't think it actually ties in with the actual game, but if you're in Japan and you happen to be near a Japanese sex toy shop, you can find a Kingdom Hearts vibrator.
4633867	4635368	Yes, the Kingdom Hearts AC.
4636630	4639892	It's selling a Kingdom Hearts branded rabbit vibrator.
4639913	4649039	Of course, it doesn't look like it has anything to do with Kingdom Hearts, except for the name, maybe a brand name or something.
4651461	4656245	Something to get those Kingdom Hearts hardcore fans out there that they might not already own.
4656545	4658406	Now you too can join Organization 69.
4658987	4662589	I want one.
4662889	4664290	Put this on your little black hood.
4665479	4671741	This is something to get those people that have the trans vibrator and can't think of anything else gaming related to get.
4671761	4673201	This reminds me of the Hello Kitty vibrator.
4674861	4679803	I want to know how long it's going to take for fan art with Keyblades with these dangling from the end on the chain.
4680423	4680723	Really?
4681863	4685464	And Dirty Thief just got the quote of the show there in our chat room.
4685904	4688645	It's a Keyblade that unlocks your pleasure.
4690694	4691814	They win at the internet.
4692114	4695075	I think Dirty Thief ought to be marketing this show to the masses out there.
4695435	4699216	And please, if you guys do want to market the show to the masses, we really appreciate it.
4699256	4701496	That's the only way we get big is word of mouth.
4701836	4705497	We don't have no big magazine company backing our show.
4705857	4708958	We don't have no big website that backs our show.
4708998	4710318	We are independent.
4710498	4711678	We're as independent as it gets.
4711738	4716159	We are out of the spare bedroom of my apartment doing this program, and we need word of mouth.
4716539	4717940	That's right, I'm wagging my face.
4717960	4720743	The way your head is moving, I wish I could show the audience at all.
4720763	4722765	Well, we're hoping to do the video thing soon enough.
4722965	4724607	Sorry I didn't get any video this time.
4724687	4726429	Just, there wasn't anything.
4726449	4730613	Well, just check it out on olrpsp.com and huge, huge video things to come.
4730713	4731734	We're very, very excited.
4732975	4734256	And I guess that's that.
4734296	4736198	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
4736899	4738000	Your final thought, Spike.
4739389	4739830	Have a great week.
