1
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:26,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, April 9th, 2006, new screenshots from the revolution hit the internet, Xbox Live prepares for lots of new arcade games, and which Japanese company might be finding itself in big trouble this tax season?

2
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:33,900
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, Asian Bird Flu,

3
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,660
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't know.

4
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,221
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a really high fever or something, so she had to call in tonight.

5
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:02,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So we hope you feel better soon, DarkSakura, if you're out there listening.

6
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:12,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Secretly, though, I think she's just like... You know how when a really popular video game would come out, you'd stay at home, call in sick, and play hooky to play that game?

7
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:14,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Kingdom Hearts 2 did that to her.

8
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:16,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she called in sick to stay home and play Kingdom Hearts 2.

9
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:18,226
[SPEAKER_04]: No, of course I'm teasing.

10
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

11
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:24,268
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny is I feel like I'm actually Jamie right now because...

12
00:01:25,473 --> 00:01:28,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting in a chair with a laptop.

13
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:30,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, because you got your new laptop, didn't you?

14
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:31,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so this is weird.

15
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:33,556
[SPEAKER_04]: And you did not buy a Mac.

16
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:34,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not buy a Mac.

17
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:37,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the advice of our listeners.

18
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:45,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, you've got to compare the specs, and then you see clearly that the way to go is the way I did.

19
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:46,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm not a fan of Gateway.

20
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:47,562
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that feel?

21
00:01:48,102 --> 00:01:49,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fan of Gateway either, to be honest.

22
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:50,803
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

23
00:01:50,883 --> 00:01:53,444
[SPEAKER_02]: This computer is at the right price and has the right specs.

24
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,361
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, Gateway is merely the case it's in.

25
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:57,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whatever.

26
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:05,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, helping us out tonight, since we're one person short, we had to call on someone at the last minute and always prepared to lend a hand.

27
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:06,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Spike.

28
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:08,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

29
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:09,392
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

30
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:11,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing very good.

31
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:11,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

32
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:12,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to hear it.

33
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:21,784
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, he's feeling a little pressure a little bit because we literally asked him about an hour ago, hey, can you sit in and be a host tonight on a radio program on the internet?

34
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:23,045
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've done this before.

35
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:23,665
[SPEAKER_04]: You were here before.

36
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:24,765
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always good times.

37
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:26,366
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, yeah, you know a lot about games.

38
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:29,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you don't really lead it on very much, but you know a lot about games.

39
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:29,807
[SPEAKER_04]: You really do.

40
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:34,288
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that Japanese game you're saying you're going to bring me next week that was some PS2 launch title?

41
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:36,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Primal Image It's like, you know...

42
00:02:59,442 --> 00:02:59,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

43
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:03,885
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the best feature of the game because the game itself is very slow and boring.

44
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:06,066
[SPEAKER_01]: But you said it reminded you of this game.

45
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:07,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.

46
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:12,550
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically Pokemon Snap with half-naked virtual models.

47
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:18,794
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go around doing their various poses as you circle around them taking photos.

48
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:23,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get bonus points for the sort of more suggestive photos you take.

49
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:25,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Very fun.

50
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:26,919
[SPEAKER_01]: But they did not release this game in the U.S.? ?

51
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,811
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mischief Makers

52
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:56,087
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I never played that.

53
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:58,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you've got Dropjaw.

54
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,251
[SPEAKER_04]: What is Mischief Makers?

55
00:03:59,291 --> 00:03:59,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard of this.

56
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:02,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of Mischief Makers.

57
00:04:02,614 --> 00:04:03,816
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as bad as it sounds.

58
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:04,436
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

59
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:05,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me.

60
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:06,619
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this game?

61
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,159
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing it?

62
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,504
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember correctly, it's based off an anime, I want to say.

63
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:12,845
[SPEAKER_01]: No, don't look like that.

64
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,167
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like that.

65
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,249
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good game.

66
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:17,450
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an anime game.

67
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:18,211
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

68
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:28,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to go around and start this show off as we usually do with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week, where we go around and check in and see what we've been playing this week and what we like and what we hate.

69
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:30,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what have you been playing this week?

70
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:36,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing Far Cry Instinct's Predator, and that game's pretty, I don't know, long.

71
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:48,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun game, you know, but then again, it's one of those games, like achievement-wise, if you're going for achievement points in this game, you might as well spend your time elsewhere because to beat the game, you get 10 points.

72
00:04:49,437 --> 00:04:58,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to beat it in every single difficulty through both the Instinct storyline and the Evolution storyline.

73
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And then do a bunch of other shit.

74
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:07,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Where some of those Xbox Live Arcade games are like, You press the L trigger, you get 20 points!

75
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:12,282
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be hilarious to have a game with a thousand achievements and each one's a point.

76
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:15,462
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like pushing direction up, pushing direction down.

77
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,563
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be hilarious, but no, unfortunately...

78
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:19,843
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

79
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, so that game's kind of fun.

80
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:42,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get Rumble Roses XX.

81
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:45,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not buy Rumble Roses XX, just to make that clear.

82
00:05:45,732 --> 00:05:47,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not spend money on that game, unfortunately.

83
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,993
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did get it.

84
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:55,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played it, though, yet, because I got a laptop and haven't had a chance to waste time on that game.

85
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:58,196
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looked interesting, I guess.

86
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:05,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I've gotten pretty much every game for March, except for...

87
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:08,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Blazing Angels, and that's the only one I don't have yet.

88
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:13,558
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not really going to be buying games until June now, because I don't like Tomb Raider.

89
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really care for Top Spin.

90
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Battlefield 2, never played it, don't really care.

91
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:30,442
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stuff in May, you know, X-Men 3, maybe Time Shift, and MotoGP 2006 moved, and Rockstar's Table Tennis, no thank you.

92
00:06:31,582 --> 00:06:35,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admit, my interest has somewhat peaked at Rockstar Table Tennis, I must say.

93
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:38,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing, of course, more Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City Stories.

94
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just fun.

95
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:43,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Six months, I mean, now it doesn't get old.

96
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:44,837
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really fun.

97
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:49,620
[SPEAKER_02]: The multiplayer is the best part, and I hope the god that has the multiplayer when it comes out on the PlayStation 2 version.

98
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Instincts tell me, though, no.

99
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:53,482
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not gonna.

100
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:54,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

101
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:55,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?

102
00:06:56,444 --> 00:06:56,784
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

103
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:57,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

104
00:06:57,965 --> 00:07:00,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Spike, my friend, what have you been playing this week?

105
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:04,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XII, XI, oh my god.

106
00:07:06,414 --> 00:07:08,595
[SPEAKER_04]: You're too eager for the XII, aren't you?

107
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:09,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.

108
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:11,037
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to play it so badly.

109
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:19,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a marked change from how I felt initially, but now all my time with XI has me really excited about that same base gameplay, but with a story.

110
00:07:19,402 --> 00:07:19,782
[SPEAKER_01]: See?

111
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:21,002
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm telling people.

112
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:25,625
[SPEAKER_04]: To really appreciate the Final Fantasy XII demo, you must have had some exposure to XI.

113
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:26,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's true.

114
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:27,786
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely agree with you now.

115
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:32,689
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also replaying Kingdom Hearts, the first game, to get ready for the second one.

116
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:33,870
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

117
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this because you're poor and you'll have to wait until it's a $20 game?

118
00:07:37,946 --> 00:07:39,608
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost exactly why.

119
00:07:40,388 --> 00:07:41,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just giving you a hard time.

120
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,013
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I put in 17 hours over that last week.

121
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:46,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang.

122
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:54,979
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forgot how much I hated the camera, but I really like everything else about the game.

123
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:58,002
[SPEAKER_01]: That perfectly sums up my review of Kingdom Hearts, the first one.

124
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:00,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Hate the camera, love everything else.

125
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:00,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

126
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:03,006
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's my week in gaming.

127
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:03,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

128
00:08:04,287 --> 00:08:05,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what I've been playing this week.

129
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:14,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I just picked up Top Spin 2, the tennis game on the Xbox 360, which was the only Xbox 360 game I played at last year's E3.

130
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:19,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it has somewhat sentimental value to me because it was the only game that had no lines last year at E3.

131
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:24,558
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I actually played it, instead of playing it at the Microsoft booth, I played it at 2K Games' booth.

132
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:46,018
[SPEAKER_04]: and there wasn't nearly as many people there because they were kind of in a different spot so I got to play Top Spin 2 and I don't think I've played this game thoroughly enough to give it a good review yet I did notice like my first impressions were character creation whoa like okay it's it's right up there with Oblivion okay you know how Oblivion like will let you totally customize everything

133
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:47,647
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

134
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,000
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly did they do with that?

135
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,361
[SPEAKER_02]: They did the whole... There was that skit that they did on Saturday Night Live.

136
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:10,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Young Chuck Norris.

137
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:11,902
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole song that goes along with that.

138
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:16,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kicked and he punched and... It's really funny.

139
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:17,244
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta check it out.

140
00:09:17,284 --> 00:09:18,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's on YouTube.

141
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:25,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really... Just using the normal character creation, they made it really look like Chuck Norris.

142
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was hilarious because he was beating up the shop owner.

143
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:33,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It went through basically everything that was on the Saturday Night Live music video.

144
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:35,053
[SPEAKER_02]: They just kind of recreated Oblivion.

145
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:35,814
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty funny.

146
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:36,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

147
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:44,296
[SPEAKER_04]: So besides the character creation, then I started doing career mode a little bit, but I found that I kind of sucked at the game because I didn't know what I was doing.

148
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:48,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think the game had a very friendly tutorial mode or anything.

149
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:55,299
[SPEAKER_04]: There was really nothing to tell me, press A to do a light bounce, press X to do a slice, and all that stuff.

150
00:09:55,619 --> 00:10:00,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like a tennis game that's built for the retarded tennis player like myself.

151
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:04,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is too fat to play real tennis.

152
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Who might be able to benefit from knowing what a slice really is.

153
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Assuming maybe I haven't played tennis before.

154
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:12,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I know what it is.

155
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:13,241
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what I mean?

156
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:16,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have liked something that really started me from an amateur level.

157
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:20,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the game kind of threw me right in there and expected me to know stuff.

158
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:23,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Even in the first training, it's like, okay, I've got to serve 10 balls.

159
00:10:23,944 --> 00:10:25,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, okay, what the hell am I doing?

160
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:27,565
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't really explain it for me.

161
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:30,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually had to open the instruction manual and read it.

162
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:31,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like having to do that with games.

163
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:35,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Instruction manuals are dated things.

164
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:37,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't ever read instruction manuals with games.

165
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:37,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever.

166
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:38,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need them.

167
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:39,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually.

168
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,796
[SPEAKER_04]: But I needed it for this.

169
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:41,997
[SPEAKER_04]: That made me a little sad.

170
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:43,859
[SPEAKER_04]: But the graphics are really pretty.

171
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:50,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a tournament in a Japanese cup or something and it was all decorated very Japanese style.

172
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:52,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally stereotypical, but it was cool.

173
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:53,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

174
00:10:55,302 --> 00:11:09,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides that, I've been playing holdovers from last week, Beatmania, Kingdom Hearts 2, and I downloaded Feeding Frenzy, which is an Xbox Live Arcade title, which I guess came out a couple weeks ago, because I wanted a new arcade game, and Street Fighter 2 is still not available.

175
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:11,094
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell's with that?

176
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:11,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

177
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:17,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they had major lag problems that they had to fix.

178
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:21,922
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of a friend mentioned that there's major lag issues going on, and that's, I don't think...

179
00:11:22,645 --> 00:11:24,226
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

180
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:49,504
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

181
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:16,293
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's because Geometry Wars, and I really suck at Geometry Wars, but it has me skilled enough to dodge things really well using the analog stick, like using my sprite to dodge things.

182
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:21,294
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty much all Feeding Frenzy is, is a poor man's Geometry Wars with no shooter.

183
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,896
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just, here's the thing I don't like about some of these Xbox Live Arcade games.

184
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:27,836
[SPEAKER_04]: How about no trackball?

185
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:30,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that game is way better with a trackball than it is a controller.

186
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:33,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mind the controller, because I'm...

187
00:12:33,891 --> 00:12:34,612
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's okay.

188
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:38,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like the fact that it saves your progress, because the game is kind of crappy.

189
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:40,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't want to have to go back and replay the whole game.

190
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:48,612
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing, though, I don't like about it is that all these web games are getting ported over.

191
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:49,954
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just Flash games.

192
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:50,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

193
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:55,913
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me take a moment to introduce the chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.

194
00:12:56,533 --> 00:13:00,574
[SPEAKER_04]: We do tape live every Sunday night to provide listener interaction.

195
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,575
[SPEAKER_04]: We're one of the few podcasts that allow this.

196
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:03,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

197
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:03,795
[SPEAKER_04]: We love doing this.

198
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:06,016
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys get your input.

199
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:12,938
[SPEAKER_04]: GK128 says in the chat room, Feeding Frenzy, free on the PC, $10 on Xbox Live Arcade.

200
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:13,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

201
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:14,799
[SPEAKER_04]: You're absolutely right.

202
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:15,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a consumer whore.

203
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:19,881
[SPEAKER_04]: There's absolutely no reason I should have paid for this except for...

204
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:33,225
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that as opposed to sitting in my little office chair and playing on the PC little screen, I like being able to plop my butt on the couch, you know, have my cup of tea or whatever I'm drinking that night, and play on the HDTV.

205
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,046
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something to be said about that.

206
00:13:35,126 --> 00:13:40,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's why I plan to get Final Fantasy XI in a couple weeks, which makes absolutely no sense because I already have it on the PC.

207
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:48,311
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just that lazy where I want to plop on the couch and not have to move or anything and lay down and, you know, all that stuff.

208
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:48,871
Just...

209
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:52,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you buy a USB mouse and keyboard.

210
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Duh.

211
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, X defers upgrading, so I think I'm going to steal that one and use it as the Xbox thingy.

212
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:01,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm just saying, though, make sure.

213
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:13,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, there's no way in hell I would play, and I would advise anybody out there that's going to get into Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360, do yourself a favor, buy a USB keyboard and a USB mouse, because you will be a sad, sad person otherwise.

214
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:15,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you might be able to fake it without the mouse.

215
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:18,314
[SPEAKER_04]: You could probably do it without the keyboard.

216
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:28,137
[SPEAKER_02]: The mouse, yeah, the mouse, because I remember I didn't really use the mouse at all during the game, so the keyboard's fine, especially with all the shortcuts and everything, so that's not a problem.

217
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:33,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, I already have a USB mouse that I use on my laptop, and it's wireless, so why not just take it and use it on the 360?

218
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:39,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And the keyboard's good anyways because you can actually use it in other games, like, for example, putting in cheat codes in Far Cry and Sinks.

219
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:41,082
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it a lot easier with a keyboard.

220
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:42,443
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, there you go.

221
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:48,939
[SPEAKER_04]: VXJasonXV says Street Fighter 2 is now on GameTap Magic Sword is now on GameTap Hello, like one of my favorite Capcom games ever

222
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:58,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Any word on Black Tiger?

223
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:19,713
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but VXJasonXV stays on top of that stuff more than I do, so he will probably be able to stay.

224
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,833
[SPEAKER_04]: He did tell me King's Quest is on the way, though.

225
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:28,395
[SPEAKER_04]: He saw in some movie thing on GameTap TV that King's Quest is coming, to which I said something about, oh, it's about time.

226
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:31,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, other questions.

227
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:39,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed our chat room is playing Mario Kart DS tonight, so if you're trying to find friends for DS and you're listening live, go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com and click on chat.

228
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:43,965
[SPEAKER_04]: and you can find some folks to play Mario Kart DS with.

229
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:47,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I do see a lot of agreements for Mischief Makers.

230
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,033
[SPEAKER_04]: HitStun in our chatroom says, Mischief Makers fucking owns.

231
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:52,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And I quote.

232
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:54,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody knew what you were talking about.

233
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:55,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Spirit Snare agrees.

234
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:57,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Mischief Makers was indeed awesome.

235
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,170
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because you guys have the best listeners.

236
00:15:59,390 --> 00:15:59,711
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.

237
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,591
[SPEAKER_04]: We seriously do.

238
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:01,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I love our listeners.

239
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:02,313
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so awesome.

240
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,493
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a full chat room tonight.

241
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:08,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I demanded last week that more people visit our MySpace and it worked.

242
00:16:08,897 --> 00:16:12,900
[SPEAKER_04]: We've like doubled our numbers on MySpace and people are actually leaving us comments now.

243
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,601
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

244
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:14,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you guys for doing that.

245
00:16:14,962 --> 00:16:17,884
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to visit MySpace.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

246
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:18,645
[SPEAKER_04]: All one word.

247
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:23,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Hurry before they take MySpace down because of all the, you know...

248
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:26,977
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nintendo DS is the new stalker system.

249
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:31,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Your little girl might go on PictoChat and get raped.

250
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:32,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously.

251
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:32,759
[SPEAKER_04]: The hell was that?

252
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,251
[SPEAKER_02]: That news is like two months old.

253
00:16:51,312 --> 00:17:01,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to do that, just like, you know, do a little skit or something, like doing PictoChat and says, I'm going to rape you, and then have like a picture to go with it.

254
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,021
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR TV.

255
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:03,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Just save these ideas for OLR TV.

256
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:04,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

257
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:07,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you know who steals it.

258
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:08,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

259
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:14,861
[SPEAKER_04]: But wait, I was going to say, the videos, speaking of which, you updated OLRPSP.com with videos, right?

260
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:15,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was fun.

261
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:27,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Including something that we purposefully cut out of last week's show because it didn't make the podcast because I had the giggles a little too much going into one segment, but DarkSakura had a lot to do with that.

262
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,989
[SPEAKER_04]: But you taped the whole thing and put a video of it on OLRPSP.com.

263
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:31,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was fun.

264
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,771
[SPEAKER_04]: So more videos to come in the future.

265
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:35,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, more videos to come in the future.

266
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:46,024
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't say too much yet, but... Yeah, and I'm trying to... Well, the whole video thing was kind of an experiment because the PSP itself doesn't like downloading the videos.

267
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,085
[SPEAKER_02]: It thinks it's a web page.

268
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:51,347
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of retarded when you think of it because you have to save the link as.

269
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:55,989
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got to put some different instructions on there and work at it that way.

270
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're learning now because we've got something big planned.

271
00:17:58,791 --> 00:17:58,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

272
00:17:59,171 --> 00:17:59,972
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have to say.

273
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,253
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got something big planned for like a month.

274
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:03,734
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be huge.

275
00:18:04,094 --> 00:18:04,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

276
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:04,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge.

277
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:05,955
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

278
00:18:06,658 --> 00:18:13,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into some news, and we'll start it off tonight with Loki, and I got some news over there on the Revolution.

279
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:22,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, they've actually had some screenshots of Red Steel, one of the games that's coming to the Revolution, leaked to the internet.

280
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:28,496
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually out of the new issue of Game Informer, the May issue, and you know what?

281
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:35,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting to think here that the Revolution might be as powerful as some of these other systems out there.

282
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:36,885
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

283
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:07,387
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that too, which is really neat.

284
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,427
[SPEAKER_02]: And use it also as a sword in the game.

285
00:19:10,368 --> 00:19:20,971
[SPEAKER_02]: But by the screenshot so far, I would say this looks pretty on par with even stuff like Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter, and even Rainbow Six Vegas.

286
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:22,952
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really good.

287
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:28,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really shocked, especially since they're saying that the specs aren't that great and stuff.

288
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:30,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it looks really good.

289
00:19:30,396 --> 00:19:32,398
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a great comment from our chatroom right here.

290
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:35,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Ota G says, Specs don't make a game look good.

291
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Developers make games look good.

292
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:48,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, and here's the thing too, and a lot of people, when they're looking at these, they're saying, well, you know what, just because the specs aren't as powerful, because they're not going HD, they can use that extra, you know,

293
00:19:48,893 --> 00:19:51,034
[SPEAKER_02]: and processing power to make it look even better.

294
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:56,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but Nintendo, can't you do a little HD?

295
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:57,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're doing something.

296
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:00,559
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing 480p, so that's something.

297
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:01,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that mean widescreen?

298
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,581
[SPEAKER_02]: That's progressive scan.

299
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what means progressive scan.

300
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:05,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it mean I get widescreen too?

301
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:06,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, yeah.

302
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:06,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray!

303
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:08,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something.

304
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:09,724
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

305
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:10,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

306
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:13,026
[SPEAKER_02]: They can change that later maybe.

307
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:13,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

308
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,347
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

309
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:17,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it just looks really good.

310
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good.

311
00:20:19,272 --> 00:20:19,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

312
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Spike, I saw these pictures in your live journal.

313
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:23,996
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of Red Steel?

314
00:20:24,705 --> 00:20:25,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really impressed.

315
00:20:25,865 --> 00:20:30,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I, as many others, I was really excited about the revolution for the gameplay innovation.

316
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:36,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my hopes set on maybe we'd see games eventually that looked like Resident Evil 4.

317
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:41,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already like, wow, this is past that, and I'm really impressed.

318
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really happy.

319
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:53,253
[SPEAKER_04]: The only issue I have with this, in looking at the pictures, I mean, the game looks pretty hot, don't get me wrong, and I'm really glad to see that Nintendo, you know, even if this is leaked out, I'm glad to see we're finally seeing something on the revolution.

320
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:59,999
[SPEAKER_04]: My only hesitation is that I think a gun game using that controller is like the most cliche thing you could possibly do.

321
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:01,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I agree with you.

322
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,202
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a game being produced by Ubisoft.

323
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:07,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, first off, you know, that's kind of expected, I'd think, from them.

324
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:14,311
[SPEAKER_01]: But that says to me an even deeper message about developers are taking this very seriously.

325
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:18,714
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not just, you know, making $10 shovelware ports for the revolution.

326
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:20,696
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually coming up with ideas and...

327
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:29,375
[SPEAKER_01]: VXChaseNextV in chat says, Cliche, but it makes sense.

328
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:30,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose.

329
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:37,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I just hope that... I want to see more like the demo with the chopping the vegetables thing.

330
00:21:37,244 --> 00:21:38,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that was unique.

331
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:40,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you looking forward to the next Nintendogs?

332
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:47,355
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's like the DS one, I really hope they expand on it big time.

333
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:48,858
[SPEAKER_02]: They announced 50 launch titles.

334
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,020
[SPEAKER_02]: For real?

335
00:21:50,661 --> 00:21:53,927
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 launch titles, 20 of which are going to be put out by Nintendo.

336
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:56,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you get this?

337
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard of this.

338
00:21:58,281 --> 00:21:59,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember where I read that.

339
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:03,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then I have to take it with a grain of salt if you cannot cite a fact.

340
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:04,206
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're saying, though.

341
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:07,229
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that's the case, though, you will see these innovative things.

342
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:18,578
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, though, the thing about the revolution is, and they're trying to get away from the Nintendo being looked at as a kid system, a system that's meant for little kids, and that's it.

343
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:23,842
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what Microsoft and Sony want you to believe, is that the system is meant for

344
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:31,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, something tells me this little game with the gun thing is going to dispel that pretty quick.

345
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:35,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know, but it just looks good.

346
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:37,956
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I've got to say.

347
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:47,684
[SPEAKER_04]: A Nintendo fanboy's answer to whenever a Microsoft or Sony fanboy presents them with that is Resident Evil 4, which usually is a GameCube fanboy's answer to everything.

348
00:22:47,904 --> 00:22:50,226
[SPEAKER_04]: When somebody tries to doggone... Resident Evil 4, bitch.

349
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:51,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Resident Evil 4.

350
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:53,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Resident Evil 4, bitch.

351
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:54,032
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

352
00:22:54,532 --> 00:22:56,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said that exactly, actually.

353
00:22:56,132 --> 00:22:56,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you really?

354
00:22:56,933 --> 00:22:57,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I have.

355
00:22:58,133 --> 00:22:59,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody should use that in a sentence today.

356
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:03,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Challenge yourself to tell a friend, Resident Evil 4, bitch.

357
00:23:05,095 --> 00:23:05,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Snakes on a plane.

358
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:07,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

359
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:10,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Snake's on a Resident Evil 4...

360
00:23:39,388 --> 00:23:43,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Brain Age, Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day, which I'm really looking forward to trying out.

361
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:47,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it does have Sudoku in it, which I'm a little tired of, I think the rest of it will be pretty cool.

362
00:23:48,114 --> 00:23:49,254
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really looking forward to that.

363
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,315
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to try this demo.

364
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And True Swing Golf is also another demo in there.

365
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:59,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I did a quick search in our area, and it looks like GameCrazy is the chain that's going to be carrying this a lot.

366
00:23:59,161 --> 00:24:01,362
[SPEAKER_04]: GameCrazy is the one that's in Hollywood Video, right?

367
00:24:02,493 --> 00:24:03,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Some Hollywood videos.

368
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:05,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Some Hollywood videos have them, but not all.

369
00:24:05,814 --> 00:24:09,375
[SPEAKER_04]: But the one nearest me has one, and they have a download station, supposedly.

370
00:24:09,995 --> 00:24:12,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Best Buys are also going to be a huge chain that has them.

371
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:14,296
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, that's just in my area.

372
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:15,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows where they are near you?

373
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:21,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Head on over to Nintendo.com slash DSDownloadStation, all one word, to locate...

374
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:42,554
[SPEAKER_04]: A DS download station near you And all you gotta do, you go into download play And they'll all come up right on there And you choose what you want to download And here's my tip, I learned this at E3 When they did something similar All you have to do, close your DS, put it in sleep mode You can take the DS home with you as long as you don't turn it off Demo's still there I did that with the Polarium demo last year for E3 Jesus, why?

375
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:51,581
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was awful Sorry I liked it enough to buy it after the demo The only game I think I hated more than that Was Sprung

376
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I thought Polarium was a waste of my time.

377
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:56,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, now, what about Ping Pals?

378
00:24:57,203 --> 00:24:59,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's not even a game.

379
00:24:59,925 --> 00:25:01,707
[SPEAKER_04]: That just burns in hell.

380
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:02,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta love that.

381
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:05,690
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta wonder if they were developing that game before.

382
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

383
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:08,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was before PictoChat was announced.

384
00:25:08,572 --> 00:25:12,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when PictoChat was announced to be included, they were like, ah, fuck.

385
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why it's a bargain bin title now.

386
00:25:18,877 --> 00:25:20,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, you could probably find that game for like $5.

387
00:25:21,238 --> 00:25:22,258
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even worth that.

388
00:25:22,578 --> 00:25:22,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe $0.99.

389
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:30,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you can find that game at $0.99 clearance center or the $0.98 store or whatever, then maybe it might be worth a look.

390
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:32,880
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, that game is of the suck.

391
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,240
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Dollar Tree special.

392
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of the DS, when do the pretty new ones come out, Loki?

393
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:39,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully soon.

394
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:47,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And the estimated date is going to be around the same time that, you know, Mario, or the new Super Mario Brothers is coming out.

395
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:52,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, according to the latest issue of EGM, they're reporting May.

396
00:25:53,032 --> 00:25:54,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we reported May a while back too.

397
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:58,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what the source was from, but it looks like it's going to be May.

398
00:25:59,138 --> 00:26:01,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it makes sense.

399
00:26:01,421 --> 00:26:05,945
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right when this brand new game comes in and it would be a really good pack-in game.

400
00:26:06,907 --> 00:26:10,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think that's when it's going to happen, sometime mid-May.

401
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:10,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

402
00:26:11,343 --> 00:26:12,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't we kind of talk about that last week?

403
00:26:12,943 --> 00:26:19,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, theories were around on the internet saying that it's possible that the DS Lite... Well, first Mario Bros.

404
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:22,305
[SPEAKER_04]: was pushed back, but then I read that that was actually wrong.

405
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:23,005
[SPEAKER_02]: It got pushed back up.

406
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:23,646
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a week.

407
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:26,026
[SPEAKER_04]: They were kind of like... They've been volleying back and forth.

408
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:26,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

409
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:27,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a game of Top Spin.

410
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:28,847
[SPEAKER_04]: With the dates.

411
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,867
[SPEAKER_04]: But now it's back to the 15th.

412
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:31,787
[SPEAKER_04]: It's back to the 15th.

413
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:34,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So we totally reported a false story last week.

414
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:34,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Our bad.

415
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:40,229
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's back now, and maybe for the DS Lite to come out at the same time.

416
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:40,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

417
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,031
[SPEAKER_04]: They would have to announce that pretty soon.

418
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:44,633
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have to be a big surprise thing at E3.

419
00:26:45,074 --> 00:26:48,176
[SPEAKER_04]: The DS Lite is coming out, and it's on store shelves right now.

420
00:26:49,397 --> 00:26:49,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that feasible?

421
00:26:49,998 --> 00:26:50,438
[SPEAKER_04]: They could do that?

422
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:52,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull a Sega Saturn?

423
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,240
[SPEAKER_02]: They could.

424
00:26:55,402 --> 00:26:55,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think.

425
00:26:56,403 --> 00:26:59,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would actually be the Monday-Tuesday after E3.

426
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:01,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.

427
00:27:01,668 --> 00:27:01,988
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

428
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:08,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, I've got a story for you guys in regards to Mario as well.

429
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:14,274
[SPEAKER_04]: There's new postage stamps coming out in Japan that feature the Mario Bros.

430
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:14,715
[SPEAKER_04]: sprites.

431
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:19,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's 80 yen to get a 10 stamp sheet.

432
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:19,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

433
00:27:19,992 --> 00:27:22,273
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's 80 yen is the value of the stamps.

434
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:26,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's 10 of them, so it would be 800 yen to get one of these sheets.

435
00:27:26,535 --> 00:27:34,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're stamps, and they have things like the Cheep Cheeps, Mario, a Koopa, and then that horrible, horrible sprite of the princess.

436
00:27:35,977 --> 00:27:39,298
[SPEAKER_04]: It always looked to me like the princess had a buck tooth in that sprite.

437
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:40,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's just me, but that's always the way I saw it.

438
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:44,060
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked like she had funky teeth, like she was Princess White Trash.

439
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

440
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:47,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Check that out if you're in Japan.

441
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:52,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you're not in Japan, check out eBay because I'm sure a lot of these are going to show up for collectors that want to get this stuff.

442
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:54,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario Bros.

443
00:27:54,804 --> 00:27:55,264
[SPEAKER_04]: stamps.

444
00:27:56,765 --> 00:28:02,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Also in Revolution news, Zookeeper is going to be coming out for the Revolution.

445
00:28:02,068 --> 00:28:02,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

446
00:28:02,729 --> 00:28:06,331
[SPEAKER_04]: This was from an interview in Nintendo Power, I believe is where this is from.

447
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:08,152
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX 360

448
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:43,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot fathom that they would release this game as a $39, $49 title.

449
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:49,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And without some really freaking incredible bells and whistles, this game is not worth it.

450
00:28:49,392 --> 00:28:54,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'd rather see, you know, I'd rather see real animals falling down, not these, like, you know, tiles.

451
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:57,575
[SPEAKER_04]: As a DS launch title, it was okay.

452
00:28:57,895 --> 00:29:01,517
[SPEAKER_04]: But for a Revolution title... It wasn't even a launch title, and it wasn't a very good title.

453
00:29:01,557 --> 00:29:02,377
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be poopy.

454
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:04,538
[SPEAKER_04]: However, this is what this makes me think.

455
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:08,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Revolution is going to have a service very similar to Xbox Live Arcade.

456
00:29:08,942 --> 00:29:09,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.

457
00:29:09,702 --> 00:29:11,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's going to have a service just like that.

458
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:18,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think this kind of just confirms that, and I bet you these old classic titles are probably fitting into that same scheme.

459
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:24,954
[SPEAKER_04]: So not only are you going to be able to download classic titles, but probably these other games as well, all on the Revolution.

460
00:29:25,094 --> 00:29:31,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't cite you a specific source, but I'm pretty sure Iwata said something like that at a Game Developers Conference.

461
00:29:31,098 --> 00:29:31,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, probably.

462
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he said something about like,

463
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:39,011
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to make titles that are going to be distributed via the virtual conference.

464
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:42,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I thought I dreamt up this little theory all by myself.

465
00:29:42,954 --> 00:29:43,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

466
00:29:43,975 --> 00:29:44,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

467
00:29:44,635 --> 00:29:45,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Rain on my parade.

468
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:45,776
[SPEAKER_04]: See if I care.

469
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:51,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, Zookeeper's coming to both those systems, and we do not care here at Orange Launch Radio.

470
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:54,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I'm so glad we gave you this story tonight.

471
00:29:56,303 --> 00:29:59,005
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something going on in the Apple world, right?

472
00:29:59,245 --> 00:29:59,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.

473
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:01,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?

474
00:30:02,193 --> 00:30:11,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaming, it's not really been a strong thing on the Apple and now with the Intel chips and the Intel Macs out there.

475
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:20,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, Apple, their response to gaming on the Mac is use Windows.

476
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:23,837
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, because the Mac is useless, so you have to use Windows.

477
00:30:24,237 --> 00:30:31,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so you can use this program called Boot Camp that will let you install Windows XP without moving your Mac data.

478
00:30:32,438 --> 00:30:36,219
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically what it'll do is basically a dual boot in the beginning.

479
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:40,720
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can run Windows XP and it'll run a lot of stuff on there, that's for sure.

480
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:49,622
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of games, I can't remember whether it's basically saying, but just a lot of the major games out there right now.

481
00:30:49,822 --> 00:30:54,623
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely worth checking out if you want to play some games on a Mac.

482
00:30:56,243 --> 00:30:56,583
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

483
00:30:56,603 --> 00:30:58,384
[SPEAKER_04]: You can already play World of Warcraft on a Mac.

484
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:00,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is usually... Hey, real games.

485
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:01,385
[SPEAKER_04]: But not Final Fantasy.

486
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:02,346
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't, no.

487
00:31:02,746 --> 00:31:04,026
[SPEAKER_04]: So, here's the thing.

488
00:31:04,106 --> 00:31:07,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, first off, Macs do to do something.

489
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:14,751
[SPEAKER_04]: On my iBook, I have made CDs and DVDs faster and prettier than I have on the PC and all that other stuff.

490
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:17,132
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you make a CD prettier?

491
00:31:17,332 --> 00:31:22,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Just with all the pretty stuff that Apple makes for it to pretty-fy your CDs.

492
00:31:22,874 --> 00:31:23,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done it.

493
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:24,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Like...

494
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:26,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty Sound... I don't know.

495
00:31:26,935 --> 00:31:28,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking more DVDs, okay?

496
00:31:28,276 --> 00:31:31,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Like pretty menus and pretty things that I just could not do on the PC.

497
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,521
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just too weird for me.

498
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:36,003
[SPEAKER_04]: You couldn't do or PC couldn't do.

499
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:37,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, shut up.

500
00:31:37,985 --> 00:31:38,625
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

501
00:31:38,986 --> 00:31:40,567
[SPEAKER_02]: My point is, I love my Mac.

502
00:31:40,587 --> 00:31:41,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, listen.

503
00:31:41,148 --> 00:31:42,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get mad at me.

504
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:43,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Get mad at freaking Apple.

505
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,752
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the ones saying use Windows, so...

506
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:48,428
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not stupid.

507
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,128
[SPEAKER_04]: That's smart.

508
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:53,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Because now people are going to go, you mean I could do both on one system?

509
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,530
[SPEAKER_02]: That's smart.

510
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

511
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:01,353
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get a computer that's pretty, then that way you can run Windows and do stuff on Windows.

512
00:32:01,773 --> 00:32:04,274
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that not the perfect solution?

513
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:07,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty and it does everything you need to do.

514
00:32:08,275 --> 00:32:10,196
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's just like,

515
00:32:11,547 --> 00:32:12,968
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just stupid, okay.

516
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:14,328
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever, okay.

517
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:26,995
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're really confident that Mac OS X or whatever is great for, you know, doing your video and audio or whatever, and to be honest, it's only better for print media, okay, then great.

518
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:31,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Use your Mac OS X for that and then use Windows for everything else.

519
00:32:31,758 --> 00:32:36,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, I'll use Windows for everything because, well, it can do everything that Mac OS X can.

520
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,401
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there.

521
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:40,062
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a jerk.

522
00:32:41,949 --> 00:32:45,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to another story and this is interesting.

523
00:32:45,752 --> 00:32:47,834
[SPEAKER_04]: We always love gaming and politics stories.

524
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:55,320
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a conservative political website out there that was actually defending gaming this week which I thought was very interesting.

525
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,265
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nationalreview.com is the name of the site and they make some very interesting bullet points here.

526
00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:01,606
[SPEAKER_04]: He kind of

527
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:06,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Adam Therer Of all the games that were reviewed by the ESRB in 2005, less than 13% were rated mature or adults only.

528
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:08,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Over 80% were either E or T.

529
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:28,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Every important social indicator has been improving in recent years even as video game use among youths have increased.

530
00:33:28,737 --> 00:33:33,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Aggregate violent crime by juveniles fell 43% between 1995 and 2004.

531
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:40,505
[SPEAKER_04]: A quick glance at the back of any game box provides parents with plenty of information to make decisions for their families.

532
00:33:40,845 --> 00:33:48,770
[SPEAKER_04]: with most new video games costing between $40 and $60, it's likely that adults will need to be present when their kids purchase games.

533
00:33:49,050 --> 00:34:03,819
[SPEAKER_04]: So, kind of interesting there, coming from a conservative blog, which, I don't know, kind of is trying to set the stage that makes it look like liberals are for these gaming restrictions and conservatives are against them, but I don't really believe that because I've

534
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:10,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Traditionally vote usually liberal, not 100% of the time, but usually liberal, and I certainly don't support it.

535
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:33,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a lack of education on most politicians, and let's not forget, in order for these laws to pass most of the time in the states and everything, it's got to have bipartisan support, because usually you don't pass with just one side of the house, but that's just my... You've got to wonder how many of these actual lawmakers out there are just bored out of their mind, and they just want to go home, so they're going to agree to whatever you put in front of them.

536
00:34:33,356 --> 00:34:33,716
[SPEAKER_04]: No idea.

537
00:34:34,997 --> 00:34:37,899
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's kind of... It's like, another one of these bills?

538
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:39,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine!

539
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do it.

540
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go home.

541
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:42,441
[SPEAKER_02]: And screw a hooker.

542
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,463
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what politicians do.

543
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:55,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, speaking of M-rated games in which you might be screwing hookers, Loki, there's some interesting statistics out there this week on M-rated games?

544
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:58,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because Harvard, you know, because they have nothing better to do than...

545
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

546
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:25,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the report's conclusion was parents and physicians should recognize that the popular M-rated video games contain a wide range of unlabeled content.

547
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:37,259
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually, I think most of the content is labeled on the back there in that little label that says M and may expose children and adolescents to messages that may negatively influence their perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors.

548
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:39,199
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

549
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:43,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it clearly says, you know, rated M for violence.

550
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,240
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't say rated M for

551
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:48,228
[SPEAKER_02]: 104 violent deaths per minute or hour or whatever.

552
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:54,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are they wasting our money on doing studies like this?

553
00:35:55,181 --> 00:35:58,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, I could look at a game and go, hmm, that's pretty violent.

554
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:04,488
[SPEAKER_02]: When the game's called I'm Gonna Kill Your Fucking Mother, you probably can guess, hmm, it's pretty violent.

555
00:36:04,508 --> 00:36:10,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of Happy Puppy Fun Time is not going to have freaking violent deaths in it.

556
00:36:11,093 --> 00:36:13,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, what's the big deal?

557
00:36:13,075 --> 00:36:14,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are they doing studies on this?

558
00:36:15,076 --> 00:36:18,859
[SPEAKER_02]: R-rated movies are bad, okay, because they have R-rated content.

559
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:22,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, M-rated games are going to have bad content in them as well.

560
00:36:22,392 --> 00:36:24,413
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes perfect sense.

561
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:25,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my thought is only 104?

562
00:36:26,555 --> 00:36:27,596
[SPEAKER_04]: That's child's play.

563
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:28,516
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a low score.

564
00:36:29,097 --> 00:36:30,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't you ever played Smash TV?

565
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:35,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know how many violent deaths occur in the scope of like two minutes when I'm playing Smash TV?

566
00:36:37,724 --> 00:36:40,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you tear through just people among people.

567
00:36:40,726 --> 00:36:44,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen games like Dynasty Warriors and 99 Nights and stuff like that?

568
00:36:44,149 --> 00:36:47,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, you're killing thousands of people in like minutes.

569
00:36:48,317 --> 00:36:50,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to know what games were sampled.

570
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:53,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know, and I don't really care.

571
00:36:53,718 --> 00:37:06,261
[SPEAKER_04]: All I know is... And did they, like, were you playing a game like, I don't know, like, I hate to use this as an example, but Driver 3, where, like, when I play, I aim for the people, and that's how I play Driver 3, is I purposely try to run over as many people as I can.

572
00:37:06,281 --> 00:37:10,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Shouldn't you be, like, trying to find a cure for cancer or something, other than doing, you know, stupid research like this?

573
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:12,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what's this actually prove?

574
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:13,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, we knew what we already knew.

575
00:37:14,843 --> 00:37:15,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

576
00:37:15,464 --> 00:37:17,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me my A. You know, seriously.

577
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:18,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

578
00:37:19,647 --> 00:37:20,127
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

579
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:24,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going over to the chat room, www.orangelongeradio.com.

580
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:25,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Click on chat.

581
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is very funny.

582
00:37:26,951 --> 00:37:33,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya was responding to the whole like all the information is on the back of the box thing from the conservative blog.

583
00:37:33,934 --> 00:37:37,396
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says, yeah, but parents would actually have to check the back of the box.

584
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:38,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

585
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:40,938
[SPEAKER_02]: All the effort to rotate the box.

586
00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:43,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Why was I even thinking that?

587
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Because parents don't have that kind of energy.

588
00:37:46,844 --> 00:37:49,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Let alone to watch kids and monitor what they do.

589
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:50,969
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I think is great.

590
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:53,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I tell a story about my childhood and my mother from my childhood?

591
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:55,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

592
00:37:55,695 --> 00:38:02,984
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was a kid, my mom would spend literally an hour at the video store reading the back of every single box of every movie that's new that week.

593
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,685
[SPEAKER_04]: She's in the store.

594
00:38:03,705 --> 00:38:03,945
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going,

595
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:05,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I want to rant this one?

596
00:38:06,695 --> 00:38:07,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do I want to rant that?

597
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:08,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this one sounds violent.

598
00:38:08,796 --> 00:38:09,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I want to get that one.

599
00:38:10,137 --> 00:38:13,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this might be, you know, she'll spend like an hour reading the back of every box.

600
00:38:13,898 --> 00:38:16,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like I'll, you know, take a game that I want to rant.

601
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll walk up to her and I'll be all, can I rant this?

602
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:20,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And she'll ask me, what's it about?

603
00:38:20,121 --> 00:38:22,763
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about fun.

604
00:38:24,143 --> 00:38:25,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy puppies.

605
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:28,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, can I rant Mortal Kombat 2?

606
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:29,706
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it about?

607
00:38:31,147 --> 00:38:32,907
[SPEAKER_04]: People playing together.

608
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:33,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

609
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:44,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean seriously, yet in the same scope, I mean I love my mom, in the same scope she would spend like an hour reading the back of all the movie boxes and you know, she'd have to ask me what the game's about.

610
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:52,567
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I was thinking like games like Smash TV, how many people do you think you kill in that game, you know, in an average minute?

611
00:38:53,268 --> 00:38:53,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably about 104.

612
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:56,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd go more like 300.

613
00:38:57,309 --> 00:38:59,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you playing two-player or one-player?

614
00:38:59,931 --> 00:39:00,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it depends.

615
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:06,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And somebody in the chatroom, Dark Knight, mentioned the sequel, Total Carnage, which is probably twice as bad.

616
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:08,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, and here's another thing, too.

617
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:17,560
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're counting violent deaths, say I'm playing a Star Wars game or something like that, and I destroy the Death Star or something.

618
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,901
[SPEAKER_02]: How many millions of people are in the Death Star?

619
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:23,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's really going to throw the statistic out.

620
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:27,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Out there, so I don't know.

621
00:39:27,884 --> 00:39:30,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the AT-ST count for 30 deaths?

622
00:39:30,685 --> 00:39:31,886
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good question.

623
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:33,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And it should if it doesn't.

624
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:35,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm so glad to know I'm not alone.

625
00:39:35,187 --> 00:39:39,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireboma in our chatroom says that's the exact same thing my parents did, Sky.

626
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,769
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not alone in the world.

627
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:42,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to know.

628
00:39:45,611 --> 00:39:46,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

629
00:39:47,779 --> 00:39:49,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a friendly warning to folks out there.

630
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,640
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a story.

631
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Another study.

632
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:55,862
[SPEAKER_04]: This was according to Reuters actually ran this study here.

633
00:39:56,523 --> 00:39:58,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they conducted the study, but they actually ran it.

634
00:39:58,884 --> 00:40:04,046
[SPEAKER_04]: But they just want you to know, mature rated video games may contain mature content.

635
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you?

636
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:07,282
[SPEAKER_04]: No, here's the deal.

637
00:40:07,362 --> 00:40:08,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Pornos may contain sex.

638
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:09,464
[SPEAKER_04]: No, here's the deal.

639
00:40:09,964 --> 00:40:19,172
[SPEAKER_04]: The study shows that a big black M on the front of the game may not be enough to show that there's violence, nudity, or whatever else is in the game.

640
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:24,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it doesn't go into as much details as you might have thought.

641
00:40:24,896 --> 00:40:26,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Kimberly Thompson was the study's author.

642
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:32,823
[SPEAKER_04]: She's concerned that parents might take this as a sign that the game is just peachy for kids, saying that

643
00:40:33,323 --> 00:40:39,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents should not interpret the absence of a content descriptor to mean the absence of content.

644
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:48,972
[SPEAKER_04]: The study found that 80% of M-rated games included sex, violence, profanity, gambling, or drug and alcohol use, none of which was described on the labels.

645
00:40:49,312 --> 00:40:50,713
[SPEAKER_04]: This was ran by Reuters.

646
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:52,374
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Super Mario Bros.

647
00:40:52,394 --> 00:40:59,038
[SPEAKER_02]: 3 contains gambling as well because you can get your power-ups, you have to match them, and that's like a slot machine.

648
00:40:59,518 --> 00:41:01,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?

649
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't...

650
00:41:04,048 --> 00:41:05,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on, why wasn't that rated M?

651
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:08,770
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, here's another thing, too, I was wondering.

652
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:14,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should change our ranking system to NP for mature-rated games, not Peachy for kids.

653
00:41:14,373 --> 00:41:15,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that better.

654
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:17,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, what do we need to have?

655
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:22,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a person's decapitated head, you know, that says, this may contain violence.

656
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't know!

657
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:27,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't tell that the decapitated head meant violence.

658
00:41:27,312 --> 00:41:27,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know.

659
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:30,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's what we need to do is start putting little pictures on the thing.

660
00:41:30,374 --> 00:41:33,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, a little decapitated head may contain violence.

661
00:41:34,235 --> 00:41:36,797
[SPEAKER_04]: A pair of titties may contain nudity.

662
00:41:37,297 --> 00:41:40,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, just write fuck on the box, you know, might contain profanity.

663
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:41,839
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's...

664
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:46,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine what the cover of Grand Theft Auto would look like?

665
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:48,942
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm gonna say.

666
00:41:48,962 --> 00:41:53,044
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seriously, though, this is why we have to put on, like, you know, spray paint bottles.

667
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:53,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not eat.

668
00:41:53,984 --> 00:41:59,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just because people out there are that fucking retarded that they can't figure this stuff out.

669
00:41:59,986 --> 00:42:06,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, if you're that dumb, you know, that you can't understand what the words mean, maybe you shouldn't be playing games.

670
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:08,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you should learn how to read instead.

671
00:42:10,421 --> 00:42:13,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireboma would like to point out Kingdom Hearts 2 has blood in it.

672
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it should be rated M for Slash.

673
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:21,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight is suggesting some other family-friendly games that parents could buy here.

674
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:22,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary-Kate and Ashley get a clue.

675
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:26,091
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be a good one for parents to play.

676
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:27,332
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be really good.

677
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:30,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, now they're talking about Super Mario Bros.

678
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:36,878
[SPEAKER_04]: hacks, because somebody said Super Titty Bros., which I guess was really a hack that was out there, and now they're talking about all the other hacks.

679
00:42:36,978 --> 00:42:37,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Porno Bros.

680
00:42:37,799 --> 00:42:38,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Cracks out there.

681
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Lame.

682
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody and their mother did a Super Mario Bros.

683
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:42,599
[SPEAKER_04]: hack.

684
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:48,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of hacks, we have a story on our old buddy Jackie Poo, right, Loki?

685
00:42:48,383 --> 00:42:49,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Jackie Poo.

686
00:42:49,924 --> 00:42:53,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And his modest proposal, part two.

687
00:42:54,147 --> 00:43:00,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, he, I don't know what he has against Joystick and why he's reading so much of this website.

688
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:01,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they'll report on him.

689
00:43:02,552 --> 00:43:03,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, you know.

690
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:10,605
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, he says, hey, how about a video game depicting killing of people who run Joystick?

691
00:43:11,105 --> 00:43:16,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet they'd be real interested in doing something about a certain game then.

692
00:43:17,148 --> 00:43:21,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they would feel how cops and women feel about Grand Theft Auto.

693
00:43:21,649 --> 00:43:24,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but that would require some actual thought.

694
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And I forgot, you're all gamers.

695
00:43:26,311 --> 00:43:29,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So Joystick is running a contest now to design a game.

696
00:43:29,592 --> 00:43:29,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

697
00:43:30,265 --> 00:43:50,955
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff and it's to be honest it's real stupid and yes joystick I love that response joystick's response is to run a contest encouraging the deaths of joystick uh bloggers horrifically and the best one will win a prize or whatever it is I mean that's great I don't understand what this guy's problem is I mean seriously why is he going out to gaming blogs I mean that's like

698
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:54,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Because thousands of people read joystick.

699
00:43:54,564 --> 00:43:57,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I read joystick, you read joystick, Spike, you read joystick.

700
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:57,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn right.

701
00:43:57,686 --> 00:43:58,907
[SPEAKER_04]: That's three out of three right there.

702
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:01,770
[SPEAKER_04]: 100% of gamers read joystick.

703
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,431
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% of us don't care what he says either.

704
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:03,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

705
00:44:03,992 --> 00:44:08,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, doesn't he understand that that's... See, did you like how I ran that study?

706
00:44:08,976 --> 00:44:09,956
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what other people do.

707
00:44:10,097 --> 00:44:12,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I said 100% of gamers read joystick because we all do.

708
00:44:12,899 --> 00:44:13,159
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's 100%.

709
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:18,163
[SPEAKER_04]: You know... Send it to Harvard.

710
00:44:18,183 --> 00:44:19,804
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be our new tagline.

711
00:44:20,165 --> 00:44:21,646
[SPEAKER_04]: 100% of gamers listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

712
00:44:22,824 --> 00:44:23,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be great?

713
00:44:24,985 --> 00:44:34,371
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm sorry, but Jackie Poo needs to seriously, he needs to do something.

714
00:44:34,451 --> 00:44:35,332
[SPEAKER_02]: He needs to get a hobby.

715
00:44:36,052 --> 00:44:42,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And because this whole, you know, holy crusade that he's going on is just ridiculous.

716
00:44:44,197 --> 00:44:48,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's like the freaking Batman of the legal world.

717
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's,

718
00:44:49,076 --> 00:44:57,139
[SPEAKER_02]: He will not stop until he gets revenge with the people who killed people because they played Grand Theft Auto or something.

719
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,041
[SPEAKER_04]: RavensDolphin in chat says, Orange Lounge Radio is next for Jack.

720
00:45:01,121 --> 00:45:01,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Look out.

721
00:45:01,941 --> 00:45:02,421
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

722
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, here it is, right there on the table.

723
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:15,907
[SPEAKER_04]: If Jackie Poo wants to come on this show and have a professional interview, as long as he's prepared to answer the difficult questions, because we don't BS around, I will treat him with respect and dignity forever.

724
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:17,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

725
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:32,941
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

726
00:45:55,472 --> 00:45:58,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Conduct yourself like a lawyer and not like a little kid.

727
00:46:25,926 --> 00:46:26,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack's latest tirades and such.

728
00:46:26,847 --> 00:46:28,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they are wiping their ass with his name.

729
00:46:29,168 --> 00:46:29,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally.

730
00:46:29,448 --> 00:46:29,869
[SPEAKER_04]: That's mature.

731
00:46:53,875 --> 00:47:01,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, in fact, if you want to buy some Jack Thompson toilet paper, they have it available on Jinx.com.

732
00:47:01,721 --> 00:47:03,823
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only $5.95 for a roll.

733
00:47:04,604 --> 00:47:06,745
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, is it two-player or one-player?

734
00:47:07,126 --> 00:47:08,927
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot for a roll of toilet paper.

735
00:47:08,947 --> 00:47:14,011
[SPEAKER_04]: $5.95 at Target will get you like a 12-pack, at least, of toilet paper.

736
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:18,795
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a lot of ass to wipe there with the Jack Thompson toilet paper for $5.95.

737
00:47:19,075 --> 00:47:22,798
[SPEAKER_01]: But every time you use the bathroom, you'd come out smiling.

738
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:25,197
[SPEAKER_01]: That's worth something.

739
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I already do that.

740
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:26,657
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

741
00:47:26,697 --> 00:47:29,658
[SPEAKER_02]: In case if that's not enough, they also have RIAA toilet paper, too.

742
00:47:29,698 --> 00:47:30,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goody.

743
00:47:31,178 --> 00:47:32,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I get a discount if I order them both?

744
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:35,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

745
00:47:37,259 --> 00:47:41,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't condone buying this because it looks like single ply and not very comfortable.

746
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:50,462
[SPEAKER_04]: And our chat room is making all sorts of sophomoric comments that I'm not going to read out loud because it's about first grade humor level, but it is really funny.

747
00:47:50,482 --> 00:47:51,202
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're not?

748
00:47:51,522 --> 00:47:52,122
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really...

749
00:47:54,315 --> 00:47:54,695
[SPEAKER_04]: F.U.s of the Week

750
00:48:26,773 --> 00:48:28,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's time for the FUs of the week.

751
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:31,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, why don't you start us off tonight since DarkSakura is absent.

752
00:48:31,715 --> 00:48:33,155
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to whatever made Jamie sick.

753
00:48:33,976 --> 00:48:35,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and fuck you.

754
00:48:36,617 --> 00:48:44,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is typical of laptops, but my freaking crotch is on fire from this stupid laptop because this thing is so damn hot.

755
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,480
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not even funny.

756
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Could somebody please wiki quote that?

757
00:48:48,601 --> 00:48:50,382
[SPEAKER_04]: My crotch is on fire from this laptop.

758
00:48:50,402 --> 00:48:51,022
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

759
00:48:51,042 --> 00:48:51,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

760
00:48:52,534 --> 00:48:54,295
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to take me out of my page anyway.

761
00:48:54,395 --> 00:48:56,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Your wiki quote thing got queued for deletion, didn't it?

762
00:48:57,157 --> 00:48:59,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's because somebody out there is bitter.

763
00:48:59,318 --> 00:48:59,858
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not me.

764
00:49:00,058 --> 00:49:00,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do it.

765
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:01,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know it wasn't you.

766
00:49:01,919 --> 00:49:03,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Save the wiki quote page.

767
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, somebody suggested to move it to an Orange Lounge Radio wiki quote page.

768
00:49:07,102 --> 00:49:09,724
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like that idea because I want to get quoted once in a while too.

769
00:49:10,044 --> 00:49:12,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I say some pretty profound things in the show once in a while, don't I?

770
00:49:13,106 --> 00:49:13,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't I?

771
00:49:13,926 --> 00:49:14,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't I?

772
00:49:14,526 --> 00:49:14,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

773
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:15,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

774
00:49:16,648 --> 00:49:17,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Save the wiki quote.

775
00:49:17,748 --> 00:49:18,188
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway.

776
00:49:18,509 --> 00:49:18,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that...

777
00:49:19,861 --> 00:49:21,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Typical, fuck you, slow drivers.

778
00:49:21,662 --> 00:49:23,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're out there, they're out there in numbers.

779
00:49:23,764 --> 00:49:36,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like every time I'm trying to go someplace, you know, and get there in a timely manner, there's always someone that has to drive 30 miles an hour while, you know, sticking their hand out the window pretending it's like a fucking wing or something that they're flying a plane with their hand.

780
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:39,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, fucking drive instead of playing with your goddamn arm!

781
00:49:40,117 --> 00:49:41,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's it.

782
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:43,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

783
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:46,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Spike, do you have any FUs that you want to give out?

784
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:49,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are you in a good, happy, huggy, tree-hugging mood

785
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:54,203
[SPEAKER_01]: The only F view that I can really think of, it's really minor.

786
00:49:54,743 --> 00:50:01,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really bothered by the edits that Square Enix made to Kingdom Hearts 2 for a US release.

787
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:07,335
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were talking in the chatroom about it, and you know, it's not really a big deal, and that's absolutely correct.

788
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:14,282
[SPEAKER_01]: But it still seems pointless to me to change guns to not look so realistic in Kingdom Hearts.

789
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:19,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that because Kingdom Hearts they think is more of a kids game because of the Disney element?

790
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:20,273
[SPEAKER_01]: I would expect so.

791
00:50:20,653 --> 00:50:29,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I read on, I think it was Kotaku, but don't quote me on that, that it actually helped them to get a younger rating by changing the guns to look more cartoony.

792
00:50:30,999 --> 00:50:37,704
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I just, it bothers me that such a little thing could make such a big difference, you know?

793
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:45,008
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't, like, stop, you know, 187 from, you know, people killing people, but...

794
00:50:45,816 --> 00:50:45,956
[SPEAKER_01]: My F.U.

795
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:46,316
[SPEAKER_01]: goes to Konami.

796
00:51:14,093 --> 00:51:18,336
[SPEAKER_04]: and I realized that this show, if it weren't for DDR, we probably wouldn't be doing this show.

797
00:51:19,197 --> 00:51:22,039
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, Konami, fuck you this week.

798
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:22,539
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why?

799
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you are also in the business of making slot machines.

800
00:51:27,582 --> 00:51:31,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And those slot machines stole $60 from me at the casino the other night.

801
00:51:31,585 --> 00:51:37,388
[SPEAKER_04]: So F you, you makers of one-armed bandits that steal my money and don't give me any back.

802
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:41,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I could definitely go for a Suikoden slot machine.

803
00:51:41,191 --> 00:51:41,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

804
00:51:43,939 --> 00:51:45,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, how about a Rumble Roses slot machine?

805
00:51:46,331 --> 00:51:46,771
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

806
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's a future list list we need to do.

807
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:50,573
[SPEAKER_04]: A slot machine we'd like to see Konami make.

808
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Konami do the fortune cookie one?

809
00:51:52,675 --> 00:51:53,775
[SPEAKER_04]: That one is hilarious.

810
00:51:53,935 --> 00:51:56,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the most racist slot machine I've ever seen.

811
00:51:56,497 --> 00:52:07,983
[SPEAKER_04]: The fortune cookie, and you play it, and if you get all the fortune cookies, then the guy who runs the Chinese restaurant comes up and goes, This is Mr. Lucky's Chinese... I'm like, it's the most racist thing I've ever seen in my life.

812
00:52:08,403 --> 00:52:08,703
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them.

813
00:52:09,264 --> 00:52:11,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just like, is that Konami that made that?

814
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:11,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

815
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:14,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, if you win on my money, I have no money to buy rice!

816
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:16,087
[SPEAKER_04]: It's horrible.

817
00:52:16,207 --> 00:52:16,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It's horrible.

818
00:52:17,348 --> 00:52:19,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not making this up.

819
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:22,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to a casino if you're over 18, 21, whatever the age is in your state.

820
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:25,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to a casino and check out that fortune cookie machine.

821
00:52:26,033 --> 00:52:27,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually play it for a little bit.

822
00:52:27,454 --> 00:52:27,814
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bad.

823
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:31,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

824
00:52:32,337 --> 00:52:32,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

825
00:52:33,177 --> 00:52:33,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

826
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:36,379
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a sequel being made.

827
00:52:36,959 --> 00:52:37,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally.

828
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,501
[SPEAKER_04]: After many failed attempts.

829
00:52:40,261 --> 00:52:40,942
[SPEAKER_02]: A game that I love.

830
00:52:41,122 --> 00:52:41,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

831
00:52:42,142 --> 00:52:42,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Pilotwings.

832
00:52:43,442 --> 00:52:44,082
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense.

833
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:45,903
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to put one on the revolution.

834
00:52:47,304 --> 00:52:53,407
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's basically rumored according to EGM on the latest issue.

835
00:52:53,727 --> 00:52:57,729
[SPEAKER_02]: They had it in their rumor section, so it makes sense.

836
00:52:57,849 --> 00:53:03,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think so, especially with the remote, the revmote or whatever, and the way you would be able to use that in the game.

837
00:53:03,952 --> 00:53:07,474
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it would be gimmicky enough to where they would do that.

838
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:09,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

839
00:53:20,975 --> 00:53:28,401
[SPEAKER_02]: and you would have maybe a Smash Brothers and maybe Metroid and Pilotwings.

840
00:53:28,421 --> 00:53:29,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think what else.

841
00:53:29,722 --> 00:53:30,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon.

842
00:53:30,823 --> 00:53:32,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon Beatdown.

843
00:53:32,184 --> 00:53:34,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have a hard time believing that all these games are going to be out at launch.

844
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:37,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you mean by at launch, like the first six months.

845
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:39,070
[SPEAKER_04]: That I would believe.

846
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,512
[SPEAKER_04]: But 50 games, like the week the system comes out?

847
00:53:41,932 --> 00:53:42,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell no.

848
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:43,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell no.

849
00:53:44,795 --> 00:53:49,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I do think that, if anything, the first party games will be there because obviously they've been working on those the longest.

850
00:53:50,402 --> 00:53:55,905
[SPEAKER_04]: If Nintendo has 20 first party games out on launch day, I will do something crazy.

851
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:57,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me something to do.

852
00:53:57,306 --> 00:53:57,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I will do it.

853
00:53:58,187 --> 00:54:01,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me see.

854
00:54:01,209 --> 00:54:05,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if it's 20 games or 20% of the 50 games.

855
00:54:05,571 --> 00:54:07,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a little different.

856
00:54:07,212 --> 00:54:07,913
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little bit different.

857
00:54:07,933 --> 00:54:09,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're changing our story, aren't we, a little bit?

858
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:13,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the number 50, 50 games, but 20% of them.

859
00:54:14,076 --> 00:54:18,199
[SPEAKER_04]: How about $50 for 20 games that will be available in the first month?

860
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:19,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's more realistic.

861
00:54:20,686 --> 00:54:21,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

862
00:54:22,088 --> 00:54:23,010
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just see it at E3.

863
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:41,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Rub myself in $340 worth of pudding, says DJ Poo Eater.

864
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,068
[SPEAKER_04]: How about this?

865
00:54:42,388 --> 00:54:44,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I won't go for $340.

866
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:50,532
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if Nintendo puts out 20 games on the launch day, it has to be on the day, otherwise it doesn't count.

867
00:54:50,572 --> 00:54:57,316
[SPEAKER_04]: If Nintendo puts out 20 days, I will get a six-pack of those Jell-O pudding things and rub it all over myself live on air.

868
00:54:58,442 --> 00:54:59,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we take photos?

869
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:00,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, can we take photos?

870
00:55:00,823 --> 00:55:01,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

871
00:55:01,443 --> 00:55:02,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Take video.

872
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:04,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you can do a video and put it on our PSP.

873
00:55:04,805 --> 00:55:09,947
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, Nintendo has to release 20 games on the launch day, and it's not going to happen.

874
00:55:11,027 --> 00:55:12,448
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can feel comfortable saying that.

875
00:55:13,668 --> 00:55:13,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

876
00:55:16,209 --> 00:55:19,451
[SPEAKER_04]: To which our chatroom is having a little bit of a scary thought there.

877
00:55:19,471 --> 00:55:20,851
[SPEAKER_04]: What, did DarkTetsuya have a better idea?

878
00:55:22,712 --> 00:55:23,232
[SPEAKER_04]: What did he say?

879
00:55:23,272 --> 00:55:24,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you say Spike in the chatroom?

880
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:28,223
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya asks, will you go straight?

881
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:32,165
[SPEAKER_04]: If I would go straight, you know, I think the person I'm seeing will have a big problem with that.

882
00:55:32,586 --> 00:55:34,567
[SPEAKER_04]: If I went straight suddenly over a stupid bet.

883
00:55:35,388 --> 00:55:36,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he'd laugh.

884
00:55:37,529 --> 00:55:38,430
[SPEAKER_04]: 250 jello shots.

885
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:39,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll die.

886
00:55:42,332 --> 00:55:47,536
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we'll do Rob's Puddin' Adventure and put it on OLR PSP.

887
00:55:48,096 --> 00:55:49,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, it's got to be 20 games.

888
00:55:49,437 --> 00:55:49,417
19?

889
00:55:49,957 --> 00:55:51,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't work.

890
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:51,098
21?

891
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:53,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll get 7.

892
00:55:56,687 --> 00:56:01,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, wouldn't 20% of 50 be 10 anyways?

893
00:56:01,231 --> 00:56:03,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't 20% of 50 be 10 anyways?

894
00:56:04,214 --> 00:56:04,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

895
00:56:04,855 --> 00:56:05,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So how about 10 games?

896
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,301
[SPEAKER_01]: It would make for compelling radio.

897
00:56:11,442 --> 00:56:12,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

898
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:14,364
[SPEAKER_04]: See, 10 might be realistic to me.

899
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:17,107
[SPEAKER_04]: How many did they have on GameCube at launch?

900
00:56:17,348 --> 00:56:18,288
[SPEAKER_04]: They only had like 4 or 5.

901
00:56:18,429 --> 00:56:19,590
[SPEAKER_04]: On the day the system came out?

902
00:56:21,803 --> 00:56:23,104
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

903
00:56:51,414 --> 00:56:53,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 360 got a new demo this week.

904
00:56:53,836 --> 00:56:55,977
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the demo for Tomb Raider Legend.

905
00:56:56,077 --> 00:57:01,321
[SPEAKER_04]: It hit the store and was on Tuesday, April 4th is when that demo went to the store.

906
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:02,442
[SPEAKER_04]: The Marketplace.

907
00:57:03,042 --> 00:57:04,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep saying the store, but the Marketplace.

908
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually went and I downloaded it and it sucked.

909
00:57:08,286 --> 00:57:08,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like it at all.

910
00:57:09,266 --> 00:57:09,787
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty.

911
00:57:10,902 --> 00:57:11,782
[SPEAKER_04]: But not pretty enough.

912
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:15,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the framerate was not where it should be for an next-gen system.

913
00:57:16,524 --> 00:57:20,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt the gameplay feels about 10 years old, like an old Tomb Raider game.

914
00:57:21,006 --> 00:57:23,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was bored, and I didn't even finish the demo.

915
00:57:23,828 --> 00:57:25,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was craptacular.

916
00:57:25,929 --> 00:57:27,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't like it, not gonna buy the game.

917
00:57:27,889 --> 00:57:29,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought the controls were crap, too.

918
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:32,512
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't feel fluid to me.

919
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:39,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless something big changes between this demo and the final release, I am in no way interested in Tomb Raider Legends.

920
00:57:40,135 --> 00:57:40,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

921
00:57:41,094 --> 00:57:46,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched someone play the game and I did like some of the details that they had in, like the water effects looked pretty cool.

922
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:47,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the water effects were crap.

923
00:57:47,456 --> 00:57:51,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get to a point where you were like behind the waterfall and the camera would get behind the waterfall?

924
00:57:51,457 --> 00:57:52,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked like crap.

925
00:57:52,497 --> 00:57:54,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like a bunch of snow, like white snow on the screen.

926
00:57:54,778 --> 00:57:55,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see that.

927
00:57:55,258 --> 00:58:01,540
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, I did like the smoke coming out of the guns, even though it looked kind of blocky, but still kind of neat.

928
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,981
[SPEAKER_02]: And the voice acting, I guess, was okay.

929
00:58:05,401 --> 00:58:07,642
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't like Tomb Raider, period.

930
00:58:07,862 --> 00:58:08,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And so...

931
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:10,010
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

932
00:58:39,978 --> 00:58:43,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Gizem in our chatroom says, bah, on the Tomb Raider, hey, I like the demo.

933
00:58:43,622 --> 00:58:44,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, to each their own.

934
00:58:44,743 --> 00:58:46,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's people that disagree with me.

935
00:58:46,225 --> 00:58:47,025
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I know there are.

936
00:58:47,326 --> 00:58:49,768
[SPEAKER_04]: In reading some websites and things, there's people that disagree with me.

937
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:51,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like it.

938
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:52,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't get what the big deal is.

939
00:58:53,513 --> 00:58:54,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't sell me on it.

940
00:58:54,414 --> 00:58:54,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

941
00:58:55,295 --> 00:58:56,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's just not my kind of game.

942
00:58:57,228 --> 00:58:57,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

943
00:58:57,628 --> 00:59:00,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not huge on the platformers anymore.

944
00:59:00,589 --> 00:59:09,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro and those type of games, but I don't know how huge... But that's not true, because Mario I still like and those types of things.

945
00:59:09,252 --> 00:59:13,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know what Tomb Raider's problem is, but I didn't like it.

946
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:14,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

947
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:18,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to another story.

948
00:59:20,575 --> 00:59:20,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki!

949
00:59:21,456 --> 00:59:24,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of stuff going on with Oblivion this week, right?

950
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:25,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of controversy and things?

951
00:59:25,879 --> 00:59:27,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, lots of stuff.

952
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,181
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more like it.

953
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:36,785
[SPEAKER_02]: They had this stupid... I don't even know why the hell anyone would buy this, but they had this stupid thing that they put on the marketplace.

954
00:59:37,465 --> 00:59:38,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a horse armor pack.

955
00:59:38,686 --> 00:59:41,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember talking about this a while back when they announced this.

956
00:59:41,668 --> 00:59:44,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically just like it sounds.

957
00:59:44,389 --> 00:59:45,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Horse armor pack.

958
00:59:46,414 --> 00:59:48,856
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not different stats or anything, right?

959
00:59:49,596 --> 00:59:52,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess your horse is armored now, a little bit.

960
00:59:53,158 --> 00:59:53,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

961
00:59:54,339 --> 00:59:56,461
[SPEAKER_02]: It costs you money, first off.

962
00:59:56,481 --> 00:59:58,302
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 Microsoft points, which is, I think, about $3.

963
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:02,284
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to buy the armor in the game.

964
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,066
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't just get the armor.

965
01:00:04,466 --> 01:00:05,847
[SPEAKER_02]: It just makes it available for purchase.

966
01:00:06,968 --> 01:00:09,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so you don't even get the armor on your horse automatically.

967
01:00:09,409 --> 01:00:10,710
[SPEAKER_04]: You still have to work for it in the game.

968
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:11,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

969
01:00:11,471 --> 01:00:12,151
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crappy.

970
01:00:13,392 --> 01:00:13,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

971
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:15,171
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, it looks stupid.

972
01:00:15,972 --> 01:00:28,202
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, I'm paying $2 for a graphic file that's probably 400 pixels by 400 pixels that's going to be laid around my horse in a shapely way.

973
01:00:28,622 --> 01:00:29,363
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm paying for.

974
01:00:30,304 --> 01:00:32,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm paying for a sprite.

975
01:00:33,887 --> 01:00:34,747
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not paying for a sprite.

976
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:36,969
[SPEAKER_02]: You're paying for a polygon model.

977
01:00:37,109 --> 01:00:37,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

978
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,371
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, yeah.

979
01:00:39,391 --> 01:00:39,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Same difference.

980
01:00:42,274 --> 01:00:42,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

981
01:00:43,055 --> 01:00:43,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's stupid.

982
01:00:44,036 --> 01:00:48,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Then again, I know enough people obsessed with Oblivion that they're probably excited about this.

983
01:01:05,305 --> 01:01:06,446
[SPEAKER_02]: There, you're at the town.

984
01:01:06,786 --> 01:01:09,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you don't have to ride a horse anywhere.

985
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:10,009
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not required.

986
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:11,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So, who cares?

987
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:21,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And besides, I heard there's a part in the game where you can actually get a horse that is armored or, like, undead or something, and it basically can't be hurt anyways.

988
01:01:21,557 --> 01:01:24,099
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what's the point in getting a horse armor anyways?

989
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:25,860
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, though?

990
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:30,604
[SPEAKER_02]: For all of this common sense... And you're not going to show it to any of your friends anyways because the game's not on live, so...

991
01:01:31,607 --> 01:01:32,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

992
01:01:32,928 --> 01:01:48,296
[SPEAKER_01]: For all of this common sense, though, I saw on LiveJournal at least 20 people who had talked about purchasing this pack as a positive thing, as buying upgrades for so small amounts of money being a good thing in the direction that gaming is going.

993
01:01:48,536 --> 01:01:49,557
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

994
01:02:10,174 --> 01:02:18,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's tough, because Halo was even weirder, because the maps were free, but you could buy them three months in advance for so much amount of money.

995
01:02:18,379 --> 01:02:19,900
[SPEAKER_04]: That was always kind of weird to me, too.

996
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:28,365
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of things on the original Xbox would be free, like additional maps and things on different games, and costumes and things.

997
01:02:28,705 --> 01:02:37,771
[SPEAKER_04]: The only things that I remember paying for would be songs in DDR, which to me is a little different, because you're really adding to the game...

998
01:02:38,351 --> 01:02:42,613
[SPEAKER_04]: by getting brand new songs to play and step charts and everything, but I don't know.

999
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:44,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe people would disagree with me and say that's a waste.

1000
01:02:44,574 --> 01:02:53,218
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why they charged what they did for this is because Cameo, they have the new costume things, and that's what they charge for their costumes, so they took it as an example to charge that for it.

1001
01:02:54,439 --> 01:02:55,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's kind of crappy, too.

1002
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.

1003
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:01,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Cameo's retarded in the fact that you can download costumes that do nothing other than reskin the character.

1004
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:04,564
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can dress like Killer Instinct characters.

1005
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

1006
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:11,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

1007
01:03:11,682 --> 01:03:13,303
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't make Cameo better.

1008
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:14,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Including Orkut.

1009
01:03:14,103 --> 01:03:15,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing would make Cameo better.

1010
01:03:15,904 --> 01:03:16,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1011
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:16,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's kind of cool.

1012
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:18,286
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm still not going to pay for that.

1013
01:03:19,547 --> 01:03:20,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to pay for that.

1014
01:03:22,268 --> 01:03:23,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Horse armor.

1015
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:24,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously?

1016
01:03:26,051 --> 01:03:26,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1017
01:03:27,732 --> 01:03:29,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you need horse armor anyways?

1018
01:03:29,493 --> 01:03:33,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a hard enough time killing somebody that's a human, let alone a horse.

1019
01:03:36,874 --> 01:03:38,915
[SPEAKER_02]: What else have they modded in Oblivion lately?

1020
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things that they've modded in Oblivion.

1021
01:03:43,217 --> 01:03:50,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like most things that have to do with the PC, they have released a topless mod.

1022
01:03:51,201 --> 01:03:51,782
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1023
01:03:52,302 --> 01:03:56,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Your Oblivion characters, or female characters, can go wild.

1024
01:03:57,444 --> 01:04:00,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have this patch out there.

1025
01:04:00,026 --> 01:04:00,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently...

1026
01:04:01,269 --> 01:04:02,910
[SPEAKER_02]: All they've done is remove the clothing.

1027
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:08,034
[SPEAKER_02]: This skin was already in there, so I guess you can kind of almost say, Oh, no!

1028
01:04:08,535 --> 01:04:12,157
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, a hot coffee mod type thing without sex.

1029
01:04:12,377 --> 01:04:22,925
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, pretty much there's really nasty, ugly people because, of course, any character you generate with the character generator is ugly that are naked.

1030
01:04:23,306 --> 01:04:25,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So, really nasty, ugly, naked people.

1031
01:04:26,148 --> 01:04:26,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

1032
01:04:26,308 --> 01:04:26,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

1033
01:04:28,314 --> 01:04:32,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it whenever there's a game that comes out, somebody finds out a way to make the lead character naked?

1034
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:34,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, always, without fail.

1035
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:35,901
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to hear something funny?

1036
01:04:36,121 --> 01:04:37,082
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a great story.

1037
01:04:37,202 --> 01:04:37,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1038
01:04:38,103 --> 01:04:38,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I?

1039
01:04:38,903 --> 01:04:42,226
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about Tomb Raider, and about how it might be delayed.

1040
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:54,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, and this is why here, there is a certain scene in the game where, I'm not sure if it's Lara Croft or if it's one of the other sub-characters that's in there, but

1041
01:04:54,884 --> 01:04:55,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1042
01:05:12,335 --> 01:05:13,576
[SPEAKER_02]: So popping out would not be good.

1043
01:05:14,616 --> 01:05:17,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Gizem says, OMG, I need the PC version now.

1044
01:05:17,377 --> 01:05:17,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Fat, fat, fat.

1045
01:05:18,378 --> 01:05:22,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Laser123454321 says, Girls Gone Wild in Oblivion.

1046
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:26,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireboma says you can be like that guy who was wanking off to World of Warcraft.

1047
01:05:27,062 --> 01:05:31,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Oblivion, I think it's great that they have a PC mod thing so you can actually mod PC versions.

1048
01:05:32,024 --> 01:05:38,327
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's another thing, too, is then why would I want to buy the horse armor mod for the PC if I can just mod it for free?

1049
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:40,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1050
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:42,590
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1051
01:05:43,431 --> 01:05:49,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, we're going to go to another story here, and it's actually a contest.

1052
01:05:50,778 --> 01:05:51,418
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1053
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:58,444
[SPEAKER_04]: We are giving away some prize packs from 24 The Game.

1054
01:06:00,026 --> 01:06:03,269
[SPEAKER_04]: We were kind enough to get passed along some prize packs for 24 The Game.

1055
01:06:03,289 --> 01:06:05,391
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give it away on tonight's program.

1056
01:06:06,773 --> 01:06:08,874
[SPEAKER_04]: and all you have to do is send us an email.

1057
01:06:08,934 --> 01:06:22,780
[SPEAKER_04]: The email is jack24 at orangeloungeradio.com That's all one word, jack24 at orangeloungeradio.com The prize pack includes a copy of the game, a CTU t-shirt or a You Don't Know Jack t-shirt, a 24 mouse pad,

1058
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:28,786
[SPEAKER_04]: A 24 coffee mug and a 24 keychain all comes with us.

1059
01:06:28,826 --> 01:06:32,149
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have to do, send us an email, jack24 at orangelaunchradio.com.

1060
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:37,215
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you've been watching the show 24 this season, you know that the body count has been through the roof this season.

1061
01:06:37,475 --> 01:06:39,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost annoying how many people have died.

1062
01:06:39,938 --> 01:06:41,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Like tons of people's favorites have died.

1063
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,622
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have to do, do a little research.

1064
01:06:44,429 --> 01:06:46,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully you're a fan of the show and you already know.

1065
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:50,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me any two people that have died this season.

1066
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Any two people that have died this season on the show.

1067
01:06:53,171 --> 01:07:02,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will qualify you to win the 24 prize pack, copy of the game, CTU t-shirt or You Don't Know Jack t-shirt, 24 mouse pad, 24 coffee mug, and a 24 keychain.

1068
01:07:02,813 --> 01:07:04,893
[SPEAKER_04]: That's jack24 at orangehauntradio.com.

1069
01:07:05,213 --> 01:07:07,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Any two people that have died in season 5 of 24.

1070
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:11,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Random extra number 1 and random extra number 2, that doesn't count.

1071
01:07:11,475 --> 01:07:13,475
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to give me names of actual characters, okay?

1072
01:07:14,383 --> 01:07:15,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Main characters.

1073
01:07:16,444 --> 01:07:18,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even supplemental characters will work.

1074
01:07:18,685 --> 01:07:20,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Because main characters is a little vague.

1075
01:07:20,386 --> 01:07:22,847
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's got to be somebody that has a name.

1076
01:07:22,967 --> 01:07:23,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put it that way.

1077
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:24,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So random extra.

1078
01:07:24,568 --> 01:07:28,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you saw the episode where people were dropping like flies at CTU, then work.

1079
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:30,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you can name me specific people that were involved in that.

1080
01:07:31,391 --> 01:07:31,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.

1081
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:32,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

1082
01:07:32,732 --> 01:07:33,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.

1083
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:37,974
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, in segment B, we're going to give away an Amped 3 prize pack.

1084
01:07:37,994 --> 01:07:38,635
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay tuned.

1085
01:07:38,955 --> 01:07:39,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

1086
01:07:40,075 --> 01:07:40,676
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great game.

1087
01:07:41,276 --> 01:07:41,556
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1088
01:07:42,344 --> 01:07:44,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, let's go to another story.

1089
01:07:45,306 --> 01:07:50,208
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an open letter from Sony Online Entertainment to PC Gamer Magazine.

1090
01:07:50,248 --> 01:07:51,389
[SPEAKER_04]: This was kind of interesting.

1091
01:07:51,709 --> 01:07:54,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony Online Entertainment actually wrote to the magazine.

1092
01:07:55,311 --> 01:08:04,055
[SPEAKER_04]: You may remember that PC Gamer Magazine said they were no longer going to accept ads from gill sellers and gold sellers and other types of currency sellers.

1093
01:08:04,075 --> 01:08:05,316
[SPEAKER_04]: They were not going to put this in their magazine.

1094
01:08:05,676 --> 01:08:07,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sony Online Entertainment wrote this letter.

1095
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:10,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And Joystick is actually where I got a copy of this letter from.

1096
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:11,919
[SPEAKER_04]: You can check it out over there.

1097
01:08:12,619 --> 01:08:24,070
[SPEAKER_04]: In this letter they were saying that these companies that sell these and the farmers that usually accompany their services have been as much of an issue for our company as they are for your readers, the people who play online games.

1098
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:29,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Over the last few years the problems associated with the secondary market have impacted Sony Online Entertainment greatly.

1099
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:33,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah blah blah blah blah, gold farmers are evil, blah blah blah blah blah.

1100
01:08:33,758 --> 01:08:36,640
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the part of the letter I think that's interesting.

1101
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:50,308
[SPEAKER_04]: We have taken substantial steps towards solving these and other problems, as well as balancing the desires of those who wish to engage in legitimate real money transactions by launching Station Exchange in EverQuest 2.

1102
01:08:50,968 --> 01:08:54,270
[SPEAKER_04]: We will continue to develop innovative solutions in the future.

1103
01:08:55,131 --> 01:09:00,554
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, what they're saying is that selling things for money is bad unless it's us doing it.

1104
01:09:01,755 --> 01:09:01,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1105
01:09:02,907 --> 01:09:04,048
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bad, okay?

1106
01:09:04,128 --> 01:09:06,208
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as we get a cut, it's good.

1107
01:09:06,388 --> 01:09:09,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anything strike somebody funny there about that?

1108
01:09:15,172 --> 01:09:16,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't there a weird inconsistency there?

1109
01:09:17,113 --> 01:09:20,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, couldn't they have just left that part out in their little letter?

1110
01:09:20,734 --> 01:09:23,696
[SPEAKER_04]: The little plug for their service for selling things?

1111
01:09:23,896 --> 01:09:24,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think so.

1112
01:09:25,697 --> 01:09:25,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1113
01:09:26,477 --> 01:09:26,777
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

1114
01:09:27,177 --> 01:09:27,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Just my thought.

1115
01:09:27,777 --> 01:09:28,958
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1116
01:09:29,521 --> 01:09:31,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions on the 24 Contest coming from the chatroom.

1117
01:09:31,844 --> 01:09:34,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireboma asks, does it have to be from this season?

1118
01:09:36,388 --> 01:09:39,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they have to be from Season 5 for the 24 Contest.

1119
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:45,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack24 at OrangeLunchRadio.com News story.

1120
01:09:46,197 --> 01:09:48,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, IGN, what did they report this week?

1121
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:51,783
[SPEAKER_02]: They reported stuff that I reported weeks ago.

1122
01:09:52,558 --> 01:09:58,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically saying that Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam is going to be a Revolution launch title.

1123
01:09:58,722 --> 01:10:08,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I reported this back when we had the Activision list from the Destination PlayStation event.

1124
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:12,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So blow me, IGN.

1125
01:10:12,992 --> 01:10:14,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I reported that weeks ago.

1126
01:10:14,894 --> 01:10:15,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Where were you?

1127
01:10:17,095 --> 01:10:18,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're the source.

1128
01:10:18,897 --> 01:10:24,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that'd be surprising to me since they didn't mention a source, so yeah, it could possibly be.

1129
01:10:25,622 --> 01:10:28,724
[SPEAKER_02]: But, hey, what do you expect?

1130
01:10:28,984 --> 01:10:30,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Another launch game, Tony Hawk, cool.

1131
01:10:32,087 --> 01:10:32,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

1132
01:10:35,329 --> 01:10:42,154
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story for you guys, this segment of the program, and it has to do with, oh, who doesn't love Bob Ross?

1133
01:10:42,174 --> 01:10:42,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I

1134
01:10:42,873 --> 01:10:43,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Bob Ross.

1135
01:10:43,874 --> 01:10:46,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember Bob Ross from when I was a kid.

1136
01:10:46,517 --> 01:10:48,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, who doesn't love a white man with an afro?

1137
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:49,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1138
01:10:50,521 --> 01:10:51,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless he's Napoleon Dynamite.

1139
01:10:51,442 --> 01:10:52,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob Ross was awesome.

1140
01:10:52,804 --> 01:10:54,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob Ross was totally awesome.

1141
01:10:55,587 --> 01:10:56,808
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bob Ross is actually...

1142
01:10:57,679 --> 01:10:58,460
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com

1143
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:30,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever owns the rights to him now, they contacted him and they said, the press release is not a joke, but the side effect of people thinking it might help us get noticed.

1144
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:37,068
[SPEAKER_04]: But they really are going to make a game for the DS and the Revolution to teach you how to paint your own happy little tree.

1145
01:11:38,095 --> 01:11:39,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so excited.

1146
01:11:39,476 --> 01:11:42,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't draw for shit, but I will pick up these games.

1147
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:45,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't they release this for the PC, too?

1148
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:48,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Using a stylus or something?

1149
01:11:48,563 --> 01:11:51,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Those tablet things, because I know Jamie bought one of those.

1150
01:11:51,105 --> 01:11:53,047
[SPEAKER_04]: She paid good money for those tablets.

1151
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:56,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think enough people own those, but I think it's a good idea.

1152
01:11:58,411 --> 01:11:58,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

1153
01:12:01,534 --> 01:12:05,477
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, is this the next logical evolution of a Mario Paint type game?

1154
01:12:06,641 --> 01:12:07,922
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very good question.

1155
01:12:08,102 --> 01:12:14,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we haven't seen Mario Paint on any system lately, and I'm kind of surprised we haven't seen it on the DS yet.

1156
01:12:14,888 --> 01:12:20,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't Mario Paint seem like a totally logical idea for the DS, especially with the whole dual screen thing?

1157
01:12:20,733 --> 01:12:26,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you could be painting on the bottom screen, and the upper screen could be showing coordinated music or animation.

1158
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:31,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, let's face it, Mario Paint for the Super Nintendo, it kind of sucked.

1159
01:12:32,406 --> 01:12:37,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lot of us have fond memories of it, and the things that were in Nintendo Power.

1160
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:45,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember Nintendo Power had a little guide, and you could create your own little things from it, like the musics and the animations.

1161
01:12:45,538 --> 01:12:46,999
[SPEAKER_04]: It would show you how to do it step by step.

1162
01:12:47,299 --> 01:12:52,003
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the big scope of things, you could only really do nine frames of a small animation.

1163
01:12:52,344 --> 01:12:53,364
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really shitty.

1164
01:12:53,765 --> 01:12:58,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we have fond memories of it, but it really wasn't that great.

1165
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:04,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think a game like that could be pretty awesome, especially with, hello, Wi-Fi.

1166
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:06,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I could beam things across.

1167
01:13:06,692 --> 01:13:12,053
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be like the evolution of PictoChat and maybe a way to commercialize PictoChat and get a little money off it.

1168
01:13:12,073 --> 01:13:16,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Because think about Mario Paint could be like something you could chat with people online.

1169
01:13:16,814 --> 01:13:19,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if they're going to include PictoChat as part of the revolution.

1170
01:13:20,882 --> 01:13:21,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly.

1171
01:13:21,322 --> 01:13:22,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the internet.

1172
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:22,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

1173
01:13:22,984 --> 01:13:27,347
[SPEAKER_01]: But then are we going to get close to PictoRape that we were talking about earlier?

1174
01:13:27,367 --> 01:13:31,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you mean like... Well, no, because you know Nintendo would say everybody has to be on the friends list.

1175
01:13:32,111 --> 01:13:33,172
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to be your friends list.

1176
01:13:33,893 --> 01:13:34,754
[SPEAKER_04]: People.

1177
01:13:35,154 --> 01:13:38,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know in Metroid you can't voice chat with people unless they're your friends list people?

1178
01:13:38,737 --> 01:13:38,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1179
01:13:39,097 --> 01:13:39,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1180
01:13:39,838 --> 01:13:41,199
[SPEAKER_04]: So that whole like, ooh, voice chat.

1181
01:13:41,499 --> 01:13:47,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I have maybe like two people on my Metroid friends list and I haven't really played Metroid lately because of all these other damn games that have come out.

1182
01:13:48,025 --> 01:13:48,125
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1183
01:13:49,042 --> 01:13:53,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if Bob Ross and his happy little trees, they'll probably be M-rated, you know.

1184
01:13:54,024 --> 01:14:02,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because of the fact that I might be able to paint a penis or a vagina in this game, which is likely to be the first thing many of you try to paint.

1185
01:14:02,747 --> 01:14:04,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be a happy little vagina?

1186
01:14:05,168 --> 01:14:07,789
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be a very happy little penis or vagina.

1187
01:14:10,549 --> 01:14:13,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this game have to be rated M because of what you can do with your imagination?

1188
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:14,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1189
01:14:15,595 --> 01:14:20,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine some parent suing Bob Ross Foundation or whatever over this horrible, horrific game?

1190
01:14:20,776 --> 01:14:22,277
[SPEAKER_04]: My kid painted a penis!

1191
01:14:27,758 --> 01:14:32,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that note, I think we're going to go ahead and go to our break.

1192
01:14:32,599 --> 01:14:33,579
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay tuned.

1193
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:36,560
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come back at you a little later with Part B of tonight's show.

1194
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:47,519
