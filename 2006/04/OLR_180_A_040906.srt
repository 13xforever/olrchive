00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today, April 9th, 2006, new screenshots from the revolution hit the internet, Xbox Live

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,920
prepares for lots of new arcade games, and which Japanese company might be finding itself

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,920
in big trouble this tax season.

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there in the podcast universe or the live streaming radio

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,280
universe you are listening to

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,120
Orange Lounge Radio episode number one hundred and eighty

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,880
for April the ninth two thousand six. How you guys doing out there? My name is Rob Roberts

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,320
you might know me as Sky.

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,300
Not with us tonight is Dark Sakura also known as Jamie Summers. She's sick. She

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,160
She has Asian bird flu, I think.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,280
She has a really high fever or something, so she had to call in tonight.

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,420
So we hope you feel better soon, DarkSakura, if you're out there listening.

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,580
Secretly though, I think she's just like, you know how when a really popular video game

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,580
would come out, you'd stay at home, call in sick and play hooky to play that game?

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,500
I think Kingdom Hearts 2 did that to her.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,980
I think she called in sick to stay home and play Kingdom Hearts 2.

17
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,980
No, of course I'm teasing.

18
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,220
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

19
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,120
You know, what's funny is I feel like I'm actually Jamie right now because

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,580
Because you're sitting in a chair with a laptop

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,420
Yeah, I know cuz you got your new laptop, didn't you? Yeah, so this is weird and you did not buy a Mac

22
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,660
I did not buy a Mac despite the advice of our listeners. I don't like honestly you got to compare the specs and

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,020
Then you see clearly that you know the way to go

24
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,440
Is the way I did. Well, I'm not a fan of Gateway. How's that feel?

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,340
I'm not a fan of gateway either to be honest, but you know what this computer is at the right price and have the right specs

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,320
To me gateway is merely the case. It's in so all right, whatever all right

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,880
Well say helping us out tonight since we're one person short

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,640
So we had to call on someone at the last minute and always prepared to lend a hand say hello to spike

29
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,280
Hello, how you doing? I'm doing very good good good to hear it

30
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,560
Alright, he's feeling a little pressure a little bit because we literally asked him

31
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,520
about oh an hour ago, hey can you sit in and be a host tonight on a radio program on the

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
internet?

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,920
But you've done this before, you've been here before.

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
It's always good times.

35
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,520
Alright, yeah you know a lot about games, I know you don't really lead it on very much,

36
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,000
you know a lot about games, you really do.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,040
What was that Japanese game you're saying you're going to bring me next week that was

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,720
some PS2 launch title?

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
Primal Image.

40
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,280
Okay, let me set up the story a little bit.

41
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,720
We were at Walmart last night for some ungodly, I hate Walmart, I don't know why I was there,

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,280
But we were at Walmart last night, and I was talking about, oh, Rumble Roses XX, because

43
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,840
we saw it there, and I said pretty much the only reason that you would want to get Rumble

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,720
Roses XX is for the photo-taking mode of where you can take dirty pictures of all the wrestlers.

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,880
It's like, you know, I don't know, it's the best feature of the game, because the game

46
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,600
itself is very slow and boring.

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,360
But you said it reminded you of this game, my description.

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:15,580
It's basically Pokemon Snap with half-naked virtual models, and they go around doing their

49
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:21,660
various poses as you circle around them, taking photos, and you get bonus points for the sort

50
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,780
of more suggestive photos you take.

51
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,780
Very fun.

52
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,980
But they did not release this game in the US?

53
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,980
Sadly, no.

54
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,980
Gee, I wonder why.

55
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,980
Alright.

56
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,220
Well, maybe, I'll be, hopefully Spike will bring a copy of that for me next week so I

57
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,180
take a look at it cuz I really want to play that game and check out cuz I love

58
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,420
Pokemon snap so I don't see why I wouldn't love this game I mean Pokemon

59
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,180
snap was one of the reasons to own a 64 like like those like the greatest games

60
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,060
you have Mario 64 Mario Kart 64 and then Pokemon snap is where it's at I

61
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,780
don't care what you haters say and mischief makers I know I never played

62
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,660
that what is that oh you've got drop jaw what is mischief makers I've never heard

63
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,420
of this I've heard of mischief makers it's not as bad as it sounds what is it

64
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,420
Tell me, what is this game? What are you doing it?

65
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,420
If I remember correctly, it's based off an anime, I want to say.

66
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,420
No, don't look like that. It's not like that. It's a good game.

67
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,420
It's not a... It's an anime game.

68
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,420
Alright.

69
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,420
Alright, we're going to go around and start this show off as we usually do with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week,

70
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,420
where we go around and check in and see what we've been playing this week and what we like and what we hate.

71
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,420
Loki, what have you been playing this week?

72
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:37,780
I've been playing Far Cry Instincts Predator, and that game's pretty, I don't know, long.

73
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,860
It's a fun game, you know, but then again, it's one of those games, like achievement-wise,

74
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,900
if you're going for achievement points in this game, might as well spend your time elsewhere

75
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:55,580
because to beat the game, you get 10 points, and you have to beat it in every single difficulty

76
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,660
through both the Instinct storyline and the Evolution storyline, and then do a bunch of

77
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,000
shit where some of those xbox live arcade games are like you press the L trigger you

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,280
get 20 points that would be hilarious to have like a game with a thousand achievements in

79
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,840
each one's a point you know like pushing direction up pushing direction down that would be hilarious

80
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,840
but no unfortunately can you imagine if DDR comes out for the xbox 360 what the achievement

81
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,760
points for that are gonna be like that's gonna be cake it's gonna be serious cake but um

82
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,160
You played with a mat instead of a controller. You get 500 points.

83
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,200
Oh my gods, you beat Max Limited!

84
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,760
Go outside!

85
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,040
Now, um...

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,080
I don't know, so that game's kind of fun.

87
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,640
I did get Rumble Roses XX. I did not buy Rumble Roses XX, just to make that clear.

88
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,360
I would not spend money on that game, unfortunately, but

89
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,240
I did get it. I haven't played it, though, yet, because I, you know, got a laptop and

90
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,400
haven't had a chance to waste time on it in that game.

91
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:04,100
it looked interesting, I guess. Right now I've gotten pretty much every game for March

92
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:09,920
except for Blazing Angels, and that's the only one I don't have yet. But I'm not really

93
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,100
going to be buying games until June now, because I don't like Tomb Raider. I don't really care

94
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:21,000
for Top Spin. Battlefield 2, I've never played it, don't really care. And the stuff in May,

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,320
X-Men 3, maybe Time Shift, and MotoGP 2006 moved, and Rockstar's Table Tennis, no thank

96
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
you.

97
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,840
I don't know, I have to admit, my interest has somewhat peaked at Rockstar Table Tennis,

98
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
I must say.

99
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,320
I've been playing, of course, more Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City Stories.

100
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
It's just fun.

101
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,000
I've been six months, I mean, now it doesn't get old.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's just really fun.

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,120
The multiplayer is the best part, and I hope the god that it has the multiplayer when it

104
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,120
it comes out on the PlayStation 2 version. Instincts tell me, though, no. It's not gonna.

105
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,120
All right. Anything else? That's it. All right. Spike, my friend, what have you been playing

106
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,920
this week? I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 12 or 11. Oh my god. You're just,

107
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,400
you're too eager for the 12, aren't you? I am. I want to play it so badly, which is a

108
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,460
marked change from how I felt initially, but now all my time with 11 has me really excited

109
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,460
about that same base gameplay, but with a story!

110
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,960
See? That's what I'm telling people! To really appreciate the Final Fantasy XII demo, you

111
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,600
must have had some exposure to XI. Yeah, it's true. I definitely agree with you now. I'm

112
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:35,020
also replaying Kingdom Hearts, the first game, to get ready for the second one, and... Is

113
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,800
this because you're poor and you'll have to wait until it's a $20 game? That's almost

114
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,400
exactly what I... I'm just giving you a hard time. But yeah, I put in 17 hours over that

115
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:54,160
last week. Dang! And I forgot how much I hated the camera, but I really like everything else

116
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,100
about the game. That perfectly sums up my review of Kingdom Hearts, the first one. Hate

117
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,700
the camera, love everything else. So yeah, that's my week in gaming. Awesome. Let's see

118
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,600
what I've been playing this week. I just picked up Top Spin 2, the tennis game on the Xbox

119
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,080
360, which was the only Xbox 360 game I played at last year's E3, so I think it has somewhat

120
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,000
sentimental value to me, because it was the only game that had no lines last year at E3.

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,920
I think, no, I actually played it, instead of playing it at the Microsoft booth, I played

122
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,380
it at 2K Games' booth, and there wasn't nearly as many people there, because they were kind

123
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,560
of in a different spot.

124
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,000
So I got to play Top Spin 2, and I don't think I've played this game thoroughly enough to

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,040
give it a good review yet.

126
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:41,120
I did notice, like, my first impressions were character creation, whoa, like, okay, it's

127
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,680
right up there with Oblivion, okay?

128
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,820
You know how Oblivion will let you totally customize everything?

129
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,600
The only thing that Topspin 2 is missing is Night Elves, okay?

130
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,940
Otherwise, it's just his throw, and that would be pretty badass if he could be a Night

131
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,680
Elf tennis player, I must say.

132
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,440
Now, I saw something with Oblivion, someone made Chuck Norris.

133
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,160
Oh, I read about that on the internet.

134
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,920
Young Chuck Norris thing, it's hilarious.

135
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
What exactly did they do with that?

136
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,720
There was a skit that they did on Saturday Night Live, Young Chuck Norris, and the whole

137
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,720
song that goes along with that and he kicked and he punched and it's really funny, you

138
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,480
gotta check it out, I think it's on YouTube and they really, just using the normal character

139
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,240
creation, they made it really look like Chuck Norris and it was hilarious because he was

140
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,440
beating up the shop owner and it went through basically everything that was on the Saturday

141
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,560
Night Live music video, they just kind of recreated it in oblivion and it was pretty

142
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
funny.

143
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Awesome.

144
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Besides the character creation, then I started doing career mode a little bit, but I found

145
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,600
that I kind of sucked at the game because I didn't know what I was doing.

146
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,980
I didn't think the game had a very friendly tutorial mode or anything.

147
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,640
There was really nothing to tell me, press A to do a light bounce, press X to do a slice

148
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,280
and all that stuff.

149
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,500
I would like a tennis game that's built for the retarded tennis player like myself who

150
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:08,660
who is too fat to play real tennis, who might be able to benefit from knowing what a slice

151
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,580
really is, assuming maybe I haven't played tennis before.

152
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,020
I know what it is, but I would have liked something that really started me from an amateur

153
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,360
level, whereas the game threw me right in there and expected me to know stuff.

154
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,380
Even in the first training, it's like, okay, you've got to serve ten balls, and you're

155
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,080
like, okay, what the hell am I doing?

156
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,100
It didn't really explain it for me, so I actually had to open the instruction manual and read

157
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
it.

158
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,700
to do that with games. Extraction manuals are dated things. I don't ever read instruction

159
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,300
manuals with games, ever. I don't need them, usually, but I needed it for this. That made

160
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,980
me a little sad. But the graphics are really pretty, and I played a tournament in a Japanese

161
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,140
cup or something, and it was all decorated, very Japanese style, totally stereotypical,

162
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,880
but it was cool. Besides that, I've been playing Holdovers from last week, Beatmania, Kingdom

163
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,960
Hearts 2, and I downloaded Feeding Frenzy, which is an Xbox Live Arcade title, which

164
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,760
I guess came out a couple weeks ago, because I wanted a new arcade game, and Street Fighter

165
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,200
2 is still not available.

166
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
What the hell's with that?

167
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
I don't know.

168
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,400
Well, they had major lag problems that they had to fix.

169
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,680
A friend of a friend mentioned that there's major lag issues going on, and that's, I don't

170
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,240
think, supposed to be very well known, but there were lag problems to the extreme, so.

171
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,240
So it's supposed to be coming out, I think, at the end of this month.

172
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
That's what they say.

173
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
I think we have a story on it later.

174
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
Then again, they said that last month too.

175
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
That's very true.

176
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,520
So I don't trust them until the damn thing's on the marketplace.

177
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,720
So I downloaded Feeding Frenzy instead because I remember this game because I've played a

178
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,360
game at Dave and Buster's that's just like it, except it gives you tickets when you do

179
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,400
really well.

180
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,520
And to be honest, I think I prefer this game when it gives you tickets.

181
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,960
Because this game was kind of junky, like it's really boring and you do the same thing

182
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
over and over.

183
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,120
sat there for like two hours just to play this game until I died I beat the

184
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,160
game the very first time I ever played it and got something like 75 achievement

185
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,400
points for doing so like it was it was cake and I think it's because geometry

186
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,440
wars I and I really suck at geometry wars but it has me skilled enough to

187
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,760
dodge things really well using the analog stick like using my sprite to

188
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,640
dodge things and that's pretty much all feeding frenzy is is a poor man's

189
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,720
Geometry Wars with no shooter so no it's just I here's the thing I don't like

190
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,400
about these some of these trackball because that game is way better with the

191
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,360
trackball than it is a controller I didn't mind the controller because I am

192
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,520
the game's okay I do like the fact that saves your progress so because the game

193
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,280
is kind of crappy I wouldn't want to have to go back and replay the whole

194
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:47,560
game the thing though I don't like about it is it all these web games are getting

195
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,780
You know poured over there just flash games. Yep, and let me take a moment to introduce the chat room over at

196
00:12:53,540 --> 00:13:00,540
www.orangelaundrydo.com click on chat. We do tape live every Sunday night to provide linear listener interaction

197
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,720
We're one of the few podcasts that allow this. It's awesome. We love doing this

198
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:10,760
And you guys get your input gk 128 says in the chat room feeding frenzy free on the PC

199
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,900
$10 on Xbox Live Arcade and you know what you're absolutely right. I'm a consumer whore. There's absolutely no

200
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,180
No reason I should have paid for this except for the fact that as opposed to sitting in

201
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,060
my little office chair and playing on the PC little screen, I like being able to plop

202
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:32,220
my butt on the couch, have my cup of tea or whatever I'm drinking that night, and play

203
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,060
on the HDTV.

204
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,500
There's something to be said about that.

205
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,140
That's why I plan to get Final Fantasy XI in a couple weeks, which makes absolutely

206
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,660
no sense because I already have it on the PC, but I'm just that lazy where I want to

207
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,780
plop on the couch and not have to move or anything and lay down and you know

208
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:54,620
all that stuff just make sure you buy USB mouse and keyboard because well X

209
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,220
defers upgrading so I think I'm gonna steal that one and use it as the Xbox

210
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,220
thingy okay I'm just saying though make sure cuz yeah no there is no way in hell

211
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,180
I would play and I would advise anybody out there it's gonna get into Final

212
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,900
Fantasy 11 on Xbox 360 do yourself a favor buy a USB keyboard and a USB mouse

213
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,580
because you will be a sad sad person otherwise

214
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,500
actually you might be able to fake it without the mouse

215
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,540
you could probably do it without the keyboard

216
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,740
yeah the mouse because I remember I didn't really use the mouse at all

217
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,260
during the game so keyboard's fine especially with all the shortcuts and

218
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,460
everything so that's

219
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,820
not a problem and honestly I already have a USB mouse that I use on my laptop

220
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,940
and it's wireless so why not just take it and use it on the 360 that's what I plan on doing

221
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,100
and the keyboard's good anyways because you can actually use it in other games like for

222
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,460
example putting in cheat codes in Far Cry and Stinks

223
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,340
it makes it a lot easier with the keyboard. There you go.

224
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,280
Alright, let's see other comments in our chat room. VXJsonXV says

225
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,300
Street Fighter 2 is now on GameTap.

226
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,080
That's right, GameTap did a big update this week and I forgot that's another game I've

227
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,880
been playing.

228
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,400
Magic Sword is now on GameTap.

229
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,240
Hello, like one of my favorite Capcom games ever.

230
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,160
That's the greatest news I've heard all day. There you go. Hopefully I made

231
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,820
someone else's week there.

232
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,100
For GameTap's $10 a month thingy, you can do the Magic Sword.

233
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,240
And I think they added a whole bunch of other Capcom stuff.

234
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,940
Knights of the Round, I think, was on there too.

235
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,660
Any word on Black Tiger?

236
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,420
No, but VX JasonXV stays on top of that stuff

237
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,860
more than I do, so he will probably be able to say.

238
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,020
He did tell me King's Quest is on the way though.

239
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,940
He saw in some movie thing on GameTap TV

240
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,040
that King's Quest is coming,

241
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,900
and to which I said something about, oh, it's about time.

242
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,900
Let's see, other questions.

243
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,460
I noticed our chat room is playing Mario Kart DS tonight,

244
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,020
so if you're trying to find friends for DS

245
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,700
you're listening live, go to orangehonoredradio.com and click on chat and you can find some folks

246
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,300
to play Mario Kart DS with.

247
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:49,660
I do see a lot of agreements for Mischief Makers, Hitstun in our chatroom says, Mischief

248
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,340
Makers fucking owns, and I quote, so somebody knew what you were talking about, Spirit Snare

249
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,420
agrees Mischief Makers was indeed awesome.

250
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,400
That's because you guys have the best listeners.

251
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,820
We do, we seriously do.

252
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,020
I love our listeners, they're so awesome, we've got a full chatroom tonight, I demanded

253
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,580
last week that more people visit our MySpace and it worked we've like doubled

254
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,020
our numbers on MySpace and people are actually leaving us comments now it's

255
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,900
awesome I love you guys for doing that if you want to visit myspace.com slash

256
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,780
orange launch radio all one word so hurry before they take MySpace down

257
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:27,140
because of all the you know controversial things that go on there

258
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,980
like the scary old men that search out 17 year olds all right oh yeah VXJXV

259
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,940
That's Xbox Live, isn't it?

260
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,940
No.

261
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,300
Remember the story from the, what was it, Philadelphia or Pittsburgh News that said

262
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,020
the Nintendo DS is the new stalker system.

263
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,100
Your little girl might go on PictoChat and get raped.

264
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,460
I mean, seriously.

265
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,100
What the hell was that?

266
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,220
That news is like two months old.

267
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,180
I would love to do that, just like, you know, do a little skit or something, like doing

268
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:01,460
PictoChat and says, I'm going to rape you, and then have like a picture to go with it.

269
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:08,940
Just save these ideas for OLR TV before you know who steals it.

270
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:14,160
But wait, I was going to say, the videos, speaking of which, you updated OLR PSP.com

271
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
with videos, right?

272
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
Yeah, that was fun.

273
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,180
Including something that we purposefully cut out of last week's show because it didn't

274
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,020
make the podcast because I had the giggles a little too much going into one segment,

275
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,220
but Dark Sakura had a lot to do with that.

276
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,240
So you tape the whole thing and put a video of it on OLRPSP.com.

277
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
That was fun.

278
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,880
So, more videos to come in the future.

279
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,760
Yeah, more videos to come in the future, we can't say too much yet, but yeah, and I'm

280
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,520
trying to, well, the whole video thing was kind of an experiment because the PSP itself

281
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,200
doesn't like downloading the videos, it thinks it's a webpage.

282
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,000
It's kind of retarded when you think of it because you have to save the link as, so I

283
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,160
got to put some different instructions on there and, you know, work at it that way,

284
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
but...

285
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,200
because we've got something big planned yeah that's all I have to say we got

286
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,920
something big planned for like a month it's gonna be huge yeah huge all right

287
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,960
let's get into some news and we'll start it off tonight with Loki and I got some

288
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,200
news over there on the revolution oh yeah they've actually had some

289
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,700
screenshots of Red Steel one of the games is coming to the revolution leaked

290
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,280
to the internet they're actually out of the new issue of Game Informer the May

291
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:33,280
issue. And you know what? I'm starting to think here that the Revolution might be as

292
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,000
powerful as some of these other systems out there. Especially the next gen stuff. The

293
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,720
pictures look really good actually. And what's interesting is how they describe what you

294
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,720
use the Revolution controller for. For example, the way you hold the controller is actually

295
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,120
the way you hold the gun in the game. So if you want to go gangster and you hold the gun

296
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,800
sideways, your character in game will do that as well.

297
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,120
The other thing which is kind of neat is when you're lobbing grenades you actually use the

298
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,960
controller like you're throwing a grenade or if you want to roll one on the ground ever

299
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,440
so slightly you can do that too which is really neat and use it also as a sword in the game.

300
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,880
But by the screenshots so far I would say this looks pretty on par with even stuff like

301
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:23,240
Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter, and even the Rainbow Six Vegas, it looks really good.

302
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,840
I'm really shocked, especially since they're saying, you know, that the specs aren't that

303
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,200
great and stuff.

304
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,440
I think it looks really good.

305
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,440
This is a great comment from our chat room right here.

306
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:38,000
Ota G says, specs don't make a game look good, developers make games look good.

307
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,720
Exactly, and here's the thing too, and a lot of people, when they're looking at these,

308
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,960
they're saying well you know what just because the specs aren't as powerful

309
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,400
because they're not going HD they can use that extra you know

310
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,680
processing power to make it look even better so

311
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,560
Nintendo can't you do a little HD

312
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,040
well they're doing 480p so that's

313
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,200
something. Does that mean widescreen? That's progressive scan. I know it means progressive scan

314
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,000
does that mean I get widescreen too? I think so

315
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,920
so it's something and you know what

316
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,500
Don't know they can always they can change that later. Maybe I don't know but um

317
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,160
Yeah, I don't know. It just looks really good really good

318
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:25,440
All right now spike. I saw these pictures in your life journal. What do you think of Red Steel? I'm really impressed

319
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,040
I as many others I was really excited about the revolution for the gameplay innovation

320
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:36,480
I had my my hopes set on maybe we'd see games eventually that looked like Resident Evil 4

321
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,260
I'm already like wow, this is this is past that and I'm really impressed. I'm really happy

322
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:47,480
The only issue I have with this and in looking at the pictures, I mean the game looks pretty hot

323
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,200
Don't get me wrong and I'm really glad to see that Nintendo, you know, even if this is leaked out

324
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,280
I'm glad to see we're finally seeing something on the revolution

325
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,060
My only hesitation is that I think a gun game using that controller is like the most cliche thing

326
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,720
You could possibly do although I agree with you. It is a game being produced by Ubisoft

327
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,280
First off, that's kind of expected, I'd think, from them.

328
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,400
But that says to me an even deeper message about developers are taking this very seriously.

329
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,320
They're not just making $10 shovelware ports for the revolution, they're actually coming

330
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,080
up with ideas, and even if they're cliche ideas, they're still putting real resources

331
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,080
behind them.

332
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,600
VXJ6V in chat says cliche but it makes sense

333
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,040
I suppose I mean I just I just hope that you I want to see more like the like the

334
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,160
demo with the chopping the vegetables thing now that was

335
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,160
unique are you looking forward to the next Nintendogs

336
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,560
if it's if it's like the DS one I

337
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,040
I really hope they expand on it they announce they announce 50 launch titles

338
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,800
for real 50 launch titles 20 of which are going to be

339
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
put out by Nintendo.

340
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Where did you get this?

341
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
I haven't heard of this.

342
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
I don't remember where I read that.

343
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:05,060
Well, then I have to take it with a grain of salt if you cannot cite a fact, of course.

344
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,440
But if that's the case, you will see these innovative things, but still though, the thing

345
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:15,000
about the revolution is they're trying to get away from Nintendo being looked at as

346
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,160
a kid's system, a system that's meant for little kids and that's it.

347
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:24,700
that's what Microsoft and Sony want you to believe is that the system is meant for younger

348
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
crowd when this is...

349
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,680
Well, something tells me this little game with the gun thing is going to dispel that

350
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
pretty quick.

351
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,760
Well, I don't know, but it just looks good.

352
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
That's all I got to say.

353
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,560
Besides, a Nintendo fanboy's answer to whenever a Microsoft or Sony fanboy presents them with

354
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,960
that is Resident Evil 4, which usually is a GameCube fanboy's answer to everything.

355
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,880
somebody tries to doggone into Resident Evil 4, bitch. Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 4,

356
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,320
bitch. That's great. I've said that exactly, actually. Have you really? I have. I think

357
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,360
everybody should use that in a sentence today. Challenge yourself to tell a friend, Resident

358
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:12,000
Evil 4, bitch. Snakes on a plane. Shut up. Snakes on a Resident Evil 4. Ah, anyway, if

359
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,040
you're a Nintendo DS fanboy, there's some good news in your future. The Nintendo DS

360
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,460
download stations are making their way around the country, you can actually locate one near

361
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:31,280
you on Nintendo.com and the Spring 2006 demo series has Mario Kart DS, Tetris DS, Meteos,

362
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:40,220
Metroid Prime Hunters, Pokemon Trozy, and it also has a preview of Brain Age, Train

363
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,880
Your Brain in Minutes a Day, that game, which I'm really looking forward to trying out.

364
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,140
Even if it does have Sudoku in it, which I'm a little tired of, I think the rest of it

365
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,140
will be pretty cool.

366
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,340
So I'm really looking forward to that.

367
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,740
So I want to try this demo, and True Swing Golf is also another demo in there.

368
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,160
Now, I did a quick search in our area, and it looks like GameCrazy is the chain that's

369
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
going to be carrying this a lot.

370
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,740
And GameCrazy is the one that's in Hollywood Video, right?

371
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,900
Some Hollywood Videos.

372
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,860
Some Hollywood Videos have them, but not all.

373
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,140
But the one nearest me has one, and they have a download station, supposedly.

374
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,780
Best Buys are also going to be a huge chain that has them.

375
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,960
again that's just in my area who knows where they are near you

376
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,440
head on over to nintendo.com slash ds download station all one word

377
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,960
to locate a ds download station near you

378
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,140
and all you gotta do you go into download play and they'll all come up right on

379
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,660
there and you choose what you want to download

380
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,340
and here's my tip I learned this at E3 when they did something similar

381
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,540
all you have to do close your ds put it in sleep mode

382
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,940
you can take the ds home with you as long as you don't turn it off demo is still there

383
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,300
Did that with the polarium demo last year for e3 Jesus why that game was awful

384
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,860
Sorry, I liked it enough to buy it

385
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:53,580
The only game I think I hated more than that was sprung. Otherwise, I thought polarium was a waste of my time

386
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,500
Even now now, what about ping pals? Oh, that's

387
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,700
That's not even a game that that just burns in hell

388
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,260
I gotta love that you gotta wonder if they were developing that game before I think so

389
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:12,040
I think that was before pictochat was announced and then then when pictochat was announced to be included. They were like, ah fuck

390
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
So that's why it's a bargain bin title now

391
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,620
Seriously, you probably find that game for like five dollars

392
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,900
It's not even worth that maybe 99 cents

393
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:30,240
Like if you can find that game at 99 cent clearance Center or the 98 cent store or whatever then maybe it might be worth

394
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,220
A look but otherwise that game is of the Dollar Tree special

395
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,220
Speaking of the DS, when do the pretty new ones come out, Loki?

396
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:45,220
Hopefully soon, and the estimated data is gonna be around the same time that, you know,

397
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,220
Mario, or the new Super Mario Brothers is coming out.

398
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,220
Anyways, according to the latest issue of EGM, they're reporting May.

399
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,220
And I think we reported May a while back to, I don't remember what the source was from,

400
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,220
but it looks like it's gonna be May.

401
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,660
I mean, it makes sense, it's right when this brand new game comes in and it would be a

402
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,740
really good packing game, so yeah, I think that's when it's going to happen sometime

403
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,740
mid-May.

404
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,480
Didn't we kind of talk about that last week, like theories were around on the internet

405
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,540
saying that it's possible that the DS Lite, well first Mario Brothers was pushed back,

406
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,060
but then I read that that was actually wrong, it got pushed back up.

407
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,060
It was a week.

408
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,060
They were kind of like...

409
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,060
They've been volleying back and forth.

410
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,060
Yeah.

411
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:33,740
been with the dates, but now it's back to the 15th, so we totally reported a false story

412
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:40,180
last week, our bad, but it's back now and maybe for the DS Lite to come out at the same

413
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,180
time.

414
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,540
They would have to announce that, that would have to be like a big surprise thing at E3,

415
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:49,380
like the DS Lite is coming out and it's on store shelves right now.

416
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,380
Is that feasible?

417
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,380
They could do that?

418
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,700
Pull a Sega Saturn?

419
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,700
They could.

420
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:01,060
I'm trying to think, yeah, that would actually be the Monday-Tuesday after E3, so yeah, that

421
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
makes sense.

422
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,060
There you go.

423
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:09,780
Alright, moving on, I've got a story for you guys in regards to Mario as well.

424
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:15,620
There's new postage stamps coming out in Japan that feature the Mario Brothers sprites, and

425
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:22,400
It's 80 yen to get a 10 stamp sheet, I'm sorry, no it's 80 yen is the value of the stamps

426
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,620
and there's 10 of them, so it would be 800 yen to get one of these sheets.

427
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:31,980
And there are stamps and they have things like the Cheep Cheeps, Mario, a Koopa, and

428
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,980
then that horrible, horrible sprite of the princess.

429
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,300
It always looked to me like the princess had a bucktooth in that sprite.

430
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,180
I don't know if it's just me, but that's always the way I saw it, it looked like she had funky

431
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,180
teeth.

432
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,100
She was like Princess White Trash, I don't know.

433
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,420
But check that out if you're in Japan, or if you're not in Japan, check out eBay because

434
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,780
I'm sure a lot of these are going to show up for collectors that want to get this stuff.

435
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,980
Super Mario Brothers stamps.

436
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:02,100
Also in Revolution News, Zookeeper is going to be coming out for the revolution.

437
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,100
Why?

438
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:08,140
This was from an interview in Nintendo Power, I believe, is where this is from.

439
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,420
And the article mentions that the game is also heading to the Xbox 360.

440
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,340
We're assuming the Xbox Arcade?

441
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,340
Yeah, probably.

442
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:21,300
Okay, first off, Zookeeper's already on the Xbox Live Arcade except it's called Bejeweled

443
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,900
or Jewel Quest.

444
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,260
Or Zuma, isn't it?

445
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,820
No, Zuma's totally different.

446
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,780
It's either Bejeweled or Jewel Quest, the game's already on there.

447
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,100
So it seems kind of pointless why they would take this on Xbox Live, however, this is why

448
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,900
I think this story is relevant, is that they say it's coming to the revolution.

449
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:43,840
I cannot fathom that they would release this game as a $39, $49 title.

450
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,000
And without some really frickin' incredible bells and whistles, this game is not worth

451
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
it.

452
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,280
Like, I'd rather see real animals falling down, not these tiles.

453
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,040
As a DS launch title, it was okay.

454
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
But for a revolution title...

455
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,520
It wasn't even a launch title, and it wasn't a very good title.

456
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,800
It's gonna be poopy.

457
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,360
However, what this makes me think, Nintendo Revolution's gonna have a service very similar

458
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
to Xbox Live Arcade.

459
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,600
Yeah, of course, everybody's gonna have a service just like that.

460
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,320
Well, I think this kind of just kind of confirms that, and I bet you these old classic titles

461
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,560
are probably fitting into that same scheme.

462
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,440
So not only are you going to be able to download classic titles, but probably these other games

463
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,000
as well, all on the revolution.

464
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,920
I couldn't cite you as a specific source, but I'm pretty sure Iwata-san said something

465
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,320
like that at a game developer's conference.

466
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
Oh, probably.

467
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,160
Yeah, he said something about, like, they were going to make titles that were going

468
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,880
to be distributed via the virtual conference.

469
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,840
And I thought I dreamt up this little theory all by myself.

470
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Oh well.

471
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Oh well.

472
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Rain on my parade.

473
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
See if I care.

474
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,720
Well anyways, zookeepers coming to both those systems and we do not care here at Orange

475
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Launch Radio.

476
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,500
Loki, I'm so glad we gave you this story tonight.

477
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,240
There's something going on in the Apple world, right?

478
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,880
Yeah, that's right.

479
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Well you know what?

480
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Gaming.

481
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,360
It's not really been a strong thing on the Apple

482
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,360
and now with the Intel chips and the Intel Macs out there.

483
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,440
Basically, Apple, their response to gaming on the Mac

484
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,920
is use Windows.

485
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,040
That's right, because the Mac is useless.

486
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,240
So you have to use Windows.

487
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,880
Anyway, so you can use this program called bootcamp.

488
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,480
They'll let you install Windows XP

489
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,320
without moving your Mac data.

490
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,760
and basically what it'll do is basically a dual boot

491
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,160
in the beginning and you can run Windows XP and it'll run a lot of stuff on there

492
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,240
that's for sure

493
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,460
a lot of games, I can't remember

494
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,660
basically saying

495
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,460
but just a lot of the major games out there right now so

496
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,240
definitely worth checking out if you want to play some games on a Mac

497
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,960
you know what you can already play World of Warcraft on a Mac

498
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,680
which is usually real games but not final fantasy no you can't no

499
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,720
so here here's the thing okay

500
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,280
first off

501
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:12,060
max do to do something on my i book i have made cds and dvds faster and

502
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,760
prettier than i have on the bc and all that other stuff like how to make a

503
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,520
cd prettier just with all the pretty stuff that apple makes for it to pretty

504
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,220
fire cds like done it

505
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,220
pretty sound I don't know I'm thinking more DVDs okay like pretty menus and

506
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,440
pretty things that I just could not do on the PC

507
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,680
they were just too weird for me you couldn't do

508
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,800
or PC couldn't do look shut up it doesn't matter

509
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,500
my point is my I love my Mac don't get mad at me

510
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,020
get mad at freaking Apple they're the ones saying use Windows so

511
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,340
you know that's that's not stupid that's smart

512
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,840
because now people are gonna go you mean I could do both on one system

513
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,600
that's smart good if you want to get a computer that's pretty

514
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,440
you know then that way you can run Windows and do stuff on Windows

515
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,440
and how is that not the perfect solution it's pretty and

516
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,760
it's pretty and it does everything you need to do you know

517
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,520
that's just like that's just stupid

518
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,580
okay but whatever okay if if you're really confident that Mac OS X or

519
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,720
whatever is great for you know doing your video and

520
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,380
audio or whatever and to be honest it's only better for print media

521
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,040
okay then great use your Mac

522
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,280
OS X for that and then use Windows for everything else

523
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,760
meanwhile I'll use Windows for everything because well it can do

524
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,120
everything that Mac OS X can so

525
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,200
there, you're a jerk

526
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,720
let's move on to another story and this is interesting we always love gaming and

527
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,960
politics stories

528
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,520
uh... there is a conservative political website out there

529
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,900
uh... that was actually defending gaming this week which i thought was very

530
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,220
interesting is national review dot com is the name of the site

531
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,060
and it makes a very interesting bullet points here uh... he kind of

532
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,460
this person who wrote this is adam

533
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,180
fear or

534
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,980
who wrote this story and made some interesting bullet points there

535
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,900
uh... of all the games that were reviewed by the e s r b in two thousand

536
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,820
five

537
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,860
less than thirteen percent were rated mature or adults only

538
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,940
Over 80 percent were either E or T.

539
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,700
Every important social indicator has been improving in recent years, even as

540
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,620
video game use among youths have increased.

541
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,300
Aggregate violent crime by juveniles fell 43 percent between

542
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,660
1995 and 2004.

543
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,540
A quick glance at the back of any game box provides parents with plenty of

544
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,980
information to make decisions for their families. With most new video games

545
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,460
costing between forty and sixty dollars, it's likely

546
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,640
that adults will need to be present when their kids purchase games so kind of

547
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,280
interesting they're coming from a conservative blog

548
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,860
which i don't know kind of is trying to set the stage that makes it look like

549
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,840
liberals are for these gaming restrictions and conservatives are

550
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,880
against them but i don't really believe that because

551
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,560
i live

552
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,440
traditionally vote usually liberal not a hundred percent time usually liberal

553
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,880
and uh... i certainly don't support it i think it's a lack of education on most

554
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,740
politicians and let's not forget to in order for these laws to pass most of the

555
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,020
time in the states and everything it's got to have bipartisan support because

556
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,420
usually you don't pass with just one side of the house but that's just my

557
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,740
wonder how many of these you know actual lawmakers out there are just bored out

558
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,700
of their mind and they just want to go home so they're gonna agree to whatever

559
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:37,140
you put in front of them no idea but yeah it's kind of it's like another one

560
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:46,140
of these bills, fine. Just do it. I want to go home and screw a hooker. That's what politicians

561
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,140
do.

562
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:52,940
Yeah, speaking of M-rated games in which you might be screwing hookers, Loki, there's some

563
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,300
interesting statistics out there this week on M-rated games?

564
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,860
Yes, because Harvard, you know, because they have nothing better to do than, you know,

565
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:05,660
polls and studies, they found out that an average M-rated game has 104 violent deaths

566
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:12,700
per hour. Not any of the games I play because there's way more than that, but in your average

567
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:19,760
game, you know, 104. And basically, you know, the report's conclusion was, parents and physicians

568
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,860
should recognize that the popular M-rated video games contain a wide range of unlabeled

569
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,860
content. No, actually, I think most of the content's labeled on the back there in that

570
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:34,520
little label that says M, and may expose children and adolescents to messages that may negatively

571
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,840
influence their perceptions attitudes and behaviors

572
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,600
uh... no

573
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,460
i think that it clearly says you know rated m for violence it doesn't say

574
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,540
rated m for

575
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,500
her for violent you know that's permitted me or our whatever

576
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,020
it's stupid only one hundred waste why are they wasting our money on doing

577
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,980
studies like this it means seriously

578
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,960
i could look at a game government that's pretty violent you know what the games

579
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,520
called i'm gonna kill your fucking mother you know i probably know you

580
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,760
probably can guess, hmm, it's pretty violent, you know, instead of, you know, Happy Puppy

581
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,520
Fun Time is not going to have, you know, freaking violent deaths in it. So, seriously, what's

582
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,200
the big deal? Why are they doing studies on this? It's like R-rated movies are bad, okay,

583
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,760
because they have R-rated content. Well, M-rated games are going to have bad content in them

584
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,560
as well, so it makes perfect sense.

585
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:29,600
Well, my thought is only 104? That's child's play. That's a low score. Haven't you ever

586
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,260
played Smash TV, do you know how many violent deaths occur in the scope of like two minutes

587
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:41,500
when I'm playing Smash TV? Like you tear through just people among people. Have they seen games

588
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,340
like Dynasty Warriors and 99 Nights and stuff like that? I mean, seriously, you're killing

589
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:51,820
thousands of people in like minutes. I would like to know what games were sampled. I mean,

590
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,660
I don't know and I don't really care. All I know is like, were you playing a game like,

591
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,120
I don't know like I hate to use this as an example but Driver 3

592
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,500
where like when I play I aim for the people and that's how I play Driver 3

593
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:04,740
I

594
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,180
purposely try to run over as many people as I can. Shouldn't it be like trying to find a cure for cancer or something other

595
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,620
than doing you know stupid

596
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,940
research like this? I mean what's this actually proof? Wow we knew what we already knew.

597
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,260
Great. Give me my A. You know seriously.

598
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:24,260
I don't know. That's great. I'm going over to the chat room www.orangelaunchradio.com

599
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,460
click on chat. I think this is very funny.

600
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:33,620
Dark Tetsuya was responding to all the informations on the back of the box thing from the conservative

601
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,380
blog and he says, yeah, but parents would actually have to check the back of the box.

602
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,180
Oh, that's right.

603
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:45,040
All the effort to rotate the box, why was I even thinking that, because parents don't

604
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,320
have that kind of energy, let alone to watch kids and monitor what they do.

605
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
This is what I think is great.

606
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,860
Can I tell a story about my childhood and my mother from my childhood?

607
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,860
Go ahead.

608
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,860
Okay, here we go.

609
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,020
When I was a kid, my mom would spend like literally an hour at the video store reading

610
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,380
the back of every single box of every movie that's new that week, right?

611
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,860
She's in the store, she's going, do I want to rent this one?

612
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,860
Or do I want to rent the, oh this one sounds violent, I don't know if I want to get that

613
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,860
one.

614
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:14,020
Or this might be, you know, she'll spend like an hour reading the back of every box.

615
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,460
And then like I'll, you know, take a game that I want to rent, I'll walk up to her and

616
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,980
I'll be like, can I rent this?

617
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,980
And she'll ask me, what's it about?

618
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,440
It's about fun.

619
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,240
Puppies I

620
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,400
Mean, I can I rent Mortal Kombat 2. What's it about?

621
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
People playing together

622
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,600
Okay, I mean seriously yet in the same score

623
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,360
I mean, I love my mom to give me in the same

624
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,680
So she would spend like an hour reading the back of all the movie boxes and you know

625
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
She'd have to ask me what the game's about

626
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,440
You know, I was thinking like games like Smash TV

627
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,380
How many people you think you get you kill in that game, you know in an average minute?

628
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:58,960
it. Probably about 104. Probably in a minute. I go more like 300. Are you playing two player

629
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,200
or one player? Yeah, it depends. And somebody in the chat room, Dark Knight mentioned the

630
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,240
sequel Total Carnage, which is probably twice as bad. Exactly, and here's another thing

631
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,520
too. If you're counting violent deaths, say I'm playing a Star Wars game or something

632
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,520
like that and I destroy, you know, like the Death Star or something. How many millions

633
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,320
of people are in the death star I mean that's really gonna throw the

634
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:29,840
statistic you know out there so I don't know does the AT-ST account for 30

635
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,040
deaths I think that's a good question and it should if it doesn't oh I'm so

636
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,680
glad to know I'm not alone Fireoboma in our chat room says that's the exact same

637
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:45,840
thing my parents did Skye so I'm not alone in the world good to know moving

638
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:21,780
to show that there is violence, nudity or whatever else is in the game because it doesn't

639
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,940
go into as much details as you might have thought.

640
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,520
Kimberly Thompson was the study's author and she is concerned that parents might take

641
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,820
this as a sign that the game is just peachy for kids saying that parents should not interpret

642
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:39,720
the absence of a content descriptor to mean the absence of content.

643
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,980
The study found that 80% of M-rated games included sex, violence, profanity, gambling

644
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,140
or drug and alcohol use, none of which was described on the labels.

645
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:53,700
This was ran by Reuters. You know, Super Mario Bros. 3 contains gambling as well

646
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,220
because you can yell... It's true.

647
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,140
You know, get your power-ups, you have to match them, and that's like a slot machine.

648
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,060
Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit? I don't...

649
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,940
I mean, come on, why wasn't that rated M?

650
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,580
Um, you know, here's another thing too. I was wondering, maybe we should

651
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:14,260
change our ranking system to NP for mature rated games, not PG for kids.

652
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,060
I like that better.

653
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,480
Seriously, what do we need to have?

654
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,720
Like a person's decapitated head, you know, that says,

655
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,040
this may contain violence.

656
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,360
Well, I didn't know.

657
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,120
I couldn't tell that the decapitated head

658
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
meant violence.

659
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,760
I didn't know.

660
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,680
Maybe that's what we need to do is

661
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,480
start putting little pictures on the thing.

662
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,560
Like, you know, a little decapitated head may contain

663
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,120
violence.

664
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,240
A pair of titties may contain nudity.

665
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,440
Like, just write fuck on the box, you know,

666
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,400
might contain profanity.

667
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,400
Can you imagine what the cover of Grand Theft Auto would look like?

668
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,400
You know what I'm gonna say.

669
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,400
Seriously though, this is why we have to put on like, you know, spray paint bottles, do not eat.

670
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:59,400
I mean, just because people out there are that fucking retarded that they can't figure this stuff out.

671
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Seriously, if you're that dumb, you know, that you can't understand what the words mean,

672
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,400
maybe you shouldn't be playing games, maybe you should learn how to read instead.

673
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,720
Fireboma would like to point out that Kingdom Hearts 2 has blood in it, maybe it should

674
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,280
be rated M for Slash.

675
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,360
Dark Knight is suggesting some other family friendly games that parents could buy here.

676
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:26,800
Mary-Kate and Ashley get a clue, that might be a good one for parents to play, that would

677
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
be really good.

678
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,760
And then of course now they're talking about Super Mario Brothers hacks because somebody

679
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,680
said Super Titty Brothers which I guess was really a hack that was out there and now they're

680
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,720
talking about all the other hacks super porno brothers out there lame everybody

681
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,640
and their mother did a Super Mario Brothers hack speaking of hacks we have

682
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,600
a story on our old buddy Jackie poo right Loki yes Jackie poo and his modest

683
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:56,960
proposal a modest proposal part two basically he I don't know what he has

684
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,280
against joystick and why he's reading so much of this website because they'll

685
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,680
report on him I guess you know but anyways he says hey how about a video

686
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,080
game depicting killing of people who run joystick better I bet they'd be real

687
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:18,360
interested in doing something about a certain game then maybe they would feel

688
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,720
how cops and women feel about Grand Theft Auto oh but that would require

689
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,440
some actual thought and I forgot you're all gamers so joystick is running them

690
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,800
contest now to design a game and stuff and it's to be honest it's real stupid

691
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,480
and yes joystick I love that response joysticks response is to run a contest

692
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,480
encouraging the deaths of joystick bloggers horrifically and the best one

693
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,440
will win a prize or whatever it is I mean that's great I don't understand

694
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,080
what this guy's problem is I mean seriously why is he going out to gaming

695
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:54,960
blogs I mean that's like because thousands of people rejoicing I rejoiced

696
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:01,960
you read joystick, you read joystick, you spike your joystick, that's 3 out of 3 right there, 100% of gamers read joystick

697
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,960
100% of us don't care what he says either

698
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,960
I know

699
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,960
I mean, doesn't he understand that that's

700
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,960
See, did you like how I ran that study? That's what other people do

701
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,960
I said 100% of gamers read joystick, because we all do, so that's 100%

702
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:21,960
You know, that should be our new tagline, 100% of gamers listen to Orange Lounge Radio

703
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,960
Wouldn't that be great?

704
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:35,960
You know, I'm sorry, but Jackie Pooh needs to seriously, he needs to do something. He needs to get a hobby.

705
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:42,960
And cause this whole, you know, holy crusade that he's going on is just ridiculous.

706
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,960
I mean, he's like the freaking Batman of the legal world.

707
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:55,520
I mean he will not stop until he gets revenge with the people who killed people because

708
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,720
they played Grand Theft Auto or something.

709
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,160
Raven's Dolphin in chat says Orange Lounge Radio is next for Jack.

710
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,160
Look out.

711
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,160
You know what?

712
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,980
Hey, here it is right there on the table.

713
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:10,260
If Jackie Poo wants to come on this show and have a professional interview, as long as

714
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,120
he's prepared to answer the difficult questions, because we don't BS around, I will treat him

715
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,900
with respect and dignity at least for those few minutes that we're having the

716
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,640
interview he is welcome to come on the program and I'll give him a fair shot to

717
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,580
explain his case to gamers but you know what if he starts making fun of us and

718
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:29,840
saying gamers are you know they're all losers and have no life I'm gonna bring

719
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:36,180
it right back okay but I am I'm willing to stick out the olive branch if he will

720
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,020
treat us with respect I will treat him with respect and invite him on this

721
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,240
program for a once-in-a-lifetime chance interview with the esteemed host of

722
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,240
Orange Lawn for you.

723
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,240
It's like, seriously, how old is he?

724
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,360
I mean, he's resorting to name calling.

725
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:55,760
I mean, God, get out of the elementary school, you know, frame of mind here, you know, conduct

726
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,080
yourself like a lawyer and not like a little kid.

727
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,880
Okay, here's the deal, VX JasonXV says in chat, Sky, what happens if he doesn't show

728
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,740
you the same amount of respect?

729
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,300
Then I will do the complete opposite of what I teach to people every day.

730
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,740
I teach customer service for a living and I tell people, take the high road.

731
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,580
No matter what the customers do to you, you take the high road.

732
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,980
However, in this regard, if he takes the low road, I'm going to be right there with him.

733
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:19,980
I'm going to get ghetto.

734
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:20,980
Okay?

735
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,260
Just call me the fucking limbo master because I can go lower than he can.

736
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,260
Exactly.

737
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,340
Anyway, now of course the chat room is trying to start a fight there.

738
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,340
Send him an email.

739
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,340
Tell him I said hugs and kisses.

740
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,380
Hey, we contributed to those flowers.

741
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,380
He's just so stupid.

742
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,540
He's getting way too much attention.

743
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,780
Seriously, he's like a little spoiled brat kid.

744
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:46,900
What else is the gaming community doing in response to Jack's latest tirades and such?

745
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:52,740
Well, they are wiping their ass with his name, literally.

746
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,740
That's mature.

747
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:59,900
Yes, in fact, if you want to buy some Jack Thompson toilet paper, they have it available

748
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,900
on jinx.com.

749
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,020
It's only $5.95 for a roll.

750
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,300
The question is, is it two ply or one ply?

751
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,980
That's a lot for a roll of toilet paper.

752
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,540
I mean, you know how, $5.95 at Target will get you like a 12 pack at least of toilet

753
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,540
paper.

754
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:20,100
That's not a lot of ass to wipe there with the Jack Thompson toilet paper for $5.95.

755
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:24,600
But every time you used the bathroom, you'd come out smiling.

756
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,600
That's worth something.

757
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,600
Maybe I already do that.

758
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,340
You know what, in case if that's not enough, they also have RIAA toilet paper too, so.

759
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,340
Oh goody!

760
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:38,380
get a discount if I order them both I don't know I don't condone buying this

761
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,380
because it looks like singleply and not very comfortable and our chat room is

762
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:48,340
making all sorts of sophomoric comments I'm not gonna read out loud because and

763
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:54,380
out first grade humor level but it is really we're not it's really I'm not

764
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:58,380
supposed to encourage it any further it's really funny though so if you're

765
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,300
not in chat right now while you're missing out all right you know that

766
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:06,300
talking about our old buddy Jackie poo always puts us in a mood right Loki yes

767
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:12,300
a mood so we have to get moody here and get a little angsty and give out our F

768
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,540
use of the week

769
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:28,500
Yes, it's time for the FUs of the week.

770
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,500
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight, since Dark Sakura is absent.

771
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,900
FU to whatever made Jamie sick!

772
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:40,020
Yes, and fuck you to my old- I know this is typical of laptops, but my freakin', like,

773
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:45,500
crotch is on fire from this stupid laptop, because this thing is so damn hot, it's just

774
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,060
not even funny

775
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,420
could somebody please wiki quote that my crotch is on fire from this laptop

776
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,500
that would be awesome thank you

777
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,500
they're gonna take me down to my page anyways

778
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,100
your wiki quote thing got queued for deletion didn't it

779
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,220
yeah it's because somebody out there is bitter

780
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,720
it's not me i didn't do it yes i know it wasn't you

781
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,140
save the wiki quote page actually somebody suggested to move it to an orange lounge radio

782
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:09,740
wiki quote page and i like that idea because i want to get quoted once in a while too

783
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,300
i say some pretty profound things in the show once in a while

784
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,300
don't i?

785
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,300
don't i?

786
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:18,380
yes okay but um save the wiki quote all right anyway

787
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:23,020
yeah that typical fuck you the slow drivers because they're out there they're out there

788
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:27,660
in numbers it seems like every time i'm trying to go someplace you know and get there in a timely

789
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,980
matter there's always someone that has to drive 30 miles an hour while you know sticking their

790
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,500
hand out the window protein it's like a fucking wing or something that they're flying a plane

791
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:41,500
with their hand i'm like fucking drive instead of playing with your goddamn arm so you know that's

792
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:48,500
Alright, Spike, do you have any FUs you want to give out, or are you in a good, happy,

793
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,900
huggy, tree-hugging mood?

794
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,620
The only FU that I can really think of is it's really minor.

795
00:49:54,620 --> 00:50:01,580
I'm really bothered by the edits that Square Enix made to Kingdom Hearts 2 for a US release,

796
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:05,400
and they were talking in the chatroom about it, and you know, it's not really a big deal,

797
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,300
and that's absolutely correct.

798
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:15,480
But it still seems pointless to me to change guns to not look so realistic in Kingdom Hearts.

799
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,780
Do that because Kingdom Hearts they think is more of a kid's game because of the Disney

800
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,780
element?

801
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,780
I would expect so.

802
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:25,480
I read on, I think it was Kotaku, but don't quote me on that, that it actually helped

803
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:34,160
them to get a younger rating by changing the guns to look more cartoony, but it bothers

804
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:40,160
me that such a little thing could make such a big difference, you know? We can't, like,

805
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:46,480
stop, you know, 187 from, you know, people killing people, but Kingdom Hearts better

806
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:52,760
take out that gun, or they're gonna have a higher rating. That's ridiculous! Agreed.

807
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,560
Pointless edits. At least release a more adult version as well, or something. I don't know.

808
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,600
Humor me. Make me able to order it off your website or something if you don't want to

809
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,500
be that many copies but but it isn't a big deal so it's not really an f you

810
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:11,700
it's more of a screw-off but like buzz off bugger off bugger off all right my

811
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:16,260
f you goes to Konami this week and I realized that this show you know like if

812
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:21,380
it weren't for DDR we probably be doing this show but I'm seriously Konami fuck

813
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,660
you this week you know why because you are also in the business of making slot

814
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:31,360
machines and those slot machines stole $60 for me at the casino the other night

815
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:36,960
so F you you makers of one-armed bandits that steal my money and don't give me

816
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:44,200
any back although I could definitely go for a Suikoden slot machine yeah how

817
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,800
about a rumble roses slot machine you know what maybe maybe that's a future

818
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,400
list list we need to do a slot machine we'd like to see Konami make this Konami

819
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,160
do the fortune cookie one that one is hilarious it's the most racist slot

820
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,280
machine I've ever seen the fortune cookie and like you play it and if you

821
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,760
get all the fortune cookies then the guy who runs the you know Chinese restaurant

822
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,760
comes up and goes this is mr. lucky's Chinese I'm like it's the most racist

823
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,960
thing I've ever seen in my life one of them and I'm just like is that Konami

824
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,400
that made that I don't know oh no if you win on my money I have no money to buy

825
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,760
rice it's horrible it's horrible I'm saying I'm not making this up go to a

826
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,960
casino if you're over 18 21 whatever the age is in your state go to a casino and

827
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,120
check out that fortune cookie machine it's it's been like actually play it for

828
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:36,480
a little bit it's bad anyway moving on Loki there is a sequel being made

829
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:43,480
finally after many failed attempts all a game that I love exactly pilot wings it

830
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:49,400
makes sense they're gonna put one on the revolution but that's basically rumored

831
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:57,280
according to EGM on the latest issue. They had it in their rumors section, so it makes

832
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,460
sense. I would think so, especially with the remote, the rev-mote or whatever and the way

833
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,440
you would be able to use that in the game. It sounds like it would be gimmicky enough

834
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:11,000
to where they would do that. Besides, they have like how many first party games coming

835
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,020
out, you know, lots of them. So you gotta have a Mario Brothers game, you gotta have

836
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,840
have a Zelda game which you know you sort of have Twilight Princess I guess

837
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:23,180
that kind of counts you know and you would have maybe a Smash Brothers and

838
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:29,620
maybe Metroid and pilot wings trying to think what else

839
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:34,140
Pokemon? Pokemon beatdown! I still have a hard time believing that all these games

840
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,460
are gonna be out at launch unless you mean by at launch like the first six

841
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:42,100
months that I would believe but 50 games like the week the system comes out hell

842
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:47,460
know hell no why do you think that if anything the first party games will be

843
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:51,900
there cuz obviously they've been working on those the longest if Nintendo has 20

844
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,500
first party games out on launch day I will do something crazy give me

845
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:01,580
something to do I will do it well let me see I can't afford it all I can't

846
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:07,460
remember is 20 20 games or 20 percent of the 50 game oh that's so yeah that's a

847
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,780
little bit now we're changing our story aren't we a little bit I remember the

848
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:16,960
number 50 50 games but 20% of them how about $50 for 20 games that will be

849
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,900
available in the first month I think that's more realistic I don't know let

850
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:27,060
we'll just see it at e3 I guess so I'm seeing if the chat room has any

851
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:31,980
suggestions on what I could do like as a dare if they do if they release 20 games

852
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:41,560
at launch let's see rub myself in $340 worth of puddin says DJ poo eater how

853
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:47,100
about this maybe I won't go for $340 however if Nintendo puts out 20 games on

854
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,940
the launch day has to be on the day otherwise it doesn't count if Nintendo

855
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:56,100
puts out 20 days I will get a six-pack of those jello puddin things and rub it

856
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:01,820
all over myself live on air can we yeah should we take photos awesome take video

857
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,780
All right, you can do it you do a video and put it on a lot of our PS PS account

858
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:09,780
But remember Nintendo has to release 20 games on the launch day and it's not gonna happen

859
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,580
So I can feel comfortable saying that

860
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,180
All right

861
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:20,780
To which our chat room is having a little bit of a scary scary thought there. What did dark Tetsuya have a better idea?

862
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:29,180
What is it would you say spike in the chat room Oh dark Tetsuya asks, will you go straight if I would go straight?

863
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:34,500
You know, I think the person I'm seeing will have a big problem with that if I went straight suddenly over a stupid bet

864
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,260
So I think he'd laugh. I can't promise you 50 jello shots

865
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,860
I'll die

866
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:48,340
No, we'll do it we'll do a pudding we'll do Rob's put an adventure and put it on our PSP if remember

867
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,820
It's got to be 20 games

868
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,820
19 doesn't work

869
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,100
21 maybe I'll get seven

870
00:55:54,100 --> 00:56:01,100
10 packs that rub them all over me. Well wouldn't 20% of 50 be 10 anyways? I'll even do tapioca.

871
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:11,100
What? Wouldn't 20% of 50 be 10 anyways? Yeah. So how about 10 games? It would make for compelling

872
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:16,700
radio. I don't know. See, 10 might be realistic to me. How many did they have on GameCube

873
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:22,460
at launch? They only had like 4 or 5. On the day the system came out, they only had a few.

874
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:26,440
No, I'm only gonna do 20 cuz I would talk to Jamie. Maybe she'll do it for 10

875
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,960
But I only end of 64. They only have three. I mean three games. I won't I won't do it for 10. Not that yeah

876
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,800
I didn't know I with the video going on all our PSP dot-com and every that's too embarrassing. I can't take that risk

877
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,000
Okay, but what I know 20 is not gonna happen

878
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,920
Moving on oh

879
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,520
This is great radio tonight Jamie's not here to keep us in line. So we're being naughty. Um

880
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,900
Um, Xbox 360 got a new demo this week.

881
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,120
It's the demo for Tomb Raider Legend.

882
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:01,680
It hit the store and it was on Tuesday, April 4th is when that demo went to the store.

883
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,680
The marketplace.

884
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,840
I keep saying the store, but the marketplace.

885
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,260
I actually went and I downloaded it and it sucked.

886
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,360
I didn't like it at all.

887
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,960
It's pretty, but not pretty enough.

888
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,160
I thought the frame rate was not where it should be for a next gen system.

889
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,880
I felt the gameplay feels about ten years old like an old Tomb Raider game

890
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,820
and I was bored and I didn't even finish the demo. I thought it was

891
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,920
craptacular.

892
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,720
Didn't like it.

893
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,820
Not gonna buy the game.

894
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,680
And I thought the controls were crap too.

895
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,920
It doesn't feel fluid to me.

896
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,200
Unless

897
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,360
something big changes between this demo and the final release

898
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,800
I am no way interested in Tomb Raider Legends.

899
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,540
I watched someone play the game and I did like some of the details that they

900
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:48,860
hadn't, like the water effects look pretty cool. I thought the water effects were crap! Did you get to a point where you were like

901
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:52,460
behind the waterfall and the camera would get behind the waterfall? It looked like crap.

902
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,860
It looked like a bunch of snow, like white snow on the screen. No, I didn't see that. But anyways,

903
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:00,440
I did like the smoke coming out of the guns, even though it looked kind of blocky,

904
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,340
but still kind of neat, and

905
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:09,100
the voice acting, I guess, was okay, but I don't like Tomb Raider, period, and so

906
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,180
the last Tomb Raider game I played was Tomb Raider 2, and even that, I missed Tomb

907
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:16,860
Raider 2 playing this demo. I'm sorry I just really didn't like this game. To be honest

908
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:24,240
Tomb Raider is like less tomb raiding and more I don't know what. And in this game I

909
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,120
think it's a lot of flashbacks. I mean they've been doing this thing with the last few games.

910
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:32,780
Let's just flashback to different times. Didn't they like kill her off in one of them? I mean

911
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:38,420
seriously so all these games have to be flashbacks now because they've killed her off. I don't

912
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:44,020
Gizm in our chat room says Baa on the Tomb Raider hate I like the demo hate to

913
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,820
each their own I'm sure there's people to disagree with me in fact I know there

914
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,820
are in reading some websites and things there's people that disagree with me I

915
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:54,260
didn't like it I just didn't get what the big deal is didn't sell me on it

916
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:58,940
sorry maybe it's just not my kind of game I don't know I'm not I'm not huge on

917
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:03,180
the platformers anymore like I used to like like crash bandicoot and Spyro and

918
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:07,140
those type of games but I don't know how huge it but that's not true because like

919
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:10,260
Mario I still like and those types of things so I don't I don't know what

920
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:17,980
Tomb Raider's problem is but it just I didn't like it sorry moving on to

921
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:24,620
another story Loki lots of stuff going on with oblivion this week right lots of

922
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:30,380
controversy and things yeah lots of stuff is more like it they had this

923
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:34,540
stupid I don't even know why the hell anyone buy this but they had the stupid

924
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:39,260
thing that they put on the marketplace. It's a horse armor pack. And I remember talking

925
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:44,580
about this a while back when they announced this. And it's basically, just like it sounds,

926
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:51,000
horse armor. But it's not different stats or anything, right? I guess your horse is

927
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,060
armored now, a little bit. Here's the thing. It costs you money, first off, 200 Microsoft

928
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:02,660
points, which is I think about 3 bucks, and you have to buy the armor in the game. You

929
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:07,700
don't just get the armor it just makes it available for purchase so oh see you

930
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:10,260
don't even get the armored on your horse automatically you still have to work for

931
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:16,060
it in the game yeah that's crappy and to be honest it looks stupid all right so

932
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:23,540
basically I'm paying two dollars for a graphic file that's probably you know

933
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,120
400 pixels by 400 pixels that's gonna be laid around my horse and they in a

934
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:34,160
shapely way that's what I'm paying for well I'm paying for a sprite you're not

935
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,560
paying for a sprite you're paying for a polygon model though sorry but still

936
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:44,160
yeah and see the same difference um I don't know I think it's stupid then

937
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,960
again I know enough people obsessed with oblivion that they're probably excited

938
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:52,120
about this I wouldn't buy it I'm not buying it and tell you why because one

939
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:57,360
One, it looks stupid, two, there's no need to have horse armor anyways.

940
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,180
You don't have to ride a horse from town to town because you can automatically travel

941
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:02,180
from town to town.

942
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:06,720
Just go, okay, I want to go to this town, boop, load, there, you're at the town.

943
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:12,280
I mean, you don't have to ride a horse anywhere, it's not required, so who cares?

944
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,000
And besides, I heard there's a part in the game where you can actually get a horse that

945
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,600
is armored or like undead or something and it basically can't be hurt anyways.

946
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:25,240
so what's the point in getting horse armor? Anyways.

947
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,880
You know what though, for all of this common sense...

948
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,400
And you're not going to show it to any of your friends anyways, because the game's not

949
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:34,560
on live, so... who cares? For all of this common sense though, there

950
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:39,200
was, I saw on LiveJournal at least, at least 20 people who had talked about purchasing

951
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:46,200
this pack as a positive thing, as buying upgrades for so small amounts of money being a good

952
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,400
thing in the direction that gaming is going. Well the next download that they have, when

953
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,700
I'm not too proud of this either. They're having a patch, they're going to fix all the

954
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:57,280
infinite money glitches, which sucks, and I personally think they should leave those

955
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,240
in there because I like cheating, and they're going to add new quests though, but you still

956
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,240
got to pay for that.

957
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,100
Yeah, here's the deal. If you don't like it, don't buy it, and then they won't try to sell

958
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:11,920
it anymore. I don't like it because I don't get Halo, well, it's tough, because Halo was

959
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,800
even weirder because the maps were free, but you could buy them three months in advance

960
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,880
for so much amount of money. That was always kind of weird to me too. But a lot of things

961
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:27,220
on the original Xbox, you would be free. Like additional maps and things on different games

962
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:33,160
and costumes and things. The only things that I remember paying for would be songs and DDR,

963
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:39,040
which to me is a little different because you're really adding to the game by getting

964
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:43,960
brand new songs to play and step charts and everything. Maybe people would disagree with

965
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,960
me and say that's the place.

966
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:50,800
What they did for this is because cameo they have the new costume things and that's what they charge for their costume

967
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,200
So they took it as an example to charge that for it

968
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Well, that's kind of crappy too

969
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:01,840
Cameos retarded in the fact that you can download costumes that do nothing other than reskin the character

970
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,480
But you can dress like killer instinct characters

971
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,400
Who

972
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,120
cares

973
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:16,040
Who cares that doesn't make cameo better including nothing would like or get better. Yes

974
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,160
Well, that's kind of cool, but I still not gonna pay for that

975
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,080
I'm not gonna pay for that

976
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,920
Horse armor

977
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,360
Seriously, I don't know

978
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:33,520
Why would you need horse armor? Anyways, I have hard enough time killing somebody. That's a human let alone a horse

979
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:42,080
worse. What else have they modded in Oblivion lately? Other things that they've modded in

980
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:49,920
Oblivion. Well, like most things that have to do with the PC, they have released the

981
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:58,000
topless mod. That's right, your Oblivion characters, or female characters, can go wild. And they

982
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,240
They have this patch out there, apparently all they've done is removed the clothing.

983
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:08,700
This skin was already in there, so I guess you can kind of almost say, oh noes!

984
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:12,520
It's you know, hot coffee mod type thing, without sex.

985
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:19,480
But yeah, pretty much there's really nasty, ugly people, because of course any character

986
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,400
you generate with the character generator is ugly, that are naked.

987
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,800
So really nasty, ugly, naked people.

988
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,800
Enjoy

989
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:32,640
Why is it whenever there's a game that comes out somebody finds out a way to make the lead character naked

990
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:37,580
I mean always without fail you want to hear something funny. This is a great story. I don't know

991
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,120
This is about Tomb Raider. Okay, and about how it might be delayed

992
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:47,540
Apparently and this is way here. There is a certain scene in the game where

993
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:53,380
I'm not sure if it's Laura Croft or if it's one of the other like sub characters that's in there

994
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:59,460
Um, they're wearing these like evening gowns or whatever and apparently the way the physics

995
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:06,100
in the game work, certain characters pop out during the game and that would be a bad thing

996
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:10,460
being that this game is almost gold and the fact that I think it's rated teen if I remember

997
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,340
correctly.

998
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,060
So popping out would not be good.

999
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:17,460
Uh, Gissom says OMG I need the PC version now.

1000
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,460
Fap fap fap.

1001
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:22,460
laser123454321 says girls gone wild in oblivion

1002
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:26,540
fireboma says you can be like that guy who is wanking off to world of warcraft

1003
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:30,260
oblivion I think it's great that they have a PC mod thing so you can actually

1004
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:30,940
mod

1005
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,620
PC versions but that's another thing too is then why would I want to buy the

1006
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:36,460
horse armor mod for the PC

1007
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:40,540
if I can just mod it for free

1008
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:46,980
alright moving on we're gonna go to another story here and it's

1009
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:57,980
actually a contest that's right we are giving away some prize packs from 24 the

1010
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:03,220
game we were kind enough to get passed along some prize packs for 24 the game

Jack24 at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1020
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,940
And if you've been watching the show 24 this season,

1021
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:36,020
you know that the body count

1022
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,300
has been through the roof this season.

1023
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,980
It's almost annoying how many people have died,

1024
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,860
like tons of people's favorites have died.

1025
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:45,580
All you have to do, do a little research, and hopefully you're a fan of the show and

1026
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:51,500
you already know, tell me any two people that have died this season, any two people that

1027
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:55,980
have died this season on the show, and that will qualify you to win the 24 prize pack,

1028
01:06:55,980 --> 01:07:01,100
copy of the game, CTU t-shirt or you don't know Jack t-shirt, 24 mouse pad, 24 coffee

1029
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,900
mug, and a 24 keychain.

1030
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,260
That's Jack24 at OrangeOnTrader.com.

1031
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:08,580
Any two people that have died in season five of 24.

1032
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:11,500
Random extra number one and random extra number two, that doesn't count.

1033
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,360
You have to give me names of like actual characters, okay?

1034
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,200
Main characters.

1035
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,780
Or even supplemental characters will work,

1036
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:20,360
because main characters is a little vague.

1037
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,000
So it's gotta be somebody that has a name.

1038
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:23,840
Let's put it that way.

1039
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,760
So random extra, like if you saw the episode

1040
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,900
where people were dropping like flies at CTU,

1041
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,860
then work, unless you can name me specific people

1042
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:31,420
that were involved in that.

1043
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:32,260
Good luck.

1044
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,080
Excellent.

1045
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:33,920
Good luck.

1046
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,380
By the way, in segment B, we're gonna give away

1047
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:39,020
an Amped 3 prize pack, so stay tuned.

1048
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:40,140
It's awesome.

1049
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,260
It's a great game.

1050
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:45,340
Alright, moving on, let's go to another story.

1051
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:50,300
We have an open letter from Sony Online Entertainment to PC Gamer Magazine.

1052
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,780
This was kind of interesting.

1053
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:55,340
Sony Online Entertainment actually wrote to the magazine.

1054
01:07:55,340 --> 01:08:00,520
You may remember that PC Gamer Magazine said they were no longer going to accept ads from

1055
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:04,100
Gil sellers and gold sellers and other types of currency sellers.

1056
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,720
They were not going to put this in their magazine.

1057
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:10,260
And Sony Online Entertainment wrote this letter and Joystick is actually where I got a copy

1058
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,260
of this letter from.

1059
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:12,620
You can check it out over there.

1060
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:18,080
In this letter, they were saying that these companies that sell these and the farmers

1061
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,460
that usually accompany their services have been as much of an issue for our company as

1062
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:24,520
they are for your readers, the people who play online games.

1063
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:28,440
Over the last few years, the problems associated with the secondary market have impacted Sony

1064
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:32,660
Online Entertainment greatly, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, gold farmers are evil, blah,

1065
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,860
blah, blah, blah, blah.

1066
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:37,640
But this is the part of the letter I think that's interesting.

1067
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:42,960
We have taken substantial steps towards solving these and other problems, as well as balancing

1068
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:48,380
the desires of those who wish to engage in legitimate real money transactions by launching

1069
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:51,000
station exchange in EverQuest 2.

1070
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,160
We will continue to develop innovative solutions in the future."

1071
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:59,760
So in other words what they're saying is that selling things for money is bad unless

1072
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:03,000
it's us doing it, right?

1073
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
It's bad, okay?

1074
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,860
As long as we get a cut, it's good.

1075
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:15,260
Does anything strike somebody funny there about that?

1076
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,100
Isn't there a weird inconsistency there?

1077
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:20,980
I mean, couldn't they have just left that part out in their little letter, the little

1078
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:24,020
plug for their service for selling things for who?

1079
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,020
Yeah, I think so.

1080
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,020
Yeah.

1081
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,300
I don't know.

1082
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,900
Just my thought.

1083
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,900
Questions on the 24 contest coming from the chat room.

1084
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:35,300
Firebooma asks, does it have to be from this season?

1085
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:44,860
Yes, they have to be from season 5 for the 24th contest, jack24 at ownersonstrator.com.

1086
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:50,220
News story, Loki, IGN, what did they report this week?

1087
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:56,180
Reported stuff that I reported weeks ago, basically saying that Tony Hawk's Downhill

1088
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:58,540
Jam is going to be a Revolution launch title.

1089
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:05,500
I reported this back when we had the activation, or not the activation, the Activision list

1090
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:09,620
from the PlayStation, or Destination PlayStation event.

1091
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:17,280
So blow me IGN, I reported that weeks ago, where were you?

1092
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,460
Maybe you're the source, or something, I don't know.

1093
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:23,720
Well, it'd be surprising to me since they didn't mention the source, so yeah, it could

1094
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,720
possibly be.

1095
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:35,360
But hey, what do you expect, another launch game, Tony Hawk, cool.

1096
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:40,820
One more story for you guys, this segment of the program and it has to do with, who

1097
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,720
doesn't love Bob Ross?

1098
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:47,640
I love Bob Ross, I remember Bob Ross from when I was a kid, I mean who doesn't love

1099
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,560
a white man with an afro, come on, unless he's Napoleon Dynamite.

1100
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,940
Bob Ross was awesome.

1101
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:59,420
Bob Ross was totally awesome and Bob Ross is actually getting his own video game and

1102
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:01,800
far too late if you ask me.

1103
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:06,220
Many people said, �This is an April Fool�s joke, you people are full of shit.� No,

1104
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,680
they are not full of shit.

1105
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,180
This was not an April Fool�s joke.

1106
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:14,980
IGN is funny enough where we are getting this story from, they actually contacted these

1107
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:22,280
folks directly at the Bob Ross Foundation, I believe it�s called, whoever owns the

1108
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:27,400
rights to him now. They contacted him and they said the press release is not a joke,

1109
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,360
but the side effect of people thinking it might help us get noticed. But they really

1110
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:36,100
are going to make a game for the DS and the revolution to teach you how to paint your

1111
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:41,940
own happy little trees. I am so excited. I can't draw for shit, but I will pick up these

1112
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:48,660
games. Why don't they release this for the PC too? I mean, using a stylus or something?

1113
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:52,200
tablet things, because I know Jamie bought one of those, and she paid good money for

1114
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:57,120
those tablets, and I don't think enough people own those, but I think it's a good idea, but

1115
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,520
yeah, who knows?

1116
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,860
My question is, is this the next logical evolution of a Mario Paint type game?

1117
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,860
That's a very good question.

1118
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:12,980
I mean, we haven't seen Mario Paint on any system lately, and I'm kind of surprised we

1119
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:15,160
haven't seen it on the DS yet.

1120
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:20,640
Mario Paint seemed like a totally logical idea for the DS especially with the whole dual screen thing

1121
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:26,680
I mean you could be painting on the bottom screen and then like the upper screen can be showing like coordinated music or animation

1122
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,160
I mean, let's face it Mario Paint for the Super Nintendo

1123
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,360
It kind of sucked

1124
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:37,000
I mean a lot of us have fond memories of it and created the end like the things that were in Nintendo Power

1125
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,300
Like I remember Nintendo Power had the little guide and you could create, you know your own little things from it

1126
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:46,620
like the musics and the animations like it would show you how to do it step by

1127
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:50,300
step but in the big scope of things I mean you could only really do like nine

1128
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:55,500
frames of a small animation that's really shitty I mean it's we have fond

1129
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:01,060
memories of it but it's it really wasn't that great okay but now I think a game

1130
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:05,140
like that could be pretty awesome especially with hello Wi-Fi I could beam

1131
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:08,820
things you know across this could be like the evolution of PictoChat and

1132
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:12,040
and maybe a way to commercialize Pictochat and get a little money off it

1133
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,620
because think about Mario Paint

1134
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:17,280
could be like something you could chat with people online or I wonder if

1135
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,680
they're gonna include Pictochat as part of the revolution

1136
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:22,660
possibly over the internet who knows

1137
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:26,860
but then are we going to get close to a Picto rape that we're talking about

1138
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:28,220
earlier oh you mean like

1139
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:31,420
well no because you know Nintendo would say everybody has to be on the friends

1140
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:31,900
list

1141
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:35,540
they have to be your friends list people that's so like did you know in

1142
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:38,340
Metroid you can't voice chat with people unless they're your friends list people

1143
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:43,180
Oh. Yeah. So that whole, like, ooh, voice chat. I have maybe, like, two people on my

1144
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:46,300
Metroid friends list, and I haven't really played Metroid lately because of all these

1145
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,340
other damn games that have come out, so.

1146
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:53,340
It's a wonder if Bob Ross and his happy little trees, they'll probably be M-rated, you know,

1147
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,340
and...

1148
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:58,900
Yeah, because of the fact that I might be able to paint a penis or a vagina in this

1149
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:03,340
game, which is likely to be the first thing many of you try to paint if you're given a

1150
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:04,340
like...

1151
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,340
Would it be a happy little vagina?

1152
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:12,340
be a very happy little penis or vagina. Does this game have to be rated M because of what

1153
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:17,540
you can do with your imagination? I don't know. Can you imagine some parent suing Bob

1154
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:27,860
Ross Foundation or whatever for this horrible, horrific game? My kid painted a penis! And

1155
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:33,780
on that note, I think we're going to go ahead and go to our break. So stay tuned, we'll

1156
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:47,500
We'll come back at you a little later with Part B of tonight's show.
