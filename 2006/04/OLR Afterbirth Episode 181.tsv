30	299	Thank you.
142209	144130	Bring on the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth.
144170	144610	Here we are.
144630	147331	It's the part of the show you can only hear on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
147351	149111	It's too hot to podcast, people.
149952	153553	I love this comment from SSJ100Matt in our chat room.
154013	156594	Those two should have a Friday Night Nerd podcast.
156634	158455	I think referring to Spike and DarkSakura.
159196	160477	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
187751	189672	So what's the plan for the Silent Hill movie, yo?
189712	191133	I know we've got to go see it, but what?
191613	202938	Yeah, I want to get a big, big group together on Friday because I'm having one of our listeners and a good friend come up from the Bay Area to come to the movie with us.
205199	210841	And we just want to get as many people together to just nerd out the movie.
210901	214623	And it would be cool, though, if we all had those cheese hats and repainted them to look like Pyramid Head.
216329	216830	Nerd!
217351	219155	That is such a good idea.
219475	223543	I would totally do that and like carry around like, you know, a little three inch spear.
224158	227479	You know what's sad, though, is that I'm getting invited to a lot of these things.
227519	230860	I mean, I'll probably do Jamie's because she does have the birthday advantage.
231260	232961	Booyah!
233541	237742	But, you know, I know there's a lot of people planning on going to see this, like a lot of video game fans.
237762	241363	So I'm very excited for how... I just hope they don't disappoint us with this movie.
241383	242043	I'm very excited.
242583	247005	I would love to do the cosplay, though, at the movie because that is fucking nerdy.
248130	251856	We could put out a press release and everything in the media would be there taping us in our pyramid head hats.
251876	252437	That would be great.
252758	253599	That would be awesome.
254040	254661	Like a hot dog.
254681	257485	We should call a movie theater and try to sponsor something locally.
257505	258207	That would be awesome.
260534	268938	I know I'm going to be putting out a massive review on our stuff.orangechallengeradio.com which has been given some attention by me lately.
268958	272080	Yes, I actually looked at it the other day and you're the only one updating it.
273140	277562	I think that's going to actually see a lot of updating during E3.
277642	285286	My personal plan is to go to the business center at E3 and do intermittent stuff updates.
285706	301313	and we're still trying to figure out how we're going to do podcasts unfortunately we're in a weird situation where our hotels are going to be very far apart so I'm just hoping that we can somehow do the podcast still in some way I've got shuttle from my hotel to E3 if someone can get me right back to my hotel
302093	302974	We might be able to make that work.
303114	303534	It's gravy.
304095	310680	Except, now this is what my hard thing is going to be is because I'm pulled between doing DDR Freak stuff and doing Orange Lounge stuff.
310940	311560	So, you know.
311820	314002	But I'm trying to fit everything in.
314202	315523	So if worse comes to worse.
315743	317325	I'm probably going to skip Roscoe's this year.
317385	319987	You might have to contribute individual reports or something.
320027	320707	We'll figure something out.
320727	322609	I'm probably going to skip Roscoe's this year though.
322689	323950	Roscoe's is overrated now.
324390	326331	It's so 2004.
326371	329974	I can't eat Roscoe's anymore just because I get sick off of most food now.
330074	330254	So.
330274	330635	Yeah.
331135	331977	DarkSakura, how was your week?
331997	334060	I had the bird flu.
345322	346062	And then I worked.
346722	350604	And it was my spring break when I had the bird flu, so thankfully I didn't have to go to class on Tuesday.
352224	354505	Which was my flash class anyway, and I would have been dead.
354525	356526	I'd have been like, ugh, flash, blah.
357206	358726	I love my flash class, but God.
359607	366549	I did, though, it was pretty funny because the week before, the teacher had us review our animated ads.
366849	368149	You know, I did the Silent Hill one.
368910	372451	And she spent like maybe two minutes on everybody else, like 15 minutes on mine.
374318	375038	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
399552	405814	So I'm trying to figure out how to do that because I'm still a Flash newbie, but at least I've got the design part down.
405834	407274	Well, congratulations.
407934	408274	Thank you.
408334	410695	I'm actually working on a Flash design for us.
411415	417717	I'm working on doing a special Orange Lounge photo gallery, but I need to take a picture of your desk.
418337	418857	Oh, God.
419277	419357	Why?
419377	425020	Because I'm going to use your computer as the frame for the placeholder for the images to pop up in.
425340	425620	Oh, okay.
426200	429081	But it's going to be a month or so out.
429101	430482	It's going to require some work.
430502	432042	With all the crap all around and everything?
432062	435124	Yes, the crap is... I'm actually going to add in more crap in Illustrator.
435224	435624	Oh, goody.
436484	441306	So it's going to be the uber crappy desk, and I'm going to expand your desk by another two feet.
441386	442627	Yeah, I wish I could really have that.
442647	443167	That would be nice.
443948	446250	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
463153	478801	and I basically went to Golf Land drunk and went and played some mini-golf and I apparently played some Mario Kart GP which I am right now recording to my computer so we can put it on the website because I'm doing a lot of yelling.
478981	483704	And the face that I have on the thing is hilarious.
484304	485565	You have to see this.
486705	487566	But yeah, I look...
489084	493307	I don't remember actually playing Mario Kart.
494387	497429	I wish I could tell you if it was good or not, but I don't remember.
497669	502992	I know I'm not getting married anytime soon, but I kind of want to have a bachelor party just so I can get drunk and be the center of attention for a night.
503832	505533	I'll go, and I'll buy you drinks.
505633	506034	Yay!
507474	510056	Maybe I can have an anti-bachelor party, I don't know.
512814	514415	I was punching the screen!
514555	516215	As you were, it was great.
516995	518036	Alright, check out that video soon.
518056	519696	It'll be up on OrangeLandrider.com.
521197	522177	Spike, how was your week?
522217	522597	How was your day?
523597	529639	I threw a party Friday night, which was basically a big excuse to play Power Stone with people I don't really know.
530179	532300	And I played Karaoke Revolution several times.
532480	533700	Didn't we sing I Got You, Babe?
534241	535521	Yes, we did!
535641	536721	I do a mean share.
536981	537842	I just wanted to point out.
538262	539762	I love doing a mean share.
539862	540523	It was awesome.
541003	541683	Good times.
542984	543244	All right.
543784	544665	Is that it?
546326	547606	You're just a regular party animal.
548147	548587	Oh, yeah.
549267	549527	No.
550088	552949	So, yeah, no, I had a very game-centric week.
553549	554930	Threw a party, played games.
555730	556871	Played games, not at a party.
556891	558452	That's the long and the short of it.
559132	559432	All right.
560253	560673	Sounds awesome.
561483	562763	My week of my day was pretty good.
563063	568705	I played a little bit of Final Fantasy XI and played other games.
568845	571745	I had an overall pretty mellow week.
572065	576126	Easter was today, so I went to my parents' where we had leftovers because my parents didn't feel like cooking.
577047	584568	And then, I'm trying to think, Friday we went to that party, so that was part of the weekend there because you don't exactly live around the corner, so it's a little bit of a drive.
585289	585689	But it's good.
585709	586929	It was all worth it.
587669	590950	But I was probably the only sober person there, which was kind of interesting.
591610	592770	So that made me a little sad.
593550	595750	Your share would have been a little better drunk, I think.
595870	596391	Probably.
596751	598431	I would have been a lot louder and probably woken up the neighbors.
598471	599811	But then driving home wouldn't have been fun.
599991	604212	See, the reason I threw a party this week is because my downstairs neighbors were evicted.
605092	605232	Oh!
605292	607732	That's why I wasn't telling anyone to shut their mouth.
608213	609633	Oh, God, that's great.
609973	610233	Oh, yeah.
610273	612153	We should have held the party downstairs.
612433	613233	We could have broke in.
613633	614474	Such a good idea.
614494	615274	Would have been awesome.
616394	616714	All right.
618355	621436	Uh, moving on, let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
621476	622116	Sound like a plan?
622757	622997	Sure.
623157	633540	Alright, since we have new people listening for the first time tonight, the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match is where we play three songs for you guys, a clip of last week's winner, and then two new songs for you guys.
634060	644203	And, uh, you guys vote, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week music and video game program.
644663	646284	Or I should say video game and music program.
646624	647464	Hello.
648465	650865	So, we got song number one tonight.
650885	653126	You only get to hear a clip of that because it won last week.
653306	656807	It's Loki's pick, and I believe it was the X-Noise Diffusion.
656947	657908	That was the name of the song?
658308	658508	Yes.
658808	662589	So here it is, a clip of song number one, last week's winner you can vote for tonight.
662649	670272	Remember, you cannot place a vote until all three songs have played, and at that time I'll tell you how you vote, but you have to be in the chat room to do it.
670352	671912	OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat.
672192	674513	Here's a clip of song number one, X-Noise with Diffusion.
680476	681117	Thanks for watching!
759096	766878	Alright, that's song number one you can vote for tonight, X-Noise with Diffusion, but it has to beat two other songs, two brand new songs going into tonight's cage match.
767339	774841	The first one is my pick, and I decided to pick a song by a group called Bittersweet, which I think is a good name for a band.
775141	780683	And the song's called Dirty Laundry, and I have a lot of that on the floor of my bedroom, so I think this is a very appropriate choice.
781043	783324	And I like this because it's kind of jazzy.
784304	785147	That's what I like about this.
785167	785970	So here's my pick.
786311	789522	Song number two, Bittersweet with Dirty Laundry.
790004	790305	Enjoy.
994451	996812	All right, that was song number two in tonight's case match.
997092	998993	Bittersweet with Dirty Laundry.
999073	1004255	Let's go around and see if they like that song in the studio or if they want to wash it.
1005135	1005855	DarkSakura.
1006215	1007676	It was cute and it wasn't trance.
1007716	1008236	It gets a nine.
1009497	1009877	Loki.
1010337	1010897	It was okay.
1010917	1011697	It gets like an eight.
1012198	1012598	Spike.
1013318	1016859	That flashed me back to the Sharon Apple portions of Macross Plus.
1017660	1019680	Big, big bonus in my book.
1019760	1021401	I'd definitely go with like a nine for that.
1022306	1024588	That for me was music to spank someone to.
1024989	1025149	Ow!
1025689	1026750	That gets a nine from me.
1027591	1028071	That's hot.
1029072	1030573	You've been a naughty listener.
1030633	1032475	You've been a very naughty listener.
1034356	1036458	Song number three comes to us from DarkSakura.
1036498	1040481	What did you decide to annoy the listeners, I mean bring joy with tonight?
1040581	1040842	Hey!
1041422	1042022	Just teasing.
1042323	1044124	This song's called Emo Kid.
1044765	1045545	That should say it all.
1046326	1047247	Alright, here it is then.
1047327	1049889	Song number three in tonight's cage match, Emo Kid.
1050882	1054264	Just don't call DarkSakura one or she'll rip your heart out and then stomp on it.
1055944	1058506	Dear Diary, Mood, apathetic.
1059206	1060787	My life is spiraling downward.
1061107	1064949	I couldn't get enough money to go to the Blood Red Romance and Suffocate Me Dry concert.
1065329	1073313	It sucks cause they play some of my favorite songs like Stab My Heart Because I Love You and Rip Apart My Soul and of course Stabby Rip Stab Stab.
1073853	1076614	And it doesn't help that I couldn't get my hair to that flippy thing either.
1077195	1078715	Like that guy from that band can do.
1079436	1079936	Some days...
1086284	1104657	I'm almost emo enough to start shaving my legs Cause I feel real deep when I'm dressing in drag I call it freedom of expression, most just call me a fag Cause our dudes look like chicks and our chicks look like dykes Cause emo is one step below transvestite Stop my breathing and slit my throat
1112832	1141097	I'm dark and sensitive with low self-esteem The way I dress makes every day feel like Halloween I have no real problems but I like to make believe I stole my sister's mascara, now I'm grounded for a week Sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies I can't get through a Hawthorne Heights album without sobbing Girls keep breaking up with me It's never any fun, they say they already have a pussy They don't need another one Stop my breathing and slit my throat I must be emo, I don't jump around when I go to shows
1142552	1157536	I must be emo, dyeing my hair and polish on my toes I must be emo, I play guitar and write suicide notes I must be emo My life is just a black abyss, you know?
1157756	1167258	It's so dark, and it's suffocating me Grabbing a hold of me and tightening its grip Tighter than a pair of my little sister's jeans Which look great on me, by the way
1169221	1197766	When I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction Hearing songs about getting dumped give me an erection I write in a live journal and wear thick rimmed glasses I tell my friends I bleed black and cry during classes I'm just a bad, cheap imitation of God Figuring me catch her in the rye and watch me jack off I wear skin tight clothes while hating my life If I said I like girls, I'd only be half right I look like I'm dead and just like a homo I must be emo, screw Xbox, I play old school Nintendo
1213012	1214493	My parents don't get me, you know?
1214973	1217394	They think I'm gay just because they saw me kiss a guy.
1217834	1219035	Well, a couple guys.
1219395	1221376	But I mean, it's the 2000s.
1221716	1225838	Can't two or four dudes make out with each other without being gay.
1226498	1228419	I mean, chicks dig that kind of thing anyways.
1229079	1229920	I don't know, diary.
1230140	1232141	Sometimes I think you're the only one that gets me.
1232781	1233861	You're my best friend.
1236342	1237263	I feel like tacos.
1240680	1244801	Song number three in tonight's KH match, Adam and Andrew with Emo Kid.
1244841	1249803	Let's see what kind of emotional reactions that got out of our judges here in the studio.
1249843	1251503	Remember, our votes don't count, yours do.
1251843	1252884	I'll tell you how to vote in just a minute.
1252924	1253504	DarkSakura.
1253644	1254144	Eleven.
1256745	1262487	One of my friends played that for me, the one who... That song is, like, the best.
1263167	1263627	Very cool.
1263847	1264787	It made me crack up.
1264987	1265287	Loki!
1266768	1268308	I didn't care for it very much.
1269489	1269769	Six.
1271734	1274516	Spike, my whole life is a dark room.
1275176	1277218	One big dark room.
1277838	1280100	Like, definitely a nine.
1281361	1281941	You know what, though?
1282062	1286525	I was going to give that song a high score, but then they had to go and make fun of people that play classic Nintendo.
1286605	1288406	I'm sorry, not cool.
1288446	1289527	So you lose some points for that.
1289828	1292510	However, it does entitle the song to get a six.
1293030	1296913	As in, six, six, six, the sign of the devil.
1298934	1299795	I want tacos.
1303087	1304488	I want a 39 cent taco.
1304848	1307569	Dear Diary, Mood, Apathetic.
1307810	1308210	All right.
1309470	1309891	Here you go.
1309931	1311472	Here's the three songs you can vote for tonight.
1311532	1313613	Song number one, X Noise, Diffusion.
1319636	1320616	Well, that was a shitty clip.
1320656	1321417	Let's try that again.
1326199	1326700	Much better.
1326760	1327060	All right.
1327120	1330962	Song number two you can vote for tonight, Bittersweet with Dirty Laundry.
1340539	1345301	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Adam and Andrew with Emo Kid.
1345321	1346242	Alright, place vote now.
1346302	1348623	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
1348663	1349063	Do it.
1349083	1349243	Do it.
1349263	1349443	Do it.
1349483	1349884	Or I'll cut you.
1368237	1368958	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1399361	1400602	Artistic in this context.
1400862	1402363	Is that another word for emo?
1404184	1404404	Yes.
1405525	1405985	But not really.
1406565	1407026	Heart!
1409027	1413069	Dear DeviantArt, My soul is black.
1414270	1416711	It is as black as the bottom of a kettle.
1418232	1424396	And because of the darkness within me, I feel the need to draw nothing but pretty light-colored flowers.
1425677	1427658	With sunshine and rainbows.
1428792	1432514	to express my desire to have love in my life.
1433414	1435895	Because otherwise it's a pit of loneliness.
1437836	1438497	I want burritos.
1439217	1440938	Isn't that the name of the new Morrissey single?
1441438	1442458	No, that was You Have Killed Me.
1443699	1444419	And that's actually true.
1445000	1446180	The new Morrissey stuff is pretty cool.
1447081	1453664	Okay, yeah, so like, let's just go back and just have Viva hate and then kill him before he can make his other records.
1455069	1461574	Well, I like the one he did with Suzy.
1462815	1463336	Oh, Interlude.
1463356	1464217	Yeah, that was awesome.
1466158	1467079	I like that one a whole lot.
1468380	1474885	I'm tallying up cage match votes right now, and Did You Lose a Sock actually has a DeviantArt he wanted to share.
1475386	1475986	I looked at it.
1476607	1477147	Oh, okay, cool.
1478068	1480150	And hooray for everybody giving Morrissey love.
1481149	1481509	Yay!
1481629	1483010	I'm actually a really big Morrissey fan.
1483031	1484231	I've seen them like four times.
1484352	1486213	I just, this new stuff doesn't work for me.
1489155	1494039	Oh shoot, but the Babyland last night though, I cannot rave enough about how awesome they were.
1494319	1496701	Okay, this is how the night went to start off.
1497582	1502445	Iguana Girl and I go and get sushi, which you know, me and her and sushi, we fell right into a sushi coma.
1503066	1504307	And it was beer.
1504327	1504627	Yeah.
1504963	1505923	Fuck I love sushi.
1505943	1507043	Me too.
1507063	1508364	I have to take you to this place.
1508424	1509284	It's really, really yummy.
1509304	1512905	It's called Sugata in Berkeley.
1513065	1513385	Really good.
1513625	1521347	You know, when I was out in Chesapeake, Virginia weeks and weeks ago, that trip I was on for a couple weeks, I had really freaking good sushi when I was there.
1521647	1524427	And who would have thought you could get good sushi in Chesapeake?
1524647	1525808	But it was actually really good.
1526268	1526708	I was surprised.
1527368	1529929	This place that I went to was really expensive, but they were very good.
1529949	1531469	And I got a free Japanese lesson.
1533275	1535036	He asked me something that I didn't quite understand.
1535096	1536917	I was like, uh, chotto.
1536957	1538078	He's like, chotto!
1539078	1541259	He's so happy that I used it right.
1541919	1544541	So I said, next time I come in, I'm going to order like this.
1544861	1546782	Koreto, koreto, koreto.
1547062	1547542	Ah, are.
1548823	1549903	And he laughed at that.
1549923	1550564	That was pretty funny.
1550584	1551564	It was a bad joke, but hey.
1551824	1553625	Yeah, I guess you have to speak Japanese to get it.
1553745	1554966	I thought it was funny.
1555226	1555946	Isn't that cute?
1555987	1557047	She sounds like a cartoon.
1557227	1558808	This and this and this and oh, that.
1560376	1560796	Oh, okay.
1561257	1570361	Anyway, so we went on to the venue and the first band sucked, so we went and got beer at the brewery across the street.
1570602	1574664	And then we went back and the Mormons were on and they sucked, so we went and got more beer.
1575464	1576845	We missed Ninja Academy.
1577785	1581667	Go back to listen to 8-Bit and then Babyland freaking owns my soul.
1582568	1582928	So, yeah.
1583188	1584049	Are you done tallying now?
1584189	1584609	Oh, they're done.
1584649	1584949	I'm done.
1584989	1585550	I'm ready to go.
1585590	1587471	You ready to hear who won tonight's cage match?
1587491	1587751	Woo-hoo!
1588513	1589554	It's a good time.
1589614	1590374	Let's check it out.
1590754	1591715	Actually, I was surprised.
1591755	1593516	It wasn't quite a landslide vote tonight.
1593556	1595056	All three songs got a lot of lovin'.
1595377	1597438	But in the end, there could be only one.
1598058	1600059	And the wave of the future is... Emo.
1600099	1601760	You silly little emo kids, you.
1608971	1612375	Sky, what do you think the revolution's other secret is?
1630114	1630695	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1647654	1648434	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1672168	1672708	Maybe... You know what?
1672768	1680114	Instead of me cosplaying at Faname, I think my iBook should cosplay, and it can cosplay as Bjork.
1681135	1682176	I could cosplay as Bjork.
1682216	1682796	That might be fun.
1682896	1683076	What?
1683356	1684797	No, you have to cosplay with me.
1685338	1686419	I'm not doing Naruto.
1688040	1689441	I have a headband you could borrow.
1690081	1690482	I know you do.
1690502	1692783	I just picked up my Sand Village because I'm cosplaying Tamari.
1694345	1695385	It's too big for my head.
1695405	1696126	What?
1696949	1699189	And this whole time I thought you had a huge head.
1699330	1699610	Shut up.
1702130	1702970	No, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
1703190	1703370	What?
1703450	1703630	Rob.
1703890	1704070	Rob.
1704170	1704331	What?
1704351	1706051	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
1706071	1706331	What?
1706931	1707151	Yo.
1707411	1707571	Hi.
1708851	1709192	Guess what?
1709492	1709672	What?
1709932	1710152	Hi.
1710792	1712052	So your birthday party's next week.
1712252	1712652	Yes, it is.
1712692	1715233	And your birthday birthday itself is on... Wednesday.
1715353	1715733	Wednesday.
1715753	1716533	I'm like, when day is it?
1716593	1716753	Okay.
1717073	1718473	And Thursday, right?
1719234	1720574	Yes, we're doing something on Thursday.
1720874	1721174	I don't know.
1721755	1724618	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1739249	1740551	But it's not as bad as 40, so smile!
1762515	1767118	But no, I hung out with Disney Punk 10 on last Saturday.
1767799	1770020	And then I went to see Babyland last night.
1770580	1774383	And then Wednesday I'm going to eat at Bon Lair.
1774783	1776565	It's a pub downtown for fish and chips.
1777325	1779507	Don't tell the Stalker fans where you're going to be.
1780908	1781268	Okay.
1782449	1784030	And then Thursday we're doing something.
1784070	1785091	And Friday is Silent Hill.
1785151	1789474	And Saturday is my birthday party at my annual Dave & Buster's.
1790327	1792871	and Sunday is me falling into a coma and sleeping.
1794213	1797598	And then Monday my massage therapist is taking me to the pub.
1798709	1799049	Lucky.
1799069	1802993	I don't want a massage therapist at all, let alone one to take me out.
1803293	1805655	Are you going to get a massage at the pub?
1805855	1806075	No.
1806496	1807156	No, no, no, no, no.
1807176	1807777	It'd be hot.
1808177	1810038	Is this pub going to do the candle thing again?
1810058	1811259	Because that sounds awesome.
1811340	1812060	I want to see it.
1812120	1812561	I don't know.
1812741	1814842	They every so often do Ye Olde Pub Night.
1814902	1816804	I wish they would play pipe organ music, too.
1816824	1817905	That would be badass.
1817925	1818525	Not in a pub.
1818565	1821128	They need to have bagpipes or something.
1821928	1822669	Or a pan flute.
1822689	1823910	Yeah.
1824750	1852025	and then I'm waiting for birthday money I'm actually getting something I've asked for one of my birthday presents the one from my husband to be something for the show sweet I've asked for a high MD mini disc recorder I want that camcorder Loki has I've decided it'll make the home porno so much easier I may have my own camera person I may have my own camera person at E3 too if all works out
1852628	1853028	Very cool.
1853389	1853809	We hope.
1853849	1854370	We're trying.
1854670	1855010	We'll see.
1855711	1857773	You're fierce like a diva in a good way.
1858834	1865980	Can I wear a peacock dress like Margaret Cho does?
1867342	1867602	Ew.
1868382	1868543	Ew.
1868943	1869103	Ew.
1869163	1869564	What, Loki?
1869584	1869804	What?
1870745	1872987	They put out the floor plan for E3 this year.
1873207	1873667	Oh, it's up?
1874188	1877511	Granted, I personally love hanging out at Konami's booth.
1878894	1879515	Unfortunately.
1880736	1882557	Instead of Buena Vista being where it was.
1882817	1883077	Uh-huh.
1883698	1884919	It's the N-Gage Arena!
1885840	1886180	What?!
1886440	1888422	Oh, no, they put Konami next to N-Gage?
1888442	1890764	Yeah, N-Gage, no.
1892105	1894086	I heard SNK's not in the main building this year.
1894307	1895167	They're down in Kenshia.
1895508	1897229	So who took their place, is what I want to know.
1898010	1898130	Um...
1900253	1901774	Yeah, but Ketch is the cool place to hang out.
1901834	1902735	It's like the indie place.
1902795	1903215	Yeah, but, you know.
1903275	1904176	It's like where all the hipsters hang out.
1904196	1906097	And Rockstar doesn't have a booth this year either, I heard.
1906117	1908739	Well, 2K has a booth, and that might as well be Rockstar.
1911461	1914743	You know, we never answered the poor guy's question, what do we think the next secret on the revolution is.
1915403	1917565	We've mentioned holographic, or what was it?
1917645	1918846	What was this?
1918946	1920167	Stereoscopic 3D?
1921247	1922768	That's the... Holo projections.
1922828	1924309	Also mentioned nachos.
1924890	1925090	Yes.
1925610	1927852	That's the best serious answer I've got for you.
1931038	1932879	and Roz says more like N-Gay.
1933019	1933739	No, I'm sorry.
1933919	1937660	The N-Gage is not allowed to be gay because that would disrespect my people.
1938201	1939341	I was just going to go there.
1940541	1942022	I don't see an America's Army booth, though.
1942802	1943342	Yay.
1945123	1945883	You know what?
1945903	1951725	We need to have a contest now, thanks to the chat room, where I give out my infamous nacho cheese sauce recipe.
1953646	1955247	Let's get to the chat room, FU, shall we?
1955567	1956287	No, I don't think so.
1956347	1958728	We're going to give them an old classic song to start us off.
1974921	1976102	All right, chatroom FUs.
1977163	1978584	We're using that again from now on.
1978705	1981207	Dark Knight says, FU to me working on Easter Sunday.
1981347	1981908	End of line.
1982628	1986632	Illusion says, FU goes to Loki for not singing karaoke last night.
1988834	1994539	VXJasonXV says, FU to the chatroom.
1994559	1995320	That song blew.
1997338	1998739	Yay.
1998839	2005042	GK128 says, F you to my GPU fan that it decided it wants to keep flickering on and off, leaving my laptop hot.
2005422	2007483	Now I have to try and fix you, you bastard.
2008383	2014226	MiniMe283 says, F you to EGM for still not sending me my first issue, and I renewed in freaking December.
2014706	2019569	I complained to them last week, and they said I'd get my April issue in six to eight weeks.
2021314	2022575	Yeah, it's just like Game Informer.
2022615	2024456	I haven't freaking got my May issue yet.
2024676	2027537	MiniMe283, you won our freaking 24 contest.
2027557	2028738	You have no right to be upset tonight.
2030259	2031599	I retract that FU.
2033060	2039623	The23rdMagga says, Quick FU to having to spend an entire week feigning interest in every little thing a relative says you should be interested in.
2040184	2043085	Also a big FU to being cooped up in a hotel for an entire week.
2043565	2050329	FU to being forced to watch five straight hours of Law & Order to the point where you root for the asshole defense attorney who looks nothing like Phoenix Wrong.
2052199	2056883	Legend of Zaku says, something and I haven't played in five months.
2056923	2058584	But the first part of his FU got cut off.
2059525	2059965	How sad.
2060986	2063368	DarkTetsuya says, FU to Travis Donovan.
2063408	2066270	He threatened to move his show to Sunday just to mess with you guys.
2066470	2066851	LOL.
2067591	2069252	Oh, oh, bring it, bitch.
2069272	2070113	Because you know what?
2070213	2077319	If you even try and move a show on to Sundays, we will bring the Spike and Dark Sakura nerd show to Saturday nights.
2080379	2081700	And who volunteered to do this for me?
2084101	2087482	I think somebody's just bitter that we have higher ratings this one month.
2089323	2091684	It's alright, we have love for Travis.
2091944	2095106	For the people who don't know out there, why don't you explain who Travis is?
2095606	2104110	Oh, he's the host of UnderStationLive.org, which I shouldn't be giving him a free plug when he says such nasty things about us, but it was the show that I got my start on.
2104430	2107251	Actually, I should say my second song, because I actually started on a college show.
2107371	2108532	I was the most often guest.
2108772	2115543	That's right, DarkSakura had a lot of experience on that program as well, and it was the first live 365 thing we did.
2115984	2119289	And to answer your question, who's taking SNK's booth, it would be Game Infinity.
2121272	2121713	Oh, they were there.
2122114	2122635	They were there, though.
2124447	2128951	By the way, chatroom guys, you need to send those over private message to me, otherwise I miss them.
2128991	2134916	I'll try, because I know we have new chatters tonight, I'll try and read them out of the chatroom, but please, please, please send them over private message if you want to make sure I get them.
2135737	2141862	Legend of Zaku says, F you to myself for not putting more money in for playing Supernova when I went to my nearby location test.
2142022	2146967	F you to having shitty stamina while playing Supernova since I made the mistake of wearing Converse.
2148872	2167410	SSJ100 Matt says F you to Anizona the Arizona anime convention for putting a 1200 person cap on the convention second year in a row they've underestimated the anime fan population in Phoenix Ranma says F you to the internet and file sharing I can't find the theme to Finders Keepers damn that was an awesome game show
2167910	2173694	Jeremy Todd 1 says, F you the week goes to my school because we don't have a spring break.
2173754	2175495	We just get a three-day break for Easter.
2175675	2176255	F you to school.
2176435	2181298	Oh, and F you to making me sit by the computers for a couple hours straight to listen to your show.
2182079	2185200	Boss Tone says, F you to not having a supernova test location near me.
2185741	2188142	And I think there was one in the chat from somebody new.
2189283	2192485	Oh, did you lose a sock says F you to the people who hated the emo song.
2192505	2193586	I have it on my iPod.
2194006	2195827	And DJ Kibbles and Bits says,
2196227	2200788	says F you to OXM trying to qualify scoring a 10 for Fight Night Round 3.
2202528	2205249	And HitStun says F you to the feedback of my voice on the Skype line.
2205269	2205969	It's distracting.
2206949	2208489	Turn your volume down when you do that.
2209049	2209309	Alright.
2210630	2211150	That's it.
2212310	2212990	What, Extifer?
2213010	2213990	Why'd you steal a microphone?
2214010	2214690	Do you have something to say?
2216171	2217111	Yeah, you gotta turn it on, too.
2218511	2219631	Are you ever gonna do a show again?
2219951	2220451	Sure!
2221232	2221532	When?
2222792	2222892	On...
2224053	2224773	Someday.
2225494	2225994	I don't know.
2226434	2227655	I still want a title.
2228375	2232118	If people can come up with a fucking title, I can come up with a show.
2232138	2233939	I thought you were going to do Extover's World of Thursdays.
2234739	2235119	I can.
2235139	2236060	You can call it Friday Eve.
2237321	2239262	Ooh, I won't, but thank you for that.
2239282	2239962	Well, fine.
2242383	2245305	Miklatov, say hello to our listeners.
2245505	2245765	Hi.
2245945	2246426	How you doing?
2247326	2247626	Fine.
2247806	2248047	Yeah.
2248627	2252369	Anything you want to say about, you know, stuff going on in the world?
2255257	2255657	No.
2256338	2256618	Alright.
2256638	2261881	Wow, that was five minutes of radio.
2262061	2265823	He said no like that was just clever or something.
2266264	2266804	Are you high?
2266964	2267364	Jesus.
2272147	2273467	Friday is Eve.
2273728	2275048	That might work, actually.
2275108	2277109	That's going to do it for tonight's Afterbirth.
2277569	2278730	Have a great week, everybody.
2278970	2280411	Woo, doggie!
2280691	2281992	Now you have something to say, Miklatov.
2282092	2285073	Everybody go watch Silent Hill the movie this coming week.
2285333	2286494	We already talked about that.
2288235	2288835	When is that?
2289475	2290476	On Friday.
2290856	2291336	On Friday?
2291817	2292077	When?
2292757	2294118	The 21st, the night it opens.
2294878	2296679	I will talk to you more about it later than what time.
2296719	2298640	I'm thinking either the last or second to last show.
2299272	2300295	I could probably do one of those.
2300335	2301959	So I'll post a time up in my lab journal.
2302280	2302941	Okay, cool.
2303021	2303623	I will go.
2303703	2305126	Tell him about the cheese head idea.
2305908	2308856	I want to get cheese hats and repaint them to be pyramid head.
2309682	2311202	So, the color of rust?
2311522	2311782	Yeah.
2311983	2312663	That'd be hot.
2312763	2318484	So, we all go in... We have to fill in the holes, because I don't want to be a broken pyramid head.
2318744	2322765	We'll be the broken pyramid head society.
2323225	2324265	That sounds depressing.
2325245	2327846	And we need little, like, three-inch, you know, spikes to go.
2328446	2329346	I'll just take a knife.
2329486	2330947	Plastic knives!
2331467	2332407	How about a real knife?
2332727	2333747	We go in with sporks.
2334367	2335408	Oh, sporks would be cool, actually.
2335428	2336048	We go in with sporks.
2336108	2336528	Sporks.
2337467	2338428	I'm a legend.
2338568	2339008	I am a legend.
2366562	2367803	No, I said alleged.
2368063	2368183	Oh.
2369263	2370083	I thought I was legend.
2370284	2371044	No, you're not.
2371064	2371684	That's a great book.
2372004	2372825	That's a great movie.
2373065	2373465	Yeah.
2373925	2374525	Stop talking.
2375366	2377166	Um, I like beer.
2378367	2379487	What do you want to say, Christopher?
2380268	2382969	Wondershowsin is so freaking hilarious.
2384658	2387399	Rob got to watch some of it last night.
2388039	2389639	I'm seriously ending this show.
2389999	2393580	So tune in next week for more fun here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2393920	2395940	Here it is, kids, your fortune cookie message.
2396160	2396780	Oh, the day.
2397860	2400401	I will send a flood to wipe out all the bad things.
2400901	2403321	I will save two of everything, but everything else goes.
2403661	2404842	And there'll be a lot of umbrellas.
2405662	2409042	You, Noah, stop what you're doing and build me an ark.
2409743	2411943	And Noah, who is Sean Connery, who is...
2413311	2415193	I'm working on a speedboat at the moment.
2417815	2419076	Speedboat's much faster.
2419176	2421158	I'll shoo across the water a lot faster.
2422979	2424641	Be great photos for the Bible.
2424681	2436891	Now, I appreciate your sense of publicity, but I want an ark with a big room for poo.
2436951	2437772	It's gonna be important.
2440788	2442188	Speedboat, let's go for a speedboat.
2442208	2443789	We can get all the animals with long ears.
2443829	2449270	They can sit along the side of that ears and... Because I like that.
2450570	2451610	No, you build me an ark.
2451770	2454030	Put a big motor in an ark if you want compromise.
2455851	2457591	So he started to build himself an ark.
2457611	2458751	Started sawing up timber.
2461312	2462832	That's not actually how you start sawing, is it?
2463312	2468613	You start sawing by going... That first bit where you...
2476733	2482136	Then you're into the middle bit of where you feel like your dad.
2486980	2491123	When your dad used to say, I'm off out to the garage to saw a plank of wood in heart.
2493845	2496046	There we go.
2498828	2499629	No reason for it.
2500925	2503426	Now, let's see if Dr. Bronowski's still on television.
2503546	2504786	The Ascent of Man.
2507127	2508507	Sundays with my dad, that was.
2509847	2520730	So, yes, um, so the middle bit of the song, and then the end goes back into, and after a while, Noah realized he was actually punching a baboon.
2524351	2524931	Get off me!
2530081	2531643	Alright kids, that's it.
2531703	2531963	End of line.
