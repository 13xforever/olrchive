1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
who syndicates our show weekly. We also let them have a crack at this little live

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,260
segment.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,520
So tonight we thought okay we're not going to be having a live show next week

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,320
because

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,560
Loki's getting married, right Loki? Yes.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,300
So we thought, and we have a lot of chatters who wants to know, who

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,240
is Loki getting married to? So we asked her to sit in for a little bit so we could

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,200
say hello. So please say hello to Nellie.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,600
Hi everybody. How you doing? I'm doing good. So

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,680
you're getting married to Loki next week, correct? Sadly enough, yes.

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,720
Why do you say sadly enough?

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,520
Sadly for him. First thing they wanted to know, are you into video games at all?

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,320
No. No, why not? Because they're boring.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,320
Do you think they take away from

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,400
cuddle time? No, I have a pretty rigid regime in the house

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,400
where he can't play them when I'm there.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,360
I don't understand the fascination.

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,120
You don't? No. That's right. I don't even know how to use the buttons.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,200
What are you into? Porn.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,720
As you've told everybody already. I was just teasing though. You don't have to

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,120
say that just because I said that. Are you really into porn?

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,720
I guess. And what kind of porn do you like? All kinds.

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,120
All right, that's cool. Dog porn. So there's not a single like dog porn?

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,560
She's just trying to make herself sound freaky because you're marrying her.

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,560
How long have you and Matt been together?

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
It's going to be five years in July.

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,560
So what made you choose the 30th for your wedding date of April?

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,560
I don't know, random.

29
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,560
Did you just throw a dart at the calendar and that's what you got?

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,560
Actually, sort of. I opened the calendar and I pointed my finger and there it was.

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,560
How did he propose?

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,560
I can't think.

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,560
It was that awful.

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,560
No, but there was a lack of clothing at that time.

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,000
Ew! Oh God, I gotta wash my brain, I gotta wash my brain. No, it wasn't that bad, it was very sweet.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,760
I was Loki's roommate at the time.

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,080
Yes you were, I think you were probably like right outside too.

38
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,960
Like with your computer. Doing video games. Masturbating, I don't know.

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,640
Oh maybe, I don't know. Let's see.

40
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,840
What else was I gonna ask you? So he's going to E3

41
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,960
like a couple weeks after the wedding. I know, bastard. And does that

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,360
piss you off? We've come to an agreement about it.

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay, what's the agreement? He gets to go to E3? And then he gets me a present.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,040
But what if he brings back a t-shirt?

45
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,360
Then he's gonna be in trouble. No! Anything he'll bring me I will love

46
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,240
because I love him and he basically lets me have whatever I want anytime I want.

47
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,040
So, it's about time I gave something back. What is it that you see in Loki?

48
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,120
Because a lot of our listeners, you know, think he's a dick.

49
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,840
They're fucking dicks. He's hot! I'm just kidding. Everybody loves Loki.

50
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,240
all right they just you know it's just the man except for the Apple fans cuz

51
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,040
that would you do you use computers now

52
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,800
a computer yeah

53
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,880
I know you're not that bigger he likes those stupid

54
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,120
pretty computers oh my god you like apples

55
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,480
they sell pretty so you like apples only cuz they're cute

56
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,240
I don't need to do anything on it I just need to be able to access my email look

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,720
a porn of course

58
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,520
not that it yeah the first day I had this laptop

59
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,160
I freaking couldn't even work on it at work because I had to go to a conference room to

60
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,000
remove the porn that she put on the backdrop. I'm funny, shut up.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,360
It was great. It was like this giant vagina

62
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,720
and the girl like didn't even do a good job waxing because you could see the

63
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,520
little hairs growing back. It was so funny.

64
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,700
Now I gotta leisure my brain.

65
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,640
This is why we don't podcast this little bonus segment here.

66
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,120
Well I actually did that during the show. I know you were, the week he got that laptop

67
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,240
you were, the first thing you did was started putting porn on it.

68
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,480
yeah cuz I was asking if you want a gay porn site so you could use I was trying

69
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
to send him some time

70
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,080
what kinda work do you do for a living

71
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,360
you don't have to tell us where but you know what kinda work I talk on the phone and yell at

72
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,920
dumbasses all day really ever had any really annoying customers you just gotten a yell at

73
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,680
completely I don't yell at customers I yell at notaries

74
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,920
and every notary is an idiot pretty much okay

75
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,960
I don't know I don't have any funny stories I should have prepared better

76
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,960
that's alright well you came on here last minute you're a good sport did you see the

77
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,640
shirt we got him

78
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,720
last week? Yes, it's funny, he wore it to work. Did he? Okay.

79
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,040
That's good. We just want to make sure you weren't going to be offended by it, but I knew you.

80
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,240
Game over! You know it's totally true.

81
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,560
I know! He's done for!

82
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,840
The chat room is saying, uh, Loki's whipped. Is this true?

83
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,400
No.

84
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,720
Sometimes I wish we were a TV show. Oh!

85
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,040
Plug my Myspace thing, it's got a picture of

86
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,080
how whipped he is, I guess. Does it? Okay, so you're in the top eight on our MySpace, I believe.

87
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,280
Didn't we move you in there? I think we did. So if you go over to MySpace.com

88
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,720

89
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,600
I think so. So check it out. And they want to know what Loki's shirt in the video you just put

90
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:09,320
up on OLRPSP.com says. It says, I'm a groom, I'm doomed, or something. What? I'm a groom, I'm doomed,

108
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,840
Wow. It's really not that interesting. It's just a specific picture. Again, Matt's best

109
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,040
man's fiance made me a little favor too to take with me for my bachelorette party because

110
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,920
I had my party the same day. What did they do at the bachelorette party?

111
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,320
Nothing. They wouldn't let me have a stripper. And then my coworker, Ejreen, who knows my

121
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,680
trying to think there's any more here they want us to do a broadcast from the

122
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,400
wedding but I don't think that's gonna happen I'm actually in the wedding I

123
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,840
know Rob's in the way don't I have to don't I have to subject myself to Jewish

124
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,240
traditions for the wedding? Yes, you do, you have to wear a little yarmulke. Shut up, Matt, nobody asks you.

125
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,720
Because you're Jewish, right? Yeah, I'm a Jew. Okay, well that's not a problem. We have listeners that are Jewish.

126
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,600
I have my Jew gold. After we're married, I shall show Matt where I stash it. Like South Park. Oh, you see, you like South Park.

127
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,940
Yeah. Okay, there you go. Oh boy, too hot for podcasts. That's right, you know, I will only

128
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,360
subject myself to such, you know, religious traditions. Well, one, I've never met a

129
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,480
Jewish person I didn't like. Seriously, I've never met a Jewish person I didn't like.

130
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,280
I can show you a few. I know, I'll probably meet some at the wedding, you know.

131
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,320
Ha! Yeah. But, you know,

132
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,480
I'm willing to try new and interesting things. It'll be fun.

133
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,560
Yeah, all kosher.

134
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,520
Alright, we're going to talk about games. So anything you want to say to our

135
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,720
listeners, our hundreds of thousands of listeners? Hi, listeners! Get a life!

136
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,520
Okay, thank you.

137
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,640
That's Nellie everybody, Loki's fiancee, the lucky gal.

138
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,360
Alright, let's shut the door. New listeners in chat tonight, we really appreciate that you guys.

139
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,560
Thank you so much for, you know, tuning in and supporting us.

140
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,320
It must be working, people must really be telling their friends, or maybe it was the,

141
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,920
could have been that story too, that got a little bit of publicity a couple weeks ago.

142
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,560
Wonder if we got anybody through that, I don't know.

143
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,620
Most people, who have their microphone on, most people

144
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,240
actually probably ignored that. I know a lot, there was only one

145
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,000
site that actually mentioned us, well not really mentioned us, they mentioned a site

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,240
that

147
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,320
stole the story from another site, that stole the story from another site,

148
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,560
about the story being correct

149
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,720
when the whole Castlevania thing came out. Yeah, that's right, when the

150
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,080
Nintendo Power confirmed the Castlevania thing, like,

151
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,160
nobody said, oh I guess this proves Orange Lawn's radio story is true.

152
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,320
But you know, that's how it works, is that people don't care

153
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,720
where the news originally came from. So why stop caring too?

154
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,640
well we'll see it was you know what we're gonna just make announcements on

155
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,780
the air only so that only our listeners get to hear it from now on and then the

156
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,960
rest of you guys can see it. I've done that before and everyone ignores it.

157
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,800
That's true. Well who cares? Our listeners found out that's the important thing.

158
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,840
Maybe it was just me. I seem to have an entourage of newbies. I don't give a shit about other people.

159
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,480
I seem to have an entourage of newbies. Maybe it was just me. I don't know. Maybe.

160
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,840
Alright let's go around. This is the after-birth portion of the show.

161
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,120
We don't podcast this because you know we talk, maybe we talk a little bit about

162
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,960
games but you know we talk about us and you know what we've been up to and just

163
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,240
a way for our fans to connect with us over the past few years because we used

164
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,560
to do this show for three hours when it was the Balmani show but if you

165
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,240
actually listen back then you know it would be about 30 minutes of Balmani and

166
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,320
then two and a half hours of you know fucking around. It was a train

167
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,080
wreck but it was THE train wreck. It was a train wreck everybody was buying

168
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,080
tickets for, at least all three of you that listen regularly.

169
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
How was your week?

170
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
How was your day?

171
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Magus!

172
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
Ah, my week.

173
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
My day.

174
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,620
Well, my week, high point in the week was going down to Dave and Buster's for a very

175
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,340
special birthday.

176
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,220
Not mine this time, though.

177
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,700
And a little bit of pet peeve about that.

178
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:51,040
They card everyone who goes in, and me, I'm almost 21, almost.

179
00:10:51,040 --> 00:11:01,400
They card me, I can't get in until the special birthday guest comes on in and says, oh, he's

180
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,760
with me.

181
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,600
But the thing about Dave and Busters, Dave and Busters is awesome.

182
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,800
If you haven't been there, it's, Rob put it best one time as Chuck E. Cheese for grownups.

183
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,920
Or I also say it's a Las Vegas hotel without gambling.

184
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,920
Well, pseudo-gambling, you have like the- Gambling for children, the tickets thing.

185
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Yeah, tickets.

186
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:27,920
You can get all sorts of shit there, and just all the machines they have are just pristine.

187
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Aside from that, I haven't really been doing much lurking game facts a bit, getting some World of Warcraft, trying to get my character up a couple honor ranks.

188
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
What level is your character in WoW?

189
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Currently 56, almost 57, Orc Rogue on Maelstrom, that's RP PvP, emphasis on RP.

190
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Wait, Maelstrom, I wonder if that's the same one he plays on.

191
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,920
No, but it's not, it's not PvP, his isn't PvP, I don't think.

192
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
He plays on Malfurion.

193
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
Malfurion, yeah.

194
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Very close name.

195
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
It's PvE, it's one of the newer PvE servers.

196
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
He's 60 on PvE, or on Malfurion.

197
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Xtifer is what we keep pointing to, my roommate.

198
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,920
So, but I stopped playing World of Warcraft, I think my highest character was like 25.

199
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
I didn't play very much.

200
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:33,920
It's kinda sad and I'm kinda ashamed of it. I started on Maelstrom on the day Maelstrom was launched, the day RP PvP servers were launched. I started my character, I started Croth, I started that rogue. And it's been about six months since the server came out, and I'm just now getting to sixty.

201
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
Wow. Well, you know what? That's okay.

202
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Stop and smell the steelbloom.

203
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,920
I played Final Fantasy XI for two years and never got a character to 75.

204
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,920
In fact, my highest level is 55, which is like nothing. Nothing.

205
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Like, right before I quit, I was finally doing Genkai 1, which is the...

206
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Limit Break 1.

207
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Yeah, break the limit for 50.

208
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,920
And I... just... because I'm a slow player.

209
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,920
But now I'm making better progress the second time around on my new server.

210
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm having a good time.

211
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Even though I gave Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 a negative review, I'm still playing it on Xbox 360

212
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,920
because I do like getting to sit my fat ass on the couch and play. I just think a lot of people are really going to be turned off by the whole front end stuff.

213
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,920
And you don't want to feel like you wasted the money on it?

214
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Yeah. I guess that's part of it too. I don't want to feel like my money's wasted.

215
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
Alright, anything else?

216
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
Uh, no, that's about it. I'm doing much.

217
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

218
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Um, my week was okay. I've been busy.

219
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:39,520
Just, I don't know, just kind of getting work stuff done. I have a ton of stuff we've been doing for E3. I've been buying lots of things.

220
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
I still don't have my confirmation. I'm getting scared.

221
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:49,520
I would just email them. Personally, I wouldn't worry about it, because if I got in, why wouldn't you get in? That makes no sense.

222
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,520
So, it's just because at the end, everybody's submitting their stuff last minute.

223
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,520
I know. I hope I get something tomorrow or I'm going to cry.

224
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,920
Just, yeah, be patient.

225
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:11,400
I've been doing business cards and stuff, website stuff, and just, I don't know, getting

226
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,800
ready for everything.

227
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,760
Finally, I got kind of a surprise.

228
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,560
My coworker, ironically enough, one I don't like too much, but apparently she has her

229
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,000
good streaks now and then.

230
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,600
She's all, so you're on the E3?

231
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
I'm like, yeah.

232
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:34,320
And she's all, well, um, Joel, do you want to, um, we have an extra invitation for the Nintendo party. Do you want to go?

233
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,920
I'm like, hell yeah! Do I want to go? So, um, they were-

234
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,000
Does the chicken have a pecker? Of course I want to go!

235
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,440
Yeah, they were, they were, apparently they're going. I don't know how they got in.

236
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,600
Um, apparently someone she knows, she has good ties with people, so I'm getting in.

237
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,280
Have her pass those ties along to us! Jesus, Dark Soccer and I want to go to that too.

238
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,600
I want to go to Sony too.

239
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,560
Here's the thing, hook me up.

240
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,360
Hook a brother up.

241
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,280
But they had a hell of a time getting me in, and they don't have any extra passes, otherwise

242
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,240
there would be no problem.

243
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,240
But you know, probably next year will be a little different story, so I'm looking forward

244
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,840
to it, because I cannot wait to try it, the revolution and stuff, so yeah, it should be

245
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
awesome.

246
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:21,240
Alright, my day and my week were okay, as I mentioned before, I've kind of talked about

247
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,520
a lot of it already, because of course I went to Dark Sakura's birthday thing yesterday

248
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,320
at Dave and Buster's and watched her drink a little bit.

249
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,860
By the way, just so you guys know what I got her for her birthday, I got her a

250
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,200
Thing of Patron,

251
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,640
the tequila she really likes.

252
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,160
It ain't cheap, let me put it that way.

253
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,880
But it's hers. Let's see, what else did I do?

254
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,000
Besides my car getting broken into, I just kind of sat around on my big butt

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,080
and played video games. It was kind of fun.

256
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,400
And went and saw Silent Hill. So yeah, I pretty much talked about my week already in

257
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,960
different parts of the podcast.

258
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,160
I don't live that exciting of a life, I'm sorry to say.

259
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,800
But I'm looking forward to E3 coming up very soon.

260
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,320
What are we, like two weeks away, three weeks away?

261
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,440
I remember we have this coming work week, another week, and

262
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,680
then E3 week.

263
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,360
Scary stuff.

264
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,120
And we just booked our hotel finally, too.

265
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,640
So we're going to be not that far from the E3 outpost,

266
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,240
because we're going to be doing stuff with our buddies

267
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,400
over there at allgames.com, which should be fun.

268
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,160
And it is open to the public all but Wednesday night.

269
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,680
I think all the other days it's open to the public.

270
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,120
So you can come down to the E3 outpost, and they're going to

271
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,680
be doing games and you know all that good stuff it's basically it's kind of

272
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,960
like a cyber cafe from what I understand but it's consoles and you can rent

273
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,360
consoles they have like HDTVs and Scott Rubin who used to be with G4TV.com and

274
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,200
his buddy Lawrence they do a show there every day over at AllGames.com so

275
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,120
they're gonna be doing that for E3 as well we're gonna be doing something

276
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,520
I don't know with our buddy Bobby who also does a show over there should be

277
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Let's see, should we get in the cage match? Do you guys have anything you want to talk about? Anything random?

278
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
I don't have an agenda for tonight. I didn't come up with anything, so...

279
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
I've been actually working on that, because...

280
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Okay, I'm trying to... My stupid laptop... Now, granted, I know everyone's like,

281
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Yo dude, I got a Mac! No, listen, I wanted to do stuff with my laptop.

282
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,520
So anyways, the whole problem was, I found out the reason why my laptop was crashing,

283
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,520
is because the RAM I had apparently was bad.

284
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,240
and so I had a a gig stick in here that I bought for a hundred bucks or whatever

285
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,480
and you know I looked at him like you know this already has a gig in it

286
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,000
and upgrading it only to a gig and a half you know four hundred bucks isn't

287
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,120
really a great deal

288
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,400
so I turned around took that money they got from the gig step bought

289
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,560
a a mini disc player for recording

290
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,720
audio interviews and wireless mics to go with that

291
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,480
so that's kinda cool but on top of that I've been trying to get my computer

292
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,080
network my computer home it works fine with this one course I just fucked it up

293
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,500
about a second ago when I said disable the wireless connection because I was

294
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,540
trying to job I was trying to change the network because it wasn't seeing you

295
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:54,020
because I GG but anyways hopefully now it's working no it's not because Windows

296
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:59,340
sucks good job same as my cage matches on the internet and you need to download

297
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:05,260

like stab my heart because I love you and rip apart my skull and of course stabby-rip

311
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
stab stab.

312
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,900
And it doesn't help that I couldn't get my hair to that flippy thing either.

313
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,180
Like that guy from that band can do.

314
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,180
Some days now.

315
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:20,140
I'm an emo kid, nonconforming as can be, you'd be nonconforming too if you looked just like

316
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,140
me.

317
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,860
I have paint on my nails and makeup on my face, I'm almost emo enough to start shaving

318
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,860
my legs.

319
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,260
Cause I feel real deep when I'm dressing in drag, I call it freedom of expression,

320
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,260
Let's just call me a fag, cause our dudes look like chicks, and our chicks look like dykes

321
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,260
Cause emo is one step below transvestite

322
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,260
Stop my breathing and slit my throat

323
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,260
I must be emo, I don't jump around when I go to shows

324
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,260
I must be emo, I'm dark and sensitive with low self-esteem

325
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,260
The way I dress makes every day feel like Halloween

326
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,260
I have no real problems but I like to make believe I stole my sister's mascara

327
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,260
Now I'm grounded for a week, sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies

328
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,700
I can't get through a Hawthorne Heights album without sobbing

329
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,140
Girls keep breaking up with me, it's never any fun

330
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,060
They say they already have a pussy, they don't need another one

331
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,980
Stop my breathing and slit my throat

332
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:16,180
I must be emo, I don't jump around when I go to shows

333
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,340
I must be emo, dyeing my hair and polish on my toes

334
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,460
I must be emo, I play guitar and write suicide notes

335
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:34,780
must be emo my life is just a black abyss you know it's so dark and suffocating me grabbing a

336
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,220
hold of me and tightening its grip tighter than a pair of my little sister's jeans which look great

337
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:48,380
on me by the way when i get to all right that was uh song number one tonight's cage match last

338
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,980
week's winner adam and andrew with emo kid a nice long two minute clip for you guys uh will it win

339
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,940
tonight it's up to you guys in chat but you can't vote until all three songs

340
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:05,340
have played and the second song tonight is my pick me me me and I picked a song

341
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,740
by a band that I like a little trancey band called Phragma and the song I

342
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,900
picked tonight is called radio waves which I think is appropriate and I just

343
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,580
downloaded some random trance compilation and this is on it and I

344
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:25,580
I figured you guys needed a good, uh, trancy song, so here it is, Pragma, Radio Wave, song number two, enjoy.

345
00:21:48,580 --> 00:22:17,580
You take me back to the familiar

346
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:35,260
There's no way back, but I still see you I'm searching through forgotten airspace

347
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:49,260
through white noise. You reach out to me. You reach out to me.

348
00:22:49,260 --> 00:23:08,260
Radio waves fill the empty mind Radio waves from the lows and highs

349
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:13,260
Radio waves keep the flame alive

350
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,260
I need love soon

351
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,260
Tryna get home

352
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:33,260
Brains in my mind

353
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:45,260
Brains in my mind

354
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:59,140
Song number two was by Phragma tonight, Radio Waves, let's go around and see what our studio

355
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,140
thought of that.

356
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,940
Remember, our opinions are just that opinions, it's your votes that make the decision.

357
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,820
Andrew, what'd you think?

358
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,820
I like good chopped up type of beat, it doesn't get boring.

359
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,140
Good synth, really meaty bass, I could've used like a little more kick to it in some

360
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:20,820
higher regions but uh all really good really trancy little tune uh really good for ambi

361
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,980
i'd give it a nine that's a really comprehensive review usually get people in here and just go

362
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:34,020
sucked three good job uh low-key okay seven see see what i mean look at what that asshole did

363
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,180
uh me i i like it i think the only problem i have is it gets a little quiet in the middle part and

364
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,540
i'm like oh i'm gonna fall asleep and then oh shit i just woke up like i said could use a little more

365
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,340
tick exactly it could use a little more kick in the butt in the middle uh

366
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,220
he's about cowbell more cowbell would have done good in the middle

367
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,460
eva god do you know how old that saying is i mean seriously i think we

368
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,980
i think you know what i would like to happen is that christopher walken like

369
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,380
goes on the today show or and something it says okay as of today that cowbell

370
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,660
shit is retired stop and that's it people would have to

371
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,540
listen this is christopher walking oh yeah that's all right all right uh nine

372
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,340
from me because i like pragma all right loki what'd you pick tonight

373
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,340
I picked a song

374
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,180
A remix of song that we actually won cage match

375
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,240
Yeah, butch by the way has been in the cage match about four times now under different remixes

376
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:27,100
No, it has not listen. It has not been under in different remixes. It's only been under the cage match once

377
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,620
one time I

378
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,040
This is a remix of pendulum

379
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:39,380
Hold your color. This is the bipolar mix and it's actually quite different how appropriate

380
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:46,180
We have a bipolar song and an emo song in tonight's cage match. Gotta love OLR. It's good. Trust me

381
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,620
It's off their single. So it's pretty cool. All right, here it is

382
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:55,080
You be the judge chat room song number three hold your color the bipolar mix by pendulum enjoyed

383
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:30,620
I will look into your eyes and so will they

384
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:41,620
You try to save yourself, but the circle is complete

385
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:47,620
She hasn't always been so cold

386
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:52,620
Heroes killed at self-control

387
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,620
And being able to breathe

388
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:01,620
Thinking luxury

389
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,620
She's soaking through

390
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,620
To cut against the wall

391
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:15,620
Where they take everything away

392
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:24,620
Put your colors against the wall

393
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,620
Don't leave us awake

394
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:36,620
Time is slipping away

395
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,620
No time to claim damages

396
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,620
With me shouting to space

397
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,620
You looked into your eyes

398
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,620
And saw what we were made of

399
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,620
You tried to save yourself

400
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,420
The circle is complete

401
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,620
You didn't need to go to waste

402
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:22,120
But in a way the change was due

403
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,120
The ship has been destroyed

404
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,120
This is just the water

405
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,120
Soaking through

406
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,880
Hold your colors against the wall

407
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,760
When they take everything away

408
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Hold your colors against the wall

409
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,760
When I don't believe it's your age

410
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Time is slipping away

411
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,760
No time to claim time and trust

412
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,180
Since we're shining through space

413
00:30:38,760 --> 00:31:07,360
Song numero three in tonight's cage match pendulum hold your color

414
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,380
don't hold your votes though what do you think Andrew I liked it kind of had the

415
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,280
kick that Rob's song kind of lacked it was like they couldn't decide on a tempo

416
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:20,740
went from mellow to upbeat to fucking hyper I like it I'll give it a 9.5 half

417
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:26,540
point off because Loki you're a goddamn cheater we love that man to that Loki

418

419
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,740
like the last one I think I give it a 10 because I've been listening to song I

420
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:45,300
love it it is my number two to today but I give that song a nine it would have

421
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,700
been a perfect ten but one point off cuz Loki's a goddamn cheater all right so

422
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,100

00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,680
Bullshit is easy.

446
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
You just never lie.

447
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,060
And if you have one of every card, all you do is never lie.

448
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,060
Alright, alright, alright.

449
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,060
It's a math thing.

450
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,820
Alright, favorite game?

451
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,700
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Milborne.

452
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:32,400
It's a French card game and you're like a car and you gotta go a thousand miles and

453
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:39,460
you have the stop sign or the red light, green light and then you can puncture people's tires.

454
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,700
It's all a card game and I'll tell you what, it's one of my favorite card games I remember

455
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,260
from when I was a kid.

456
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,560
I swear to God I'm not crazy, stop leaving me like that.

457
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,060
Somebody in chat room has got to know what I'm talking about.

458
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,180
Screw that, I'll just play speed.

459
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,220
There was a computer version of it not that long ago.

460
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,220
I need to find that again.

461
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,140
Maybe one of our listeners knows of an abandonware site or something where I can find this because

462
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:04,060
they had a collection it had Racco and Millborn and there was another one what

463
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:10,900
was that other really popular one phase phase 12 I think is one of them I think

464
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,300
there's another one though that's really popular it's like a gin rummy thing okay

465
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,380
I'm looking at chat now okay some people know what I'm talking about there see

466
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:26,380
some people have it there. Okay, well tell us more about Uno on Xbox. Well, I've got

467
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:34,820
actual screenshots of it. Apparently, Xbox Oxide or whatever, Xbox-ide, whatever. Their

468
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:41,560
website, they have, not only that, they have pictures of MotoGP 2006 gameplay. Apparently

469
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:48,700
they were sent some debug ones. But, for our in-studio guests, there's a picture of Uno.

470
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,340
looks cool impressive

471
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,500
I know you actually the play looks like it's a players online

472
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,060
that's cool how can you say that that looks bad I just you're a bad man Loki

473
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,780
when this was come out I

474
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,620
I don't know it doesn't say it's they just have a debug version of it right

475
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,300
now

476
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,140
on live do to do to do

477
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,480
on phase 10 says color soccer that was the

478
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,220
thing I was trying to have a show they're showing some the

479
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,980
achievements Uno, Bluff, Multiplayer, Quick Change Artist, Wild Abandoned, and Ace.

480
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,420
I don't know what the hell those are.

481
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,660
So for you Achievement Point whores, have fun.

482
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,500
Ooh, Color of Sakura linked me to a Millborn game. That's

483
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,820
funny. This is not the same one I'm thinking of, but this will work.

484
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,260
You can change the rules, that's kinda neat.

485
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,980
I don't know, I guess I'd play this, you know.

486
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,640
All the horsepower they have in that system, they're using it to play card games.

514
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,660
What's that? What's Tekken Dark Resurrection? That's the PSP version of Tekken 5.

515
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,060
Oh, okay. That's right. The arcade expansion thing. Why don't you just call it Tekken PSP?

516
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:14,420
Okay, here's what you need to do. Go to PlaySide, www.playsyde.com,

517
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,340
and check out the Ridge Racer 7 scans. And the main one I'm talking about

518
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:23,700
is this picture that they actually have on the little icon for it.

519
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,700
Look at that car and tell me that does not look real.

520
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,300
Because that thing...

521
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,180
I'm sorry, it looks like a real car. I mean, what do you think?

522
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,580
I mean... Ooh, that's sexy. Yeah.

523
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,220
That's like... See, I saw those scans for Ridge Racer 7. It looks pretty sexy.

524
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:45,820
I mean, this stuff's looking a lot better than Ridge Racer 6. I don't know what the hell they did with the Ridge Racer 6, but...

525
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,900
Ah, yeah. It's gonna be sweet.

526
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,740
I don't know. Alright, you wanna know who won tonight's cage match?

527
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,060
We got the votes all tallied up. I'm done. Ready to go.

528
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,640
I don't give much time anymore to vote you get a vote quick I it was very very

529
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,020
close only one vote determine the winner but in the end there could be only one

530
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,660
and it was

531
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,940
hold your collar

532
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,580
which I goes to show me that you all support goddamn cheating

533
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,740
good job whatever who color soccer link me to another

534
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,100
no born PC game the one I'm thinking I've had

535
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,220
other card games in it it wasn't just no born it was like the official mill born

536
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,780
game

537
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,740
and it had Racco and see this is another shareware one

538
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:34,020
good a good start but not the same one I'm thinking of it had Racco and

539
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,220
I think phase 10 and there's some other game I just can't think of the name

540
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,820
all right

541
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,820
we're about ready to get into the chat room FUs of the week I'm just waiting to

542
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,540
get a few

543
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,820
so they're open if you want to send in your FUs of the week send those over

544
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,980
private message

545
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,960
meantime what was the chat room talking about earlier Clerks 2 right when's that movie

546
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,620
supposed to come out

547
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:00,900
I don't remember. It's soon, I know that. I have to admit, I'm not that excited about it.

548
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,580
I love Kevin Smith movies, don't get me wrong, except I didn't really, like Jersey Girl was

549
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:10,260
kind of whatever, but I understand why that movie was made. But, I don't know, my excitement for

550
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:16,420
this movie hasn't been that as great as it should be. Is that a sign that I'm turning 30 soon?

551
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,260
I'm starting to wonder. I'm no longer an angsty 20-something.

552
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,460
August 18th.

553
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,500
August 18th.

554
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,540
I'll go see it because, you know what, I've watched

555
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:30,160
every single Kevin Smith film good or bad and I did watch Jersey girl and I

556
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,600
didn't like Jersey girl but you know what I sat through it and watched it and

557
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:39,280
I will go see this because I love the Clerks movie I love the Clerks cartoon

558
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,960
more the cartoon than the movie but um I think it could be still funny I'm just

559
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,160
worried they're gonna try to pull it off like you know Jane silent Bob Strike

560
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,160
back not so good I mean it was an okay movie but it just wasn't as good as

561
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,760
as edgy as Clerks. It wasn't, you know, smart. Just kind of dumb humor. But, um, I'm all

562
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,480
for the Clerks animated movie, which is supposed to be coming out after Clerks, too. That's

563
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,200
the next thing he's working on. Clerks, Clerks, Clerks. They need to bring that thing back.

564
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:12,860
I mean, if anything, god damn it. This is totally off topic here, but, you know, speaking

565
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,500
of, like, we were talking about G4 earlier, and how they don't really have anything related

566
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:23,620
to video games anymore, I see another network going this way.

567
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,860
And it's really sad.

568
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,900
Cartoon Network is putting reruns of Saved by the Bell on.

569
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,940
No, that's awesome.

570
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,500
You shut up.

571
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,900
That's awesome, because they showed Jesse's song

572
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,980
on Thursday night, which, by the way,

573
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,100
is the episode that is, I'm so excited.

574
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,380
I'm so excited.

575
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,540
All right, all right, it's retro and awesome,

576
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,580
but it's not cartoons.

577
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,540
It's not cartoons.

578
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,540
No, you're right, it's not.

579
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,540
But here's the thing.

580
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,320
of the sh- you know how it usually says Cartoon Network at the very bottom of the screen?

581
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,260
Instead what it said was, um, Crappy 1980s Live Action TV Show Network.

582
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,260
What?

583
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,640
Which I thought was great.

584
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,660
Which is funny because Saved by the Bell, that particular episode was 90 or 91, it wasn't

585
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,660
in the 80s.

586
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,660
Got you.

587
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,660
Serious story.

588
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
Got you.

589
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,660
Whatever.

590
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,060
But anyways, if there's anything, they need to put, you know, the Clerks animated series

591
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,620
on Adult Swim, because that would be perfect.

592
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,620
God damn right.

593
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,420
That they need to bring back Invaders M and put it on Adult Swim as well.

594
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:19,700
like all these 15 minute things and they really need to resurrect a lot of these old shows on

595
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,980
there and i think if you think about it it worked for family guy it worked for futurama what the

596
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,700
hell give it a try with the clerks gk 128 says there's a rumor that cartoon is actually trying

597
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,980
to produce new saved by the bell episodes what like saved by the bell the newer class

598
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:41,220
year three or your that you know get elizabeth berkeley back what the hell she done you know

599
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:46,380
what? Give it a try. And Lark Voorhees! What the hell happened to her? No love for Lark.

600
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:53,220
Unless it takes place in the 80s, fuck it. I don't want to modernize Saved by the Bell.

601
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:59,280
I don't want it. I live through that. I don't want it. I think they should make Saved by

602
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,040
the Bell edgy. What was that one show that was on Fox for a while that had to deal with

603
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,760
the fact faculty you know and stuff I'm where the hell is called now teachers

604
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,200
tiger class says what Cartoon Network needs is to put that old 80s Chuck Norris

605
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,680
cartoon on oh hell yes color of Sakura says they need to bring back freakazoid

606
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,920
which met with yes cheers in the chat room and freakazoid movie live-action

607
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,200
Jim Carrey playing the lead that way the coolest shit ever SSJ 100 Matt says

608
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,240
Adult Swim should stop putting full house and putting fucking clerks on

609
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:38,000
there they have full house on adults with a rude the fuck is that for real I

610
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,840
don't think so better not be I only heard of just save a bell interesting

611
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,480
but how was it gonna laugh are they really gonna have that for a long time

612
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,540
that seems like one of those things like you know what Eric recently they're

613
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:55,120
airing like all the big episodes they're not airing everything I don't think I

614
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:00,400
don't know cuz Jesse's song was just a song had the music video in it too it's

615
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,640
great episode. It's quality television. I t-voted, I swear to God.

616
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,240
If they want to play something at like three in the morning that's like you know

617
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,460
just like the eighties no live-action TV show hour that's fine they can do that

618
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,820
but don't go with G4's doing this.

619
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:21,040
Haha, Ichiban Crush says in chat, Saved by the Bell is only gonna be on Adult Swim for

620
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:21,620
two weeks.

621
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,660
Okay well that's cool. Then they can see they're airing all the

622
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,020
memorable episodes and then they can go to a different crappy 80's show. I think

623
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:29,900
that's cool.

624
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,660
I'm sorry. Okay that's fine then, but the whole thing is

625
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,200
I don't like what they're doing G4. I'm just like

626
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,680
who the hell is directing? I mean seriously someone needs to go, okay um

627
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,160
yeah G4 is supposed to be TV um

628
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,360
about games um please explain how

629
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,480
Fastlane, Star Trek,

630
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,600
any of the Star Treks, Brainiac,

631
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,800
they sidestepped it. They sidestepped it. It's not TV

632
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,440
About games. Yeah, they're not...

633
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
It's TV for gamers.

634
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,440
Yeah, and it's not really games, they've kind of admitted it's not really about games anymore.

635
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,740
Not all gamers watch Star Trek, most of us do.

636
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,540
Plus, didn't you see the press release this week that they hired Howard Stern's girlfriend

637
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,120
to be the new host to Filter?

638
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,120
I thought that show failed.

639
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,120
And it's not gonna be...

640
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,940
Well because they're bringing it back and it's not about gaming topics, and they're

641
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,940
gonna be...

642
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,000
Icons is now no longer...

643
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,560
It wasn't about gaming topics when it was a...

644
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,660
Icons is no longer gonna be about gaming topics, it's gonna be about like JJ Abrams, and those,

645
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:32,320
those like who's the guy that did X-Men Brian Singer and all that stuff and what was the

646
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:38,640
other thing something about Attack of the Show being retooled so they're adding another

647
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:45,640
co-host to it yeah who is not even a game type person so well most of them weren't anyway

648
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,320
I feel sorry by the way Dark Knight wants you to know that the Chuck Norris cartoon

649
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:55,560
show comes on at 5 45 a.m. well that's awesome what channel I guess Cartoon Network Chuck

650
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,560
Norris wants you to get up early to watch the show.

651
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,560
Well, let me put it this way, okay?

652
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,560
I just feel sorry for the G4 TV staff members that are there.

653
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,560
They're still staying there and kind of going through this transition.

654
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,560
I mean, it's kind of lame.

655
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,560
I'm still pissed when they ate up tech TV.

656
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,560
I'm still sore over that.

657
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,560
Well, you know, that's why we like getting to work with Scott Rubin as limited as we do.

658
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,560
Hell yeah.

659
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,560
Because we get to work with someone who jumped ship before it all went downhill.

660
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,920
That's how we know he's a smart man. He got he got off that sink and sink and ship before

661
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,760
It hit rock bottom. I just I don't I

662
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,160
Don't get it all right now. I'm a gamer and I don't get it. Let's get to F use okay

00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,520
F you to Girl Scouts for selling amazing cookies at such a high price.

668
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,400

669
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,160

Where's my era?

674
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,800
Good cool fat mix.

675
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,760
I think I remember something from the Rob Roberts show, I have to check out this link.

676
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,840
I'm supposed to send him an MP3 and I haven't.

677
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,840

00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:36,880
Let's check this out here, I gotta, God, oh, I wanna, control V, come on.

681
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,320
In which Rob gets completely whipped by his fans.

682
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,080

What was song number two that lost by one vote?

688
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,080
It was the emo kid song.

689
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,080
And then the other one was only two votes fine.

00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,080

to Nintendo of Japan for actually making the game.

693
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,080
If you lose a sock, don't lose hope yet.

694
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,080
If it's not announced at E3,

695
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,080

696
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,080

718
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,940
They're trying to help they're in negotiations with Konami to get a replacement act

719
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,900
Wow, that's a big old no Jesus Christ I

ColorOfSakuras says Konami is giving that arcade a supernova machine. That's very nice.

745
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:59,880
Speaking of which, we forgot to mention that Konami is going to have two supernova machines close to the final at E3.

746
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,880
Which will be fun to play and film.

747
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,880
And record any audio from said machines.

748
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,880
Hmm

749
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:13,580
We'll see they are we're already on Konami shitless though aren't we no no

750
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,280
Whatever take me whatever they got attention. That's right

751
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:25,300
It was only what it was only one week before the Nintendo power thing anyway, so when when when yeah, whatever all right?

752
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,160
That's it. We're about ready to close down shop here and

753
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,960
and Rheoma said F you to the people

754
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,880
this is a late one but I think this is interesting F you to the people who

755
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,600
ignored me on my birthday on Wednesday because a gay lesbian silence day

756
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,720
what is gay lesbian silence day?

757
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,040
I am gay and I don't even know about it just like everything else in the gay

758
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,280
circle I'm always the last to know. I think they had this whole high school college

759
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,880
demonstration where people would be silent for a few hours

760
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,940
and I don't know what the hell it was supposed to signify but it was supposed to be some

761
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,580
sort of gay rights thing okay I don't get it either I don't get it that's not

762
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:08,380
being gay most gay people I know are fucking loud I don't know that's you're

763
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:18,020
telling me I only can make fun cuz I am gay whatever all right um I think that's

764
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,820
gonna do it I think we're done with tonight's episode of orange launch radio

765
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,900
we're going a long time here we're damn near on four hours now so I think it's

766
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,580
time for us to stop broadcasting so it's time to go around and get everybody's

767
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,900
final thought. Loki, your final thought?

768
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,700
I have lots of work to do this week and um...

769
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,480
I don't know if I'll see you... Oh!

770
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,840
God! There's one story I forgot!

771
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,000
Sorry, real quick.

772
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,460
There's a Halo 2 mash mix contest going on.

773
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,320
What the fuck's that?

774
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,700
Mash mix? Music?

775
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,340
Oh! Okay.

776
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,260
And I forget the website that was about that.

777
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:54,940
But I thought that was interesting because I might have to enter that, you know, so...

778
00:53:54,940 --> 00:54:07,840
be pretty cool. Basically if you want to check it out, go to h2v2.ggl.com.

779
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,600
Yeah, Ryoma clarified here. They were ignoring people because gays were being ignored or

780
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,600
something like that. When I'm around, I can't be ignored.

781
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,840
Yeah, how hard is it to ignore?

782
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,940
Andrew, your final thought.

783
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,580
I have fury.

784
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:28,860
My final thought is, um, time for me to go play more Final Fantasy XI.

785
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,860
Addict.

786
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:30,860
Shut up.

787
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:31,860
You're not Jamie.

788
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,860
Okay.

789
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:33,860
Okay.

790
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,860
I'm a wow addict.

791
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,860
I have no room to talk.

792
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,740
Remember kids, no live show next week, but tune into the podcast stream.

793
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,860
When you next hear Loki, he will be a married man.

794
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,860
Sucker.

795
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:48,620
I will be the only unmarried OLR host.

796
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,380
How sad.

797
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,480
And since, you know, with the laws being the way they are, I won't be getting married for

798
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,480
a while.

799
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,480
Womp womp womp.

800
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,480
Unless I move to Massachusetts.

801
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,480
Oh well.

802
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,480
Who cares?

803
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,480
Oh well, you're not a sucker, right?

804
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,120
Hey, it just gives me the right to be bitter.

805
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:09,680
So when I'm especially bitter on the show, I can just go, hey, it's because I'm not married.

806
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,900

about 15 seconds to resume oh shit I almost forgot the fortune cookie message

818
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:54,580
of the day. Shit! It's because Dark Soccer is not here to give me the death stare. Here

819
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:58,580
it is, your fortune cookie message of the day, which I almost forgot. Damn me.

820
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:04,220
This is a special moment right now. We'd like to take this time to tell all the kids at

821
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:07,220
home, send your parents out of the room. This is a kids song.

822
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:13,500
Life's gonna suck when you row up, when you row up, when you row up. Life's gonna suck

823
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:18,500
when you row up. It sucks pretty bad right now. Hey, if you know the words, sing along

824
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:23,880
You're going to have to mow the lawn. Do the dishes. Make your bed. You're going to

825
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:29,160
have to go to school until you are 17. It's going to seem like 3 times as long as that.

826
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:35,140
You might have to go to war. Shoot a gun. Kill a nun. You might have to go to war when

827
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:40,460
you get out of school. Eight sure up, kids. It gets a lot worse. You're going to have

828
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:45,260
to deal with stress. Deal with stress. Deal with stress. You're going to be a giant mess

829
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,260
When you get back from the war

830
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,760
Santa Claus does not exist and there's no Easter Bunny

831
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,260
You'll find out when you grow up that Brikford isn't funny

832
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,760
Bunny Bunny!

833
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,260
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

834
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,260
Life's gonna suck when you grow up

835
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,260
When you grow up, when you grow up

836
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,760
Life's gonna suck when you grow up

837
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,760
It sucks pretty bad right now

838
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,760
You're gonna end up smoking crack

839
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,760
On your back, face the back

840
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,260
You're gonna end up hooked on smack

841
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,260
And then you're gonna die

842
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,280
And then you're gonna die

843
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,820
Time for the kids

844
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,820
Dark soccer is a damn dirty cheater too. That that song was just in like four weeks ago, I think

845
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:43,940
Oh well. Oh well. No, it was in last week's pre-show, that's why it sounds like it was

846
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,460
just, it was in last week's pre-show, but it wasn't a fortune cookie, but it was a fortune

847
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,860
cookie not that long ago. And the moral of the story is, it pays to cheat. You know what,

848
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:53,540
that's one of my favorite fortune cookie messages anyway, so I don't care. I'll play that every

849
00:57:53,540 --> 00:58:01,020
week if you kids don't shut up. Just kidding. Love ya. Have a great night everybody, and
