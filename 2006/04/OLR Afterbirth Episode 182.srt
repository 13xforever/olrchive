1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:01,910
[SPEAKER_03]: who syndicates our show weekly.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,190
[SPEAKER_03]: We also let them have a crack at this little live segment.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:11,632
[SPEAKER_03]: So tonight we thought, okay, we're not going to be having a live show next week because Loki's getting married, right, Loki?

4
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:12,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

5
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:12,473
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

6
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:17,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought, and we have a lot of chatters who wants to know, who is Loki getting married to?

7
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:20,775
[SPEAKER_03]: So we asked her to sit in for a little bit so we could say hello.

8
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:22,055
[SPEAKER_03]: So please say hello to Nellie.

9
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:23,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everybody.

10
00:00:23,596 --> 00:00:24,136
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

11
00:00:24,396 --> 00:00:24,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing good.

12
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:27,537
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're getting married to Loki next week, correct?

13
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:28,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly enough, yes.

14
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you say sadly enough?

15
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:31,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

16
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:32,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly for him.

17
00:00:33,523 --> 00:00:33,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

18
00:00:34,043 --> 00:00:36,385
[SPEAKER_03]: First thing they wanted to know, are you into video games at all?

19
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:37,926
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

20
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:38,967
[SPEAKER_03]: No, why not?

21
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're boring.

22
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think they take away from cuddle time or...

23
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,994
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have a pretty rigid regime in the house where he can't play him when I'm there.

24
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:53,615
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't know.

25
00:00:54,816 --> 00:00:58,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, like, I don't understand the fascination.

26
00:00:58,538 --> 00:00:58,919
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't?

27
00:00:59,079 --> 00:00:59,239
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

28
00:00:59,259 --> 00:00:59,779
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

29
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:01,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know how to use the buttons.

30
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:03,662
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you into?

31
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:05,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Porn.

32
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:08,165
[SPEAKER_05]: As you've told everybody already.

33
00:01:08,205 --> 00:01:09,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just teasing, though.

34
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:10,967
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to say that just because I said that.

35
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:11,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you really into porn?

36
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

37
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:14,032
[SPEAKER_03]: And what kind of porn do you like?

38
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:15,674
[SPEAKER_05]: All kinds.

39
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:16,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well that's cool.

40
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:18,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Dog porn.

41
00:01:19,098 --> 00:01:21,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not a single... You don't like dog porn?

42
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:25,004
[SPEAKER_03]: She's just trying to make yourself sound freaky because you're marrying her.

43
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:27,026
[SPEAKER_05]: How long have you and Matt been together?

44
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:29,850
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be five years in July.

45
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So what made you choose the 30th for your wedding date of April?

46
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:34,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, random.

47
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just throw a dart at the calendar and that's what you got?

48
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, actually, sort of.

49
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I opened the calendar and I pointed my finger and there it was.

50
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:42,715
[SPEAKER_03]: How did he propose?

51
00:01:44,076 --> 00:01:44,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say.

52
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:48,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It was that awful.

53
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:49,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

54
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,520
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

55
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,402
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was a lack of clothing at the time.

56
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:54,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew!

57
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:56,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh God, I gotta wash my brain, I gotta wash my brain.

58
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:57,973
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't that bad, it was very sweet.

59
00:01:58,053 --> 00:01:59,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I was Loki's roommate at the time.

60
00:01:59,893 --> 00:02:00,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you were.

61
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:04,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you were probably like right outside too, like with your computer.

62
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:06,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing video games.

63
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:07,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Masturbating, I don't know.

64
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:07,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, maybe, I don't know.

65
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:09,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

66
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:11,618
[SPEAKER_03]: What else was I going to ask you?

67
00:02:12,558 --> 00:02:15,599
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's going to E3, like a couple weeks after the wedding.

68
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:16,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, bastard.

69
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And does that piss you off?

70
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,221
[SPEAKER_05]: We've come to an agreement about it.

71
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:21,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what's the agreement?

72
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:22,523
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets to go to E3.

73
00:02:22,603 --> 00:02:23,764
[SPEAKER_05]: And he gets me a present.

74
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:27,306
[SPEAKER_03]: But what if he brings back a t-shirt?

75
00:02:28,227 --> 00:02:30,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he's going to be in trouble.

76
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,291
[SPEAKER_05]: No, anything he'll bring me, I will love because I love him.

77
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:36,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And he basically lets me have whatever I want anytime I want.

78
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:38,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's about time I gave something back.

79
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:40,116
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it that you see in Loki?

80
00:02:40,136 --> 00:02:42,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of our listeners think he's a dick.

81
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:43,939
[SPEAKER_05]: They're fucking dicks.

82
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:46,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

83
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:47,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody loves Loki.

84
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:48,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

85
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:50,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll kick some ass.

86
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for the Apple fans.

87
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:53,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use computers now?

88
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,681
[SPEAKER_05]: A computer?

89
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:59,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know you're not that big a retard.

90
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:02,164
[SPEAKER_02]: She likes those stupid, pretty computers.

91
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:04,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh, the Apples.

92
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,345
[SPEAKER_05]: They're so pretty.

93
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:06,326
[SPEAKER_05]: So you like Apples?

94
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:07,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Only because they're cute.

95
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:09,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to do anything on it.

96
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:13,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I just need to be able to access my email, look up porn, of course.

97
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's about it.

98
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:22,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the first day I had this laptop, I freaking couldn't even work on it at work because I had to go in a conference room to remove the porn that she put on the backdrop.

99
00:03:23,064 --> 00:03:23,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm funny, shut up.

100
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:26,448
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

101
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:32,776
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like this giant vagina and the girl didn't even do a good job waxing because you could see the little hairs growing back.

102
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:33,417
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so funny.

103
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:36,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I got a bleach in my brain.

104
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:37,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

105
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:40,386
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why we don't podcast this little bonus segment here.

106
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:42,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I actually did that during the show.

107
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:43,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

108
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:47,249
[SPEAKER_03]: The week he got that laptop, the first thing you did was started putting porn on it.

109
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:47,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

110
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was asking if you want a gay porn site so you could use.

111
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just trying to save him some time.

112
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:56,054
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of work do you do for a living?

113
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:58,135
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to tell us where, but what kind of work?

114
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I talk on the phone and yell at dumbasses all day.

115
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:00,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

116
00:04:00,877 --> 00:04:03,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever had any really annoying customers you just got to yell at completely?

117
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:05,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't yell at customers.

118
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:09,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I yell at notaries, and every notary is an idiot, pretty much.

119
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:10,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

120
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:11,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any funny stories.

121
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:12,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have prepared better.

122
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:13,387
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

123
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:14,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you came on here last minute.

124
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:15,527
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a good sport.

125
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:17,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see the shirt we got him last week?

126
00:04:17,368 --> 00:04:17,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's funny.

127
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:18,548
[SPEAKER_05]: He wore it to work.

128
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:19,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he?

129
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:20,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

130
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:21,089
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

131
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:23,690
[SPEAKER_03]: We just want to make sure you weren't going to be offended by it, but I knew you.

132
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Game over.

133
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:26,811
[SPEAKER_03]: You know it's totally true.

134
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:28,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

135
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:29,992
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done for.

136
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,552
[SPEAKER_03]: The chatroom is saying Loki's whipped.

137
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:34,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this true?

138
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:36,359
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

139
00:04:38,442 --> 00:04:41,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, sometimes I wish we were a TV show.

140
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:43,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, plug my Myspace thing.

141
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:47,330
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a picture of how whipped he is, I guess.

142
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:47,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it?

143
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so you're in the top eight on our Myspace, I believe.

144
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:50,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

145
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:52,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't we move you in there?

146
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:52,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we did.

147
00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:56,818
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you go over to Myspace.com slash Orange Launch Radio, Nellie is in our top eight, I believe.

148
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe we put her in there.

149
00:04:57,719 --> 00:04:58,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

150
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,320
[SPEAKER_03]: So check it out.

151
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:04,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And they want to know what Loki's shirt in the video you just put up on OLRPSP.com says.

152
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:08,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a groom, I'm doomed, show me your hooters Did you see the little buttons, Nelly, too, that we had?

153
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:11,887
[SPEAKER_02]: The little bachelor party in progress, the little light-up titties?

154
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:29,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, those are cool.

155
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:31,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Those lit up for a really long time.

156
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:32,554
[SPEAKER_05]: The next day they were still flashing.

157
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:33,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine never flashed, ever.

158
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:35,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I knew I was gay.

159
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So, who planned the wedding?

160
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,820
[SPEAKER_03]: You or Loki?

161
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:41,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Me.

162
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I should let them plan a wedding.

163
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:47,556
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be like all computer party wedding.

164
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:48,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shut up.

165
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:49,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

166
00:05:49,998 --> 00:05:50,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games.

167
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,661
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I went to a wedding where they had Halo at the reception.

168
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:54,441
[SPEAKER_03]: A Halo wedding cake?

169
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a Halo wedding cake and a reception with Halo.

170
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you guess who that was?

171
00:05:58,485 --> 00:05:58,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait.

172
00:05:59,005 --> 00:05:59,866
[SPEAKER_05]: A friend of yours.

173
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:02,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

174
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:03,308
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a friend of the show.

175
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:04,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

176
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:05,550
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

177
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,990
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll tell you.

178
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:06,851
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk more about it later.

179
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:10,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there was anything else I was going to ask you.

180
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else I should ask her about?

181
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:13,202
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

182
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:40,391
[SPEAKER_05]: My co-worker Idrine, who knows my taste, she got me this video.

183
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:43,274
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called, I Walk a Mile to See Some Camel Toe.

184
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:48,881
[SPEAKER_05]: And we watched it, and my boss watched it, and so now everybody knows I'm weird.

185
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, can we put that on our website?

186
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:51,204
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

187
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,226
[SPEAKER_03]: The video?

188
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,207
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to.

189
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:57,052
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I going to say?

190
00:06:57,972 --> 00:07:02,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, somebody was saying here, somebody wanted to know your boob size, but you don't have to tell them that.

191
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:03,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you make it up.

192
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:05,176
[SPEAKER_05]: They kind of vary.

193
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:10,119
[SPEAKER_05]: If I gain weight, it's a D. If I lose weight, it's a C. Right now, I'm fat, so...

194
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:14,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so hot I know, I'm going to bed too I know

195
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, Rob's in the wedding.

196
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't I have to subject myself to Jewish traditions for the wedding?

197
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:38,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you do.

198
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:40,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're a little yarmulke.

199
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:40,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up, Matt.

200
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:43,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're Jewish, right?

201
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm a Jew.

202
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, that's not a problem.

203
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:47,731
[SPEAKER_03]: We have listeners that are Jewish.

204
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:48,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a Jew gold.

205
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:51,572
[SPEAKER_05]: After we're married, I shall show Matt where I stash it.

206
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:54,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you see, you like South Park.

207
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:55,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

208
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:55,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there you go.

209
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:56,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boy.

210
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:57,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Too hot for podcasts.

211
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:57,836
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

212
00:07:57,876 --> 00:08:01,019
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I will only subject myself to such, you know, religious traditions.

213
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:03,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one, I've never met a Jewish person I didn't like.

214
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:03,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

215
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:05,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never met a Jewish person I didn't like.

216
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:07,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I can show you a few.

217
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:07,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

218
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:09,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably meet some at the wedding, you know.

219
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:09,607
Ha!

220
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:11,609
Yeah.

221
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:15,912
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'm willing to try new and interesting things.

222
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:16,353
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be fun.

223
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:19,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're all kosher.

224
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:20,429
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

225
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,410
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

226
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,891
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about games.

227
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:26,774
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything you want to say to our listeners, our hundreds of thousands of listeners, listen to us.

228
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:27,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, listeners.

229
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:28,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a life.

230
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:29,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

231
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:34,707
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Nelly, everybody.

232
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:36,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's fiance, the lucky gal.

233
00:08:36,468 --> 00:08:37,789
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's shut the door.

234
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:39,229
[SPEAKER_03]: New listeners in chat tonight.

235
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:40,450
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate that, you guys.

236
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for tuning in and supporting us.

237
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:44,751
[SPEAKER_03]: It must be working.

238
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,212
[SPEAKER_03]: People must really be telling their friends.

239
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:50,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe it could have been that story, too, that got a little bit of publicity a couple weeks ago.

240
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:52,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if we got anybody through that.

241
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:52,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

242
00:08:53,826 --> 00:09:00,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people actually probably ignored that.

243
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:02,914
[SPEAKER_02]: There was only one site that actually mentioned us.

244
00:09:03,395 --> 00:09:04,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not really mentioned us.

245
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:10,321
[SPEAKER_02]: They mentioned a site that stole the story from another site that stole the story from another site about

246
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:12,466
[SPEAKER_02]: The story being correct.

247
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,607
[SPEAKER_02]: When the whole Castlevania thing came out.

248
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:15,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.

249
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:23,031
[SPEAKER_03]: When the Nintendo Power confirmed the Castlevania thing, nobody said, oh, I guess this proves Orange Lounge Radio's story is true.

250
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:28,074
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's how it works, is that people don't care where the news originally came from.

251
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,515
[SPEAKER_02]: So why stop caring, too?

252
00:09:30,731 --> 00:09:31,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll see.

253
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:32,293
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

254
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:36,438
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to just make announcements on the air only so that only our listeners get to hear it from now on.

255
00:09:36,698 --> 00:09:38,900
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done that before and everyone ignores it.

256
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,461
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

257
00:09:40,302 --> 00:09:40,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, who cares?

258
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:41,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Our listeners found out.

259
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:42,645
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the important thing.

260
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:43,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was just me.

261
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:46,429
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't give a shit about other people.

262
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:46,709
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

263
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,411
[SPEAKER_11]: I seem to have an entourage of newbies.

264
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:49,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it was just me.

265
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:50,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

266
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:50,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

267
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go around.

268
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:54,566
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the afterbirth portion of the show.

269
00:09:54,886 --> 00:10:05,948
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't podcast this because, you know, we talk, maybe we talk a little bit about games, but, you know, we talk about us and, you know, what we've been up to and just a way for our fans to connect with us over the past few years.

270
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:18,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we used to do this show for three hours when it was the Balmani show, but if you actually listened back then, you know it would be about 30 minutes of Balmani and then two and a half hours of, you know, fucking around.

271
00:10:19,812 --> 00:10:22,454
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a train wreck, but it was THE train wreck.

272
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:25,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was a train wreck everybody was buying tickets for.

273
00:10:26,038 --> 00:10:28,380
[SPEAKER_03]: At least, you know, all three of you that listen regularly.

274
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:29,502
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your week?

275
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:30,142
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

276
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:31,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Magus!

277
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:33,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, my week, my day.

278
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:40,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, my week, high point of the week was going down to Dave & Buster's for a very special birthday.

279
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:42,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Not mine this time, though.

280
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:50,363
[SPEAKER_11]: And a little bit of pet peeve about that, they card everyone who goes in, and me, I'm almost 21, almost.

281
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:52,825
[SPEAKER_11]: They card me, I can't get in.

282
00:10:54,346 --> 00:11:01,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Until, uh, the special birthday guest comes on in, and, uh, says, oh, oh, oh, he's with me.

283
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:10,957
[SPEAKER_11]: But, uh, little thing about Dave & Buster, Dave & Buster's is awesome, if you haven't been there, it's, Rob put it best one time as, uh, Chuck E. Cheese for Grown Ups.

284
00:11:11,781 --> 00:11:14,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Or I also say it's a Las Vegas hotel without gambling.

285
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:20,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, pseudo-gambling, you have like the, uh... Okay, gambling for children, the tickets thing.

286
00:11:20,787 --> 00:11:21,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, tickets.

287
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:26,911
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can get all sorts of shit there, and just all the machines they have are just pristine.

288
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:38,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Aside from that, I haven't really been doing much lurking game facts a bit, getting some World of Warcraft, trying to get my character up a couple honor ranks.

289
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:39,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

290
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,000
[SPEAKER_03]: What level is your character in WoW?

291
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Currently 56, almost 57.

292
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:48,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Orc Rogue on Maelstrom.

293
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:49,843
[SPEAKER_11]: That's RP PvP.

294
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:51,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Emphasis on RP.

295
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:52,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Maelstrom.

296
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if that's the same one he plays on.

297
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:55,625
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but it's not PvP.

298
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:56,906
[SPEAKER_03]: His isn't PvP, I don't think.

299
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,347
[SPEAKER_03]: He plays on Malfurion.

300
00:11:58,447 --> 00:11:59,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Malfurion, yeah.

301
00:11:59,127 --> 00:11:59,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Very close name.

302
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:00,649
[SPEAKER_11]: It's PVE.

303
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:01,970
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the newer PVE servers.

304
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,432
[SPEAKER_03]: He's 60 on Malfurion.

305
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Extifer is what we keep pointing to, my roommate.

306
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:09,115
[SPEAKER_03]: But I stopped playing World of Warcraft.

307
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:10,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my highest character was like 25.

308
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:12,298
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't play very much.

309
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:14,980
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of sad, and I'm kind of ashamed of it.

310
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:23,386
[SPEAKER_11]: I started on Maelstrom on the day Maelstrom was launched, the day RPPVP servers were launched.

311
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:24,687
[SPEAKER_11]: I started my character.

312
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:25,508
[SPEAKER_11]: I started Kroth.

313
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:26,289
[SPEAKER_11]: I started that rogue.

314
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:32,648
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's been about six months since the server came out and I'm just now getting to 60.

315
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:34,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

316
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:35,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know what?

317
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:36,490
[SPEAKER_11]: That's okay.

318
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop and smell the steel bloom.

319
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Final Fantasy XI for two years and never got a character to 75.

320
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:44,434
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, my highest level is 55, which is like nothing.

321
00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:45,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

322
00:12:45,435 --> 00:12:51,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Like right before I quit, I was finally doing Genkai 1, which is the break the limit for 50.

323
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm a slow player.

324
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:58,547
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I'm making better progress the second time around on my new server.

325
00:12:58,907 --> 00:12:59,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having a good time.

326
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:04,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I gave Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 a negative review, I'm still playing it on Xbox 360.

327
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:07,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I do like getting to sit my fat ass on the couch and play.

328
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:10,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think a lot of people are really going to be turned off by the whole front end stuff.

329
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:12,699
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't want to feel like you wasted the money on it?

330
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:13,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

331
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's part of it too.

332
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:17,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to feel like my money's wasted.

333
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:19,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anything else?

334
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:20,425
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's about it.

335
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:21,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your week?

336
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:22,406
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

337
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:24,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

338
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:26,704
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

339
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:54,295
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's just because at the end, you know, everybody's submitting their stuff last minute.

340
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:54,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

341
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:56,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I get something tomorrow or I'm going to cry.

342
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:59,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just, yeah, be patient.

343
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:12,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing, like, business cards and stuff, website stuff, and just, I don't know, getting ready for everything.

344
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, I got kind of a surprise.

345
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:16,519
[SPEAKER_02]: My coworker

346
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:19,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically enough, one I don't like too much.

347
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:22,811
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently she has her good streaks now and then.

348
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:24,653
[SPEAKER_02]: She's all, so you're on the A3?

349
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:25,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah.

350
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:28,078
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's all, well, um...

351
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:31,586
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura and I want to go to that too.

352
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:53,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go to Sony, too.

353
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:54,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

354
00:14:54,157 --> 00:14:54,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Hook me up.

355
00:14:54,717 --> 00:14:55,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Hook a brother up.

356
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:59,578
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a hell of a time getting me in, and they don't have any extra passes.

357
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:01,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you know, it would be no problem.

358
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,179
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, probably next year will be a little different story.

359
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:11,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking forward to it because I cannot wait, you know, to try it, the revolution stuff.

360
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:14,302
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it should be awesome.

361
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:20,480
[SPEAKER_03]: My day and my week were okay, as I mentioned before.

362
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I've kind of talked about a lot of it already, because of course I went to DarkSakura's birthday thing yesterday at Dave & Buster's and watched her drink a little bit.

363
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:32,872
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, just so you guys know what I got her for her birthday, I got her a thing of Patron, the tequila she really likes.

364
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,774
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't cheap, let me put it that way.

365
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:37,756
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's hers.

366
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:39,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, what else did I do?

367
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

368
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:03,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Scary stuff.

369
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:06,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just booked our hotel, finally, too.

370
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:13,132
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be not that far from the E3 Outpost, because we're going to be doing stuff with our buddies over there at allgames.com, which should be fun.

371
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:16,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is open to the public all but Wednesday night.

372
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:22,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all the other days it's open to the public, so you can come down to the E3 Outpost, and they're going to be doing games and all that good stuff.

373
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:27,061
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically, it's kind of like a cyber cafe from what I understand, but it's consoles.

374
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:28,242
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can rent consoles.

375
00:16:28,262 --> 00:16:37,829
[SPEAKER_03]: They have like HDTVs and Scott Rubin who used to be with G4TV.com and his buddy Lawrence, they do a show there every day over at AllGames.com.

376
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,551
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to be doing that for E3 as well.

377
00:16:39,571 --> 00:16:44,054
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be doing something I don't know, with our buddy Bobby who also does a show over there.

378
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:44,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be fun!

379
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:48,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see.

380
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:49,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we get into Cage Match?

381
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys have anything you want to talk about?

382
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:51,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything random?

383
00:16:51,472 --> 00:16:52,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have an agenda for tonight.

384
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:53,834
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't come up with anything, so.

385
00:16:53,995 --> 00:17:01,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been actually working on that, because, okay, I'm trying to, my stupid laptop, now, granted, I know everyone's like, you don't even got a Mac.

386
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:03,164
[SPEAKER_02]: No, listen, I want to do stuff with my laptop.

387
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:09,106
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, the whole problem was I found out the reason why my laptop was crashing is because the RAM I had apparently was bad.

388
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:14,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had a gig stick in here that I bought for $100 or whatever.

389
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:16,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at it.

390
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you know, this already has a gig in it.

391
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And upgrading it only to a gig and a half for $100 isn't really a great deal.

392
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:28,712
[SPEAKER_02]: So I turned around, took that money that I got from the gig stick, bought a minidisc player.

393
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:34,657
[SPEAKER_02]: for recording audio interviews and wireless mics to go with that.

394
00:17:34,877 --> 00:17:35,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool.

395
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:39,742
[SPEAKER_02]: But on top of that, I've been trying to get my computer to network my computer at home.

396
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:40,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It networks fine with this one.

397
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:49,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I just fucked it up about a second ago when I said disable the wireless connection because I was trying to change the network because it wasn't seeing you.

398
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:52,593
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, hopefully now it's working.

399
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:54,475
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not because Windows sucks.

400
00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:55,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job!

401
00:17:57,018 --> 00:17:59,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, my cage match is on the internet and you need to download it.

402
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:04,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then I guess we should get into tonight's cage match, shouldn't we?

403
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:05,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So, cue the music.

404
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember to participate in the cage match.

405
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:12,109
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be in chat.

406
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,210
[SPEAKER_03]: www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

407
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:14,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat.

408
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:20,173
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the cage match works, since we have some noobs tonight, we're going to play three songs for you guys.

409
00:18:20,193 --> 00:18:23,234
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear a clip of last week's winner and then two new songs.

410
00:18:23,614 --> 00:18:29,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And the winning song goes into our regular rotation over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com all week long until we claim another winner.

411
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:34,098
[SPEAKER_03]: So starting off tonight, DarkSakura's pick won last week.

412
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:36,339
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys like the emo song.

413
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:37,921
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the winner.

414
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:40,965
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Adam and Andrew was the artist and it was Emo Kid.

415
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:43,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen this on a lot of my spaces.

416
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:44,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe some of you guys have heard this before.

417
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:47,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is a clip of song number one you can vote for tonight.

418
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:49,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam and Andrew with Emo Kid.

419
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Mood apathetic.

420
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:54,424
[SPEAKER_01]: My life is spiraled outward.

421
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:58,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't get enough money to go to the Blood Red Romance and Suffocate Me Dry concert.

422
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:06,955
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks cause they play some of my favorite songs like Stab My Heart Because I Love You and Rip Apart My Soul and of course Stabby Rip Stab Stab.

423
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:10,238
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't help that I couldn't get my hair to that flippy thing either.

424
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that guy from that band can do.

425
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:13,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Some days, you know.

426
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:38,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm almost emo enough to start shaving my legs Cause I feel real deep when I'm dressing in drag I call it freedom of expression, let's just call me a fag Cause our dudes look like chicks and our chicks look like dykes Cause emo is one step below transvestite Stop my breathing and slit my throat

427
00:19:45,199 --> 00:20:14,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I must be emo I'm dark and sensitive with low self-esteem The way I dress makes every day feel like Halloween I have no real problems but I like to make believe I stole my sister's mascara, now I'm grounded for a week Sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies I can't get through a Hawthorne Heights album without sobbing Girls keep breaking up with me It's never any fun, they say they already have a pussy They don't need another one Stop my breathing and slit my throat I must be emo I don't jump around when I go to shows

428
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:31,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I must be emo, dyeing my hair and polish on my toes I must be emo, I play guitar and write suicide notes I must be emo My life is just a black abyss, you know?

429
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:40,960
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so dark, and it's suffocating me Grabbing a hold of me and tightening its grip Tighter than a pair of my little sister's jeans Which look great on me, by the way

430
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:48,175
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that was song number one tonight's cage match.

431
00:20:48,235 --> 00:20:50,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week's winner, Adam and Andrew with Emo Kid.

432
00:20:51,256 --> 00:20:53,337
[SPEAKER_03]: A nice long two-minute clip for you guys.

433
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:54,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Will it win tonight?

434
00:20:55,198 --> 00:21:00,860
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up to you guys in chat, but you can't vote until all three songs have played.

435
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second song tonight is my pick, Me, Me, Me.

436
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:09,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And I picked a song by a band that I like, a little trancy band called Phragma.

437
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:14,685
[SPEAKER_03]: And the song I picked tonight is called Radio Waves, which I think is appropriate.

438
00:21:15,485 --> 00:21:22,270
[SPEAKER_03]: and I just downloaded some random trance compilation and this was on it and I figured you guys needed a good trancy song.

439
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is, Pragma, Radio Wave, song number two.

440
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

441
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:45,823
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no way back, but I still see you I'm searching through, forgotten airspace And through white noise, you reach out to me You reach out to me

442
00:22:55,706 --> 00:23:11,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Radio waves through the empty mind Radio waves through the lows and highs Radio waves keeps the flame alive

443
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,831
Thanks for watching!

444
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:57,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number two was by Fragma tonight, Radio Waves.

445
00:24:57,687 --> 00:24:59,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and see what our studio thought of that.

446
00:25:00,008 --> 00:25:02,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, our opinions are just that, opinions.

447
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:03,770
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your votes that make the decision.

448
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew, what do you think?

449
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,072
[SPEAKER_11]: I like good chopped up type of beat.

450
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:10,553
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't get boring.

451
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:12,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Good synth, really meaty bass.

452
00:25:12,694 --> 00:25:19,538
[SPEAKER_11]: I could have used a little more kick to it in some of the higher regions, but really good, really trance-y little tune.

453
00:25:20,178 --> 00:25:20,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Really good for ambi.

454
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:21,519
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd give it a nine.

455
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:23,480
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a really comprehensive review.

456
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually we get people in here and just go, sucked, three.

457
00:25:28,304 --> 00:25:28,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

458
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:30,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, okay, seven.

459
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:32,268
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

460
00:25:32,408 --> 00:25:32,828
[SPEAKER_03]: See what I mean?

461
00:25:32,848 --> 00:25:33,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at what that asshole did.

462
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Me, I like it.

463
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:40,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the only problem I have with it is it gets a little quiet in the middle part, and I'm like, ooh, I'm going to fall asleep, and then, oh, shit, I just woke up.

464
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:41,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, could have used a little more kick.

465
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:42,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

466
00:25:42,356 --> 00:25:43,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Could have used a little more kick in the butt in the middle.

467
00:25:44,518 --> 00:25:45,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Needs more cowbell.

468
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:47,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, more cowbell would have done good in the middle.

469
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Viva.

470
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:49,600
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

471
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,600
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki, what'd you pick tonight?

472
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:16,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked a song, a remix of a song that we actually won Cage Match.

473
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:20,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, butch, by the way, it's been in the Cage Match about four times now under different remixes.

474
00:26:21,004 --> 00:26:22,245
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it has not.

475
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:25,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, it has not been under in different remixes.

476
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:27,247
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only been under the Cage Match once.

477
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:29,248
[SPEAKER_02]: One time.

478
00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:35,070
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a remix of Pendulum, Hold Your Color.

479
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,852
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the bipolar mix, and it's actually quite different than the original.

480
00:26:38,872 --> 00:26:39,472
[SPEAKER_03]: How appropriate.

481
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:43,034
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a bipolar song and an emo song in tonight's cage match.

482
00:26:43,694 --> 00:26:44,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta love OLR.

483
00:26:44,694 --> 00:26:45,155
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.

484
00:26:45,835 --> 00:26:48,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, it's off their single, so it's pretty cool.

485
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:49,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here it is.

486
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:50,417
[SPEAKER_03]: You be the judge.

487
00:26:50,537 --> 00:26:54,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom, song number three, Hold Your Color, the bipolar mix by Pendulum.

488
00:26:54,699 --> 00:26:55,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

489
00:31:03,615 --> 00:31:07,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number three in tonight's cage match, Pendulum, Hold Your Color.

490
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:09,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hold your votes, though.

491
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,220
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think, Andrew?

492
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:10,841
[SPEAKER_11]: I liked it.

493
00:31:10,861 --> 00:31:13,383
[SPEAKER_11]: It kind of had the kick that Rob's song kind of lacked.

494
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:15,324
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like they couldn't decide on a tempo.

495
00:31:15,344 --> 00:31:17,466
[SPEAKER_11]: It went from mellow to upbeat to fucking hyper.

496
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.

497
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:23,030
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give it a 9.5, half point off, because, Loki, you're a goddamn cheater.

498
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,192
[SPEAKER_11]: We love that about Loki.

499
00:31:25,272 --> 00:31:26,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Amen to that, Loki.

500
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:27,914
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a remix.

501
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Goddamn cheater.

502
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:29,495
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your vote?

503
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:30,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely different song.

504
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:34,109
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it wasn't like the last one I picked.

505
00:31:34,712 --> 00:31:36,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it a 10 because I've been listening to the song.

506
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:37,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

507
00:31:38,174 --> 00:31:43,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I must be emo, I'm dark, insensitive, but low self-esteem The way I dress makes every day feel like Halloween

508
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:08,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And song number two you can vote for tonight, Fragma with Radio Waves.

509
00:32:15,741 --> 00:32:19,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And song number three you can vote for tonight, Pendulum, Hold Your Color, Bipolar Mix.

510
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:30,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Place vote now.

511
00:32:30,501 --> 00:32:33,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

512
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:34,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it now, now, now, now, now.

513
00:32:34,945 --> 00:32:36,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Punch the keys for God's sake.

514
00:32:41,112 --> 00:32:41,532
[SPEAKER_03]: What, Loki?

515
00:32:41,552 --> 00:32:41,812
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you?

516
00:32:41,972 --> 00:32:42,133
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

517
00:32:42,153 --> 00:32:43,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

518
00:32:43,134 --> 00:32:45,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see you make disgusting faces often.

519
00:32:45,636 --> 00:32:47,098
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a lot to shock Loki.

520
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,592
[SPEAKER_02]: They announced another game that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

521
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:52,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Uno.

522
00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:53,634
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

523
00:32:53,854 --> 00:32:54,554
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

524
00:32:54,755 --> 00:32:55,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

525
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:55,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Uno.

526
00:32:56,035 --> 00:32:56,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw you.

527
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw that.

528
00:32:57,537 --> 00:32:58,858
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a fucking chatroom game.

529
00:32:58,898 --> 00:33:00,018
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not an Xbox game.

530
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:00,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck Uno.

531
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:03,561
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what card game needs to come to Xbox Live.

532
00:33:03,601 --> 00:33:05,963
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you know this game, I love you.

533
00:33:06,003 --> 00:33:07,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm waiting for the chatroom to shout it out.

534
00:33:07,624 --> 00:33:08,505
[SPEAKER_03]: It better be bullshit.

535
00:33:08,605 --> 00:33:09,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

536
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:09,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

537
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:10,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bullshit.

538
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:10,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

539
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:10,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Milborn

540
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:38,836
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a French card game, and you're like a car, and you gotta go a thousand miles, and you have the stop sign, or the red light, green light, and then you can puncture people's tires.

541
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:43,358
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all a card game, and I'll tell you what, it's one of my favorite card games I remember from when I was a kid.

542
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:45,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God I'm not crazy.

543
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:46,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop leaving me like that.

544
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody in chat room has got to know what I'm talking about.

545
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw that.

546
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just play speed.

547
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,161
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a computer version of it not that long ago.

548
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:52,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to find that again.

549
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:57,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe one of our listeners knows of like an abandonware site or something where I can find this because they had a collection.

550
00:33:57,304 --> 00:34:03,287
[SPEAKER_03]: It had Rakko and Milbourne and there was another one.

551
00:34:03,947 --> 00:34:05,368
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that other really popular one?

552
00:34:06,228 --> 00:34:09,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Phase 12 I think is one of them.

553
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's another one, though, that's really popular.

554
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:15,037
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a gin rummy thing.

555
00:34:15,117 --> 00:34:16,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm looking at chat now.

556
00:34:16,939 --> 00:34:18,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, some people know what I'm talking about there.

557
00:34:19,242 --> 00:34:20,765
[SPEAKER_03]: See, some people have it there.

558
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, tell us more about Uno on Xbox.

559
00:34:25,972 --> 00:34:27,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've got actual screenshots of it.

560
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:33,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently Xbox Oxide or whatever, Xboxide, whatever.

561
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:41,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Their website, they have not only that, they have pictures of MotoGP 2006 gameplay.

562
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they were sent some debug ones.

563
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,184
[SPEAKER_02]: But for our in-studio guests, there's a picture of it.

564
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:49,585
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks cool!

565
00:34:49,685 --> 00:34:50,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Impressive.

566
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:51,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

567
00:34:51,026 --> 00:34:53,307
[SPEAKER_02]: And you actually get to play it against other players online.

568
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:54,368
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

569
00:34:54,448 --> 00:34:55,809
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you say that that looks bad?

570
00:34:56,349 --> 00:34:57,330
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a bad man, Loki.

571
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:57,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

572
00:34:58,571 --> 00:35:02,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

573
00:35:02,574 --> 00:35:03,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't say.

574
00:35:04,075 --> 00:35:07,298
[SPEAKER_02]: They just have a debug version of it right now on live.

575
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:12,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Phase 10 says Color of Sakura.

576
00:35:12,668 --> 00:35:15,329
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the thing I was trying to think of earlier.

577
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:17,910
[SPEAKER_02]: They are showing some of the achievements.

578
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:22,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Uno, Bluff, Multiplayer, Quick Change Artist, Wild Abandoned, and Ace.

579
00:35:23,012 --> 00:35:23,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the hell those are.

580
00:35:24,473 --> 00:35:26,353
[SPEAKER_02]: So for you achievement point whores, have fun.

581
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:28,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, Color of Sakura linked me to a Millborn game.

582
00:35:28,774 --> 00:35:29,935
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

583
00:35:30,055 --> 00:35:32,156
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not the same one I'm thinking of, but this will work.

584
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:34,056
[SPEAKER_02]: You can change the rules.

585
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:35,637
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

586
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:36,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

587
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'd play this.

588
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:41,659
[SPEAKER_02]: All the horsepower they have in that system, they're using it to play card games.

589
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a waste.

590
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,080
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just the Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

591
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, alright.

592
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

593
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:50,762
[SPEAKER_02]: More power to them for putting games on there.

594
00:35:50,802 --> 00:35:53,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Xbox Live Arcade is supposed to be for shitty little games.

595
00:35:53,743 --> 00:35:54,843
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some good stuff in there.

596
00:35:54,963 --> 00:35:59,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I want some damn Monopoly or Scrabble on Xbox Live Arcade.

597
00:35:59,765 --> 00:36:00,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, here.

598
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:03,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I want old game shows turned into Xbox Live arcades.

599
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:05,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Match Game on Xbox Live.

600
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Remote Control on Xbox Live.

601
00:36:08,981 --> 00:36:10,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Remote Control!

602
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.

603
00:36:14,184 --> 00:36:17,986
[SPEAKER_03]: These shots of... Charum wants a link to what you're looking at, Loki.

604
00:36:18,006 --> 00:36:19,526
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting foamy at the moment.

605
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:20,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy links now.

606
00:36:20,907 --> 00:36:24,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's XboxSide.com.

607
00:36:24,108 --> 00:36:26,069
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually also have PlaySide.com.

608
00:36:26,169 --> 00:36:26,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Same type of thing.

609
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,911
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically a site that has a bunch of media on it.

610
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:31,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will give you the link to the site.

611
00:36:31,212 --> 00:36:31,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Bookmark it.

612
00:36:31,832 --> 00:36:32,852
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good read.

613
00:36:32,992 --> 00:36:37,014
[SPEAKER_02]: You can watch some videos of stuff that you might not even see in other places.

614
00:36:39,235 --> 00:36:39,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

615
00:36:40,136 --> 00:36:40,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Do-do-do.

616
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:44,307
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkResurrection.com

617
00:36:59,295 --> 00:36:59,735
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

618
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:28,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done, ready to go.

619
00:37:57,133 --> 00:37:58,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give them much time anymore to vote.

620
00:37:58,514 --> 00:37:59,155
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta vote quick.

621
00:37:59,555 --> 00:38:01,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, it was very, very close.

622
00:38:01,276 --> 00:38:04,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Only one vote determined the winner, but in the end, there could be only one.

623
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:07,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was... Hold Your Color!

624
00:38:10,904 --> 00:38:13,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Which goes to show me that you all support goddamn cheating.

625
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:14,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

626
00:38:15,247 --> 00:38:15,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

627
00:38:16,676 --> 00:38:19,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Color of Sakura linked me to another Millborn PC game.

628
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:23,461
[SPEAKER_03]: The one I'm thinking of had other card games in it.

629
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:24,782
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just Millborn.

630
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:30,626
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like the official Millborn game, and it had Racco, and see, this is another Shareware one.

631
00:38:30,846 --> 00:38:32,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, a good start, but not the same one I'm thinking of.

632
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:37,230
[SPEAKER_03]: It had Racco in, I think, Phase 10, and there's some other game.

633
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't think of the name.

634
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:42,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

635
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:45,218
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about ready to get into the chatroom FUs of the week.

636
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:47,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just waiting to get a few, so they're open.

637
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:50,688
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send in your FUs of the week, send those over private message.

638
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:53,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Meantime, what was the chatroom talking about earlier?

639
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:54,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Clerks 2, right?

640
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:55,514
[SPEAKER_03]: When's that movie supposed to come out?

641
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:56,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

642
00:38:56,694 --> 00:38:57,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon, I know that.

643
00:38:58,635 --> 00:39:01,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit, I'm not that excited about it.

644
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:07,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Kevin Smith movies, don't get me wrong, except I didn't really, like Jersey Girl was kind of whatever, but I understand why that movie was made.

645
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:14,500
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know, my excitement for this movie hasn't been that as great as it should be.

646
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a sign that I'm turning 30 soon?

647
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,040
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

648
00:39:18,018 --> 00:39:18,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm starting to wonder.

649
00:39:19,379 --> 00:39:21,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm no longer an angsty 20-something.

650
00:39:21,682 --> 00:39:22,382
[SPEAKER_03]: August 18th.

651
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:23,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go see it.

652
00:39:23,764 --> 00:39:24,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see it too.

653
00:39:24,645 --> 00:39:25,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.

654
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:28,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I've watched every single Kevin Smith film, good or bad.

655
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:31,211
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did watch Jersey Girl and I didn't like Jersey Girl.

656
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:31,972
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

657
00:39:32,092 --> 00:39:33,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I sat through it and watched it.

658
00:39:33,594 --> 00:39:37,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will go see this because I love the Clerks movie.

659
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:39,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Clerks cartoon.

660
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:40,661
[SPEAKER_02]: More the cartoon than the movie.

661
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:41,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

662
00:39:42,202 --> 00:39:43,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it could be still funny.

663
00:39:43,643 --> 00:39:49,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just worried that they're going to try to pull it off like... You know, Jane Silent Bob Strike Back, not so good.

664
00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:53,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was an okay movie, but it just wasn't as good as... edgy as Clerks.

665
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:54,608
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't, you know, smart.

666
00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:56,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of dumb humor.

667
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,310
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um...

668
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:02,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all for the Clerks animated movie, which is supposed to be coming out after Clerks 2.

669
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:03,344
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the next thing he's working on.

670
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:05,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Clerks, Clerks, Clerks.

671
00:40:21,457 --> 00:40:24,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I see another network going this way, and it's really sad.

672
00:40:24,902 --> 00:40:29,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Cartoon Network is putting reruns of Saved by the Bell on there.

673
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:29,868
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's awesome.

674
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:30,469
[SPEAKER_03]: You shut up.

675
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:36,057
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome, because they showed Jesse's song on Thursday night, which, by the way, is the episode that is...

676
00:40:36,497 --> 00:40:37,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so excited!

677
00:40:38,198 --> 00:40:39,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so excited!

678
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:39,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited!

679
00:41:00,689 --> 00:41:00,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Got you.

680
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:01,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Got you.

681
00:41:17,148 --> 00:41:20,933
[SPEAKER_02]: GK128 says there's a rumor that Cartoon is actually trying to produce new Saved by the Bell episodes.

682
00:41:20,953 --> 00:41:21,053
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

683
00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:22,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Saved by the Bell the newer class.

684
00:41:36,218 --> 00:41:40,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Year 3 or Year... Get Elizabeth Berkley back.

685
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:40,962
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell's she done?

686
00:41:41,443 --> 00:41:43,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And Lark Voorhees.

687
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:44,745
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell happened to her?

688
00:41:45,146 --> 00:41:46,307
[SPEAKER_11]: No love for Lark.

689
00:41:46,387 --> 00:41:50,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless it takes place in the 80s, fuck it.

690
00:41:50,891 --> 00:41:52,872
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want a modernized Saved by the Bell.

691
00:41:53,313 --> 00:41:53,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want it.

692
00:41:54,293 --> 00:41:55,174
[SPEAKER_11]: I lived through that.

693
00:41:55,314 --> 00:41:55,915
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want it.

694
00:41:58,064 --> 00:42:08,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should make Saved by the Bell edgy like what was that one show that was on Fox for a while that had to deal with the faculty and stuff.

695
00:42:08,574 --> 00:42:10,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what the hell it was called now.

696
00:42:10,356 --> 00:42:10,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Teachers?

697
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:15,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw says what Cartoon Network needs is to put that old 80s Chuck Norris cartoon on.

698
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:16,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hell yes.

699
00:42:17,462 --> 00:42:21,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Color of Sakura says they need to bring back Freakazoid, which met with much cheers in the chat room.

700
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Freakazoid movie, live action, Jim Carrey playing the lead.

701
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,872
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the coolest shit ever.

702
00:42:29,153 --> 00:42:33,456
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100, Matt says Adult Swim should stop putting full house and putting fucking clerks on there.

703
00:42:33,476 --> 00:42:34,897
[SPEAKER_03]: They have full house on Adult Swim?

704
00:42:34,978 --> 00:42:35,658
[SPEAKER_03]: How rude.

705
00:42:35,698 --> 00:42:36,279
[SPEAKER_03]: The fuck?

706
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:37,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that for real?

707
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:38,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

708
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:39,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Better not be.

709
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:42,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I only heard of, um, just save at the bell.

710
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:43,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

711
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:45,050
[SPEAKER_03]: But how long is it going to last?

712
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they really going to have that for a long time?

713
00:42:46,472 --> 00:42:47,413
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems like one of those things.

714
00:42:50,397 --> 00:42:52,921
[SPEAKER_03]: They're airing all the big episodes.

715
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:54,883
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not airing everything I don't think.

716
00:42:55,836 --> 00:42:56,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

717
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:59,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Jesse's song had the music video in it too.

718
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:01,199
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great episode.

719
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:02,800
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quality television.

720
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I T-voted it.

721
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God.

722
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:12,604
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want to play something at like 3 in the morning that's like, you know, just like the 80s live action TV show hour, that's fine.

723
00:43:12,644 --> 00:43:13,385
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do that.

724
00:43:13,505 --> 00:43:16,566
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't go with G4's doing this.

725
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:17,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha, ha.

726
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:21,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Ichiban Crush says in chat, Saved by the Bell is only going to be on Adult Swim for two weeks.

727
00:43:22,492 --> 00:43:23,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, that's cool.

728
00:43:23,412 --> 00:43:28,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they can see they're airing all the memorable episodes, and then they can go to a different crappy 80s show.

729
00:43:28,794 --> 00:43:29,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's cool.

730
00:43:30,214 --> 00:43:30,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

731
00:43:30,895 --> 00:43:31,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's fine, then.

732
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:35,556
[SPEAKER_02]: But the whole thing is I don't like what they're doing in G4.

733
00:43:36,496 --> 00:43:39,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, who the hell is directing?

734
00:43:39,097 --> 00:43:40,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, someone needs to go.

735
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:46,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, G4 is supposed to be TV about games.

736
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:48,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Please explain how...

737
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Fastlane, Star Trek, Brainiac,

738
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,171
[SPEAKER_02]: They sidestepped it.

739
00:43:57,231 --> 00:43:57,932
[SPEAKER_02]: They sidestepped it.

740
00:43:57,952 --> 00:43:59,533
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not TV about games.

741
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,155
[SPEAKER_03]: It's TV for gamers.

742
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's not really games.

743
00:44:03,137 --> 00:44:05,359
[SPEAKER_03]: They've kind of admitted it's not really about games anymore.

744
00:44:05,419 --> 00:44:07,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Not all gamers watch Star Trek.

745
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of us do.

746
00:44:07,641 --> 00:44:12,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, didn't you see the press release this week that they hired Howard Stern's girlfriend to be the new host of Filter?

747
00:44:13,226 --> 00:44:14,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that show failed.

748
00:44:14,407 --> 00:44:15,748
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't because of the host.

749
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:17,410
[SPEAKER_03]: They're bringing it back, and it's not about gaming topics.

750
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:21,514
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to be – Icons is now no longer – It wasn't about gaming topics when it was –

751
00:44:22,094 --> 00:44:24,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Icons is no longer going to be about gaming topics.

752
00:44:24,235 --> 00:44:25,455
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be about J.J.

753
00:44:25,615 --> 00:44:28,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Abrams and who's the guy that did X-Men?

754
00:44:28,656 --> 00:44:30,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Bryan Singer and all that stuff.

755
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:32,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was the other thing?

756
00:44:34,277 --> 00:44:36,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Something about Attack of the Show being retooled.

757
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:39,498
[SPEAKER_03]: They're adding another co-host to it.

758
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:42,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, who is not even a game type person.

759
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:44,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, most of them weren't anyway.

760
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:45,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

761
00:44:46,057 --> 00:44:47,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still pissed when I ate up Tech TV.

762
00:45:13,157 --> 00:45:14,818
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still sore over that.

763
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:23,125
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we like getting to work with Scott Rubin as limited as we do because we get to work with someone who jumped ship before it all went downhill.

764
00:45:23,966 --> 00:45:25,447
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we know he's a smart man.

765
00:45:25,507 --> 00:45:30,991
[SPEAKER_03]: He got off that sinking ship before it hit rock bottom.

766
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:32,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

767
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:36,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm a gamer and I don't get it.

768
00:45:36,982 --> 00:45:38,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to FUs, okay?

769
00:45:38,363 --> 00:45:39,604
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna get to the chatroom FUs.

770
00:45:39,624 --> 00:45:40,744
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of them, so here we go.

771
00:45:41,044 --> 00:45:45,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight's FU music is being provided by Kid Whatever, who was on the show earlier tonight.

772
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:45,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Dun dun dun.

773
00:45:46,347 --> 00:45:53,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, um... Shaoran says FU to Girl Scouts for selling amazing cookies at such a high price.

774
00:45:53,611 --> 00:45:55,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have no big monies to buy no fancy cookies.

775
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:59,754
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to my computer for turning off at random moments for no good reason.

776
00:46:00,335 --> 00:46:03,797
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to myself for only just finishing my huge project for school.

777
00:46:04,813 --> 00:46:09,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Laser123454321 says, F you to Sky.

778
00:46:10,796 --> 00:46:11,716
[SPEAKER_03]: There's your shirt.

779
00:46:11,796 --> 00:46:12,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my era?

780
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:14,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, cool, fat mix.

781
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:17,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I remember something.

782
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:19,159
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something from the Rob Roberts show.

783
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:20,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to check out this link.

784
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm supposed to send them an MP3, and I haven't.

785
00:46:24,822 --> 00:46:25,862
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad, Laser.

786
00:46:25,922 --> 00:46:26,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

787
00:46:27,943 --> 00:46:28,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

788
00:46:29,464 --> 00:46:30,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's check this out here.

789
00:46:30,344 --> 00:46:30,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Control-V.

790
00:46:36,855 --> 00:46:38,957
[SPEAKER_11]: In which Rob gets completely whipped by his fans.

791
00:46:40,379 --> 00:46:42,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't get the link to come up, how sad am I?

792
00:46:44,663 --> 00:46:45,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Copy?

793
00:46:45,364 --> 00:46:52,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, dap you to my computer for causing the- okay there we go, finally, let's see this.

794
00:46:52,971 --> 00:46:54,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's in control here?

795
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's the shirt.

796
00:46:58,238 --> 00:46:58,878
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I want.

797
00:46:58,938 --> 00:47:03,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I said I want somebody to design a shirt that says, I figured out how to quit you.

798
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:04,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

799
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,320
[SPEAKER_03]: In the western font, like Brokeback Mountain.

800
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:07,780
[SPEAKER_03]: And there it is.

801
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:08,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured out how to quit you.

802
00:47:08,941 --> 00:47:09,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

803
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:10,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

804
00:47:11,341 --> 00:47:12,742
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wish I knew how to quit you.

805
00:47:15,287 --> 00:47:16,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna send that idea over to Busted Teaser.

806
00:47:17,409 --> 00:47:18,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tap four, bitch.

807
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:18,891
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tap four.

00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:21,634

00:47:21,674 --> 00:47:25,198
[SPEAKER_03]: DidYouLoseASock says, What was song number two that lost by one vote?

810
00:47:25,738 --> 00:47:26,920
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the Emo Kid song.

811
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other one was only two votes.

812
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:28,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

813
00:47:29,562 --> 00:47:35,429
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to Nintendo of America for not bringing Mother 3 stateside, but tip of the hat to Nintendo of Japan for actually making the game.

814
00:47:35,909 --> 00:47:37,630
[SPEAKER_03]: If you lose a sock, don't lose hope yet.

815
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:41,953
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not announced at E3, then get angsty, okay?

816
00:47:42,113 --> 00:47:45,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Gizm says, F you to Oblivion for taking up all my time.

817
00:47:45,835 --> 00:47:47,035
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on my Xbox Live friends list.

00:47:47,055 --> 00:47:48,436
[SPEAKER_03]: You are always on that damn game.

00:47:49,357 --> 00:47:52,798
[SPEAKER_03]: GK128, of course I'm always on Final Fantasy XI.

820
00:47:52,818 --> 00:47:59,742
[SPEAKER_03]: GK128 says, F you Natsume for taking three shitty This Gen Harvest Moon games to finally release one awesome one in Magical Melody.

821
00:48:00,082 --> 00:48:00,703
[SPEAKER_03]: What, Natsume?

822
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Make another Lufia.

823
00:48:02,104 --> 00:48:02,604
[SPEAKER_03]: We want it.

824
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:07,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Andy THPS says, F you to Korean online games for their insane XP curves.

825
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:16,433
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ichiban Crush says, F you to that shitty Famicom game I had to review for LostLevel.org, which made me lose my love for Puyo Puyo.

826
00:48:17,421 --> 00:48:19,383
[SPEAKER_03]: DanceCook says, F you to my friend Andy.

827
00:48:19,744 --> 00:48:22,907
[SPEAKER_03]: He talked me into playing Strip Advanced Wars with him and I lost horribly.

828
00:48:23,087 --> 00:48:23,508
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hot.

829
00:48:24,128 --> 00:48:27,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, F you to the book Pulp because the ending made me really emo.

830
00:48:27,933 --> 00:48:30,315
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I wasn't mad when you called me DanceCook earlier.

831
00:48:30,355 --> 00:48:31,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Well good, because I just called you that again.

832
00:48:32,658 --> 00:48:38,605
[SPEAKER_03]: PhoenixRising says, F you to having to work so hard to level in MMOs and the overratedness of World of Warcraft.

833
00:48:39,185 --> 00:48:42,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Phoenix Rising would also like to say F you to Sony for opposing homebrew so much.

834
00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:44,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I will gank you.

835
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:51,756
[SPEAKER_03]: ColorofSakura says F you to DreamLineOut for canceling their appearance at Bomani Fest 2006 and making Tokyo Game Action look bad.

836
00:48:52,317 --> 00:48:53,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that.

837
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:54,799
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.

838
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:00,184
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like their big draw was that Mr. T, oh my gosh, that sucks.

839
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:01,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, the whole Tokyo game.

840
00:49:01,745 --> 00:49:02,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that.

841
00:49:02,265 --> 00:49:03,245
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first I heard of that.

842
00:49:03,285 --> 00:49:05,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go to Bomaiso, read the front pages.

843
00:49:05,066 --> 00:49:06,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, ooh, ooh, I'm gonna do that right now.

[SPEAKER_03]: W-W-W dot B-E-M-A-N-I-S-T-Y-L-E dot C-O-M.

845
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is Rob typing aggressively.

846
00:49:16,551 --> 00:49:19,172
[SPEAKER_03]: That's me typing with one hand, because the other hand's on the microphone.

847
00:49:20,313 --> 00:49:21,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure it is.

848
00:49:21,133 --> 00:49:22,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, an actual microphone.

849
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's a big ol' no, Jesus Christ.

850
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't read that much.

851
00:49:53,537 --> 00:49:53,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

852
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:55,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I need Cliff Notes.

853
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:57,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Is somebody... Is Rennie listening?

854
00:49:57,347 --> 00:49:59,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Rennie, I need that article done in bullet points.

855
00:49:59,975 --> 00:50:00,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

856
00:50:00,476 --> 00:50:00,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

858
00:50:07,848 --> 00:50:08,649
[SPEAKER_03]: They just announced it.

859
00:50:08,969 --> 00:50:11,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's the follow-up to Saved by the Bell.

860
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:17,934
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt would like to say, F you to Major League Baseball for not accepting my application for Final Cut Pro Editor.

00:50:56,702 --> 00:50:58,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even have a 360, mind you.

868
00:50:58,203 --> 00:50:59,304

[SPEAKER_03]: Control-Alt-F'd said a continuous F you to my workplace.

[SPEAKER_03]: That was a lot of FUs.

878
00:51:43,576 --> 00:51:45,918
[SPEAKER_03]: You all are some angsty motherfuckers tonight, I'll tell you that.

879
00:51:46,118 --> 00:51:47,139
[SPEAKER_03]: They must be emo.

[SPEAKER_03]: Color of Sakura says Konami is giving that arcade a supernova machine.

881
00:51:51,323 --> 00:51:51,983
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very nice.

882
00:51:52,764 --> 00:52:06,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, we forgot to mention that Konami is going to have two supernova machines close to final at E3, which will be fun to play and film and record any audio from said machines.

883
00:52:09,363 --> 00:52:10,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

[SPEAKER_03]: What is gay lesbian silence day?

886
00:52:44,937 --> 00:52:46,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I am gay and I don't even know about it.

887
00:52:46,438 --> 00:52:49,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like everything else in the gay circle, I'm always the last to know.

888
00:52:49,341 --> 00:53:00,009
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they had this whole high school college demonstration where people would be silent for a few hours and I don't know what the hell it was supposed to signify, but it was supposed to be some sort of gay rights thing.

889
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:00,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

890
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:01,691
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't get it either.

891
00:53:02,491 --> 00:53:03,052
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't get it.

892
00:53:03,232 --> 00:53:04,353
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not being gay.

893
00:53:04,653 --> 00:53:06,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Most gay people I know are fucking loud.

894
00:53:08,316 --> 00:53:09,017
[SPEAKER_03]: You're telling me.

895
00:53:11,127 --> 00:53:12,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I only can make fun because I am gay.

896
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:14,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

897
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:16,630
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

898
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:18,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's going to do it.

899
00:53:19,052 --> 00:53:20,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're done with tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio.

900
00:53:20,913 --> 00:53:21,953
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a long time here.

901
00:53:21,973 --> 00:53:23,394
[SPEAKER_03]: We're damn near on four hours now.

902
00:53:23,454 --> 00:53:25,195
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's time for us to stop broadcasting.

903
00:53:25,575 --> 00:53:27,196
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

904
00:53:27,456 --> 00:53:28,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought.

905
00:53:29,037 --> 00:53:30,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I have lots of work to do this week.

906
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if I'll see you.

907
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

908
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:36,762
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one story I forgot.

909
00:53:37,918 --> 00:53:38,579
[SPEAKER_02]: H2V2.ggl.com H2V2.ggl.com

910
00:54:07,779 --> 00:54:09,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Ryoma clarified here.

911
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:12,827
[SPEAKER_03]: They were ignoring people because gays were being ignored or something like that.

912
00:54:14,229 --> 00:54:15,612
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm around, I can't be ignored.

913
00:54:15,772 --> 00:54:16,874
[SPEAKER_03]: How hard is it to ignore?

914
00:54:17,795 --> 00:54:18,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew, your final thought.

915
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I have fury.

916
00:54:23,548 --> 00:54:28,189
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is time for me to go play more Final Fantasy XI.

917
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:29,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Addict.

918
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:31,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up, you're not Jamie.

919
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, okay, I'm a WoW addict.

920
00:54:33,251 --> 00:54:33,991
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no room to talk.

921
00:54:34,111 --> 00:54:38,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, kids, no live show next week, but tune into the podcast stream.

922
00:54:38,652 --> 00:54:41,073
[SPEAKER_03]: When you next hear Loki, he will be a married man.

923
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:42,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Sucker.

924
00:54:43,553 --> 00:54:47,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will be the only unmarried OLR host.

925
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:48,975
[SPEAKER_03]: How sad.

926
00:54:50,293 --> 00:54:53,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And since, you know, with laws being the way they are, I won't be getting married for a while.

927
00:54:54,275 --> 00:54:55,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Wah, wah, wah.

928
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:57,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless I move to Massachusetts.

929
00:54:57,897 --> 00:54:58,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, who cares.

930
00:54:58,938 --> 00:55:00,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh well, you're not a sucker, right?

931
00:55:00,299 --> 00:55:02,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it just gives me the right to be bitter.

932
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I'm especially bitter on the show, I can just go, hey, it's because I'm not married.

933
00:55:09,604 --> 00:55:10,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, everybody.

934
00:55:10,805 --> 00:55:12,947
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next time.

935
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:13,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned to the podcast stream.

936
00:55:13,827 --> 00:55:14,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Two weeks, by the way.

937
00:55:14,788 --> 00:55:15,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Big announcement on the show.

938
00:55:16,209 --> 00:55:17,229
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, maybe before that.

939
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned to the website around May 1st-ish.

940
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:20,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, Loki?

941
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:22,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

942
00:55:22,593 --> 00:55:23,534
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll tell you this much.

943
00:55:24,314 --> 00:55:27,637
[SPEAKER_03]: We're launching a new website, and it's a PSP thing.

944
00:55:28,557 --> 00:55:28,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

945
00:55:28,877 --> 00:55:29,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all we'll say.

946
00:55:29,978 --> 00:55:30,178

00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:36,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

950
00:55:36,463 --> 00:55:36,703
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

951
00:55:37,984 --> 00:55:38,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a super day, everybody.

952
00:55:39,004 --> 00:55:39,745
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk to you later.

953
00:55:40,365 --> 00:55:43,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting Internet Radio.

954
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:47,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Please reconnect to the stream in about 15 seconds to resume... Oh, shit!

955
00:55:47,088 --> 00:55:49,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost forgot the fortune cookie message of the day.

956
00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:50,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit!

957
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:53,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because DarkSakura's not here to give me the death stare.

958
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:57,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is, your fortune cookie message of the day, which I almost forgot.

959
00:55:58,113 --> 00:55:58,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn me.

960
00:55:59,173 --> 00:56:00,614
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a special moment right now.

961
00:56:00,654 --> 00:56:06,356
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd like to take this time to tell all the kids at home, send your parents out of the room.

962
00:56:06,376 --> 00:56:07,197
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a kid's song.

963
00:56:09,175 --> 00:56:19,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Life's gonna suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up Life's gonna suck when you grow up, it sucks pretty bad right now Hey, if you know the words, sing along!

964
00:56:19,427 --> 00:56:28,378
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna have to mow the lawn, do the dishes, make your bed You're gonna have to go to school until you're seventeen It's gonna seem about three times as long as that

965
00:56:34,622 --> 00:56:36,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey cheer up kids, it gets a lot worse!

966
00:56:39,923 --> 00:57:04,506
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna have to deal with stress, deal with stress, deal with stress You're gonna be a giant mess when you get back from the war Santa Claus does not exist and there's no Easter Bunny You'll find out when you grow up that Drake Bird isn't funny Life's gonna suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up Life's gonna suck when you grow up, it sucks pretty bad right now

967
00:57:06,067 --> 00:57:14,530
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna end up smoking crack On your back, face the back You're gonna end up hooked on smack And then you're gonna die And then you're gonna die

968
00:57:33,578 --> 00:57:35,479
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is a damn dirty cheater too.

969
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,921
[SPEAKER_03]: That song was just in like four weeks ago, I think.

970
00:57:39,443 --> 00:57:39,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well.

971
00:57:40,463 --> 00:57:40,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well.

972
00:57:41,804 --> 00:57:43,065
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was in last week's pre-show.

973
00:57:43,105 --> 00:57:47,208
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it sounds like it was in last week's pre-show, but it wasn't Fortune Cookie not that long ago.

974
00:57:47,609 --> 00:57:49,470
[SPEAKER_03]: The moral of the story is, it pays to cheat.

975
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,312
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, that's one of my favorite Fortune Cookie messages anyway, so I don't care.

976
00:57:52,893 --> 00:57:55,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll play that every week if you kids don't shut up.

977
00:57:57,416 --> 00:57:57,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

978
00:57:58,237 --> 00:57:58,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Love ya.

00:57:59,258 --> 00:58:03,401
