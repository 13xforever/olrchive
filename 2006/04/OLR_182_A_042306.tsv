13666	26477	Tonight, April 23rd, 2006, Loki spills tentative release dates for Sony games, many companies begin announcing their E3 plans, and Kid Whatever, musician from In The Groove, joins us to talk about the game and his new CD.
32372	37315	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
37356	42839	This is episode number 182 for this April the 23rd, 2006.
45081	45921	My name is Rob Roberts.
45962	48643	You might know me as Sky, not joining us tonight.
48743	53147	DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers, she is off tonight for her birthday.
53787	56729	And I can say I did attend her birthday festivities.
56769	60712	We went to Dave and Buster's last night in the Bay Area and watched her get mighty drunk.
61312	62293	and it was a good time.
62473	63554	So she's recovering today.
63594	64895	She probably has a little bit of a hangover.
65015	70818	No, I guess she doesn't really get hangovers or at least she claims not to but she's up to no good either way.
71699	79424	And she also gets to be lazy next week because next week we are not going to be having a show because of our other co-host right over there, Loki.
79724	79985	Yes.
80405	81325	What did you do now?
81906	82846	I had to go get married.
82866	83307	That's right.
83367	84968	Loki's getting married next Sunday.
85916	87758	Congratulations in advance.
88138	93702	We're not going to be here next Sunday because Jamie and I are obviously going to the wedding, so we won't be able to do the show.
93963	95384	However, stay tuned to the podcast stream.
95404	99687	We will have something for you guys we're cooking up, but we will not be here live, I'm sorry to say.
99787	109855	However, there will be playing live an old classic episode, maybe something that's been in popular demand for a little while to be replayed now involving a certain karaoke episode.
109875	110296	We'll see.
110316	111036	We'll see.
111056	112378	I'll have to dig it up if I can find it.
113118	118503	I may have to actually talk to one of our people that archived this show, like Misty or Angel or something, see if I can dig it up.
118944	119324	So we'll see.
119784	126591	For the prosperity of the show, I suppose I could give you the recordings.
127692	132954	We are here to talk about video games that you guys really want to know about, try to avoid things that suck.
133434	137456	One thing that the critics thought really sucked was the Silent Hill movie that came out this week.
137796	142318	Of course, we have been talking and talking about this movie for a long time, hyping this up on the show.
142978	144278	Loki, did it deliver?
144298	144919	Did it disappoint?
144939	145359	What did you think?
145719	150381	Well, their excuse was that they couldn't figure out what was going on in the plot.
150561	150901	I don't know.
150941	154202	It seemed pretty straightforward to me.
154922	155242	I don't know.
155883	156843	Yeah, it didn't.
157794	186140	I think the plot was, and of course we're trying to make this spoiler free so let's be good and not spoil this for anybody because not everybody's seen this but I think the plot is open to interpretation especially at the end because there's been arguments on LiveJournal back and forth between me and other people on what the ending really represents and does it mean one thing versus another thing so I think any movie that can get you to talk about it long after you've seen it is a good movie
187286	190008	I think movies are things you should be able to talk about.
190188	190749	Well, I don't know.
190769	192370	There's movies of different entertainment values.
192730	194531	Some movies, like, you know, take Terminator.
194571	195952	Okay, that's just bang, bang, shoot him up.
195992	197193	There's nothing to really talk about.
197233	198494	That's a different type of entertainment.
198954	202156	But, you know, Silent Hill was a different type of film.
202416	203337	What did you think, though, overall?
203357	203777	You like it?
204037	204538	Didn't like it?
205118	205579	It was okay.
206699	207220	It was okay?
207460	208941	Yeah, it was cool.
211202	211462	I don't know.
211482	216706	I haven't really watched that many video game movies, so I can't really say if it's better or worse than any of them.
219128	221469	I would say it's definitely worth seeing.
221689	222690	It's not bad.
223270	225671	I think it was pretty good, actually.
225772	227693	Even for just a horror movie, it was pretty good.
228753	230994	My whole complaint with the whole movie is just towards the end.
231575	232215	It gets a little weird.
232475	232775	PYRAMID HEADS
253934	255295	is the scariest thing in the whole movie.
255495	256255	I mean, seriously.
256395	261478	Because, you know, I think a lot of you guys have heard about one scene in particular, but I won't say it to spoil it for you guys.
261718	263339	But that's not the only, like, scary moment.
263379	266000	I mean, there's another scene that's just, like, really freaky.
266300	273804	And I'll tell you what, the sound when Pyramid Head walks and the sword scraping on the ground, like, it was just awesome.
274604	275404	That was pretty cool.
276405	279706	I thought that the monsters were done very well.
280247	280747	It was very...
281212	284454	Very true to the whole storyline, so that's good.
286515	288115	It was well done.
288375	293898	It wasn't like some crappy, you know... It was just a really crappy movie or anything.
293918	294378	What do you think?
294498	295699	Best video game movie ever?
298841	299441	Well, I don't know.
300321	301922	After all, Double Dragon was pretty good.
301942	302142	It was...
308303	309544	So far, it's pretty good.
309724	314809	I don't know if it's going to be the best ever, but I liked it.
314989	316971	It was definitely a very strong start.
317231	318572	Who cares if the critics don't like it?
318632	322155	Most of the critics didn't know what they were talking about and were just saying stupid stuff.
322476	323797	Granted, the dialogue sucked.
324457	326059	Yeah, the dialogue was my biggest problem with the movie.
326079	326780	We'll give them that.
327400	329482	The plot not being able to be understood...
330183	331403	It was pretty straightforward to me.
331543	335645	I was even looking at it in a sense, how could you confuse this?
336005	338545	I didn't think the plot was nearly as bad as the critics made it out to be.
338665	341006	I don't understand how they could be confused with that stuff.
341146	343467	I personally think they didn't try, or they just didn't care.
343687	349648	Something somebody said in my live journal, which had me thinking a little bit, was the dialogue intentionally bad to be like the games?
350969	351629	Maybe.
352149	358771	There were some parts that was like, huh, why is this like, it seemed like part of a game.
359246	359947	PYRAMID HEAD PYRAMID HEAD
383008	384029	That was fan service.
384149	386851	I didn't need the movie to feel like the video game.
387912	389253	In a way, it did feel like the game.
390053	399140	Everything outside of dialogue, like the fog ambience and the characters were very Silent Hill and the monsters were awesome and all that stuff.
400120	401881	I think it was cool.
402122	408246	I would have liked to have seen less of the cult stuff towards the end and more of just the beginning of the movie.
408266	411188	If they took the beginning of the movie and doubled that
411917	412920	That would have been a really good movie.
412940	415107	Tell me that siren thing isn't the freakiest thing, though.
415127	416090	That was awesome.
416511	417173	It was cool.
418878	419621	Yeah, it just...
420191	420491	I don't know.
420952	421192	Alright.
421292	428958	I think the first monsters that you see were, I thought were the scariest, but they're at least the creepiest, I mean, but I don't know, that's just me.
430059	442489	And again, just for my thoughts, I wasn't like, OMG, best movie ever, and the movie wasn't without its, you know, pretty big flaws, but I thought it was good, and you know, it's really violent, it totally delivers on the violence and blood and gore thing, and it's pretty freaky.
442789	443930	It's a different type of scare.
443970	448754	It's not slasher movie scary, it's like WTF, question mark, exclamation point,
448954	449955	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
477617	483901	Anyway, also joining us tonight, say hello to, make sure the mic's on over there, the 23rd Magus, also known as Andrew.
484101	484902	Yeah, it's been a while.
485442	487043	It has been a little while since you've been on the program.
488664	490806	Well, there's not much else to say about it.
491866	493147	Just been away for a long time.
493807	495028	Sorry, your volume's been pretty bad.
495048	496249	I'm just adjusting you on the fly there.
496829	497530	All right, how's this?
497590	498250	There, much better.
498370	499011	All right, awesome.
499231	499611	Sounds good.
499911	505975	So you used to come on the show a lot back in the old days when we weren't doing the podcast thing, when we were just like a live-only thing.
506175	506676	Yeah, it was...
508291	508731	Big fun.
509171	509991	It was a good time.
510111	515812	Back when the show wasn't like kind of crappy like it is now, when it was just plain crappy back in the day.
515912	517653	It was broke down ghetto Bomani radio.
517713	518273	Exactly.
519093	520353	Well, we don't do the Bomani thing.
520433	521113	Well, I mean, we do.
521293	523474	I mean, we have big music game thing.
523494	527434	We actually have a special guest tonight who's a big part of music games.
527474	528655	Not Bomani, but music games.
529195	535116	And, you know, we still definitely do our tribute once in a while to music games, but we try to think everything.
535156	536036	Yeah, we think as a whole.
536396	536516	Yeah.
537509	538570	Video Game Fans First
562740	564322	Somehow, I think they got reprinted.
564923	566965	I managed to pick up Rez and Guitaroman.
567806	570830	They were marketed as used at a local GameStop.
571530	572251	Yes, I don't know.
573112	578318	They've been having a lot of the older games just suddenly popping up on shelves everywhere.
579059	580240	I have no idea why.
580581	582343	No, Rez would make a good PSP game.
583084	583344	It would.
584346	588268	Alright, speaking of games, I'd like to start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week?
588308	589628	What kind of stuff have you been playing?
589668	590429	What have you been into?
590529	591289	Loki, start us off.
592129	600033	I've been playing, well mainly today, I've been playing Mutant Storm Reloaded or whatever that is.
600553	602434	And that game is pretty cool.
602594	605936	I'm trying to go through the, what was it?
606016	609557	It's not the adventure mode, the other one.
610198	612279	Anyways, so I was trying to get up there.
612379	612799	I'm like...
614506	621611	rank 2,445 or something now because I actually have to play through the game.
621651	624873	I didn't realize you get more points if you play it on black belt and stuff.
625434	639504	So, I've been playing everything I'm up through like, oh man, I want to say like 65 on yellow belt and then I'm just starting to replay them all again on black belt.
639904	643126	The difficulty gets friggin' annoying just in some of the games.
643607	643807	But, um,
644332	645413	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
670225	673046	and so I crashed into the car and then they win.
673146	675006	I'm like, what the fuck was that?
675967	677847	So it's just ridiculous stuff like that.
679108	687050	The other thing I've been playing, of course, we started doing team games in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and this is where the game starts to fall apart.
687430	693892	Not necessarily in the fact that team games suck on it because team games are really fun and have actually kind of made the whole game new again.
694553	699254	It's just that the programming that they did for the team games is so horrible that you cannot...
699975	701376	Most of the time you can't get them to work.
701856	705359	In fact, a lot of times we'll spawn and you'll be a ball instead of a player.
705719	707080	And you'll have to reboot the whole thing.
707120	708000	The whole thing will crash.
708581	714785	So, you know, big fuck you to Rockstar for really dropping the ball and programming the multiplayer in this game.
714845	717287	It just completely makes it unplayable sometimes.
717867	719008	So, it's weird.
719068	721569	And because we have six players team games and it won't work.
721930	726953	But if you do six players just one-on-one, you know, everyone for themselves, it works fine.
727341	731322	So, that doesn't make any sense at all, but I don't know.
731342	732842	I hope they fix this in the next one.
733343	735243	Otherwise, someone's going to need to be punched in the face.
736383	740404	And then, other than that, I haven't really played too much else.
740944	745566	I tried playing a little bit more Rubble Roses XX, and I don't know.
746026	748746	I'm going to try playing through the game just to get some more achievement points.
749367	751007	That's about it, but, you know.
752547	755068	And, yeah, that's pretty much it.
757144	758685	I've been playing a couple games this week.
758945	760485	I checked out Brain Age on the DS.
761005	762226	Train your brain in minutes a day.
763006	764166	It's different.
764246	765947	It's not your typical kind of game.
766007	773448	I think if you're going in expecting some type of 20 hours to beat type start to finish game, you're going to be a little bit disappointed.
773468	775489	That's not the point behind brain training.
775869	782835	Basically, what it is, is that you've got a lot of little games, like mini-games, that you play, and it's supposed to get you thinking.
782875	784256	It's supposed to get your brain moving.
784296	785857	It's like brain exercises, essentially.
786417	790401	For instance, one of the game is do 20 math problems as fast as you can.
791201	795023	I know that sounds a little cheesy, but it's actually kind of fun, you know, to like get your brain moving.
795043	802726	And you have to be a little bit nerdy, I think, to like it though, because if you're just like, if you're like, ew, math, you're probably not going to get as big of a thrill out of it.
803806	809128	Which is cool because it recognizes your handwriting, although if you have crappy handwriting like me, you're going to have some problems.
809188	815791	For instances, I write my eights, like I don't write a big curve, like, you know, like a big loop.
816431	817272	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
836772	839254	The other problem the game has is with voice recognition.
839274	850240	There's another game where what you're supposed to do is that the name of a color will show up on the screen, like it'll say red, but the word will actually be written either in the same color or a different color.
850620	854663	And you're supposed to say not the word, but the color that the word is written in.
855143	859366	So it like messes with you a little bit because even though it might say red, it's in black text.
859386	860587	You have to say black.
860968	863810	So you get either red, black, yellow, or blue.
864110	864971	Well, here's the thing.
865291	869314	The DS has a real hard time recognizing me saying blue.
869754	871335	Like I'll say blue and it goes, try again.
871496	872276	Blue, try again.
872596	873077	Blue!
873397	874378	And it still doesn't work.
874538	875979	And I'm not the only one that had this problem.
875999	876960	My roommate had this problem.
877000	879141	I've listened to other people review this game have the same problem.
879562	880983	I have the fix for you.
881323	883445	This is how to get the game to recognize what you're saying.
884085	886268	And I know this is going to sound really wrong.
886488	889792	It's going to sound really, really wrong, but it works.
890032	891514	If you don't believe me, try it.
891975	895960	Instead of saying blue, say brew, and it works.
898424	901025	Just change your L's to an R, and it works.
901245	901965	I'm not even kidding.
901985	903725	Why am I somehow not surprised?
903745	905746	That is completely racist, bro.
905866	906446	You know what?
907106	907426	Do it.
907586	910547	If you're having problems with the game, recognize you saying blue.
910607	913468	Try, brew, brew, brew, and it'll work.
914068	915088	It completely worked for me.
915128	919949	It has not misread me saying blue once yet, ever since I started talking.
919969	922710	I thought having Phoenix Wright not recognizing objection was bad.
924904	925324	Exactly.
926264	928886	Alright, so the game is fun.
929066	938111	It kind of reminds me of those old puzzle books that you can get at the supermarket, like Games Magazine, I think was the one that would always have little puzzles in it, and the penny press and all those little things.
938131	946096	If you like those types of things, because Sudoku's in the game too, and Sudoku is really big in those magazines, I think you're really going to like this.
947237	967531	and I think it's just kind of a it's really a groundbreaking game because you know it's been advertised in Time Magazine and they're showing it on TV in these different style commercials I think they're really trying to reach a different audience with this game so it's gonna be very interesting to see how well this game does because they are not trying to reach your typical gamer and I'll tell you most
968151	970192	and typical gamers, quote unquote.
970472	979677	Probably not the folks that listen to this show, but like when I say gamers, like those that play like Madden and Halo shoot-em-ups exclusively that don't play a lot of the other stuff, probably aren't going to like this.
979997	984699	This is definitely geared towards a different audience, but I think it's a good investment.
985140	987201	$20 is a pretty good price for a DS game.
987561	988261	And you know what?
988301	991082	You get Sudoku, which is, you know, really popular and all that stuff.
991123	994044	Even though it's a little bit overrated, it'll keep you busy for a long time.
994488	998731	or just buy it used when it, you know, you'll probably see it used in a few weeks.
999391	999651	For 15.
999711	999971	Yeah.
1000932	1005795	So I got my, I would like to say I got my brain age down to 21, which is really, as low as you can go is 20.
1006375	1010958	But the first time I tested because it had problems picking up blue, I had to go, blue, blue.
1012439	1014580	My brain age was like 54 or something the first time.
1014600	1015560	It was kind of sad.
1017412	1023178	Anyway, heading on over to www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat to hear from our chatters.
1024019	1028363	Let's see, DidYouLoseASock says, I'm dyslexic and I write all my letters backwards.
1028423	1029825	The letters don't appear backwards.
1029925	1032667	I start and finish writing a letter different than normal people.
1033368	1038093	So yeah, those of you that have a different style of writing things might be in for a shock.
1038434	1040296	Now, I write my A's kind of funny.
1040436	1041897	I don't write my A's like most people do.
1041957	1043759	Most people do like an O with a tail.
1044580	1048845	I draw mine like a printed letter A, like an upside down E. That's how I write my A's.
1049165	1052189	And the game recognizes that, so at least I have that.
1052269	1054271	So the game isn't totally stupid.
1054651	1059115	But some of you guys that have weird handwriting things are going to have some challenges there, so be careful.
1060636	1069022	And BlackWolf, who also does a show over there on All Games Radio, BlackWolf says, Sudoku is just the side game.
1069062	1071384	It's not part of the main Brain Age gameplay.
1071885	1078090	No, it's not a part of the main gameplay, but it does kind of fit along with that same theme of, you know, exercise your brain.
1078110	1083354	And when you go into it, it says, Sudoku is a great way to exercise the cortex part of your brain, all that stuff.
1083394	1083514	So,
1083974	1088157	It kind of, even though it's like a side game, it fits into the same idea.
1088257	1089498	So it's, you know, a little bonus.
1090559	1092501	Which makes the advertising of the game appropriate.
1092761	1094723	I have that little sticker that says Sudoku included.
1094783	1095003	Woo!
1095923	1096164	Alright.
1097224	1098385	Also, the other game I played.
1099726	1100847	This might surprise you.
1101148	1103449	I love Final Fantasy XI.
1103469	1104270	You know this, right?
1104550	1106872	I talk about it a lot on this program.
1107012	1110235	I've invested far too many hours into this game.
1110275	1112336	It's an MMO that sucked away my life.
1112777	1113057	Okay?
1113533	1116774	I'm going to give Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 a negative review.
1117354	1117954	Here's why.
1118855	1123736	Final Fantasy XI on 360 is not going to work for your typical Xbox 360 gamer.
1124256	1131298	I feel like I have to give this a negative review because your typical 360 gamer is going to get so pissed off trying to play this game.
1131638	1134659	Because there are so many hurdles that you have to clear.
1135099	1139160	And for a PC gamer, which is where I started the game, it's okay.
1139720	1140321	And for...
1141721	1142462	PlayOnlineHurdle.com
1161579	1166302	And I understand it's necessary to get the game to be compatible with PC and PlayStation 2.
1166342	1167003	I'm not an idiot.
1167043	1167863	I know why it's there.
1168183	1170505	But I'm saying it really cripples the game.
1170865	1174207	I'm telling you, you cannot turn on this game and just go and play.
1174928	1176609	It takes, literally, I'm going to time it.
1176629	1178430	We're going to put a video up on the website.
1178470	1185715	I'm going to time it and show you that it takes well over a minute from the time you turn on your Xbox for you to actually log into the game.
1186195	1187696	That is really annoying.
1188117	1191279	I'm sorry, there's no easy way to just get in there and go.
1191319	1201528	You've got to go through that ugly play online thing, which really, they need some type of quick button or something where I just go right into Final Fantasy XI and start with my primary character or something.
1202389	1203069	Here's the other thing.
1203370	1207473	I was so excited to play Final Fantasy XI on my HDTV because, you know, widescreen.
1207693	1210155	And don't get me wrong, the game is very, very pretty.
1210756	1212617	And it looks very nice and it's very colorful.
1212677	1214339	The text is blurry!
1215188	1218150	The text is blurry on an HDTV.
1218390	1221972	You cannot make out the number of hit points my character has in the corner.
1222412	1226954	Yes, I've tried adjusting my TV settings, contrast, brightness, all that stuff.
1227355	1230116	I didn't have to adjust it for any other Xbox game I own.
1230796	1234358	And even in adjusting it, I can't get it to look the way it does on my computer.
1235479	1236259	It's annoying.
1236460	1237360	I couldn't believe it.
1238461	1238941	So I...
1240333	1255024	Even though I might once in a while play Final Fantasy XI on my Xbox 360 and I'm kind of screwed where I can't take it back really, I can't recommend this game because I think people that play Xbox 360 that want to get into role-playing games are honestly going to want something more like Oblivion.
1255084	1255625	Yes, Andrew?
1256005	1260668	Speaking of which, how many massive RPGs does the Xbox 360 have?
1260709	1261329	I can name one.
1261469	1261929	Oblivion.
1262570	1262730	No, no.
1262790	1263851	Oblivion is not a massive game.
1264371	1265672	It's just a massive RPG.
1265692	1266053	Okay, sorry.
1266113	1266613	Huge RPG.
1266693	1267834	Not massively multiplayer.
1267874	1268735	Just huge RPG.
1268995	1269175	Right.
1270451	1275475	Personally, I don't think the Xbox 360 caters to that type of gamer, at least not yet.
1276155	1290184	I mean, I've done a little bit of lurking on forums for the 360 version of Final Fantasy XI, and these people who have played the demo are just pissed off that it's not the fast type of game that they're used to, like, say, Halo.
1291145	1295288	It's not what the people who buy a 360 would typically enjoy.
1295308	1298410	So the community might take a hit on that.
1298757	1312670	and also the thing that we should all be pissed off about, other than the fact, granted it's not $60, it's still $50, which is still way too much, the fact they didn't do anything with it, the graphics don't look any better, the resolutions aren't any higher.
1313072	1314033	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1331670	1336854	Compress the guide button and get custom soundtracks from CDs they've ripped or their computer if they took a little extra effort.
1337995	1346682	And the fact that you could do live chat and the whole Xbox 360 interface is kind of neat, although I imagine most PC players are already doing Ventrilo anyway, so it doesn't matter.
1347242	1355288	But I think the price is actually right, because considering you get the expansion with the game and everything, I think the price is fair.
1355308	1357129	I think $50 is a fair price for the game.
1358050	1365354	I've been reading stories on the internet where people are pissed off that there's an extra $12.95 fee to go with the game.
1365374	1366494	It's an MMO, dumbass.
1366614	1367035	Seriously.
1367075	1367995	I couldn't believe it.
1368035	1370496	I don't know if I was reading on Joystick, Kotaku, one of those sites.
1370556	1372697	Yeah, it was just some retard that didn't realize.
1373138	1381042	It says right on the box in the upper left-hand corner, required internet connection, monthly fee.
1381102	1383223	It says right on the box in small print.
1383993	1384754	Anarchy Online, Guild Wars,
1407990	1409191	I can name the third one, RuneScape
1436866	1438207	It sucks, but it's popular.
1438227	1441009	Or Ragnarok on pirated servers, which is what most people are doing.
1441209	1442730	I guess I forgot to mention.
1445652	1447753	Oh, God, now the chat room is just flooding there.
1448094	1448594	Guild Wars.
1448614	1449575	Yeah, I already said Guild Wars.
1449635	1450455	MapleStory.
1450675	1451516	Oh, I forgot about MapleStory.
1451536	1451996	Okay, fair enough.
1452276	1453537	All right, so maybe there's a few.
1453737	1461362	But come on, the popular ones, World of Warcraft, Lineage, EverQuest, Final Fantasy, they all have monthly fees.
1462243	1464965	Guild Wars is probably the most popular one that doesn't have a monthly fee.
1465376	1466257	And Guild Wars is a good game.
1466537	1467077	I like Guild Wars.
1468559	1472622	But anyway, I can't believe that some guy was stupid to not think there was going to be this extra monthly fee.
1472922	1475684	Even Phantasy Star Online on the Xbox had a monthly fee.
1476185	1478306	And it's a bitch to cancel, might I add.
1478707	1481489	They will not just stop billing you when you stop playing.
1481549	1482489	It's pretty annoying.
1485836	1487177	Anyway, so I'm sorry.
1487397	1491660	I think the only way folks are going to like this game on 360 is if they know what they're in for.
1491680	1495323	And there's probably Final Fantasy XI fans all ready to write me an angry email.
1495763	1498845	Okay, well, look, I play Final Fantasy a lot too.
1499526	1508432	I knew what I was kind of in for on the Xbox, but I'm trying to look at this as a game that people who have an Xbox 360 and maybe have never played an MMO before...
1508732	1512194	because Microsoft fans really probably haven't played an MMO before.
1512214	1518516	If you're exclusively an Xbox or Xbox 360 owner, you probably haven't played an MMO before unless you played Phantasy Star.
1519077	1520958	But you certainly haven't played anything about Final Fantasy XI.
1521218	1524119	This is not the most user-friendly introduction of these games.
1524239	1526120	It's probably going to turn a lot of people off to it in the future.
1527011	1527211	All right.
1527231	1527471	All right.
1555071	1555432	I like this.
1556313	1557695	Chat room comments here.
1558035	1562202	BlackWolf again says, Dear Sky, your review made me a sad panda.
1562602	1563704	Love, Sephiroth420Rules.
1568180	1572863	If you think MMOs with people named Sephiroth are bad, log into Final Fantasy sometime.
1572883	1575645	You'll see Sephiroth and Sephiroth.
1575665	1577066	Legolas, Drist, everyone.
1577086	1584690	You'll see Tidus and Una, Unia, Unilesca.
1584910	1587472	Change one letter from a popular character and you got it.
1587492	1587892	Everything.
1588493	1588973	Everything.
1590822	1600592	Alright, so, sorry guys, I think the only way I would recommend Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 to you is if you've played it on another system and you already know what you're in for, because you better be patient.
1600812	1603655	And you better make sure you have a USB keyboard.
1603935	1608759	And if you don't believe me, a timed video will be coming to OLRPSP.com very soon.
1609700	1614325	You should see the installation time, let alone... It was an hour to install, and then that doesn't even count the patching.
1615046	1619988	Yeah, so... I remember the beta, and then trying to find how to take the beta off the hard drive.
1620068	1620609	That was great.
1620829	1621229	You know what, though?
1621289	1625051	On PC, it didn't bother me, because I expect that type of thing from PC games.
1625331	1635516	That's why I think Final Fantasy XI is a great game on PC, and I think it's passable on PlayStation 2, because PlayStation 2 doesn't have any nice Xbox Live-type service, so I think people had to expect something like that.
1635756	1636756	But Xbox 360?
1636916	1637917	People are going to be in for a shock.
1638017	1638697	Okay, I'm done.
1638737	1639918	I don't want to talk about Final Fantasy XI anymore.
1640934	1641814	Andrew, what have you been playing?
1641894	1642555	How was your gaming week?
1642755	1643855	Oh, how was my gaming year?
1643935	1644095	No.
1645056	1645896	No, just this week.
1646276	1646936	All right, all right.
1647036	1649858	I've been getting into guitar here a little bit more.
1650238	1652118	I've got two more songs to go on Expert.
1652539	1656840	Just can't pass Bark in the Moon or Cowboys from Hell, but it's been a lot of progress.
1657500	1662122	I've been playing World of Warcraft, happily almost 57 Rogue on Maelstrom.
1662562	1664583	Doing a couple of Black Rod.
1664883	1665083	See?
1665143	1666024	Blue, brew, brew.
1666991	1672755	Blackrock Depths runs, 2 of 8 on Shadowcraft, trying to get myself in a high-end rating guild once I hit 60.
1674636	1680640	Been playing some Rez, trying to get into that, can't pass level 5, but the game is just uber trippy.
1680820	1684842	I'm ashamed of myself that I didn't get into it the first time it came around.
1687084	1693788	Actually, there's not much else that I can really say about how I was my week, but World of Warcraft is awesome and is getting better all the time.
1695768	1696268	Thank you for watching.
1696288	1696789	See you next time.
1715498	1718220	against the raid boss of the expansion.
1718460	1720942	I still want the panda people.
1721503	1722063	Pandarins?
1722623	1725045	Pandarins probably won't make it.
1725686	1726767	I know, but I still want it.
1727187	1727507	Oh, yeah.
1727967	1728728	Isn't it nice to want it?
1728788	1732651	Hopefully they'll announce some NPCs, Pandarins, over in Outland.
1732691	1733792	You think we'll find out at E3?
1733812	1735913	You think Blizzard's just sitting on it for E3 now?
1736214	1742378	I know that they were definitely holding out on it until April Fool's Day so they could unveil...
1744401	1745341	That was a little silly.
1745361	1746462	That was a little silly.
1765450	1771153	All right, well, just looking at some more comments in our chat room here over at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
1771173	1772153	Click on chat.
1772633	1776355	YouWillBowToMe says, 50% of MMO names have Sephiroth in them.
1776375	1777996	The other 50% have 420 in them.
1778536	1779236	That's very true.
1780016	1780357	Let's see.
1780777	1781537	Who said the thing about 69?
1782057	1785819	Oh, DJPooEater says, 69 is always a popular name to use as well.
1786159	1787340	So, very.
1787380	1789801	What are other popular MMO names I see all the time?
1789881	1794303	Yeah, Legolas is always like Dan L. Name Legolas.
1795843	1799585	We're going to move on and get into some gaming news this week.
1800346	1802587	First to start off, we're going to talk about release dates, right Loki?
1802907	1803207	Of course.
1803447	1805728	Loki got some more release dates he wants to share with you guys.
1805768	1807369	Remember that these are all tentative.
1807669	1813752	But first, if you still don't believe us on these release date things, two things got confirmed this week.
1813832	1818935	First off, Nintendo Power's recent issue, their cover, and what's on the cover of the latest Nintendo Power?
1819414	1830261	Castlevania, Portrait of... whatever Portrait of Ruin, for those people that said Orange Lounge Radio is pulling that name out of their ass Nope, there it is, confirmed by Nintendo Power Portrait of Ruin, and what was the other thing?
1830281	1846811	There was the Tony Hawk game you mentioned like a month ago Tony Hawk, Downhill Jam, it was part of the Destination PlayStation news I did on those mini-podcasts that we had And apparently no one paid attention to any of that stuff Because they just released all that same info as new this week
1847389	1849330	Well, we're a no-name site, remember.
1849390	1854794	Yeah, including the PSP 50 Cent game, the Eragon game.
1856035	1857275	Let me see what was on my list here.
1862619	1867742	The Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which I think at the time I was calling it Marvel Legends.
1867782	1870164	That was the working name.
1871085	1873306	And what else was there?
1873406	1874887	Oh, the gun for PSP.
1874907	1876168	Um...
1877310	1878350	What else do we have here?
1879951	1881011	I don't know.
1881111	1883812	I think that's pretty much all the major stuff that they're talking about.
1883832	1884612	Oh, Miami Vice.
1884652	1885772	They were talking about that coming out.
1886153	1891454	Well, let me reaffirm a few more things since I said them before and now people are starting to listen a little bit.
1891674	1893755	Here's a few more that they still have not mentioned.
1893795	1896655	Okay, so granted we have Tony Hawk.
1896736	1897736	These are all new this week?
1898316	1900517	Well, this is stuff I said before.
1900757	1904198	Okay, so before we said Tony Hawk's downhill jam for the revolution.
1904258	1905478	Okay, well that's still coming.
1906076	1910477	Marvel Ultimate Alliance is coming on the Revolution, probably at launch.
1910937	1911758	So that should be good.
1912438	1917539	We're also having on the PSP, Pimp My Ride the Game.
1917619	1918639	Remember, I said this before.
1918659	1926001	Pimp My Ride the Game coming to the Xbox 360 and PSP, among other joy and rapture.
1926061	1926982	So remember that.
1927162	1929282	Pimp My Ride the Game coming.
1929342	1931563	Call of Duty is going to be coming to the PSP.
1932170	1933331	at some point as well.
1933751	1938753	And of course, Call of Duty 3 on the PS3 and Xbox 360 and all that stuff.
1938874	1940074	Not a big surprise there.
1940174	1941735	All right, tell us the new ones already.
1941755	1945137	I want to hear the new ones that you posted this week on the site and no one noticed.
1945517	1952941	Okay, well anyways, the ones I posted, starting off with Itoy Play 3, which is coming out.
1953041	1953861	Okay, get to the good stuff.
1956483	1958604	Okay, SOCOM combined assault.
1958644	1960545	This was also announced on other sites too.
1960950	1964852	They're talking about this game coming out and that's actually supposed to be coming out on November 15th.
1965852	1971956	Gangs of London, which is the Getaway series spinoff, that's coming also on November 15th.
1972396	1976838	SOCOM Fireteam Bravo 2, also on the 15th on the PSP.
1977658	1983441	The next Ratchet and Clank game coming to the PSP, that's actually in 2007 on Valentine's Day.
1984202	1990685	And the day after that, God of War 2 will be coming out on February 15th, which is awesome.
1991544	2019967	and there are some sports games as well NBA 07 coming out in October on PS2 Rogue Galaxy on October 4th and then if you're an ATV fan ATV Off-Road Fury 4 coming out on PlayStation 2 September 27th and ATV Off-Road Fury Pro on the PSP on October 18th which is going to be pretty cool then from Square Enix
2021669	2031155	Valkyrie Profile Lenneth Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Cerebus Final Fantasy XII for the United States September 12th Release dates always subject to change Especially with Squeenix
2051788	2060015	Yeah, so this is what is currently... Stuff could move around, but this is going to be the information everyone has right now until we hear otherwise.
2060615	2061576	Well, good job, Loki.
2061636	2064298	Keep your ears out there for any other release dates coming up to E3.
2064318	2065519	There's another one, too.
2065599	2070323	I think in September, LEGO Star Wars 2, the original trilogy, is coming out.
2071144	2072325	That was the other one I thought was kind of cool.
2073666	2075267	But I'm just saying, you know, we had...
2075822	2077945	A lot of the stuff from Destination PlayStation.
2078246	2081410	See, no one was reporting on it because no one went to Destination PlayStation.
2081450	2082772	It's only a retail-only event.
2084608	2089770	Well, keep your ears out there in the retail scene so we can, you know, before people catch on that, you know, that's where we're getting our news.
2093512	2095452	Anyway, let's get into some other news tonight.
2095552	2100074	Talk about games that are officially announced by the company, even though we all knew it was coming.
2100114	2103296	Guitar Hero 2 was officially announced.
2103436	2104376	It's going to be coming out.
2105156	2108798	Guitar Hero 2 was announced earlier, I guess a press conference or something like that, by...
2109518	2110158	Red Octane.
2110178	2113179	And of course there's even a little interview that you can look at over on IGN.
2113199	2115039	They have a whole little thing going on there.
2116099	2120720	And they're going to be able to do the lead guitar, rhythm guitar, and bass guitar.
2121241	2124241	And so they have it separated into all those different tracks as well.
2125161	2129722	And there's going to be, I guess, the multiplayer as well where you can kind of do the separate things going on.
2132523	2133103	I'm just going to
2133661	2135303	Really quickly derailed this train.
2135683	2142449	Before anyone starts calling this innovative, let me remind you Guitar Freaks has been doing this for years with the whole bass track.
2143690	2144391	In a way, in a way.
2145091	2147213	About 55 songs are supposed to be in the game.
2147233	2151257	They're saying also more difficult songs for folks that have mastered the original.
2151737	2156281	And, of course, the multiplayer co-op, which I also hinted at before, that will be coming as well.
2156401	2160765	No song hints, but we're imagining there's going to be a demo D3 that ought to give some of that away.
2161471	2169295	That and they're also saying that now that they're able, that it's had such a success with the original, they're able to get bigger name bands now before they were like, huh?
2169316	2170376	That's good.
2170856	2176340	Maybe a multi-platform at some point would be nice, but don't hold your breath because that means I have to do new controllers, but we'll see.
2177100	2178961	Of course, it will work with the old controller.
2178981	2181883	They're not going to screw you into getting a new controller, which is good news, I'm sure.
2182543	2183924	So, we shall see.
2184824	2186645	I'm hoping for some GWAR myself.
2186785	2191248	I would love to see that in Guitar Hero, complete with the costumed people, like, you know, just
2191854	2193154	Crowdsurfing and all that would be hot.
2195515	2199136	Loki, another confirmation of something I believe we rumored last week, correct?
2199736	2205518	Yeah, Sony has actually lowered the price of the PS2 down to $129.99 retail.
2207098	2208819	And that's not really much of a surprise.
2209359	2213560	And it's effective as of, you know, last week, basically.
2214441	2215901	And, you know,
2216277	2216497	and so on.
2244440	2244740	Awesome.
2244840	2247182	So, no $99 yet, though, huh?
2248102	2248443	Give it time.
2248463	2251465	You've got probably Christmas around PS3 launch.
2252545	2253006	About the time.
2253886	2254987	You know what's interesting, though?
2255007	2259250	$129 is also the cost of a DS, because I lost that bet with Extifer.
2259450	2263853	Today was six months since we'd made a bet, and I had to buy his DS today, and that's how much I paid for it.
2264013	2263853	$129.
2264793	2267695	So, DS will cost you just as much as a PlayStation.
2268235	2270517	That is until the next DS price drop, which I'm sure is
2271568	2272989	Maybe around the time the light comes out?
2273029	2273389	I don't know.
2273409	2273709	Probably.
2273729	2274069	Who knows?
2274449	2274749	Who knows?
2276390	2278370	Big, big rumor going around this week.
2278390	2282532	This is from a site, pro-g.co.uk.
2282972	2289014	Is Xbox Live Arcade going to get MAME games as well as Sega games?
2289414	2290514	That could be very interesting.
2291895	2300738	There's a Microsoft source, but of course they can't say who, that says, quote, Xbox Live Arcade has seen some pretty serious deal-making in this first quarter.
2301038	2302199	It's been a real priority.
2302459	2311806	The deal-making has been a no-brainer for everyone we've spoken to, and aside from a few licensing issues with existing products, Xbox Live Arcade is going to smash Nintendo's virtual console to pieces.
2312227	2315189	Keep in mind, that's coming from a Microsoft source, so it's a little bit biased.
2315690	2316790	Well, here the quote goes on.
2316830	2317631	I think this is interesting.
2318091	2320733	You've heard of the MAME, or I'm sorry, you've heard of MAME, right?
2321514	2328837	We're just doing a legal version of MAME, meaning that all the game owners get paid and the users get quality product based around a community.
2329237	2332519	Imagine the biggest arcade in the world just a thousand times bigger.
2332839	2337541	It'll have as many machines as we can possibly get, all with score rankings and other community stuff.
2337841	2345184	It's not a secret that MAME was massive for hackers of the original Xbox, and the pull in sales of retro game packs on current machines is still really high.
2345544	2349826	If this is taken and put under the right noses, it should become the biggest thing in mainstream
2350086	2352359	Hardcore Gamer Crossover in the industry
2352947	2355069	They're also saying that Sega's going to jump on board.
2355429	2357430	Sega games will be included in a major way.
2357510	2362414	It's a surprising addition to the deal and will include games that Nintendo will also be selling.
2362454	2365036	The Nintendo deal, not exclusive.
2365456	2367978	Again, take that with a big grain of salt there.
2368579	2370820	The MAME thing is a little hard for me to get.
2370940	2373342	I can see maybe using some of the same code.
2373662	2376384	I just couldn't see them calling it MAME on the Xbox.
2376945	2379326	Hello, they've already got arcade games on there.
2379366	2380287	They're the same thing.
2380327	2381328	I mean, look, Gauntlet.
2381508	2383069	Smash TV, Robotron.
2384029	2386130	But those games take a little extra that MAME doesn't.
2386170	2393893	I mean, because those games have co-op and they have, you know, the Xbox Live achievements and rankings and things that MAME doesn't exactly have programmed into it.
2394994	2398715	I think it would be stupid for them to put like thousands of games on there.
2398755	2403417	I mean, I just... I don't because I think that's what Nintendo plans to do.
2403898	2404638	Slowly but surely.
2404818	2405178	I don't know.
2406519	2409200	MAME doesn't seem like a good way to do it.
2410580	2416163	I think the idea is there, like they're going to be bringing more arcade games.
2416943	2418644	I don't think it's called MAME.
2418684	2420085	They're not going to call it MAME.
2420725	2421046	I don't know.
2421106	2431151	But that's, again, I know what it's like, and you know what it's like to be on the other side when you're the site reporting the rumor and have everybody going, oh, you guys are liars.
2431771	2433012	So I don't know.
2434192	2435613	I think the Sega thing is true.
2435653	2437234	I don't see why that wouldn't be true.
2437794	2438995	It makes complete sense to me.
2439595	2439956	Whatever.
2439996	2443138	As long as they put good games on there.
2445360	2446621	Where's all my gal's pen of games?
2446822	2449024	That's what we need on Xbox Live Arcade.
2449304	2450605	Problem for Microsoft, though.
2450665	2452567	People are still going to use MAME.
2453067	2455990	People are still going to hack their Xboxes and put MAME on there.
2456190	2458592	People are still going to use MAME on their PCs.
2458632	2459813	People are still going to do that.
2459953	2462836	Most people that probably have a 360 probably own a PC.
2462936	2464697	And they'll be like, wow, MAME on my 360.
2465898	2467439	Uh, no, I think I'll just play it for free.
2467479	2468200	Wait a minute, though.
2468220	2468800	Wait, wait, wait a minute.
2468820	2474905	Because Gauntlet is still a great selling game because many of those people are also achievement point whores.
2475225	2478848	So they will buy the game to get 200 achievement points or however many they can squeeze out of it.
2479969	2480189	Huh?
2480209	2488575	Yeah, and by the way, getting achievement points out of Xbox Live arcade games is retarded because it's freaking hard.
2489875	2492156	Comments from our chatroom, Orange Lounge Radio, click on chat.
2492176	2493816	The time point ratio sucks.
2493916	2496697	Phoenix Rising says, I want Neo Geo on live.
2496717	2498578	And also says, Blaster Master for live.
2498698	2499338	Ooh, that's a good one.
2500779	2503400	Fireboma says, the Simpsons arcade game is a classic.
2503460	2506181	Ooh, that's something that definitely should be on Xbox Live.
2506201	2506781	That would be awesome.
2506901	2508501	Well, they were talking about the Ninja Turtles game.
2509942	2510182	Maybe.
2510482	2511082	Ooh, that would be cool.
2512123	2512503	We shall see.
2512523	2512783	I'd play that.
2514023	2514323	All right.
2516584	2518945	Moving on, going to the next topic.
2519045	2519325	Loki.
2521245	2525387	Anyways, um, I can't believe Mame freaking retarded.
2527388	2540177	Anyways, um, so yes, there's this whole thing that was actually out in one of my nice retail industry magazines talking about this brand new Microsoft portable system that is in the works right now.
2540697	2542538	Codename the X-Player.
2543539	2548622	It's expected to arrive in 2007, possibly something they announce at E3.
2549222	2549943	Anyways, um,
2550325	2561668	The X-Player is in development in Redmond, Washington, according to Dean Takahashi, author of the upcoming Spider-Works Press book, The Xbox 360 Uncloaked.
2562348	2566169	Takahashi previously wrote inside the Xbox for Prima.
2567790	2571151	It basically has good sources inside Microsoft.
2572051	2578473	Basically, they're kind of confirming the original rumor, saying Jay Allard and his team...
2579315	2580595	X-Player with this iTunes-like store.
2609707	2610007	I don't know.
2611148	2611588	Interesting.
2611628	2622215	But it says Microsoft recently signed a deal with Epic Records, which is to bring their music exclusively to Xbox Live.
2622796	2623836	Actually, their music videos.
2623997	2627899	I think we've been seeing that, actually, with the stuff that they've had on live right now.
2628019	2630121	So it should be interesting.
2630341	2638066	But this is coming straight out of, well, not a magazine most people would be reading, but let's see here.
2638914	2643776	Home Media Retailing for all those wonderful video retailers out there.
2646196	2646857	Sorry, I had my mic off.
2646877	2650198	I was going to say, interesting, is that just another fancy name for the origami?
2650538	2651798	Because that's what our chat room seems to think.
2651858	2652758	No, it's not the origami.
2653339	2654359	Something completely different.
2654379	2655959	It hasn't come out yet.
2655979	2657460	2007 for this.
2657660	2660961	And this is something that I've heard earlier was being worked on.
2661041	2665102	So if you're looking for a bomb to be dropped at E3, here it is.
2665983	2666643	Interesting.
2666803	2667183	I know.
2667925	2674287	I find it interesting that in every article like that, it says it's going to be a PSP killer.
2674307	2675687	They're going to compete directly with Sony.
2675707	2684349	You notice they're not... Microsoft hasn't tried to compete directly with Nintendo, whether they think Nintendo is just beneath them or just not on the league.
2684589	2687530	They always try to go for the brute force approach and try to out...
2688030	2714331	Outpower the other systems That's because Microsoft's trying to create a Trojan horse entertainment system That's basically going to get into your house You buy the 360 because you want to play games on it But oh look, now it also records TV Oh look, now I can download videos from the internet Oh look, now I can download movies from the internet And oh look, now it's the center of my entertainment in my household Basically kind of what Sony's doing also Except being less shady Well, I don't know what less shady about it, but
2714827	2723390	you know slightly less shady about it um that's what they kind of want to do with the PSP because well the PSP UMD movie sucked and that didn't really take off but um
2723956	2730937	This whole e-distribution thing that they're planning on doing with the PSP, well, sure, Microsoft wants to get a piece of that action.
2731318	2731958	I mean, why not?
2732118	2735778	They think that they can defeat Sony in the console world.
2735818	2738439	Why not try to defeat them in the handheld market?
2738519	2744520	And to be honest, they don't really see the Nintendo DS as a threat because it's not playing movies or music or anything like that.
2744740	2745941	So it's just a gaming system.
2746201	2751962	Well, you've got two companies who market their products as able to do everything, and they have one...
2752802	2753242	Thanks for watching!
2774352	2776272	It's not very easy to browse with, let me put it that way.
2776753	2777333	You can use it.
2777733	2778473	It's great.
2779013	2781113	Not enough people designed just for the PSP.
2781153	2783794	I think there's a lot to be milked out of the PSP.
2784434	2786634	And I think you're going to see some pretty innovative things coming soon.
2786714	2787515	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
2787855	2788075	Oh, yeah.
2788415	2788595	All right.
2790135	2790435	Anyway.
2791695	2793416	And then, yeah, comments from our chat room.
2793436	2797517	Jada2006 says, OLR PSP looks awesome on Firefox.
2797577	2799697	Well, look, we don't design it for Firefox.
2801405	2804980	Speaking of which, OLRPSP does have a brand new video that I've uploaded.
2805433	2809897	Straight from the bachelor party is me playing Mario Kart GP.
2810437	2815962	And to be honest, what you see on the video is all I remember of it because I don't remember actually playing the game.
2816322	2817363	I've just watched the video.
2817743	2819404	Yeah, Gizm just asked about that in chat.
2819444	2820425	That video is up.
2820485	2823508	It just went up before the show started tonight, the Mario Kart video.
2823548	2824969	So check that out.
2825209	2826150	Did you lose a sock?
2826270	2827291	Comment from our chat room.
2827631	2829653	You can't have the origami in the X player.
2829713	2832975	Microsoft is backing the origami or the UMPC so much.
2833055	2833876	Why would they back both?
2834329	2839032	Because that one's a PC, this is an actual video game console.
2839993	2840413	Interesting.
2841294	2842295	Other comments in the chatroom.
2842335	2846278	YouWillBowToMe says, $50 says the X-Playo will be the size of a fucking brick.
2846938	2849960	And SpiritSnare says, $60 the X-Playo will be big.
2850881	2852022	Play on the word big there.
2852262	2854824	Like big as in, you know, brick.
2855004	2857766	Here's my other question is, what will G4 think of this?
2858755	2859215	Who cares?
2859416	2860676	Because it has X-Playing.
2861037	2869302	Well, Fireboma thinks it'll be the great repetitive jokes and sarcasm from Morgan Webb and Adam Sessler trying to piss you off more and more until you get better just as you can stop playing.
2869523	2870103	But you know what?
2870123	2871164	We're complete.
2871204	2871724	You know what?
2871944	2873926	I forgot who's going to dominate the market.
2874206	2876808	The brand new Phantom.
2877328	2878449	No, not the Phantom.
2878869	2879249	N-Gage 2.0
2896246	2897347	The pile of crap.
2897747	2899728	It's a big, smelly, engaged boot.
2900389	2903271	Big, smelly, engaged boot.
2903291	2904712	So bring your hazmat suits.
2905732	2911897	Yes, Loki, DarkSakura, and I are going to E3 this year, and we will be bringing you extensive coverage.
2911917	2914258	You don't even know what we've got planned for you guys.
2915339	2917780	I really hope you guys are satisfied with what we're bringing you this year.
2918021	2919962	We're bringing you more than daily podcasts this year.
2920002	2920762	Let's just put it this way.
2921243	2921863	It's going to be great.
2922424	2922864	We're excited.
2923344	2924465	All right, moving on.
2926058	2927839	Let's see, wanted to go to this story.
2927879	2929821	This is something that's been floating around the internet.
2929861	2931902	It originally started over at IGN.
2932663	2936186	Again, people feel the need to put together a top ten list, but this one's a little bit funny.
2936226	2940189	It's a top ten worst in-game quotes of all time.
2940489	2942651	Before I read any off the list, what would you guys think?
2943411	2945653	Die, Monster, you don't belong in this world.
2945693	2946813	Die, Monster from Castlevania.
2946833	2947494	What do you think, Loki?
2947654	2948895	The truck have started to move.
2948915	2950816	The truck have started to move from Metal Gear.
2950836	2951957	Well, here it is, their top ten.
2952357	2954759	Shine Get from Super Mario Sunshine.
2955159	2957481	Number nine, A Winner Is You from Pro Wrestling.
2958081	2960983	Number eight, The Donkey Kong Rap from Donkey Kong 64.
2961023	2961764	All right, all right.
2962684	2966847	Number seven, You Can't Give It Up, Triumph or Die from Street Fighter Alpha 3.
2967227	2969889	Number six, I Feel Asleep from Metal Gear.
2969929	2970129	Metal Gear.
2972085	2975286	5.
2972305	2975286	Yo Gangsta, get ready to gangbang from Busta Groove 4.
2976826	2981667	You were doomed as soon as you lost the ability to love from Castlevania Symphony of the Night 3.
2983368	2989129	Jill, why don't you, the master of unlocking, take this lockpick from Resident Evil 2.
2990509	2993250	I am Error from Zelda II The Adventures of Link 1.
2994938	2996759	All your base are belong to us.
2996799	2997259	Of course.
2997940	2999480	What about Are You Enjoy?
3000661	3001521	That is not on the list.
3002522	3004143	What is that one game on MAME?
3004163	3007885	Speaking of MAME, there's nothing like Frying Over the Jungle or something like that.
3009265	3011367	Brad or somebody was showing me that game not that long ago.
3011387	3014328	I'm sure people in the chat room will light up with it or on email.
3014368	3016089	But yeah, there's that one too that I think about.
3016349	3019591	I see a notable lack of the president has been kidnapped by ninjas.
3019631	3021492	Are you a bad enough dude to save the president?
3021752	3022292	Oh, there you go.
3022472	3023873	That's just bad dialogue, not necessarily.
3024750	3025511	I'm a bad enough dude.
3051943	3058828	Yes, there was a big E3 email that went out, and one of the things on there was something mentioning The Revolution.
3059449	3060850	And what was it, you may ask?
3061030	3069877	Well, it's going to be a flight game put out by Hudson Soft, and of course, we can only speculate what that's going to be like, but it should be fun, at least.
3070317	3076942	Of course, more Revolution stuff going to be shown at E3, you know, playable demos of Red Steel and that type of thing, but...
3078042	3079703	Always looking for more innovative stuff.
3079743	3081624	Maybe this is the next Pilotwings.
3082024	3085945	To be honest, I don't remember Hudson's off putting out Pilotwings, so I doubt that.
3088246	3090227	Didn't Hudson have something to do, though, with Smash Bros.
3090267	3090547	Melee?
3092088	3092908	Maybe, I want to say.
3092948	3094529	That was Hal Labs, not Hudson.
3095149	3103853	Well, anyways, basically they said you're going to be taking this guy's way that you've never experienced before on any home console using the Revolution's gesture system.
3104571	3133338	which I don't remember what the gesture system is but I imagine it has something to do with the controller built into their innovative controller Hudson's new flight game allows total plane control as players pilot their planes through various acrobatic flight maneuvers ranging from sky artistry to bomb drops alright they should have like a paper airplane controller attachment or something something innovative there
3134773	3135474	Yeah, a little different.
3136095	3139782	Alright, this is the part of the show where we would have done the mailbag.
3139922	3141565	However, DarkSakura is not here.
3142526	3142966	Thanks for watching!
3165219	3166360	We have some pretty funny listeners.
3167921	3171963	Actually, because we leave comments on people's journals, and we have about four pictures that we cycle through.
3172204	3181069	We're trying to add a couple more to be original, but some people have actually been parroting those pictures and then reposting them back on our MySpace, which has been pretty funny, so we appreciate that sense of humor.
3182110	3185092	I'm going to read a message I got here, and I'm not sure the guy's real name.
3185172	3187373	It's Classy Plastic Lumber.
3187734	3189535	Plastic Lumber is his display name right now.
3190235	3191076	You guys rock.
3191997	3197040	But yeah, I've been listening to your show since the PSP got the RSS feature, and I'm just now trying to listen in live.
3197120	3203323	I have the Java chat working well, and I'm still working on the live stream, so hopefully I'll listen in on Sunday, and you should see me in the chat.
3204384	3206945	And he gives his nickname there, and let me see, did he make it into chat?
3208007	3210208	He did not make it into chat, so unfortunately he failed.
3210248	3214170	So here's a little help on how to listen to our show live, for those of you guys that want to do so.
3214831	3222655	Head on over to www.orangehauntrader.com, and there's actually a little picture with the Live365 logo, and if you click on that...
3223495	3225936	on Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
3225996	3227517	That's how you can tune into us live.
3227877	3234579	Keep in mind, we actually go live at 5.30 and we can only have 50 slots for people to listen live.
3234639	3235700	We only have 50 slots.
3236380	3237881	And that's been filling up lately.
3237981	3243082	So we're looking at alternatives on how we can get more slots without having to pay an assload.
3243783	3246384	So that's going to be coming soon, hopefully.
3246424	3246984	But for right now...
3247344	3247765	DarkSakura.com
3265143	3266825	So you can listen to that, and then we're live.
3266865	3270470	And we're here from 6 o'clock till about 8 o'clock, 8.30, whenever we finish.
3271070	3275957	And then we do a bonus live show called The Afterbirth, which is just, it's insanity.
3275997	3277298	We don't even really talk about games.
3277358	3281083	We just talk about, it's dick and fart jokes and other fun stuff, whatever we feel like.
3281423	3282745	So tune in for that.
3282785	3283306	It's a good time.
3284608	3298397	Alright, so again, if you want to send us an actual email, it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and maybe we'll read some of those on whatever we do next week, because I think we're going to do like a mini-show or something, even though we won't be here live, and then definitely we'll get all caught up on that when we come back.
3299077	3301499	I want to say May 1st is that show?
3301559	3302539	No, I guess a little after.
3302559	3305261	It's going to be the one right before E3, May 7th is when we'll be back.
3305301	3308123	It'll be our big E3 preview show, so look forward to that.
3309315	3310096	Yeah, alright.
3311136	3316760	Moving on, let's go back over to Loki, who is going to tell us about a very popular series getting a sequel.
3317380	3320662	Yes, Command & Conquer 3, it's Hiberian Wars.
3321322	3327906	It's been officially announced by EA, and basically kind of picking up where the last game left off.
3328147	3333530	It takes place in 2047, and will feature the latest in RTS technology.
3334390	3336852	Also featuring the GDI, the Brotherhood of Nod.
3337612	3338453	Just looks pretty...
3338800	3339240	Pretty cool.
3339641	3341442	And I'm a huge Command & Conquer fan.
3341903	3347627	I really hoped they'd bring it over to the 360, especially Red Alert.
3347887	3349108	I loved Red Alert.
3349629	3352251	But anyways, so that should be coming soon.
3352872	3354273	Hopefully we'll see that at E3.
3354913	3356094	Hope I get to check it out.
3357095	3358836	And it looks pretty cool.
3362700	3363020	Alright.
3363861	3365862	Oh, it's coming out in 2007 for Windows PC.
3366723	3366803	So.
3367884	3369085	Look for that, Command & Conquer fan.
3369105	3370545	That's a series I just couldn't get into.
3370625	3371826	I understand why people love it.
3371906	3373846	It's just a certain genre of game I don't really play.
3373866	3374367	You know what, though?
3374467	3378648	I loved it for a different reason other than the fact that I loved it because you can customize it.
3378668	3387252	Because you can actually mod it using this thing called the rules.ini file and I can make my own custom troops that were really powerful and stuff and just completely cheat in the game.
3387332	3389012	But it made it fun because you could do that.
3389053	3393674	You could send that file to somebody else, play online and play with those customized troops.
3394755	3397216	And I thought that was really cool, the whole customization part of it.
3397536	3397696	But
3398442	3400405	NAMCO BANDAI
3415196	3415656	Project Gotham Racing 3
3444850	3447192	You know, I mean, just that much better.
3447452	3453797	And that's pretty bad if that's a first-gen game and they're already doing what Project Gotham did.
3454318	3454598	Easy.
3454958	3457200	I mean, I don't know.
3457240	3457620	We'll see.
3458101	3458981	I think it's going to be awesome.
3459242	3460923	And I'm looking forward to it.
3461083	3463785	I didn't see... I loved Ridge Racer 6.
3464586	3468229	Granted, they haven't changed anything since Ridge Racer 4.
3469790	3471131	Or even maybe before that, but...
3471977	3472477	So what?
3472677	3475979	You know, it's still the same game, it's good, it's fun.
3476419	3480020	Burnout, haven't changed anything in Burnout except for the cars that have bad AI.
3480361	3485503	Not my favorite racer on the 360, but a solid one, and a long, you know, respected series.
3485803	3490405	It sort of makes sense that Namco is going full circle with Ridge Racer 7 being a launch title for the PS3.
3491266	3492327	Ridge Racer Vision 2010
3520880	3521601	So check that out.
3521821	3523222	That'll be just a couple weeks.
3523522	3524923	We're like, what, two weeks away from E3?
3524943	3531689	By the way, if you do own Ridge Racer 6 for the 360, I swear to God, you gotta constantly watch that marketplace.
3532049	3533810	There was more cars to download.
3534271	3537854	They literally have over like 60 downloads for Ridge Racer 6.
3538894	3540055	And most of them are free.
3540396	3541456	All of the cars are free.
3541556	3544038	I've downloaded like 30-some cars for this thing.
3544539	3545500	I mean, it's excellent.
3545540	3547321	You really need to check it out if you haven't yet.
3547788	3550789	and by God, by now, it should be used for pretty cheap.
3550869	3552970	I mean, it was one of the launch titles that no one liked.
3553510	3554370	It's definitely worth it.
3554411	3556211	Wait a minute, you're saying no one liked it?
3557152	3560193	Okay, it was at the very bottom of the list as far as popularity goes.
3560253	3563714	I thought Amp 3 was the least selling title.
3563754	3567015	No, no, Amp 3, I think, didn't even... It was number one in Japan.
3567035	3572037	It was the number one launch title in Japan, but in the United States, it just bombed, which I don't understand.
3572057	3572877	It didn't look bad.
3572917	3576039	It wasn't like, you know... I thought it was a pretty good game.
3576319	3577119	It's fine, it's fine.
3578520	3580302	It's a solid game, let's put it that way.
3580662	3582784	Alright, speaking about E3 coming up in a couple weeks.
3582864	3584386	Loki, news is starting to get out.
3584466	3585366	Who's showing what?
3585587	3587889	Huge emails went out to the attendees this week, right?
3588229	3589210	Yes, of course.
3589490	3595996	They have the big, you know, kind of like showing, basically advertising some of the new properties that we're going to see there this year.
3597457	3598999	Some basic ones I've got to mention.
3599119	3603543	Elvion, which is one of the 360 games that looked really sweet using the Unreal 3 engine.
3603991	3605033	Desperate Housewives Diet Queen
3620034	3621655	One of those educational games, I guess.
3621675	3622235	Okay.
3622575	3623975	Or die trying.
3623995	3625156	This one's interesting, though.
3625616	3630778	They're actually creating Video Game Tycoon, where you get to be a video game design company.
3630838	3632338	So that one's kind of neat.
3632438	3632899	That's cute.
3633439	3635019	Some other things, Bomberman X-Zero.
3635199	3635619	Oh, wait.
3636060	3636880	We talked about that before.
3636900	3638060	Oh, gee, where did I hear that one already?
3638080	3639001	And Rengoku 2.
3639061	3640201	Yeah, we talked about that, too.
3640221	3641141	Funny.
3641301	3645283	Silent Hill fans will be interested to know that there's going to be a mobile version coming to cell phones.
3645563	3646703	Same with Hellboy.
3646823	3648424	No, they won't, because cell phone games suck.
3650602	3653844	We'll tell that to the people that own the N-Gage.
3654104	3656325	Okay, N-Gage owners, cell phone games suck.
3656365	3657986	Get a real system.
3658506	3663588	Super Pac-Man is being released by Namco, which no surprise there.
3664028	3669211	Of course, they're also working on Dragon Spirit, which should be interesting, and Snoopy and the Red Baron.
3669491	3670151	I guess that's kind of neat.
3672557	3677641	The only decent cell phone game I've ever played is Sudoku, and that's because it's Sudoku, it's hard to fuck that up.
3677661	3680103	This one sounded kind of interesting when I read the little thing on it.
3680583	3689690	R2 Beat, being developed by this company called Seed9 Entertainment, and it's going to combine, it's an online rhythm action racing game.
3690871	3700719	So, I guess it's basically kind of combining both music beat and extreme speed.
3700779	3701560	So it sounds like if
3702642	3707043	I don't know, Amplitude or whatever was a racing game?
3707443	3709104	I don't know, it might be kind of neat.
3709164	3722267	King of Fighters 2006 coming from SNK and a whole bunch of Metal Slug crap including the Metal Slug collection which I thought they were all the same anyways but yeah, that's basically it.
3722547	3724247	Alright, things to look forward to at E3.
3724767	3728648	Expect a full report on the Diet Revolution?
3728668	3729608	What was that called?
3729708	3730248	Diet Girl.
3731149	3732269	Oh, can't wait to play that.
3733786	3737727	Yes, that can be maybe my subtitle on the show in the future.
3740227	3745768	If you'd rather not hear about new stuff, but you're still living in the retro gaming phase, then you'll be happy to know.
3746108	3756351	Or if you bought Oblivion for the 360 and just loved it, and you want to know a little more about the series history, head on over to TheElderScrolls.com, because you know what?
3756391	3758711	The original Elder Scrolls arena game
3759465	3759966	Star Siege Tribes
3779531	3780011	Exactly.
3780492	3781773	Alright, Loki.
3782233	3790080	Now, if you don't like your gaming free, but you like to spend a little more money, you might be able to buy a super special upgrade coming to the 360 soon, right?
3790320	3790900	Yeah.
3791101	3793082	Like a $100 HD DVD drive.
3793402	3794684	That'll be external.
3795084	3795704	Costs about $100.
3795824	3797706	Supposed to be shown at E3.
3799928	3800348	Why?
3801689	3806113	This is interesting to me because didn't HD DVD players just come out for $1,000?
3806153	3806473	Yes.
3808908	3810149	And now they're saying it's only going to be $100.
3810549	3812151	That was Blu-ray, I thought.
3812231	3815373	But yeah, I don't understand why they're releasing this.
3815693	3820317	For one, I don't understand why they're releasing it as an external drive because that would look ugly as hell on a 360.
3821097	3834128	And I don't think it has the bandwidth through USB to do it, so I don't know how they're planning on pulling it across unless it's going to kind of slap on top maybe where the hard drive goes or something to run it SATA or something.
3835228	3835529	I don't know.
3835609	3835749	But...
3836784	3844386	Also kind of related in the same article, they're talking about 100GB hard drive is supposed to be shown at E3 as well.
3845026	3846046	No price and date available.
3846106	3852908	And also the premium pack will be dropped $100 to $299 retail in October.
3853368	3857169	And the core system will be $80 less, which is the other story.
3857389	3862090	I can see that happening because they've got to compete with the PS3 when it comes out.
3865916	3871318	I don't know about... I don't believe the $100 mark for the system.
3871778	3872698	$100 seems really, really low.
3872718	3878099	I would have to see... We'd have to see about that, because that's kind of... I don't know.
3878539	3883621	That's going to really screw all those other HD DVD standalone players, but then again, maybe that's Microsoft once.
3883681	3888582	Maybe they're willing to take a hit on it so people will get that gaming system, and as you say, the Trojan horse in their living room.
3888722	3892603	I've not really heard you say that before, but I really like that, because it's true.
3893323	3893463	Yeah.
3894651	3898834	Another Xbox story sure to piss off people that bought their Xboxes launch week.
3899355	3902878	Yeah, well, this isn't really... They shouldn't be too pissed off about it.
3903018	3905620	The CPU is getting upgraded.
3905680	3908282	Basically, all they're doing is they're making the same CPU.
3908602	3911505	It's a bit smaller, so it's going to take less power, less heat.
3912085	3912686	That's about it.
3913186	3916649	Although, they're really having many issues with the CPU overheating.
3916809	3917810	That was never the problem.
3917930	3919351	It was the GPU overheating.
3919591	3920332	Oh, really?
3920352	3920432	Yeah.
3921849	3924691	I was just going to say, trust me, those Xbox 360s had problems.
3924931	3929014	If you don't believe me, go back and listen to the show when I bought my Xbox 360 that same week.
3929034	3929815	I was a little unhappy.
3929955	3934098	All you have to know is it's not going to make your Xbox 360 any faster.
3934158	3938722	So if you bought it launch day, whatever, and it's still working, not to worry.
3939942	3944045	And it's not really expected it's going to cause any compatibility issues.
3944105	3948249	But then again, I've seen them screw up smaller things.
3949109	3950090	Although hopeful models...
3950603	3959714	hopeful modders might find a way to overclock it with that more thermally efficient CPU.
3961016	3962237	You think they haven't done it yet?
3962377	3962738	They might.
3963138	3963659	I don't think so.
3965123	3965683	We shall see.
3985334	3997782	is powered by a pair of ARM processors, has an open source API and development tools, and can run thousands of classic console video games, online retailer Dynamism says.
3997903	3998863	I think that's it, Dynamism.
3999804	4002686	The GP2X was originally known as the GPX2.
4003346	4008990	It's got 64 megs of RAM, Flash, expandable via an SD card slot,
4009770	4018734	3.5 inch QVGA LCD monitor that supports 170,000 colors, 4-way controller and a small thumb joystick on the left, I.O.
4018774	4023135	ports include stereo headphone jack, USB 2.0, and TV out.
4023595	4026497	And of course, people are loading that crap up with emulators.
4026957	4027757	Kind of interesting.
4028737	4030738	Would anything like this ever make it big?
4031759	4032499	No, why not?
4033659	4035440	I mean, this sounds great!
4036764	4040447	It's a total geek thing, but hey, it plays thousands of games.
4041488	4043350	It plays thousands of games.
4044091	4044551	It's great.
4046013	4048055	But where's the challenge of putting Linux on that?
4048095	4051838	I mean, get this, $170 to $200 for this thing.
4052939	4053600	Is that not cheaper?
4053720	4055241	Isn't the PSP $199 still?
4055682	4056142	I can't remember.
4056162	4056843	$199 to $149?
4056923	4058084	Yeah, it's about that.
4058104	4059705	This thing is as much as a PSP.
4060906	4062588	And it's just made for developing.
4064264	4067186	GK128 says you can put a different Linux distro on.
4067206	4067746	That's the challenge.
4094238	4094939	He's got a point.
4122273	4124175	is basically sick of Duke Nukem Forever.
4124215	4130980	And he's, you know, from 3D Realms, basically saying, you know, it's taken so long to actually develop the game.
4132101	4136684	Just right now, you know, the problem is when they show it off, you know, people are going to be like, eh, whatever.
4137025	4138226	But they just want to finish it.
4138326	4144450	They want to get it done, get it out there, and try to recover some of that many, many dollars spent on developing it.
4144470	4147713	So they can work on the sequel that apparently they were talking about working on.
4148280	4150881	I can't believe they're talking about a sequel for Duke Nukem Forever.
4150961	4152182	I mean... It's called Duke Nukem.
4152262	4152802	No, really.
4153642	4156863	No, really, what they should do is change the name of Duke Nukem Forever.
4157424	4158364	Change it to something else.
4158724	4163126	Yeah, Duke Nukem Forever isn't coming out, but... It's, uh... Duke Nukem 3.
4163886	4166007	Luke Socketum Forever.
4168008	4176631	I mean, honestly, I think what they should do is they should develop the game and just release all the partial games that they had, like the one on the Quake 2 engine, the one on the Unreal engine...
4178169	4180132	Just scrap the name and call it Duke Nukem 4.
4180453	4181174	That's all you gotta do.
4182195	4182596	I don't know.
4182616	4182917	We'll see.
4184798	4189462	Do you want to be the first person in the world to play the Nintendo Revolution?
4190202	4192063	I bet you do, you little fanboys and girls.
4192824	4193684	Well, here's the deal.
4193704	4197547	Nintendo and AOL.com are teaming up, and they're going to be having a contest.
4197887	4208094	One lucky Nintendo fan gets to go to Los Angeles, touch and play with the Revolution before the conference, and then present the machine to the world a few hours later at the Nintendo Conference.
4208114	4209995	By the way, you're going to the Nintendo Conference, aren't you, Loki?
4210396	4210776	Maybe.
4210856	4211656	I hate you.
4211917	4212557	I hate you.
4212837	4213858	How did you get in?
4214898	4215739	I've got connections.
4216039	4217080	Oh, you little bitch.
4217180	4217800	I'm not going.
4217920	4222223	DarkSakura's not going, but Loki is going to Nintendo Conference and we'll let you know firsthand what happens.
4222403	4226185	But you're not going to be the second person in the world to play the thing either, right?
4226386	4227326	I'll beat people up.
4227506	4233290	Well, they're going to be having the black eyed peas there to distract people so I can play the console, so...
4233618	4233878	All right.
4233938	4236059	But I'm going to definitely get to play before E3.
4236319	4236999	Here's the funny thing.
4237259	4246522	Three finalists are going to be chosen by entries that are given on AOL's website, but only one person is going to be selected once they're all out there to actually do it.
4246822	4248562	Wouldn't that suck to be one of the other two?
4249142	4250923	But they all get to go to E3 anyway, huh?
4250943	4251263	Who cares?
4251303	4252383	They get to go.
4252823	4253223	So what?
4253283	4254424	I was the first to play in the world.
4254784	4255184	Whatever.
4255204	4256544	I mean, it's no big deal.
4256584	4257284	Yeah, get out of my way.
4257324	4257745	I want to play.
4257825	4258365	I was the first.
4259885	4270609	I guess I wasn't really the first non-Kanami employee to play Supernova in the United States, so that was kind of cool.
4270809	4272790	It's just like Final Fantasy XI this week.
4272930	4274971	I was the first person to get Corsair!
4275531	4277632	Well, I was the first person to get laid tonight.
4278672	4280253	Is there any quests involved with that?
4280273	4282434	Yeah, there's big quests and the whole thing.
4283034	4284614	So is everybody Puppet Master now?
4284634	4285875	Everybody just has to be first.
4286613	4287594	Everybody just wants to be first.
4287614	4293196	It's like, I'm looking for a white mage, but all we have is blue mage and Corsair and Puppet Master.
4295938	4297659	I wish I had time for that game.
4297679	4300380	I'm sorry, it's just the 360 thing just could have been better.
4302621	4308524	So anyway, if you want to enter AOL, I think you have to be on AOL to do it, so I hope you're there.
4309625	4315388	Anyway, but Rob, how will I ever find a CD to sign up for AOL?
4318393	4319754	I don't know, maybe go to AOL.com?
4320214	4320734	Oh, maybe.
4321795	4323475	Loki, do you have any other release dates for us?
4323535	4327037	I slotted some time to talk about release dates, but I don't know if you have your list or whatever.
4327057	4328137	What's coming up this week?
4328158	4330218	Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories moved dates.
4330278	4334000	It moved to June 6th, and they dropped the price again to $19.99 retail.
4334160	4335441	Oh, I'm being corrected by our chat room.
4335481	4336661	It's not AOL only.
4336721	4339143	It is open to non-AOL members as well.
4339963	4341304	GK128 said it first.
4341444	4341904	Thank you, guys.
4342064	4344305	I should go sign up for that and see if I can win it.
4345339	4346980	I know, maybe I should go sign up too.
4347000	4348181	I don't want to get AOL crap.
4349122	4350182	Well, then again, I already get it.
4350242	4351503	How much, how worse could it be?
4351743	4355165	Because I had AOL for two weeks because I bought it for a trip.
4355185	4358267	Just don't, I don't want to, I feel dirty.
4358708	4359868	You don't leave AOL.
4360669	4361389	I know, I know.
4362090	4362290	Ever.
4363371	4370836	No, but next week, or actually I should say this week, great stuff coming out, finally, finally,
4371741	4375305	Finally, Advent Children is finally coming out.
4375345	4376367	Is it finally here?
4376387	4376847	Finally.
4376867	4379710	They're advertising it on TV, so you can go pick it up.
4379931	4384296	You might even be able to find it in stores now if you're listening to the podcast because people like Breaking Street Date.
4384917	4390423	But definitely go check it out if you haven't seen it yet, although you probably have on the internet.
4390483	4392005	But now's your chance to get it.
4392904	4394205	Nice English copy of it.
4394905	4395965	Go check it out now.
4396826	4401668	Also, coming out this week, I have Outrun 2006 Coast to Coast, which is going to be pretty fun.
4402668	4413573	Also, Rampage Total Destruction coming out, which isn't really any different than the last few Rampage games.
4415374	4418495	And then, Windback 2, Project Poseidon is coming out.
4419229	4421090	not too much buzz on that but that's still good.
4421110	4422870	Ace Combat Zero, The Balkan War.
4423751	4426652	If you're a flight sim fan you're going to love that.
4428292	4431333	I believe that was all the big stuff.
4431773	4435055	I was really looking for Grand Theft Auto but they had to move it.
4435435	4441017	Hopefully they're either working on multiplayer or fixing multiplayer because their multiplayer sucked.
4441937	4443337	God damn lazy programmers.
4444418	4446639	It's no wonder that is what's going to take 2 down.
4449366	4449546	Delphi
4473746	4474607	Maybe not, CompuServe.
4475107	4475687	Minespring?
4476067	4476288	Maybe.
4476988	4481891	If you go all the way back to Commodore 64, there was one, it was before AOL, because AOL bought them out.
4481951	4483072	Quark, I want to say it was called?
4483092	4483472	Yeah, Quark.
4483592	4487815	I used to freaking go on a bulletin board, which had internet access.
4487855	4488915	BBSs were hardcore.
4488975	4492397	I used to do BBSs in Sacramento area, like hardcore locally.
4492417	4500082	Grab the California Computer News, a little free publication that was out there, have the BBS list in the back, and you can find a bunch of stuff on there.
4500282	4508985	Remember back in the day, those you guys used to call into BBS, it's probably if you're more like our age, like in your 20s, although I imagine there's some teens that remember this too.
4510285	4519748	It wasn't about the size of your internet penis, but it was about how much of the SysOps ass you kissed to get access points.
4519808	4528451	It was for more time with door games, so you could play Legend of the Red Dragon and The Pit and Trade Wars 2002 and all those games.
4530151	4546821	It was all about downloading registered shareware programs, 2400 BPS, or you know, 56K BPS, and also, and basically, you know, using that wonderful Z-Batch protocol to download everything in your, you know, telnet.
4547002	4547082	56K?
4547222	4547782	Are you kidding?
4547802	4547902	9600 baud?
4551554	4554175	I want an Orange Lounge Radio BBS.
4554755	4555475	That's what I want.
4556015	4556676	Can we have that?
4557296	4558196	Can we make that happen?
4558236	4560076	Can't you do it through Telnet now or something?
4561317	4562717	I'm going to talk to our webmaster.
4563177	4565017	Why would we want a BBS?
4565057	4566938	Because it's a BBS.
4566998	4571939	You can play Legend of the Red Dragon in the pit.
4573157	4574398	We have the technology.
4574719	4576401	Yes, we have the technology.
4576421	4577302	We can build it.
4577462	4581366	My mother would never let me get a second phone line to run a BBS when I was a kid.
4581386	4581806	I want one now.
4581826	4584589	Can't we just do something on the website that'll look like a BBS?
4584730	4585891	No, I want a BBS.
4586431	4587993	I want message boards and everything.
4588073	4589595	Let's just make a mod and call it a day.
4591792	4593853	Fuck a mud, I want to be BS.
4594173	4597714	I played muds for like two weeks, and then I was like, oh my god.
4597894	4598314	Two weeks?
4598354	4600094	Oh my god, you're like uber hardcore.
4600214	4604655	I know, I was like, after two weeks, I was like, this is the nerdiest I've ever been in my entire life.
4606636	4607736	And that's saying quite a bit.
4608596	4610077	That makes me feel nerdier than usual.
4610757	4611037	Alright.
4612094	4615498	Anyway, we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this little break.
4615998	4621164	Kid Whatever, one of the artists from In The Groove, is going to be with us in Part B, so definitely, definitely stay tuned.
4621744	4626710	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
4627170	4631495	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
