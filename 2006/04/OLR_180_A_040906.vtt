00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Today, April 9th, 2006, new screenshots from the revolution hit the internet, Xbox Live

00:20.000 --> 00:24.920
prepares for lots of new arcade games, and which Japanese company might be finding itself

00:24.920 --> 00:31.920
in big trouble this tax season.

00:32.600 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there in the podcast universe or the live streaming radio

00:37.000 --> 00:39.280
universe you are listening to

00:39.280 --> 00:43.120
Orange Lounge Radio episode number one hundred and eighty

00:43.120 --> 00:46.880
for April the ninth two thousand six. How you guys doing out there? My name is Rob Roberts

00:46.880 --> 00:48.320
you might know me as Sky.

00:48.320 --> 00:53.300
Not with us tonight is Dark Sakura also known as Jamie Summers. She's sick. She

00:53.300 --> 00:57.160
She has Asian bird flu, I think.

00:57.160 --> 01:00.280
She has a really high fever or something, so she had to call in tonight.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.420
So we hope you feel better soon, DarkSakura, if you're out there listening.

01:03.420 --> 01:08.580
Secretly though, I think she's just like, you know how when a really popular video game

01:08.580 --> 01:12.580
would come out, you'd stay at home, call in sick and play hooky to play that game?

01:12.580 --> 01:14.500
I think Kingdom Hearts 2 did that to her.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.980
I think she called in sick to stay home and play Kingdom Hearts 2.

01:16.980 --> 01:18.980
No, of course I'm teasing.

01:18.980 --> 01:20.220
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:20.220 --> 01:24.120
You know, what's funny is I feel like I'm actually Jamie right now because

01:25.020 --> 01:27.580
Because you're sitting in a chair with a laptop

01:28.260 --> 01:33.420
Yeah, I know cuz you got your new laptop, didn't you? Yeah, so this is weird and you did not buy a Mac

01:33.420 --> 01:40.660
I did not buy a Mac despite the advice of our listeners. I don't like honestly you got to compare the specs and

01:41.040 --> 01:44.020
Then you see clearly that you know the way to go

01:44.660 --> 01:47.440
Is the way I did. Well, I'm not a fan of Gateway. How's that feel?

01:47.440 --> 01:53.340
I'm not a fan of gateway either to be honest, but you know what this computer is at the right price and have the right specs

01:53.880 --> 01:58.320
To me gateway is merely the case. It's in so all right, whatever all right

01:58.600 --> 02:01.880
Well say helping us out tonight since we're one person short

02:01.880 --> 02:06.640
So we had to call on someone at the last minute and always prepared to lend a hand say hello to spike

02:08.040 --> 02:12.280
Hello, how you doing? I'm doing very good good good to hear it

02:12.280 --> 02:17.560
Alright, he's feeling a little pressure a little bit because we literally asked him

02:17.560 --> 02:21.520
about oh an hour ago, hey can you sit in and be a host tonight on a radio program on the

02:21.520 --> 02:22.520
internet?

02:22.520 --> 02:23.920
But you've done this before, you've been here before.

02:23.920 --> 02:24.920
It's always good times.

02:24.920 --> 02:28.520
Alright, yeah you know a lot about games, I know you don't really lead it on very much,

02:28.520 --> 02:30.000
you know a lot about games, you really do.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.040
What was that Japanese game you're saying you're going to bring me next week that was

02:33.040 --> 02:34.720
some PS2 launch title?

02:34.720 --> 02:35.720
Primal Image.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.280
Okay, let me set up the story a little bit.

02:37.280 --> 02:41.720
We were at Walmart last night for some ungodly, I hate Walmart, I don't know why I was there,

02:41.720 --> 02:48.280
But we were at Walmart last night, and I was talking about, oh, Rumble Roses XX, because

02:48.280 --> 02:51.840
we saw it there, and I said pretty much the only reason that you would want to get Rumble

02:51.840 --> 02:57.720
Roses XX is for the photo-taking mode of where you can take dirty pictures of all the wrestlers.

02:57.720 --> 03:01.880
It's like, you know, I don't know, it's the best feature of the game, because the game

03:01.880 --> 03:04.600
itself is very slow and boring.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.360
But you said it reminded you of this game, my description.

03:07.360 --> 03:15.580
It's basically Pokemon Snap with half-naked virtual models, and they go around doing their

03:15.580 --> 03:21.660
various poses as you circle around them, taking photos, and you get bonus points for the sort

03:21.660 --> 03:24.780
of more suggestive photos you take.

03:24.780 --> 03:25.780
Very fun.

03:25.780 --> 03:27.980
But they did not release this game in the US?

03:27.980 --> 03:28.980
Sadly, no.

03:28.980 --> 03:29.980
Gee, I wonder why.

03:29.980 --> 03:30.980
Alright.

03:30.980 --> 03:35.220
Well, maybe, I'll be, hopefully Spike will bring a copy of that for me next week so I

03:35.220 --> 03:38.180
take a look at it cuz I really want to play that game and check out cuz I love

03:38.180 --> 03:41.420
Pokemon snap so I don't see why I wouldn't love this game I mean Pokemon

03:41.420 --> 03:45.180
snap was one of the reasons to own a 64 like like those like the greatest games

03:45.180 --> 03:51.060
you have Mario 64 Mario Kart 64 and then Pokemon snap is where it's at I

03:51.060 --> 03:55.780
don't care what you haters say and mischief makers I know I never played

03:55.780 --> 03:59.660
that what is that oh you've got drop jaw what is mischief makers I've never heard

03:59.660 --> 04:04.420
of this I've heard of mischief makers it's not as bad as it sounds what is it

04:04.420 --> 04:07.420
Tell me, what is this game? What are you doing it?

04:07.420 --> 04:10.420
If I remember correctly, it's based off an anime, I want to say.

04:10.420 --> 04:14.420
No, don't look like that. It's not like that. It's a good game.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.420
It's not a... It's an anime game.

04:17.420 --> 04:18.420
Alright.

04:18.420 --> 04:24.420
Alright, we're going to go around and start this show off as we usually do with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week,

04:24.420 --> 04:29.420
where we go around and check in and see what we've been playing this week and what we like and what we hate.

04:29.420 --> 04:31.420
Loki, what have you been playing this week?

04:31.420 --> 04:37.780
I've been playing Far Cry Instincts Predator, and that game's pretty, I don't know, long.

04:37.780 --> 04:43.860
It's a fun game, you know, but then again, it's one of those games, like achievement-wise,

04:43.860 --> 04:46.900
if you're going for achievement points in this game, might as well spend your time elsewhere

04:46.900 --> 04:55.580
because to beat the game, you get 10 points, and you have to beat it in every single difficulty

04:55.580 --> 05:00.660
through both the Instinct storyline and the Evolution storyline, and then do a bunch of

05:00.660 --> 05:06.000
shit where some of those xbox live arcade games are like you press the L trigger you

05:06.000 --> 05:11.280
get 20 points that would be hilarious to have like a game with a thousand achievements in

05:11.280 --> 05:16.840
each one's a point you know like pushing direction up pushing direction down that would be hilarious

05:16.840 --> 05:21.840
but no unfortunately can you imagine if DDR comes out for the xbox 360 what the achievement

05:21.840 --> 05:26.760
points for that are gonna be like that's gonna be cake it's gonna be serious cake but um

05:26.760 --> 05:32.160
You played with a mat instead of a controller. You get 500 points.

05:32.160 --> 05:36.200
Oh my gods, you beat Max Limited!

05:36.200 --> 05:37.760
Go outside!

05:37.760 --> 05:39.040
Now, um...

05:39.040 --> 05:41.080
I don't know, so that game's kind of fun.

05:41.080 --> 05:45.640
I did get Rumble Roses XX. I did not buy Rumble Roses XX, just to make that clear.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.360
I would not spend money on that game, unfortunately, but

05:48.360 --> 05:53.240
I did get it. I haven't played it, though, yet, because I, you know, got a laptop and

05:53.240 --> 05:56.400
haven't had a chance to waste time on it in that game.

05:56.400 --> 06:04.100
it looked interesting, I guess. Right now I've gotten pretty much every game for March

06:04.100 --> 06:09.920
except for Blazing Angels, and that's the only one I don't have yet. But I'm not really

06:09.920 --> 06:15.100
going to be buying games until June now, because I don't like Tomb Raider. I don't really care

06:15.100 --> 06:21.000
for Top Spin. Battlefield 2, I've never played it, don't really care. And the stuff in May,

06:21.000 --> 06:30.320
X-Men 3, maybe Time Shift, and MotoGP 2006 moved, and Rockstar's Table Tennis, no thank

06:30.320 --> 06:31.320
you.

06:31.320 --> 06:34.840
I don't know, I have to admit, my interest has somewhat peaked at Rockstar Table Tennis,

06:34.840 --> 06:35.840
I must say.

06:35.840 --> 06:39.320
I've been playing, of course, more Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City Stories.

06:39.320 --> 06:40.320
It's just fun.

06:40.320 --> 06:44.000
I've been six months, I mean, now it doesn't get old.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
It's just really fun.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.120
The multiplayer is the best part, and I hope the god that it has the multiplayer when it

06:48.120 --> 06:54.120
it comes out on the PlayStation 2 version. Instincts tell me, though, no. It's not gonna.

06:54.120 --> 07:00.120
All right. Anything else? That's it. All right. Spike, my friend, what have you been playing

07:00.120 --> 07:06.920
this week? I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 12 or 11. Oh my god. You're just,

07:06.920 --> 07:12.400
you're too eager for the 12, aren't you? I am. I want to play it so badly, which is a

07:12.400 --> 07:16.460
marked change from how I felt initially, but now all my time with 11 has me really excited

07:16.460 --> 07:19.460
about that same base gameplay, but with a story!

07:19.460 --> 07:23.960
See? That's what I'm telling people! To really appreciate the Final Fantasy XII demo, you

07:23.960 --> 07:28.600
must have had some exposure to XI. Yeah, it's true. I definitely agree with you now. I'm

07:28.600 --> 07:35.020
also replaying Kingdom Hearts, the first game, to get ready for the second one, and... Is

07:35.020 --> 07:38.800
this because you're poor and you'll have to wait until it's a $20 game? That's almost

07:38.800 --> 07:45.400
exactly what I... I'm just giving you a hard time. But yeah, I put in 17 hours over that

07:45.400 --> 07:54.160
last week. Dang! And I forgot how much I hated the camera, but I really like everything else

07:54.160 --> 07:59.100
about the game. That perfectly sums up my review of Kingdom Hearts, the first one. Hate

07:59.100 --> 08:04.700
the camera, love everything else. So yeah, that's my week in gaming. Awesome. Let's see

08:04.700 --> 08:09.600
what I've been playing this week. I just picked up Top Spin 2, the tennis game on the Xbox

08:09.600 --> 08:15.080
360, which was the only Xbox 360 game I played at last year's E3, so I think it has somewhat

08:15.080 --> 08:19.000
sentimental value to me, because it was the only game that had no lines last year at E3.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.920
I think, no, I actually played it, instead of playing it at the Microsoft booth, I played

08:22.920 --> 08:27.380
it at 2K Games' booth, and there wasn't nearly as many people there, because they were kind

08:27.380 --> 08:28.560
of in a different spot.

08:28.560 --> 08:33.000
So I got to play Top Spin 2, and I don't think I've played this game thoroughly enough to

08:33.000 --> 08:35.040
give it a good review yet.

08:35.040 --> 08:41.120
I did notice, like, my first impressions were character creation, whoa, like, okay, it's

08:41.120 --> 08:42.680
right up there with Oblivion, okay?

08:42.680 --> 08:47.820
You know how Oblivion will let you totally customize everything?

08:47.820 --> 08:51.600
The only thing that Topspin 2 is missing is Night Elves, okay?

08:51.600 --> 08:54.940
Otherwise, it's just his throw, and that would be pretty badass if he could be a Night

08:54.940 --> 08:56.680
Elf tennis player, I must say.

08:56.680 --> 09:00.440
Now, I saw something with Oblivion, someone made Chuck Norris.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.160
Oh, I read about that on the internet.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.920
Young Chuck Norris thing, it's hilarious.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.920
What exactly did they do with that?

09:06.920 --> 09:10.720
There was a skit that they did on Saturday Night Live, Young Chuck Norris, and the whole

09:10.720 --> 09:16.720
song that goes along with that and he kicked and he punched and it's really funny, you

09:16.720 --> 09:23.480
gotta check it out, I think it's on YouTube and they really, just using the normal character

09:23.480 --> 09:27.240
creation, they made it really look like Chuck Norris and it was hilarious because he was

09:27.240 --> 09:31.440
beating up the shop owner and it went through basically everything that was on the Saturday

09:31.440 --> 09:35.560
Night Live music video, they just kind of recreated it in oblivion and it was pretty

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
funny.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.560
Awesome.

09:37.560 --> 09:41.560
Besides the character creation, then I started doing career mode a little bit, but I found

09:41.560 --> 09:44.600
that I kind of sucked at the game because I didn't know what I was doing.

09:44.600 --> 09:48.980
I didn't think the game had a very friendly tutorial mode or anything.

09:48.980 --> 09:54.640
There was really nothing to tell me, press A to do a light bounce, press X to do a slice

09:54.640 --> 09:56.280
and all that stuff.

09:56.280 --> 10:01.500
I would like a tennis game that's built for the retarded tennis player like myself who

10:01.500 --> 10:08.660
who is too fat to play real tennis, who might be able to benefit from knowing what a slice

10:08.660 --> 10:11.580
really is, assuming maybe I haven't played tennis before.

10:11.580 --> 10:16.020
I know what it is, but I would have liked something that really started me from an amateur

10:16.020 --> 10:20.360
level, whereas the game threw me right in there and expected me to know stuff.

10:20.360 --> 10:24.380
Even in the first training, it's like, okay, you've got to serve ten balls, and you're

10:24.380 --> 10:26.080
like, okay, what the hell am I doing?

10:26.080 --> 10:30.100
It didn't really explain it for me, so I actually had to open the instruction manual and read

10:30.100 --> 10:31.100
it.

10:31.100 --> 10:36.700
to do that with games. Extraction manuals are dated things. I don't ever read instruction

10:36.700 --> 10:41.300
manuals with games, ever. I don't need them, usually, but I needed it for this. That made

10:41.300 --> 10:46.980
me a little sad. But the graphics are really pretty, and I played a tournament in a Japanese

10:46.980 --> 10:52.140
cup or something, and it was all decorated, very Japanese style, totally stereotypical,

10:52.140 --> 10:58.880
but it was cool. Besides that, I've been playing Holdovers from last week, Beatmania, Kingdom

10:58.880 --> 11:03.960
Hearts 2, and I downloaded Feeding Frenzy, which is an Xbox Live Arcade title, which

11:03.960 --> 11:07.760
I guess came out a couple weeks ago, because I wanted a new arcade game, and Street Fighter

11:07.760 --> 11:10.200
2 is still not available.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.200
What the hell's with that?

11:11.200 --> 11:12.200
I don't know.

11:12.200 --> 11:17.400
Well, they had major lag problems that they had to fix.

11:17.400 --> 11:21.680
A friend of a friend mentioned that there's major lag issues going on, and that's, I don't

11:21.680 --> 11:26.240
think, supposed to be very well known, but there were lag problems to the extreme, so.

11:26.240 --> 11:30.240
So it's supposed to be coming out, I think, at the end of this month.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.240
That's what they say.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.240
I think we have a story on it later.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.240
Then again, they said that last month too.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.240
That's very true.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.520
So I don't trust them until the damn thing's on the marketplace.

11:37.520 --> 11:40.720
So I downloaded Feeding Frenzy instead because I remember this game because I've played a

11:40.720 --> 11:44.360
game at Dave and Buster's that's just like it, except it gives you tickets when you do

11:44.360 --> 11:45.400
really well.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.520
And to be honest, I think I prefer this game when it gives you tickets.

11:48.520 --> 11:52.960
Because this game was kind of junky, like it's really boring and you do the same thing

11:52.960 --> 11:53.960
over and over.

11:53.960 --> 11:59.120
sat there for like two hours just to play this game until I died I beat the

11:59.120 --> 12:03.160
game the very first time I ever played it and got something like 75 achievement

12:03.160 --> 12:08.400
points for doing so like it was it was cake and I think it's because geometry

12:08.400 --> 12:12.440
wars I and I really suck at geometry wars but it has me skilled enough to

12:12.440 --> 12:15.760
dodge things really well using the analog stick like using my sprite to

12:15.760 --> 12:19.640
dodge things and that's pretty much all feeding frenzy is is a poor man's

12:19.640 --> 12:24.720
Geometry Wars with no shooter so no it's just I here's the thing I don't like

12:24.720 --> 12:29.400
about these some of these trackball because that game is way better with the

12:29.400 --> 12:33.360
trackball than it is a controller I didn't mind the controller because I am

12:33.360 --> 12:37.520
the game's okay I do like the fact that saves your progress so because the game

12:37.520 --> 12:40.280
is kind of crappy I wouldn't want to have to go back and replay the whole

12:40.280 --> 12:47.560
game the thing though I don't like about it is it all these web games are getting

12:47.560 --> 12:52.780
You know poured over there just flash games. Yep, and let me take a moment to introduce the chat room over at

12:53.540 --> 13:00.540
www.orangelaundrydo.com click on chat. We do tape live every Sunday night to provide linear listener interaction

13:00.540 --> 13:03.720
We're one of the few podcasts that allow this. It's awesome. We love doing this

13:04.220 --> 13:10.760
And you guys get your input gk 128 says in the chat room feeding frenzy free on the PC

13:11.300 --> 13:16.900
$10 on Xbox Live Arcade and you know what you're absolutely right. I'm a consumer whore. There's absolutely no

13:16.900 --> 13:22.180
No reason I should have paid for this except for the fact that as opposed to sitting in

13:22.180 --> 13:26.060
my little office chair and playing on the PC little screen, I like being able to plop

13:26.060 --> 13:32.220
my butt on the couch, have my cup of tea or whatever I'm drinking that night, and play

13:32.220 --> 13:34.060
on the HDTV.

13:34.060 --> 13:35.500
There's something to be said about that.

13:35.500 --> 13:39.140
That's why I plan to get Final Fantasy XI in a couple weeks, which makes absolutely

13:39.140 --> 13:43.660
no sense because I already have it on the PC, but I'm just that lazy where I want to

13:43.660 --> 13:47.780
plop on the couch and not have to move or anything and lay down and you know

13:47.780 --> 13:54.620
all that stuff just make sure you buy USB mouse and keyboard because well X

13:54.620 --> 13:58.220
defers upgrading so I think I'm gonna steal that one and use it as the Xbox

13:58.220 --> 14:03.220
thingy okay I'm just saying though make sure cuz yeah no there is no way in hell

14:03.220 --> 14:06.180
I would play and I would advise anybody out there it's gonna get into Final

14:06.180 --> 14:10.900
Fantasy 11 on Xbox 360 do yourself a favor buy a USB keyboard and a USB mouse

14:10.900 --> 14:13.580
because you will be a sad sad person otherwise

14:13.580 --> 14:16.500
actually you might be able to fake it without the mouse

14:16.500 --> 14:19.540
you could probably do it without the keyboard

14:19.540 --> 14:22.740
yeah the mouse because I remember I didn't really use the mouse at all

14:22.740 --> 14:26.260
during the game so keyboard's fine especially with all the shortcuts and

14:26.260 --> 14:27.460
everything so that's

14:27.460 --> 14:30.820
not a problem and honestly I already have a USB mouse that I use on my laptop

14:30.820 --> 14:33.940
and it's wireless so why not just take it and use it on the 360 that's what I plan on doing

14:33.940 --> 14:37.100
and the keyboard's good anyways because you can actually use it in other games like for

14:37.100 --> 14:39.460
example putting in cheat codes in Far Cry and Stinks

14:39.460 --> 14:43.340
it makes it a lot easier with the keyboard. There you go.

14:43.340 --> 14:47.280
Alright, let's see other comments in our chat room. VXJsonXV says

14:47.280 --> 14:49.300
Street Fighter 2 is now on GameTap.

14:49.300 --> 14:52.080
That's right, GameTap did a big update this week and I forgot that's another game I've

14:52.080 --> 14:52.880
been playing.

14:52.880 --> 14:55.400
Magic Sword is now on GameTap.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.240
Hello, like one of my favorite Capcom games ever.

14:58.240 --> 15:02.160
That's the greatest news I've heard all day. There you go. Hopefully I made

15:02.160 --> 15:03.820
someone else's week there.

15:03.820 --> 15:08.100
For GameTap's $10 a month thingy, you can do the Magic Sword.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.240
And I think they added a whole bunch of other Capcom stuff.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.940
Knights of the Round, I think, was on there too.

15:11.940 --> 15:13.660
Any word on Black Tiger?

15:14.820 --> 15:17.420
No, but VX JasonXV stays on top of that stuff

15:17.420 --> 15:19.860
more than I do, so he will probably be able to say.

15:19.860 --> 15:22.020
He did tell me King's Quest is on the way though.

15:22.020 --> 15:24.940
He saw in some movie thing on GameTap TV

15:24.940 --> 15:26.040
that King's Quest is coming,

15:26.040 --> 15:28.900
and to which I said something about, oh, it's about time.

15:29.940 --> 15:31.900
Let's see, other questions.

15:31.900 --> 15:35.460
I noticed our chat room is playing Mario Kart DS tonight,

15:35.460 --> 15:37.020
so if you're trying to find friends for DS

15:37.020 --> 15:42.700
you're listening live, go to orangehonoredradio.com and click on chat and you can find some folks

15:42.700 --> 15:44.300
to play Mario Kart DS with.

15:44.300 --> 15:49.660
I do see a lot of agreements for Mischief Makers, Hitstun in our chatroom says, Mischief

15:49.660 --> 15:55.340
Makers fucking owns, and I quote, so somebody knew what you were talking about, Spirit Snare

15:55.340 --> 15:57.420
agrees Mischief Makers was indeed awesome.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.400
That's because you guys have the best listeners.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.820
We do, we seriously do.

16:00.820 --> 16:05.020
I love our listeners, they're so awesome, we've got a full chatroom tonight, I demanded

16:05.020 --> 16:09.580
last week that more people visit our MySpace and it worked we've like doubled

16:09.580 --> 16:13.020
our numbers on MySpace and people are actually leaving us comments now it's

16:13.020 --> 16:16.900
awesome I love you guys for doing that if you want to visit myspace.com slash

16:16.900 --> 16:21.780
orange launch radio all one word so hurry before they take MySpace down

16:21.780 --> 16:27.140
because of all the you know controversial things that go on there

16:27.140 --> 16:31.980
like the scary old men that search out 17 year olds all right oh yeah VXJXV

16:31.980 --> 16:33.940
That's Xbox Live, isn't it?

16:33.940 --> 16:34.940
No.

16:34.940 --> 16:39.300
Remember the story from the, what was it, Philadelphia or Pittsburgh News that said

16:39.300 --> 16:43.020
the Nintendo DS is the new stalker system.

16:43.020 --> 16:46.100
Your little girl might go on PictoChat and get raped.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.460
I mean, seriously.

16:47.460 --> 16:49.100
What the hell was that?

16:49.100 --> 16:51.220
That news is like two months old.

16:51.220 --> 16:56.180
I would love to do that, just like, you know, do a little skit or something, like doing

16:56.180 --> 17:01.460
PictoChat and says, I'm going to rape you, and then have like a picture to go with it.

17:01.460 --> 17:08.940
Just save these ideas for OLR TV before you know who steals it.

17:08.940 --> 17:14.160
But wait, I was going to say, the videos, speaking of which, you updated OLR PSP.com

17:14.160 --> 17:15.160
with videos, right?

17:15.160 --> 17:16.160
Yeah, that was fun.

17:16.160 --> 17:20.180
Including something that we purposefully cut out of last week's show because it didn't

17:20.180 --> 17:25.020
make the podcast because I had the giggles a little too much going into one segment,

17:25.020 --> 17:27.220
but Dark Sakura had a lot to do with that.

17:27.220 --> 17:31.240
So you tape the whole thing and put a video of it on OLRPSP.com.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.240
That was fun.

17:32.240 --> 17:33.880
So, more videos to come in the future.

17:33.880 --> 17:39.760
Yeah, more videos to come in the future, we can't say too much yet, but yeah, and I'm

17:39.760 --> 17:44.520
trying to, well, the whole video thing was kind of an experiment because the PSP itself

17:44.520 --> 17:48.200
doesn't like downloading the videos, it thinks it's a webpage.

17:48.200 --> 17:52.000
It's kind of retarded when you think of it because you have to save the link as, so I

17:52.000 --> 17:56.160
got to put some different instructions on there and, you know, work at it that way,

17:56.160 --> 17:57.160
but...

17:57.160 --> 18:00.200
because we've got something big planned yeah that's all I have to say we got

18:00.200 --> 18:05.920
something big planned for like a month it's gonna be huge yeah huge all right

18:05.920 --> 18:11.960
let's get into some news and we'll start it off tonight with Loki and I got some

18:11.960 --> 18:16.200
news over there on the revolution oh yeah they've actually had some

18:16.200 --> 18:21.700
screenshots of Red Steel one of the games is coming to the revolution leaked

18:21.700 --> 18:26.280
to the internet they're actually out of the new issue of Game Informer the May

18:26.280 --> 18:33.280
issue. And you know what? I'm starting to think here that the Revolution might be as

18:33.340 --> 18:38.000
powerful as some of these other systems out there. Especially the next gen stuff. The

18:38.000 --> 18:43.720
pictures look really good actually. And what's interesting is how they describe what you

18:43.720 --> 18:48.720
use the Revolution controller for. For example, the way you hold the controller is actually

18:48.720 --> 18:53.120
the way you hold the gun in the game. So if you want to go gangster and you hold the gun

18:53.120 --> 18:56.800
sideways, your character in game will do that as well.

18:56.800 --> 19:00.120
The other thing which is kind of neat is when you're lobbing grenades you actually use the

19:00.120 --> 19:03.960
controller like you're throwing a grenade or if you want to roll one on the ground ever

19:03.960 --> 19:10.440
so slightly you can do that too which is really neat and use it also as a sword in the game.

19:10.440 --> 19:14.880
But by the screenshots so far I would say this looks pretty on par with even stuff like

19:14.880 --> 19:23.240
Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter, and even the Rainbow Six Vegas, it looks really good.

19:23.240 --> 19:27.840
I'm really shocked, especially since they're saying, you know, that the specs aren't that

19:27.840 --> 19:29.200
great and stuff.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.440
I think it looks really good.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.440
This is a great comment from our chat room right here.

19:32.440 --> 19:38.000
Ota G says, specs don't make a game look good, developers make games look good.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.720
Exactly, and here's the thing too, and a lot of people, when they're looking at these,

19:41.720 --> 19:44.960
they're saying well you know what just because the specs aren't as powerful

19:44.960 --> 19:48.400
because they're not going HD they can use that extra you know

19:48.400 --> 19:51.680
processing power to make it look even better so

19:51.680 --> 19:56.560
Nintendo can't you do a little HD

19:56.560 --> 20:00.040
well they're doing 480p so that's

20:00.040 --> 20:04.200
something. Does that mean widescreen? That's progressive scan. I know it means progressive scan

20:04.200 --> 20:06.000
does that mean I get widescreen too? I think so

20:06.000 --> 20:09.920
so it's something and you know what

20:09.920 --> 20:14.500
Don't know they can always they can change that later. Maybe I don't know but um

20:15.380 --> 20:18.160
Yeah, I don't know. It just looks really good really good

20:18.800 --> 20:25.440
All right now spike. I saw these pictures in your life journal. What do you think of Red Steel? I'm really impressed

20:25.440 --> 20:30.040
I as many others I was really excited about the revolution for the gameplay innovation

20:30.040 --> 20:36.480
I had my my hopes set on maybe we'd see games eventually that looked like Resident Evil 4

20:36.480 --> 20:42.260
I'm already like wow, this is this is past that and I'm really impressed. I'm really happy

20:42.260 --> 20:47.480
The only issue I have with this and in looking at the pictures, I mean the game looks pretty hot

20:47.480 --> 20:51.200
Don't get me wrong and I'm really glad to see that Nintendo, you know, even if this is leaked out

20:51.200 --> 20:53.280
I'm glad to see we're finally seeing something on the revolution

20:53.280 --> 20:59.060
My only hesitation is that I think a gun game using that controller is like the most cliche thing

20:59.060 --> 21:03.720
You could possibly do although I agree with you. It is a game being produced by Ubisoft

21:03.720 --> 21:08.280
First off, that's kind of expected, I'd think, from them.

21:08.280 --> 21:14.400
But that says to me an even deeper message about developers are taking this very seriously.

21:14.400 --> 21:19.320
They're not just making $10 shovelware ports for the revolution, they're actually coming

21:19.320 --> 21:24.080
up with ideas, and even if they're cliche ideas, they're still putting real resources

21:24.080 --> 21:25.080
behind them.

21:25.080 --> 21:29.600
VXJ6V in chat says cliche but it makes sense

21:29.600 --> 21:35.040
I suppose I mean I just I just hope that you I want to see more like the like the

21:35.040 --> 21:38.160
demo with the chopping the vegetables thing now that was

21:38.160 --> 21:41.160
unique are you looking forward to the next Nintendogs

21:41.160 --> 21:44.560
if it's if it's like the DS one I

21:44.560 --> 21:49.040
I really hope they expand on it they announce they announce 50 launch titles

21:49.040 --> 21:52.800
for real 50 launch titles 20 of which are going to be

21:52.800 --> 21:53.800
put out by Nintendo.

21:53.800 --> 21:54.800
Where did you get this?

21:54.800 --> 21:55.800
I haven't heard of this.

21:55.800 --> 21:56.800
I don't remember where I read that.

21:56.800 --> 22:05.060
Well, then I have to take it with a grain of salt if you cannot cite a fact, of course.

22:05.060 --> 22:08.440
But if that's the case, you will see these innovative things, but still though, the thing

22:08.440 --> 22:15.000
about the revolution is they're trying to get away from Nintendo being looked at as

22:15.000 --> 22:19.160
a kid's system, a system that's meant for little kids and that's it.

22:19.160 --> 22:24.700
that's what Microsoft and Sony want you to believe is that the system is meant for younger

22:24.700 --> 22:25.700
crowd when this is...

22:25.700 --> 22:30.680
Well, something tells me this little game with the gun thing is going to dispel that

22:30.680 --> 22:31.680
pretty quick.

22:31.680 --> 22:35.760
Well, I don't know, but it just looks good.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.760
That's all I got to say.

22:37.760 --> 22:42.560
Besides, a Nintendo fanboy's answer to whenever a Microsoft or Sony fanboy presents them with

22:42.560 --> 22:47.960
that is Resident Evil 4, which usually is a GameCube fanboy's answer to everything.

22:47.960 --> 22:52.880
somebody tries to doggone into Resident Evil 4, bitch. Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 4,

22:52.880 --> 22:58.320
bitch. That's great. I've said that exactly, actually. Have you really? I have. I think

22:58.320 --> 23:02.360
everybody should use that in a sentence today. Challenge yourself to tell a friend, Resident

23:02.360 --> 23:12.000
Evil 4, bitch. Snakes on a plane. Shut up. Snakes on a Resident Evil 4. Ah, anyway, if

23:12.000 --> 23:17.040
you're a Nintendo DS fanboy, there's some good news in your future. The Nintendo DS

23:17.040 --> 23:21.460
download stations are making their way around the country, you can actually locate one near

23:21.460 --> 23:31.280
you on Nintendo.com and the Spring 2006 demo series has Mario Kart DS, Tetris DS, Meteos,

23:31.280 --> 23:40.220
Metroid Prime Hunters, Pokemon Trozy, and it also has a preview of Brain Age, Train

23:40.220 --> 23:43.880
Your Brain in Minutes a Day, that game, which I'm really looking forward to trying out.

23:43.880 --> 23:47.140
Even if it does have Sudoku in it, which I'm a little tired of, I think the rest of it

23:47.140 --> 23:48.140
will be pretty cool.

23:48.140 --> 23:49.340
So I'm really looking forward to that.

23:49.340 --> 23:53.740
So I want to try this demo, and True Swing Golf is also another demo in there.

23:53.740 --> 23:58.160
Now, I did a quick search in our area, and it looks like GameCrazy is the chain that's

23:58.160 --> 23:59.160
going to be carrying this a lot.

23:59.160 --> 24:02.740
And GameCrazy is the one that's in Hollywood Video, right?

24:02.740 --> 24:03.900
Some Hollywood Videos.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.860
Some Hollywood Videos have them, but not all.

24:05.860 --> 24:10.140
But the one nearest me has one, and they have a download station, supposedly.

24:10.140 --> 24:12.780
Best Buys are also going to be a huge chain that has them.

24:12.780 --> 24:15.960
again that's just in my area who knows where they are near you

24:15.960 --> 24:20.440
head on over to nintendo.com slash ds download station all one word

24:20.440 --> 24:23.960
to locate a ds download station near you

24:23.960 --> 24:27.140
and all you gotta do you go into download play and they'll all come up right on

24:27.140 --> 24:28.660
there and you choose what you want to download

24:28.660 --> 24:32.340
and here's my tip I learned this at E3 when they did something similar

24:32.340 --> 24:35.540
all you have to do close your ds put it in sleep mode

24:35.540 --> 24:38.940
you can take the ds home with you as long as you don't turn it off demo is still there

24:38.940 --> 24:43.300
Did that with the polarium demo last year for e3 Jesus why that game was awful

24:44.860 --> 24:46.860
Sorry, I liked it enough to buy it

24:47.100 --> 24:53.580
The only game I think I hated more than that was sprung. Otherwise, I thought polarium was a waste of my time

24:54.540 --> 24:57.500
Even now now, what about ping pals? Oh, that's

24:58.340 --> 25:01.700
That's not even a game that that just burns in hell

25:01.700 --> 25:06.260
I gotta love that you gotta wonder if they were developing that game before I think so

25:06.260 --> 25:12.040
I think that was before pictochat was announced and then then when pictochat was announced to be included. They were like, ah fuck

25:16.080 --> 25:18.080
So that's why it's a bargain bin title now

25:18.620 --> 25:20.620
Seriously, you probably find that game for like five dollars

25:20.860 --> 25:23.900
It's not even worth that maybe 99 cents

25:23.900 --> 25:30.240
Like if you can find that game at 99 cent clearance Center or the 98 cent store or whatever then maybe it might be worth

25:30.240 --> 25:34.220
A look but otherwise that game is of the Dollar Tree special

25:34.220 --> 25:38.220
Speaking of the DS, when do the pretty new ones come out, Loki?

25:38.220 --> 25:45.220
Hopefully soon, and the estimated data is gonna be around the same time that, you know,

25:45.220 --> 25:48.220
Mario, or the new Super Mario Brothers is coming out.

25:48.220 --> 25:53.220
Anyways, according to the latest issue of EGM, they're reporting May.

25:53.220 --> 25:57.220
And I think we reported May a while back to, I don't remember what the source was from,

25:57.220 --> 25:59.220
but it looks like it's gonna be May.

25:59.220 --> 26:04.660
I mean, it makes sense, it's right when this brand new game comes in and it would be a

26:04.660 --> 26:09.740
really good packing game, so yeah, I think that's when it's going to happen sometime

26:09.740 --> 26:10.740
mid-May.

26:10.740 --> 26:15.480
Didn't we kind of talk about that last week, like theories were around on the internet

26:15.480 --> 26:20.540
saying that it's possible that the DS Lite, well first Mario Brothers was pushed back,

26:20.540 --> 26:23.060
but then I read that that was actually wrong, it got pushed back up.

26:23.060 --> 26:24.060
It was a week.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.060
They were kind of like...

26:25.060 --> 26:26.060
They've been volleying back and forth.

26:26.060 --> 26:27.060
Yeah.

26:27.060 --> 26:33.740
been with the dates, but now it's back to the 15th, so we totally reported a false story

26:33.740 --> 26:40.180
last week, our bad, but it's back now and maybe for the DS Lite to come out at the same

26:40.180 --> 26:41.180
time.

26:41.180 --> 26:44.540
They would have to announce that, that would have to be like a big surprise thing at E3,

26:44.540 --> 26:49.380
like the DS Lite is coming out and it's on store shelves right now.

26:49.380 --> 26:50.380
Is that feasible?

26:50.380 --> 26:51.380
They could do that?

26:51.380 --> 26:52.700
Pull a Sega Saturn?

26:52.700 --> 26:53.700
They could.

26:53.700 --> 27:01.060
I'm trying to think, yeah, that would actually be the Monday-Tuesday after E3, so yeah, that

27:01.060 --> 27:02.060
makes sense.

27:02.060 --> 27:04.060
There you go.

27:04.060 --> 27:09.780
Alright, moving on, I've got a story for you guys in regards to Mario as well.

27:09.780 --> 27:15.620
There's new postage stamps coming out in Japan that feature the Mario Brothers sprites, and

27:15.620 --> 27:22.400
It's 80 yen to get a 10 stamp sheet, I'm sorry, no it's 80 yen is the value of the stamps

27:22.400 --> 27:26.620
and there's 10 of them, so it would be 800 yen to get one of these sheets.

27:26.620 --> 27:31.980
And there are stamps and they have things like the Cheep Cheeps, Mario, a Koopa, and

27:31.980 --> 27:35.980
then that horrible, horrible sprite of the princess.

27:35.980 --> 27:39.300
It always looked to me like the princess had a bucktooth in that sprite.

27:39.300 --> 27:42.180
I don't know if it's just me, but that's always the way I saw it, it looked like she had funky

27:42.180 --> 27:43.180
teeth.

27:43.180 --> 27:45.100
She was like Princess White Trash, I don't know.

27:45.100 --> 27:49.420
But check that out if you're in Japan, or if you're not in Japan, check out eBay because

27:49.420 --> 27:53.780
I'm sure a lot of these are going to show up for collectors that want to get this stuff.

27:53.780 --> 27:56.980
Super Mario Brothers stamps.

27:56.980 --> 28:02.100
Also in Revolution News, Zookeeper is going to be coming out for the revolution.

28:02.100 --> 28:03.100
Why?

28:03.100 --> 28:08.140
This was from an interview in Nintendo Power, I believe, is where this is from.

28:08.140 --> 28:12.420
And the article mentions that the game is also heading to the Xbox 360.

28:12.420 --> 28:14.340
We're assuming the Xbox Arcade?

28:14.340 --> 28:15.340
Yeah, probably.

28:15.340 --> 28:21.300
Okay, first off, Zookeeper's already on the Xbox Live Arcade except it's called Bejeweled

28:21.300 --> 28:22.900
or Jewel Quest.

28:22.900 --> 28:24.260
Or Zuma, isn't it?

28:24.260 --> 28:26.820
No, Zuma's totally different.

28:26.820 --> 28:30.780
It's either Bejeweled or Jewel Quest, the game's already on there.

28:30.780 --> 28:34.100
So it seems kind of pointless why they would take this on Xbox Live, however, this is why

28:34.100 --> 28:37.900
I think this story is relevant, is that they say it's coming to the revolution.

28:37.900 --> 28:43.840
I cannot fathom that they would release this game as a $39, $49 title.

28:43.840 --> 28:49.000
And without some really frickin' incredible bells and whistles, this game is not worth

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
it.

28:50.000 --> 28:55.280
Like, I'd rather see real animals falling down, not these tiles.

28:55.280 --> 28:58.040
As a DS launch title, it was okay.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.040
But for a revolution title...

28:59.040 --> 29:01.520
It wasn't even a launch title, and it wasn't a very good title.

29:01.520 --> 29:02.800
It's gonna be poopy.

29:02.800 --> 29:07.360
However, what this makes me think, Nintendo Revolution's gonna have a service very similar

29:07.360 --> 29:08.360
to Xbox Live Arcade.

29:08.360 --> 29:11.600
Yeah, of course, everybody's gonna have a service just like that.

29:11.600 --> 29:16.320
Well, I think this kind of just kind of confirms that, and I bet you these old classic titles

29:16.320 --> 29:18.560
are probably fitting into that same scheme.

29:18.560 --> 29:23.440
So not only are you going to be able to download classic titles, but probably these other games

29:23.440 --> 29:25.000
as well, all on the revolution.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.920
I couldn't cite you as a specific source, but I'm pretty sure Iwata-san said something

29:28.920 --> 29:31.320
like that at a game developer's conference.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.320
Oh, probably.

29:32.320 --> 29:35.160
Yeah, he said something about, like, they were going to make titles that were going

29:35.160 --> 29:38.880
to be distributed via the virtual conference.

29:38.880 --> 29:42.840
And I thought I dreamt up this little theory all by myself.

29:42.840 --> 29:43.840
Oh well.

29:43.840 --> 29:44.840
Oh well.

29:44.840 --> 29:45.840
Rain on my parade.

29:45.840 --> 29:46.840
See if I care.

29:46.840 --> 29:50.720
Well anyways, zookeepers coming to both those systems and we do not care here at Orange

29:50.720 --> 29:51.720
Launch Radio.

29:51.720 --> 29:56.500
Loki, I'm so glad we gave you this story tonight.

29:56.500 --> 29:59.240
There's something going on in the Apple world, right?

29:59.240 --> 30:00.880
Yeah, that's right.

30:00.880 --> 30:01.880
Well you know what?

30:01.880 --> 30:02.880
Gaming.

30:02.880 --> 30:06.360
It's not really been a strong thing on the Apple

30:06.360 --> 30:11.360
and now with the Intel chips and the Intel Macs out there.

30:13.440 --> 30:18.440
Basically, Apple, their response to gaming on the Mac

30:18.460 --> 30:20.920
is use Windows.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.040
That's right, because the Mac is useless.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.240
So you have to use Windows.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.880
Anyway, so you can use this program called bootcamp.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.480
They'll let you install Windows XP

30:30.480 --> 30:32.320
without moving your Mac data.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.760
and basically what it'll do is basically a dual boot

30:35.760 --> 30:40.160
in the beginning and you can run Windows XP and it'll run a lot of stuff on there

30:40.160 --> 30:41.240
that's for sure

30:41.240 --> 30:44.460
a lot of games, I can't remember

30:44.460 --> 30:47.660
basically saying

30:47.660 --> 30:51.460
but just a lot of the major games out there right now so

30:51.460 --> 30:56.240
definitely worth checking out if you want to play some games on a Mac

30:56.240 --> 30:58.960
you know what you can already play World of Warcraft on a Mac

30:58.960 --> 31:02.680
which is usually real games but not final fantasy no you can't no

31:02.680 --> 31:04.720
so here here's the thing okay

31:04.720 --> 31:06.280
first off

31:06.280 --> 31:12.060
max do to do something on my i book i have made cds and dvds faster and

31:12.060 --> 31:15.760
prettier than i have on the bc and all that other stuff like how to make a

31:15.760 --> 31:21.520
cd prettier just with all the pretty stuff that apple makes for it to pretty

31:21.520 --> 31:25.220
fire cds like done it

31:25.220 --> 31:29.220
pretty sound I don't know I'm thinking more DVDs okay like pretty menus and

31:29.220 --> 31:31.440
pretty things that I just could not do on the PC

31:31.440 --> 31:34.680
they were just too weird for me you couldn't do

31:34.680 --> 31:38.800
or PC couldn't do look shut up it doesn't matter

31:38.800 --> 31:42.500
my point is my I love my Mac don't get mad at me

31:42.500 --> 31:46.020
get mad at freaking Apple they're the ones saying use Windows so

31:46.020 --> 31:49.340
you know that's that's not stupid that's smart

31:49.340 --> 31:53.840
because now people are gonna go you mean I could do both on one system

31:53.840 --> 31:57.600
that's smart good if you want to get a computer that's pretty

31:57.600 --> 32:01.440
you know then that way you can run Windows and do stuff on Windows

32:01.440 --> 32:04.440
and how is that not the perfect solution it's pretty and

32:04.440 --> 32:08.760
it's pretty and it does everything you need to do you know

32:08.760 --> 32:12.520
that's just like that's just stupid

32:12.520 --> 32:17.580
okay but whatever okay if if you're really confident that Mac OS X or

32:17.580 --> 32:20.720
whatever is great for you know doing your video and

32:20.720 --> 32:24.380
audio or whatever and to be honest it's only better for print media

32:24.380 --> 32:28.040
okay then great use your Mac

32:28.040 --> 32:31.280
OS X for that and then use Windows for everything else

32:31.280 --> 32:34.760
meanwhile I'll use Windows for everything because well it can do

32:34.760 --> 32:37.120
everything that Mac OS X can so

32:37.120 --> 32:40.200
there, you're a jerk

32:40.200 --> 32:46.720
let's move on to another story and this is interesting we always love gaming and

32:46.720 --> 32:47.960
politics stories

32:47.960 --> 32:51.520
uh... there is a conservative political website out there

32:51.520 --> 32:54.900
uh... that was actually defending gaming this week which i thought was very

32:54.900 --> 32:58.220
interesting is national review dot com is the name of the site

32:58.220 --> 33:02.060
and it makes a very interesting bullet points here uh... he kind of

33:02.060 --> 33:04.460
this person who wrote this is adam

33:04.460 --> 33:05.180
fear or

33:05.180 --> 33:07.980
who wrote this story and made some interesting bullet points there

33:07.980 --> 33:11.900
uh... of all the games that were reviewed by the e s r b in two thousand

33:11.900 --> 33:12.820
five

33:12.820 --> 33:16.860
less than thirteen percent were rated mature or adults only

33:16.860 --> 33:21.940
Over 80 percent were either E or T.

33:21.940 --> 33:25.700
Every important social indicator has been improving in recent years, even as

33:25.700 --> 33:28.620
video game use among youths have increased.

33:28.620 --> 33:32.300
Aggregate violent crime by juveniles fell 43 percent between

33:32.300 --> 33:34.660
1995 and 2004.

33:34.660 --> 33:38.540
A quick glance at the back of any game box provides parents with plenty of

33:38.540 --> 33:41.980
information to make decisions for their families. With most new video games

33:41.980 --> 33:45.460
costing between forty and sixty dollars, it's likely

33:45.460 --> 33:49.640
that adults will need to be present when their kids purchase games so kind of

33:49.640 --> 33:52.280
interesting they're coming from a conservative blog

33:52.280 --> 33:55.860
which i don't know kind of is trying to set the stage that makes it look like

33:55.860 --> 33:59.840
liberals are for these gaming restrictions and conservatives are

33:59.840 --> 34:02.880
against them but i don't really believe that because

34:02.880 --> 34:04.560
i live

34:04.560 --> 34:08.440
traditionally vote usually liberal not a hundred percent time usually liberal

34:08.440 --> 34:12.880
and uh... i certainly don't support it i think it's a lack of education on most

34:12.880 --> 34:17.740
politicians and let's not forget to in order for these laws to pass most of the

34:17.740 --> 34:21.020
time in the states and everything it's got to have bipartisan support because

34:21.020 --> 34:24.420
usually you don't pass with just one side of the house but that's just my

34:24.420 --> 34:27.740
wonder how many of these you know actual lawmakers out there are just bored out

34:27.740 --> 34:30.700
of their mind and they just want to go home so they're gonna agree to whatever

34:30.700 --> 34:37.140
you put in front of them no idea but yeah it's kind of it's like another one

34:37.140 --> 34:46.140
of these bills, fine. Just do it. I want to go home and screw a hooker. That's what politicians

34:46.140 --> 34:47.140
do.

34:47.140 --> 34:52.940
Yeah, speaking of M-rated games in which you might be screwing hookers, Loki, there's some

34:52.940 --> 34:55.300
interesting statistics out there this week on M-rated games?

34:55.300 --> 34:58.860
Yes, because Harvard, you know, because they have nothing better to do than, you know,

34:58.860 --> 35:05.660
polls and studies, they found out that an average M-rated game has 104 violent deaths

35:05.660 --> 35:12.700
per hour. Not any of the games I play because there's way more than that, but in your average

35:12.700 --> 35:19.760
game, you know, 104. And basically, you know, the report's conclusion was, parents and physicians

35:19.760 --> 35:24.860
should recognize that the popular M-rated video games contain a wide range of unlabeled

35:24.860 --> 35:27.860
content. No, actually, I think most of the content's labeled on the back there in that

35:27.860 --> 35:34.520
little label that says M, and may expose children and adolescents to messages that may negatively

35:34.520 --> 35:37.840
influence their perceptions attitudes and behaviors

35:37.840 --> 35:39.600
uh... no

35:39.600 --> 35:43.460
i think that it clearly says you know rated m for violence it doesn't say

35:43.460 --> 35:44.540
rated m for

35:44.540 --> 35:49.500
her for violent you know that's permitted me or our whatever

35:49.500 --> 35:54.020
it's stupid only one hundred waste why are they wasting our money on doing

35:54.020 --> 35:55.980
studies like this it means seriously

35:55.980 --> 35:58.960
i could look at a game government that's pretty violent you know what the games

35:58.960 --> 36:02.520
called i'm gonna kill your fucking mother you know i probably know you

36:02.520 --> 36:06.760
probably can guess, hmm, it's pretty violent, you know, instead of, you know, Happy Puppy

36:06.760 --> 36:12.520
Fun Time is not going to have, you know, freaking violent deaths in it. So, seriously, what's

36:12.520 --> 36:17.200
the big deal? Why are they doing studies on this? It's like R-rated movies are bad, okay,

36:17.200 --> 36:21.760
because they have R-rated content. Well, M-rated games are going to have bad content in them

36:21.760 --> 36:23.560
as well, so it makes perfect sense.

36:23.560 --> 36:29.600
Well, my thought is only 104? That's child's play. That's a low score. Haven't you ever

36:29.600 --> 36:34.260
played Smash TV, do you know how many violent deaths occur in the scope of like two minutes

36:34.260 --> 36:41.500
when I'm playing Smash TV? Like you tear through just people among people. Have they seen games

36:41.500 --> 36:45.340
like Dynasty Warriors and 99 Nights and stuff like that? I mean, seriously, you're killing

36:45.340 --> 36:51.820
thousands of people in like minutes. I would like to know what games were sampled. I mean,

36:51.820 --> 36:56.660
I don't know and I don't really care. All I know is like, were you playing a game like,

36:56.660 --> 37:00.120
I don't know like I hate to use this as an example but Driver 3

37:00.120 --> 37:04.500
where like when I play I aim for the people and that's how I play Driver 3

37:04.500 --> 37:04.740
I

37:04.740 --> 37:08.180
purposely try to run over as many people as I can. Shouldn't it be like trying to find a cure for cancer or something other

37:08.180 --> 37:09.620
than doing you know stupid

37:09.620 --> 37:13.940
research like this? I mean what's this actually proof? Wow we knew what we already knew.

37:13.940 --> 37:17.260
Great. Give me my A. You know seriously.

37:17.260 --> 37:24.260
I don't know. That's great. I'm going over to the chat room www.orangelaunchradio.com

37:24.260 --> 37:26.460
click on chat. I think this is very funny.

37:26.460 --> 37:33.620
Dark Tetsuya was responding to all the informations on the back of the box thing from the conservative

37:33.620 --> 37:37.380
blog and he says, yeah, but parents would actually have to check the back of the box.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.180
Oh, that's right.

37:39.180 --> 37:45.040
All the effort to rotate the box, why was I even thinking that, because parents don't

37:45.040 --> 37:50.320
have that kind of energy, let alone to watch kids and monitor what they do.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.320
This is what I think is great.

37:51.320 --> 37:53.860
Can I tell a story about my childhood and my mother from my childhood?

37:53.860 --> 37:54.860
Go ahead.

37:54.860 --> 37:55.860
Okay, here we go.

37:55.860 --> 38:00.020
When I was a kid, my mom would spend like literally an hour at the video store reading

38:00.020 --> 38:03.380
the back of every single box of every movie that's new that week, right?

38:03.380 --> 38:05.860
She's in the store, she's going, do I want to rent this one?

38:05.860 --> 38:09.860
Or do I want to rent the, oh this one sounds violent, I don't know if I want to get that

38:09.860 --> 38:10.860
one.

38:10.860 --> 38:14.020
Or this might be, you know, she'll spend like an hour reading the back of every box.

38:14.020 --> 38:17.460
And then like I'll, you know, take a game that I want to rent, I'll walk up to her and

38:17.460 --> 38:18.980
I'll be like, can I rent this?

38:18.980 --> 38:20.980
And she'll ask me, what's it about?

38:20.980 --> 38:24.440
It's about fun.

38:24.440 --> 38:26.240
Puppies I

38:26.240 --> 38:29.400
Mean, I can I rent Mortal Kombat 2. What's it about?

38:31.040 --> 38:33.040
People playing together

38:33.160 --> 38:37.600
Okay, I mean seriously yet in the same score

38:37.600 --> 38:39.360
I mean, I love my mom to give me in the same

38:39.360 --> 38:42.680
So she would spend like an hour reading the back of all the movie boxes and you know

38:42.920 --> 38:44.920
She'd have to ask me what the game's about

38:45.560 --> 38:48.440
You know, I was thinking like games like Smash TV

38:48.440 --> 38:52.380
How many people you think you get you kill in that game, you know in an average minute?

38:52.380 --> 38:58.960
it. Probably about 104. Probably in a minute. I go more like 300. Are you playing two player

38:58.960 --> 39:03.200
or one player? Yeah, it depends. And somebody in the chat room, Dark Knight mentioned the

39:03.200 --> 39:08.240
sequel Total Carnage, which is probably twice as bad. Exactly, and here's another thing

39:08.240 --> 39:12.520
too. If you're counting violent deaths, say I'm playing a Star Wars game or something

39:12.520 --> 39:18.520
like that and I destroy, you know, like the Death Star or something. How many millions

39:18.520 --> 39:22.320
of people are in the death star I mean that's really gonna throw the

39:22.320 --> 39:29.840
statistic you know out there so I don't know does the AT-ST account for 30

39:29.840 --> 39:34.040
deaths I think that's a good question and it should if it doesn't oh I'm so

39:34.040 --> 39:37.680
glad to know I'm not alone Fireoboma in our chat room says that's the exact same

39:37.680 --> 39:45.840
thing my parents did Skye so I'm not alone in the world good to know moving

40:15.840 --> 40:21.780
to show that there is violence, nudity or whatever else is in the game because it doesn't

40:21.780 --> 40:24.940
go into as much details as you might have thought.

40:24.940 --> 40:29.520
Kimberly Thompson was the study's author and she is concerned that parents might take

40:29.520 --> 40:34.820
this as a sign that the game is just peachy for kids saying that parents should not interpret

40:34.820 --> 40:39.720
the absence of a content descriptor to mean the absence of content.

40:39.720 --> 40:44.980
The study found that 80% of M-rated games included sex, violence, profanity, gambling

40:44.980 --> 40:49.140
or drug and alcohol use, none of which was described on the labels.

40:49.140 --> 40:53.700
This was ran by Reuters. You know, Super Mario Bros. 3 contains gambling as well

40:53.700 --> 40:55.220
because you can yell... It's true.

40:55.220 --> 40:59.140
You know, get your power-ups, you have to match them, and that's like a slot machine.

40:59.140 --> 41:02.060
Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit? I don't...

41:02.060 --> 41:05.940
I mean, come on, why wasn't that rated M?

41:05.940 --> 41:09.580
Um, you know, here's another thing too. I was wondering, maybe we should

41:09.580 --> 41:14.260
change our ranking system to NP for mature rated games, not PG for kids.

41:14.260 --> 41:16.060
I like that better.

41:16.060 --> 41:17.480
Seriously, what do we need to have?

41:17.480 --> 41:20.720
Like a person's decapitated head, you know, that says,

41:20.720 --> 41:22.040
this may contain violence.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.360
Well, I didn't know.

41:23.360 --> 41:26.120
I couldn't tell that the decapitated head

41:26.120 --> 41:27.120
meant violence.

41:27.120 --> 41:27.760
I didn't know.

41:27.760 --> 41:28.680
Maybe that's what we need to do is

41:28.680 --> 41:30.480
start putting little pictures on the thing.

41:30.480 --> 41:33.560
Like, you know, a little decapitated head may contain

41:33.560 --> 41:34.120
violence.

41:34.120 --> 41:37.240
A pair of titties may contain nudity.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.440
Like, just write fuck on the box, you know,

41:39.440 --> 41:42.400
might contain profanity.

41:42.400 --> 41:46.400
Can you imagine what the cover of Grand Theft Auto would look like?

41:46.400 --> 41:49.400
You know what I'm gonna say.

41:49.400 --> 41:53.400
Seriously though, this is why we have to put on like, you know, spray paint bottles, do not eat.

41:53.400 --> 41:59.400
I mean, just because people out there are that fucking retarded that they can't figure this stuff out.

41:59.400 --> 42:04.400
Seriously, if you're that dumb, you know, that you can't understand what the words mean,

42:04.400 --> 42:08.400
maybe you shouldn't be playing games, maybe you should learn how to read instead.

42:08.400 --> 42:13.720
Fireboma would like to point out that Kingdom Hearts 2 has blood in it, maybe it should

42:13.720 --> 42:16.280
be rated M for Slash.

42:16.280 --> 42:21.360
Dark Knight is suggesting some other family friendly games that parents could buy here.

42:21.360 --> 42:26.800
Mary-Kate and Ashley get a clue, that might be a good one for parents to play, that would

42:26.800 --> 42:27.800
be really good.

42:27.800 --> 42:30.760
And then of course now they're talking about Super Mario Brothers hacks because somebody

42:30.760 --> 42:34.680
said Super Titty Brothers which I guess was really a hack that was out there and now they're

42:34.680 --> 42:40.720
talking about all the other hacks super porno brothers out there lame everybody

42:40.720 --> 42:45.640
and their mother did a Super Mario Brothers hack speaking of hacks we have

42:45.640 --> 42:50.600
a story on our old buddy Jackie poo right Loki yes Jackie poo and his modest

42:50.600 --> 42:56.960
proposal a modest proposal part two basically he I don't know what he has

42:56.960 --> 43:01.280
against joystick and why he's reading so much of this website because they'll

43:01.280 --> 43:07.680
report on him I guess you know but anyways he says hey how about a video

43:07.680 --> 43:13.080
game depicting killing of people who run joystick better I bet they'd be real

43:13.080 --> 43:18.360
interested in doing something about a certain game then maybe they would feel

43:18.360 --> 43:22.720
how cops and women feel about Grand Theft Auto oh but that would require

43:22.720 --> 43:27.440
some actual thought and I forgot you're all gamers so joystick is running them

43:27.440 --> 43:32.800
contest now to design a game and stuff and it's to be honest it's real stupid

43:32.800 --> 43:37.480
and yes joystick I love that response joysticks response is to run a contest

43:37.480 --> 43:42.480
encouraging the deaths of joystick bloggers horrifically and the best one

43:42.480 --> 43:46.440
will win a prize or whatever it is I mean that's great I don't understand

43:46.440 --> 43:49.080
what this guy's problem is I mean seriously why is he going out to gaming

43:49.080 --> 43:54.960
blogs I mean that's like because thousands of people rejoicing I rejoiced

43:54.960 --> 44:01.960
you read joystick, you read joystick, you spike your joystick, that's 3 out of 3 right there, 100% of gamers read joystick

44:01.960 --> 44:03.960
100% of us don't care what he says either

44:03.960 --> 44:04.960
I know

44:04.960 --> 44:06.960
I mean, doesn't he understand that that's

44:06.960 --> 44:09.960
See, did you like how I ran that study? That's what other people do

44:09.960 --> 44:13.960
I said 100% of gamers read joystick, because we all do, so that's 100%

44:13.960 --> 44:21.960
You know, that should be our new tagline, 100% of gamers listen to Orange Lounge Radio

44:21.960 --> 44:23.960
Wouldn't that be great?

44:23.960 --> 44:35.960
You know, I'm sorry, but Jackie Pooh needs to seriously, he needs to do something. He needs to get a hobby.

44:35.960 --> 44:42.960
And cause this whole, you know, holy crusade that he's going on is just ridiculous.

44:42.960 --> 44:47.960
I mean, he's like the freaking Batman of the legal world.

44:47.960 --> 44:55.520
I mean he will not stop until he gets revenge with the people who killed people because

44:55.520 --> 44:57.720
they played Grand Theft Auto or something.

44:57.720 --> 45:01.160
Raven's Dolphin in chat says Orange Lounge Radio is next for Jack.

45:01.160 --> 45:02.160
Look out.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.160
You know what?

45:03.160 --> 45:04.980
Hey, here it is right there on the table.

45:04.980 --> 45:10.260
If Jackie Poo wants to come on this show and have a professional interview, as long as

45:10.260 --> 45:14.120
he's prepared to answer the difficult questions, because we don't BS around, I will treat him

45:14.120 --> 45:17.900
with respect and dignity at least for those few minutes that we're having the

45:17.900 --> 45:21.640
interview he is welcome to come on the program and I'll give him a fair shot to

45:21.640 --> 45:25.580
explain his case to gamers but you know what if he starts making fun of us and

45:25.580 --> 45:29.840
saying gamers are you know they're all losers and have no life I'm gonna bring

45:29.840 --> 45:36.180
it right back okay but I am I'm willing to stick out the olive branch if he will

45:36.180 --> 45:40.020
treat us with respect I will treat him with respect and invite him on this

45:40.020 --> 45:44.240
program for a once-in-a-lifetime chance interview with the esteemed host of

45:44.240 --> 45:45.240
Orange Lawn for you.

45:45.240 --> 45:46.240
It's like, seriously, how old is he?

45:46.240 --> 45:48.360
I mean, he's resorting to name calling.

45:48.360 --> 45:55.760
I mean, God, get out of the elementary school, you know, frame of mind here, you know, conduct

45:55.760 --> 45:59.080
yourself like a lawyer and not like a little kid.

45:59.080 --> 46:02.880
Okay, here's the deal, VX JasonXV says in chat, Sky, what happens if he doesn't show

46:02.880 --> 46:04.740
you the same amount of respect?

46:04.740 --> 46:08.300
Then I will do the complete opposite of what I teach to people every day.

46:08.300 --> 46:11.740
I teach customer service for a living and I tell people, take the high road.

46:11.740 --> 46:14.580
No matter what the customers do to you, you take the high road.

46:14.580 --> 46:18.980
However, in this regard, if he takes the low road, I'm going to be right there with him.

46:18.980 --> 46:19.980
I'm going to get ghetto.

46:19.980 --> 46:20.980
Okay?

46:20.980 --> 46:24.260
Just call me the fucking limbo master because I can go lower than he can.

46:24.260 --> 46:25.260
Exactly.

46:25.260 --> 46:29.340
Anyway, now of course the chat room is trying to start a fight there.

46:29.340 --> 46:30.340
Send him an email.

46:30.340 --> 46:31.340
Tell him I said hugs and kisses.

46:31.340 --> 46:34.380
Hey, we contributed to those flowers.

46:34.380 --> 46:35.380
He's just so stupid.

46:35.380 --> 46:36.540
He's getting way too much attention.

46:36.540 --> 46:39.780
Seriously, he's like a little spoiled brat kid.

46:39.780 --> 46:46.900
What else is the gaming community doing in response to Jack's latest tirades and such?

46:46.900 --> 46:52.740
Well, they are wiping their ass with his name, literally.

46:52.740 --> 46:53.740
That's mature.

46:53.740 --> 46:59.900
Yes, in fact, if you want to buy some Jack Thompson toilet paper, they have it available

46:59.900 --> 47:00.900
on jinx.com.

47:00.900 --> 47:04.020
It's only $5.95 for a roll.

47:04.020 --> 47:07.300
The question is, is it two ply or one ply?

47:07.300 --> 47:08.980
That's a lot for a roll of toilet paper.

47:08.980 --> 47:13.540
I mean, you know how, $5.95 at Target will get you like a 12 pack at least of toilet

47:13.540 --> 47:14.540
paper.

47:14.540 --> 47:20.100
That's not a lot of ass to wipe there with the Jack Thompson toilet paper for $5.95.

47:20.100 --> 47:24.600
But every time you used the bathroom, you'd come out smiling.

47:24.600 --> 47:25.600
That's worth something.

47:25.600 --> 47:26.600
Maybe I already do that.

47:26.600 --> 47:30.340
You know what, in case if that's not enough, they also have RIAA toilet paper too, so.

47:30.340 --> 47:31.340
Oh goody!

47:31.340 --> 47:38.380
get a discount if I order them both I don't know I don't condone buying this

47:38.380 --> 47:42.380
because it looks like singleply and not very comfortable and our chat room is

47:42.380 --> 47:48.340
making all sorts of sophomoric comments I'm not gonna read out loud because and

47:48.340 --> 47:54.380
out first grade humor level but it is really we're not it's really I'm not

47:54.380 --> 47:58.380
supposed to encourage it any further it's really funny though so if you're

47:58.380 --> 48:01.300
not in chat right now while you're missing out all right you know that

48:01.300 --> 48:06.300
talking about our old buddy Jackie poo always puts us in a mood right Loki yes

48:06.300 --> 48:12.300
a mood so we have to get moody here and get a little angsty and give out our F

48:12.300 --> 48:15.540
use of the week

48:15.540 --> 48:28.500
Yes, it's time for the FUs of the week.

48:28.500 --> 48:31.500
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight, since Dark Sakura is absent.

48:31.500 --> 48:33.900
FU to whatever made Jamie sick!

48:33.900 --> 48:40.020
Yes, and fuck you to my old- I know this is typical of laptops, but my freakin', like,

48:40.020 --> 48:45.500
crotch is on fire from this stupid laptop, because this thing is so damn hot, it's just

48:45.500 --> 48:47.060
not even funny

48:47.060 --> 48:50.420
could somebody please wiki quote that my crotch is on fire from this laptop

48:50.420 --> 48:52.500
that would be awesome thank you

48:52.500 --> 48:54.500
they're gonna take me down to my page anyways

48:54.500 --> 48:57.100
your wiki quote thing got queued for deletion didn't it

48:57.100 --> 48:59.220
yeah it's because somebody out there is bitter

48:59.220 --> 49:01.720
it's not me i didn't do it yes i know it wasn't you

49:01.720 --> 49:06.140
save the wiki quote page actually somebody suggested to move it to an orange lounge radio

49:06.140 --> 49:09.740
wiki quote page and i like that idea because i want to get quoted once in a while too

49:09.740 --> 49:12.300
i say some pretty profound things in the show once in a while

49:12.300 --> 49:13.300
don't i?

49:13.300 --> 49:14.300
don't i?

49:14.300 --> 49:18.380
yes okay but um save the wiki quote all right anyway

49:18.380 --> 49:23.020
yeah that typical fuck you the slow drivers because they're out there they're out there

49:23.020 --> 49:27.660
in numbers it seems like every time i'm trying to go someplace you know and get there in a timely

49:27.660 --> 49:31.980
matter there's always someone that has to drive 30 miles an hour while you know sticking their

49:31.980 --> 49:35.500
hand out the window protein it's like a fucking wing or something that they're flying a plane

49:35.500 --> 49:41.500
with their hand i'm like fucking drive instead of playing with your goddamn arm so you know that's

49:41.500 --> 49:48.500
Alright, Spike, do you have any FUs you want to give out, or are you in a good, happy,

49:48.500 --> 49:50.900
huggy, tree-hugging mood?

49:50.900 --> 49:54.620
The only FU that I can really think of is it's really minor.

49:54.620 --> 50:01.580
I'm really bothered by the edits that Square Enix made to Kingdom Hearts 2 for a US release,

50:01.580 --> 50:05.400
and they were talking in the chatroom about it, and you know, it's not really a big deal,

50:05.400 --> 50:08.300
and that's absolutely correct.

50:08.300 --> 50:15.480
But it still seems pointless to me to change guns to not look so realistic in Kingdom Hearts.

50:15.480 --> 50:18.780
Do that because Kingdom Hearts they think is more of a kid's game because of the Disney

50:18.780 --> 50:19.780
element?

50:19.780 --> 50:20.780
I would expect so.

50:20.780 --> 50:25.480
I read on, I think it was Kotaku, but don't quote me on that, that it actually helped

50:25.480 --> 50:34.160
them to get a younger rating by changing the guns to look more cartoony, but it bothers

50:34.160 --> 50:40.160
me that such a little thing could make such a big difference, you know? We can't, like,

50:40.160 --> 50:46.480
stop, you know, 187 from, you know, people killing people, but Kingdom Hearts better

50:46.480 --> 50:52.760
take out that gun, or they're gonna have a higher rating. That's ridiculous! Agreed.

50:52.760 --> 50:57.560
Pointless edits. At least release a more adult version as well, or something. I don't know.

50:57.560 --> 51:00.600
Humor me. Make me able to order it off your website or something if you don't want to

51:00.600 --> 51:04.500
be that many copies but but it isn't a big deal so it's not really an f you

51:04.500 --> 51:11.700
it's more of a screw-off but like buzz off bugger off bugger off all right my

51:11.700 --> 51:16.260
f you goes to Konami this week and I realized that this show you know like if

51:16.260 --> 51:21.380
it weren't for DDR we probably be doing this show but I'm seriously Konami fuck

51:21.380 --> 51:25.660
you this week you know why because you are also in the business of making slot

51:25.660 --> 51:31.360
machines and those slot machines stole $60 for me at the casino the other night

51:31.360 --> 51:36.960
so F you you makers of one-armed bandits that steal my money and don't give me

51:36.960 --> 51:44.200
any back although I could definitely go for a Suikoden slot machine yeah how

51:44.200 --> 51:47.800
about a rumble roses slot machine you know what maybe maybe that's a future

51:47.800 --> 51:51.400
list list we need to do a slot machine we'd like to see Konami make this Konami

51:51.400 --> 51:55.160
do the fortune cookie one that one is hilarious it's the most racist slot

51:55.160 --> 51:59.280
machine I've ever seen the fortune cookie and like you play it and if you

51:59.280 --> 52:02.760
get all the fortune cookies then the guy who runs the you know Chinese restaurant

52:02.760 --> 52:06.760
comes up and goes this is mr. lucky's Chinese I'm like it's the most racist

52:06.760 --> 52:10.960
thing I've ever seen in my life one of them and I'm just like is that Konami

52:10.960 --> 52:14.400
that made that I don't know oh no if you win on my money I have no money to buy

52:14.400 --> 52:19.760
rice it's horrible it's horrible I'm saying I'm not making this up go to a

52:19.760 --> 52:23.960
casino if you're over 18 21 whatever the age is in your state go to a casino and

52:23.960 --> 52:27.120
check out that fortune cookie machine it's it's been like actually play it for

52:27.120 --> 52:36.480
a little bit it's bad anyway moving on Loki there is a sequel being made

52:36.480 --> 52:43.480
finally after many failed attempts all a game that I love exactly pilot wings it

52:43.480 --> 52:49.400
makes sense they're gonna put one on the revolution but that's basically rumored

52:49.400 --> 52:57.280
according to EGM on the latest issue. They had it in their rumors section, so it makes

52:57.280 --> 53:02.460
sense. I would think so, especially with the remote, the rev-mote or whatever and the way

53:02.460 --> 53:06.440
you would be able to use that in the game. It sounds like it would be gimmicky enough

53:06.440 --> 53:11.000
to where they would do that. Besides, they have like how many first party games coming

53:11.000 --> 53:15.020
out, you know, lots of them. So you gotta have a Mario Brothers game, you gotta have

53:15.020 --> 53:17.840
have a Zelda game which you know you sort of have Twilight Princess I guess

53:17.840 --> 53:23.180
that kind of counts you know and you would have maybe a Smash Brothers and

53:23.180 --> 53:29.620
maybe Metroid and pilot wings trying to think what else

53:29.620 --> 53:34.140
Pokemon? Pokemon beatdown! I still have a hard time believing that all these games

53:34.140 --> 53:37.460
are gonna be out at launch unless you mean by at launch like the first six

53:37.460 --> 53:42.100
months that I would believe but 50 games like the week the system comes out hell

53:42.100 --> 53:47.460
know hell no why do you think that if anything the first party games will be

53:47.460 --> 53:51.900
there cuz obviously they've been working on those the longest if Nintendo has 20

53:51.900 --> 53:56.500
first party games out on launch day I will do something crazy give me

53:56.500 --> 54:01.580
something to do I will do it well let me see I can't afford it all I can't

54:01.580 --> 54:07.460
remember is 20 20 games or 20 percent of the 50 game oh that's so yeah that's a

54:07.460 --> 54:10.780
little bit now we're changing our story aren't we a little bit I remember the

54:10.780 --> 54:16.960
number 50 50 games but 20% of them how about $50 for 20 games that will be

54:16.960 --> 54:21.900
available in the first month I think that's more realistic I don't know let

54:21.900 --> 54:27.060
we'll just see it at e3 I guess so I'm seeing if the chat room has any

54:27.060 --> 54:31.980
suggestions on what I could do like as a dare if they do if they release 20 games

54:31.980 --> 54:41.560
at launch let's see rub myself in $340 worth of puddin says DJ poo eater how

54:41.560 --> 54:47.100
about this maybe I won't go for $340 however if Nintendo puts out 20 games on

54:47.100 --> 54:50.940
the launch day has to be on the day otherwise it doesn't count if Nintendo

54:50.940 --> 54:56.100
puts out 20 days I will get a six-pack of those jello puddin things and rub it

54:56.100 --> 55:01.820
all over myself live on air can we yeah should we take photos awesome take video

55:01.820 --> 55:04.780
All right, you can do it you do a video and put it on a lot of our PS PS account

55:04.780 --> 55:09.780
But remember Nintendo has to release 20 games on the launch day and it's not gonna happen

55:10.580 --> 55:12.580
So I can feel comfortable saying that

55:13.180 --> 55:15.180
All right

55:15.860 --> 55:20.780
To which our chat room is having a little bit of a scary scary thought there. What did dark Tetsuya have a better idea?

55:22.300 --> 55:29.180
What is it would you say spike in the chat room Oh dark Tetsuya asks, will you go straight if I would go straight?

55:29.180 --> 55:34.500
You know, I think the person I'm seeing will have a big problem with that if I went straight suddenly over a stupid bet

55:34.500 --> 55:38.260
So I think he'd laugh. I can't promise you 50 jello shots

55:38.860 --> 55:40.860
I'll die

55:41.860 --> 55:48.340
No, we'll do it we'll do a pudding we'll do Rob's put an adventure and put it on our PSP if remember

55:48.340 --> 55:49.820
It's got to be 20 games

55:49.820 --> 55:51.820
19 doesn't work

55:51.860 --> 55:54.100
21 maybe I'll get seven

55:54.100 --> 56:01.100
10 packs that rub them all over me. Well wouldn't 20% of 50 be 10 anyways? I'll even do tapioca.

56:01.100 --> 56:11.100
What? Wouldn't 20% of 50 be 10 anyways? Yeah. So how about 10 games? It would make for compelling

56:11.100 --> 56:16.700
radio. I don't know. See, 10 might be realistic to me. How many did they have on GameCube

56:16.700 --> 56:22.460
at launch? They only had like 4 or 5. On the day the system came out, they only had a few.

56:22.460 --> 56:26.440
No, I'm only gonna do 20 cuz I would talk to Jamie. Maybe she'll do it for 10

56:26.440 --> 56:31.960
But I only end of 64. They only have three. I mean three games. I won't I won't do it for 10. Not that yeah

56:31.960 --> 56:36.800
I didn't know I with the video going on all our PSP dot-com and every that's too embarrassing. I can't take that risk

56:36.800 --> 56:39.000
Okay, but what I know 20 is not gonna happen

56:40.920 --> 56:42.920
Moving on oh

56:45.400 --> 56:49.520
This is great radio tonight Jamie's not here to keep us in line. So we're being naughty. Um

56:49.520 --> 56:53.900
Um, Xbox 360 got a new demo this week.

56:53.900 --> 56:56.120
It's the demo for Tomb Raider Legend.

56:56.120 --> 57:01.680
It hit the store and it was on Tuesday, April 4th is when that demo went to the store.

57:01.680 --> 57:02.680
The marketplace.

57:02.680 --> 57:04.840
I keep saying the store, but the marketplace.

57:04.840 --> 57:08.260
I actually went and I downloaded it and it sucked.

57:08.260 --> 57:09.360
I didn't like it at all.

57:09.360 --> 57:11.960
It's pretty, but not pretty enough.

57:11.960 --> 57:16.160
I thought the frame rate was not where it should be for a next gen system.

57:16.160 --> 57:20.880
I felt the gameplay feels about ten years old like an old Tomb Raider game

57:20.880 --> 57:24.820
and I was bored and I didn't even finish the demo. I thought it was

57:24.820 --> 57:25.920
craptacular.

57:25.920 --> 57:26.720
Didn't like it.

57:26.720 --> 57:27.820
Not gonna buy the game.

57:27.820 --> 57:29.680
And I thought the controls were crap too.

57:29.680 --> 57:32.920
It doesn't feel fluid to me.

57:32.920 --> 57:34.200
Unless

57:34.200 --> 57:37.360
something big changes between this demo and the final release

57:37.360 --> 57:40.800
I am no way interested in Tomb Raider Legends.

57:40.800 --> 57:44.540
I watched someone play the game and I did like some of the details that they

57:44.540 --> 57:48.860
hadn't, like the water effects look pretty cool. I thought the water effects were crap! Did you get to a point where you were like

57:48.860 --> 57:52.460
behind the waterfall and the camera would get behind the waterfall? It looked like crap.

57:52.460 --> 57:55.860
It looked like a bunch of snow, like white snow on the screen. No, I didn't see that. But anyways,

57:55.860 --> 58:00.440
I did like the smoke coming out of the guns, even though it looked kind of blocky,

58:00.440 --> 58:03.340
but still kind of neat, and

58:03.340 --> 58:09.100
the voice acting, I guess, was okay, but I don't like Tomb Raider, period, and so

58:09.100 --> 58:13.180
the last Tomb Raider game I played was Tomb Raider 2, and even that, I missed Tomb

58:13.180 --> 58:16.860
Raider 2 playing this demo. I'm sorry I just really didn't like this game. To be honest

58:16.860 --> 58:24.240
Tomb Raider is like less tomb raiding and more I don't know what. And in this game I

58:24.240 --> 58:28.120
think it's a lot of flashbacks. I mean they've been doing this thing with the last few games.

58:28.120 --> 58:32.780
Let's just flashback to different times. Didn't they like kill her off in one of them? I mean

58:32.780 --> 58:38.420
seriously so all these games have to be flashbacks now because they've killed her off. I don't

58:38.420 --> 58:44.020
Gizm in our chat room says Baa on the Tomb Raider hate I like the demo hate to

58:44.020 --> 58:46.820
each their own I'm sure there's people to disagree with me in fact I know there

58:46.820 --> 58:49.820
are in reading some websites and things there's people that disagree with me I

58:49.820 --> 58:54.260
didn't like it I just didn't get what the big deal is didn't sell me on it

58:54.260 --> 58:58.940
sorry maybe it's just not my kind of game I don't know I'm not I'm not huge on

58:58.940 --> 59:03.180
the platformers anymore like I used to like like crash bandicoot and Spyro and

59:03.180 --> 59:07.140
those type of games but I don't know how huge it but that's not true because like

59:07.140 --> 59:10.260
Mario I still like and those types of things so I don't I don't know what

59:10.260 --> 59:17.980
Tomb Raider's problem is but it just I didn't like it sorry moving on to

59:17.980 --> 59:24.620
another story Loki lots of stuff going on with oblivion this week right lots of

59:24.620 --> 59:30.380
controversy and things yeah lots of stuff is more like it they had this

59:30.380 --> 59:34.540
stupid I don't even know why the hell anyone buy this but they had the stupid

59:34.540 --> 59:39.260
thing that they put on the marketplace. It's a horse armor pack. And I remember talking

59:39.260 --> 59:44.580
about this a while back when they announced this. And it's basically, just like it sounds,

59:44.580 --> 59:51.000
horse armor. But it's not different stats or anything, right? I guess your horse is

59:51.000 --> 59:57.060
armored now, a little bit. Here's the thing. It costs you money, first off, 200 Microsoft

59:57.060 --> 01:00:02.660
points, which is I think about 3 bucks, and you have to buy the armor in the game. You

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:07.700
don't just get the armor it just makes it available for purchase so oh see you

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:10.260
don't even get the armored on your horse automatically you still have to work for

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:16.060
it in the game yeah that's crappy and to be honest it looks stupid all right so

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:23.540
basically I'm paying two dollars for a graphic file that's probably you know

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:27.120
400 pixels by 400 pixels that's gonna be laid around my horse and they in a

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:34.160
shapely way that's what I'm paying for well I'm paying for a sprite you're not

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.560
paying for a sprite you're paying for a polygon model though sorry but still

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:44.160
yeah and see the same difference um I don't know I think it's stupid then

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.960
again I know enough people obsessed with oblivion that they're probably excited

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:52.120
about this I wouldn't buy it I'm not buying it and tell you why because one

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:57.360
One, it looks stupid, two, there's no need to have horse armor anyways.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.180
You don't have to ride a horse from town to town because you can automatically travel

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.180
from town to town.

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:06.720
Just go, okay, I want to go to this town, boop, load, there, you're at the town.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:12.280
I mean, you don't have to ride a horse anywhere, it's not required, so who cares?

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:16.000
And besides, I heard there's a part in the game where you can actually get a horse that

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.600
is armored or like undead or something and it basically can't be hurt anyways.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.240
so what's the point in getting horse armor? Anyways.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.880
You know what though, for all of this common sense...

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.400
And you're not going to show it to any of your friends anyways, because the game's not

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:34.560
on live, so... who cares? For all of this common sense though, there

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:39.200
was, I saw on LiveJournal at least, at least 20 people who had talked about purchasing

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:46.200
this pack as a positive thing, as buying upgrades for so small amounts of money being a good

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.400
thing in the direction that gaming is going. Well the next download that they have, when

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.700
I'm not too proud of this either. They're having a patch, they're going to fix all the

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:57.280
infinite money glitches, which sucks, and I personally think they should leave those

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.240
in there because I like cheating, and they're going to add new quests though, but you still

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.240
got to pay for that.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.100
Yeah, here's the deal. If you don't like it, don't buy it, and then they won't try to sell

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:11.920
it anymore. I don't like it because I don't get Halo, well, it's tough, because Halo was

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.800
even weirder because the maps were free, but you could buy them three months in advance

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.880
for so much amount of money. That was always kind of weird to me too. But a lot of things

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:27.220
on the original Xbox, you would be free. Like additional maps and things on different games

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:33.160
and costumes and things. The only things that I remember paying for would be songs and DDR,

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:39.040
which to me is a little different because you're really adding to the game by getting

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:43.960
brand new songs to play and step charts and everything. Maybe people would disagree with

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.960
me and say that's the place.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:50.800
What they did for this is because cameo they have the new costume things and that's what they charge for their costume

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.200
So they took it as an example to charge that for it

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Well, that's kind of crappy too

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:01.840
Cameos retarded in the fact that you can download costumes that do nothing other than reskin the character

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:04.480
But you can dress like killer instinct characters

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.400
Who

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.120
cares

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:16.040
Who cares that doesn't make cameo better including nothing would like or get better. Yes

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.160
Well, that's kind of cool, but I still not gonna pay for that

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.080
I'm not gonna pay for that

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.920
Horse armor

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.360
Seriously, I don't know

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:33.520
Why would you need horse armor? Anyways, I have hard enough time killing somebody. That's a human let alone a horse

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:42.080
worse. What else have they modded in Oblivion lately? Other things that they've modded in

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:49.920
Oblivion. Well, like most things that have to do with the PC, they have released the

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:58.000
topless mod. That's right, your Oblivion characters, or female characters, can go wild. And they

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.240
They have this patch out there, apparently all they've done is removed the clothing.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:08.700
This skin was already in there, so I guess you can kind of almost say, oh noes!

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:12.520
It's you know, hot coffee mod type thing, without sex.

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:19.480
But yeah, pretty much there's really nasty, ugly people, because of course any character

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:23.400
you generate with the character generator is ugly, that are naked.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.800
So really nasty, ugly, naked people.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.800
Enjoy

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:32.640
Why is it whenever there's a game that comes out somebody finds out a way to make the lead character naked

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:37.580
I mean always without fail you want to hear something funny. This is a great story. I don't know

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.120
This is about Tomb Raider. Okay, and about how it might be delayed

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:47.540
Apparently and this is way here. There is a certain scene in the game where

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:53.380
I'm not sure if it's Laura Croft or if it's one of the other like sub characters that's in there

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:59.460
Um, they're wearing these like evening gowns or whatever and apparently the way the physics

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:06.100
in the game work, certain characters pop out during the game and that would be a bad thing

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:10.460
being that this game is almost gold and the fact that I think it's rated teen if I remember

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:12.340
correctly.

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.060
So popping out would not be good.

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:17.460
Uh, Gissom says OMG I need the PC version now.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:18.460
Fap fap fap.

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:22.460
laser123454321 says girls gone wild in oblivion

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:26.540
fireboma says you can be like that guy who is wanking off to world of warcraft

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:30.260
oblivion I think it's great that they have a PC mod thing so you can actually

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:30.940
mod

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:34.620
PC versions but that's another thing too is then why would I want to buy the

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.460
horse armor mod for the PC

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:40.540
if I can just mod it for free

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:46.980
alright moving on we're gonna go to another story here and it's

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:57.980
actually a contest that's right we are giving away some prize packs from 24 the

01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:03.220
game we were kind enough to get passed along some prize packs for 24 the game

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:08.220
we're gonna give it away on tonight's program and all you have to do is send

for Jack24 at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

The prize pack includes a copy of the game,

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:22.380
a CTU T-shirt or a You Don't Know Jack T-shirt,

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:25.860
a 24 mouse pad, a 24 coffee mug,

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:28.860
and a 24 key chain all comes with this.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.420
All you have to do, send us an email,

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.580
Jack24 at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.940
And if you've been watching the show 24 this season,

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.020
you know that the body count

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.300
has been through the roof this season.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.980
It's almost annoying how many people have died,

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:41.860
like tons of people's favorites have died.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:45.580
All you have to do, do a little research, and hopefully you're a fan of the show and

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:51.500
you already know, tell me any two people that have died this season, any two people that

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:55.980
have died this season on the show, and that will qualify you to win the 24 prize pack,

01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:01.100
copy of the game, CTU t-shirt or you don't know Jack t-shirt, 24 mouse pad, 24 coffee

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.900
mug, and a 24 keychain.

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.260
That's Jack24 at OrangeOnTrader.com.

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.580
Any two people that have died in season five of 24.

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:11.500
Random extra number one and random extra number two, that doesn't count.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:14.360
You have to give me names of like actual characters, okay?

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.200
Main characters.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.780
Or even supplemental characters will work,

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:20.360
because main characters is a little vague.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.000
So it's gotta be somebody that has a name.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:23.840
Let's put it that way.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.760
So random extra, like if you saw the episode

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.900
where people were dropping like flies at CTU,

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.860
then work, unless you can name me specific people

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.420
that were involved in that.

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:32.260
Good luck.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.080
Excellent.

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:33.920
Good luck.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.380
By the way, in segment B, we're gonna give away

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:39.020
an Amped 3 prize pack, so stay tuned.

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.140
It's awesome.

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.260
It's a great game.

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:45.340
Alright, moving on, let's go to another story.

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:50.300
We have an open letter from Sony Online Entertainment to PC Gamer Magazine.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.780
This was kind of interesting.

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:55.340
Sony Online Entertainment actually wrote to the magazine.

01:07:55.340 --> 01:08:00.520
You may remember that PC Gamer Magazine said they were no longer going to accept ads from

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.100
Gil sellers and gold sellers and other types of currency sellers.

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.720
They were not going to put this in their magazine.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:10.260
And Sony Online Entertainment wrote this letter and Joystick is actually where I got a copy

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.260
of this letter from.

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:12.620
You can check it out over there.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:18.080
In this letter, they were saying that these companies that sell these and the farmers

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.460
that usually accompany their services have been as much of an issue for our company as

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:24.520
they are for your readers, the people who play online games.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:28.440
Over the last few years, the problems associated with the secondary market have impacted Sony

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.660
Online Entertainment greatly, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, gold farmers are evil, blah,

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:33.860
blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:37.640
But this is the part of the letter I think that's interesting.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.960
We have taken substantial steps towards solving these and other problems, as well as balancing

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:48.380
the desires of those who wish to engage in legitimate real money transactions by launching

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:51.000
station exchange in EverQuest 2.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.160
We will continue to develop innovative solutions in the future."

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:59.760
So in other words what they're saying is that selling things for money is bad unless

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:03.000
it's us doing it, right?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
It's bad, okay?

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.860
As long as we get a cut, it's good.

01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:15.260
Does anything strike somebody funny there about that?

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:17.100
Isn't there a weird inconsistency there?

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:20.980
I mean, couldn't they have just left that part out in their little letter, the little

01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:24.020
plug for their service for selling things for who?

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.020
Yeah, I think so.

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:26.020
Yeah.

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:27.300
I don't know.

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:29.900
Just my thought.

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:31.900
Questions on the 24 contest coming from the chat room.

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:35.300
Firebooma asks, does it have to be from this season?

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:44.860
Yes, they have to be from season 5 for the 24th contest, jack24 at ownersonstrator.com.

01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:50.220
News story, Loki, IGN, what did they report this week?

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:56.180
Reported stuff that I reported weeks ago, basically saying that Tony Hawk's Downhill

01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:58.540
Jam is going to be a Revolution launch title.

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:05.500
I reported this back when we had the activation, or not the activation, the Activision list

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:09.620
from the PlayStation, or Destination PlayStation event.

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:17.280
So blow me IGN, I reported that weeks ago, where were you?

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.460
Maybe you're the source, or something, I don't know.

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:23.720
Well, it'd be surprising to me since they didn't mention the source, so yeah, it could

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.720
possibly be.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:35.360
But hey, what do you expect, another launch game, Tony Hawk, cool.

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.820
One more story for you guys, this segment of the program and it has to do with, who

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.720
doesn't love Bob Ross?

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:47.640
I love Bob Ross, I remember Bob Ross from when I was a kid, I mean who doesn't love

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.560
a white man with an afro, come on, unless he's Napoleon Dynamite.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:52.940
Bob Ross was awesome.

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:59.420
Bob Ross was totally awesome and Bob Ross is actually getting his own video game and

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:01.800
far too late if you ask me.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:06.220
Many people said, �This is an April Fool�s joke, you people are full of shit.� No,

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:07.680
they are not full of shit.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.180
This was not an April Fool�s joke.

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:14.980
IGN is funny enough where we are getting this story from, they actually contacted these

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:22.280
folks directly at the Bob Ross Foundation, I believe it�s called, whoever owns the

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:27.400
rights to him now. They contacted him and they said the press release is not a joke,

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:31.360
but the side effect of people thinking it might help us get noticed. But they really

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:36.100
are going to make a game for the DS and the revolution to teach you how to paint your

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:41.940
own happy little trees. I am so excited. I can't draw for shit, but I will pick up these

01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:48.660
games. Why don't they release this for the PC too? I mean, using a stylus or something?

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:52.200
tablet things, because I know Jamie bought one of those, and she paid good money for

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:57.120
those tablets, and I don't think enough people own those, but I think it's a good idea, but

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.520
yeah, who knows?

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:06.860
My question is, is this the next logical evolution of a Mario Paint type game?

01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:07.860
That's a very good question.

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:12.980
I mean, we haven't seen Mario Paint on any system lately, and I'm kind of surprised we

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:15.160
haven't seen it on the DS yet.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:20.640
Mario Paint seemed like a totally logical idea for the DS especially with the whole dual screen thing

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:26.680
I mean you could be painting on the bottom screen and then like the upper screen can be showing like coordinated music or animation

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.160
I mean, let's face it Mario Paint for the Super Nintendo

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.360
It kind of sucked

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:37.000
I mean a lot of us have fond memories of it and created the end like the things that were in Nintendo Power

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.300
Like I remember Nintendo Power had the little guide and you could create, you know your own little things from it

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:46.620
like the musics and the animations like it would show you how to do it step by

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:50.300
step but in the big scope of things I mean you could only really do like nine

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:55.500
frames of a small animation that's really shitty I mean it's we have fond

01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:01.060
memories of it but it's it really wasn't that great okay but now I think a game

01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:05.140
like that could be pretty awesome especially with hello Wi-Fi I could beam

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:08.820
things you know across this could be like the evolution of PictoChat and

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:12.040
and maybe a way to commercialize Pictochat and get a little money off it

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.620
because think about Mario Paint

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:17.280
could be like something you could chat with people online or I wonder if

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.680
they're gonna include Pictochat as part of the revolution

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:22.660
possibly over the internet who knows

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:26.860
but then are we going to get close to a Picto rape that we're talking about

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:28.220
earlier oh you mean like

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:31.420
well no because you know Nintendo would say everybody has to be on the friends

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:31.900
list

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.540
they have to be your friends list people that's so like did you know in

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.340
Metroid you can't voice chat with people unless they're your friends list people

01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:43.180
Oh. Yeah. So that whole, like, ooh, voice chat. I have maybe, like, two people on my

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:46.300
Metroid friends list, and I haven't really played Metroid lately because of all these

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:48.340
other damn games that have come out, so.

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:53.340
It's a wonder if Bob Ross and his happy little trees, they'll probably be M-rated, you know,

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:54.340
and...

01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:58.900
Yeah, because of the fact that I might be able to paint a penis or a vagina in this

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:03.340
game, which is likely to be the first thing many of you try to paint if you're given a

01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:04.340
like...

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.340
Would it be a happy little vagina?

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:12.340
be a very happy little penis or vagina. Does this game have to be rated M because of what

01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:17.540
you can do with your imagination? I don't know. Can you imagine some parent suing Bob

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:27.860
Ross Foundation or whatever for this horrible, horrific game? My kid painted a penis! And

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:33.780
on that note, I think we're going to go ahead and go to our break. So stay tuned, we'll

01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:47.500
We'll come back at you a little later with Part B of tonight's show.
