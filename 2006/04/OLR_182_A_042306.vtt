00:00.000 --> 00:19.920
Tonight, April 23, 2006, Loki spills tentative release dates for Sony games, many companies

00:19.920 --> 00:24.960
begin announcing their E3 plans, and Kid Whatever, musician from In the Groove, joins us to talk

00:24.960 --> 00:31.960
about the game and his new CD.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.480
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another

00:35.480 --> 00:38.660
edition of Orange Lounge Radio. This is episode number

00:38.660 --> 00:44.680
182 for this April the 23rd, 2006.

00:44.680 --> 00:48.980
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky, not joining us tonight. Dark

00:48.980 --> 00:53.320
Soccer, also known as Jamie Summers, she is off tonight for her birthday

00:53.320 --> 00:57.940
and I can say I did attend her birthday festivities. We went to Dave and Busters last

00:57.940 --> 00:58.840
night in the Bay Area

00:58.840 --> 01:02.400
and watched her get mighty drunk and it was a good time.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.640
So she's recovering today. She probably has a little bit of a hangover. No, I guess she

01:05.640 --> 01:07.000
doesn't really get hangovers

01:07.000 --> 01:10.040
or at least she claims not to, but she's up to no good

01:10.040 --> 01:13.200
either way. And she also gets to be

01:13.200 --> 01:17.320
lazy next week because next week we are not going to be having a show because of

01:17.320 --> 01:21.480
our other co-host right over there, Loki. Yes. What did you do now?

01:21.480 --> 01:23.000
I have to go get married.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
That's right.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.920
Loki's getting married next Sunday.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.920
Congratulations in advance.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.520
So we're not going to be here next Sunday because Jamie and I are obviously going to

01:31.520 --> 01:33.920
the wedding, so we won't be able to do the show.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.400
However, stay tuned to the podcast stream.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.240
We will have something for you guys.

01:37.240 --> 01:40.440
We're cooking up, but we will not be here live, I'm sorry to say.

01:40.440 --> 01:45.200
However, there will be playing live an old classic episode, maybe something that's been

01:45.200 --> 01:49.960
in popular demand for a little while to be replayed now involving a certain karaoke episode.

01:49.960 --> 01:50.960
We'll see.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.040
I have to dig it up if I can find it.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.340
I may have to actually talk to one of our people that archived this show, like Misty

01:56.340 --> 01:59.800
or Angel or something, see if I can dig it up, so we'll see.

01:59.800 --> 02:07.720
For the prosperity of the show, I suppose I could give you the recordings.

02:07.720 --> 02:11.520
We are here to talk about video games that you guys really want to know about, try to

02:11.520 --> 02:13.480
avoid things that suck.

02:13.480 --> 02:16.680
One thing that the critics thought really sucked was the Silent Hill movie that came

02:16.680 --> 02:17.680
out this week.

02:17.680 --> 02:22.160
Of course we have been talking and talking about this movie for a long time hyping this up on the show

02:22.800 --> 02:30.240
Loki did it deliver did it disappoint? What'd you think? Well their excuse was um that they couldn't figure out what was going on the plot

02:30.320 --> 02:31.520
I don't know. I

02:31.520 --> 02:35.120
Seemed critics seemed pretty straightforward to me. I don't know

02:35.680 --> 02:37.440
Yeah, see it didn't

02:37.440 --> 02:40.960
I I think the plot was when of course we're trying to make this spoiler free

02:40.960 --> 02:45.520
So let's be good and not spoil this for anybody because not everybody's seen this but I think the plot

02:45.520 --> 02:51.300
It is open to interpretation, especially at the end, because there have been arguments

02:51.300 --> 02:57.020
on LiveJournal back and forth between me and other people on what the ending really represents,

02:57.020 --> 03:00.260
and does it mean one thing versus another thing.

03:00.260 --> 03:06.020
I think any movie that can get you to talk about it long after you've seen it is a good

03:06.020 --> 03:07.180
movie.

03:07.180 --> 03:10.820
I think movies are things you should be able to talk about.

03:10.820 --> 03:12.840
There are movies of different entertainment values.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.900
movies like you know take Terminator okay that's just bang bang shoot him up

03:15.900 --> 03:18.500
there's nothing to really talk about that's a different type of entertainment

03:18.500 --> 03:22.800
yeah but you know Silent Hill was a different type of film what do you think

03:22.800 --> 03:28.300
though overall you like it didn't like it it was okay it was okay yeah I is

03:28.300 --> 03:33.660
cool I don't know I've really watched that many video game movies so I can't

03:33.660 --> 03:39.940
really say if it's no better or worse than any of them but I would I would say

03:39.940 --> 03:47.640
It's definitely we're seeing it's not bad and it's I think it's pretty good actually even for just a horror movie. It was pretty good

03:48.340 --> 03:52.180
My whole complaint the whole movie is just towards the end. It's a little weird

03:52.180 --> 03:56.620
It's like the second half of the second half starts to fizzle out for me to be honest

03:57.140 --> 04:03.100
What I want to know why wasn't pyramid heads name in the closing credits because he was the fucking star of the movie

04:03.460 --> 04:07.420
Honestly, I realized he was only in like two three scenes, but he stole the movie

04:07.420 --> 04:13.500
He really did you anybody you didn't even have to play the games to know that that pyramid thing is

04:13.660 --> 04:15.260
The scariest thing in the whole movie

04:15.260 --> 04:17.060
I mean seriously cuz you know

04:17.060 --> 04:19.860
I think a lot of you guys have heard about one scene in particular

04:19.860 --> 04:23.360
But I won't say it to spoil it for you guys, but that's not the only like scary moment

04:23.360 --> 04:27.340
I mean, there's another scene that's just like really freaky and I'll tell you what the sound

04:27.860 --> 04:31.240
When pyramid head walks and the sword scraping on the ground

04:31.240 --> 04:39.040
like it was just awesome that was pretty cool I thought that the monsters were

04:39.040 --> 04:44.080
done very well it was very very true to you know the whole storyline so that's

04:44.080 --> 04:52.320
good it was just it was it was well done it wasn't like some crappy you know it's

04:52.320 --> 04:57.960
just a really crappy movie right what do you think best video game movie ever um

04:57.960 --> 05:05.060
well I don't know I mean after all double dragon was pretty good it was it

05:05.060 --> 05:11.400
was um so far is pretty good I wouldn't I don't know if it's gonna be the best

05:11.400 --> 05:17.780
ever but um I liked it it was definitely a very strong start who cares if the

05:17.780 --> 05:19.620
critics don't like it most of the critics didn't know what they were

05:19.620 --> 05:23.300
talking about and we're comparing just saying stupid stuff granted the dialogue

05:23.300 --> 05:26.340
sucked okay yeah the dialogue was my biggest problem with a movie we'll give

05:26.340 --> 05:31.060
them that the plot not being able to be understood it was pretty straightforward

05:31.060 --> 05:36.220
me I was even looking at it in a sense how how could you confuse this I didn't

05:36.220 --> 05:39.780
know I was nearly as bad as critics me I don't I don't understand how they could

05:39.780 --> 05:43.260
be confused at that stuff I personally think they didn't try or this didn't

05:43.260 --> 05:46.180
care something somebody said in my life journal which you know had me thinking a

05:46.180 --> 05:50.060
little bit was the dialogue intentionally bad to be like the games

05:50.060 --> 05:53.940
maybe there were there were some parts that was like

05:53.940 --> 05:57.060
huh why is why is this like

05:57.060 --> 06:01.020
me it seemed like part of the game then there is even some things they're saying

06:01.020 --> 06:03.100
that was like puzzle solving like the game

06:03.100 --> 06:07.820
yeah a little bit stuff so there is it I don't think that's appropriate for a

06:07.820 --> 06:11.600
movie I understand there's that certain fanservice to like make it feel like the

06:11.600 --> 06:12.060
game

06:12.060 --> 06:15.540
but come on pyramid head was fanservice okay pyramid head was not in the

06:15.540 --> 06:16.420
original Silent Hill

06:16.420 --> 06:20.980
but they made it work in the movie and it was phenomenal and it just makes you

06:20.980 --> 06:22.160
want more Pyramid Head

06:22.160 --> 06:26.880
so that was fan service I didn't need the movie to feel like the video game to

06:26.880 --> 06:29.380
be I mean in in in a way it did feel like the game

06:29.380 --> 06:32.860
in everything outside of dialogue like the the fog

06:32.860 --> 06:37.040
ambience and the characters were very Silent Hill and the monsters were

06:37.040 --> 06:41.140
awesome and you know all that stuff I think it was just

06:41.140 --> 06:44.900
it was cool I would have liked to have seen less of

06:44.900 --> 06:49.500
The cult stuff towards the end and more of just the beginning movie. They took the beginning the movie kind of

06:50.360 --> 06:56.060
Doubled that that would have been a really good move. Tell me that siren thing. Isn't the freakiest thing though. I was awesome

06:56.060 --> 06:58.060
It was cool

06:58.460 --> 07:00.460
Yeah, it's just I don't know

07:00.460 --> 07:01.140
All right

07:01.140 --> 07:06.460
I think the first monsters that you see were I thought were the scariest but they're at least the creepiest

07:06.460 --> 07:11.260
I mean, but I don't know that's just me. I and again just for my thoughts

07:11.260 --> 07:16.180
I wasn't like OMG best movie ever and the movie wasn't without its you know, pretty big flaws

07:16.180 --> 07:18.940
But I thought it was good and you know, it's really violent

07:18.940 --> 07:23.860
It totally delivers on the violence and blood and gore thing and it's pretty freaky. It's a different type of scare

07:23.860 --> 07:25.860
It's not slasher movies scary. It's like

07:26.580 --> 07:32.580
WTF question mark exclamation point scary. That's the type of movie you're gonna get so I think it's a good time

07:32.580 --> 07:36.400
It's where it's worth your money at least a matinee if you're too poor to do the you know

07:36.400 --> 07:41.460
$9 $10, you know at night which oh my gosh was what like 1050 to go see the movie

07:41.460 --> 07:47.160
I think no 1025 a ticket because we bought the fandango thing which is you know makes it even more money

07:48.080 --> 07:52.680
Yeah, sucky. We don't even live in that expense. I mean if you if we'd seen it in San Francisco, New York City

07:52.680 --> 07:54.680
LA would have been even more

07:54.720 --> 07:56.720
Kind of sad. All right

07:57.320 --> 08:03.840
Anyway, also joining us tonight. Say hello to make sure the mics on over there the 23rd magus also known as Andrew

08:03.840 --> 08:07.000
Yeah, it's been a while. It has been a little while since you've been on the program

08:09.240 --> 08:11.240
Not much else to say about it

08:11.520 --> 08:17.080
Just been away for a long time. Sorry your volumes been pretty bad. I'm just suggesting on the fly there. All right

08:17.080 --> 08:19.580
How's this? They're much better. All right, awesome. Sounds good

08:19.580 --> 08:24.520
So you used to come on the show a lot back in the old days when we weren't doing the podcast thing when we were

08:24.520 --> 08:26.520
Just like a live only thing. Yeah

08:26.520 --> 08:32.800
it was big fun. It was a good time. Back when the show wasn't like kind of crappy like it

08:32.800 --> 08:37.360
is now when it was just plain crappy back in the day. It was broke down ghetto Bamani

08:37.360 --> 08:42.920
radio. Exactly. Well we don't do the Bamani thing. Well I mean we do. We have big music

08:42.920 --> 08:47.600
game thing now. We actually have a special guest tonight who is a big part of music games.

08:47.600 --> 08:52.800
Not Bamani but music games. And we still definitely do our tribute once in a while to music games

08:52.800 --> 08:56.160
but we try to think everything. Yeah, we think as a whole.

08:56.160 --> 09:00.160
Yeah. We're video game fans first, music games is just a subset of that.

09:00.160 --> 09:04.280
Because if we only talked about music games, we wouldn't be able to talk about Silent Hill or

09:04.280 --> 09:08.520
Final Fantasy or Katamari. If you're into music games, though, you should definitely pick up this

09:08.520 --> 09:12.000
month's official PlayStation magazine. They have demos for

09:12.000 --> 09:15.200
Rez, Amplitude, Guitar Man, and

09:15.200 --> 09:18.280
some other game, I don't remember. Uh-huh.

09:18.280 --> 09:22.320
Aren't all these games kinda old? Yeah, they're doing some feature on music games or something.

09:22.320 --> 09:27.080
Somehow I think they got reprinted. I managed to pick up Rez and Guitarman.

09:27.080 --> 09:30.880
They were marketed as used at a local GameStop.

09:30.880 --> 09:34.600
Yes, I don't know. They've been having a lot of the

09:34.600 --> 09:38.440
older games just suddenly popping up on shelves everywhere.

09:38.440 --> 09:42.400
I have no idea why. You know, Rez would make a good PSP game.

09:42.400 --> 09:46.920
It would. Alright, speaking of games, I'd like to start off the show with a little bit of

09:46.920 --> 09:49.920
how was your gaming week? What kind of stuff have you been playing? What have you

09:49.920 --> 09:51.360
been into? Loki, start us off.

09:51.360 --> 10:02.360
I've been playing, well mainly today, I've been playing Mutant Storm Reloaded or whatever that is, and that game is pretty cool.

10:02.360 --> 10:09.360
I'm trying to go through the, what was it, it's not the adventure mode, the other one.

10:09.360 --> 10:18.440
one anyways so I was trying to get up there I'm like rank 2445 or something

10:18.440 --> 10:22.380
now because I I actually have to play through the game I didn't realize you

10:22.380 --> 10:28.320
get more points we played on black belt and stuff so I've been playing everything

10:28.320 --> 10:36.480
I'm up through like oh man I want to say like 65 on yellow belt and then I'm just

10:36.480 --> 10:42.320
starting to replay them all again on Black Belt. The difficulty gets friggin' annoying

10:42.320 --> 10:46.800
just in some of the games. But I'm getting there, so it should turn out pretty well.

10:46.800 --> 10:51.680
And then, I've been playing Burnout again today, and that game I really don't like the

10:51.680 --> 10:59.560
rubber band AI. It's really pissing me off. For example, I crashed one of the cars into

10:59.560 --> 11:05.840
the wall. And I'm in first place, about to beat everything. All of a sudden they spawn

11:05.840 --> 11:10.960
the car in front of me on the other side of like this jump and so I crashed into

11:10.960 --> 11:16.440
the car and then they win I'm like what the fuck was that and so it's just

11:16.440 --> 11:20.680
ridiculous stuff like that the other thing I've been playing of course we

11:20.680 --> 11:25.340
started doing team games in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories and this is

11:25.340 --> 11:29.080
where the game starts to fall apart not necessarily in the fact that team games

11:29.080 --> 11:32.960
suck on it because team games are really fun and actually kind of made the whole

11:32.960 --> 11:38.360
game new again, it's just that the programming that they did for the team games is so horrible

11:38.360 --> 11:42.680
that you cannot, most of the time you can't get them to work. In fact, a lot of times

11:42.680 --> 11:46.580
they'll spawn and you'll be a ball instead of a player, and you'll have to reboot the

11:46.580 --> 11:51.400
whole thing, the whole thing will crash. So, you know, big fuck you to Rockstar for really

11:51.400 --> 11:56.240
dropping a ball and programming the multiplayer in this game, it just completely makes it

11:56.240 --> 12:01.240
unplayable sometimes. So, it's weird, because we have six players team games and it won't

12:01.240 --> 12:06.680
work, but if you do six players just one-on-one, you know, everyone for themselves, it works

12:06.680 --> 12:07.680
fine.

12:07.680 --> 12:12.360
So, that doesn't make any sense at all, but, I don't know, I hope they fix this in the

12:12.360 --> 12:13.360
next one.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.480
Otherwise, someone's gonna need to be punched in the face.

12:16.480 --> 12:20.680
And then, other than that, haven't really played too much else.

12:20.680 --> 12:26.800
I tried playing a little bit more Rubble Roses XX and, I don't know, I'm gonna try playing

12:26.800 --> 12:29.560
through the game just to get some more achievement points.

12:29.560 --> 12:37.400
about it but you know and yeah that's pretty much it all right I've been

12:37.400 --> 12:41.200
playing a couple games this week I checked out brain age on the DS train

12:41.200 --> 12:45.600
your brain in minutes a day it's it's different it's not your typical kind of

12:45.600 --> 12:49.920
game I think if you're going in expecting some type of 20 hours to be

12:49.920 --> 12:52.880
type you know start to finish game you're gonna be a little bit

12:52.880 --> 12:57.040
disappointed that's not the point behind brain training basically what it is is

12:57.040 --> 13:00.120
that you've got a lot of little games like mini games

13:00.120 --> 13:03.520
that you play and it's supposed to get you thinking it's supposed to get your

13:03.520 --> 13:05.960
brain moving it's like brain exercises essentially

13:05.960 --> 13:10.540
for instance one of the game is do 20 math problems as fast as you can

13:10.540 --> 13:13.920
I know that sounds a little cheesy but it's actually kinda fun you know to like

13:13.920 --> 13:16.240
get your brain moving and you have to be

13:16.240 --> 13:19.280
a little bit nerdy I think to like it though because if you're just like

13:19.280 --> 13:22.800
if you're like ew math you're probably not gonna get as big of a thrill out of it

13:22.800 --> 13:26.400
which is cool because it recognizes your handwriting although if you have

13:26.400 --> 13:30.560
crappy handwriting like me, you're gonna have some problems. For instances, I write

13:30.560 --> 13:37.240
my eights. I don't write a big curve, like a big loop. I write two

13:37.240 --> 13:40.440
little circles is how I've always written my eight. I know that makes me

13:40.440 --> 13:44.240
sound retarded, but examine the way you write real fast. I bet you I'm not the

13:44.240 --> 13:47.120
only one that does this. In fact, I know I'm not, because another person complained

13:47.120 --> 13:51.280
about having the same problem. It picks up my eights zeros constantly, so I

13:51.280 --> 13:55.200
had to force myself to write eights the way you're supposed to do it, so that was

13:55.200 --> 13:59.720
tricky. The other problem the game has is with voice recognition there's another

13:59.720 --> 14:00.600
game where

14:00.600 --> 14:03.720
what you're supposed to do is that the name of a color will show up on the

14:03.720 --> 14:04.880
screen like it'll say

14:04.880 --> 14:08.200
red but then word will actually be written

14:08.200 --> 14:12.160
either in the same color or a different color and you're supposed to say not the

14:12.160 --> 14:12.840
word

14:12.840 --> 14:16.320
but the color that the word is written in so it like messes with you a little

14:16.320 --> 14:18.320
bit because even though it might say red

14:18.320 --> 14:22.320
it's in black text you have to say black so you get either red

14:22.320 --> 14:27.040
black yellow or blue well here's the thing the DS has a real hard time

14:27.040 --> 14:27.680
recognizing

14:27.680 --> 14:31.440
recognizing me saying blue like I'll say blue and it goes try again

14:31.440 --> 14:35.360
blue try again blue and it still doesn't work and I'm not the only one that had

14:35.360 --> 14:37.840
this problem my roommate had this problem I've listened to other people

14:37.840 --> 14:39.240
review this game have the same problem

14:39.240 --> 14:43.080
I have the fix for you this is how to get the game to recognize what you're

14:43.080 --> 14:43.600
saying

14:43.600 --> 14:47.480
because and I know this is gonna sound really wrong it's gonna sound really

14:47.480 --> 14:48.320
really wrong

14:48.320 --> 14:51.600
but it works if you don't believe me try it

14:51.600 --> 14:54.920
instead of saying blue say brew

14:54.920 --> 15:00.120
and it works. Just change your L's to an R

15:00.120 --> 15:05.200
and it works. Why am I somehow not surprised? That is completely racist.

15:05.200 --> 15:09.360
You know what? Do it. If you're having problems with the game,

15:09.360 --> 15:10.960
recognize you saying blue. Try

15:10.960 --> 15:15.760
brew brew brew and it'll work. It completely worked for me. It has not

15:15.760 --> 15:18.760
misread me saying blue once yet.

15:18.760 --> 15:22.840
ever since I started talking. I thought Phoenix Wright not recognizing objection was bad.

15:22.840 --> 15:26.120
Exactly.

15:26.120 --> 15:31.320
Alright, so the game is fun. It kinda reminds me of those old puzzle

15:31.320 --> 15:34.360
books that you can get at the supermarket like games magazine I think

15:34.360 --> 15:36.080
was one that would always have little puzzles in it

15:36.080 --> 15:40.480
and the penny press and all those little things. If you like those types of things because

15:40.480 --> 15:44.520
Sudoku is in the game too and you know Sudoku is really big in those magazines

15:44.520 --> 15:48.640
I think you're really gonna like this. And I think it's just kind of a

15:48.640 --> 15:52.880
it's really a groundbreaking game because you know it's been advertised in

15:52.880 --> 15:54.240
Time magazine

15:54.240 --> 15:57.660
and they're showing it on TV in these different style commercials

15:57.660 --> 16:01.320
I think they're really trying to reach a different audience with this game so it's going to be

16:01.320 --> 16:03.800
very interesting to see how well this game does

16:03.800 --> 16:06.960
because they are not trying to reach your typical gamer and I'll tell you

16:06.960 --> 16:07.680
most

16:07.680 --> 16:12.460
typical gamers quote-unquote probably not the folks that listen to this show

16:12.460 --> 16:15.920
but like when I say gamers like those that play like Madden and Halo shoot

16:15.920 --> 16:16.360
em ups

16:16.360 --> 16:19.440
exclusively that don't play a lot of their stuff probably aren't gonna like

16:19.440 --> 16:19.800
this

16:19.800 --> 16:23.280
this is definitely geared towards a different audience but I think it's a

16:23.280 --> 16:24.120
good investment

16:24.120 --> 16:27.280
twenty dollars is a pretty good price for a DS game

16:27.280 --> 16:30.760
and you know what, eh, you get Sudoku which is you know really popular and all that

16:30.760 --> 16:32.440
stuff even though it's a little bit overrated

16:32.440 --> 16:36.200
it'll keep you busy for a long time or just buy it used when it

16:36.200 --> 16:40.080
you know you'll probably see it used in a few weeks. For fifteen. Yeah.

16:40.080 --> 16:44.280
So I got my, I would like to say I got my brain age down to 21

16:44.280 --> 16:48.280
which is really as low as you can go as 20, but the first time I tested because it had

16:48.280 --> 16:49.800
problems picking up blue,

16:49.800 --> 16:55.080
I had to go BRU BRU. My brain age was like 54 or something the first time, it was kinda

16:55.080 --> 16:58.880
sad. Anyway, heading on over to

16:58.880 --> 17:02.280
www.orangelaundryradio.com, click on chat to hear from

17:02.280 --> 17:05.760
our chatters. Let's see, DidYouLoseASock says

17:05.760 --> 17:09.280
I'm dyslexic and I write all my letters backwards. The letters don't appear

17:09.280 --> 17:12.840
backwards. I start and finish writing a letter different than normal people.

17:12.840 --> 17:18.180
So, yeah, those of you that have a different style of writing things might be in for a

17:18.180 --> 17:19.180
shock.

17:19.180 --> 17:20.400
Now, I write my A's kind of funny.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.120
I don't write my A's like most people do.

17:22.120 --> 17:24.440
Most people do like an O with a tail.

17:24.440 --> 17:29.260
I draw mine like a printed letter A, like an upside down E. That's how I write my A's.

17:29.260 --> 17:32.800
And the game recognizes that, so at least I have that.

17:32.800 --> 17:37.080
The game isn't totally stupid, but some of you guys that have weird handwriting things

17:37.080 --> 17:40.800
are going to have some challenges there, so be careful.

17:40.800 --> 17:47.360
Black Wolf, who also does a show over there on all games radio, Black Wolf says Sudoku

17:47.360 --> 17:51.480
is just the side game, it's not part of the main brain age gameplay.

17:51.480 --> 17:56.160
No, it's not a part of the main gameplay, but it does kind of fit along with that same

17:56.160 --> 18:00.560
theme of exercise your brain, and when you go into it, it says Sudoku is a great way

18:00.560 --> 18:04.780
to exercise the cortex part of your brain, all that stuff.

18:04.780 --> 18:10.640
Even though it's like a side game, it fits into the same idea, so it's a little bonus.

18:10.640 --> 18:14.380
Which makes the advertising of the game appropriate, I have that little sticker that says Sudoku

18:14.380 --> 18:17.380
included.

18:17.380 --> 18:24.300
Also the other game I played, this might surprise you, I love Final Fantasy XI, you know this,

18:24.300 --> 18:30.320
I talk about it a lot on this program, I've invested far too many hours into this game,

18:30.320 --> 18:33.340
it's an MMO that sucked away my life.

18:33.340 --> 18:37.460
I'm going to give Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 a negative review.

18:37.460 --> 18:44.140
Here's why, Final Fantasy XI on 360 is not going to work for your typical Xbox 360 gamer.

18:44.140 --> 18:48.300
I feel like I have to give this a negative review because your typical 360 gamer is going

18:48.300 --> 18:54.060
to get so pissed off trying to play this game because there are so many hurdles that you

18:54.060 --> 18:55.180
have to clear.

18:55.180 --> 18:59.900
And for a PC gamer, which is where I started the game, it's okay.

18:59.900 --> 19:08.780
And for PlayStation 2, which didn't really have a good front end like Xbox Live, it worked

19:08.780 --> 19:11.260
out okay to have that whole play online thing.

19:11.260 --> 19:16.740
But for Xbox, where people are so used to being able to just go online and play right

19:16.740 --> 19:21.640
away, this whole play online hurdle is a pain in the ass.

19:21.640 --> 19:26.200
And I understand it's necessary to get the game to be compatible with PC and PlayStation

19:26.200 --> 19:27.200
2.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.200
I'm not an idiot.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.200
I know why it's there.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.720
It really cripples the game.

19:30.720 --> 19:34.940
I'm telling you, you cannot turn on this game and just go and play.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.680
It takes literally, I'm going to time it.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.440
We're going to put a video up on the website.

19:38.440 --> 19:42.960
I'm going to time it and show you that it takes well over a minute from the time you

19:42.960 --> 19:46.440
turn on your Xbox for you to actually log into the game.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.020
That is really annoying.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.400
I'm sorry, there's no easy way to just get in there and go.

19:51.400 --> 19:55.600
You've got to go through that ugly play online thing, which really, they need some type of

19:55.600 --> 19:59.800
quick button or something where I just go right into Final Fantasy 11 and start

19:59.800 --> 20:04.120
with my primary character or something. Here's the other thing I was so excited

20:04.120 --> 20:07.960
to play Final Fantasy 11 on my HDTV because you know widescreen and don't

20:07.960 --> 20:12.120
get me wrong the game is very very pretty and it looks very nice is very

20:12.120 --> 20:19.560
colorful the text is blurry the text is blurry on an HDTV you cannot make out

20:19.560 --> 20:23.200
the number of hit points my character has in the corner yes I've tried

20:23.200 --> 20:27.880
adjusting my TV settings contrast brightness all that stuff I didn't have

20:27.880 --> 20:32.520
to adjust it for any other Xbox game I own and even in adjusting it I can't get

20:32.520 --> 20:36.800
it to look the way it does on my computer it's annoying I couldn't

20:36.800 --> 20:43.040
believe it so I even though I might once in a while play Final Fantasy 11 on my

20:43.040 --> 20:47.160
Xbox 360 and I'm kind of screwed where I can't take it back really I don't I

20:47.160 --> 20:51.700
can't recommend this game because I think people that play Xbox 360 that want

20:51.700 --> 20:55.000
to get into role-playing games are honestly going to want something more like Oblivion.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Yes, Andrew?

20:56.000 --> 21:00.640
Speaking of which, how many massive RPGs does the Xbox 360 have?

21:00.640 --> 21:01.640
I can name one, Oblivion.

21:01.640 --> 21:02.640
That's it.

21:02.640 --> 21:03.640
Well, no, no.

21:03.640 --> 21:04.640
Oblivion is not a massive game.

21:04.640 --> 21:05.640
I know.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.640
It's just a massive RPG.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.640
Okay, sorry.

21:07.640 --> 21:08.640
Huge RPG, not massively multiplayer.

21:08.640 --> 21:09.640
Just huge RPG.

21:09.640 --> 21:10.640
Right.

21:10.640 --> 21:16.040
Personally, I don't think the Xbox 360 caters to that type of gamer, at least not yet.

21:16.040 --> 21:21.080
I mean, I've done a little bit of lurking on forums for the 360 version of Final Fantasy

21:21.080 --> 21:27.720
And these people who have played the demo are just pissed off that it's not the fast

21:27.720 --> 21:31.160
type of game that they're used to, like say Halo.

21:31.160 --> 21:37.600
It's not what the people who would buy a 360 would typically enjoy, so the community might

21:37.600 --> 21:38.840
take a hit on that.

21:38.840 --> 21:42.720
And also the thing that we should all be pissed off about, other than the fact, granted it's

21:42.720 --> 21:48.720
not $60, it's still $50, which is still way too much, the fact that they didn't do anything

21:48.720 --> 21:53.440
with it. The graphics don't look any better, the resolutions aren't any higher, it's just

21:53.440 --> 21:58.360
me. There are, I'll tell you some perks. You can do custom soundtracks with Xbox 360, which

21:58.360 --> 22:02.120
is kind of neat, you know, I'll tell you. You can do custom soundtracks with the PC

22:02.120 --> 22:07.400
too, remember? That doesn't involve hacking. It's not as seamless, it's not as seamless,

22:07.400 --> 22:11.600
it's not as easy. Yes, you can do custom soundtracks, it's not as seamless, you know, it's any idiot

22:11.600 --> 22:15.360
can press the guide button and get custom soundtracks from CDs they've ripped or their

22:15.360 --> 22:17.440
computer if they took a little extra effort.

22:17.440 --> 22:21.320
And you know the fact that you could do live chat in the whole Xbox 360

22:21.320 --> 22:22.240
interface is

22:22.240 --> 22:25.600
kinda neat, although I imagine most PC players are already doing Ventrilo

22:25.600 --> 22:27.000
anyway, so it doesn't matter,

22:27.000 --> 22:31.040
but you know that's... I think the price is actually right because

22:31.040 --> 22:33.440
considering you get the expansion with the game

22:33.440 --> 22:36.720
and everything, I think the price is fair. I think fifty dollars is a fair price for

22:36.720 --> 22:37.760
the game.

22:37.760 --> 22:41.400
I've been reading stories on the internet where people are pissed off

22:41.400 --> 22:45.400
that there's an extra $12.95 fee to go with the game.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.400
It's an MMO, dumbass. Seriously.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.400
I couldn't believe it. I don't know if I was reading on Joystiq or Kotaku.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.400
Yeah, it was just some retard that didn't realize.

22:53.400 --> 23:01.400
It says right on the box in the upper left hand corner, required internet connection, monthly fee.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.400
It says right on the box in small print.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.400
Come on, dumbass. You're playing an MMO. Name me.

23:06.400 --> 23:10.320
Come on, like you're telling me that Grand Theft Auto doesn't have, you know, that has

23:10.320 --> 23:11.320
violence in it?

23:11.320 --> 23:14.240
I didn't know that, it wasn't like it was on the box or anything.

23:14.240 --> 23:18.520
You get these kind of idiots all the damn time is the problem.

23:18.520 --> 23:24.640
Name me, name me three popular MMOs that don't charge a monthly fee.

23:24.640 --> 23:30.160
Anarchy Online, Guild Wars, oooh, I said name three, gotcha.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.820
I don't think Second Life counts.

23:31.820 --> 23:34.640
I don't know, and I'm saying popular, okay?

23:34.640 --> 23:38.640
But you know, it is very popular, but you buy merchandise there.

23:38.640 --> 23:42.200
I am actually more thinking Anarchy Online, I don't think is as popular as some of those

23:42.200 --> 23:43.200
others.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.200
Yeah, Anarchy Online shows.

23:44.200 --> 23:50.400
So, you know, just kind of saying there, there's not a lot of games that don't have a monthly

23:50.400 --> 23:51.400
fee, MMOs.

23:51.400 --> 23:56.880
You look at any of the big ones, World of Warcraft, I can name the third one, RuneScape.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.200
It sucks, but it's popular.

23:58.200 --> 24:01.120
Or Ragnarok on pirated servers, which is what most people are doing.

24:01.120 --> 24:07.860
I guess I forgot to mention. Oh god, now the chat room is just flooding there.

24:07.860 --> 24:12.120
Guild Wars. Yeah, I already said Guild Wars. Maplestory. Oh, I forgot about Maplestory.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.680
Alright, so maybe there's a few. But come on, the popular ones,

24:15.680 --> 24:19.560
World of Warcraft, Lineage, EverQuest,

24:19.560 --> 24:23.840
Final Fantasy, they all have monthly fees. Guild Wars is probably the most popular

24:23.840 --> 24:25.120
one that doesn't have a monthly fee.

24:25.120 --> 24:30.140
And Guild Wars is a good game. I like Guild Wars. But anyway, I just, I can't believe that some guy

24:30.140 --> 24:33.120
I was stupid did not think there was gonna be this extra monthly fee even

24:33.180 --> 24:38.220
Fantasy star online on the Xbox had a monthly fee and it's a bitch to cancel might I add

24:38.300 --> 24:42.380
They will not just stop billing you and you stop playing. It's it's pretty annoying

24:45.580 --> 24:47.140
Anyway, so I'm sorry

24:47.140 --> 24:52.620
I think the only way folks are gonna like this game on 360 is if they know what they're in for and there's probably Final

24:52.620 --> 24:58.780
Fantasy 11 fans all ready to write me an angry email. Okay. Well, look I play Final Fantasy a lot, too

24:58.780 --> 25:08.780
I knew what I was kind of in for on the Xbox, but I'm trying to look at this as a game that people who have an Xbox 360 and maybe have never played an MMO before,

25:08.780 --> 25:11.780
because Microsoft fans really probably haven't played an MMO before.

25:11.780 --> 25:18.780
If you're exclusively an Xbox or Xbox 360 owner, you probably haven't played an MMO before, unless you've played Phantasy Star.

25:18.780 --> 25:20.780
But you certainly haven't played anything about Final Fantasy XI.

25:20.780 --> 25:23.780
This is not the most user-friendly introduction of these games.

25:23.780 --> 25:26.780
It's probably going to turn a lot of people off to it in the future.

25:26.780 --> 25:32.780
Did you know that the day the game came out, they had a major problem as well, where the content IDs weren't working?

25:32.780 --> 25:38.780
So you couldn't even play until like 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time in the evening, which is like midnight East Coast time.

25:38.780 --> 25:41.780
So that first of your 30 free days was a wash for most people.

25:41.780 --> 25:51.780
Well, I can't exactly say that Final Fantasy XI is exactly newbie friendly. It is a very hardcore MMO to start out with.

25:51.780 --> 25:56.260
Alright, I like this.

25:56.260 --> 26:02.820
Chatroom comments here, BlackWolf again says, Dear Sky, your review made me a sad panda.

26:02.820 --> 26:08.220
Love Sephiroth 420 rules.

26:08.220 --> 26:12.980
If you think MMOs with people named Sephiroth are bad, log into Final Fantasy some time.

26:12.980 --> 26:21.020
You'll see Sephiroth and Sephiroth, you'll see Tidus and what's, Yuna.

26:21.020 --> 26:25.020
una, unia, unis, unilesca, uni...

26:25.020 --> 26:28.020
Change one letter from a popular character and you got it.

26:28.020 --> 26:31.700
Everything, everything. Alright so

26:31.700 --> 26:35.580
sorry guys I think the only way I would recommend Final Fantasy 11 on Xbox 360 to you

26:35.580 --> 26:38.960
is if you've played it on another system and you already know what you're in for

26:38.960 --> 26:43.820
because you better be patient. You better make sure you have a USB keyboard.

26:43.820 --> 26:48.460
And if you don't believe me a timed video will be coming to OLRPSP.com very

26:48.460 --> 26:48.860
soon.

26:48.860 --> 26:51.980
You should see the installation time, let alone...

26:51.980 --> 26:55.420
It was an hour to install and then that doesn't even count the patching.

26:55.420 --> 26:59.420
I remember the beta and then trying to find how to take the beta off the

26:59.420 --> 27:02.980
hard drive. That was great. You know what though? On PC it didn't bother me because I

27:02.980 --> 27:05.140
expect that type of thing from PC games.

27:05.140 --> 27:08.260
That's why I think Final Fantasy 11 is a great game on PC and I think it's

27:08.260 --> 27:09.940
passable on PlayStation 2

27:09.940 --> 27:13.140
because PlayStation 2 doesn't have any nice Xbox Live type service

27:13.140 --> 27:16.860
so I think people you know had to expect something like that. But Xbox 360

27:16.860 --> 27:17.860
People are going to be in for a shock.

27:17.860 --> 27:18.860
Okay, I'm done.

27:18.860 --> 27:20.860
I don't want to talk about Final Fantasy XI anymore.

27:20.860 --> 27:21.860
Andrew, what have you been playing?

27:21.860 --> 27:22.860
How was your gaming week?

27:22.860 --> 27:23.860
Oh, how was my gaming year?

27:23.860 --> 27:24.860
No.

27:24.860 --> 27:25.860
No, just this week.

27:25.860 --> 27:26.940
All right, all right.

27:26.940 --> 27:30.020
I've been getting into guitar here a little bit more.

27:30.020 --> 27:32.700
I've got two more songs to go on Expert.

27:32.700 --> 27:37.300
Just can't pass Bark of the Moon or Cowboys from Hell, but it's been a lot of progress.

27:37.300 --> 27:42.940
I've been playing World of Warcraft, happily almost 57 Rogue on Maelstrom, doing a couple

27:42.940 --> 27:52.020
Blackrock Depths runs, 2 of 8 on Shadowcraft, trying to get myself into high-end raiding

27:52.020 --> 27:54.660
guild once I hit 60.

27:54.660 --> 27:59.460
Been playing some res, trying to get into that, can't pass level 5, but the game is

27:59.460 --> 28:04.380
just uber trippy, I'm ashamed of myself that I didn't get into it the first time it came

28:04.380 --> 28:07.220
around.

28:07.220 --> 28:11.300
Actually there's not much else that I can really say about how was my week, but World

28:11.300 --> 28:15.900
World of Warcraft is awesome and is getting better all the time.

28:15.900 --> 28:18.520
Just waiting bated breath for the expansion.

28:18.520 --> 28:23.480
There's still a little bit of controversy about what the new Alliance race is going

28:23.480 --> 28:26.460
to be for the expansion.

28:26.460 --> 28:27.700
There's all sorts of camps going around.

28:27.700 --> 28:30.620
Some people say Ogres, some people say Dranae.

28:30.620 --> 28:36.820
I'm personally hoping for Dranae because they have more of a vendetta against the raid

28:36.820 --> 28:38.340
boss of the expansion.

28:38.340 --> 28:41.220
I still want the panda people.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.220
Pandarins?

28:42.220 --> 28:43.220
Yeah.

28:43.220 --> 28:45.540
Pandarins probably won't make it.

28:45.540 --> 28:47.060
I know, but I still want it.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.060
Oh yeah.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.060
Isn't it nice to want?

28:49.060 --> 28:52.700
Hopefully they'll announce some NPCs, Pandarins, over in Outland.

28:52.700 --> 28:53.700
You think we'll find out at E3?

28:53.700 --> 28:56.040
You think Blizzard's just sitting on it for E3 now?

28:56.040 --> 29:01.820
I know that they were definitely holding out on it until April Fool's Day so they could

29:01.820 --> 29:10.840
unveil the fictional Alliance race as a joke, and they unveiled Wisps with Herma and Death.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.800
But I think definitely they're going to go for an E3.

29:13.800 --> 29:17.760
I'm expecting probably a November release for Burning Crusade.

29:17.760 --> 29:20.860
So E3 is probably when we're going to find out about the new Alliance race.

29:20.860 --> 29:25.440
They don't want to keep us waiting forever, I hope.

29:25.440 --> 29:30.340
All right, well, just looking at some more comments in our chat room here over at orange

29:30.340 --> 29:35.340
orangelandtrader.com click on chat you will bow to me says 50% of MMO names

29:35.340 --> 29:40.140
have Sephiroth in them the other 50% have 420 in them that's very true let's

29:40.140 --> 29:44.420
see what was who said the thing about 69 Oh DJ poo eater says 69 is always a

29:44.420 --> 29:49.340
popular name to use as well so very what are other popular MMO names I see all

29:49.340 --> 29:54.300
the time yeah Lego loss is not like it is always rest damn our name Lego loss

29:54.300 --> 30:00.900
Anyway, we're going to move on, get into some gaming news this week, and first to start

30:00.900 --> 30:02.940
off we're going to talk about release dates, right Loki?

30:02.940 --> 30:03.940
Of course.

30:03.940 --> 30:06.300
Loki got some more release dates he wants to share with you guys, remember that these

30:06.300 --> 30:11.860
are all tentative, but first, if you still don't believe us on these release date things,

30:11.860 --> 30:14.100
like two things got confirmed this week.

30:14.100 --> 30:18.020
First off, Nintendo Power's recent issue, their cover, and what's on the cover of the

30:18.020 --> 30:19.500
latest Nintendo Power?

30:19.500 --> 30:21.780
Castlevania, Portrait of Whatever.

30:21.780 --> 30:25.340
Portrait of Ruin for those people that said Orange Lounge Radio is pulling that name out

30:25.340 --> 30:26.340
of their ass.

30:26.340 --> 30:28.860
Nope, there it is, confirmed by Nintendo Power.

30:28.860 --> 30:29.860
Portrait of Ruin.

30:29.860 --> 30:30.860
And then what was the other thing?

30:30.860 --> 30:33.820
There was the Tony Hawk game you mentioned like a month ago?

30:33.820 --> 30:38.460
Tony Hawk Downhill Jam, it was part of the Destination PlayStation news I did on those

30:38.460 --> 30:42.780
mini podcasts that we had, and apparently no one paid attention to any of that stuff

30:42.780 --> 30:47.900
because they just released all that same info as new this week, including-

30:47.900 --> 30:49.500
Or a no-name site, remember.

30:49.500 --> 30:57.200
including was it the PSP 50 cent game, the Aragon game, let me see what was on my list

30:57.200 --> 31:07.240
here. The Marvel Ultimate Alliance which I think at the time I was calling it Marvel

31:07.240 --> 31:17.360
Legends, that was the working name. And what else was there? Oh, the gun for PSP. What

31:17.360 --> 31:23.240
else do we have here? I don't know. I think that was pretty much all the major stuff that

31:23.240 --> 31:26.320
they were talking about. Oh, Miami Vice, they were talking about that coming out. Well,

31:26.320 --> 31:30.680
let me reaffirm a few more things since I said them before and now people are starting

31:30.680 --> 31:33.880
to listen a little bit. Here's a few more that they still have not mentioned. Okay,

31:33.880 --> 31:40.120
so, granted we have Tony Hawk. These are all new this week or? Well, this is stuff I said

31:40.120 --> 31:44.360
before. Okay. Okay, so before we said Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam for the revolution, okay,

31:44.360 --> 31:49.660
Okay well that's still coming, Marvel Ultimate Alliance is coming on the revolution probably

31:49.660 --> 31:52.540
at launch so that should be good.

31:52.540 --> 31:58.960
We're also having on the PSP Pimp My Ride the Game, remember I said this before, Pimp

31:58.960 --> 32:06.100
My Ride the Game coming to the Xbox 360 and PSP among other joy and rapture.

32:06.100 --> 32:11.220
So remember that, Pimp My Ride the Game coming, Call of Duty is going to be coming to the

32:11.220 --> 32:18.160
PSP at some point as well and of course, you know call duty 3 on the ps3 and Xbox 360

32:18.160 --> 32:21.640
You know, that's not a big surprise there. But I tell us the new ones already

32:21.640 --> 32:26.280
I want to hear the new ones that you posted this week on the site. No one noticed. Okay. Well anyways

32:27.040 --> 32:29.040
The ones I posted I'd

32:29.400 --> 32:31.400
Start off with I toy play 3

32:31.980 --> 32:33.980
Which is coming out. Okay, get to the good stuff

32:33.980 --> 32:41.020
Okay, SOCOM Combined Assault, this was also announced on other sites too.

32:41.020 --> 32:43.540
They're talking about this game coming out and that's actually supposed to be coming

32:43.540 --> 32:45.900
out on November 15th.

32:45.900 --> 32:52.460
Gangs of London, which is the getaway series spinoff, that's coming also on November 15th.

32:52.460 --> 32:57.620
SOCOM Fireteam Bravo 2, also on the 15th on the PSP.

32:57.620 --> 33:03.160
The next Ratchet and Clank game coming to the PSP, that's actually in 2007 on Valentine's

33:03.160 --> 33:11.160
And the day after that, God of War 2 will be coming out on February 15th, which is awesome.

33:11.160 --> 33:18.160
And there are some sports games as well, NBA 07 coming out in October on PS2.

33:18.160 --> 33:21.160
Rogue Galaxy on October 4th.

33:21.160 --> 33:29.160
And then if you're an ATV fan, ATV Offroad Fury 4 coming out on Playstation 2 September 27th.

33:29.160 --> 33:37.800
and ATV Offroad Fury Pro on the PSP on October 18th, which is going to be pretty cool.

33:37.800 --> 33:46.000
Then, from Square Enix, we have Valkyrie Profile Lenith coming out on July 19th.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Not that far away.

33:47.000 --> 33:52.560
The week before that though, Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Service coming out in the United

33:52.560 --> 33:57.160
States on July 12th.

33:57.160 --> 34:02.160
And Final Fantasy XII for the United States, September 12th.

34:02.160 --> 34:04.100
September 12th is the lucky day, right?

34:04.100 --> 34:05.100
September 12th.

34:05.100 --> 34:10.940
Now, but of course, release dates always subject to change, especially with Squeenix.

34:10.940 --> 34:16.940
Yeah, so this is what is currently, stuff could move around, but this is going to be

34:16.940 --> 34:20.700
the information everyone has right now until we hear otherwise.

34:20.700 --> 34:25.300
Well good job, Loki, keep your ears out there for any other release dates coming up to E3.

34:25.300 --> 34:30.460
Was it, I think in September, Lego Star Wars 2, the original trilogy is coming out.

34:30.460 --> 34:33.740
That was the other one I thought was kind of cool.

34:33.740 --> 34:38.300
But I'm just saying, you know, we had a lot of this stuff from Destination PlayStation.

34:38.300 --> 34:41.460
See no one was reporting on it because no one went to Destination PlayStation.

34:41.460 --> 34:44.660
It's only a retail only event.

34:44.660 --> 34:48.020
Well keep your ears out there in the retail scene so we can, you know, before people catch

34:48.020 --> 34:52.020
on that, you know, that's where we're getting our news.

34:52.020 --> 34:57.780
Anyway, letís get into some other news tonight, talk about games that are officially announced

34:57.780 --> 35:00.520
by the company, even though we all knew it was coming.

35:00.520 --> 35:05.380
Guitar Hero 2 was officially announced, itís going to be coming out.

35:05.380 --> 35:08.540
Guitar Hero 2 was announced earlier, I guess a press conference or something like that

35:08.540 --> 35:12.460
by Red Octane, and of course thereís even a little interview that you can look at over

35:12.460 --> 35:17.280
on IGN, they have a whole little thing going on there, and theyíre going to be able to

35:17.280 --> 35:22.600
do the lead guitar, rhythm guitar, and bass guitar, and so they have it separated into

35:22.600 --> 35:27.800
all those different tracks as well, and there's going to be, I guess, the multiplayer as well

35:27.800 --> 35:32.480
where you can kind of do the separate things going on.

35:32.480 --> 35:35.720
I'm just going to really quickly derail this train.

35:35.720 --> 35:40.280
Before anyone starts calling this innovative, let me remind you Guitar Freaks has been doing

35:40.280 --> 35:45.300
this for years with the whole bass track, in a way, in a way.

35:45.300 --> 35:49.820
55 songs are supposed to be in the game, they're saying also more difficult songs for folks

35:49.820 --> 35:54.120
that have mastered the original, and of course the multiplayer co-op, which I also hinted

35:54.120 --> 35:56.420
at before, that will be coming as well.

35:56.420 --> 36:00.080
No song hints, but we're imagining there's going to be a demo at E3 that ought to give

36:00.080 --> 36:01.680
some of that away.

36:01.680 --> 36:05.740
That and they're also saying that now that they're able, that it's had such a success

36:05.740 --> 36:08.340
with the original, they're able to get bigger name bands now.

36:08.340 --> 36:14.120
Before they were like, huh, so maybe a multi-platform at some point would be nice, but don't hold

36:14.120 --> 36:17.340
your breath because that means I have to do new controllers, but we'll see. Of course

36:17.340 --> 36:20.220
it will work with the old controller, they're not going to screw you into getting a new

36:20.220 --> 36:26.720
controller, which is good news I'm sure. So, we shall see. I'm hoping for some Guar myself,

36:26.720 --> 36:31.900
I would love to see that in Guitar Hero, complete with the costumed people, like, you know,

36:31.900 --> 36:37.660
crowd surfing and all that would be hot. Loki, another confirmation of something I believe

36:37.660 --> 36:42.840
we rumored last week, correct? Yeah, Sony's actually lowered the price of the PS2 down

36:42.840 --> 36:47.240
to $129.99 retail.

36:47.240 --> 36:50.580
And that's not really much of a surprise.

36:50.580 --> 36:54.580
And it's effective as of last week, basically.

36:54.580 --> 36:59.100
And hopefully there's going to be more price cuts coming later.

36:59.100 --> 37:03.180
Maybe one for the 360, that was one other rumor that came out this week.

37:03.180 --> 37:06.460
But definitely worth checking out.

37:06.460 --> 37:10.040
Also, since the day did drop the price of that, you might be able to find the used one

37:10.040 --> 37:16.120
for even cheaper than that. Maybe $99. So, if you still haven't gotten a PlayStation

37:16.120 --> 37:21.680
2 or want another one, I'd probably recommend doing that. Since it seems like they're going

37:21.680 --> 37:28.160
to be supporting PlayStation 2 for a while. Awesome. So, no $99 yet, though, huh? Give

37:28.160 --> 37:34.240
it time. You've got probably Christmas around PS3 launch. About the time. You know what's

37:34.240 --> 37:39.580
interesting, though? $129 is also the cost of a DS, because I lost that bet with Extifer.

37:39.580 --> 37:43.180
was six months since we'd made a bet, and I had to buy his DS today, and that's how

37:43.180 --> 37:44.860
much I paid for it, $129.

37:44.860 --> 37:48.300
So, DS will cost you just as much as a Playstation.

37:48.300 --> 37:52.500
That is until the next DS price drop, which I'm sure is maybe around the time the light

37:52.500 --> 37:53.500
comes out?

37:53.500 --> 37:54.500
I don't know, probably.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.500
Who knows?

37:55.500 --> 37:56.500
Who knows?

37:56.500 --> 38:05.260
Big, big rumor going around this week is from a site, pro-g.co.uk, is Xbox Live Arcade going

38:05.260 --> 38:11.980
to get MAME games as well as SEGA games, that could be very interesting.

38:11.980 --> 38:17.420
There is a Microsoft source, but of course they can't say who, that says, quote, Xbox

38:17.420 --> 38:22.500
Live Arcade has seen some pretty serious deal-making in this first quarter, it's been a real priority.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.840
The deal-making has been a no-brainer for everyone we've spoken to, and aside from a

38:25.840 --> 38:30.460
few licensing issues with existing products, Xbox Live Arcade is going to smash Nintendo's

38:30.460 --> 38:32.320
virtual console to pieces.

38:32.320 --> 38:35.920
Keep in mind that's coming from a Microsoft source, so it's a little bit biased.

38:35.920 --> 38:41.640
Here the quote goes on, I think this is interesting, you've heard of MAME, right?

38:41.640 --> 38:45.860
We're just doing a legal version of MAME, meaning that all the game owners get paid

38:45.860 --> 38:49.240
and the users get quality product based around a community.

38:49.240 --> 38:52.880
Imagine the biggest arcade in the world just a thousand times bigger.

38:52.880 --> 38:57.280
It'll have as many machines as we can possibly get, all with score rankings and other community

38:57.280 --> 38:58.280
stuff.

38:58.280 --> 39:01.840
It's not a secret that MAME was massive for hackers of the original Xbox and the pull

39:01.840 --> 39:05.600
and sales of retro game packs on current machines is still really high.

39:05.600 --> 39:09.960
If this is taken and put under the right noses, it should become the biggest thing in mainstream

39:09.960 --> 39:13.040
hardcore gamer crossover in the industry.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.520
They're also saying that Sega is going to jump on board.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.600
Sega games will be included in a major way.

39:17.600 --> 39:21.840
It's a surprising addition to the deal and will include games that Nintendo will also

39:21.840 --> 39:22.840
be selling.

39:22.840 --> 39:25.240
The Nintendo deal, not exclusive.

39:25.240 --> 39:28.640
Again, take that with a big grain of salt there.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.980
The main thing is a little hard for me to get.

39:30.980 --> 39:34.840
Like I can see maybe using some of the same code, I just couldn't see them calling it

39:34.840 --> 39:35.840
MAME on the Xbox.

39:35.840 --> 39:36.840
No, it's not.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.440
Hello, they've already got arcade games on there.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.440
They're the same thing.

39:40.440 --> 39:44.100
I mean, look, Gauntlet, Smash TV, Robotron.

39:44.100 --> 39:46.100
But those games take a little extra that MAME doesn't.

39:46.100 --> 39:50.620
I mean, because those games have co-op and they have, you know, the Xbox Live achievements

39:50.620 --> 39:54.840
and rankings and things that MAME doesn't exactly have programmed into it.

39:54.840 --> 39:58.740
I think it'd be stupid for them to put like thousands of games on there.

39:58.740 --> 40:05.140
I mean I just I don't because I think that's what Nintendo plans to do slowly, but surely. I don't know I

40:06.180 --> 40:09.380
Mame doesn't seem very like a good way to do it. I

40:10.300 --> 40:16.060
Just I think the idea is there like they're gonna be bringing more arcade games

40:16.060 --> 40:19.940
Maybe I don't think they're gonna call I don't think it's called Mame and I'm not gonna set up under name

40:19.940 --> 40:23.580
I don't know, but that's you know again this be I

40:23.580 --> 40:27.540
I know what it's like and you know what it's like to be on the other side when

40:27.540 --> 40:30.920
you're the site reporting the rumor and have everybody going, oh you guys are

40:30.920 --> 40:31.180
live.

40:31.180 --> 40:35.920
So I don't, you know, I don't know. I think the Sega thing is true. I don't see

40:35.920 --> 40:37.400
why that wouldn't be true.

40:37.400 --> 40:41.760
It makes complete sense to me. Eh, whatever. As long as they put good games on there

40:41.760 --> 40:44.920
where, you know,

40:44.920 --> 40:49.080
where's all my gals' kind of games? That's what we need on Xbox Live Arcade.

40:49.080 --> 40:52.960
Problem for Microsoft though, people are still going to use MAME.

40:52.960 --> 40:56.080
people are still going to hack their Xboxes and put MAME on there

40:56.080 --> 40:59.840
people are still going to use MAME on their PCs most people are still going to do that

40:59.840 --> 41:02.920
most people probably have a 360 probably own a PC

41:02.920 --> 41:07.440
and they'll be like wow MAME on my 360 now I think I'll just play it for free

41:07.440 --> 41:11.240
wait a minute though wait a minute because Gauntlet is still a great selling game

41:11.240 --> 41:15.040
because many of those people are also achievement point whores

41:15.040 --> 41:18.060
so they will buy the game to get 200 achievement points or however many they

41:18.060 --> 41:18.920
can squeeze out of it

41:18.920 --> 41:22.560
huh? yeah by the way

41:22.560 --> 41:26.000
getting achievement points out of Xbox Live arcade games

41:26.000 --> 41:31.200
it's retarded because it's freaking hard comments from our chatroom orange launch

41:31.200 --> 41:33.440
radio click on chat point ratio sucks

41:33.440 --> 41:38.160
Phoenix Rising says I want Neo Geo on live and also says blaster master for

41:38.160 --> 41:38.640
live

41:38.640 --> 41:43.440
that's a good one. Fireboma says the Simpsons arcade game is a classic

41:43.440 --> 41:44.980
that's something that definitely should be on

41:44.980 --> 41:48.580
Xbox Live that would be awesome. Well they're talking about the Ninja Turtles game

41:48.580 --> 41:52.840
Maybe. Ooh, that'd be cool. We shall see.

41:52.840 --> 41:59.480
Alright, uh, moving on, going to the next topic. Loki!

41:59.480 --> 42:04.120
Anyways, um, I can't believe Mame

42:04.120 --> 42:07.880
frickin' retarded. Anyways,

42:07.880 --> 42:10.800
um, so yes, there's this whole thing

42:10.800 --> 42:15.600
that was actually out in one of my nice retail industry magazines talking about

42:15.600 --> 42:16.000
this

42:16.000 --> 42:20.320
brand-new Microsoft portable system that is in the works right now.

42:20.320 --> 42:24.840
Codename the X-Player. It's expected to

42:24.840 --> 42:28.760
arrive in 2007, possibly something they announce at E3.

42:28.760 --> 42:33.880
Anyways, the X-Player is in development in Redmond, Washington according to

42:33.880 --> 42:37.280
Dean Takahashi, author of the upcoming

42:37.280 --> 42:41.840
Spiderworks Press book, The Xbox 360 Uncloaked.

42:41.840 --> 42:50.320
Takahashi previously wrote Inside the Xbox for Prima, basically it has good sources inside

42:50.320 --> 42:52.320
Microsoft.

42:52.320 --> 42:59.160
Basically they're kind of confirming the original rumor saying that Jay Allard and his team

42:59.160 --> 43:06.160
behind Xbox Live is working on a system that will actually play games, movies, and music

43:06.160 --> 43:12.800
basically kind of like a PSP killer. And you know, I guess we'll probably be hearing more

43:12.800 --> 43:17.080
about this. They're talking about maybe working, that Microsoft's also working on their own

43:17.080 --> 43:26.960
digital distribution service, code named Alexandria, which will link the ex-player with this kind

43:26.960 --> 43:33.800
of iTunes-like store. I don't know. Interesting. But it says that Microsoft recently signed

43:33.800 --> 43:42.960
to deal with Epic Records, which is to bring their music exclusively to Xbox Live, actually

43:42.960 --> 43:43.960
their music videos.

43:43.960 --> 43:48.040
I think we've been seeing that actually with the stuff that they've had on Live right now.

43:48.040 --> 43:54.880
So it should be interesting, but this is coming straight out of, well, not a magazine most

43:54.880 --> 43:59.080
people would be reading, but let's see here.

43:59.080 --> 44:06.480
media retailing for all those wonderful video retailers out there sorry I have

44:06.480 --> 44:09.720
my mic on it as I say interesting is that just another fancy name for the

44:09.720 --> 44:12.640
origami because that's what our cat room seems to think no it's not the origami

44:12.640 --> 44:18.000
something completely different hasn't come out yet 2007 for this and this is

44:18.000 --> 44:22.800
something that I've heard earlier was being worked on so if you're looking for

44:22.800 --> 44:28.320
a bomb to be dropped at e3 here it is interesting you know I find it

44:28.320 --> 44:34.040
interesting that in every article like that it says it's going to be a PSP

44:34.040 --> 44:36.640
killer they're gonna compete directly with Sony you notice they're not

44:36.640 --> 44:41.000
Microsoft haven't tried to compete directly with Nintendo whether they

44:41.000 --> 44:45.280
think Nintendo is just beneath them or just not on the league they always try

44:45.280 --> 44:48.880
to go for the brute force approach and we'll try to help out power the other

44:48.880 --> 44:53.000
systems because Microsoft's trying to create Trojan horse entertainment system

44:53.000 --> 44:56.880
that's basically gonna get into your house you buy the 360 because you want

44:56.880 --> 45:01.200
games on it, but oh look now it also records TV, oh look now I can download videos from

45:01.200 --> 45:05.440
the internet, oh look now I can download movies from the internet, and oh look now it's the

45:05.440 --> 45:09.240
center of my entertainment in my household.

45:09.240 --> 45:13.760
Basically kind of what Sony's doing also except being less shady, well I don't know less shady

45:13.760 --> 45:17.220
about it, but you know slightly less shady about it.

45:17.220 --> 45:21.380
That's what they kind of want to do with the PSP because well the PSP UMD movies sucked

45:21.380 --> 45:26.320
and that didn't really take off, but this whole you know e-distribution thing that they're

45:26.320 --> 45:31.460
playing on doing with the PSP, well sure Microsoft wants to get a piece of that action, I mean

45:31.460 --> 45:32.460
why not?

45:32.460 --> 45:36.820
They think that they can defeat Sony in the console world, why not try to defeat them

45:36.820 --> 45:41.380
in the handheld market, and to be honest they don't really see the Nintendo DS as a threat

45:41.380 --> 45:45.620
because it's not playing movies or music or anything like that, so it's just a gaming

45:45.620 --> 45:46.620
system.

45:46.620 --> 45:51.020
Well you've got two companies who market their products as able to do everything, and they

45:51.020 --> 45:55.180
have one apparently backwards little company that just wants to play games.

45:55.180 --> 45:59.580
Well I'm glad it can do everything. To be honest though, it doesn't do everything very well.

45:59.580 --> 46:03.420
It plays music. The internet browser is kinda eh.

46:03.420 --> 46:08.700
And to be honest, it doesn't really support... Unless you're browsing olrpsp.com, which it looks

46:08.700 --> 46:10.660
awesome on. It's a great website.

46:10.660 --> 46:16.340
But anyways, it's just... it's not very easy to browse with, let me put it that way.

46:16.340 --> 46:21.020
You can use it. It's great if you're... Not enough people design just for the PSP.

46:21.020 --> 46:22.100
I think there's a lot

46:22.100 --> 46:26.020
to be milked out at the PSP. And I think you're going to see some pretty innovative things

46:26.020 --> 46:27.620
coming soon. Wink wink nudge nudge.

46:27.620 --> 46:34.380
Oh yeah. Anyway, and then yeah, we have comments from our chat room. Jaded2006

46:34.380 --> 46:34.780
says,

46:34.780 --> 46:38.060
OLR PSP looks awesome on Firefox. Well look,

46:38.060 --> 46:43.980
we don't design it for Firefox. Speaking of which, OLR PSP does have a brand new video

46:43.980 --> 46:45.100
that I've uploaded.

46:45.100 --> 46:48.420
Straight from the bachelor party is me playing

46:48.420 --> 46:52.540
Mario Kart GP and to be honest, what you see on the video

46:52.540 --> 46:56.100
is all I remember of it because I don't remember actually playing the game

46:56.100 --> 47:00.180
I've just watched the videos. Gizm just asked about that in chat. That video is

47:00.180 --> 47:03.620
up. It just went up before the show started tonight, the Mario Kart video, so

47:03.620 --> 47:04.300
check that out.

47:04.300 --> 47:07.340
Did you lose a sock? Comment from our chat room.

47:07.340 --> 47:10.680
You can't have the origami in the X-player. Microsoft is backing the

47:10.680 --> 47:14.020
origami or the UMPC so much. Why would they back both?

47:14.020 --> 47:17.540
Because that one's a PC. This is an actual

47:17.540 --> 47:20.540
video game console interesting

47:20.540 --> 47:24.180
other comments in the chat room you will bow to me says fifty dollars says the

47:24.180 --> 47:26.420
ex-playa will be the size of a fuckin brick

47:26.420 --> 47:30.120
and a spirit snare says sixty dollars the ex-playa will be big

47:30.120 --> 47:33.220
play on the word big there like big as in

47:33.220 --> 47:38.020
you know yeah here's my other question is what will g4 think of this

47:38.020 --> 47:42.700
who cares because it has explained well fire bomb it thinks it'll be the great

47:42.700 --> 47:46.300
repetitive jokes and sarcasm for Morgan Webb and Adam Sessler trying to piss you

47:46.300 --> 47:47.160
off more and more

47:47.160 --> 47:50.840
until you get better just as you can stop playing. But you know what? We're complete.

47:50.840 --> 47:54.040
You know what? I forgot who's gonna dominate the market.

47:54.040 --> 47:58.600
The brand new, um... Phantom? No, not the Phantom.

47:58.600 --> 48:02.360
The Phantom's gone. N-Gage 2.0? Yes, the brand new N-Gage.

48:02.360 --> 48:06.200
And their big, their booth that's in the middle, the front of the door,

48:06.200 --> 48:09.800
doorway there when you walk into E3. When you walk into E3 this year, if you're walking into, what,

48:09.800 --> 48:11.160
South Hall? Is that South Hall?

48:11.160 --> 48:15.280
Yeah. The bigger one? Right when you walk into South Hall, guess what the first booth is you're gonna see?

48:15.280 --> 48:23.200
the pile of crap no it's a big smelly engage booth big smelly engage booth all

like frying over the jungle or something like that so brad or somebody was showing me that

50:13.920 --> 50:18.240

50:18.240 --> 50:21.960

50:21.960 --> 50:27.120

50:37.500 --> 50:40.380
people in the chat room are saying was a better quote from Resident Evil you know

50:40.380 --> 50:44.820
don't don't want to see you in a in a Jill sandwich all right I'm sure you

50:44.820 --> 50:47.820
guys have plenty of additions to that list right IGN tell them you're pissed

50:47.820 --> 50:56.780
um next story Loki yes there's a big e3 email that went out and one things on

50:56.780 --> 50:59.500
there was something mentioning the Revolution.

50:59.500 --> 51:04.160
And what was it, you may ask, well it's going to be a flight game put out by Hudson Soft

51:04.160 --> 51:09.500
and of course we can only speculate what that's going to be like, but it should be fun at

51:09.500 --> 51:10.500
least.

51:10.500 --> 51:16.060
Of course more Revolution stuff going to be shown at E3, playable demos of Red Steel and

51:16.060 --> 51:20.560
that type of thing, but always looking for more innovative stuff, maybe this is the next

51:20.560 --> 51:25.920
pilot wings, now to be honest I don't remember, Hudson's off putting out pilot wings, so doubt

51:25.920 --> 51:32.680
that. Didn't Hudson have something to do though with Smash Brothers Melee? Maybe, I want to

51:32.680 --> 51:37.200
say. That was Hal Labs, not Hudson. Well anyways, basically they said, you know, you're going

51:37.200 --> 51:41.880
to be taking those guys away that you've never experienced before on any home console using

51:41.880 --> 51:47.160
the Revolutions gesture system, which I don't remember what the gesture system is, but I

51:47.160 --> 51:52.780
I imagine it has something to do with the controller, built into their innovative controller.

51:52.780 --> 51:57.620
Hudson's new flight game allows total plane control as players pilot their planes through

51:57.620 --> 52:04.620
various acrobatic flight maneuvers ranging from sky artistry to bomb drops.

52:06.220 --> 52:13.220
They should have like a paper airplane controller attachment or something. Something innovative

52:13.220 --> 52:20.780
There is the part of the show where we would have done the mailbag, however DarkStalker

52:20.780 --> 52:22.580
is not here.

52:22.580 --> 52:31.240
But if you want to send us an email, just send us something over at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

52:31.240 --> 52:36.420
We also have a MySpace, and once in a while we'll get a couple emails in there on the

52:36.420 --> 52:37.420
MySpace.

52:37.420 --> 52:42.160
Our MySpace is located at www.myspace.com.

52:42.160 --> 52:45.240
By the way, love in the comments you guys are leaving for us.

52:45.240 --> 52:48.360
We have some pretty funny listeners.

52:48.360 --> 52:51.840
We leave comments on people's journals and we have about four pictures that we cycle

52:51.840 --> 52:52.840
through.

52:52.840 --> 52:55.680
We're trying to add a couple more to be original, but some people have actually been parodying

52:55.680 --> 52:59.920
those pictures and then reposting them back on our MySpace, which has been pretty funny,

52:59.920 --> 53:02.080
so we appreciate that sense of humor.

53:02.080 --> 53:06.320
I'm going to read a message I got here, and I'm not sure the guy's real name, it's Classy

53:06.320 --> 53:10.300
Plastic Lumber, Plastic Lumber is his display name right now.

53:10.300 --> 53:11.300
You guys rock!

53:11.300 --> 53:15.580
But yeah, I've been listening to your show since the PSP got the RSS feature, and I'm

53:15.580 --> 53:17.060
just now trying to listen in live.

53:17.060 --> 53:20.820
I have the Java chat working well, and I'm still working on the live stream, so hopefully

53:20.820 --> 53:24.440
I'll listen in on Sunday, and you should see me in to chat.

53:24.440 --> 53:28.060
And he gives his nickname there, and let me see, did he make it in to chat?

53:28.060 --> 53:30.320
He did not make it in to chat, so unfortunately he failed.

53:30.320 --> 53:33.620
So here's a little help on how to listen to our show live, for those of you guys that

53:33.620 --> 53:34.940
want to do so.

53:34.940 --> 53:39.300
Head on over to www.orangehonortrader.com, and there's actually a little picture with

53:39.300 --> 53:45.580
the Live 365 logo and if you click on that on Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard

53:45.580 --> 53:48.040
Time that's how you can tune into us live.

53:48.040 --> 53:54.200
Keep in mind we actually go live at 5.30 and we can only have 50 slots for people to listen

53:54.200 --> 53:55.200
live.

53:55.200 --> 54:00.480
We only have 50 slots and that's been filling up lately so we're looking at alternatives

54:00.480 --> 54:05.040
on how we can get more slots without having to pay an assload so that's going to be coming

54:05.040 --> 54:09.880
soon hopefully but for right now you want to get in there 5.30 if you're a

54:09.880 --> 54:12.900
diehard 5.30 is really the best time to get in there because that's when we go

54:12.900 --> 54:17.640
live and Dark Sakura prepares a 30-minute pre-show playlist some type of

54:17.640 --> 54:21.000
theme there for you guys to enjoy tonight it was bootylicious music it

54:21.000 --> 54:25.600
was pretty good there was some like old-school 90s rap in there so you can

54:25.600 --> 54:28.720
listen to that and then we're live and we were here from 6 o'clock till about

54:28.720 --> 54:33.640
8 o'clock 830 whenever we finish and then we do a bonus live show called the

54:33.640 --> 54:37.420
after birth which is just it's insanity we don't even really talk about games we

54:37.420 --> 54:40.780
just talk about it's dick and fart jokes and other fun stuff whatever we feel

54:40.780 --> 54:45.520
like so tune in for that it's a good time all right so again if you want to

54:45.520 --> 54:49.780
send us an actual email it's mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and maybe we'll

54:49.780 --> 54:52.620
read some of those on whatever we do next week because I think we're gonna do

54:52.620 --> 54:55.380
like a mini show or something even though we won't be here live and then

54:55.380 --> 54:59.740
definitely we'll get all caught up on that when we come back I want to say May

54:59.740 --> 55:08.740
May 1st is that show? No, I guess it's going to be the one right before E3, May 7th is when we'll be back, it'll be our big E3 preview show, so look forward to that.

55:08.740 --> 55:16.740
Moving on, let's go back over to Loki, who is going to tell us about a very popular series getting a sequel.

55:16.740 --> 55:20.740
Yes, Command & Conquer 3, it's Hiberian Wars.

55:20.740 --> 55:23.740
It's been officially announced by EA.

55:23.740 --> 55:27.740
And basically, you know, kind of picking up where the last game left off.

55:27.740 --> 55:33.740
It takes place in 2047, and will feature the latest in RTS technology.

55:33.740 --> 55:36.740
Also featuring the GDI, the Brotherhood of Nod.

55:36.740 --> 55:41.740
Just looks pretty cool, and I'm a huge Command & Conquer fan.

55:41.740 --> 55:45.740
I really hope they bring it over to the 360.

55:45.740 --> 55:49.740
Especially Red Alert. I love Red Alert.

55:49.740 --> 55:53.740
Anyways, so that should be coming soon. Hopefully we'll see that at E3.

55:53.740 --> 55:57.740
Hope I get to check it out.

55:57.740 --> 56:01.740
It looks pretty cool.

56:01.740 --> 56:05.740
Alright. Oh, it's coming out in 2007 for Windows PC.

56:05.740 --> 56:09.740
Look for that Command & Conquer fan. That's a series I just couldn't get into.

56:09.740 --> 56:13.740
I understand why people love it. It's just a certain genre of game I don't really play.

56:13.740 --> 56:17.340
You know what though, I loved it for a different reason other than the fact that I loved it

56:17.340 --> 56:20.700
because you can customize it because you can actually mod it using this thing called the

56:20.700 --> 56:25.040
rules.ini file and I can make my own custom troops that were really powerful and stuff

56:25.040 --> 56:27.420
and just completely cheat in the game.

56:27.420 --> 56:31.400
But it made it fun because you could do that, you could send that file to somebody else,

56:31.400 --> 56:34.700
play online, and play with those customized troops.

56:34.700 --> 56:38.580
I thought that was really cool, the whole customization part of it, but eh.

56:38.580 --> 56:45.140
Here's another game people are looking forward to, another highly anticipated sequel, Ridge

56:45.140 --> 56:46.140
Racer 7.

56:46.140 --> 56:49.380
It actually seems a little early for this to me because Ridge Racer 6 hasn't been out

56:49.380 --> 56:53.620
very long, but Namco Bandai did announce Ridge Racer 7.

56:53.620 --> 56:55.300
Here's the kind of catch.

56:55.300 --> 57:01.660
It's going to be developed as a banner title for the PlayStation 3.

57:01.660 --> 57:05.640
This was from Famitsu Magazine, so they have some very sexy screenshots there of Ridge

57:05.640 --> 57:07.860
Racer 7.

57:07.860 --> 57:11.880
Now the question is going to be what's going to look better Ridge Racer 6 or Ridge Racer

57:11.880 --> 57:12.880
7?

57:12.880 --> 57:13.880
Because you know...

57:13.880 --> 57:14.880
7 looks a lot better.

57:14.880 --> 57:18.500
I've seen some screenshots of just one of the cars that they showed.

57:18.500 --> 57:21.420
I couldn't tell that that wasn't a real car.

57:21.420 --> 57:24.900
I mean it looked Project Gotham Racing 3-ish.

57:24.900 --> 57:27.540
You know I mean just that much better.

57:27.540 --> 57:33.180
And that's pretty bad if that's a first gen game and they're already doing what Project

57:33.180 --> 57:34.180
Gotham did.

57:34.180 --> 57:35.180
Easy.

57:35.180 --> 57:40.940
I don't know, we'll see. I think it's going to be awesome and I'm looking forward to it.

57:40.940 --> 57:47.460
I didn't see... I loved Ridge Racer 6. Granted they haven't changed anything since Ridge

57:47.460 --> 57:54.460
Racer 4, or even maybe before that, but so what? You know, it's still the same game,

57:54.900 --> 57:58.500
it's good, it's fun. Burnout, they haven't changed anything in Burnout except for the

57:58.500 --> 58:04.620
cars that have bad AI. Not my favorite racer on the 360, but a solid one. And a long, you

58:04.620 --> 58:09.100
respected series. It sort of makes sense that Namco is going full circle with Ridge Racer 7

58:09.100 --> 58:13.740
being a launch title for the PS3. If you think about it, on the PS1, Ridge Racer is a launch

58:13.740 --> 58:17.580
title there, so maybe they're just trying to reconnect to the Sony crowd. Ridge Racer is a

58:17.580 --> 58:23.100
launch title for the PSP as well. All good points. Ridge Racer 7, if you don't agree with our

58:23.100 --> 58:26.540
opinions, you want to judge for yourself, you're going to get your shot E3 in a couple weeks,

58:26.540 --> 58:30.700
even if you aren't going, you know the media will get to the internet somehow. Now, we don't know

58:30.700 --> 58:34.060
if it's going to be a playable title, because we really don't know the status of PlayStation 3

58:34.060 --> 58:37.660
still for sure uh... but there will definitely at least be a trailer and

58:37.660 --> 58:40.780
they're saying it's called Ridge Racer Vision 2010

58:40.780 --> 58:43.420
so check that out that'll be just a couple weeks

58:43.420 --> 58:47.460
we're like what two weeks away? By the way if you do own Ridge Racer 6 for the

58:47.460 --> 58:48.840
360

58:48.840 --> 58:51.940
I swear to god you gotta constantly watch that marketplace

58:51.940 --> 58:56.320
there was more cars to download they they literally have over like sixty

58:56.320 --> 58:58.740
downloads for Ridge Racer 6

58:58.740 --> 59:00.220
and most of them are free

59:00.220 --> 59:04.480
all the cars are free i've downloaded like threesome cars for the saying

59:04.480 --> 59:07.640
i mean it's excellent you really need to check it out if you haven't yet

59:07.640 --> 59:11.740
and by god by now it should be used for pretty cheap i mean it was one large

59:11.740 --> 59:13.440
cells that no one like

59:13.440 --> 59:17.100
it's definitely one of the many guessing no one liked it

59:17.100 --> 59:20.600
okay it was at the very bottom of the list as far as popularity go i thought

59:20.600 --> 59:25.420
uh... i thought and three was the least i don't know and three i think that even

59:25.420 --> 59:29.300
it was number one in japan well number one launch out of japan but interesting

59:29.300 --> 59:32.900
In the United States, it just bombed, which I don't understand, it didn't look bad.

59:32.900 --> 59:38.580
It wasn't like, you know, I thought it was a pretty good game, but it's fine.

59:38.580 --> 59:40.620
It's a solid game, let's put it that way.

59:40.620 --> 59:44.380
Alright, speaking about E3 coming up in a couple weeks, Loki, news is starting to get

59:44.380 --> 59:48.220
out, who's showing what, huge emails went out to the attendees this week, right?

59:48.220 --> 59:53.260
Yes, of course, and they have the big, you know, kind of like showing, basically advertising

59:53.260 --> 59:57.620
some of the new properties that we're going to see there this year.

59:57.620 --> 01:00:01.460
Some basic ones I've got to mention, Elvion, which is one of the 360 games that looked

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:05.740
really sweet using the Unreal 3 engine, which is interesting.

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:11.900
Desperate Housewives the game, which we mentioned on a different show, which I don't know how

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.140
that's going to translate into a game.

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:20.300
One that I thought was kind of funny, Diet Queen, where you had to try dieting, one of

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.020
those educational games I guess.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.020
Okay.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.020
Or diet trying.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.740
This one's interesting though.

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:30.700
They're actually creating video game tycoon where you get to be a video game design company

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.580
so that one's kind of neat.

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.580
That's cute.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:34.580
Some other things, Bomberman X0.

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:35.580
Oh wait.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:36.580
We talked about that before.

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.580
OG!

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.580
Where did I hear that one already?

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:39.580
Rengoku 2.

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.580
Yeah we talked about that too.

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:41.580
Funny.

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:44.400
Silent Hill fans will be interested to know that there's going to be a mobile version

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.700
coming to cell phones.

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.860
Same with Hellboy.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:50.700
No they won't because cell phone games suck.

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:54.260
Well tell that to the people that own the N-Gage.

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.260
Okay.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.260
Cell phone games suck get a real system

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:06.260
Super Pac-Man as being released by Namco which you know, no surprise there. Of course, um, they're also working on Dragon Spirit

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:10.100
Which should be interesting and Snoopy and the Red Baron because it's got me

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:16.620
The only decent cell phone game I've ever played is Sudoku and that's because it's so doku

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:21.260
It's hard to fuck that this one sound kind of interesting when I read the little thing on it r2 beat

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:25.540
being developed by this company called seed 9 entertainment and it's gonna

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:33.100
combine it's an online rhythm action racing game so I guess that's good it's

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:40.940
basically this is kind of combining both music beat and extreme speed so it

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:46.980
sounds like if I don't know amp was amplitude or whatever was a racing game

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.100
I don't know, it might be kind of neat.

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:54.860
King of Fighters 2006 coming from SNK and a whole bunch of Metal Slug crap, including

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:58.860
the Metal Slug collection, which, you know, I thought they were all the same anyways,

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:01.580
but yeah.

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:02.580
That's basically it.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:05.020
Alright, things to look forward to at E3.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:09.180
Expect a full report on the Diet Revolution, what was that called?

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.180
Diet Girl.

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.180
Diet Girl.

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:12.900
Oh, can't wait to play that.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:13.900
Yes.

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:17.680
I don't know that can be maybe my subtitle on the show in the future

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:22.540
If you'd rather not hear about new stuff

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:27.880
But you're still living in the retro gaming phase and you'll be happy to know or if you just you bought

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:33.700
Oblivion for the 360 and just loved it and you want to know a little more about this series history head on over to

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.620
The elder Scrolls calm because you know what the original Elder Scrolls arena game

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:45.620
game, free download! Enjoy! It's free! Check it out! We like the word free. So what if

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:50.620
the game is years old, you know? Respect the roots, just like Rockstar has Grand Theft

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:54.580
Auto 1 and 2 free downloads, and I think there was another game too that they put out. I

01:02:54.580 --> 01:03:01.580
also have Star Siege Tribes out for free. You can't beat free. Exactly. Alright, Loki.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:06.380
Now if you don't like your gaming free, but you like to spend a little more money, you

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:10.180
You might be able to buy a super special upgrade coming to the 360 soon, right?

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:11.180
Or rumor it anyway.

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:15.380
Yeah, like a $100 HD DVD drive that'll be external.

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:16.380
Cost about $100.

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:20.020
Supposed to be shown at E3.

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.820
Why?

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:29.020
This is interesting to me because didn't HD DVD players just come out for $1,000?

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.580
And now they're saying it's only going to be $100?

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:32.460
That was blurry, I thought.

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:35.780
But yeah, I don't understand why they're releasing this.

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:40.780
For one, I don't understand why they're releasing it as an external drive, because that would look ugly as hell on a 360.

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:47.780
But, I don't think it has the bandwidth through USB to do it, so I don't know how they're planning on pulling across.

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:53.780
Unless it's gonna, you know, kinda slap on top maybe where the hard drive goes or something to run it SATA or something.

01:03:53.780 --> 01:04:03.780
I don't know. But, also kinda related in the same article, they're talking about 100GB hard drive is supposed to be shown at E3 as well.

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:10.900
as well, no price and date available and also the premium pack will be dropped $100 to $299

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:18.780
retail in October and the core system will be $80 less, which is the other story.

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:24.140
I could see that happening because they got to compete with the PS3 when it comes out,

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:30.780
but I don't know about, I don't believe the $100 mark for the system.

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.620
A hundred dollars seems really, really low.

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:38.660
I would have to see, we'd have to see about that because that's kind of, I don't know.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:42.540
That's going to really screw all those other HD DVD stand-alone players, but then again

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:45.420
maybe that's Microsoft once, maybe they're willing to take a hit on it so people get

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:50.020
that gaming system, and as you say, the Trojan horse in their living room, which I've not

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:54.900
really heard you say that before, but I really like that because it's true.

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:59.260
Another Xbox story sure to piss off people that bought their Xbox's launch week.

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:02.900
Yeah, well, this isn't really... they shouldn't be too pissed off about it.

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:07.020
The CPU is getting upgraded. Basically all they're doing is they're

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:08.380
making the same CPU.

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:11.620
It's a bit smaller so it's going to take less power, less heat.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:16.740
That's about it. Although, they're really having many issues with the CPU overheating.

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:19.980
That was never the problem. It was the GPU overheating.

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:24.740
Oh, really? I was just going to say, trust me, those Xbox 360's had problems.

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:28.500
If you don't believe me, go back and listen to the show when I bought my Xbox 360 the same week.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:34.460
Well, all you have to know is it's not going to make your Xbox 360 any faster, so if you

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:40.340
bought it in launch day, whatever, and it's still working, not to worry, and it's not

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:46.140
really expected it's going to cause any compatibility issues, but then again, I've seen them screw

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:49.260
up smaller things, so.

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:57.980
Although hopeful models, hopeful modders might find a way to overclock it with that more

01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:03.340
thermally efficient CPU you think they haven't done it yet they might I don't

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:09.060
think so we shall see well one thing hackers love to do is install Linux on

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:13.780
everything now they don't have to because there's a system coming out just

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:18.540
for them this is coming from Linux devices calm a Linux based handheld

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:22.180
gaming platform that runs native and emulated games as shipping in the US

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:29.960
Game Park's GP2X is powered by a pair of ARM processors, has an open source API and development

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:39.800
tools, and can run thousands of classic console video games, online retailer Dynamism.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.400
The GP2X was originally known as the GPX2.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:52.320
It's got 64 megs of RAM, flash, expandable via an SD card slot, 3.5-inch QVGA LCD monitor

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:59.000
that supports 170,000 colors, 4-way controller and a small thumb joystick on the left, I.O.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.640
ports include stereo headphone jack, USB 2.0, and TV out.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:08.820
And of course, people are loading that crap up with emulators, kind of interesting.

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:11.240
Would anything like this ever make it big?

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.360
No, why not?

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:18.300
this is like total I mean this sounds great it's a total geek thing but hey

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:26.100
it plays thousands of games on it it plays thousands of games it's great but

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:31.140
but where's the challenge of putting Linux on that I mean get this 170 to 200

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:35.900
dollars for this thing is that not cheaper isn't the PSP 199 still I can't

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:41.100
remember what I'm 40 yeah it's about this thing is as much as a PSP and it's

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:43.100
It's just made for developing.

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.100
I don't know.

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.100
Interesting.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:49.100
I'm going to try to see if we can get one of these people on the show.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.100
I want to know more about this.

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:57.100
I know that the GPE 2X or whatever, the original one, they're developing for it right now.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.100
They have a lot of homebrew stuff on there.

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:02.100
Comments from our chat room.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.100
As long as you're ready to dot com, click on chat.

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:07.100
Phoenix Rising says, Linux is still too obscure for it to sell.

01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:12.380
GK128 says you can put a different Linux distro on. That's the challenge.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.820
True. He's got a point. He does have a point.

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:20.260
Moving on.

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:24.320
Loki, also a challenge. If you're a Duke Nukem fan,

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:28.600
convincing yourself that forever will be out any day now can sometimes be a real

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.980
challenge. I'm gonna laugh

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:33.200
if they have this at E3, to be honest, but no, actually

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.520
basically there's an article that I think even came out last week

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.880
about how

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:45.160
George Broussard is basically sick of Duke Nukem Forever and he's

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:50.080
you know from 3D Realms basically saying you know it's taken so long to actually

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.080
develop the game

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:55.040
just right now you know the problem is when they show it off

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.280
you know people are gonna be like eh whatever but they just want to finish it

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.480
they want to get it done get it out there and try to recover some of that

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:06.280
many many dollars spent on developing it. So if this play can work on the sequel that is apparently

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.800
they were talking about working on. I can't believe they're talking about a sequel for

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:14.240
Duke Nukem Forever, I mean... It's called Duke Nukem, no, really. No, really what they

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:18.960
should do is change the name of Duke Nukem Forever. Change it to something else. Yeah,

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:24.600
Duke Nukem Forever isn't coming out, but... It's, uh, Luke... Duke Nukem 3. Luke, Sock

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:30.840
It To Em Forever. I mean, honestly, I think what they should do is they should develop

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:34.640
the game and just release all the partial games that they had, like the one on the Quake

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.280
2 engine, the one on the unreal engine.

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:42.480
Just scrap the name and call it Duke Nukem 4, that's all you gotta do.

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.840
I don't know, we'll see.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:50.080
Do you want to be the first person in the world to play the Nintendo Revolution?

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.960
I bet you do, you little fanboys and girls.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:56.800
Well here's the deal, Nintendo and AOL.com are teaming up and they're going to be having

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.920
a contest.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:03.060
One lucky Nintendo fan gets to go to Los Angeles, touch and play with the revolution before

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:06.880
the conference and then present the machine to the world a few hours later

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.260
at the Nintendo conference. By the way, you're going to the Nintendo conference, aren't you, Loki?

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:14.840
Maybe. I hate you. I hate you. How did you get in?

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:19.020
I've got connections. Oh, you little bitch. I'm not going. Dark Soccer's not going, but

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.520
Loki is going to the Nintendo conference

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.880
and we'll let you know firsthand what happens. But you are not the... you're not going to be

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:28.380
the second person in the world to play the thing either, right? I'll beat people up, but will people...

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:32.360
Well, they're going to be having the black-eyed peace there to, you know, distract people so I can play

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.200
you the console, so... But I'm gonna definitely get to play before E3.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:40.160
Here's the funny thing. Three finalists are gonna be chosen by entries that are

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.900
given on AOL's website,

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:45.800
but only one person is going to be selected once they're all out there to

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.600
actually do it.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.760
Wouldn't that suck to be one of the other two? But they all get to go to E3 anyway, huh?

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.140
What cares? They get to go...

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:56.280
It's... So what? I was the first to play in the world. Whatever. I mean, it's no big deal.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.440
Yeah, get out of my way. I want to play.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:06.760
Well, I guess I wasn't really the first non-Konami employee to play the supernova in the United

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.520
States, so that was kind of cool.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.520
Yeah.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.760
You know, it's just like Final Fantasy XI this week.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.920
I was the first person to get Corsair!

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:18.640
Well, I was the first person to get laid tonight, so, you know.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.320
Is there any quests involved with that?

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.040
Yeah, there's big quests and the whole thing.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.840
So it's like everybody puppet master now?

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.040
Everybody just has to be first!

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.600
Everybody just wants to be first!

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:33.040
It's like I'm looking for a white mage, but all we have is blue mage and corsair and puppet master

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.440
I mean

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.280
I'm sorry. It's just that 360 thing just could have been better

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:48.440
So anyway if you want to enter AOL, I think you have to be on AOL to do it so hope you're there

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:55.440
Anyway, but Rob, how will I ever find a CD to sign up for AOL?

01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:00.440
I don't know, maybe go to AOL.com?

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.440
You have any other release dates for us?

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.440
I slotted us some time to talk about release dates,

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.440
but I don't know if you have your list or whatever.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:07.440
What's coming up this week?

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.440
The Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories moved dates.

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:13.440
It moved to June 6th, and then they dropped the price again to $19.99 retail.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.440
Oh, I'm being corrected by our chatroom.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:19.960
it's not AOL only, it is open to non-AOL members as well.

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.000
GK128 said it first, thank you guys.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.200
I should go sign up for that and see if I can win it.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.640
I know, maybe I should go sign up too.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.100
I just don't want to get AOL crap.

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.240
Well, then again, I already get it.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.800
How worse could it be?

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.560
Because I had AOL for two weeks

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.160
because I bought it for a trip.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.600
Just don't, I don't want to, I feel dirty.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:43.320
You don't leave AOL ever.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:50.320
No, um, but next week, um, or actually I should say this week, um, great stuff coming out.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:55.360
Finally, finally, Advent Children is finally coming out.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.360
Is it finally here?

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.360
Finally.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.960
They're advertising it on TV so you can go pick it up.

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.880
You might even be able to find it in the stores now if you're listening to the podcast because

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.040
people like Breaking Street Date.

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.880
But definitely go check it out if you haven't seen it yet, although you probably have on

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:15.720
the internet, but now's your chance to get a nice English copy of it. Go check it out

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:21.360
now. Also, coming out this week I have Outrun 2006 Coast to Coast, which is going to be

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:31.360
pretty fun. Also Rampage World Tour, Rampage Total Destruction coming out, which isn't really

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:38.240
any different than the last few Rampage games. And then Win Back 2, Project Poseidon is coming

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:43.720
out. Not too much buzz on that but that's still good. Ace Combat Zero, The Belkan War.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:50.460
If you're a, you know, flight sim fan you're gonna love that. And I believe that was all

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:55.780
the big stuff. I was really looking for Grand Theft Auto but they had to move it. Hopefully

01:13:55.780 --> 01:14:01.920
they're either working on multiplayer or fixing multiplayer because their multiplayer sucked.

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.420
god damn lazy programmers

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:06.520
snow wondered that is what's going to take

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:10.100
you know take two down

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:13.240
uh... we're gonna go to a break here pretty soon but first i want to mention the

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.900
chat room you know that whole a l l conversation now they're talking about

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:17.720
other like old school

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.720
networks like uh... compu serve and somebody brought up prodigy i was on

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:25.280
prodigy years ago copy sir prodigy jeannie

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:29.980
jeannie all my god jeannie and then uh... what's the other big one delphi and i

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:32.740
But there's another huge one I'm leaving out that people were saying in the chat

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:33.620
room.

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:36.020
Maybe not CompuServe.

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:39.700
Maybe. If you go all the way back to Commodore 64, there was one that was

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.660
before AOL, because AOL bought them out.

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:46.420
Quark, do you want to say what it was called? I used to freaking go on a bulletin board

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:51.260
which had internet access. BBS's were hardcore. I used to do BBS's like in the Sacramento area

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.960
like hardcore. Grab the

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:56.680
California Computer News, a little free publication that was out there,

01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.140
have the BBS list in the back and you can, you know, find a bunch of stuff on there.

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:04.940
Remember back in the day, you know, those you guys used to call into BBS is

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:07.840
probably if you're more like our age, like in your twenties, although I imagine there's

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.100
some teens that remember this too.

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:13.380
Like, it wasn't about the size of your internet penis,

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:16.900
but it was about how much of the sis-ops

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:32.580

We have the technology. Yes, we have the technology. We can build it.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.360

Two weeks. Oh my god. You're like uber hardcore

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.240
I know I was like it's an I was like after two weeks

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.640
I was like, this is the nerdiest i've ever been in my entire life

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.480
And that's saying quite a bit

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.640
That makes me feel nerdier than usual.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.920
All right.

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:54.360
