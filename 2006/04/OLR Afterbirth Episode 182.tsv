329	1910	who syndicates our show weekly.
1930	4190	We also let them have a crack at this little live segment.
4590	11632	So tonight we thought, okay, we're not going to be having a live show next week because Loki's getting married, right, Loki?
11892	12072	Yes.
12233	12473	All right.
12713	17894	So we thought, and we have a lot of chatters who wants to know, who is Loki getting married to?
18014	20775	So we asked her to sit in for a little bit so we could say hello.
20815	22055	So please say hello to Nellie.
22616	23456	Hi, everybody.
23596	24136	How you doing?
24396	24896	I'm doing good.
25256	27537	So you're getting married to Loki next week, correct?
27878	28679	Sadly enough, yes.
29159	30760	Why do you say sadly enough?
31161	31561	I don't know.
32162	32902	Sadly for him.
33523	33743	Okay.
34043	36385	First thing they wanted to know, are you into video games at all?
37726	37926	No.
38407	38967	No, why not?
39748	41049	Because they're boring.
42590	46574	Do you think they take away from cuddle time or...
47550	52994	No, I have a pretty rigid regime in the house where he can't play him when I'm there.
53074	53615	No, I don't know.
54816	58118	I just, like, I don't understand the fascination.
58538	58919	You don't?
59079	59239	No.
59259	59779	That's right.
59939	61300	I don't even know how to use the buttons.
62961	63662	What are you into?
64763	65283	Porn.
66424	68165	As you've told everybody already.
68205	69246	I was just teasing, though.
69266	70967	You don't have to say that just because I said that.
71007	71768	Are you really into porn?
72250	72871	I guess.
73171	74032	And what kind of porn do you like?
75093	75674	All kinds.
75694	76555	Alright, well that's cool.
77996	78877	Dog porn.
79098	81060	So there's not a single... You don't like dog porn?
82261	85004	She's just trying to make yourself sound freaky because you're marrying her.
85765	87026	How long have you and Matt been together?
87627	89850	It's going to be five years in July.
90510	93634	So what made you choose the 30th for your wedding date of April?
94008	94769	I don't know, random.
95189	96930	Did you just throw a dart at the calendar and that's what you got?
97110	98191	Um, actually, sort of.
98291	101574	I opened the calendar and I pointed my finger and there it was.
101994	102715	How did he propose?
104076	104616	I can't say.
107478	108299	It was that awful.
108839	109239	Okay.
109300	109520	No.
110460	112402	But there was a lack of clothing at the time.
114131	114271	Ew!
114571	116392	Oh God, I gotta wash my brain, I gotta wash my brain.
116412	117973	No, it wasn't that bad, it was very sweet.
118053	119613	I was Loki's roommate at the time.
119893	120453	Yes, you were.
120834	124575	I think you were probably like right outside too, like with your computer.
125475	126036	Doing video games.
126096	127076	Masturbating, I don't know.
127096	127696	Oh, maybe, I don't know.
128857	129297	Let's see.
130257	131618	What else was I going to ask you?
132558	135599	So he's going to E3, like a couple weeks after the wedding.
135619	136359	I know, bastard.
136540	137740	And does that piss you off?
138780	140221	We've come to an agreement about it.
140481	141462	Okay, what's the agreement?
141582	142523	He gets to go to E3.
142603	143764	And he gets me a present.
145025	147306	But what if he brings back a t-shirt?
148227	150048	Then he's going to be in trouble.
150108	153291	No, anything he'll bring me, I will love because I love him.
153331	156173	And he basically lets me have whatever I want anytime I want.
156253	158655	So it's about time I gave something back.
158855	160116	What is it that you see in Loki?
160136	162017	Because a lot of our listeners think he's a dick.
162978	163939	They're fucking dicks.
165896	166557	I'm just kidding.
166897	167957	Everybody loves Loki.
168177	168698	Great.
168718	170739	I'll kick some ass.
170839	172019	Except for the Apple fans.
172699	173900	Do you use computers now?
174780	175681	A computer?
177422	179223	Yeah, I know you're not that big a retard.
179243	182164	She likes those stupid, pretty computers.
182544	184045	Oh my gosh, the Apples.
184125	185345	They're so pretty.
185405	186326	So you like Apples?
186526	187386	Only because they're cute.
188247	189747	I don't need to do anything on it.
190108	193669	I just need to be able to access my email, look up porn, of course.
194350	195030	And that's about it.
195595	202984	Yeah, the first day I had this laptop, I freaking couldn't even work on it at work because I had to go in a conference room to remove the porn that she put on the backdrop.
203064	203985	I'm funny, shut up.
205868	206448	It was great.
206548	212776	It was like this giant vagina and the girl didn't even do a good job waxing because you could see the little hairs growing back.
212816	213417	It was so funny.
215103	216624	Now I got a bleach in my brain.
217104	217624	Oh, God.
217764	220386	This is why we don't podcast this little bonus segment here.
220406	222227	Well, I actually did that during the show.
222807	223287	I know.
223828	227249	The week he got that laptop, the first thing you did was started putting porn on it.
227329	227550	Yes.
227570	229971	Because I was asking if you want a gay porn site so you could use.
229991	231292	I was just trying to save him some time.
234893	236054	What kind of work do you do for a living?
236794	238135	You don't have to tell us where, but what kind of work?
238155	240376	I talk on the phone and yell at dumbasses all day.
240536	240777	Really?
240877	243338	Ever had any really annoying customers you just got to yell at completely?
244184	245404	I don't yell at customers.
245584	249066	I yell at notaries, and every notary is an idiot, pretty much.
250226	250586	I don't know.
250606	251666	I don't have any funny stories.
251706	252867	I should have prepared better.
253007	253387	That's all right.
253427	254987	Well, you came on here last minute.
255007	255527	You're a good sport.
255567	257068	Did you see the shirt we got him last week?
257368	257948	Yes, it's funny.
257988	258548	He wore it to work.
259409	259669	Did he?
259749	260029	Okay.
260749	261089	That's good.
261109	263690	We just want to make sure you weren't going to be offended by it, but I knew you.
264070	264790	Game over.
265531	266811	You know it's totally true.
267391	268011	I know.
269172	269992	He's done for.
271667	273552	The chatroom is saying Loki's whipped.
274173	274614	Is this true?
276038	276359	No.
278442	281445	Hey, sometimes I wish we were a TV show.
281725	283847	Oh, plug my Myspace thing.
283887	287330	It's got a picture of how whipped he is, I guess.
287370	287670	Does it?
287730	290613	Okay, so you're in the top eight on our Myspace, I believe.
290633	290933	Yes, I am.
291413	292194	Didn't we move you in there?
292214	292675	I think we did.
293015	296818	So if you go over to Myspace.com slash Orange Launch Radio, Nellie is in our top eight, I believe.
296838	297659	I believe we put her in there.
297719	298159	I think so.
298480	299320	So check it out.
300121	304205	And they want to know what Loki's shirt in the video you just put up on OLRPSP.com says.
304705	308686	I'm a groom, I'm doomed, show me your hooters Did you see the little buttons, Nelly, too, that we had?
308826	311887	The little bachelor party in progress, the little light-up titties?
329011	329792	Yeah, those are cool.
329852	331333	Those lit up for a really long time.
331413	332554	The next day they were still flashing.
332634	333915	Mine never flashed, ever.
334235	335736	I guess I knew I was gay.
338879	340060	So, who planned the wedding?
340360	340820	You or Loki?
341061	341241	Me.
343733	345795	Oh my god, I should let them plan a wedding.
345835	347556	It'd be like all computer party wedding.
347776	348797	Oh, shut up.
349498	349938	Whatever.
349998	350959	Video games.
351399	353661	You know, I went to a wedding where they had Halo at the reception.
353681	354441	A Halo wedding cake?
354461	356563	Yeah, a Halo wedding cake and a reception with Halo.
356583	357824	Can you guess who that was?
358485	358785	Oh, wait.
359005	359866	A friend of yours.
360046	362448	I don't know.
362488	363308	He's a friend of the show.
364109	364289	Yes.
364769	365550	All right.
365590	365990	We'll tell you.
366010	366851	We'll talk more about it later.
367611	370434	I don't know if there was anything else I was going to ask you.
370454	371795	Is there anything else I should ask her about?
372481	373202	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
395865	400391	My co-worker Idrine, who knows my taste, she got me this video.
400511	403274	It's called, I Walk a Mile to See Some Camel Toe.
403855	408881	And we watched it, and my boss watched it, and so now everybody knows I'm weird.
409042	410403	Oh, can we put that on our website?
410924	411204	What?
411625	412226	The video?
412666	413207	If you want to.
415991	417052	What was I going to say?
417972	422475	Let's see, somebody was saying here, somebody wanted to know your boob size, but you don't have to tell them that.
422775	423395	Or you make it up.
423575	425176	They kind of vary.
425256	430119	If I gain weight, it's a D. If I lose weight, it's a C. Right now, I'm fat, so...
431542	434203	I'm so hot I know, I'm going to bed too I know
453667	455047	I know, Rob's in the wedding.
455087	457848	Don't I have to subject myself to Jewish traditions for the wedding?
457868	458308	Yes, you do.
458328	460209	Because you're a little yarmulke.
460269	460949	Shut up, Matt.
461109	463890	Because you're Jewish, right?
464350	465130	Yeah, I'm a Jew.
465530	466631	Okay, well, that's not a problem.
466651	467731	We have listeners that are Jewish.
467871	468831	I am a Jew gold.
469211	471572	After we're married, I shall show Matt where I stash it.
473252	474613	Oh, you see, you like South Park.
474794	475074	Yeah.
475214	475895	Okay, there you go.
475935	476395	Oh, boy.
476455	477456	Too hot for podcasts.
477476	477836	That's right.
477876	481019	You know, I will only subject myself to such, you know, religious traditions.
481179	483281	Well, one, I've never met a Jewish person I didn't like.
483461	483842	Seriously.
484242	485503	I've never met a Jewish person I didn't like.
486124	487185	I can show you a few.
487345	487585	I know.
487605	489206	I'll probably meet some at the wedding, you know.
489407	489607	Ha!
490027	491609	Yeah.
492069	495912	But, you know, I'm willing to try new and interesting things.
495973	496353	It'll be fun.
497847	499228	Yeah, they're all kosher.
500189	500429	All right.
501050	501410	All right.
501990	502891	We're going to talk about games.
503171	506774	So anything you want to say to our listeners, our hundreds of thousands of listeners, listen to us.
506874	507695	Hi, listeners.
507795	508696	Get a life.
509156	509777	Okay, thank you.
513547	514707	That's Nelly, everybody.
514767	516448	Loki's fiance, the lucky gal.
516468	517789	All right, let's shut the door.
517989	519229	New listeners in chat tonight.
519249	520450	We really appreciate that, you guys.
520470	523431	Thank you so much for tuning in and supporting us.
523851	524751	It must be working.
524791	526212	People must really be telling their friends.
526272	530733	Or maybe it could have been that story, too, that got a little bit of publicity a couple weeks ago.
531033	532154	I wonder if we got anybody through that.
532194	532474	I don't know.
533826	540072	Most people actually probably ignored that.
540292	542914	There was only one site that actually mentioned us.
543395	544316	Well, not really mentioned us.
544356	550321	They mentioned a site that stole the story from another site that stole the story from another site about
551485	552466	The story being correct.
553066	554607	When the whole Castlevania thing came out.
554707	555147	Yeah, that's right.
555447	563031	When the Nintendo Power confirmed the Castlevania thing, nobody said, oh, I guess this proves Orange Lounge Radio's story is true.
563531	568074	But that's how it works, is that people don't care where the news originally came from.
568334	569515	So why stop caring, too?
570731	571312	Well, we'll see.
571992	572293	You know what?
572313	576438	We're going to just make announcements on the air only so that only our listeners get to hear it from now on.
576698	578900	We've done that before and everyone ignores it.
578940	579461	That's true.
580302	580923	Well, who cares?
581023	581884	Our listeners found out.
581924	582645	That's the important thing.
583165	583926	Maybe it was just me.
584046	586429	I don't give a shit about other people.
586509	586709	What?
587070	588411	I seem to have an entourage of newbies.
588451	589192	Maybe it was just me.
589853	590133	I don't know.
590173	590354	Maybe.
591465	592385	Alright, let's go around.
592705	594566	This is the afterbirth portion of the show.
594886	605948	We don't podcast this because, you know, we talk, maybe we talk a little bit about games, but, you know, we talk about us and, you know, what we've been up to and just a way for our fans to connect with us over the past few years.
606748	618411	Because we used to do this show for three hours when it was the Balmani show, but if you actually listened back then, you know it would be about 30 minutes of Balmani and then two and a half hours of, you know, fucking around.
619812	622454	It was a train wreck, but it was THE train wreck.
622475	625638	Yes, it was a train wreck everybody was buying tickets for.
626038	628380	At least, you know, all three of you that listen regularly.
629041	629502	How was your week?
629522	630142	How was your day?
631043	631383	Magus!
632084	633105	Ah, my week, my day.
633646	640032	Well, my week, high point of the week was going down to Dave & Buster's for a very special birthday.
641253	642254	Not mine this time, though.
644119	650363	And a little bit of pet peeve about that, they card everyone who goes in, and me, I'm almost 21, almost.
651004	652825	They card me, I can't get in.
654346	661811	Until, uh, the special birthday guest comes on in, and, uh, says, oh, oh, oh, he's with me.
662671	670957	But, uh, little thing about Dave & Buster, Dave & Buster's is awesome, if you haven't been there, it's, Rob put it best one time as, uh, Chuck E. Cheese for Grown Ups.
671781	674223	Or I also say it's a Las Vegas hotel without gambling.
675243	680767	Well, pseudo-gambling, you have like the, uh... Okay, gambling for children, the tickets thing.
680787	681087	Yeah, tickets.
681107	686911	But you can get all sorts of shit there, and just all the machines they have are just pristine.
689113	698319	Aside from that, I haven't really been doing much lurking game facts a bit, getting some World of Warcraft, trying to get my character up a couple honor ranks.
699560	699660	Um...
702479	704000	What level is your character in WoW?
704500	706621	Currently 56, almost 57.
706821	708382	Orc Rogue on Maelstrom.
708562	709843	That's RP PvP.
709963	711103	Emphasis on RP.
711543	712004	Maelstrom.
712044	713644	I wonder if that's the same one he plays on.
714405	715625	No, but it's not PvP.
715705	716906	His isn't PvP, I don't think.
717426	718347	He plays on Malfurion.
718447	719107	Malfurion, yeah.
719127	719968	Very close name.
720068	720649	It's PVE.
720689	721970	It's one of the newer PVE servers.
722050	724432	He's 60 on Malfurion.
724992	726713	Extifer is what we keep pointing to, my roommate.
727814	729115	But I stopped playing World of Warcraft.
729155	730256	I think my highest character was like 25.
731377	732298	I didn't play very much.
732818	734980	It's kind of sad, and I'm kind of ashamed of it.
735340	743386	I started on Maelstrom on the day Maelstrom was launched, the day RPPVP servers were launched.
743827	744687	I started my character.
744727	745508	I started Kroth.
745548	746289	I started that rogue.
747425	752648	and it's been about six months since the server came out and I'm just now getting to 60.
754169	754409	Wow.
754609	755229	Well, you know what?
755249	756490	That's okay.
757110	758211	Stop and smell the steel bloom.
758291	761613	I played Final Fantasy XI for two years and never got a character to 75.
761693	764434	In fact, my highest level is 55, which is like nothing.
764815	765115	Nothing.
765435	771238	Like right before I quit, I was finally doing Genkai 1, which is the break the limit for 50.
773439	774400	Because I'm a slow player.
775905	778547	But now I'm making better progress the second time around on my new server.
778907	779508	I'm having a good time.
780249	784592	Even though I gave Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 a negative review, I'm still playing it on Xbox 360.
784932	787694	Because I do like getting to sit my fat ass on the couch and play.
787715	790877	I just think a lot of people are really going to be turned off by the whole front end stuff.
791097	792699	And you don't want to feel like you wasted the money on it?
792879	793079	Yeah.
795160	796041	I guess that's part of it too.
796081	797823	I don't want to feel like my money's wasted.
797843	799024	Alright, anything else?
799724	800425	No, that's about it.
800505	801846	Loki, how was your week?
801866	802406	How was your day?
804248	804348	Um...
806084	806704	DarkSakura.com
829794	834295	So, it's just because at the end, you know, everybody's submitting their stuff last minute.
834495	834735	I know.
835015	836675	I hope I get something tomorrow or I'm going to cry.
836935	839376	So, just, yeah, be patient.
840056	852498	I've been doing, like, business cards and stuff, website stuff, and just, I don't know, getting ready for everything.
852718	855479	Finally, I got kind of a surprise.
855759	856519	My coworker
857563	859426	Ironically enough, one I don't like too much.
860107	862811	But apparently she has her good streaks now and then.
862931	864653	She's all, so you're on the A3?
864674	865214	I'm like, yeah.
865735	868078	And she's all, well, um...
869864	871586	DarkSakura and I want to go to that too.
892236	893636	I want to go to Sony, too.
893716	894137	Here's the thing.
894157	894677	Hook me up.
894717	895337	Hook a brother up.
895397	899578	They had a hell of a time getting me in, and they don't have any extra passes.
899658	901559	Otherwise, you know, it would be no problem.
902039	905179	But, you know, probably next year will be a little different story.
905260	911261	So I'm looking forward to it because I cannot wait, you know, to try it, the revolution stuff.
911361	914302	So, yeah, it should be awesome.
917037	920480	My day and my week were okay, as I mentioned before.
920500	926766	I've kind of talked about a lot of it already, because of course I went to DarkSakura's birthday thing yesterday at Dave & Buster's and watched her drink a little bit.
927406	932872	By the way, just so you guys know what I got her for her birthday, I got her a thing of Patron, the tequila she really likes.
933632	935774	It ain't cheap, let me put it that way.
936695	937756	But it's hers.
938257	939978	Let's see, what else did I do?
941940	942440	Thanks for watching!
962725	963185	Scary stuff.
963446	966387	And we just booked our hotel, finally, too.
966848	973132	We're going to be not that far from the E3 Outpost, because we're going to be doing stuff with our buddies over there at allgames.com, which should be fun.
973512	976134	And it is open to the public all but Wednesday night.
976154	982898	I think all the other days it's open to the public, so you can come down to the E3 Outpost, and they're going to be doing games and all that good stuff.
983178	987061	It's basically, it's kind of like a cyber cafe from what I understand, but it's consoles.
987481	988242	and you can rent consoles.
988262	997829	They have like HDTVs and Scott Rubin who used to be with G4TV.com and his buddy Lawrence, they do a show there every day over at AllGames.com.
998050	999551	So they're going to be doing that for E3 as well.
999571	1004054	We're going to be doing something I don't know, with our buddy Bobby who also does a show over there.
1004275	1004715	Should be fun!
1006927	1008609	Um, let's see.
1008649	1009570	Should we get into Cage Match?
1009590	1010651	Do you guys have anything you want to talk about?
1010711	1011432	Anything random?
1011472	1012573	I don't have an agenda for tonight.
1012613	1013834	I didn't come up with anything, so.
1013995	1021282	I've been actually working on that, because, okay, I'm trying to, my stupid laptop, now, granted, I know everyone's like, you don't even got a Mac.
1021502	1023164	No, listen, I want to do stuff with my laptop.
1023584	1029106	So anyways, the whole problem was I found out the reason why my laptop was crashing is because the RAM I had apparently was bad.
1029886	1034107	And so I had a gig stick in here that I bought for $100 or whatever.
1034587	1036808	And I looked at it.
1036828	1038389	I'm like, you know, this already has a gig in it.
1038609	1042910	And upgrading it only to a gig and a half for $100 isn't really a great deal.
1043210	1048712	So I turned around, took that money that I got from the gig stick, bought a minidisc player.
1049412	1054657	for recording audio interviews and wireless mics to go with that.
1054877	1055898	So that's kind of cool.
1056719	1059742	But on top of that, I've been trying to get my computer to network my computer at home.
1059842	1060883	It networks fine with this one.
1061103	1069531	Of course, I just fucked it up about a second ago when I said disable the wireless connection because I was trying to change the network because it wasn't seeing you.
1070091	1072593	But anyways, hopefully now it's working.
1072834	1074475	No, it's not because Windows sucks.
1074535	1075056	Good job!
1077018	1079664	Anyways, my cage match is on the internet and you need to download it.
1081269	1084016	Well, then I guess we should get into tonight's cage match, shouldn't we?
1084617	1085740	So, cue the music.
1088888	1090929	Remember to participate in the cage match.
1090949	1092109	You have to be in chat.
1092329	1094210	www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1094250	1094910	Click on chat.
1094930	1100173	The way the cage match works, since we have some noobs tonight, we're going to play three songs for you guys.
1100193	1103234	You hear a clip of last week's winner and then two new songs.
1103614	1109996	And the winning song goes into our regular rotation over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com all week long until we claim another winner.
1110657	1114098	So starting off tonight, DarkSakura's pick won last week.
1114278	1116339	You guys like the emo song.
1116739	1117921	So it's the winner.
1117961	1120965	It was Adam and Andrew was the artist and it was Emo Kid.
1121466	1123108	And I've seen this on a lot of my spaces.
1123169	1124510	So maybe some of you guys have heard this before.
1124831	1127134	Here is a clip of song number one you can vote for tonight.
1127715	1129938	Adam and Andrew with Emo Kid.
1130759	1132121	Mood apathetic.
1132842	1134424	My life is spiraled outward.
1134804	1138568	I couldn't get enough money to go to the Blood Red Romance and Suffocate Me Dry concert.
1138988	1146955	It sucks cause they play some of my favorite songs like Stab My Heart Because I Love You and Rip Apart My Soul and of course Stabby Rip Stab Stab.
1147476	1150238	And it doesn't help that I couldn't get my hair to that flippy thing either.
1150839	1152360	Like that guy from that band can do.
1153081	1153882	Some days, you know.
1159929	1178295	I'm almost emo enough to start shaving my legs Cause I feel real deep when I'm dressing in drag I call it freedom of expression, let's just call me a fag Cause our dudes look like chicks and our chicks look like dykes Cause emo is one step below transvestite Stop my breathing and slit my throat
1185199	1214743	I must be emo I'm dark and sensitive with low self-esteem The way I dress makes every day feel like Halloween I have no real problems but I like to make believe I stole my sister's mascara, now I'm grounded for a week Sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies I can't get through a Hawthorne Heights album without sobbing Girls keep breaking up with me It's never any fun, they say they already have a pussy They don't need another one Stop my breathing and slit my throat I must be emo I don't jump around when I go to shows
1216201	1231192	I must be emo, dyeing my hair and polish on my toes I must be emo, I play guitar and write suicide notes I must be emo My life is just a black abyss, you know?
1231393	1240960	It's so dark, and it's suffocating me Grabbing a hold of me and tightening its grip Tighter than a pair of my little sister's jeans Which look great on me, by the way
1245774	1248175	All right, that was song number one tonight's cage match.
1248235	1250796	Last week's winner, Adam and Andrew with Emo Kid.
1251256	1253337	A nice long two-minute clip for you guys.
1253397	1254537	Will it win tonight?
1255198	1260860	It's up to you guys in chat, but you can't vote until all three songs have played.
1260900	1263641	And the second song tonight is my pick, Me, Me, Me.
1264201	1269403	And I picked a song by a band that I like, a little trancy band called Phragma.
1270203	1274685	And the song I picked tonight is called Radio Waves, which I think is appropriate.
1275485	1282270	and I just downloaded some random trance compilation and this was on it and I figured you guys needed a good trancy song.
1282330	1284932	So here it is, Pragma, Radio Wave, song number two.
1284992	1285212	Enjoy.
1340472	1365823	There's no way back, but I still see you I'm searching through, forgotten airspace And through white noise, you reach out to me You reach out to me
1375706	1391523	Radio waves through the empty mind Radio waves through the lows and highs Radio waves keeps the flame alive
1487029	1487831	Thanks for watching!
1494605	1497667	Song number two was by Fragma tonight, Radio Waves.
1497687	1499728	Let's go around and see what our studio thought of that.
1500008	1502249	Remember, our opinions are just that, opinions.
1502309	1503770	It's your votes that make the decision.
1504910	1505551	Andrew, what do you think?
1505871	1509072	I like good chopped up type of beat.
1509773	1510553	It doesn't get boring.
1510693	1512654	Good synth, really meaty bass.
1512694	1519538	I could have used a little more kick to it in some of the higher regions, but really good, really trance-y little tune.
1520178	1520878	Really good for ambi.
1520918	1521519	I'd give it a nine.
1522219	1523480	That was a really comprehensive review.
1523540	1526062	Usually we get people in here and just go, sucked, three.
1528304	1528645	Good job.
1529185	1530826	Loki, okay, seven.
1532047	1532268	See?
1532408	1532828	See what I mean?
1532848	1533709	Look at what that asshole did.
1534570	1535811	Me, I like it.
1535871	1540715	I think the only problem I have with it is it gets a little quiet in the middle part, and I'm like, ooh, I'm going to fall asleep, and then, oh, shit, I just woke up.
1540735	1541876	Like I said, could have used a little more kick.
1541976	1542336	Exactly.
1542356	1543737	Could have used a little more kick in the butt in the middle.
1544518	1545459	Needs more cowbell.
1545479	1547260	Yes, more cowbell would have done good in the middle.
1547320	1547621	Viva.
1549059	1549600	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1567279	1568600	All right, Loki, what'd you pick tonight?
1571301	1576323	I picked a song, a remix of a song that we actually won Cage Match.
1576543	1580304	Yeah, butch, by the way, it's been in the Cage Match about four times now under different remixes.
1581004	1582245	No, it has not.
1582405	1585046	Listen, it has not been under in different remixes.
1585086	1587247	It's only been under the Cage Match once.
1588407	1589248	One time.
1591168	1595070	This is a remix of Pendulum, Hold Your Color.
1595730	1598852	This is the bipolar mix, and it's actually quite different than the original.
1598872	1599472	How appropriate.
1599732	1603034	We have a bipolar song and an emo song in tonight's cage match.
1603694	1604634	Gotta love OLR.
1604694	1605155	It's good.
1605835	1608836	Trust me, it's off their single, so it's pretty cool.
1608916	1609697	Alright, here it is.
1609737	1610417	You be the judge.
1610537	1614679	Chatroom, song number three, Hold Your Color, the bipolar mix by Pendulum.
1614699	1615059	Enjoy.
1863615	1867638	Song number three in tonight's cage match, Pendulum, Hold Your Color.
1868098	1869099	Don't hold your votes, though.
1869119	1870220	What do you think, Andrew?
1870420	1870841	I liked it.
1870861	1873383	It kind of had the kick that Rob's song kind of lacked.
1873863	1875324	It was like they couldn't decide on a tempo.
1875344	1877466	It went from mellow to upbeat to fucking hyper.
1878627	1879227	I like it.
1879587	1883030	I'll give it a 9.5, half point off, because, Loki, you're a goddamn cheater.
1883050	1885192	We love that about Loki.
1885272	1886593	Amen to that, Loki.
1886953	1887914	It's a remix.
1888094	1889055	Goddamn cheater.
1889095	1889495	What's your vote?
1889515	1890616	Completely different song.
1892062	1894109	At least it wasn't like the last one I picked.
1894712	1896699	I give it a 10 because I've been listening to the song.
1896719	1897120	I love it.
1898174	1903477	I must be emo, I'm dark, insensitive, but low self-esteem The way I dress makes every day feel like Halloween
1924350	1928094	And song number two you can vote for tonight, Fragma with Radio Waves.
1935741	1939805	And song number three you can vote for tonight, Pendulum, Hold Your Color, Bipolar Mix.
1947978	1950400	Place vote now.
1950501	1953604	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
1953644	1954725	Do it now, now, now, now, now.
1954945	1956547	Punch the keys for God's sake.
1961112	1961532	What, Loki?
1961552	1961812	What are you?
1961972	1962133	What?
1962153	1963013	Okay.
1963134	1965156	I don't see you make disgusting faces often.
1965636	1967098	It takes a lot to shock Loki.
1968550	1971592	They announced another game that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
1972453	1972773	Uno.
1973354	1973634	What?
1973854	1974554	That's cool.
1974755	1975215	I'm sorry.
1975275	1975955	I like Uno.
1976035	1976476	Screw you.
1976516	1977216	Screw that.
1977537	1978858	That's a fucking chatroom game.
1978898	1980018	That's not an Xbox game.
1980058	1980539	Fuck Uno.
1980659	1983561	You know what card game needs to come to Xbox Live.
1983601	1985963	And if you know this game, I love you.
1986003	1987504	So I'm waiting for the chatroom to shout it out.
1987624	1988505	It better be bullshit.
1988605	1989005	Come on.
1989165	1989365	Come on.
1989405	1990066	Not bullshit.
1990086	1990326	Come on.
1990486	1990726	Milborn
2006570	2018836	It's a French card game, and you're like a car, and you gotta go a thousand miles, and you have the stop sign, or the red light, green light, and then you can puncture people's tires.
2019376	2023358	It's all a card game, and I'll tell you what, it's one of my favorite card games I remember from when I was a kid.
2024318	2025479	I swear to God I'm not crazy.
2025539	2026219	Stop leaving me like that.
2026279	2027840	Somebody in chat room has got to know what I'm talking about.
2027860	2028080	Screw that.
2028100	2029020	I'll just play speed.
2029080	2031161	There was a computer version of it not that long ago.
2031281	2032542	I need to find that again.
2033042	2037264	Maybe one of our listeners knows of like an abandonware site or something where I can find this because they had a collection.
2037304	2043287	It had Rakko and Milbourne and there was another one.
2043947	2045368	What was that other really popular one?
2046228	2049630	Phase 12 I think is one of them.
2050590	2053515	I think there's another one, though, that's really popular.
2053555	2055037	It's like a gin rummy thing.
2055117	2056278	Okay, I'm looking at chat now.
2056939	2058541	Okay, some people know what I'm talking about there.
2059242	2060765	See, some people have it there.
2062126	2064570	Okay, well, tell us more about Uno on Xbox.
2065972	2067554	Well, I've got actual screenshots of it.
2068831	2073594	Apparently Xbox Oxide or whatever, Xboxide, whatever.
2074655	2081219	Their website, they have not only that, they have pictures of MotoGP 2006 gameplay.
2081239	2082880	Apparently they were sent some debug ones.
2083280	2088184	But for our in-studio guests, there's a picture of it.
2088564	2089585	That looks cool!
2089685	2090225	Impressive.
2090485	2091006	I know.
2091026	2093307	And you actually get to play it against other players online.
2093567	2094368	That's cool.
2094448	2095809	How can you say that that looks bad?
2096349	2097330	You're a bad man, Loki.
2097350	2097690	I know.
2098571	2102554	I don't know.
2102574	2103375	It doesn't say.
2104075	2107298	They just have a debug version of it right now on live.
2110607	2112648	Phase 10 says Color of Sakura.
2112668	2115329	That was the thing I was trying to think of earlier.
2115429	2117910	They are showing some of the achievements.
2118370	2122792	Uno, Bluff, Multiplayer, Quick Change Artist, Wild Abandoned, and Ace.
2123012	2123952	I don't know what the hell those are.
2124473	2126353	So for you achievement point whores, have fun.
2126674	2128674	Ooh, Color of Sakura linked me to a Millborn game.
2128774	2129935	That's funny.
2130055	2132156	This is not the same one I'm thinking of, but this will work.
2132816	2134056	You can change the rules.
2134236	2135637	That's kind of neat.
2135717	2136177	I don't know.
2136217	2137478	I guess I'd play this.
2139058	2141659	All the horsepower they have in that system, they're using it to play card games.
2142639	2143059	Kind of a waste.
2143079	2145080	This is just the Xbox Live Arcade stuff.
2145200	2145740	Alright, alright.
2145800	2146821	Fair enough.
2148641	2150762	More power to them for putting games on there.
2150802	2153403	Yeah, Xbox Live Arcade is supposed to be for shitty little games.
2153743	2154843	But there's some good stuff in there.
2154963	2159565	I want some damn Monopoly or Scrabble on Xbox Live Arcade.
2159765	2160105	Here, here.
2161496	2163618	I want old game shows turned into Xbox Live arcades.
2163638	2165599	I want Match Game on Xbox Live.
2167080	2168801	Remote Control on Xbox Live.
2168981	2170082	Remote Control!
2170502	2171023	Hell yeah.
2174184	2177986	These shots of... Charum wants a link to what you're looking at, Loki.
2178006	2179526	They're getting foamy at the moment.
2179546	2180427	Buy links now.
2180907	2184068	Okay, it's XboxSide.com.
2184108	2186069	They actually also have PlaySide.com.
2186169	2186690	Same type of thing.
2186950	2188911	It's basically a site that has a bunch of media on it.
2189711	2191172	So I will give you the link to the site.
2191212	2191732	Bookmark it.
2191832	2192852	It's a really good read.
2192992	2197014	You can watch some videos of stuff that you might not even see in other places.
2199235	2199595	Anyways.
2200136	2200636	Do-do-do.
2202025	2204307	DarkResurrection.com
2219295	2219735	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2248334	2248955	I'm done, ready to go.
2277133	2278494	I don't give them much time anymore to vote.
2278514	2279155	You gotta vote quick.
2279555	2281176	Alright, it was very, very close.
2281276	2284999	Only one vote determined the winner, but in the end, there could be only one.
2285039	2287641	And it was... Hold Your Color!
2290904	2293886	Which goes to show me that you all support goddamn cheating.
2294567	2294927	Good job.
2295247	2295567	Whatever.
2296676	2299678	Oh, Color of Sakura linked me to another Millborn PC game.
2299958	2303461	The one I'm thinking of had other card games in it.
2303581	2304782	It wasn't just Millborn.
2304802	2310626	It was like the official Millborn game, and it had Racco, and see, this is another Shareware one.
2310846	2312827	Good, a good start, but not the same one I'm thinking of.
2312867	2317230	It had Racco in, I think, Phase 10, and there's some other game.
2317270	2318071	I just can't think of the name.
2320069	2322373	Alright.
2322473	2325218	We're about ready to get into the chatroom FUs of the week.
2325259	2327863	I'm just waiting to get a few, so they're open.
2328044	2330688	If you want to send in your FUs of the week, send those over private message.
2332113	2333673	Meantime, what was the chatroom talking about earlier?
2333714	2334494	Clerks 2, right?
2334534	2335514	When's that movie supposed to come out?
2335794	2336374	I don't remember.
2336694	2337655	Soon, I know that.
2338635	2341016	I have to admit, I'm not that excited about it.
2341056	2347198	I love Kevin Smith movies, don't get me wrong, except I didn't really, like Jersey Girl was kind of whatever, but I understand why that movie was made.
2347678	2354500	But I don't know, my excitement for this movie hasn't been that as great as it should be.
2354580	2355940	Is that a sign that I'm turning 30 soon?
2355980	2356040	No.
2358018	2358999	I'm starting to wonder.
2359379	2361301	I'm no longer an angsty 20-something.
2361682	2362382	August 18th.
2362703	2363684	I'll go see it.
2363764	2364585	I'll see it too.
2364645	2365005	I will.
2365125	2368268	I've watched every single Kevin Smith film, good or bad.
2368689	2371211	And I did watch Jersey Girl and I didn't like Jersey Girl.
2371291	2371972	But you know what?
2372092	2373433	I sat through it and watched it.
2373594	2377177	And I will go see this because I love the Clerks movie.
2377297	2379379	I love the Clerks cartoon.
2379439	2380661	More the cartoon than the movie.
2380681	2381281	Oh, yes.
2382202	2383483	I think it could be still funny.
2383643	2389146	I'm just worried that they're going to try to pull it off like... You know, Jane Silent Bob Strike Back, not so good.
2389226	2393288	I mean, it was an okay movie, but it just wasn't as good as... edgy as Clerks.
2393348	2394608	It wasn't, you know, smart.
2395369	2396569	Just kind of dumb humor.
2396930	2397310	But, um...
2398519	2402003	I'm all for the Clerks animated movie, which is supposed to be coming out after Clerks 2.
2402083	2403344	That's the next thing he's working on.
2404065	2405086	Clerks, Clerks, Clerks.
2421457	2424541	I see another network going this way, and it's really sad.
2424902	2429067	Cartoon Network is putting reruns of Saved by the Bell on there.
2429087	2429868	No, that's awesome.
2429968	2430469	You shut up.
2430529	2436057	That's awesome, because they showed Jesse's song on Thursday night, which, by the way, is the episode that is...
2436497	2437838	I'm so excited!
2438198	2439298	I'm so excited!
2439459	2439779	I'm so excited!
2460689	2460869	Got you.
2460889	2461109	Got you.
2477148	2480933	GK128 says there's a rumor that Cartoon is actually trying to produce new Saved by the Bell episodes.
2480953	2481053	What?
2481073	2482355	Like Saved by the Bell the newer class.
2496218	2500001	Year 3 or Year... Get Elizabeth Berkley back.
2500041	2500962	What the hell's she done?
2501443	2503164	And Lark Voorhees.
2503544	2504745	What the hell happened to her?
2505146	2506307	No love for Lark.
2506387	2510430	Unless it takes place in the 80s, fuck it.
2510891	2512872	I don't want a modernized Saved by the Bell.
2513313	2513833	I don't want it.
2514293	2515174	I lived through that.
2515314	2515915	I don't want it.
2518064	2528334	I think they should make Saved by the Bell edgy like what was that one show that was on Fox for a while that had to deal with the faculty and stuff.
2528574	2530035	I don't remember what the hell it was called now.
2530356	2530816	Teachers?
2531257	2535761	Tiger Claw says what Cartoon Network needs is to put that old 80s Chuck Norris cartoon on.
2536161	2536922	Oh, hell yes.
2537462	2541907	Color of Sakura says they need to bring back Freakazoid, which met with much cheers in the chat room.
2543208	2546190	Freakazoid movie, live action, Jim Carrey playing the lead.
2546230	2547872	That would be the coolest shit ever.
2549153	2553456	SSJ100, Matt says Adult Swim should stop putting full house and putting fucking clerks on there.
2553476	2554897	They have full house on Adult Swim?
2554978	2555658	How rude.
2555698	2556279	The fuck?
2557179	2557800	Is that for real?
2558260	2558721	I don't think so.
2558921	2559521	Better not be.
2559561	2562564	I only heard of, um, just save at the bell.
2563328	2563829	Interesting.
2564229	2565050	But how long is it going to last?
2565070	2566452	Are they really going to have that for a long time?
2566472	2567413	That seems like one of those things.
2570397	2572921	They're airing all the big episodes.
2573001	2574883	They're not airing everything I don't think.
2575836	2576156	I don't know.
2576576	2579378	Because Jesse's song had the music video in it too.
2580258	2581199	It's a great episode.
2581219	2582800	It's quality television.
2582900	2583780	I T-voted it.
2583900	2584500	I swear to God.
2584821	2592604	If they want to play something at like 3 in the morning that's like, you know, just like the 80s live action TV show hour, that's fine.
2592644	2593385	They can do that.
2593505	2596566	But don't go with G4's doing this.
2596606	2597147	Ha, ha.
2597807	2601469	Ichiban Crush says in chat, Saved by the Bell is only going to be on Adult Swim for two weeks.
2602492	2603192	Okay, well, that's cool.
2603412	2608734	Then they can see they're airing all the memorable episodes, and then they can go to a different crappy 80s show.
2608794	2609674	I think that's cool.
2610214	2610634	I'm sorry.
2610895	2611815	Okay, that's fine, then.
2612195	2615556	But the whole thing is I don't like what they're doing in G4.
2616496	2619077	I'm just like, who the hell is directing?
2619097	2620978	I mean, seriously, someone needs to go.
2620998	2626519	Okay, yeah, G4 is supposed to be TV about games.
2626939	2628080	Please explain how...
2628840	2631844	Fastlane, Star Trek, Brainiac,
2636010	2637171	They sidestepped it.
2637231	2637932	They sidestepped it.
2637952	2639533	It's not TV about games.
2639553	2641155	It's TV for gamers.
2641375	2643077	Yeah, and it's not really games.
2643137	2645359	They've kind of admitted it's not really about games anymore.
2645419	2647000	Not all gamers watch Star Trek.
2647040	2647621	Most of us do.
2647641	2652966	Plus, didn't you see the press release this week that they hired Howard Stern's girlfriend to be the new host of Filter?
2653226	2654347	I thought that show failed.
2654407	2655748	It wasn't because of the host.
2655768	2657410	They're bringing it back, and it's not about gaming topics.
2657790	2661514	And they're going to be – Icons is now no longer – It wasn't about gaming topics when it was –
2662094	2664195	Icons is no longer going to be about gaming topics.
2664235	2665455	It's going to be about J.J.
2665615	2668616	Abrams and who's the guy that did X-Men?
2668656	2670436	Bryan Singer and all that stuff.
2671036	2672817	And what was the other thing?
2674277	2676378	Something about Attack of the Show being retooled.
2677878	2679498	They're adding another co-host to it.
2679959	2682299	Yeah, who is not even a game type person.
2682939	2684480	Well, most of them weren't anyway.
2685160	2685380	Anyway.
2686057	2687318	I'm still pissed when I ate up Tech TV.
2713157	2714818	I'm still sore over that.
2715719	2723125	That's why we like getting to work with Scott Rubin as limited as we do because we get to work with someone who jumped ship before it all went downhill.
2723966	2725447	That's how we know he's a smart man.
2725507	2730991	He got off that sinking ship before it hit rock bottom.
2731011	2732272	I don't get it.
2734881	2736822	Alright, I'm a gamer and I don't get it.
2736982	2738263	Let's get to FUs, okay?
2738363	2739604	We're gonna get to the chatroom FUs.
2739624	2740744	We have a lot of them, so here we go.
2741044	2745006	Tonight's FU music is being provided by Kid Whatever, who was on the show earlier tonight.
2745167	2745787	Dun dun dun.
2746347	2753151	Alright, um... Shaoran says FU to Girl Scouts for selling amazing cookies at such a high price.
2753611	2755752	I don't have no big monies to buy no fancy cookies.
2756553	2759754	FU to my computer for turning off at random moments for no good reason.
2760335	2763797	FU to myself for only just finishing my huge project for school.
2764813	2769395	Laser123454321 says, F you to Sky.
2770796	2771716	There's your shirt.
2771796	2772837	Where's my era?
2772917	2774097	Good, cool, fat mix.
2775818	2777659	I think I remember something.
2777739	2779159	It's something from the Rob Roberts show.
2779319	2780480	I have to check out this link.
2780800	2784782	I'm supposed to send them an MP3, and I haven't.
2784822	2785862	My bad, Laser.
2785922	2786423	I'm sorry.
2787943	2788383	I know.
2789464	2790324	Let's check this out here.
2790344	2790544	Control-V.
2796855	2798957	In which Rob gets completely whipped by his fans.
2800379	2802541	I can't get the link to come up, how sad am I?
2804663	2805344	Copy?
2805364	2812411	Hey, dap you to my computer for causing the- okay there we go, finally, let's see this.
2812971	2814253	Who's in control here?
2815897	2817618	Oh, it's the shirt.
2818238	2818878	This is what I want.
2818938	2823619	I said I want somebody to design a shirt that says, I figured out how to quit you.
2823739	2824980	Bye.
2825360	2827320	In the western font, like Brokeback Mountain.
2827340	2827780	And there it is.
2827860	2828861	I figured out how to quit you.
2828941	2829201	Bye.
2829761	2830501	Oh, God.
2831341	2832742	You know, I wish I knew how to quit you.
2835287	2836829	I'm gonna send that idea over to Busted Teaser.
2837409	2838170	I'll tap four, bitch.
2838230	2838891	I'll tap four.
2839271	2841634	Laser posted in the chat.
2841674	2845198	DidYouLoseASock says, What was song number two that lost by one vote?
2845738	2846920	It was the Emo Kid song.
2847020	2848181	And then the other one was only two votes.
2848201	2848421	Fine.
2849562	2855429	F you to Nintendo of America for not bringing Mother 3 stateside, but tip of the hat to Nintendo of Japan for actually making the game.
2855909	2857630	If you lose a sock, don't lose hope yet.
2857730	2861953	If it's not announced at E3, then get angsty, okay?
2862113	2865074	Gizm says, F you to Oblivion for taking up all my time.
2865835	2867035	You're on my Xbox Live friends list.
2867055	2868436	You are always on that damn game.
2869357	2872798	GK128, of course I'm always on Final Fantasy XI.
2872818	2879742	GK128 says, F you Natsume for taking three shitty This Gen Harvest Moon games to finally release one awesome one in Magical Melody.
2880082	2880703	What, Natsume?
2881003	2882064	Make another Lufia.
2882104	2882604	We want it.
2883070	2887818	Andy THPS says, F you to Korean online games for their insane XP curves.
2888560	2896433	The Ichiban Crush says, F you to that shitty Famicom game I had to review for LostLevel.org, which made me lose my love for Puyo Puyo.
2897421	2899383	DanceCook says, F you to my friend Andy.
2899744	2902907	He talked me into playing Strip Advanced Wars with him and I lost horribly.
2903087	2903508	That's hot.
2904128	2907512	Also, F you to the book Pulp because the ending made me really emo.
2907933	2910315	By the way, I wasn't mad when you called me DanceCook earlier.
2910355	2911977	Well good, because I just called you that again.
2912658	2918605	PhoenixRising says, F you to having to work so hard to level in MMOs and the overratedness of World of Warcraft.
2919185	2922828	Phoenix Rising would also like to say F you to Sony for opposing homebrew so much.
2923309	2924130	I will gank you.
2924390	2931756	ColorofSakura says F you to DreamLineOut for canceling their appearance at Bomani Fest 2006 and making Tokyo Game Action look bad.
2932317	2933178	I didn't know that.
2933998	2934799	That sucks.
2935460	2940184	That was like their big draw was that Mr. T, oh my gosh, that sucks.
2940524	2941705	Oh, yeah, the whole Tokyo game.

3166438	3169321	Just like everything else in the gay circle, I'm always the last to know.
3169341	3180009	I think they had this whole high school college demonstration where people would be silent for a few hours and I don't know what the hell it was supposed to signify, but it was supposed to be some sort of gay rights thing.
3180590	3180890	Okay.
3180950	3181691	I don't get it either.
3182491	3183052	I don't get it.
3183232	3184353	That's not being gay.
3184653	3186575	Most gay people I know are fucking loud.
3188316	3189017	You're telling me.
3191127	3192568	I only can make fun because I am gay.
3193809	3194209	Whatever.

3205575	3207196	So it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
3207456	3208277	Loki, your final thought.
3209037	3210798	I have lots of work to do this week.
3211519	3213700	And I don't know if I'll see you.
3213940	3214801	Oh, God.
3214861	3216762	There's one story I forgot.
3217918	3218579	H2V2.ggl.com H2V2.ggl.com
3247779	3249021	Yeah, Ryoma clarified here.
3249241	3252827	They were ignoring people because gays were being ignored or something like that.
3254229	3255612	When I'm around, I can't be ignored.
3255772	3256874	How hard is it to ignore?
3257795	3258897	Andrew, your final thought.
3261080	3261681	I have fury.
3263548	3268189	My final thought is time for me to go play more Final Fantasy XI.
3268990	3269270	Addict.
3270530	3271270	Shut up, you're not Jamie.
3272030	3273231	Okay, okay, I'm a WoW addict.
3273251	3273991	I have no room to talk.
3274111	3278052	Remember, kids, no live show next week, but tune into the podcast stream.
3278652	3281073	When you next hear Loki, he will be a married man.
3281733	3282173	Sucker.
3283553	3287234	And I will be the only unmarried OLR host.
3288575	3288975	How sad.
3290293	3293855	And since, you know, with laws being the way they are, I won't be getting married for a while.
3294275	3295276	Wah, wah, wah.
3295416	3297377	Unless I move to Massachusetts.
3297897	3298638	Oh well, who cares.
3298938	3300079	Oh well, you're not a sucker, right?
3300299	3302080	Hey, it just gives me the right to be bitter.
3303040	3305642	So when I'm especially bitter on the show, I can just go, hey, it's because I'm not married.
3309604	3310325	Have a good one, everybody.
3310805	3312947	We'll see you next time.
3312967	3313807	Stay tuned to the podcast stream.
3313827	3314668	Two weeks, by the way.
3314788	3315748	Big announcement on the show.
3316209	3317229	In fact, maybe before that.
3317270	3319971	Stay tuned to the website around May 1st-ish.
3320071	3320592	Right, Loki?
3322193	3322433	Yes.
3322593	3323534	We'll tell you this much.
3324314	3327637	We're launching a new website, and it's a PSP thing.
3328557	3328757	Yes.
3328877	3329598	And that's all we'll say.
3329978	3330178	Yes.
3330479	3335062	And if you love OLRPSP.com, you're going to love it.
3335282	3335822	So stay tuned.
3336082	3336263	Yes.
3336463	3336703	All right.
3337984	3338984	Have a super day, everybody.
3339004	3339745	We'll talk to you later.
3340365	3343346	And thanks for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting Internet Radio.
3343466	3347068	Please reconnect to the stream in about 15 seconds to resume... Oh, shit!
3347088	3349029	I almost forgot the fortune cookie message of the day.
3350009	3350349	Shit!
3350990	3353191	It's because DarkSakura's not here to give me the death stare.
3354451	3357953	Here it is, your fortune cookie message of the day, which I almost forgot.
3358113	3358493	Damn me.
3359173	3360614	This is a special moment right now.
3360654	3366356	We'd like to take this time to tell all the kids at home, send your parents out of the room.
3366376	3367197	This is a kid's song.
3369175	3379187	Life's gonna suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up Life's gonna suck when you grow up, it sucks pretty bad right now Hey, if you know the words, sing along!
3379427	3388378	You're gonna have to mow the lawn, do the dishes, make your bed You're gonna have to go to school until you're seventeen It's gonna seem about three times as long as that
3394622	3396085	Hey cheer up kids, it gets a lot worse!
3399923	3424506	You're gonna have to deal with stress, deal with stress, deal with stress You're gonna be a giant mess when you get back from the war Santa Claus does not exist and there's no Easter Bunny You'll find out when you grow up that Drake Bird isn't funny Life's gonna suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up Life's gonna suck when you grow up, it sucks pretty bad right now
3426067	3434530	You're gonna end up smoking crack On your back, face the back You're gonna end up hooked on smack And then you're gonna die And then you're gonna die
3453578	3455479	DarkSakura is a damn dirty cheater too.
3455740	3457921	That song was just in like four weeks ago, I think.
3459443	3459703	Oh well.
3460463	3460744	Oh well.
3461804	3463065	No, it was in last week's pre-show.
3463105	3467208	That's why it sounds like it was in last week's pre-show, but it wasn't Fortune Cookie not that long ago.
3467609	3469470	The moral of the story is, it pays to cheat.
3469490	3472312	You know what, that's one of my favorite Fortune Cookie messages anyway, so I don't care.
3472893	3475014	I'll play that every week if you kids don't shut up.
3477416	3477877	Just kidding.
3478237	3478577	Love ya.
3479258	3483401	Have a great night, everybody, and reconnect to the stream in about 15 seconds for more Orange Lounge Radio.
