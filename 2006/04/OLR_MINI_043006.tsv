79021	80463	We're taping on Saturday this week.
81084	84528	So not joining us tonight is the chat room and the Skype line.
84588	85248	It's just us.
85449	85889	Oh, darn.
86149	88272	So we're not calling this an official episode.
88312	89633	This is a mini episode.
90674	91816	I like episode-let.
92515	93435	A little episode let?
93556	94196	I like that name too.
94216	95496	We'll call it an episode let.
95997	96217	Yeah.
96357	96917	Like a nugget.
97597	98778	Yes, a little episode let.
98798	99858	That's kind of gross.
100679	102519	It's a nugget poop.
103340	106681	So this is our little episode let for this April 29, 2006.
107221	110283	There will be no Part B this week, so please don't be looking for it.
110583	112143	We're only going to do about half a show tonight.
112464	115665	It's been kind of a slow news week too, all things considered.
115785	116785	I guarantee you Wednesday.
117086	117726	Where's Part B?
118346	121487	I'll put up a picture of a face sticking out a tongue and go, there's your Part B.
142614	142994	Allgames.com 630-ish
164918	166079	I may find John Cena again this year in Stockholm.
183100	184161	I didn't know he was an E3 attendee.
184182	184963	He was there last year.
185023	186285	He's a wrestler.
186305	188388	Are you going to stalk celebrities, C-list celebrities?
188649	190492	I might bump into a few more celebrities.
190572	191013	Who knows?
191153	195480	I bumped into Kojima the year before and I bumped into Miyamoto last year and this is literal.
195714	195994	E3 Outpost.com
225799	226780	Who doesn't want to meet us?
255649	256369	or a dollar.
257069	261051	Alright, let's cut the crap and get to how our gaming week was.
261151	262491	DarkSakura.
263271	264452	Bye everybody!
265992	267453	Oh, I guess that's it for the show.
269073	271054	How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
271114	275455	I played a buttload of Ragnarok yesterday and I played a buttload of Ragnarok today.
275875	279997	Instead of doing the rest of my homework today, I played a buttload of Ragnarok.
280777	281777	I'm so responsible.
282698	283978	The thing is that it was due two weeks ago.
286444	301648	No, I tried to play some Kingdom Hearts last weekend because I wasn't here last week because one of my really good friends and a listener of ours, DisneyPunk10, came up to hang out for my birthday week, which was drunken.
304949	305549	More drunken.
306330	306870	Good times.
306930	309130	I talked about Dave and Buster's on last week's show.
309150	309671	It was good times.
310611	314732	I actually did not get as insanely drunk this year as I did the year before because now I'm grown up.
316896	319499	You'll never be a grown-up.
319539	320500	You still play games.
320960	321841	Games are for kids.
322502	322963	Hey!
325505	326386	Obviously, I'm joking.
326867	327928	I wasn't playing with my dolls.
330111	333955	Yeah, oh, you know, though, I found out a piece of... Oh, yeah, I saw Silent Hill three times.
335063	336503	I went on last Friday.
336764	338064	Oh, we didn't get to hear your feedback on the movie.
338124	338904	Obviously, you liked it.
339284	339604	Oh, yeah.
340505	344166	I went Friday, and then I went again Sunday, and then I went Wednesday, and I drugged Julie with me.
344486	345866	Is it possible to see a movie too much?
346066	346187	No.
346867	361671	I'm going to go again, hopefully, before we go to E3, and I think I'm going to see it while I'm at E3, because one of the DDR Freak moderators is from South America, and he hasn't... It's not opening there for a while, so we're going to probably bring him to see it at some point.
361851	362252	That's cool.
363052	363232	But...
364725	367306	I forgot.
367746	368446	Oh yeah, Silent Hill.
369106	370307	Oh my god, Red Pyramid.
371227	372487	I was like, you could kill me.
373207	373828	I'd die happy.
374828	378809	I like that they actually got an actual actor to play him in The Janitor.
379309	383150	Because he moves so fluidly.
383770	386191	It's just like, oh yeah, I could watch that for hours.
386869	393190	Somebody at the, I was out at the club last night and some of us were talking about Silent Hill the movie and somebody called him Triangle Head.
393490	394350	That made me laugh.
394370	396371	Triangle Man.
396431	398871	That's exactly where my mind went to.
398891	403512	This is how we know we're both dorks because my mind went exactly, Triangle Man, Triangle Man.
404192	406933	And if you catch that reference, you too, my friend, are a dork.
406953	412794	There actually is a LiveJournal icon where it had Pyramid Head as Triangle Man.
413579	418343	and what was the guy in the second game, James, as Person Man.
419864	421746	Alright, games, gaming week.
421766	423047	Okay, yeah.
423607	429452	I hit level 43 for my job class, which means I have seven more stupid job levels to go.
429572	431113	Or that you are a certified dork.
431694	437038	Hey, I'm not the one who was on... This is your gaming week, not my gaming week.
437138	437438	Okay.
439060	439640	Drama!
440581	440741	No.
441542	442923	This is definitely an off night for us
444302	452705	Um, but yeah, and then I, um, I, uh, worked on, uh, something I'm doing for Kingdom Hearts fan art opportunity with a friend.
453605	456186	So, uh, I've actually been sort of artsy gamey.
457127	462608	Sort of trying to get back into my old, uh, you know, nerd hobbies, but school is sort of kicking my ass.
462989	465049	But I think I'm doing a flashlight based off a video game.
465089	467990	I'm just not sure if I'm going to do Silent Hill like I've done all my other homework.
468811	470311	Um, I might just do something.
470331	472272	How about a Guardian Legend tribute page in Flash?
472292	472772	That would rock.
473411	477795	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
490276	491576	Who wants to do my flash homework for me?
491836	492196	Not me.
492716	495877	My gaming week, I played Final Fantasy XI a little bit.
496817	497857	Actually, more than a little bit.
497877	499338	I played a lot.
500478	502858	Like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI.
502898	504498	So I'm kind of like on a little mini break.
504838	506259	I'm taking a little mini vacation from it.
507359	514800	But otherwise, the only really new game I played was Project Gotham Racing 3, which isn't really a new game because it was an Xbox 360 launch title.
515120	516160	But Loki let me borrow it.
516540	519001	And so it's about like the 50th racing game I've played on the 360.
520251	521191	Download the Speed Pack.
521511	523472	I forgot to mention Dan downloaded the Speed Pack.
523852	524652	Doesn't that cost points?
525593	528253	Yeah, however, the cars that are in it are so worth it.
528353	529994	One of them is the Evo 8MR.
530774	531234	Maybe.
531334	531654	I don't know.
531975	533515	I don't know how I feel about this game still.
533535	534995	I like the game.
535036	535776	I think it's pretty.
536236	540837	I think it's got a great interface, and I think it's a very fluid interface, and it's great to get into.
541237	548760	But the racing itself, I found you have to use different tactics in this game than you do in other types of games like Ridge Racer, and that kind of threw me at first.
548820	549740	It depends on your car, too.
550520	553823	I understand why it's not a game about drifting.
553883	556065	It's more of a street race type thing.
556145	557326	It's just a different style.
557915	560217	I had to read up on GameFAQs how to do a frickin' turn right in that game.
560237	563380	My suggestion is actually to do the in-car view when you're playing.
563400	564962	It actually does make a difference.
582746	583207	You know what?
583267	586889	Maybe I get a little motion sick sometimes, too, because that view makes me all weird.
586909	588310	The interiors, though, are perfect.
588670	588930	I know.
588970	589550	It's pretty looking.
589570	593453	I did notice a flaw, being that I'm a Lancer freak, since I drive a Lancer.
594073	598996	They did the interior for the Evo IX inside the Evo VIII MR. Wow, that's nerdy.
599236	599796	That is nerdy.
600437	603759	Pretty awesome you know that, though, because I would never have noticed that.
603779	606060	I like that you can test drive all the cars, though, even the expensive ones.
606080	607321	I'm not a car person.
607509	610310	You can go to the expensive ones and do the test drive so you can see how they play.
611190	613690	It's a fun game and I will probably play more of it.
613730	616231	I just was a little like, whoa, this is a little bit different.
616291	619211	But I love that it's so fluid.
619251	620952	It is definitely one of the better racing games on 360.
622092	626713	I was kind of surprised because I didn't think it would be the type of game I'd like, but I really enjoyed it.
626773	635455	But for all these people that like to loop racing games in one big pile and call them all just like racing games, you know, like they're all the same.
636075	637135	You need to play this
637987	643552	Then play something with guns like Full Auto or Burnout, something where destruction is the main factor.
644012	649957	And then play something like, well I know Initial D is not on 360, but maybe something like Ridge Racer where it's more about drifting.
650557	653580	And you'll see the big differences between these racing games.
653800	657803	I would have to loop the Project Gotham series in with the Gran Turismo series.
657844	659205	They play similarly.
660326	663008	More on the realistic side of car motion than...
663550	667113	I have yet to purchase that, I feel that I don't need it My brain is 50 million years old
689096	690397	No, that's a bad, you want to get it down.
690737	690837	One.
690977	692717	You want your brain age 20 is the lowest you can go.
693338	693958	I'm 21 now.
694278	694998	I'm 21 now.
695318	695899	I'm working on it.
697279	698439	How about some gaming news?
699980	701641	Big news in the gaming industry.
701901	705102	Huge, huge news in the gaming industry this week.
706104	706704	from Sony.
707004	716048	Sony has upgraded their PSP firmware to 2.70 to include Flash support.
717088	718809	However, I hear it sucks.
719609	722370	I hear the Flash support really stinks on this.
723070	725511	Did they say what Flash supports?
725731	726471	Is it Flash 8?
727512	732874	No, they just say the release notes say now you can play Macromedia Flash content.
732894	733494	But here's the thing.
733855	736115	You're not really supposed to save the content.
736135	737776	You can't play content that was saved.
738056	740177	Although supposedly people have found a way around that.
740217	741758	You access it from your browser.
741998	746800	But there's no way to launch just... Let's say you want to download Homestar Runner movies and watch them at your convenience.
747040	747700	You can't really do that.
748180	749021	It doesn't really work that way.
750001	751622	And they say that Flash games...
752222	756004	Run, like I was reading web forums, Flash games run like two frames a second, like they're horrible.
756505	760307	So, the Flash support is there, but needs a little bit of improvement.
760507	761347	I can work around that.
761627	762128	Yeah, we'll see.
762628	764769	Who knows, we might be seeing our own content in Flash.
765150	768231	Possibly, although I don't know, we may want to wait until this gets better.
768451	771593	Because from what I'm hearing, the feedback, not worth the upgrade.
771873	774635	The feedback I'm hearing on the forums is this is not worth the upgrade right now.
775427	776267	I wouldn't mind testing it.
776368	778589	I really would not mind designing something and testing it out.
778609	780650	Well, you still have my PSP, so I guess you could do that.
780710	781090	Yes, I do.
781230	782671	It will be coming with us to E3.
782791	783131	All right.
783672	784132	Sounds good.
784152	787454	Yeah, there's plenty of reasons why everybody should bring their PSPs to E3.
787794	790475	My husband still has not got me my PSP.
791176	791396	Really?
791736	793017	Because I think we're getting a camcorder.
793557	795418	Well, you need to get a PSP out of that, too.
796677	800519	Let's see what else has been added in the PSP 2.7 upgrade.
801240	807503	UMD video L and R button has been added because you can disable the channel skip feature with the L and R buttons.
807663	809304	And I've done this before.
809324	811825	It's too easy to accidentally knock those buttons or hit them.
812185	813606	So you can disable that.
814727	821330	And AAC is now playable on the PSP as well, which is a very popular iTunes and Apple codec.
821370	822311	So that's pretty cool.
823257	827441	So if you want to check that out, all you have to do is just on your PSP you can update the firmware.
827501	837310	Keep in mind, for those of you guys that like to do controversial things on your PSP which involve downgrading your firmware, 2.7 will lock all that out because obviously they fixed all those loopholes.
837370	839732	So something to consider before you do this.
840063	842645	Where one loophole closes, another one opens
867502	895085	but I would say perhaps I think there's actually truth in this I think maybe they will keep quiet about the price I think they just want to show the goods and I think this whole blu-ray kind of factor will probably determine I mean because we still really don't know like is are the games going to be blu-ray I mean they say it is is it movies I mean are we still I mean certainly websites out there are talking about one way or the other but we still really don't know what Sony's plan really is for that
895545	898649	So I think until that's been established, it's really hard to get the price.
898729	899570	So we'll see.
900411	901572	I mean, I could be wrong.
901793	909722	I'd like them to release the price, and I'm pretty sure it's going to be $399 to be competitive with Xbox 360, even though rumor is they're going to drop price.
910183	910423	But...
910982	912743	I don't think we'll know for sure until the end of summer.
912783	913864	It seems fair.
914284	918787	That was pretty much as much as the PS2 was released for when it came out.
919028	921329	And wasn't the PlayStation 1 about that much when it came out, too?
921589	922070	Maybe at least $2.99.
922130	924151	No, yeah, it was around $2.99.
924952	930315	If I do remember correctly, because I didn't have one, I was there when someone bought one, because it lived in my dorm room.
931236	931916	He didn't have a TV.
933157	937200	But, well, the price of a dollar has gone, you know, different directions since then, so...
938277	945061	Alright, one other thing that we can expect on Sony is a very popular franchise's sequel, correct?
945561	946061	Luminous 2.
947202	947542	Awesome.
947682	954766	Sounds like there was a mention into this video.
955887	961650	They were saying that it's probably going to be officially revealed at E3.
962030	965672	They made a mention of Luminous 2 is coming out, so maybe we'll see that at E3.
966667	966887	New music!
996848	1002333	Special Art New Unlockable Content Free Porn It'll be Luminous with Sony characters
1019652	1024816	Other huge, huge, huge news in the gaming industry this week from Microsoft.
1025357	1029320	And Microsoft has said that they are going to be previewing E3.
1029340	1030461	Well, actually, they haven't said this.
1030481	1031261	This is just a rumor.
1031882	1038247	But you know Microsoft's going to show Halo 3 because they've got to derail the thunder from whatever Sony's going to bring, whatever Nintendo's going to bring.
1038427	1039668	They've got to derail the thunder.
1039728	1043551	So Halo 3, they are saying, is going to be previewed at the conference this
1043991	1045733	Rumor has it it's a two minute video.
1045993	1047214	Nothing playable yet, kids.
1047294	1047594	Sorry.
1047974	1054900	But a video will still be enough to kind of get that, just get that cravens in for Halo.
1054920	1062346	Make sure that you bring Kleenex to wipe the drool that the fanboys are going to be having over the game.
1062987	1063547	Absolutely.
1064188	1064748	So check that out.
1064768	1066209	That's going to be a good one at E3.
1067883	1071966	Jamie, another franchise with a sequel that could be shown at E3.
1072367	1073607	This is some pretty cool news.
1073908	1079332	Looks like Red Octane and Harmonix are looking for indie musicians to put their stuff in Guitar Hero 2.
1080232	1092541	There is a contest at BeAGuitarHero.com so musicians can send in their own hard rock, heavy metal stuff that features a lead guitar as an mp3 format.
1094474	1096215	Over the Internet for them to review.
1097055	1105319	Guitar Hero 2 was announced actually this month, saying there'd be new play modes, new track list, 40 licensed, 15 unlockable, independent.
1106279	1108360	And of course, Gibson's got support in this one again.
1110081	1114323	But I think that the contest is really neat because we were introduced to a lot more.
1115123	1119745	I would say there's actually more bands local to, I guess, this whole area.
1120605	1123947	But it introduced people to a lot more bands.
1124674	1125275	The Hidden Track
1144281	1144982	That's true.
1145082	1146943	I remember reading something about that, that there's a hidden track.
1146963	1149606	It was actually posted up on our website.
1149966	1154750	And, you know, I just had a brain fart and forgot the name of it.
1155250	1157452	But it's Triple something.
1158173	1159074	It's another indie band.
1159114	1163537	It's not a song that I recognized as a classic rock song.
1163617	1165839	It sounds more like progressive rock.
1166880	1168401	Yeah, it was put up on Kotaku.
1168501	1169442	There's a video there.
1170923	1172125	The song is called...
1175325	1175825	Oh, poo.
1176026	1177666	Now, it's not something you can access, though.
1177967	1179067	You have to use code.
1179147	1181489	Well, not like up, up, down, down, left, right code.
1181509	1183010	You have to use like a... Triplet.
1183330	1183610	Yeah.
1183730	1184751	Triplet's the name of the song.
1185051	1185151	Oh.
1185171	1188012	You have to use a... What's a code thing on PlayStation called?
1188493	1190374	CodeShark, GameShark, CodeBreaker, whatever.
1190414	1190874	One of those things.
1191014	1192015	Pro Action Replay.
1192235	1192515	Okay.
1192695	1197178	But I did... Even though the video is not the greatest, this song is freaking hard.
1197918	1201920	There's no way I'd ever be able to play that one, but it's an expert level song.
1202020	1202881	Why'd they take it out, I wonder?
1203769	1204410	Guitar Hero Guitar Hero
1221088	1221668	Thanks for watching!
1244642	1251849	Moving on to more news about the PSP, LocoRoco has a demo that's downloadable in Japan.
1252430	1257094	So you can check that out at www.jp.playstation.com.
1257875	1259917	Now you actually have to navigate a little ways to get there.
1260277	1260917	Thank you for watching!
1278595	1279015	DarkSakura.com
1308340	1318879	and then their first DS game Panzer Tactics DS which is World War 2 again turn-based strategy Pacific Storm which is sort of turn-based and real-time
1320600	1322221	Then again, it's more World War II.
1322261	1325182	It sounds like they're sort of stuck in the 1940s there for a bit.
1326223	1329404	Also, there will be Heroes of Annihilated Empires.
1330665	1335066	The open beta has actually just launched for that one.
1335227	1342069	And Dark Star 1, which is a sci-fi action game about a pilot trying to solve a mystery.
1343150	1343330	Hmm.
1344045	1344645	Sounds pretty cool.
1344945	1347226	I mean, I'll definitely look up, you know, anything.
1347627	1351929	I mean, I personally am not into the strategy games, but I love anything historical.
1352469	1354290	So I always go buy some of those.
1354590	1359152	Even if I don't care about the game itself, I go to look and see how accurate are they.
1359212	1360052	You know, look at the demos.
1360072	1360873	I think that's pretty cool.
1361573	1361773	Cool.
1362233	1363554	I like games that teach you something.
1364454	1368196	Yeah, and it kind of reminds me of, you really got a kick out of that story a while back.
1368216	1370317	Remember the MMO that had the crucified guy?
1370357	1372418	Yeah, the Roman Empire one.
1372438	1372838	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1374278	1374958	Well, guess what?
1375659	1379321	There's going to be a Marvel Action RPG that makes me happy!
1379661	1379962	Awesome.
1381002	1387706	It actually says it's going to have more than the standard X-Men franchise that we typically see as of late.
1388407	1391829	Activision and Raven are going to put this out on damn near everything.
1392409	1395251	So, I'm sure if you've got the system, it'll play it.
1395691	1397573	You know, short of like the PC Engine or something.
1397593	1398173	Yeah.
1398965	1401868	So it's going to be called Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
1402628	1408073	It will be out actually on the next gen and current gen ones, including the handheld PC.
1408714	1415260	More than 20 playable Marvel characters with Spider-Man, Wolverine, Blade, Captain America, supposed to be out in the fall.
1417324	1424687	Basically, it's supposed to be the usual, you know, not just the fate of the Earth, but the entire Marvel Universe thing.
1424747	1425887	Choose your own adventure.
1426587	1429529	Oh no, I pushed the red button, the world explodes type of thing.
1430809	1432310	It's got a new combat system.
1432350	1434390	You have air combat ground underwater.
1434991	1439152	You have power charging melee weapons.
1439732	1440253	You have...
1441753	1447417	Not only are you going to be able to choose your characters, you actually will make your team of different Marvel characters.
1447557	1450279	You will have different things to represent them.
1450299	1453001	It's supposed to be really customizable.
1453101	1458765	It's as far as your actions actually determine how the game goes.
1460086	1462788	I think sort of fable in that respect.
1464109	1468372	And of course, I have the release dates for this month.
1470034	1470374	Actually...
1471189	1471550	Gugu Gugu Nugget
1488433	1502963	me and my Katamari on the 5th coming out on PSP Metroid Prime Hunters on the DS, Samco Museum 50th Anniversary on the GameCube Pac-Man World 3 on the various collection of random systems Rainbow Islands Revolution I thought that would make you happy
1504801	1512007	Maybe I'm from the DS Well, no, because I thought that you liked Bubble Bobble Rainbow Islands It's just like that, for real?
1512188	1532025	I think it is Oh my gosh, okay, now I am excited Well, it's just because I knew that you were a big Bubble Bobble fan Yeah, I didn't realize it would be the same thing, that's cool Yeah, I'm actually just pulling this up on Eurogamer And it is Bubble Bobble Rainbow Islands Very cool Yeah, see, I love Rainbow Islands, that was a great game
1533398	1546788	We have Rogue Galaxy on the PS2 and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter Coming out They actually get Brain Age on the 19th It's fun Check out last week's show if you want my review
1548258	1554643	Coming back stateside, not a whole lot shaking up the industry this week as far as release dates go.
1555343	1558426	Probably because of the upcoming E3, there's not a very big calendar.
1559046	1560167	Probably until we get into June.
1560487	1562589	However, there are a couple games to look out for.
1562669	1566352	PlayStation 2 has Gallop Racer 2006 on May 2nd.
1568553	1571576	Xbox 360 doesn't really have anything coming until the end of this month.
1571836	1576300	The next big release scheduled is Rockstar Games Table Tennis on May 22nd.
1577304	1579045	Game Boy Advance, Dr. Sudoku, if you really want it, May 1st.
1598752	1604334	Does that mean you're going to have the really hard part where you have to, you know, feel your... It is for real Top Gun based on the old movie.
1604715	1605455	If you can believe it.
1605895	1607896	Actually, I'm thinking of the old Top Gun Nintendo game.
1608656	1610237	That game pissed me off so much.
1610577	1611598	Because I could never land.
1611618	1612078	I'd crash.
1612298	1614399	I wonder how similar it is to the old NES one.
1614659	1615479	I might have to check that out.
1615519	1619741	I haven't seen really the only... We need more games, I think, that played like that.
1619801	1620641	Like After Burner.
1620681	1621662	We need a new After Burner.
1623042	1625043	Except I think I'm going to get the Stegages.
1625143	1626424	Well, you got a new Outrun, so you never know.
1627020	1628301	Actually, we did pick up Outrun 2006.
1628461	1629381	How was it?
1629941	1631242	It actually is pretty cool.
1632363	1636925	I was making pizza the other day, and Dan's like, my girlfriend keeps getting pissed off at me.
1636945	1641687	I was like, yeah, and your wife's going to get pissed off at you if you keep screaming about it.
1643708	1644408	I thought it was pretty cool.
1644428	1651072	He showed me the little demo mode, and it played with a remix of Magical Sound Shower, which made me all happy because that's my favorite Outrun song.
1654785	1659147	Moving on to a follow-up story, but this is a follow-up of something like months old.
1659167	1662427	I think we talked about this, and I don't even know if we talked about it on a podcast.
1662447	1663688	It might have been on one of our live shows.
1663888	1666949	I wouldn't call it a following-up as much as a, oh, we caught up to it.
1667349	1667829	Kinda.
1668169	1674331	Well, this is the thing, is that there was an article in the Mercury, I believe it was the San Jose Mercury News that published this.
1675411	1676251	It was in the...
1678212	1678272	E.A.
1678292	1678873	Spouse Erin Hoffman
1696685	1718026	and her husband was Leander Hasty and he was working on Battle for Middle Earth for Electronic Arts and she's the one that posted the story and he is not working at EA anymore obviously, he's a game designer over at Playable Productions and kind of interesting, I guess what happened is that he was part of this class action lawsuit about the unpaid overtime against EA, so...
1719183	1721725	Then they took their story public, finally, so, very interesting.
1721945	1728430	While the legal proceedings are going on, they actually advise not to go public with identity or any type of information because it could hurt the case.
1729330	1734574	I'm not sure, I have to be honest, I can't remember if it was settled already or not.
1735474	1745181	I think at the time that we read the article, they were actually in the... Right, right, right, no, definitely at the time the article first came out, it wasn't, so...
1747067	1748728	I'm trying to read over it real quick here.
1748748	1768158	Well, I know from having friends who have sued the facilities that they work for, they're advised not to have any contact with, that is if they've left the company, not to have any contact with anybody who still works there and not to really reveal the details going on until after it's been settled.
1769999	1772340	So I would think that that's been why it's so long getting that name out.
1774441	1775662	Well, there you have it, a little follow-up.
1776428	1776648	Grr, argh
1808044	1812374	Well, I wouldn't say this is so much of an FU as it was an almost FU.
1812394	1815602	Because this was really the only thing that's got me at all frustrated this week.
1816103	1817165	Is on my way here...
1818377	1825001	I'm driving along in my lane and some guy in a truck decides that he wants to be in my lane and that he'll conveniently not see me.
1825101	1828883	So he's pulling into my lane and I'm beeping like, you, move on!
1829143	1829884	Stay out of my lane!
1829924	1830644	I'm driving here!
1831404	1845392	And so he ends up... I slow way down, you know, but I can't really brake because there's this car right behind me so I'm slowing way down to try to get behind this guy and he ends up just swinging on in and smacking the front side of my car.
1846193	1846333	And...
1847432	1855713	I actually had started to steer away at that point, you know, so I was all, you know, he knocked my window in, my rearview mirror just pulled inside, rolled down my window, popped it back out.
1856534	1864335	And he eventually, like, you know, hours later, pulls over, you know, and I was like, dude, you are giving me your registration right now.
1864975	1867095	And he gets this look on his face like, oh, shit.
1867876	1874057	So, because, you know, anyone who messes with my car gets the wrath of Sakura brought down upon them.
1875477	1876177	I love my car.
1878104	1894160	I love my car a whole lot so I'm looking at the side of the car and there's oil all over the side and I'm like oh god oh god oh god so I took out my little hand wipes and start wiping the oil off to see what the damage looks like there's no damage my car is fine
1895197	1896078	I go look at his car.
1896378	1897219	His truck is fine.
1897239	1899801	I was like, dude, you are so lucky your car's filthy.
1900361	1901102	And he's like, what?
1901122	1903083	I was like, put your registration back in your car.
1903123	1903604	I don't need it.
1903804	1904585	You didn't hurt my car.
1904625	1906286	Your car's so greasy, my car slid right off it.
1907367	1912271	And I showed him, and he's like, whoa, your car doesn't look like it's damaged at all.
1912291	1913332	I was like, it's not.
1913352	1917495	I was like, I didn't really care if, you know, maybe reverse damage had been done.
1917515	1918796	He was like, don't worry about it.
1918816	1919296	Just go on.
1919316	1919917	He was like, okay.
1921218	1921298	F.U.
1921318	1922499	to A Lack of Sleep
1951016	1952116	I can step on your foot for you.
1952176	1952776	No, thank you.
1953457	1953877	F you, Jamie.
1955017	1955777	F you right back, Rob.
1957258	1960598	I haven't been getting a lot of sleep this week, so F you to that.
1961358	1962019	Oh, I know.
1962399	1963059	I got a good one.
1963699	1966120	F you to the fact that I am traveling to L.A.
1966240	1973481	next week for my day job, so I'm flying down there and coming back Friday, and then I drive back down on Monday for E3.
1974302	1975322	We'll have a caravan, though.
1975642	1977542	Which I still don't have my confirmation for, either.
1977602	1979123	My emails are being ignored at this point.
1979663	1980423	Isn't that interesting?
1981451	1982952	I feel like you should follow my advice.
1982972	1985974	Yeah, let's see.
1986014	1988395	Maybe I'll have to be reporting from the front door because they won't let me in.
1988996	1989336	We'll see.
1990717	1994379	However, you're in and Matt's in, but me, no love for Rob.
1995880	1996400	I see how it is.
1996580	1997441	We'll give you a taser.
1998015	2005381	Well, I'll just have to hack things like my DS because apparently you can hack your DS like you can make it look like a DS Lite.
2005821	2012687	I mean, you can't obviously make the shell of it look like a DS Lite, but you can make the screen a lot brighter like a DS Lite.
2012987	2014268	There is some hacks.
2014568	2018632	It's a hacked firmware that you can put out there and get on there.
2018812	2026518	And it actually was a story that originally broke over on the forums over at gbadev.com.
2028039	2032483	So it actually came originally from a Spanish board is where this came from.
2032583	2033904	So kind of interesting.
2033924	2036567	And there's pictures that prove it that show that it got brighter.
2036647	2039189	So if you're interested in that, check that out.
2039469	2042272	I remember when the Afterburner came out on the GBA.
2043953	2046615	I still have a GBA with an Afterburner.
2046815	2050439	I have the Afterburner in my GBA except I loaned my GBA out to a friend who was gameless.
2051019	2052200	My GBA is pink.
2053101	2054382	Mine is virginal white.
2055720	2057661	I actually own a pink video game system.
2057841	2060323	That's my one requisite girly thing.
2060343	2060803	There you go.
2061283	2062524	By the way, just a quick follow-up.
2062564	2065466	So if you're writing emails right now, you can cut that out.
2065486	2068267	I did find the quick follow-up there to the EA spouse story.
2069188	2073190	There were indeed, those lawsuits were indeed already settled.
2073230	2078353	It was actually three class action lawsuits and it was already, or they actually weren't settled.
2079834	2084196	No, they won settlements in three class action lawsuits the developers did.
2084477	2084957	So there it is.
2085979	2087141	I love when the little man wins.
2090845	2091165	Alright.
2092567	2098975	DarkSakura is not going to be reading any mail but she does have a few words of advice for those of you guys that want to send in mail for next week's show.
2100275	2101797	Yeah, send more of it.
2103358	2107402	I understand I've got three weeks worth of email that's come through.
2108563	2114427	I've replied to as many of them as I could within the limited scope of my homework beating me over the head with a sledgehammer.
2115649	2116890	But I'm going to start fresh.
2116930	2120873	I promise I will read emails regularly.
2121601	2121901	and so on.
2147723	2151268	We really want to hear your opinions and your thoughts on things.
2151288	2152289	That's what we're really after.
2152549	2160098	Also, make sure that if you have an email address that any way remotely resembles anything spam,
2161207	2166829	When you send us an email in the subject line, make sure you put OLR and then your subject.
2167430	2174993	That way, even if it comes into the spam folder, I at least see that we have OLR in the title and I can check it.
2177134	2180095	Anything that has a spam thing on it, I instantly delete it.
2180175	2180595	I'm sorry.
2181876	2185357	I check the email for us at various locations.
2185957	2189999	I do not want to run the risk of infecting systems that are not my property.
2190635	2192297	If I infect my own system, I can fix it.
2192317	2193398	Maybe you should be doing work at work.
2194800	2196161	I never said I was at work.
2196261	2197362	I'm just teasing you.
2197783	2199445	I'm a good girl and I do my job.
2201227	2202928	Alright, guess what?
2205431	2208054	Koei has revealed their E3 lineup.
2208662	2213384	and in that lineup, Guitar Man Live is coming to the PSP in America.
2213444	2214825	That's going to be shown at E3.
2214885	2215725	I love Koei.
2216486	2218347	Exciting news indeed, don't you think?
2218707	2219407	I love Koei.
2219707	2220768	I know, I love them too.
2220788	2226551	Koei is another one of my favorite companies that not many people think of.
2226891	2228031	I'm very happy to hear that.
2228191	2230553	Now they'll just bring us another KO Flying Squadron.
2230753	2231513	Oh yeah, I'll be happy.
2231753	2233694	Well, I'm trying to remember the other stuff they have coming to E3.
2233714	2236575	They also announced some other things that are supposed to be coming to E3.
2236675	2237536	Dynasty Warriors.
2239232	2240674	Yeah, they're doing Dynasty Warriors.
2240874	2241094	Okay.
2242315	2249764	All right, well then let's go over now to DarkSakura to talk about how she likes to surf the internet, you know, sometimes when she's at work.
2249804	2250545	Not at work.
2250785	2252327	Sometimes when she's at friends' houses.
2252827	2257032	And she finds great websites to share with you guys in her website of the week.
2259134	2260776	I actually didn't find this one on my own.
2261755	2271822	This one was given to us in the middle of my Flash class, and I figured Flash pisses me off so much, I'm sure we have many other listeners who are just as pissed off by Flash as I am.
2272362	2274984	It does not, by the way, piss me off as much as Illustrator does.
2275664	2278726	So, this site is called Actionscript.org.
2279447	2285651	For anyone who has to deal with a lot of in-depth Flash stuff, by now you are familiar with how frustrating working with scripts can be.
2286592	2288293	Programming in your Stop Here program
2288732	2291294	Play, and then stop on frame, kiss my butt.
2291434	2294537	So, this is the perfect site.
2294617	2306987	Not only does it have tutorials on how to set up a lot of your different flash actions, also outlined from beginning to advanced level, it has your actual scripts that you need to make all this stuff work, and working examples.
2307908	2311471	Some of these are also listed with movie files to go along with them to show you how to do it.
2311912	2312112	Cool.
2313076	2313577	Very cool site.
2313597	2319761	Not only that, it's also available in, I believe, Japanese, Dutch, French, Russian, and Serbian.
2322322	2324644	For anybody that needs those Serbian tools.
2324684	2327165	Yeah, sometimes you need to read your sites in Serbian.
2327806	2328126	Who knows?
2328206	2329767	It could be from that area of the world.
2329807	2330227	That's right.
2331128	2333229	You provide a world-class service to our listeners.
2333269	2333870	Appreciate it.
2333990	2334530	Of course I do.
2338067	2341388	Moving on, we got one last story for you guys tonight.
2341428	2342848	Unless you have any last minute stories.
2342888	2343449	I don't have anything.
2343469	2344169	Do you have any last minute stories?
2344189	2346389	Nothing video game related, but this is just nerd happy.
2346609	2347009	Okay, what?
2347470	2352671	I found out that the movie theater at Arden Fair Mall is playing Spaceballs next week.
2352771	2354772	They do cult movies every Thursday.
2354812	2356212	They're playing Spaceballs.
2356912	2358113	We need Spaceballs the game.
2358193	2361173	I kind of want to go to that, except I'm going to be out of town, which makes me sad.
2361513	2363954	I'm going to Fandango my tickets.
2364794	2367015	I will dance the Fandango with my credit card.
2367560	2368201	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2381812	2382713	I love Indiana Jones.
2406651	2412316	Make sense because there's supposedly an Indiana Jones movie new one coming on the way too.
2412496	2414398	Harrison Ford is too old for this stuff.
2414458	2417560	Yes, but Sean Connery is rumored to be reprising his role, which might be cool.
2417580	2418902	I love Sean Connery.
2419042	2420083	I know, who doesn't love Sean Connery?
2420103	2423425	He could be a quadruple amputee and he would still be hot.
2423445	2423946	Alright.
2425527	2428370	Well, I think that's about all the stories this week.
2428750	2430051	Yeah, I can't think of anything else.
2430111	2432673	I can't really think of anything else either, so I guess that's it.
2432993	2433594	We're done with the show.
2434034	2434555	So, um...
2435293	2435994	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2458311	2459992	I guess that's going to do it for another week of Orange Sounds Radio.
2460012	2465134	Thank you so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Radio even on weeks when we're not fully staffed.
2465555	2466395	Really appreciate it.
2466815	2467896	We love you guys.
2468016	2470677	Don't forget to check out our big preview show next week for E3.
2471438	2475460	And don't forget to come by the E3 outpost and check that out as well.
2475700	2477321	Remember, chocolate and a dollar.
2478261	2478901	It's important.
2479442	2481983	Oh, by the way, I forgot.
2482763	2485145	Nintendo renamed their revolution to the Wii.
2485665	2486765	Oh my god, Wii!
2487226	2487746	See you next week!
2490652	2493213	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2493413	2496234	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
2496774	2506137	For more information on our live and podcast programs, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next week!
2512499	2515660	Alright, kill the music, kill the music, kill the music.
2515961	2517141	Whee!
2518781	2519442	Whee!
2519462	2520042	Okay, look.
2521670	2522250	Thank you for watching!
2542697	2543318	Avoid the emo part.
2543338	2543778	I should have...
2568544	2569064	Dear Gaming Community,
2594364	2607715	They could have called it the Nintendo Poopmonger, and as long as there's a sexy Zelda game on it, or an innovative Mario title, or some kawaii Animal Crossing game, or hopefully a new innovative franchise, y'all will be anxious to play it.
2608216	2612980	Remember, Nintendo is not after your business so much this time, and while yes, I agree,
2613280	2614822	They need it to be successful.
2615322	2620767	Remember the fact stated above that you'll play a good game regardless of the name of the system it's on.
2621088	2629255	This whole Wii thing is highly symbolic of the push Nintendo is trying to make to break the gamer stereotypes and get this thing playable by anyone.
2629696	2633980	It's a weird name, but honestly, you had to expect something like this from Nintendo, hmm?
2634360	2636022	Let's wait and see how good the games are.
2636582	2636963	P.S.
2638043	2641704	Yes, you can say Wii is stupid because come play with my Wii Wii, haha.
2642024	2645185	It's just as easy to make fun of a sex box or a gay station.
2645745	2647526	Potty brains can ruin anything.
2647846	2648746	Trust me, I know.
2649827	2650367	You know what?
2650407	2657449	When I first saw it, though, if there hadn't been a pronunciation guide with it, I was thinking, well, maybe they... Why?
2657629	2664771	I was thinking, well, I was thinking why because that actually would make sense in my head because why is like yay in Japanese.
2665678	2673123	WAI, I thought that if they were going to spell it, it would be Y, but we... I'd be like, it's cute, it's Y!
2673583	2674984	You know, I get what they're doing.
2675185	2676686	I don't hate the name so much.
2676706	2678207	Oh, we had the Pico, remember?
2678267	2679087	But that was for kids.
2679247	2685051	It's weird, yeah, but Nintendo isn't... You know, Nintendo's trying to reach a broad audience.
2685091	2689834	They want that buzzword, that easy word this time, because they're not trying to reach just gamers.
2689874	2690555	They want everybody.
2690875	2693297	They want Oprah to come out and talk about her Wii.
2694678	2694838	Wii!
2695842	2697523	I've been calling it the Nintendo Wii.
2698323	2702284	And, you know, all those potty jokes and things, Nintendo, I think, hopes to transcend that.
2702684	2709566	By, if they can get the name Wii out there, then, you know, I'm going to go home and play with my Wii is not going to have the same connotation that it does today.
2709926	2712187	If Nintendo can get over that, then they've been truly successful.
2712227	2713187	If they can't, they're doomed.
2713587	2719749	We've actually been having a bit of discussion about this on one of the moderator boards I'm on about how
2721334	2722455	It's just been back and forth.
2722555	2726737	We've all decided, though, that they had to have been on heroin when they came up with the name.
2728898	2730059	I don't think so.
2730819	2740824	It seems like something, to me, and I'm speculating here, it seems like something that kind of Nintendo Japan probably came up with, and America, once they kind of gave their reasons, America was like, okay, we could do that.
2741525	2745066	And I realize everybody's like, why didn't you just keep the revolution?
2745607	2747047	Why didn't you just keep the revolution?
2747067	2747648	Yeah.
2748513	2752816	Do you know how difficult that might be to pronounce for some people outside the US?
2753336	2755138	You might as well call it the Nintendo Prell.
2755538	2758960	Some of you guys will get that joke.
2759320	2762783	I think they wanted something very simplistic.
2763043	2764504	That's the whole thing they're going for.
2764724	2767906	Revolution also has a negative context in some places.
2767966	2770028	Take the game Dance Dance Revolution.
2770348	2773470	They don't call it that in Europe because of the term revolution.
2773530	2773830	I don't know.
2773850	2774831	Somebody gets offended by it.
2775392	2790731	they call it Dancing Stage which is a completely different name so I think Revolution wouldn't have worked worldwide and I don't think there's been a console that's changed their name from country to country in a while I mean yes we had Famicom, NES, Megadrive, Genesis but you know in the past
2791195	2792075	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2821680	2823261	Remember, we had the Pico.
2823681	2825662	We had a system named After Food.
2826322	2832365	I mean, if you're seriously not going to buy this because you don't want a Wii in your house... I don't mind having a Wii in my house.
2832405	2838968	Then Nintendo would make the following suggestions to you based on a recent rebuttal argument that was made on some websites out there.
2839288	2840829	Don't fly Virgin Atlantic.
2841389	2842930	Don't drink naked juice.
2843510	2846912	Don't go to Yahoo or Google because those are all silly names too.
2849504	2850364	I get it.
2850644	2851325	I get what Nintendo's doing.
2851365	2859429	In the world of advertising, being that that's part of what I am in school, you have to do something that's going to be easily memorable.
2860529	2865572	Something that people are going to talk about and is immediately catching.
2866612	2868573	Well, we've got all three of that already.
2869093	2870794	How can you forget Wii?
2871194	2873175	And then everybody is talking about it because, oh my god, Wii!
2874396	2874876	Seriously.
2875396	2876617	And then, on top of that...
2877634	2878477	It's easy.
2879058	2879600	It's there.
2879680	2880222	It's we.
2881365	2885366	So, Nintendo did a very risky, ballsy thing with this.
2885406	2891668	And I'm not trying to say that, oh, I may be a little bit of a Nintendo fanboy, but I'm just a gaming fanboy.
2891708	2892528	I like all the systems.
2893009	2896230	And, you know, I think Nintendo's just taking a big risk with this.
2896310	2899330	I think it's an interesting choice, but it's a risky choice.
2900031	2901851	And they're taking a big risk with this.
2902251	2906353	But nobody said that this next-gen console war is going to be an easy fight, right?
2906573	2907553	They can change their mind too.
2908359	2908939	I don't think they will.
2909079	2916784	I know the internet is convinced there's been stories that, well, the Wii's not trademarked so it's not the real name and all this other conspiracy theories.
2917304	2919765	Guys, I don't really see that happening.
2920326	2922487	It's the name of the console, so enjoy it.
2922687	2929811	Although I do have to say that I think Sony has really had the best idea overall with keeping a single name and just adding a number.
2931744	2933065	But you know what?
2934365	2937687	If I'm in Nintendo's shoes, I can say it's the same thing.
2937747	2938607	It's the same old thing.
2938647	2940228	It's just another freaking game thing.
2940268	2941088	It's another game system.
2941368	2943069	Nintendo doesn't want that this time.
2943129	2947631	Nintendo wants something bigger than your typical game system.
2947811	2949651	But in the end, it's a game system.
2950352	2950532	True.
2950552	2955314	You're not going to escape the fact that they are still marketing games.
2956394	2961037	They're not trying to market to non-gamers, they're trying to make non-gamers into gamers.
2962197	2964719	And so, they're trying to convert the masses.
2965219	2973103	Just remember, as you post to message forums your angst about how much you hate the name Wii, please remember the golden rule of gaming.
2974024	2976625	It's not the system, it's the games that are on it.
2976745	2979467	Right, the system is only as good as the games that are on it.
2979547	2981088	So, you know what?
2982268	2985110	If there's good games on this, you'll be proud to be a Wii owner.
2987423	2988684	Some people have always wanted a wee.
2989184	2990926	But in the meantime... Oh my god, wee!
2993868	2995269	And now for the real outro.
2998572	3001034	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
