14287	16007	Tonight, April 2nd, 2006.
16707	19788	April Fool's hits the web, but is Final Fantasy XIII a joke?
20168	22329	Is the Xbox 360 drought finally over?
22649	25470	And are UMD movies about to meet an untimely fate?
27991	37634	Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37694	40995	We are here gathered together to talk about video games today.
41377	43078	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
71242	79270	I'm eating an organic unbleached flour mushroom leek strudel with black sesame seeds on it.
79410	79750	It's delicious!
95174	96394	It's like eight of those names.
96794	98115	It's very delicious.
98815	102836	I do a lot of my shopping now at Whole Foods markets, which is all organic food.
102896	103816	It's expensive.
104296	105197	It is expensive.
105257	105637	Oh, my God.
105677	113419	But I have felt so healthy the last two months since I've started eating all organic and vegetarian and cut out red meat.
113579	115279	And I don't drink soda anymore.
115299	116180	I had a soda yesterday.
116940	121301	I had a diet vanilla Pepsi, and it made my stomach hurt.
122061	125324	I still drink diet, but I try very hard not to drink regular soda.
125344	126425	I make my own soda now.
126926	130349	I buy club soda and Torani, the flavored syrups.
130389	131469	Oh, so kind of like Italian soda.
131590	132510	Yeah, I do Italian sodas.
132831	133131	Okay.
133371	134832	Oh, because you can get the sugar-free ones.
134852	135453	Those aren't so bad.
135493	142899	And I also make carbonated lemonade using club soda and lemon juice and lime juice and Splenda.
142979	143360	Not for me.
143520	143700	Mm-mm.
144762	145422	Ice Cream Tea
173820	185420	Slice apples, popcorn, you know, like some plain popcorn, soy nuts, they're good, cashews, cashews are very good for you, they have good oils, and brown rice.
186161	187223	Alright, and super bacon.
188327	190628	No, that's bad for you.
190688	192709	That's like a heart attack recipe right there.
192909	200832	All right, let's get away from the Food Network and do a little bit of how was your gaming week, the part of the show where we talk about what we've been playing this week and what we've been up to.
200893	202853	And I know I've got a lot.
202993	205595	I don't know about the others, but DarkSakura, you always start us off.
205615	206555	What have you been playing this week?
207102	210885	Well, we've had quite a bit of new gaming coming in the house.
210925	211865	I've actually got Beatmania.
211885	213807	I've been playing the crap out of it.
213987	218410	I have Kingdom Hearts 2, but since I was already playing it in Japanese, I've been sort of not so much about that.
218810	223553	I'm going to start over on that probably within the week after I get my stupid Flash homework done.
225234	231699	And I'm also... Fry's, of all places, is carrying import PSP games.
232469	239312	I noticed that last time I went to Fry's, for those, because we're nationwide, Fry's is a big electronics chain on the West Coast, and they've started to carry limited import games.
239332	240553	Like, I saw Mahjong in the Game Boy.
241153	241633	Oh, wow.
242134	242454	That's cool.
242494	244875	The new Initial D game is really, really cool.
244915	246476	It's based off of, I think, the version 3.
248148	249069	that's out in the arcade.
249629	250929	And it's really pretty.
251209	252690	It's Eurobeat fantastic.
253650	254931	Lots and lots of Eurobeat.
256151	259593	But it's Initial D. There's not much else I can say about that.
259653	264574	They also had out the Taito collection that we're sort of considering except that it's coming out in the U.S.
264594	265895	sort of like a no point to that.
266415	269476	And we almost picked up Guilty Gear but that's also coming out in the U.S.
269516	271137	so we were sort of not so much on that too.
272917	277583	and Dan and his friend have been playing a whole lot of Burnout.
277803	278904	Oh my god.
279125	280146	I'm so tired of that game.
282048	283830	Why so tired of the Burnout?
283890	285673	Just the same thing over and over?
285833	290619	I'm in my... Okay, my computer room is on the other side of where our big TV is.
291561	296563	I'm in the middle of working on my flash homework right now is to do this big photo slideshow.
296583	298203	I've been trying to get my photos all together.
298743	301024	I'm just about to do my last little touch.
304725	308426	Great.
308987	316249	We've also had MAME action going on because one of Dan's coworkers and a friend of mine, George, Necco Boy.
316549	316709	Right.
317523	326352	He and our friend Tim, who's actually, for anyone who's in cosplay circles, he's very well known because he does the fabulous Rick Hunter Macross outfit.
327093	328695	He did Evo 1 at Anime Expo.
328715	330797	He's been in Japanese cosplay photos.
331598	335662	But he also has been helping build MAME cabinets in my garage.
337136	338217	So you have more than one now.
338837	340538	We're building George's.
340838	345181	We haven't talked about this on the show in a while, but both DarkSakura and Loki have main cabinets in their house.
345501	347862	Now, DarkSakura, you guys took a pole position?
347982	349243	We took a stand-up pole position.
349903	355846	They're building this one out of some other generic one, but it has this fabulous 1982 art on it.
356487	362850	And so it's really super cool, but they were working on this all day while me and the fabulous Miss Tia were running around.
363370	365091	Where did they get the specs on how to do this?
365192	366693	Like, are they doing it off a website?
366793	368254	Off a just crash and burn?
368294	381603	There is a website, and if you give me just a second, I can get it, because it's the one that my husband goes to, which happens to be on my favorites bar called, it's arcadecontrols.com slash arcade.htm.
381903	384204	It's basically build your own arcade controls FAQ.
384925	390709	It's how to build your, it goes a lot into the cabinets, it goes into how to build the controllers, what you need for it.
391129	392130	It's really, really neat.
392150	392490	Yeah.
394542	398905	And actually, I'll talk to Dan about getting the specs on his cabinet, so if anybody else is interested.
398925	399786	All right.
400346	400686	Sounds cool.
401027	401187	Yep.
401667	401987	All right.
402568	404209	Loki, how was your gaming week?
404249	405430	Play any of your main cabinet?
406851	408312	You actually built your cabinet.
408352	409593	You didn't convert a machine.
409653	410914	You built a brand new thing.
410934	411954	Yes, and it shows.
411994	417338	We were roommates back when you were building that, and I just remember that that was a project.
418919	420020	Yeah, to say the least.
420460	422402	Most of the project is being stored at my...
423148	430631	I played a lot of 360 stuff again I think I played a little bit of Oblivion I played more Outfit and I realized that game really sucks
450845	451205	Really?
451765	461649	Now, this isn't really my kind of game, so I haven't really been playing a lot of it, but I've listened to other shows that seem to really like this game, so what's your issue with it?
462330	468472	Well, my issue with it, I tried playing multiplayer, and again, we're just with two-player split-screen, which is fine.
469172	472534	For one, the controls really suck in it.
473014	473174	Like,
473672	482958	I kept calling in the destruction on demand, the big feature where you get stuff to fall from the sky, and the stuff falling from the sky kept crushing my characters!
483819	487101	I would aim it further away from me, and the stupid
487807	488488	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
513074	520018	Far Cry Instinct's Predator which I've never played the original Far Cry Instinct's but from what I hear it's not very different as far as graphics and stuff.
520338	524500	A little bit of graphic upgrades and stuff but it is pretty fun.
524600	528783	It is kind of, actually it's very hard, very frustrating.
529923	532204	So I started to cheat and now it's fun.
532985	535666	I love how they put the cheats in there because cheats make it fun.
535726	540549	It's still really challenging but it kind of lightens it up a little bit.
541556	554366	so I'm kind of looking forward to that and then played more Burnout more Ghost Recon and I hear that she's working that too and what else?
554566	563873	Mimai Katamari Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories all that fun stuff I played a little bit of Beatmania didn't like it oh, why not?
565254	570138	the interface is too colorful and to be honest I
570868	573589	didn't think the new controllers were that great, and I don't know why.
573609	578330	I mean, before, they seemed to be pretty good, but that turntable doesn't seem, it seems to be sticky, the turntable.
580031	581651	It loosens up after you play with it a bit.
582651	588753	I don't know, it's just, even the new songs were kind of okay, but I just wasn't very impressed by it.
588853	596515	It was just kind of, yay, cool, Beatmania, anything to be able to go, I'm not going to go rush out to go buy it, though.
597256	598416	All right.
599626	605127	My Gaming Week also consisted of Beatmania, which I picked up earlier in the week, so kind of funny there.
605147	610588	We've all played that, but of course that's not a surprise when you consider that we started as a music gaming station.
610648	612249	Obviously we owe a lot to Beatmania.
612989	618690	I think it's very interesting, Beatmania, because when you consider it, Beatmania is about, what, eight years old?
619110	622111	And this is really the first time that it's coming out in the U.S.
622391	623251	for console.
623331	624371	I mean, of course we had the
624771	625511	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
647436	675773	much more accessible to beginners in the fact that there is no separate mode for beginner mode, but they fuse the beginning level songs into the normal game, which I think is good, because I think you don't want to scare people off, because even though Beatmania is selling itself as bringing the arcade experience home, which kind of is a little weird to me, because there's really nothing but import machines for Beatmania, it's kind of weird there, but
677768	679669	I think it's a good first exposure for people.
680229	684012	I find it... There was a lot of the old 5Key music in there.
684072	684552	Did you notice?
684632	686413	Oh yeah, I noticed a lot of really old stuff.
686433	687834	Hunting for You and Metal Gear.
687854	688834	Just really, really old songs.
688854	691076	But I think that's cool because they picked some good stuff.
691496	693397	They have a very interesting song list.
693537	695659	I think the 5Key song list is actually pretty solid.
695679	696939	I think they got a good mix of stuff.
697800	704584	7Key, for me, could have used some more recent stuff, but I think I understand why they're doing what they're doing because...
705114	709539	If there is to be a second mix, then they can start dipping into the later stuff and things, you know.
711521	711681	Yeah.
711981	713002	Did you like the Moby song?
713543	714504	I did like the Moby song.
714544	715164	I like the video.
716105	717947	I think the Timo Ma song is the best, though.
718788	721791	Dan and I sat there with the Moby song going, what is this?
722532	723052	I liked it.
723132	723573	I think it's good.
724153	726015	Dan and I are both like Moby, but we just didn't like it.
726528	729710	Here's the interesting thing is that I noticed this in a lot of reviews.
729770	732772	Beatmania has been getting a lot of negative reviews out there on the circuit right now.
733172	738415	And a lot of people can't seem to not want to compare this to Guitar Hero.
738575	744839	Everybody's comparing this game to Guitar Hero, which I think is kind of funny because this game existed long before Guitar Hero.
745379	746519	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
773229	774090	They're done well.
774130	775171	The cover songs are done well.
775211	778773	They're pretty faithful to the originals, and it really ups that fun factor.
779334	789681	The problem with Beatmania, and why I don't think Beatmania is going to have that same buzz as Guitar Hero is now set at the bar, is that a lot of these songs are not recognizable to most people.
789781	792383	They tried a little bit with the song list.
792403	794304	They got Toxic and Funky Town.
794344	795345	Okay, people know those songs.
795785	799028	But there's a lot of songs in there that are not so recognizable.
799748	801110	is that a good thing or a bad thing?
801311	813870	I don't know I'm spoiled by years of Japanese releases so I do recognize all the songs that are in there it's hard for me to look at this game impartially when I've been raised on the Japanese series for years and years um
816480	817761	It's just weird.
817961	818622	I don't really know.
818862	821584	I think it's going to be interesting to see how the general public reacts to this.
821864	825707	Are they going to pick up on this game, even though there aren't a lot of recognizable songs?
825787	826067	I don't know.
826708	833093	I had some people over last night, including some people who don't play games a whole lot, and I know a few of them were really digging on Beatmania.
833113	837576	They thought it was kind of fun and very pretty, even though they didn't really recognize a lot of the songs in it.
838817	840758	Did you notice that 321 Stars is the another?
841799	843420	Yeah, just to make it a little harder there.
843601	843921	I'm like...
845905	850289	Well, plus they did something weird with five keys is that there's only the one difficulty.
850329	851510	I thought that was kind of odd.
851851	853973	They just made some very odd changes.
854053	860379	Like the one that really irks me is that they made the triple A's a lot lower in score to be able to get.
860680	862782	And just in general, the grading's a little easier.
863262	865605	And I think, I mean, I understand why they want to do that.
865645	868788	Again, they're trying to cater to the beginners and people haven't seen the game before, but
869554	870014	Beep Mania
891833	894476	It's a hell of a good first release compared to what DDR First Mix was.
894876	898239	And I think there's a potential for really great stuff in the future.
898560	904045	And you just kind of have to think, okay, if Beatmania can grow the same way DDR did, it's going to be great.
904145	906047	But, you know, we have to have a little faith here in the beginning.
906127	907668	So we'll see what happens.
908489	912413	I want to say hello to our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
912433	913254	Click a chat.
913794	915916	And always looking for your comments there.
918160	918540	Let's see.
919960	923541	The 23rd Magus says, I believe this is a response to Guitar Hero.
923881	926022	They made music games accessible.
926682	927882	They made music games accessible.
927942	929562	It's a very interesting statement.
929582	936564	A lot of people sometimes get put off by the DDR pad and by the turntables and the keys and seeing all those notes falling.
936904	938824	But there was something about Guitar Hero that was a little different.
939424	939725	I don't know.
940265	940925	Very interesting.
943225	946306	So again, if you want to join our chat, www.orangeloundtrader.com
947302	976236	and click on chat and 23rd Magus wants to also point out that they actually have the calculations if you want to look at calculations for the true AAAs that there are websites out there that will let you know how your score compares to the Japanese version one of them he's mentioning is VJ Army so pretty interesting I did notice that it was ridiculously easy but it was sort of nice because the good thing about this is that I could play it with Dan and Dan's not really a beatmania person he was playing on my old controller
977541	983907	I felt so bad for him because really my old controller is now hitting the crappy phase.
984527	993115	I think what I call these folks sometimes are the Japanese elitists out there on some of the websites that nothing is good enough unless it's the Japanese version.
993415	995217	The American versions will always be shit.
995497	1003104	I think the problem with the Japanese elitists out there on the message boards when it comes to Beatmania is that they forget that these games aren't made for them.
1004246	1008607	They think that Konami owes them something because they've been buying the games for years and years.
1009047	1014168	Okay, that got Konami to release the game here, but still, the game is not for you.
1014368	1015508	It's for everybody.
1015988	1020369	And they'll toss a couple frickin' bones at the loyal supporters.
1020409	1023890	I mean, there was a couple Night Style songs in there, and there's some kind of neat stuff.
1023930	1026650	I think just having the 5-key and 7-key in there is pretty neat.
1027430	1028711	But the game's not for you.
1029251	1029951	It's for everybody.
1030720	1034802	Well, I honestly did think that the song selection was pretty sparse in comparison.
1034922	1037683	Because think about, like, the last one that I bought was 8th style.
1038263	1041264	And think about just how many freaking songs were in 8th style.
1041884	1049327	But still, when you consider that we have both modes, I do sort of wish that you could do the 7 key stuff in 5 key mode, you know, to do that too.
1050208	1051848	But I see why they did it the way that they did.
1052308	1056350	It really is like you're getting two games in one, just both with very sparse song lists.
1057768	1059049	So I recommend Beatmania.
1059429	1063412	If for no other reason than I want to see a Beatmania second mix be released here in the US.
1063672	1064513	And you know, it is good.
1064573	1066234	I think everybody should at least check it out.
1066354	1070677	You know, because even if you're scared of DDR, there's no reason to be scared of Beatmania.
1071678	1075581	I personally, I didn't pick it up because one, I know Konami sent me a free one.
1075761	1082246	Two, because if it's anything like Guitar Hero, I'll play it once and not play it for again.
1083166	1084527	Which I did with my Guitar Hero.
1084647	1085648	It is leaning up
1086232	1091855	against my MAME cabinet because eventually it will be used for Guitar Freaks.
1091955	1093775	Guitar Hero is a party game for me.
1093835	1097137	It's sitting there in the corner and then when people come over they go, what's that?
1097437	1098137	Guitar Hero!
1099938	1102219	I think Beatmania is going to be kind of a similar thing around here.
1102259	1107281	I'm still playing it an awful lot but I find that I'm going to use my controller to go back to the Japanese mixes.
1107361	1108702	But you know, I'm different.
1108762	1110543	I'm not like most of the people listening to this show.
1111123	1114165	I've played the hell out of those Japanese mixes.
1114225	1114965	For me, this is
1116626	1119967	Good new controller plus best hits is what this game is to me.
1120008	1121588	Yeah, that really is how I feel about it.
1121608	1128872	But the good thing about it is that now I can have friends pick up, you know, who are like, oh, that's neat, but be so intimidated by it.
1129192	1131754	They've got access now to one that's going to work on their PlayStations.
1131814	1135556	They can practice at home and then come over and play the imports with me.
1136216	1139678	And it's gotten me back into Bimani because...
1140253	1147796	You know, having a new DDR arcade mix is all fine and dandy and everything, but I've got a new Beatmania in my house that I've been playing the hell out of.
1148476	1153397	And I went hunting the other day to try to find my copy of 8th Style, and I'm actually considering going and buying 10th.
1153958	1154238	Awesome.
1154698	1155538	Well, let's leave it at that.
1155578	1156198	That sums it up.
1156278	1157019	Okay, more games.
1157539	1159739	Good thing it's a slow news week, because I've got a lot of games to talk about.
1160180	1160720	Kingdom Hearts 2.
1162864	1163804	I didn't like Kingdom Hearts 1.
1164664	1165845	You know why I didn't like Kingdom Hearts 1?
1166745	1168405	The camera, the gummy ship.
1169685	1171846	Kingdom Hearts 1 was such a phenomenal idea.
1172886	1173666	But this is the weird thing.
1173826	1175067	I love the story.
1175427	1176507	I love the music.
1176707	1177847	I love the cinema.
1178267	1181968	I love everything about Kingdom Hearts except playing the game.
1182428	1183268	That's my problem.
1184368	1186769	Kingdom Hearts 2, it's all fixed.
1187219	1188300	It is all fixed.
1188580	1191001	The camera, not a problem for me anymore.
1191341	1196724	Minimap, there now to help my 3D confused butt get through the levels.
1198005	1198665	It's phenomenal.
1198865	1200887	Kingdom Hearts 2 is phenomenal.
1201007	1204308	I can't describe how incredible I think this game is.
1204408	1208811	I have not been sucked into a game this much, I don't think since the Super Nintendo game.
1209600	1212141	I have literally been playing with every spare moment I have this week.
1212181	1213001	I've been playing Kingdom Hearts 2.
1213522	1217443	I have noticed that Roxas doesn't annoy me as much in English as he does in Japanese.
1217523	1222305	I think what's great about it, and I know a lot of people have been bitching about that three-hour prologue.
1222325	1225306	I don't want to give any spoilers, but there's like a three-hour prologue, essentially.
1225966	1229428	You have to play this game for 3 hours, 3 hours 15 minutes until you see the title screen.
1230589	1238014	The nice thing about it is for those of us that didn't really play it the whole way through Kingdom Hearts 1, it really does explain it in a not cheesy manner.
1238234	1240875	Like it's kind of, I don't want to, I'm trying to do this without spoilers.
1240915	1242276	It tells it through flashbacks, essentially.
1242296	1243637	It also ties in with Chains of Memories.
1243757	1248240	Well, right, because Chains of Memories was more event, well, I knew actually quite a number of people who played it.
1248880	1252242	And actually, my plan is to go back and play Chains of Memories.
1252322	1253303	I just haven't had time to.
1254823	1256043	It's a complete story.
1256644	1258624	I like that it sort of brings you back into it.
1259024	1264465	If you're not going to play Kingdom Hearts 1, you're playing Kingdom Hearts 2, just read the spoiler fact for Chains of Memories, read the spoiler fact for Kingdom Hearts.
1265025	1268286	At least that way it'll kind of catch you up with the story and then you can enjoy the game.
1268366	1269806	You've seen the ending of Kingdom Hearts, right?
1269986	1271766	I have seen the ending of Kingdom Hearts.
1272426	1279248	It's funny because the way I was introduced to Kingdom Hearts is I dated someone a long time ago who was really, really into it and I kind of saw everything.
1279528	1280548	I got shown all of that.
1280848	1281948	I don't know.
1283273	1288657	Did you see the final movie from... I did send you the final movie from the deep dive, didn't I?
1289958	1291339	Which was... Maybe.
1291740	1296664	With the international version in Japan, after Kingdom Hearts came out, they labeled it the deep dive.
1296704	1298465	It had the Sephiroth battle in it.
1298906	1299206	Oh, okay.
1299406	1308013	And it had this extra movie file, which part of it plays in the prologue, with the nameless people at the end.
1308314	1308514	Hmm.
1310053	1311333	I'll show that to you later.
1312895	1320420	I really recommend for people before you play Kingdom Hearts to go back and get that movie off of Deep Dive because it really does tie in a lot more too.
1320800	1324883	Familiarize yourself just even the slightest bit with a Kingdom Hearts 1 story and I think you'll be okay.
1325343	1327844	The game itself is fantastic.
1327904	1329905	It's so deep.
1330025	1331786	There's so much to it.
1331906	1334567	I love the drive and the limits.
1335468	1337469	I just fought this one battle not that long ago.
1337509	1340230	It's the Beauty and the Beast level.
1340750	1342691	The final battle you do in there is in the ballroom.
1342711	1344692	You're using the chandelier to attack the monster.
1344732	1346653	I haven't been that like, whoa, at an RPG level.
1354196	1356418	since I first saw a summon in Final Fantasy VII.
1356478	1365066	Well, I heard the new system that they have where it's like this action system where you hit the triangle button depending on certain things that are going on.
1365607	1370671	It'll do kind of like the God of War where you'll do kind of cinematic attacks and stuff.
1371132	1372473	Those are really impressive in the game.
1373554	1378719	Now, Kingdom Hearts does have a few things that are kind of... Okay, here's the thing.
1379039	1379840	If you don't like...
1380954	1381755	and so on.
1402745	1403226	Setsur, Vivi,
1423200	1436982	So, there's just, the whole game is made up of these little fanboy things, and if you watch Disney movies at all, and I don't watch a lot of Disney movies, I've seen most of the big ones, but if you play the Final Fantasy games at all, there's so many things in there to just make you go, eee, eee, eee, you know, so.
1437688	1446355	I highly recommend Kingdom Hearts 2, although I think there's going to be some folks out there listening to this going, I know I wouldn't like Kingdom Hearts, I don't really like those action RPGs.
1446756	1448297	Fine, you probably won't like Kingdom Hearts.
1448317	1455063	There's nothing about this game that's really going to win you over, but I just think for those that are into these types of games, it's so in-depth, there's so much to do.
1455283	1456764	You probably already have your copy, honestly.
1458715	1459476	What else have I played this week?
1459516	1459996	I didn't end it.
1460016	1460537	There's more.
1460857	1467624	I borrowed Need for Speed Underground or Most Wanted Underground, whatever that game is on Xbox 360.
1468729	1471591	Okay, this is the weird thing about Most Wanted on 360.
1471971	1474932	It's like the showgirls of video games to me.
1474993	1477794	It's so bad, I can't stop playing it.
1478074	1482457	Now you see what I was dealing with for, what, three months at my house?
1483237	1485498	There is seriously nothing to like about that game.
1485538	1487419	The cutscenes are stupid.
1487700	1488540	I see a cop!
1488680	1489721	And washed out.
1490541	1496283	and the graphics are crap compared to Ridge Racer and even Full Auto and some of the other games I've played.
1496923	1500125	There is really not a lot to like about this game.
1500425	1501625	I can't stop playing it.
1502065	1505047	Until I got Kingdom Hearts, I could not stop playing that game.
1505927	1506807	I don't know what it is.
1508008	1516631	The cutscenes, they're done and it's supposed to be like that, the washed out, because it's supposed to be kind of like comic book-ish.
1517191	1519172	And I thought the cutscenes were actually pretty cool.
1520121	1521742	There were too many of them, granted.
1522142	1526265	The graphics weren't that bad, but they weren't much better than the Xbox version.
1527166	1530548	And, I don't know, I never really got in the need for speed.
1530808	1532709	But I thought the game was okay looking.
1532909	1534710	I liked the whole Fast and the Furious thing.
1535191	1537612	I thought you could totally tell it was an upgraded Xbox game.
1537652	1538633	You could totally tell.
1538793	1539974	Okay, that is true.
1540074	1541014	You could totally tell that.
1541435	1543476	Here's the funny thing I have to laugh about.
1543576	1545077	You know how the cutscenes are done in this?
1545297	1547859	Well, you know that game coming out, Ace Combat Zero, The Belkan War?
1547879	1548219	Imagine...
1548917	1549918	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1564404	1568448	Ridge Racer is obviously a superior game, yet I keep playing this one.
1568588	1569188	I don't know why.
1569208	1571690	Well, I'll just have to take it back and let you borrow it.
1572031	1573071	No, no.
1573452	1574172	No, you're not taking it.
1574192	1576154	No, you can take it until I beat Kingdom Hearts.
1576735	1580097	All right, let's go to chat room because I'm sure chat room has some stuff they want to say on these games.
1580418	1584721	Legend of Zaku, Kingdom Hearts 2 equals makes fanboys cream in their pants.
1585242	1585862	You know what, though?
1586122	1588504	There's things here that not just for fanboys.
1588565	1590646	I think there's a lot that's pant cream worthy.
1590666	1591767	I placed a rebuttal in the chat room.
1592228	1592568	Oh, did you?
1592808	1594910	Yeah, Kingdom Hearts 2 is fangirl fodder.
1595590	1597271	So much fangirl fodder.
1597572	1597992	It's both.
1598812	1599253	Let's see.
1599453	1602735	Also in the chat room, Rini says, VV is the friggin' win.
1603516	1609060	Absolutely, but I haven't gotten to the Tron level yet, so I'm going to hold back on the friggin' win.
1609860	1611141	It better not let me down.
1611281	1612482	Tron level better not let me down.
1612542	1613663	I've seen the Tron level.
1613903	1614504	It won't let you down.
1615544	1616885	Is it true you get to play light cycles?
1616945	1618447	Yes, you get friggin' light cycles.
1619988	1621749	But the light cycle part actually is not as cool.
1623137	1624079	But you do get light cycles.
1624820	1627464	That is great.
1627684	1629848	You're talking about all the yaoi.
1630580	1633681	DJ PooEater in the chat room, which by the way is one of my favorite nicknames ever.
1634101	1636602	DJ PooEater in chat says, nothing wrong with the fanboys.
1636662	1637382	Nope, nothing at all.
1637422	1637862	You know what?
1637982	1639622	Everybody's fanboy about something.
1639642	1641463	For some people it's football, basketball.
1641843	1645004	For some people it's, you know, crocheting.
1645464	1646444	For some people it's Kingdom Hearts.
1646504	1653226	You know they were saying that they're going to announce at E3 this year that they're continuing the Kingdom Hearts series but in a different way.
1655646	1657827	Definitely it's something they're going to keep making games.
1658399	1665203	But they're thinking about expanding in different ways, maybe not like Chains of Memories, but... God, I'm hoping... You know what?
1665883	1668364	Do you know what we were theorizing when we were playing Kingdom Hearts?
1668405	1669965	Some of the boys were over, we were talking about it.
1670566	1671126	Here's the thing.
1672006	1673928	They say they want to do something different with Kingdom Hearts.
1674648	1676929	Square Enix says they're working on a new MMO.
1677890	1678190	Hmm?
1679142	1681063	Would Kingdom Hearts not make the coolest MMO?
1681344	1683465	You know that would totally get me back to play online.
1684126	1692011	I don't think that's going to be what happens because, one, they're working on something else, not that for an MMO.
1692031	1694473	I remember hearing about it last year.
1694533	1694813	I know.
1695254	1696414	I heard that they're doing something else.
1696555	1699357	But my brain couldn't help but go there.
1701078	1702619	Something about that seems oh so right.
1702679	1703600	Can you imagine?
1704160	1706882	And the MMO could be updated with new Disney and Square Enix.
1707626	1709808	I see them doing an anime series.
1710488	1712590	Or an OAB series.
1712610	1715232	I'm very surprised they haven't already done this.
1715252	1716594	There's actually Kingdom Hearts manga.
1716794	1724180	They could do a CG, like, anime, because this game, I mean, basically cel-shaded CG anyways, and it looks really good.
1724500	1729884	I mean, it looks very realistic to, you know, true to the animated series that they're pulling from.
1730485	1734048	But, um, oh my god, it would make one hell of a kick-ass movie.
1734268	1736550	It would be one franchise Disney would
1737048	1738649	Imagine Disney, but with a more mature storyline to it.
1765347	1768170	and you get to interact with it and be in it.
1768210	1770031	That's the great thing about this game.
1770051	1771553	And she was kind of like, hmm, sounds interesting.
1773034	1779120	It's kind of interesting to try and explain Kingdom Hearts and I'm thinking, you get to interact with Winnie the Pooh in Mulan.
1781882	1783824	The games are a lot more hardcore than that.
1784044	1784785	I know, I know.
1785345	1786747	But it's so hard to explain.
1787600	1788860	Okay.
1788961	1789321	Let's see.
1789861	1790921	More comments from chat room.
1790961	1792122	More, more, more.
1792222	1796043	Dirty Thief theorizes Kingdom Hearts 3 could be a theatrical sequel for the movies.
1796163	1797504	I hope that's what I'm hoping for.
1798244	1805066	GS191 says, I would be okay with a Kingdom Hearts MMO, but do a damn true sequel to Super Mario RPG first.
1805246	1806087	Seriously.
1806387	1807047	Definitely.
1807487	1808408	This is what we need.
1808769	1810371	Screw this Paper Mario crap.
1810671	1812333	I am done with Paper Mario.
1812833	1815777	I want a goddamn Super Mario RPG 2.
1817138	1818219	Just remake the whole damn thing.
1818239	1821884	Dirty Thief in our chatroom says everyone's going to be a Keyblade holder if you do a
1822404	1823325	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1852186	1854409	I think it would be a perfect MMO, but what do I know?
1854590	1855170	I don't design them.
1856712	1859196	Tigerclaw says, hey, how about a Super Mario MMO, huh?
1861038	1862961	Dirty Thief says he has a way to explain Kingdom Hearts.
1863261	1863982	You like Disney?
1864222	1865284	You like Final Fantasy?
1865704	1866025	Play it.
1867964	1868304	April Fool's Day
1883642	1887506	April Fool's is actually against my religion, so I don't really practice April Fool's.
1887746	1889968	You'll notice Orange Lawns Radio, we did no April Fool's gag.
1890008	1892350	There will be no gag in tonight's program, I'm sorry.
1893331	1896253	We did a gag last year, but it was stupid and obvious.
1896493	1903359	And we thought about doing them this year, but then we realized, or at least I was realizing... We're just too lazy and procrastinate too much.
1903980	1909705	In the time it takes to set up an April Fool's prank, I could be doing something more constructive for the website in the long term.
1909765	1911066	I like the one we did on DDR Freak.
1911806	1912569	We changed it into Rot 13.
1918948	1927330	Honestly, I have to admit, as it's been with the past three years of the DDR freak April Fool's prank, I click, I go to the site, I roll my eyes, I go somewhere else.
1927430	1929571	That's been my April Fool's visits.
1929831	1932291	I was lax in my moderator duties yesterday.
1932411	1933151	Everybody was.
1933331	1936352	To be honest, I think the Blizzard ones have been the best.
1936372	1937552	Blizzard has had some good ones.
1937593	1940933	The Panda Express or Pandaren Express, whatever it was in their name.
1940993	1941854	Did you see this one?
1941874	1942214	What was it?
1942234	1944034	Yeah, the new alliance class is the Wisp.
1945194	1946195	No, not the Wisp.
1946235	1947955	Was it Burger Craft?
1948450	1948650	Oh yeah.
1948670	1952134	And their new fast food chain that they're going to... That was hilarious.
1952234	1953095	I think that's great.
1955317	1958140	What were some other great April Fool's pranks played out there on the internet?
1958301	1960083	GameFAQs telling you not to cheat.
1961224	1966429	Actually, my favorite one... Another site that I moderate on is Gorillas Unofficial.
1967410	1969332	And that was actually my favorite prank.
1969493	1969673	And I...
1971274	1971454	Uh-huh.
1988063	1996657	for anyone who keeps up with the whole Gorillaz fandom saying that Paula was rejoining Gorillaz and that Noodle was out of the picture for a while and I was like, oh yeah!
1996717	2000123	I just loved watching everybody going, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
2000343	2001084	And I'm sitting there going...
2002375	2004836	You know what's funny is I read about that on the Wikipedia.
2004856	2008717	Like, Wikipedia had a giant list of every April Fool's prank on the internet yesterday.
2009358	2010438	And that was on there.
2010458	2011898	It was Girls Unofficial Prank.
2012559	2014219	I loved Slashdot's prank.
2014259	2017000	They turned the site pink and was like, you know, my little pony.
2019881	2022062	Just nerdy stuff that was cute.
2022882	2027426	I actually, nobody got my prank because people, I guess, believed it and didn't comment on it.
2028346	2029427	No, I knew it was a prank.
2029447	2030808	The one in your LJ?
2030968	2036272	I said that I was leaving my job next month to be a writer for a holistic magazine.
2036513	2038054	And you know what my reaction was to that?
2038154	2040355	I went, I read it, I rolled my eyes and went to the next story.
2040375	2041216	I didn't even read it.
2041436	2043318	But people believed mine from two years ago.
2044278	2044759	Which one was that?
2044779	2046160	When I said I was moving to Washington.
2046752	2048193	because you'd threatened to do it before.
2048273	2052355	Because Dan's been wanting to move us to Washington now for like the past five years.
2053836	2057078	The very first episode of this program you said something about moving to Washington.
2057098	2057919	That hasn't happened yet.
2058019	2058619	You can't go.
2058679	2059299	You have this show.
2059339	2060100	You can't go.
2060220	2062321	But I can do a spin-off in Washington.
2063762	2065883	A spin-off will be called It's Raining Here.
2066984	2069225	It's raining rain.
2069325	2070966	We should, though, bring up our announcement.
2071887	2072187	About what?
2073456	2074356	We have an announcement.
2074376	2075277	This is not a fool's print.
2075297	2075737	This is legit.
2075757	2082700	This is a real, honest to God, or whoever you believe in, announcement.
2083621	2088583	We are doing two panels at Fonamay this year in San Jose.
2088603	2090304	I'll be getting dates and everything.
2090324	2091664	We'll be putting it up on our website.
2091904	2092845	Memorial Day weekend, right?
2093005	2095206	It is Memorial Day weekend, last weekend in May.
2096201	2097765	We will be there with two panels.
2098126	2100130	One for sure is on podcasting.
2101092	2102496	We'll be doing full-on presentations.
2102556	2103378	I will be cosplaying.
2104844	2105444	I might too.
2105985	2107425	I have some ideas on what I want to do.
2107525	2117809	I am actually taking a suggestion by one of our long-time listeners, DJ Ranma S, and I am cosplaying Tamari from Naruto, like everybody else in the universe freaking cosplays Naruto.
2117950	2120190	I have an idea for cosplay, but I'll tell you off air.
2120551	2122611	I think it's easy, and I think it's cute, and we could all do it.
2122952	2130835	But then I had another idea, because Tim, who came over, gave us Resident Evil Stars Airsoft Guns with Laser Sights.
2131460	2133221	Dan and I have been shooting each other all day.
2133281	2134362	It's been fantastic.
2134982	2138024	So I'm sort of thinking about reviving the Jill costume, but I'm not sure.
2138604	2138844	Awesome.
2139205	2143087	Okay, we're about like 40 minutes into the show and we haven't even gotten to the first story yet, so we have to keep moving.
2143227	2143747	Video games?
2143807	2144488	What the hell?
2144648	2145508	Fandomaze is going to be happening.
2145528	2146449	So we're doing podcasting and what?
2146469	2147730	The other one is just gaming?
2147830	2148150	Gaming.
2148550	2149391	E3 wrap-up or something?
2149691	2149871	Yeah.
2149911	2150631	Something like that.
2150911	2153313	Yeah, it will be right after E3, so yeah, that'll be...
2153581	2154802	Okay, so check that out.
2154882	2155522	It'll be awesome.
2155542	2155902	We'll be there.
2155942	2158484	We'll probably be giving stuff out too and all that good stuff.
2158504	2162626	We will be doing, I know for sure that our panel, one of them is on Saturday.
2162666	2165528	I'll be getting official times as soon as they're given to me by my contact.
2165548	2165868	Sweet.
2166128	2167469	We'll post all that info on the website.
2167489	2171231	Thank you to Faname for inviting us and letting us ruin your con.
2174413	2176154	No, no, no, no Rob is Manfei.
2176434	2177275	Manfei has been done.
2177295	2179456	Is that something in the chat room there?
2181213	2182714	23 Magus brought that up.
2183074	2183794	I'm not going to be Manfei.
2183854	2191058	For any cosplayers, Manfei is this guy who's not very attractive cosplaying Fei from Cowboy Bebop.
2192099	2192799	Yeah, it doesn't work.
2192840	2197202	Look, Ranma's offering to send me the Black Mage costume I wore at Katsukan.
2197242	2197682	Here's the thing.
2198103	2202665	If you listen to the first 30 minutes of the show, you know where my fanboyism is right now.
2203766	2205187	So fill in the blanks.
2205207	2208248	You can guess what I probably have planned for the cast of OLR.
2208589	2208809	You're...
2209560	2214245	Final Fantasy XIII is going to be a surprise at May's E3.
2233704	2240307	There's going to be a brief teaser video and confirmation from the publisher that the RPG will be a PlayStation 3 exclusive.
2240647	2243729	And of course, now, 1UP published this on March 30th of 06.
2244309	2245990	People were saying it was an early April Fool's joke.
2246270	2254714	But 1UP, and in fact, even Square Enix came out and said, Don't forget that people like to play April Fool's pranks around this time of year.
2254754	2260176	But 1UP published another story that said, No, Square Enix is trying to deflect.
2260636	2262437	We have inside sources that says this is going to happen.
2264507	2278231	And that was followed up by Game Informer saying, while there have been numerous rumors about Final Fantasy XIII, Square Enix has never released any information about the title.
2278651	2285393	The recent online article stating that the title being exclusive for PlayStation 3 and Shona A3 is not based on any official information obtained by us.
2286133	2298739	I hope the readers will remember April Fool's Day is tomorrow and many print and online outlets pull pranks every year before they get their hopes crushed by a joke.
2299379	2300939	So, still rumor.
2301420	2306162	And 1up.com ran a follow-up story that said, nope, Square Enix is just trying to deflect.
2306542	2308403	We have inside sources that says this is the real deal.
2309163	2311084	Now, I think, logically...
2311980	2318951	We all know Final Fantasy 13 is going to happen on PlayStation 3 because, let's see, you had 7, 8, 9 on PlayStation, 10, 11, 12 on PlayStation 2.
2322423	2324024	13, 14, 15 on PlayStation 3.
2324364	2325204	Seems pretty logical.
2325244	2328805	We also had the first three on the NES and the second three on the SNES.
2329006	2329686	Exactly right.
2329706	2330206	They've always... 3, 3, 3.
2330326	2336008	The only big shock was that they moved from Nintendo to Sony, but that's years old news.
2336028	2340730	And the graphic comes out on the stupid GameCube.
2340930	2342810	And 10, 2, I'm not even counting any of that.
2342870	2343731	I'm not counting any of that.
2344795	2346917	It's inevitable we're getting Final Fantasy XIII on PlayStation 3.
2348258	2350619	It would be hard to talk me out of that notion.
2350900	2351840	Well, here's what the problem is.
2351860	2358665	The surprise is, XII's not even out on shelves over here yet, so to announce XIII seems a little... Well, here's what I don't like.
2358685	2364309	I don't like people ruining surprises like this, for one, because, yeah, of course they're always going to have something that they're surprising everybody with.
2364349	2371595	Hell, we probably know stuff that we can surprise people with that I haven't heard about yet, but obviously you can't say anything about it until E3, so... Yeah.
2374861	2376183	E3, Final Fantasy XII, Will in the United States
2388723	2389964	They just released Kingdom Hearts.
2390264	2392365	I don't think XI has any life left in it.
2393425	2394566	And their expansion's coming out.
2394606	2397507	I think it'll be the last one.
2397527	2399548	I'm going to get hate mail.
2399688	2402510	All that crap that they showed last year that never came out.
2403410	2405851	I don't want to get hate mail from the Final Fantasy XI fans.
2406271	2408552	I'm just saying I think this next expansion is the last one.
2408593	2409933	I don't see them doing another one after this.
2409953	2411334	Because they've done three expansions now.
2411654	2413635	Because Rise of the Zillert technically was an expansion.
2413655	2415336	We just got it for free here in the US.
2415716	2415796	So.
2416598	2418219	I bet one more will be coming out and that's about it.
2418919	2420820	I think a new MMO will replace it.
2421341	2422581	But that's just my thoughts.
2422661	2423202	Alright, anyway.
2424502	2429785	Now, I know some buddies of mine were in town this weekend and one thing they did today was go shopping for an Xbox 360.
2430966	2432747	And why would today be the day for that, Loki?
2432787	2444553	Today would be the day because everyone has been hoarding them up because all those increased shipments, Best Buy and Target and stores like such were doing their, I guess, third launch of the system.
2445014	2451319	Best Buy's had 60 systems per store and I think it was similar over at Target and whatnot.
2451599	2452199	So they're out there.
2452359	2453801	You can find them now, finally.
2464738	2465338	They're crazy.
2465378	2466918	They drove by at like 3 a.m.
2466959	2468459	to make sure there wasn't going to be a line.
2468799	2471700	And then they came back, went to bed, and went right before it opened.
2472060	2474940	And sure enough, he got there and got a premium system.
2474960	2476501	And he said they had 80 in stock.
2476781	2478261	They still have some there right now.
2478341	2483082	He called a little bit ago because I think he wanted to take it back because he was afraid something was wrong with it.
2483142	2483462	I don't know.
2483482	2484442	I haven't been following the whole thing.
2484622	2485363	I'll grill him in Part B.
2487618	2489879	Yeah, they apparently still have a bunch in stock.
2489939	2491700	And it's not just Best Buy doing this.
2491780	2494341	GameStop was going to release a bunch today as well.
2494401	2495401	GameStop had some.
2495421	2495621	EB.
2495962	2498603	And I think somebody else was doing this too.
2498623	2504565	I overheard GameStop earlier this week when I picked up Far Cry that they were going to be having more in.
2505326	2506706	So that's great.
2507046	2515550	I mean, that's great because now we'll see some better games come out because some of the publishers have been pushing back their games because they're afraid that there's not many units out there to sell their games.
2515650	2515870	Yeah.
2516584	2519746	That's why the whole Splinter Cell Double Agent got pushed back to September.
2519966	2522387	Does this mean the shortage is over of Xbox 360s?
2522427	2522827	This is it?
2522927	2523268	The end?
2523788	2524408	It's getting better.
2524488	2525169	Let me put it that way.
2525629	2525889	Okay.
2526589	2528150	I know our company is selling them in May.
2528290	2531092	We're going to have them for sure in May in all of our warehouses.
2531992	2534433	So I get them like $5 cheaper than retail.
2534694	2535134	I'm just asking.
2535154	2537115	Can we declare the shortage officially over now?
2538504	2544726	When 80 Xbox 360s are sitting there in Best Buy and there's still some on the shelf halfway through the day, does that mean the shortage is over?
2545167	2546987	I would say, well, think about it this way.
2547287	2550849	They're going to be getting maybe about half that next week.
2551129	2554510	I mean, so they're going to start getting them regularly on the shelves.
2554610	2557271	So if you don't have one yet, now you can probably get one.
2557831	2562013	And it's a good time, too, because you're starting to get, you know, the games are starting to slow down a little bit.
2562113	2564294	You know, it's kind of dip in the year.
2565112	2566853	And there's plenty of good titles out right now.
2567673	2571075	March was a great month, so go for it.
2587222	2597007	This is floating around the internet this week where Iwata over at Nintendo is saying that the simultaneous global revolution launch is not going to be likely.
2597448	2604431	Quote, we don't think it's necessary to do the simultaneous worldwide launch simply because others are doing this.
2606072	2610755	Sony, of course, is doing this big thing where they're going to do a worldwide launch and they're supposed to be region free and all that stuff.
2611115	2614777	Nintendo's saying, maybe we don't need to do this same thing.
2615549	2637263	so could that mean that the revolution comes out in Japan this year and we still have to wait I hope not I think it's going to be out in both markets for the end of the year are we talking two week difference month difference who knows I think they'll launch it worldwide if they have the amount you know the units to do it I mean because why not but if they don't big deal
2638328	2649197	I think the unfortunate thing is that some of the countries are probably going to get the shaft, that usually tend to get the shaft when it comes to these launches, like Australia, sorry guys.
2649938	2660046	Some of those other countries that aren't the US, Japan, and Europe, and even Europe gets the shaft half the time, probably aren't going to see this at the same time, which is too bad.
2660527	2661187	It's unfortunate.
2661207	2662548	But we'll see.
2663009	2663309	We'll see.
2665431	2665731	Alright.
2668482	2671685	Let's go over to Loki, who has another follow-up story there on the Revolution.
2673006	2694664	Of course, kind of tying in with the whole Revolution being cheaper than the competition out there, the Revolution first-party games are going to be seeing a price tag of basically $50 or less, which, you know, good and all, but I don't think it's too impressive because if you look at the first-party 360 games, those are also $50, so I don't know.
2697779	2713903	Hopefully that'll kind of start the trend of games being a little bit cheaper, but since, you know, obviously the development costs are going to be less than, you know, developing for the 360 and the PlayStation 3, I could definitely see them having, you know, cheaper games.
2714883	2719604	Yeah, I mean, it would be kind of stupid to release the least expensive system and then the most expensive games.
2720071	2721913	So I think this kind of makes sense.
2721933	2728560	And Nintendo's, I think, trying to affirm that, yes, we're going to be the cheapest system when this thing releases.
2729060	2734366	And I think their games have to match that, is that the games have to stay competitive.
2734786	2735367	But you're right.
2735407	2737489	I mean, it's not that competitive.
2737549	2743535	If they'd come out and said, no game under $40 or even $30, now that would be, whoa, that would be something else.
2745741	2757365	In not so much console gaming news, but going on to a certainly big gaming event that's happening this month, right around DarkSakura's birthday, we have the Silent Hill movie coming out, right?
2757725	2765187	Yes, there's actually a little bit of talk from Roger Avery, who is the author of the screenplay for the Silent Hill movie.
2766228	2770429	He has basically tried to give his assurances that it will be
2771135	2776976	Very much based around the actual games, which a lot of us who've been looking into this have heard him say already.
2777836	2790259	But he did speak to a reporter in Hollywood recently and he's quoted saying, And I knew how passionate the video game fans are for Silent Hill.
2790639	2792539	At the minimum, we didn't want to piss them off.
2792559	2794200	We want to make this movie for them.
2796942	2802187	He also mentioned that it isn't always that way with video game tie-ins.
2804390	2808434	Another quote from him says, Hollywood executives are very quick to throw out the source material of the game.
2808874	2809755	Doom kills me.
2810176	2812558	This was one of the movies I wanted to do so badly.
2812658	2816202	I met with them early on and I looked at the original script and asked them, where's the doom in this?
2819059	2820560	Well, the doom in this will be the box office.
2820600	2822581	Don't you remember the first person shooter part?
2823802	2828964	Well, at any rate, I do also have a UK release date for the movie.
2829765	2830945	It will be out on April 25th.
2831086	2832746	Oh, that's not much of a delay.
2832967	2833767	Not much of a delay at all.
2834607	2835148	Ours is the 21st.
2836447	2840110	That's nothing for standard movie delays, so awesome.
2841531	2843113	I've said this on the show before, I'll say it again.
2843233	2860927	I think when we were lucky enough to go to Konami Gamers Day a few months ago to have Akira Yamaoka sitting next to Christoph Gans introducing the trailer together saying, we are bringing this to you, and Akira Yamaoka of course being the producer of the last two Silent Hill games and doing all the music for all of them.
2861707	2864408	and, you know, Christoph Gans being the director, I think that spoke volumes right there.
2864488	2865989	That they're working together.
2866029	2867290	They're presenting this together.
2867950	2870411	And I don't think you ever saw that happen with previous games.
2870431	2878335	You know, sure, maybe they say nice things about each other before the movie came out, and then after the movie comes out, they all distance themselves from each other and blame each other for the movie sucking.
2878616	2885799	I like how they, like, explain, you know, the differences between... Obviously, this movie's based on the first and third games.
2886860	2891322	And I like how they explain the differences between why the main character is a female instead of male.
2891813	2914831	and stuff like that and it made a lot of sense and it's not like oh well we did this because uh we get this actress or you know we did this because we wanted explosions or you know something stupid so I definitely am confident that this will finally be a Sean Bean a good movie you get the sense that this movie is a little more Japanese than any other
2915427	2916548	Game Movie We've Gotten Yet.
2936370	2940011	Then again, we might be a little bit more mellow since it'll be the day after.
2940051	2940611	No, that's true.
2941211	2941891	I'll be hungover.
2943532	2945652	Loki, you have a follow-up relating to Silent Hill.
2945972	2950993	Yes, of course, to tie in with the movie release, Konami's announced a few things.
2951153	2954054	Of course, he previously announced Silent Hill Experience.
2954934	2956675	That one actually has a date now.
2956715	2962216	It's going to be coming out, well, maybe a little bit after the movie, on May 28th.
2963796	2971321	which is actually, if I remember correctly, the same day as the Metal Gear Solid Digital Comic, which, you know, same week there.
2972102	2972842	So that's kind of cool.
2973182	2982348	And that's basically, you know, a bunch of digital comics and music and some, you know, backstory to some of the Silent Hill games, kind of tying it all together nicely for the PSP.
2982648	2992335	And then, of course, also announced is the Silent Hill Collection for the PlayStation 2, which is including games 2 through 4, and that's slated for April 13th.
2993311	2995213	About a week or so before the movie.
2996794	2998455	You know what we need is the Game Boy one.
3000357	3001658	I keep forgetting about that one.
3001758	3003039	Because we never got it over here.
3003059	3004440	Or maybe it would be a bonus or something.
3005461	3006922	Could be like a bonus unlockable, who knows.
3007663	3008083	I don't know.
3008644	3013468	I haven't actually found the translation of it outside of, you know, FAQ format.
3014228	3014809	Been hunting it.
3015103	3018005	Speaking of movies, you know I got invited to go see Stay Alive this weekend.
3018365	3018805	I'm sorry.
3018885	3019446	I turned it down.
3021287	3025790	I'm like, yeah, I know I do the show on video games and stuff but I just really don't want to see it.
3026607	3028268	Even though somebody gave it a not-so-bad review.
3028289	3030891	Didn't we get a not-so-bad review in the mailbag last week?
3030971	3033053	I still just... I'll wait for Netflix.
3033133	3034794	It's not something I can make myself go see.
3035535	3040619	Somebody was mentioning it in chatroom right now, so I just wanted to drop that.
3040719	3041960	Moving on to other gaming news.
3042461	3043261	Mario Bros.
3043381	3043842	DS.
3044642	3047105	It was announced a little while ago, and they keep pushing it back.
3047125	3047765	Well, guess what?
3047785	3049707	It got pushed back one more time.
3049827	3053370	May 21st, over on the game's homepage, is when they say this game's coming out.
3053730	3056973	Now that's not too bad of a delay because it was only a week.
3057454	3065261	However, now people are theorizing that, hmm, could this be because the DS Lite is being positioned somewhere around here?
3065602	3068525	Because of course Super Mario is probably going to be the next big...
3069265	3071786	DS game after this Tetris Metroid combo we got.
3072066	3075886	So maybe the light is being positioned to be launched at the same time.
3075906	3078407	That would be a good packing game with the DS light.
3078447	3080307	It would be a very good packing game for the DS light.
3080347	3082488	So maybe this is why the repositioning is happening.
3082868	3088729	Of course, we won't know the answers until E3, which is kind of a running theme across most of our stories over the next couple months.
3089749	3094350	Everything will be... It's like one of those movies or one of those games with a really contorted plot.
3094711	3096511	Everything is explained at the end.
3097515	3099275	Everything will be explained at E3.
3099515	3101256	And if it's not explained, we're going to be pissed.
3101436	3111158	Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, and I was reminded by Illusion here, the other thing they announced was they're doing a Silent Hill game for the PSP, not the Silent Hill Experience on top of that.
3111198	3111678	That's right.
3112138	3112838	I read that too.
3112858	3114859	They're going to do a whole new game on the PSP.
3115319	3117719	The rumor is that it's supposed to be a remake of the first one.
3118079	3118399	I don't know.
3118679	3121080	Maybe a remake of the first one with the characters from the movie?
3121519	3126681	I've been actually hearing about a possibility of them doing the movie version of the game.
3127281	3130422	Which is ironic because I did that as my homework in Illustrator.
3131783	3134804	And you also posted a recent homework thing to our forums, huh?
3134844	3138045	Like a scary little thing that made me jump out of my chair when I clicked on it.
3138306	3138726	That's right.
3139646	3142967	I'll post it in the chat room.
3143528	3146149	For my Flash homework, we were supposed to animate a banner.
3146809	3149410	So what I did is, not a banner, but animate an ad.
3149790	3151411	So we're going to start working on our new website.
3165864	3171888	I'm actually going to be doing a Splash Forest within the next couple of months because my spring break is actually next month.
3172089	3172949	Very cool.
3173129	3179234	I'm excited to hear Silent Hill is coming to the PSP because I think that's one of those franchises you can't really do on the DS as well as you can the PSP.
3179534	3186840	I think the PSP's technology with the movies, I think it'll lend itself a lot better to the Silent Hill franchise than the DS would.
3187961	3191464	That's me tossing the PSP fans that say I rip on the PSP too much.
3191804	3193085	That's me tossing you guys a bone there.
3193125	3194405	I think Silent Hill will kick butt.
3194425	3196426	I don't think they could do it on the DS as well.
3196446	3197726	We don't rip on the PSP fans.
3197766	3200607	We have a whole page dedicated to the PSP.
3200647	3201368	That's true.
3201548	3201828	I know.
3202128	3202808	A whole website.
3203428	3204749	A couple weeks ago they were getting vicious.
3205669	3205949	All right.
3206310	3212632	Anyway, now the 360 has kind of gotten a cold shoulder in Japan.
3212872	3213792	People kind of don't care.
3214413	3216834	But what's Microsoft going to do to try and make people care?
3216974	3217974	They're going to do over.
3219107	3220188	Can we get a do-over?
3220448	3227853	They're going to relaunch the 360 in Japan on, well, the rumor date right now is June 29th.
3228033	3236498	It's supposed to coincide with many of the new games coming out, especially one of my favorites, Chromehounds, is going to be coming around that time.
3237159	3238800	But some better games will be out by then.
3239941	3243103	I don't see how you can actually do over a launch.
3243583	3245404	You can't just pretend it doesn't happen.
3245484	3246365	I mean, it's like,
3246880	3251321	We need to put more systems out there and go, hey look, we're here still.
3251957	3252997	SUPER JAPANESE HAPPY CONSOLE!
3280265	3281886	Play all your favorite games!
3282546	3283446	I don't know.
3283506	3284126	I don't think so.
3284967	3286047	I don't think it'll be that bad.
3287668	3288488	We'll see what happens.
3288648	3289408	360, I choose you.
3291729	3292049	All right.
3292609	3300212	Since we're traveling abroad right now, DarkSakura likes to travel the world from her computer and tell us what's going on in the UK for our buddies over there overseas.
3300312	3300632	What's up?
3300812	3302272	I am so friggin' international.
3303753	3306834	There's been an update to the World of Warcraft downloader.
3308564	3313185	Basically, we've had a bunch of players saying, Blizzard, no.
3314865	3326328	So they actually did a change with a patch of 1.10 that's meaning the downloader will run constantly even if the program is closed.
3328168	3335850	So there's a quote on here from one of the World of Warcraft players from the forums.
3338340	3346082	So I was playing Wednesday morning after installing the 1.0 patch, and in the middle of playing my firewall says the Blizzard downloader is still trying to make an outgoing connection.
3347022	3347262	Yeah.
3347662	3348382	Stealing bandwidth.
3348742	3349102	Not good.
3349622	3350082	Interesting.
3350602	3351863	Now, I heard about the new patch.
3351903	3353543	I mean, that was a worldwide thing, of course.
3353763	3358184	But of course, you know, things that happen in the UK and picked up over there often happen over here.
3359144	3360884	But I didn't know about that.
3360924	3361584	That's interesting.
3361624	3364305	Basically, they're taking the BitTorrent method.
3364884	3368525	Right, and they've done that before, but they didn't run in the background.
3368605	3369766	That sounds like the difference there.
3370406	3371326	You knew when it was running.
3371766	3372286	That's interesting.
3372346	3377728	Well, basically, when you're done downloading the patch, the connection's going to stay open so that you can share with everybody else.
3378508	3381689	You are becoming part of the whole network.
3384567	3410787	but you know all you're sending out is the patch content but a lot of people were saying that you know part of the agreement is that they never once agreed to offer up their services to Blizzard they're paying Blizzard for their services instead so Blizzard updated their downloader with an option that you can make it stop running in the background you can turn it off if you want to hmm
3411283	3411584	Interesting.
3411804	3417034	But yeah, I honestly think that it was a very poor practice on their part.
3417315	3418918	Where I understand the logic behind it.
3419383	3420664	Especially with such a huge patch.
3421064	3425428	It's not really, I don't recall seeing anything to that effect in the user agreement.
3425788	3433495	I mean, I'll look back through it again, but I really don't believe that, and you allow yourself to, you know, your bandwidth to be used for Blizzard's own purposes.
3433915	3442522	But to Blizzard's credit, they've been making a lot of mistakes this year, because I can't help but think back to the, you know, politically-ish issue from a few months ago.
3442883	3446486	But they've been pretty good about coming up with really intelligent fixes, you know.
3447086	3451489	Not always the fastest way, but at least they fixed their mistakes, unlike some companies.
3451650	3453151	So, gotta hand it to them there.
3454312	3454672	What else?
3455292	3458515	We also have a demo for Blazing Angels on the PC.
3459696	3467842	There is a 467 megabyte download available for the demo.
3469363	3474467	You get to train a biplane, fire around Dunkirk and London, shoot stuff.
3475528	3475628	Um...
3476874	3485862	I'll go ahead and link the demo in the chat room, but it is available at 3dgamers.com slash games slash Blazing Angels.
3487163	3487543	All right.
3488944	3496271	We also have a demo for Galactic Civ 2 by Stardock Corporation.
3497812	3501095	It's called Galactic Civilizations 2 Dreadlords.
3501175	3503597	It's the sequel to, I guess, the first one.
3504395	3508077	But it's set in the future where you go into space.
3511319	3516882	You have different factions that you choose from, different available options for customization.
3518663	3522345	The demo for this is also up at 3D Gamers.
3523105	3528968	If you go to 3dgamers.com slash game slash galactic civ 2 slash downloads, you can find it there as well.
3529489	3530609	And I'll also link that in the chat room.
3533711	3533851	Cool.
3535007	3560868	and the last one that I have is Nintendo is offering basically their European audience a chance to air their grievances basically there was such a long delay for Animal Crossing Wild World a lot of people got very upset over this in fact
3562870	3573375	There was a website opened up called Nintendo of Europe Watch to basically go over a lot of the problems, including a Hall of Fame, a Hall of Shame for good and bad release schedules.
3577556	3584779	There were a few games that they mentioned that made it over there before they made it here first, like Another Code, which I had been waiting on for a while.
3586920	3588341	But there are...
3589278	3592059	Delays from days to months.
3592139	3597920	And even with the release schedules that I've announced, there's been lots of different changes going between them.
3598040	3603461	I seem to recall reading when I checked out that site that WarioWare Twisted was just coming out over there.
3603561	3605662	And that game came out here last year.
3606042	3607662	I mean, that was a horrendous delay.
3607722	3612483	I don't know what caused that, but they didn't get that game for six, nine months after we got it.
3613004	3614584	Which is too bad, because it's kind of a cool game.
3614944	3618605	But there's more interesting stuff on the DS now.
3619164	3620725	I don't know.
3620765	3635919	But I would check out that site, Nintendo of Europe Watch, because it's a place to... I mean, it's basically giving people an opportunity to voice their concerns over the massive changes in... And even if you're in the US, you can see just how good you have it.
3636900	3637160	Yeah.
3637881	3645348	Yeah, we really... They've been pretty much on the level with us, but then again, we can go to Washington and knock on their door.
3645368	3645588	Yeah.
3646226	3649667	But, you know, at the same time, we sometimes feel like we have to wait for Japan to get it.
3649887	3650507	Then we'll get it.
3650887	3651687	Then Europe gets it.
3652607	3654648	We're not on the top of the ladder either.
3655008	3655228	No.
3655628	3659069	But, of course, it depends on the type of game because, of course, we get some games before Japan does.
3659549	3660789	It all depends on who's making it.
3661469	3661669	Yep.
3661989	3662269	All right.
3662950	3667471	And the last bit of news is release dates.
3668011	3670651	Going over the upcoming release dates for this week.
3672292	3673772	All these are going to be on the 7th.
3675278	3694265	Death Jam Fight for New York, Hooray, Iron Warriors, Lara Croft Tomb Raider Legend, Magna Carta on PS2, Painkiller Hell Wars on Xbox, Polarium Advance on GBA, Top Spin 2, Auto Assault on PC, Dragon Quest VIII, Sims 2, Family Fun Stuff, Mega Man Battle Network 5.
3703427	3706789	Didn't Def Jam Fight for New York come out here like a year ago?
3706809	3708890	Because I remember incessantly making fun of that title.
3710170	3710270	Oh.
3710871	3711511	Yeah, it's PSP.
3711571	3712231	Oh, never mind.
3712371	3712832	Never mind.
3713152	3713572	Never mind.
3715093	3715713	I stand corrected.
3716934	3717254	Thank you.
3717274	3719055	We also get Tomb Raider for us.
3719535	3719795	Yes.
3719835	3720616	Hey, that's one for you.
3720636	3721196	Okay?
3721436	3722496	But it is items.
3722597	3724838	Hooray, the 20 millionth Tomb Raider game.
3725098	3728439	You know, Tomb Raider 2 I actually liked for two things.
3729420	3731441	One was locking the annoying butler in the freezer.
3732458	3734660	And... Because then he didn't follow you around anymore in the house.
3735080	3739944	And the second is hopping up on the balcony in her main room and making her jump off and break her neck.
3740364	3742105	How fun.
3742125	3743246	You could also make her explode.
3744567	3746669	There was a little button press code you could do to make her explode.
3747129	3747669	It was awesome.
3748090	3748670	Eat Taco Bell?
3749651	3749791	No.
3750331	3751612	Loki, what's coming out in the U.S.?
3752273	3752713	The U.S.?
3753154	3753934	Not too much this week.
3753974	3754835	It's actually pretty slow.
3754895	3758357	But for the PC, you've got full Spectrum Warrior 10 hammers.
3758417	3759959	Only about a week late, but still pretty good.
3761140	3761520	Also...
3762708	3763769	Wow, Double Dare 3?
3763849	3766050	That's pretty lame.
3767351	3771594	Anyways, um... Yeah, so apparently not any... What, like the Nick show, Double Dare?
3772094	3772775	The Nickelodeon?
3773055	3773455	Yeah.
3774956	3776177	Wow, okay, whatever.
3776858	3778158	Anyways, uh, not too much.
3780207	3786036	PlayStation 2-wise, you've got MLB 2K6, same also coming out on the Xbox this week.
3787057	3794929	Also, you've got for the PlayStation 2 Tourist Trophy, which is going to be the Gran Turismo of Motorcycles.
3796174	3801538	and Commando Strike Force on both PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
3802298	3822212	And finally, if you happen to be a fan of basketball games, NBA Ballers Phenoms finally coming out on PlayStation 2 and also on PSP from Russia with Love and Bust a Move Deluxe, which is pretty cool, and Kabbalah's Dangerous Hunts for the redneck in you.
3822475	3827038	I have a hard time believing Bust a Move Deluxe is cool because it's going to be the same fucking game on another system.
3827458	3828219	I mean, come on.
3828919	3830781	Come on, how many times does that game have to come out?
3830901	3832282	Just go buy the Taito Collection.
3832822	3836745	And why did they have to steal the name of the, you know, popular dance game?
3837345	3838886	Puzzle Bobble was such a cuter name.
3838946	3839446	I know.
3840247	3840767	Stupids.
3841528	3841868	Alright.
3843109	3846951	Now, if you like to play games an awful lot, you might be trying to set a new record.
3848012	3852275	And Loki, you know, Twin Galaxies, one of these big sites that tracks records, what are they up to?
3852895	3854436	They're up to no good, as usual.
3855637	3858118	What they're doing, actually, they have a couple things going on.
3858138	3860639	The first is they're actually holding a contest.
3861480	3865122	It's called Who's the Toughest Gun in Dodge City of Video Games.
3866298	3883108	and to kind of tie in with everything, there's going to be a bunch of contests being held, kind of demonstrations to see who can get the highest score in like Dig Dug, Donkey Kong, Gorf, Galaxin, Joust, Ms.
3883148	3892753	Pac-Man, Q-Bert and Zookeeper and what they're also doing is they're tying this all into the 2007 Guinness Book of World Records and
3893189	3898994	and actually that Twin Galaxies is going to be tied in with the Guinness Book.
3899014	3900795	So all these records will be going in the Guinness.
3901015	3901696	No Burger Time?
3902096	3902477	No Burger Time.
3902497	3902997	Worthless!
3904959	3906420	So it's kind of funny, though.
3906440	3912805	I had to laugh because the Qbert one, they actually have this one old woman that's going to be competing.
3913646	3916748	Is that Granny Hardcore, whatever her name is?
3916768	3919330	Yeah, it's one that... I can't remember her name.
3919370	3921512	But yeah, I saw it in the email I got from them.
3922102	3923703	Pac-Man Pac-Man
3952517	3955059	Double Dare 3 is actually a Nancy Drew game.
3982014	3983215	Which makes it worse!
3983375	3987718	I wanted Mark Summers... I read Nancy Drew books when I was little.
3988098	3995923	I wanted Mark Summers to have to explain, you know, the slime pit that he had to jump through and then get really freaked out by it because he was obsessive compulsive, right?
3995984	3996224	Remember?
3996444	3999686	We all saw the 2020... Dateline, whatever the hell it was, aired that special.
4000266	4000947	What does he do now?
4000967	4001787	What does Mark Summers do now?
4001828	4002688	He's a producer.
4003008	4006331	He's a host of a show called Unwrapped on Food Network.
4006631	4006831	Okay!
4007974	4008815	I should know that.
4008875	4010156	You used to watch Food Network all the time.
4010176	4011156	He also was a producer.
4011257	4012397	In fact, I actually saw him.
4012638	4015400	What was that show where they would play these massive pranks on people?
4017021	4017581	Candid Camera?
4018081	4019522	Well, no, it wasn't that.
4019562	4021764	It was another one, but he was... Punk'd?
4023345	4024466	I'm Mark Summers.
4025727	4027528	You just got punk'd.
4027748	4032572	Well, they got him to host a show on there where they were destroying this guy's car.
4034091	4038995	and, I mean, they really didn't destroy his car, they destroyed a duplicate of it, but it was pretty funny.
4039055	4041757	Okay, for everybody in chatroom yelling out, what would you do?
4041997	4045099	Okay, hello and welcome to, like, ten years ago, okay?
4045360	4047421	That's not what he's currently doing anymore.
4047922	4050383	I think he, I think the pie pod is long gone.
4051104	4051644	Pie pod.
4051664	4052845	That's fucking sad, I know that.
4052905	4053266	Anyway, um...
4055205	4063032	Last week, big announcement from Game Developers Conference that Nintendo Revolution was going to have Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx games on it.
4063072	4064033	Well, here's the deal.
4064493	4067235	Hudson is saying that, oh, it gets better.
4067896	4074121	CD-ROM 2 CD games are also going to be on the Nintendo next-gen system.
4074201	4078385	So, Snatcher, Night Trap, it might happen.
4079105	4080286	My heart is happy.
4080607	4081948	And what, because the Dracula...
4082679	4087582	whatever, Dracula X, Rondo of Blood, Sapphire, Strider.
4088703	4091785	The one that they ported over to Super Nintendo that was crap on Super Nintendo.
4091885	4096627	It actually was fun as a game, but when you played the original... Yep, it's poop.
4098348	4100570	I brought it on the show one time and played it on the webcam, remember?
4100590	4103371	That was a long time ago.
4103391	4105553	I was back in the three hour live show days.
4106113	4108555	When we could get away with doing stuff like that because nobody was listening.
4109055	4109155	Uh...
4111883	4114204	Loki, what else is going to be cool about the revolution?
4114305	4127372	Well, I don't know if this is cool, and this is just IGN, you know, with their exclusive on what they, I guess, found out is the specs on the up-and-coming revolution system.
4128013	4139400	Basically, they're saying that it's clocked at, the CPU is clocked at about 729 megahertz, which in comparison is not quite twice that...
4140715	4145999	from the Gecko CPU in the GameCube, but pretty close.
4146800	4157128	Also, that the Revolution GPU ATI Hollywood chip is going to be 243 MHz, which the GameCube GPU ran only at 162.
4157188	4162372	Basically, all this together, they said it's about as powerful as a current-gen Xbox.
4164894	4165354	Interesting.
4166615	4167616	I don't know, I mean...
4169195	4169515	I don't know.
4170416	4173338	I'd have to see, because specs don't mean anything when it comes to games.
4174179	4175960	I mean, you have to see what the games look like before.
4176000	4182865	You could put the uber-processor of God in those machines, and it wouldn't matter if the games suck.
4183506	4189851	So it's all about the games, and if that ends up being what the specs really are, Nintendo better put their games where their mouth is.
4189911	4195995	We're all about the games, or what's the surprise, or element of surprise?
4196015	4196856	What was that thing he kept saying?
4196876	4196976	Game?
4197678	4199080	at Game Developers Conference.
4199660	4200902	Games are meant to be one thing.
4201142	4201402	Fun.
4201582	4202423	Fun for everyone.
4202523	4203004	Surprise.
4203024	4203484	What was that thing?
4203504	4204645	He said surprise element.
4204706	4206387	Displacing the scene.
4206447	4209390	I don't remember what the hell the word was.
4209450	4209991	Disrupting.
4210051	4210592	Disruption.
4210732	4211192	Disruption.
4211212	4211713	That was the word.
4212854	4213595	Displacing?
4213635	4214295	Where the hell was my mind?
4214315	4215517	Disruption gaming.
4215537	4218420	I want to play your game!
4218640	4220241	That's like... Really?
4221317	4221757	Thanks for watching!
4242489	4246373	And kudos to Bershaz, who was first in the chatroom to correct us there.
4246413	4249356	There's a slight delay between when we say things when the chatroom hears it.
4249596	4252078	But he was the first to say, or she, sorry, I don't know.
4252279	4257484	Bershaz says the first to say disruptive gaming was the term there.
4258397	4259898	used at the Game Developers Conference.
4260218	4262059	All right, really quickly, we're going to wrap this segment up.
4262099	4265780	We have a couple quick top ten stories that we're going to get to first.
4266301	4269962	And speaking of Japan, we were talking a couple stories in this segment about Japan.
4270402	4275825	We haven't talked a whole lot about what their best-selling games are, but we thought tonight we'd run over their top ten sellers.
4276225	4280807	No surprise there that Final Fantasy XII is at the top of their charts.
4281307	4285651	In their second week, they've now sold over 2 million copies of Final Fantasy XII in Japan.
4285691	4286471	So that's pretty awesome.
4287212	4289734	Also in the top 10, at number 10, Mario Kart DS.
4290134	4299622	At number 9, and I apologize in advance for this horrible pronunciation, Haru Kanaru Toki no Uchi Day 3, Unmei no Mekuyu.
4300022	4301103	And that's by Koei.
4301123	4302264	There's a company that does that.
4303004	4306167	So that must be another one of those Nobunaga Ambition type of games.
4306187	4306347	Yeah.
4307530	4309251	Number 8, Brain Training for Adults.
4309331	4310791	Number 7, English Training.
4311151	4313272	Number 6, Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires.
4313332	4314513	Number 5, Brain Training 2.
4315213	4320275	Number 4, Animal Crossing Wild World in its 18th week on the Japanese charts.
4320655	4321295	2.2 million copies.
4321695	4323836	At number 3, Ace Combat Zero, The Belkan War.
4323916	4327557	Number 2, Pokemon Rangers Diamond and Pearl.
4327897	4330658	And number 1, of course, was Final Fantasy 12 there.
4330718	4331419	So very interesting.
4331439	4331419	1, 2, 3.
4333439	4334720	3 Brain Training games in the top 10 there.
4335967	4337008	And it has not come out here.
4338531	4341014	Alright, now, Loki, you have another top ten of sorts.
4341334	4345220	Top ten games being played on the Xbox 360 or live.
4345941	4348925	I'm kind of questioning the whole live bit of it when you'll find out.
4349604	4352907	First one, of course, being Halo 2 at the top of the list.
4353407	4357131	Number two is Oblivion, which I don't understand how that'd be played on Xbox Live.
4357171	4358732	Is that an April Fool's joke, maybe?
4358852	4364056	Because either it's got to be just counting the time that you're signed in, actually playing the game.
4364096	4364677	It must be that.
4365077	4369221	But in which case, this chart doesn't serve the purpose I thought it did.
4369421	4374165	I thought these charts were supposed to tell us what games people are playing online head-to-head.
4374741	4376502	I don't get it, but whatever.
4376782	4377102	Keep going.
4377423	4380004	Number three, Ghost Recon 3, Advanced Warfighter.
4380464	4381425	Number four, Call of Duty 2.
4383086	4384647	Number five, Fight Night Round 3.
4385547	4387709	Number six, Project Gotham Racing 3.
4388769	4392331	And number seven, Perfect Dark Zero, which is surprising because the game sucks.
4392912	4397554	A lot of people disagree with that statement, just so you know.
4397654	4400236	I didn't like it either, but a lot of people disagree with us.
4400636	4401096	You know what?
4401316	4404298	I'm going back to play the games again all the way through.
4404558	4407299	I will play it, so whatever.
4407319	4408499	I might change my opinion later.
4409800	4413061	Seriously, though, they should be able to jump.
4413141	4420964	Number 8, Battlefield 2 Modern Combat, whether that be the demo or the original Battlefield 2.
4422145	4424966	Number 9, Dead or Alive 4, and number 10, Burnout Revenge.
4425786	4428387	See, I have a hard time believing Burnout Revenge is that far down on the list.
4429285	4430866	When all those games have Xbox LiveAware.
4430886	4431746	It doesn't make any sense to me either.
4432027	4437009	Comment from ChatroomsGK128 says, This is probably ranked by how many games are signed on as LiveAware.
4437209	4437669	Yep, I agree.
4437689	4439470	I think that's the only way this list can be legit.
4440531	4442292	And I apologize if I'm pronouncing this name wrong.
4442532	4448415	Tyrico says that on Oblivion, you have the chat for live so you can get help for quests and stuff.
4448735	4449595	So I guess that's true.
4449675	4453377	I mean, the LiveAware element, you can chat with your friends.
4453897	4456899	For instance, you know your buddy Eric and Mel, right?
4457360	4457521	Yeah.
4457541	4461596	Okay, Mel just got on Xbox Live, and so I was playing Hexic, or, what is it?
4462062	4463322	Yeah, Hexic, I was playing that game earlier.
4463422	4465223	She was sending me all these messages while I was playing.
4465603	4466923	And I was sending her voice messages back.
4466943	4467544	I need to friend her.
4467604	4468784	So you can do the chat things.
4469084	4472245	I need to friend them because I don't have them on my list.
4472305	4474246	I'll tell you where to get their names and all that good stuff.
4474606	4478107	By the way, you can post your names if you want to maybe be our friend.
4478147	4479587	We sometimes friend people randomly.
4479607	4480327	I friend everybody.
4481368	4482988	I'll friend long-time listeners of the show.
4483188	4486889	I don't friend people that come out of the woodwork, but I friend people who are long-time listeners.
4487109	4488670	But then if you annoy me, I'll delete you.
4489639	4491060	But it's on our forums.
4491120	4493902	OrangeLaunchRadio.com and there's on the forums.
4493962	4502189	Speaking of which, Jason, he told me, you know, hey, add me.
4502249	4503330	I sent him a friend request.
4503954	4504274	DarkSakura,
4526252	4530614	We're using it to bring you clips from episodes you may not even be able to get anymore.
4530914	4538116	And this week, I actually went through and everybody on our friends list, I left comments in my space.
4538376	4543338	Actually, I didn't get everybody because some of your pages are really wacky and I couldn't even figure out how to add a comment.
4543378	4545899	So if I couldn't figure it out in five seconds, I didn't comment you.
4545919	4546439	I'm so sorry.
4546499	4547960	Send a message and I'll look at it again.
4548260	4550521	But we're leaving comments with people now.
4551121	4553362	And that took a little while, but it's all good.
4554184	4558086	So if you want to get a comment on your MySpace from Orange Lounge Radio, we'd be happy to do that for you.
4558366	4560667	However, I'm making Jamie or Loki do it next time.
4562087	4565129	It's www.myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
4565189	4566469	We'll have more pictures of the Humvee.
4567169	4569190	We need to get more picture things because we were doing picture things.
4569691	4572992	We need to get you guys to use your art talents because you have much more than I do, that's for sure.
4573752	4574072	All right.
4574392	4580155	Yeah, so add us on the MySpace, myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and other cool things to come to the MySpace eventually.
4581334	4585177	Alright, that's going to do it here for the first part of our podcast.
4585557	4590280	So stay tuned to the podcast and a little later this week will come part number two.
4590960	4595944	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
4596404	4600707	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
