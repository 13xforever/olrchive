487	19079	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19980	22022	Alright, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
22142	27707	This is April 23rd, 2006, our show for tonight, episode number 182.
28108	31110	Kid Whatever from In The Groove is going to be here in just a little bit.
31871	37056	But first, we've got some more news to get to, and Loki's going to start us off with Nintendo Revolution.
37757	39759	Yes, go Revolution.
40299	42201	Anyways, one of the games that's...
44088	46229	Some form of it's coming to the Revolution.
46510	48911	At least that's the rumor according to Famitsu Magazine.
48931	50092	It would be Knights.
50892	54135	Yes, Sega's Knights is going to be making an appearance on the Revolution.
54155	58037	It'll definitely be interesting to play that with the Revolution controller.
59498	60479	Don't know if it's going to be a new game.
60899	61840	Don't know if it's going to be a port.
63020	64021	Do know it's going to be coming.
64421	64802	Squee.
66443	68344	A lot of fans very excited about that.
69084	70105	I think they should make a new game.
70540	74063	I think it'd be cool because it's flying around stuff and I'd really work with the remote.
75284	77146	Or controller.
77586	80949	We want to keep calling it a remote because it looks like a remote but it's a damn controller.
81469	81750	Alright.
82869	111419	also a very popular series coming back officially announced this week on the Xbox 360 Fantasy Star Universe is going to be coming out well we all knew it was coming but Sega has now officially announced it there's going to be an epic story a single player adventure there's going to be of course the online mode as well real time battles where players choose their own strategies kind of different than most MMOs Fantasy Star is like an action based MMO a little more so especially than any other and
111939	117521	Not entirely quite MMOs, more like a Guild Wars type MMO, Instanced Dungeons.
118081	124943	It's basically Diablo 2 in 3D, but don't tell a Phantasy Star fan that, because they might resent that.
124983	127044	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
127064	128924	Diablo 2 is a great game, but that's really what I felt.
128944	133786	When I first played Phantasy Star Online, I was like, this is Diablo 2 in space 3D.
134866	135926	Seriously, that's what it felt like to me.
135946	136867	I don't know, maybe I'm just weird.
138417	139637	Let's see, what's the release date for this?
139697	140117	I'm trying to see.
140137	142678	It was somewhere on here.
143658	145859	Maybe it's not on here, and we just announced it a couple weeks ago, right?
145879	146719	It's in September, isn't it?
146939	149839	We announced it a few weeks ago, and I don't have it in front of me.
149979	150940	Otherwise, I would tell you.
151180	151980	That's right.
152120	153620	Let me do a find for the word September.
153740	155460	No, it's not showing up, so much for that.
156341	159461	So no official release date yet, although it's September.
159481	160761	Hold on.
163404	164065	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
187972	188813	Nope, that didn't come up either.
188853	190995	So they didn't announce the official release date.
191135	192135	But that's on PlayStation 2.
192175	195498	That's the only thing that they had announced on currently.
195658	197339	But I'd imagine it's coming out at the same time.
197919	198259	Makes sense.
198600	203043	But it's coming out on Xbox 360, which is a little bit of a, oh, hey, cool.
203083	203903	It's coming out there too.
204384	205965	So a lot of folks will be picking it out there.
206305	213110	Hopefully not as tricky to get signed up and play as it is with Final Fantasy XI.
213170	213610	Yeah.
214010	216052	I remember Phantasy Star was kind of...
217993	222617	Easy on the original Xbox to sign up and play, so I don't see why the Phantasy Star universe wouldn't be any different.
224358	226761	Alright, moving on, I also have a story here.
227221	228542	This ran on Kotaku.
228582	234368	Apparently there is a lot of buzz around the internet this week about a new Kid Icarus game that's supposed to be happening.
234568	242515	Because there's this artwork circulating around on the internet, and they're going, OMG, finally, Kid Icarus on the revolution, is it finally going to happen?
242655	243096	It is.
244022	248123	I guess it was actually published on a Korean game site that said that this was supposed to be happening.
248143	249024	Well, guess what, guys?
250324	251945	It actually... We lie to you!
252785	255366	Somebody got it from a DeviantArt website.
255386	262308	Some guy made this on DeviantArt, and Kotaku actually links the dude's DeviantArt page, and there it is.
262388	265049	There's the concept art for Kid Icarus Revolution.
265509	269951	So it's not this guy's fault, it's the Korean website's fault that sort of perpetuated the rumor, but...
270191	274053	There are some fools right now who just need to be smacked straight off the face of the internet.
274453	275054	You know what, though?
275134	275514	Come on.
275554	276274	Can you blame them?
276354	277135	Kid Icarus?
277155	282978	Kid Icarus is a beloved... It's a beloved Nintendo franchise for the past, what, 20 years now?
283478	286960	That still has never really seen anything next-gen.
287441	289282	Didn't they have something on Game Boy or something?
289302	290742	They had a Game Boy release.
290842	294084	That's a minor release, too.
294104	295105	It wasn't even a major deal.
295565	298847	So we're left hanging here, guys.
300074	300574	Why is it?
300634	303636	I don't understand why Nintendo does not want to touch this franchise again.
303836	304656	It doesn't make sense to me.
305597	307037	Maybe they think they can't do it justice.
307137	313680	I mean, they have... Wait, what about this flight game that they're doing with Hudson?
314741	316822	You think they might have a cameo?
317682	317862	No.
317982	319963	It's a little far-fetched, but... It is.
320483	322184	Way too far-fetched.
323204	328887	When they're talking about bombing runs and stuff, I don't think you're going to have Kid Icarus doing bombing runs.
330711	330991	No thanks.
331111	331392	I don't know.
331412	333734	The BOA Network had a lot of range when you upgraded it a lot.
334855	335155	All right.
335656	339380	I posted the link there to the DVR on our page because some folks in chat were asking for it.
339400	343624	So if you want to join our chat room, if you're listening live on Sunday night, www.orangelawntradio.com.
343644	344264	Click on chat.
344745	346747	But our chat room is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
346767	347988	You can just pop in there any time.
348028	349009	And there's some lurkers.
349530	351512	Magus, you lurk in there a little bit, don't you?
351752	352172	All the time.
352332	353313	In fact, I'm in there right now.
355269	356169	You are, even though you're here.
356670	358290	I'm just watching myself do nothing.
358390	359531	That's all right.
359571	365273	You're logging what people say about you in chat on what a horrible job you're doing tonight.
365333	365673	I'm teasing.
365693	366234	You're doing great.
366454	371036	And you've told no really bad jokes tonight, which I appreciate, might I say.
371056	371656	Give it time.
371676	372696	Give it time.
372716	373737	We still have half the show to do.
374237	378058	All right, Loki, some Xbox Live news.
378779	380600	Yes, lots of fun stuff.
381200	382520	But first off, demos.
383301	383961	Tiger Woods...
384775	392702	And finally, getting the demo on Xbox Live, as well as Amp 3, the game we gave away last week.
393082	395024	So definitely check those out if you haven't yet.
395665	402771	Of course, the Speed Pack's up there for Project Gotham Racing 3, as well as the more co-op stuff and new cameo downloads as well.
403512	408316	And lots of stuff going to be coming, especially E3 week.
408556	410418	Talking about a demo for FIFA World Series.
411107	413609	Cup Soccer 06, and more stuff like that.
413649	416932	MotoGP 06, or 2006 is supposed to be coming too.
417873	418714	Which looked really cool.
419354	420155	Alright, excellent.
420255	423838	So keep your eyes out on Xbox Live for that and plenty more demos.
423858	425640	We're hoping a lot of good stuff during E3.
426941	429503	It's just me though, does the marketplace need a facelift pretty bad?
430304	432426	It's starting to get a little, it's just too much there.
432526	438051	They need more user, it's not a user friendly system to me.
439125	439965	Custom Gamer Picks
453675	454716	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
477478	479203	We're going to have to filter that.
479483	485017	That's true, because you could just put a big pair of titties right there as your gamer picture and there's no screening process.
485037	485959	They're probably going to have to...
487369	489991	Filter and approve every single custom avatar.
490031	493293	People putting offensive things like, you know, who knows.
494014	496095	The postage stamps a while back.
496176	496596	Remember that?
496636	500178	People were putting like Hitler and things on postage stamps and there was a big no-no.
500479	503741	So I think they might be opening up a huge can of worms we're not prepared for.
503761	507084	Oh yeah, and I think the Ghost Recon Vance Warfighter demo was on there too.
507304	508885	I think that came out a few weeks ago though.
510385	513288	I think there's an offline one now that's available.
513328	515270	I think there was an online one, now there's an offline one.
515410	515810	I think.
516090	516731	Don't quote me on that.
517151	518172	Just going off what I read.
518452	520975	I have to admit, I don't follow a whole lot of the news of that series.
521295	524257	I kind of just go online and try to be surprised when I see stuff.
524818	526559	Yep, GK128 in chat agrees with me.
526599	529082	The new demo is one player, as opposed to multiplayer.
529542	530663	I don't like those multiplayer demos.
530683	534486	I think it's kind of cool, but you should have a demo that you get to pick whether it's multiplayer or not.
535247	536148	It's just my thought.
536912	539734	Alright, well it's been a little while since we've had an interview on the show, right Loki?
540215	540775	A little bit, yeah.
540795	546520	Alright, and we haven't really talked enough about music games tonight, so we should bring on somebody to talk about music games tonight, right Loki?
546761	547041	Hell yeah.
548359	552661	All right, well, we have another special guest on tonight's program, and that person is Kid Whatever.
553021	558304	Music game fans recognize the name Kid Whatever from his contributions to the In the Groove series of games.
558744	564427	If you watch the anime convention circuit, you may have also heard the buzz around his live appearance at SakuraCon last month.
564947	567368	He has a new CD out called Hi, I'm Sorry I'm Late.
567448	571850	I brought some records, and he's here with us tonight to talk about his recent accomplishments.
571950	572871	Kid Whatever, are you there?
573591	573951	I'm here.
574011	574471	How's it going?
574591	575312	Hey, pretty good.
575372	576572	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
576592	577133	How you doing?
577153	577393	Thanks.
578523	579164	I'm tired.
579484	579804	Tired?
579824	580525	What have you been up to?
581145	582086	I've been exhausted.
583647	586589	Non-stop stuff pretty much for the last month or so.
587030	599439	Ever since getting ready for SakuraCon and playing up there, and then came home, got my album released, and then we shot a music video last week, which we just finished.
599579	602321	So it's just been non-stop work, work, work.
602761	603022	Awesome.
603042	605504	Can we check out that music video on your website, kidwhatever.com?
606533	607273	You can, yep.
607733	608053	Awesome.
608613	614115	Well, first, I've got to go back to the past and kind of set the stage here for those that may not recognize your name.
614135	616175	You're involved with the dance game In The Groove, right?
616755	617295	That is correct.
617456	619276	And how did you get hooked up with the In The Groove project?
620596	630418	Kyle Ward, the main music producer, who I'm sure you guys are familiar with, he and I go way, way, way back to just being 19, 20-year-old DDR brats.
630458	630559	Yeah.
633323	648094	When he got hooked up in the game, he just asked me if I wanted to take a shot at making a song for it, and I made While the Record Spins, and they put that on the test machine up in Seattle, and everybody loved it, so just kept going.
648114	648834	We just ran with it.
649535	652997	Now, While the Record Spins isn't really credited to Kid Whatever, though, right?
653017	657120	So you use multiple... Yeah, I have used a few different names for the game.
657160	661083	It's just, you know, if I want to explore a different kind of sound or something, I'll just...
662293	663654	It's purposefully to confuse you.
677330	677950	Well, it worked.
678010	678811	Congratulations.
679391	679771	Thank you.
679791	680292	All right.
680472	683734	Well, I noticed now you said in there that you and Kyle met through DDR.
683774	686055	So you guys were a fan of music games before In the Groove?
686635	687076	Oh, yeah.
687416	687816	Way back.
687836	688116	Yep.
688556	689877	So what do you think about all that?
689897	693819	I know this is a touchy subject, but I'm kind of curious what you think about all that controversy going back and forth.
693879	696001	Is it just stay far away from it or...
696989	702510	As far as what the... Like, you know, the whole DDR in the groove.
702770	706411	You know, it kind of polarizes the fan base and all that stuff.
706491	708011	Lawsuit and all that stuff.
709131	711652	I don't really know any details about the lawsuits.
711752	713172	I can't really talk about that.
713352	717593	But, you know, there's room for both games, honestly.
717693	718433	I love them both.
718553	721934	They both are good in different ways.
722014	723614	So I don't really see the point of
724693	726354	You know, DDR versus In The Groove.
726434	727815	I think there's room for both games.
728575	729116	Love them both.
729616	730196	Embrace them.
730696	731097	There you go.
731417	736140	Well, obviously people in the community feel the same because In The Groove 3 was announced not that long ago, right?
737540	738381	Uh, you know, I don't know.
739361	742783	I'm pretty sure they had announced it at some arcade thing that they were going to do In The Groove 3, so...
746023	751085	There's a couple things that I've done.
751405	762567	I want to do some more but we haven't really had much time to talk with that.
762627	770389	Kyle and I have both been very busy with a lot of other things so hopefully pretty soon we'll get a chance to meet up and talk about that stuff.
770729	772610	Everything's still in the very early stages then?
774453	777074	I don't know, as far as my contribution, yeah.
777394	778415	Okay, okay.
778895	785297	Well, now, outside of the In The Groove series, you played SakuraCon recently, and there was like, what, 2,000 people there?
785357	786738	How did you get involved with that?
788338	800323	A friend mentioned that SakuraCon was going on, and they were going to have a dance, and I just decided I wanted to DJ at it, and it was just pestering everybody I knew until I finally got to go up there and meet with them, and
801038	804120	They said, yeah, and they let me do it, and it was just awesome.
804180	805000	It was so great.
805040	807021	I've never played for that big of a crowd.
807641	816846	You know, when I do shows here in Portland at home, there's maybe 50, maybe 100 people, and that was just incredible to see 2,000 people dancing to my stuff.
816866	817406	It was great.
817686	820307	So do you plan on doing more of these anime shows in the future?
820407	823449	Like, is this going to be maybe a thing for you, traveling the convention circuit, or...?
824352	824973	I don't know yet.
825413	826114	I'd like to.
826414	831600	I just don't really, like this one being here in the northwest, I was able to make connections pretty easily.
832561	835504	But outside of that, I don't really know anybody, so...
837202	840545	I don't know, if you're out there, send me an email and let's talk about it.
840625	841885	I'd love to play more of them.
842186	842706	Alright, awesome.
842726	845268	Well, let's give them a sample right now of whatever it sounds like.
845288	846289	We're going to play a track.
846729	854955	This song was included in In The Groove 1, which is available right now for PlayStation 2, as well as still some arcades out there that haven't upgraded to In The Groove 2 yet.
854995	857177	But I believe this song carried over into In The Groove 2.
857777	859879	And then now this is out on PC as well, right?
860039	860419	In The Groove?
861140	862641	Or it's coming out or just came out?
863308	863848	I'm not sure.
864689	865350	I think it came out.
865490	866931	I think it just recently came out.
866951	868753	Well, here it is, one of the tracks from the games.
869573	872816	I think I like that sound by Kid Whatever here on Orange Lounge Radio.
887789	888089	Yeah.
889590	889910	Yeah.
891412	891632	Yeah.
893214	893554	Yeah!
895016	895396	Yeah!
896857	897238	Yeah!
898679	898959	Yeah!
898979	899059	Yeah!
900500	900821	Yeah!
900961	901281	Yeah!
901401	901741	Yeah!
901841	902182	Yeah!
902302	902622	Yeah!
902722	903803	I think I like how that sounds!
904143	904464	Yeah!
904544	905625	I think I like how that sounds!
905965	906285	Yeah!
906365	907466	I think I like how that sounds!
907787	908107	Yeah!
908247	908567	Yeah!
908707	909008	Yeah!
909148	909448	Yeah!
909608	909908	Yeah!
909928	911109	I think I like how that sounds!
911450	911770	Yeah!
911850	912931	I think I like how that sounds!
913271	913592	Yeah!
913672	914753	I think I like how that sounds!
922486	922930	DarkSakura
1024528	1024871	DJ Ranma
1062609	1064610	I think I like that sound
1082915	1083235	Right on.
1084615	1087316	You have a new CD out called Hi, I'm Sorry I'm Late.
1087356	1088297	I brought some records.
1088597	1090617	First, I have to know, where's the title come from?
1090697	1091697	It's a very unique title.
1092718	1098439	The title came from... I feel like I should have had an album out a long time ago.
1099700	1108862	And there's been a couple of plans in the works to put out like in the groove soundtrack CDs or CDs with my songs that are in the game.
1109202	1111603	And all of those have fallen through repeatedly.
1112259	1116662	So I finally decided, you know what, I'm just going to do it myself.
1116782	1125967	So it's an apology, and I hope everybody will forgive me for not having something out sooner, and we can rock out together.
1126348	1126688	Awesome.
1126728	1134012	Now I was going to ask, do you think that the success of your songs in the In The Groove game is what enabled you to put together this CD?
1135273	1138095	I think I probably would have done it anyway, even if it wasn't for the video game.
1140973	1143795	What types of ways have you been marketing this CD out there?
1144555	1145616	Mostly just word of mouth.
1145676	1147437	That's really all I can do at this point.
1148358	1148898	It's hard.
1149619	1160466	It's really difficult when there's so many people who are making electronic music and putting it on the internet that people just kind of have stopped paying attention.
1160546	1167992	So just word of mouth, message boards, email lists, just telling everybody that I possibly can, hey, come check out my stuff.
1169127	1173071	And we just made a music video, so hopefully that'll help a little bit too What's the music video for?
1173671	1179536	It's for the song Disco Express And how did you come up with the concept for the music video?
1179577	1180557	What'd you guys do for it?
1181458	1189646	I had me and about four friends over here And we just decided to basically make jackasses out of ourselves That's the way to do it, fun
1190560	1193123	There was definitely an idea and it all kind of came together at the last minute.
1193143	1195526	I think we spent five days on it total from concept to final edit.
1208126	1208887	Yeah, you should check it out.
1208927	1211168	It's on my website at kidwhatever.com Pretty much non-stop Tetris BS.
1211188	1211509	Right on it.
1235006	1238889	It's the first time since I was like 9 or 10 that Tetris has taken over my life.
1239049	1247415	So I've been hanging out on the internet a little bit, hanging out down at Backspace, a little internet cafe here in Portland, and kicking everybody's ass.
1248236	1252339	Alright, so are you willing to give out your friend code over on kidwhatever.com?
1253220	1254621	Oh yeah, I should totally put that up.
1254981	1255721	Alright, right on.
1257022	1257583	Check that out.
1258023	1261586	Anything else, any other projects or live shows coming up soon that you want to plug?
1262769	1265009	Nothing yet, just trying to plan a couple things.
1265069	1269790	Probably going to have a CD launch party here next month in Portland, but it's still too early to say.
1269930	1277492	But I definitely want to DJ and want to book some more gigs, so just keep watching on my website and I'll announce stuff as soon as I've got it all sorted out.
1278092	1278752	Alright, awesome.
1278772	1282613	So keep an eye on Kid Whatever over at www.kidwhatever.com.
1282973	1284713	Hey, thanks so much for being on the program tonight.
1284733	1285613	We really appreciate it.
1286113	1286453	No problem.
1286473	1287274	Thanks for having me on, Rob.
1287414	1288734	Alright, best of luck to you with your CD.
1289234	1289434	Thanks.
1290814	1291594	That was awesome.
1291854	1292875	I'm glad he can come on.
1293055	1308059	Anyways, the next story we have is coming from... It's actually talking about the Major League Gaming finally coming to the USA Network, which is interesting because I've never heard of Major League Gaming, but it should be cool.
1308520	1319243	Anyways, Wall Street Journal was reporting that they basically have signed a deal to do a series of seven hour-long shows that are going to be airing on Saturday morning starting this fall.
1320013	1328158	Featuring competitions between gamers ranging from really serious games from Halo 2 and Super Smash Bros.
1329659	1334603	That should be interesting because I remember they tried something like this with Arena on G4.
1335223	1339526	I don't know, it was an okay show, but I don't know.
1340386	1342688	Well, you see, the problem with that show is that it was on G4.
1344332	1346432	Have you watched G4 lately?
1346492	1347093	No, actually no.
1347173	1349793	It was old school G4.
1350613	1351974	It was okay.
1352014	1355134	It was actually one of the better shows on the network probably.
1357395	1360575	Like most things on G4, it kind of went downhill as time went on.
1361115	1362276	I sat today.
1362476	1365756	I actually flipped to G4 to see if there was anything on.
1366536	1369117	I flipped ahead seven hours in advance.
1369677	1374098	I would have had to wait seven hours before I actually saw any programming that had anything to do with games.
1375165	1376065	That's how bad it's gotten.
1376085	1377326	Or is it Star Trek 2.0 all day?
1377626	1384448	Star Trek Next Generation, Fastlane, Brainiac, Banzai.
1385028	1386388	You know what they should do during E3?
1386448	1390049	Forget protesting outside the convention center.
1390089	1392590	People should be protesting outside G4's booth.
1393310	1394990	Bring back gaming television.
1395290	1396591	That's what people should be doing.
1397111	1399772	And it's all in the same patterns MTV.
1400152	1401972	You know, if G4's booth... Same exact patterns.
1402012	1404653	Yeah, but at least MTV stuff, they kind of have, you know,
1405093	1406996	Some music related stuff.
1407056	1408478	It's sort of music related.
1408498	1410861	They'll have music artists doing shows and stuff like that.
1411782	1413864	This has nothing to do with anything.
1414245	1415186	This is Star Trek.
1416328	1417509	I have a word of advice, kiddies.
1418931	1423617	If G4's booth is in the same place it was at last year, you don't have to have a badge to get there.
1424739	1428662	because it's in the lobby and it's even before the place where you pick up your badge holders.
1429042	1435826	So you could go and if you wanted to, I don't know, protest, hold up a few signs where the cameras are, let them know what you think, what's going on.
1436366	1436867	You could be there.
1437267	1438187	Rabble, rabble, rabble.
1438247	1438568	Exactly.
1438588	1441630	If you want to cause some rabble, just saying, not that I'm encouraging it, but I'm just saying.
1442130	1446773	If you wanted to exercise your free speech and protest right and gather right, you could do it.
1447605	1448225	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1464177	1468821	Anyway, moving on to another story here.
1469621	1479208	The official Nintendo magazine might be hinting a little bit at when they're going to be actually putting out the Nintendo Revolution.
1480329	1486033	An upcoming issue of the official Nintendo magazine divulges info on Sega's upcoming Revolution games.
1486713	1495800	The article also promises a look at Activision's big project, which I assume is probably the Tony Hawk game, and Ubisoft's groundbreaking revolution title.
1496181	1501985	Another page seems to hint at the finalized date of the release for the revolution, 27th of October.
1502505	1508290	This, of course, would line up with the whole we're going to launch before Thanksgiving comment, although that should be more of a duh because
1508652	1511655	Of course, your console's got to launch before Thanksgiving if you want it to be successful.
1512195	1515178	So, 27th of October, sound reasonable?
1515338	1516098	Sound a little early?
1516459	1516899	What do you think?
1517419	1518020	Sounds about right.
1518761	1519141	We'll see.
1519861	1520482	Time will tell.
1520722	1522884	Otherwise, this is just kind of another big question mark.
1523885	1524986	Loki, what else you got?
1526227	1526867	Ah, yes.
1527768	1530771	Gotta love when people cause violence over video games.
1531531	1535895	Um, actually, in, uh, Nagasaki, um,
1536624	1540827	They basically had two teenage brothers fighting over a video game console.
1541107	1542488	One of them ended up dead.
1543088	1545689	Two enter, one leaves with the console.
1546150	1556116	But anyway, seriously enough, close to midnight, apparently two siblings, one 13-year-old and one 15-year-old, fought at home about putting away the video game console.
1556636	1563120	Young brother was punched and kicked repeatedly until he was unconscious and died later in the hospital.
1565291	1571817	First World of Warcraft and now video game consoles When will the tragedy end?
1571978	1573019	Where was their parents?
1573999	1582948	I'm just waiting for the revolution to come out When you actually will be able to use the revmotes to beat them into submission There can be only one
1584505	1595771	You know, stories about stupid people like that that kill other people over gaming systems make us really mad and get us angsty and that means it's time to bring on the anthem for the FUs of the week.
1608538	1612980	DarkSakura no esta aqui tonight so Loki, you gotta start us off tonight.
1614897	1644129	I dislike Rockstar and their lack of programming ability in Grand Theft Auto or at least lazy programming that's in there I shouldn't have to find out later, six months later while enjoying the really wonderful single player game in Grand Theft Auto that the multiplayer does not work correctly especially the multiplayer in teams because you don't want to try it out that fucking sucks and really more attention should be brought to this type of thing because we've seen it with San Andreas and how they left in the hot coffee stuff
1644574	1648636	And now they're just leaving out parts of code for, you know, the multiplayer.
1649136	1651077	Fucking release complete games.
1651217	1652457	Stop patching your games.
1652557	1655559	Stop releasing, you know, stuff that's not finished and not working.
1655999	1661541	I'm sick and tired of goddamn game publishers out there just dropping the ball on the stuff saying, Hey, you know what?
1661821	1662202	Who cares?
1662222	1663082	We'll fix it later.
1665414	1673959	My AFU of the week goes to the cunt that broke into my car sometime over the week and that's the third time now since I've lived in this apartment complex my car has been broken into.
1674559	1680062	The good news is that this time the alarm scared him off because the first time I was like, okay, whatever, cars get broken into.
1680082	1682743	The second time I was like, okay, I'm getting an alarm on this fucker, seriously.
1683264	1683884	This time...
1684484	1686245	They broke the window and that was it.
1686466	1689828	They didn't even bother to take the radio or anything because the alarm obviously scared them off.
1689848	1691869	So I hope you learned your lesson, you stupid thief.
1692330	1697893	Why do people feel the need to steal things from out of my car right in front of my own damn house?
1698754	1700655	It's not like I live in that ghetto of an area.
1700695	1701856	It's actually kind of nice over here.
1702156	1704558	It's just the problem is the other side of the freeway is where the ghetto is.
1704858	1706740	So I think they all come over here to break into our cars.
1707240	1710862	And seriously, I call the apartment complex to kind of complain, like what the hell is security doing?
1710902	1711663	And they're just like...
1712143	1714865	Well, it's just part of living in Sacramento.
1715906	1719168	It's like, okay, I've lived in Sacramento, bitch, my whole life.
1719988	1721909	And I've never had my car broken into until I lived here.
1721950	1728194	So, needless to say, Orange Lounge Radio Studio 4 in October because I'll be moving out of this place.
1728234	1728734	Thank you very much.
1728754	1730915	And it's a good thing they haven't broken in here yet.
1731556	1732356	Try to steal something.
1732957	1733897	Like the equipment.
1733917	1735798	Can you imagine if the Orange Lounge Radio equipment got stolen?
1737159	1737920	Wouldn't that be something else?
1739341	1741402	Andrew, you're FU of the week.
1741852	1742234	All right.
1742996	1744641	This has been holding out for a long time.
1744681	1745564	Well, maybe a week.
1746145	1746486	Maybe a week.
1746507	1747068	That's a long time.
1748031	1748312	Okay.
1748653	1749496	FU to these...
1750140	1753621	Just masses of people who are just overreacting.
1753941	1764864	Now, if you go to GameFacts.com, you'll notice that Cinez kind of changed the logo, changed the design of the site around to match more with their sister site of GameSpot.
1765384	1767765	Now, we have all sorts of people on the forum.
1767805	1768365	Did they really?
1768405	1769145	I haven't seen yet.
1769185	1769886	Oh, I'm going to look.
1770226	1772846	Yeah, they are changing things around like that.
1773847	1777948	And they have a nice little GameSpot logo piggybacking on the GameFacts logo.
1778713	1788638	and for such a minor cosmetic change, people are freaking out left and right, saying that, uh, basically... It's just because it's another reminder that they sold out to the man.
1789279	1806828	Well, it was that or have the site go under, but there are just people just freaking out over this, over what's just a cosmetic change, saying, soul, a site is gone, and now that the administrators are offering add-on premium services...
1807216	1810663	They say, oh my god, now the entire site is going to pay.
1811164	1813630	Seriously, fucking chill out.
1814391	1816355	What is there is gonna be free.
1817361	1819563	What is new might be paid.
1819683	1821824	Okay, I have to play Devil's Advocate for a minute here.
1822524	1824005	I'm saying I personally feel this way.
1824025	1824786	Here's Devil's Advocate.
1825186	1832071	Because this is mostly a user content site, is that why people are maybe a little miffed at this whole thing with the GameSpot logo?
1832091	1833452	Because I wrote that back.
1833552	1834993	I don't want GameSpot's name attached to it.
1835173	1837134	Only because they can't read.
1838555	1842958	All of the user-submitted stuff is copyrighted by that user.
1843738	1846160	GameSpot CNET has to talk to them.
1847270	1857357	and have them sell their FAQ to CNET for them to have it on a premium contest system.
1857417	1859759	They gave it, but they still have the copyright over it.
1860219	1862661	Everything that is free will stay free.
1863221	1864943	So people just need to shut the fuck up.
1865763	1867604	It's just a cosmetic chain.
1867745	1868905	It's nothing more than that.
1869386	1869886	Seriously.
1870186	1870546	Chill.
1871267	1873669	Alright, you can address those cards and letters too.
1873689	1874970	What's your name over on the GameFAQ forum?
1875770	1876431	The 23rd Megas.
1876451	1876771	There you go.
1878174	1879896	Are you a mod over there?
1880497	1884542	I applied to be a mod, got rejected, had sort of a user map issue.
1885443	1886424	Why did they reject you?
1886784	1888026	I had a user map issue.
1888106	1891130	I was sort of logging in from work and my user map was huge.
1891610	1893853	I didn't think it was exactly secure.
1895029	1895249	Oh, please.
1895269	1896390	At least that was the reason they gave you that.
1896410	1898110	Would it help if we wrote a letter endorsing you?
1898130	1898471	No.
1898491	1899031	Would that help?
1899191	1899371	No.
1899391	1901352	Oh, that might hurt you, because we're a no-name site?
1901572	1904073	Why would you want to mod GameFAQs, to be honest?
1904633	1904973	I don't know.
1905053	1905934	I've been there for, like, five years.
1905954	1908555	They have pretty big message forums, and, you know, you might make friends there.
1908755	1912797	Yeah, but the message forums is, like... That's almost, like, MySpace-ish.
1912817	1913057	They're...
1914173	1915154	Okay, okay, okay.
1915194	1920057	There are parts that are pretty goddamn dumb, but you can find little nuggets of intelligence there somewhere.
1920237	1920577	You know what?
1921318	1925701	I bet people try to find a game on there that's like really old school, like on an Atari 20s.
1925981	1929363	Like, hey, let's all go meet on the Keystone Capers forums.
1929623	1930164	People do that.
1930304	1930924	I have done that.
1931044	1932165	I have a secret board.
1933666	1936208	Well, it's not so secret anymore, but I don't want to say it on the air.
1936988	1937929	But people have done that.
1937949	1939470	I think I know what it is because you told me before.
1940030	1940571	I told you.
1940611	1941051	I'll be nice.
1941111	1942152	I'm not telling anyone else.
1942352	1942792	I'll be nice.
1944193	1946654	But seriously, you can find some intelligence on there.
1946754	1955798	Obviously, not as often on places like Random Insanity, but occasionally on current events on some of the secret boards, you can find a lot of good content.
1956959	1957219	All right.
1957819	1959860	But people are just freaking out over nothing, I think.
1960421	1961061	All right, there you have it.
1961081	1963042	All right, views of the week, boys and girls.
1963362	1964903	Take them or leave them.
1964963	1965403	Moving on.
1967233	1968174	There's another list.
1968434	1969535	I brought a top 10 list.
1969575	1973738	Now I've got a top 100 list coming from Next Generation Reports.
1973778	1977061	That's next-gen.biz.
1977441	1984366	Develop Magazine mentioned what the top 100 development studios are.
1984586	1985627	Man, did they list them all.
1985647	1992212	It starts off with 100 is Hudson, 99 Magic Pockets, and all the way through.
1993313	1993653	Let's see.
1993873	1995114	Finally, we get to the top 10.
1996512	1999931	at some point here, and let me see if I can get to the top 10 real quickly here.
2001360	2004862	10.
2003141	2004862	Sony London Studios 9.
2006243	2007504	Traveler's Tales 8.
2008944	2011846	EA Redwood Shores 7.

2022632	2024112	Pandemic Studios 1.
2024393	2025013	EA Canada
2029395	2031076	was named as the number one development studio.
2031496	2034138	What the criteria were, I'm not quite sure here.
2034158	2037800	Let me see if I can check that out here on the beginning of the articles.
2038000	2038700	I'm very curious.
2038940	2042682	How did they determine what was the 100 here?
2044203	2044723	Let's see.
2046484	2050726	It's saying that Develop is a definitive success game studio.
2050746	2053308	It's ranked in terms of their UK sales.
2054328	2054808	Interesting.
2055749	2055989	All right.
2056926	2058167	I'll check that out if you want to.
2058387	2059888	That's from Develop Magazine.
2060268	2062410	Lists always sure to cause controversy there.
2064311	2065232	Comments from our chatroom.
2065272	2068374	HitStun says, no treasure, that list fails.
2070835	2071356	Point taken.
2072336	2072617	Alright.
2073657	2074118	Moving on.
2075378	2076199	Loki, what do you got for us?
2077160	2077940	Another list.
2078561	2079641	This time it's a good list.
2079781	2082923	It's a list of the games that Capcom's going to have playable at E3.
2083084	2083484	Goody goody.
2084685	2086686	Starting off with PlayStation 2, we have Okami.
2087383	2089724	Finally, which I think was playable last year too.
2089744	2091165	Yeah, I want to say it was shown last year too.
2091645	2093586	God Hand, which looks pretty cool.
2093986	2095646	Street Fighter Alpha Anthology.
2096807	2097627	Yeah, another collection.
2099088	2101649	On the 360, Lost Planet and Dead Rising.
2101989	2103550	Hell yeah, Dead Rising is going to be awesome.
2104530	2108312	PSP, Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins and Monster Hunter Freedom.
2109752	2111333	Surprisingly missing would be the
2112409	2119490	Powerstone Collection, and the Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded, and the Capcom Puzzle Collection.
2121191	2131653	DS, Mega Man ZX, and Game Boy Advance, Mega Man Battle Network 6, Psybeast Gregor, and Psybeast Falzar are the two games that they're going to have for that.
2134073	2136174	Comments from our chatroom over at OrangeSoundsRadio.com.
2136194	2138074	I like this nickname, Control-Alt-Effed.
2139238	2143339	says, Capcom, home to the endless Mega Man game sequels.
2143439	2145779	And DJ PooEater follows up with Mega Man XXX.
2148960	2149800	That's true.
2149880	2151481	Capcom has done a lot of Mega Man.
2151521	2154181	Where the hell is my Mega Man Legends sequels?
2154621	2155641	Yeah, seriously.
2156222	2157202	That was a good series.
2157702	2162783	That would be, you know, hey, if you don't want to continue it on with the, you know, PS2 or whatever, PSP,
2163632	2165132	Bring it on the revolution or something.
2165173	2166513	Hell, remake the first game.
2166853	2167413	Make it bigger.
2168033	2171975	Actually, I've heard rumors that ZX is going to have a couple of ties to the Legend series.
2172275	2173995	I'm not sure if those are confirmed or not.
2174295	2179917	No, Mega Man Z was last year's DS title.
2180377	2182978	I think it was just another side-scroller game.
2183058	2186039	Dance Cook in our chatroom says, Needs more Phoenix Wright.
2187140	2187420	Yes.
2187780	2191401	Actually, they are translating the Phoenix Wright sequels.
2192399	2220642	but for mobile phone however it would not be too hard for people who are into say ROM hacking to take the translated scripts for the mobile versions and insert them into the Japanese GBA games so we'll have to see how that turns out well that's a lot of game I never got into Phoenix Wright Phoenix Wright they're just sold out right now that's all they're making more
2221044	2229933	Did I mention that they were making the tentative date for the DDR Mario Mix was in May, May 17th?
2231795	2233757	What, for the new Mario Mix?
2233937	2237981	Well, it's not new, but it's being brought back out because it's been sold out since October.
2238542	2240064	Yeah, I think you said May 17th or something.
2241165	2242446	I don't know where the hell you got that from, though.
2245097	2248099	I think Roz in chat is pissed because I called her Dance Cook.
2248599	2249660	Look, you changed your nickname.
2249680	2252262	That's what I'm going to credit your comments to, so just be careful.
2255204	2259547	If you change your nickname to I'm Stupid, I'm going to say, Hey, I'm Stupid in chat says this.
2260307	2264490	All right.
2264630	2266211	Something I ought to try.
2266351	2272796	Unless you change your nickname to something derogatory about myself or Loki or DarkSakura, then I just won't read your damn comments at all.
2273156	2273416	Damn it.
2274555	2275324	So, got you there.
2276334	2277895	Moving on, another story here.
2277995	2280477	Movie, movie, movie madness tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.
2280497	2286122	Of course, we talked about Silent Hill in the first half, and Roger Avery played a big part of the Silent Hill script there.
2286502	2286983	Guess what?
2287063	2289925	He's also going to be writing Driver.
2290285	2292547	And not only is he writing it, he's directing it.
2292587	2301455	This, of course, Driver, the big Atari franchise, which I remember most of all from Driver 3 because it was so god-awful.
2301835	2305218	And I'm kind of surprised that they're actually making a movie out of this, but whatever.
2305238	2305518	I hope they do.
2305578	2307319	I hope the actors have bad AIs.
2308339	2311840	They're like, can't figure their way around walls, you know, having trouble.
2311880	2313200	Lots of polygon clipping in the movie?
2313341	2315181	Shooting through cars, you know.
2315241	2315801	That'll be fun.
2316522	2317002	What do you think?
2317362	2325204	Will the connection to Silent Hill, which was a pretty good gaming movie, you think that's going to help this, or nothing is going to save this franchise?
2325224	2329846	I think, to be honest, okay, he's a good writer, and it should be good.
2329986	2333287	I don't know, I have to admit, even though I like Silent Hill, the dialogue...
2335262	2338623	Well, neither did Fast and the Furious and it sold.
2364765	2365045	TheWheelMan
2395111	2395731	Exactly.
2396672	2399453	Like this title coming to Japanese arcades.
2400534	2415902	Basically, part of Japanese biggest English school, Nova, they basically teamed up with Konami to bring this English learning game that's going to be coming to arcades.
2417503	2419584	Titled Study Abroad by Gaming.
2421681	2423663	So it's going to be really interesting.
2424223	2429847	Basically a bunch of mini-games that are going to be taking you through language exercises and stuff like that.
2431788	2438213	To be honest, I wouldn't think of learning another language as my preferred arcade game when I go to an arcade, but then again...
2440134	2440754	I'm not Japanese.
2441134	2443815	I hope I'm not the only one who just sees the irony in that.
2444556	2454699	A company in the past known for very bad translations of games, say, I Feel Asleep, is teaching Japanese kids to learn English.
2455539	2456380	How's that gonna work?
2458841	2459961	The truck have started to move.
2460381	2461161	Are you in joy?
2462842	2468364	I hope they've really put some polish into it, because I think Konami's gonna need it in this case.
2468956	2469196	Sqeenix
2489741	2493424	Square Enix, and Taito, of course, they've been coming together lately.
2493484	2497307	They're also going to be launching a music and film enterprise.
2498388	2507695	What happens is that they came together with Faith Inc., which is a digital content solutions provider, and they're going to be coming together to form Brave Inc.,
2508015	2519660	They're going to be investing a total of 80 million yen in the startup, 10% coming from Squeenix, 30% from Taito, and Faith going to contribute the other 60% there.
2520701	2525223	Brave is going to be working with ringtones, downloadable karaoke tracks.
2525243	2530465	They're also going to work with music and movie studios to produce and fund their own projects and develop...
2531305	2534526	Develop user communities around those movies and recording artists.
2535486	2541347	The new company will start up operations at the end of the month, and all the earnings will be reported under Faith Inc.
2541407	2548969	So kind of interesting there that they're going to be working a little more with music and film, so possible tie-ins to later Squeenix titles.
2549109	2549969	Who knows?
2550549	2550869	Who knows?
2551689	2555550	Kind of a little blip, but that might turn into something big a little later on, so I thought we'd mention it.
2556710	2558671	Loki, another movie piece.
2559031	2559291	Yes.
2560009	2567975	Now, Silent Hill came out this week in the theaters, but that's not the only movie that came out that was Silent Hill.
2568035	2572899	Silent Hill No Escape has actually been developed for a while now.
2572959	2577303	It's an all-CG movie that's been done by a fan.
2578103	2581386	I actually got to watch a little bit of this, and it's actually pretty good.
2581886	2582647	It's Pyramid Head in it.
2583596	2584558	I haven't gotten that far yet.
2584818	2585680	So, I don't know.
2586701	2587843	Thumb wavering down.
2588003	2588684	Better be.
2589365	2591128	But anyways, it's definitely worth checking out.
2591228	2592089	It's free.
2592990	2599300	If you're interested in checking out, they actually have a torrent for the DVD image so you can burn it to a DVD and watch it.
2599938	2621188	and it's it's a long movie it's about two hours long um some of the animation is a little rough but it's definitely Silent Hill so check it out noescape.rateofinjury.com and check it out there um they have a torrent um he's talking about actually that's not like using the game to make movies right or what do they call it red versus blue stuff no this is a
2623453	2625515	A total CG movie that's been done.
2625535	2626616	That's pretty hardcore.
2626636	2631800	Talk about a lot of time going into it.
2632361	2633842	Definitely worth checking out.
2634302	2639366	Granted, it may not be the greatest movie, but it's still worth checking out.
2641548	2642509	Definitely look into that.
2643210	2645892	YouWillBowToMe wants to know, is the dialogue better in this?
2647874	2650616	It's actually, from what I've seen so far, it's been silent.
2651889	2653251	Oh, so it's not just a clever name.
2653852	2655514	It's actually kind of a silent movie.
2656916	2659159	But I think there is dialogue later on.
2659219	2662483	But it is kind of very creepy-ish.
2663144	2665027	I mean, you've got to check it out.
2665568	2665788	All right.
2667654	2674938	Some would say this woman is part CG, but Angelina Jolie has signed on to star as Lara Croft in Tomb Raider 3.
2697929	2700930	That baby fat she's gonna get after having the kid.
2701450	2705631	And she's gonna get back into those tights and sign up for Tomb Raider 3.
2705671	2709373	A little bit surprising is Tomb Raider 2 didn't do super good.
2709473	2710133	I mean, it did okay.
2710513	2711393	It didn't do super good.
2711493	2714094	So, a little surprising, but it's happening.
2714834	2717735	And that is the sound of them jumping on the bandwagon.
2718473	2721414	Let the franchise die, please.
2722015	2725016	I thought that was the sound of 14 and 15-year-old boys everywhere.
2725036	2726577	Give the fans what we've been asking for.
2726957	2730058	Hard R, Tomb Raider, lots of nudity.
2730679	2731079	Bring it.
2731219	2731539	Do it.
2732339	2733640	You already know she'll do topless.
2734300	2735241	She'll do topless.
2736181	2737282	She'll do full frontal, too.
2737522	2737982	That's right.
2738002	2738562	Gia.
2738582	2740523	Go ahead, Gia.
2740543	2742384	Will she do full frontal after she's had the baby, though?
2742404	2743184	I don't know.
2743845	2744645	I don't know if you want to see that.
2744665	2745325	That's all right.
2745345	2746586	That's why CG was invented.
2748328	2750289	SioRam says let her die, she already died in one of her games.
2776880	2778340	I think more than one game, to be honest.
2778820	2781121	Yeah, but in the whole game it consisted of flashbacks.
2782301	2784462	At least from what I understand, I've never played that piece of crap.
2784802	2788223	Color of Sakura Sky, since when has a video game movie ever been good?
2789003	2789563	Silent Hill.
2789623	2790223	Silent Hill?
2790263	2793504	Silent Hill was good, I wouldn't say it was great, but it was good.
2794024	2803046	If you're going to ask me when has a video game movie ever been great, I'll probably say, I'll have to really rack my brain on that one if I can even think of one, but Silent Hill was good, I just don't know about, you know, great.
2804284	2804504	All right.
2806505	2806945	Moving on.
2808786	2809006	Loki.
2809566	2809846	Yes.
2810826	2814788	As I mentioned earlier, one of the games coming to the Revolution is Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
2815328	2819389	And actually, not only the Revolution, but pretty much every other system out there.
2820890	2827012	One of the things, though, if you did happen to pick up the May issue of Game Informer, you actually got to see some pictures of it.
2827192	2827852	And it looks pretty cool.
2828232	2830253	They've got some of the characters they featured previously.
2830703	2839786	Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America, Thor, Doctor Strange, and Ghost Rider, and Silver Surfer and Letra are going to be some of the playable characters.
2839826	2849989	Basically, this game is going to kind of be very similar to the X-Men Legends franchise, except this time, of course, spanning a little bit beyond the X-Men series.
2850249	2851689	So we're talking Dungeon Crawler here?
2852309	2853550	So, yeah, basically.
2853750	2854750	And it looks pretty cool.
2854770	2856470	It's kind of cel-shaded.
2857631	2858211	I don't know.
2858584	2860186	It should be very similar to the other games.
2860206	2863030	The other games were pretty good, so worth checking out.
2863070	2863410	Might be at E3.
2866880	2868301	Uh, let's see, one more thing.
2868321	2869442	I don't know if this will be at E3.
2869462	2870563	It seems a little early for this.
2870623	2875386	But, LucasArts is developing a game based around Darth Vader.
2876066	2877347	Hmm, that should be interesting there.
2877908	2880930	Uh, they're going to be, uh, let's see, uh, what's going on here?
2880970	2882090	A Star Wars game.
2882951	2887194	Uh, they outlined a new storyline that delved deeper into Darth Vader's history.
2887294	2891657	So maybe, uh, to explain a little bit about what happened in that gap there between 3 and 4.
2892497	2892878	No!
2892958	2894759	Will there be a scene with... No!
2894859	2894979	No!
2897898	2901300	Press the A button to shout NO!
2902281	2903122	God, we're stupid.
2903242	2903562	Alright.
2903762	2906824	LucasArts just needs to make another Samamax game that I'll buy from him.
2908225	2910186	How about they go back to some of that old school PC stuff?
2910207	2912008	How about Lume 2, bitch?
2912168	2914529	They're working on a new Indiana Jones game.
2914750	2915010	Fine.
2915550	2917091	I'm sorry, there's a new Indiana Jones movie, right?
2917251	2917692	Fair enough.
2917772	2918152	Fair enough.
2918292	2919373	Indiana Jones again was pretty cool.
2920609	2924913	All right, we're going to head on over to our Skype line where we are taking your calls.

2964985	2967386	I did not lose a sock, but what are you calling in about tonight?
2968567	2969028	About the...
2970046	2972948	The sequel to the greatest game ever was released this week.
2995990	3006735	You guys really haven't talked about it much on the show, and I think a lot of people don't really know anything about it, so if I could do a short little spiel about the game and my experience with it, if that's alright with you.
3006795	3009056	I love the Mother series, go for it, show's all yours.
3009557	3018181	Okay, well, for people that don't know, Mother 3 is obviously the sequel to Mother 2, which is better known as Earthbound Outside of Japan.
3018561	3022943	That was an RPG for the Super NES, recently made famous by the
3023351	3026433	Star, Ness, appearing in both Super Smash Bros.
3027434	3030316	Mother 3 was in development for about 8 years.
3031356	3033918	It was even cancelled once and then revived.
3034378	3040402	Mother 3 was finally released on the 20th, 3 days ago in Japan on the Game Boy Advance.
3041983	3051810	I got to play a small portion of the game, but I really didn't want to spoil anything for me because I'm still praying that it's going to come out outside of Japan, which...
3052711	3058113	I don't know if that's ever going to happen, but I'm just hoping they'll say something at E3.
3059434	3071179	Fans of the original won't be disappointed because Mother 3 and Mother 2 Earthbound are connected to each other as much as two Final Fantasy games.
3071560	3075181	So new characters, a new world, but a lot of familiar stuff.
3077602	3080544	But I'm not surprised about this because Mother 1 was...
3082930	3084571	not connected to Mother 2 at all.
3085712	3092518	Probably the most interesting thing about Mother 3 was the beat rhythm.
3093259	3102967	The most important thing about Mother 3 and a lot of you beat rhythm game enthusiasts would like is the battle system.
3103447	3106409	It has this weird music combo thing where
3108379	3117884	The battle system is really music-oriented, so each character has a musical... They don't attack with a musical instrument, but it makes a musical instrument sound.
3120806	3124147	When the main character attacks, it sounds like a saxophone.
3125708	3132031	But if you actually attack on the beat of the battle music, you get a music combo.
3132051	3133412	But there's no visuals, there's...
3134238	3135959	to make you aware of this.
3136059	3141182	It's all audio, so you kind of got to tap along with the music or something.
3141683	3142863	I don't know how to explain it.
3142883	3144204	I only got to play it for a little bit.
3144564	3146145	Well, I'm going to have to check it out at some point.
3146466	3153210	And I know some folks in chat room are plugging this website, www.starmen.net, which I know is a huge Earthbound community.
3153530	3156572	I want to say we used to have a bunch of them that used to listen to this show a while back.
3156592	3156872	We did.
3156912	3158013	What the hell happened to them?
3158493	3159414	I don't even remember.
3159594	3162436	Well, see if I support their crappy game if they're going to abandon us.
3162516	3162936	No, I'm kidding.
3162976	3164157	I love Earthbound.
3164197	3165017	Nothing's going to change that.
3165137	3168820	Actually, Starman.net had a long-standing petition to bring Mother 3 into the U.S.
3169180	3171561	Yeah, I'm sure there's petitions out there, right?
3171822	3173743	I signed that petition a long time ago.
3175044	3185110	I'm a huge member of Starman.net, and if anybody wants to know anything about any of the Mother games, just check it out, Starman.net.
3185210	3187151	Tell those kids at Starman.net to come back.
3187191	3187592	We miss them.
3188842	3192165	Alright, well thank you for reminding us about Mother 3.
3192846	3195569	I should be slapped in the face for forgetting about that.
3196369	3197010	I apologize.
3197811	3198732	Alright, have a good one.
3198752	3199532	Bye-bye.
3201014	3201554	Andrew, get away.
3201594	3202535	I didn't mean that literally.
3202955	3204016	Can't slap me in the face literally.
3204697	3205558	Let's go to another call.
3205598	3206859	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3208440	3209481	Hi, Sky.
3209501	3210282	It's Raven's Dolphin.
3210382	3211383	Hello, Raven's Dolphin.
3211403	3212064	What's on your mind, buddy?
3214338	3214998	Nothing much.
3215159	3216279	My PSP died.
3216419	3217020	I dropped it.
3217700	3220201	Well, that'll happen if you drop expensive equipment.
3220222	3221262	It may not work anymore.
3221302	3221782	What happened?
3224204	3226205	Well, the dog knocked it off my TV.
3227586	3229527	Are you going to make the dog get a job to pay for it?
3231668	3234430	No, I got a warranty for it, so I'll get a new one.
3235115	3239778	Oh, you got one of those comparable warranty plans?
3239818	3240799	You got it.
3242400	3244682	I never buy that shit, but then again, I don't have a dog.
3247724	3248284	Yeah, I know.
3249185	3251646	And then I was in Mac Hell for the last week or so.
3253267	3255709	What have you been playing on your PSP lately before it got broke?
3258271	3258651	Dexter.
3258671	3258791	Dexter.
3259892	3265436	TigerClaw in chatroom wants to know, the question is, what the fuck was the PSP doing on top of the TV?
3265756	3266357	Good question.
3267678	3268558	I have no idea.
3268618	3270580	Clean your room, you messy son of a bitch.
3270620	3271020	Clean it.
3273662	3274743	Okay, I'll clean it more.
3274863	3275804	Alright, I appreciate it.
3276084	3277405	And punish the dog.
3277745	3278926	Shame on the dog for doing that.
3280547	3280887	I will.
3280947	3281828	No food for a week.
3281928	3282829	No, I'm kidding.
3282869	3283289	Don't do that.
3283329	3284630	I'm totally kidding.
3284810	3288433	Your dog meant well, but dogs do that sometimes.
3288800	3289821	Can I say one more thing?
3289941	3290661	Of course.
3292942	3295164	I do have a DS, so I do love that too.
3295504	3295824	All right.
3295904	3296564	Well, that's good to know.
3297665	3299686	I love my PSP and my DS.
3300087	3308491	I do games on the DS, and I do my PSP for everything else, like websites and emulators and things like that.
3309632	3310072	It's a good time.
3310633	3312033	But I like my PSP more.
3312494	3313714	Well, that's just fine.
3313794	3314775	Luminous is a great game.
3316016	3316436	I'll tell you that.
3317333	3318956	Still is, years later.
3318996	3320179	Weren't they doing a sequel to Luminous?
3320199	3322884	I would never have met Orange Lounge if it wasn't for my PSP.
3323264	3325589	Luminous 2 on PS2 and PSP.
3325649	3327392	Because of olrpsp.com?
3329935	3330975	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3353905	3357647	Download the new one if you haven't yet, and that way you'll fit on your 32-meg card a lot better.
3358088	3361030	I can't wait to see Loki drunk in DDR.
3362731	3367013	Well, we're going to get him drunk again at E3 just for the purpose of recording hilarious videos.
3367073	3370415	So, you know, that'll be at the E3 Outpost, everybody.
3370676	3371496	E3Outpost.com.
3371516	3372537	We'll be there live in person.
3373217	3376059	All right, Raven's Dolphin, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, okay?
3376079	3377120	Thank you for talking to me.
3377160	3377280	Bye.
3377300	3377780	Yeah, of course.
3377800	3378120	Bye-bye.
3379241	3380842	Let's go over to this call.
3380882	3382143	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3382163	3382283	Hello.
3384738	3385058	Hello.
3385158	3385918	Hello, can you hear me?
3386058	3386659	Yes, I can.
3386759	3387159	Who is this?
3388519	3390340	This is Nintendo Maniac 64.
3390400	3392300	What is on your mind, Nintendo Maniac 64?
3392960	3398202	Okay, I've been trying to, wanting to tell Loki this one thing that's just driving me nuts.
3398582	3399042	Okay, what?
3400162	3407064	Um, it was a while back, maybe like three weeks ago, he was talking about how Full Auto didn't have deathmatch or something like that.
3408365	3408605	Mm-hmm.
3410123	3418545	Well, and this was even longer ago, that I told him about Rush 2049, how it was another game with guns and cars and stuff like that.
3419145	3423486	Well, apparently he didn't realize that I was talking about it had a deathmatch mode.
3426306	3426626	Okay.
3428267	3438629	Yeah, and if you're looking for, like, a car shooter with, like, deathmatch things, like, you should, like, look into that, except it doesn't have online, but, uh,
3439113	3449343	It does have 4 player multiplayer, which is really cool, and you can get it on 5 systems, all 4 current gen ones, including Dreamcast.
3449984	3461595	You can get it on GameCube, PS2, and Xbox in Midway or K-Charge 3, and you can even get it on the N64 if you have an old console for retro's sake.
3462332	3462572	Cool.
3462692	3464513	You do that tomorrow, Loki.
3464533	3465814	You do it tomorrow.
3466014	3467715	That's your assignment for this week.
3467735	3468875	I'll just wait for Twisted Metal.
3469055	3469976	No wedding for you.
3469996	3470436	For PS3.
3470656	3471457	Alright, that'll be cool.
3471817	3474678	Nintendo Maniac, do you have to prove us wrong on anything else tonight?
3476819	3478300	Actually, I'm curious about this.
3479821	3480201	Loki.
3481462	3482202	I just said Loki.
3482222	3482863	I meant Sky.
3483063	3483743	Oh, hooray.
3483843	3484043	What?
3485984	3486484	You have a 360, correct?
3486504	3486564	Yes.
3489144	3490505	Is it a core or a premium?
3491085	3506969	I bought a core, but I bought the hard drive separate because I bought it when they were still going crazy about Xbox 360s and they were so hard to find that I just allowed myself to get raped financially and I bought a core and bought the hard drive separately because the core was all I could get at Best Buy.
3506989	3507709	They were out of premiums.
3508650	3510850	Okay, so does this mean you have corded controllers?
3511911	3513271	Yes, all my controllers are corded.
3514231	3514511	Okay.
3515071	3516692	I have three corded controllers.
3519008	3523911	And actually... I said this earlier today.
3525872	3531856	Do you know if it would even be possible to charge an Xbox 360 controller off a PSP?
3533197	3533978	No, you can't.
3534038	3536539	You don't have to charge the corded ones at all.
3536920	3537900	Those are just USB.
3537920	3538681	They plug right in.
3538701	3540022	Yeah, I know.
3540082	3540862	I meant the wireless.
3540942	3541423	Oh, the wireless.
3541443	3542263	I don't know if I don't use those.
3542303	3547667	No, you would not be able to because the PSP port does not put the right output for
3548246	3552410	USB, and besides, you'd have to have some sort of converter cable to do that anyway.
3552430	3553651	Well, I mean, if you have the converter.
3554191	3555932	Why would you want to do that anyways, though?
3556613	3557454	Because you can!
3557714	3559335	Why do people install Linux on things?
3559355	3560136	Well, here's the thing.
3560216	3572446	If you don't have the... Just keep... If you're really that hard-pressed to charge the battery, just keep the damn battery case that it comes with and put two AA batteries in there.
3572486	3573847	I mean, it'll work just the same.
3574228	3577030	Otherwise, you can find any other USB port and...
3577495	3581657	In your house, on your computer, on your PlayStation 2 or whatever, and charge your batteries that way.
3582537	3588560	Well, the thing is, if you're charged on the PSP, then you can basically still have a wireless controller.
3588600	3590561	You can go all through your house with you.
3594483	3595964	I don't know why.
3596004	3597544	For some reason, it's not clicking for me.
3597584	3598945	I don't understand why you want to do that.
3599545	3600286	But because you can't.
3600326	3600906	Because you can't?
3604489	3605510	Wait, was that a question to me?
3605910	3607712	Yes, why would you want to do that?
3609775	3618265	Well, then you can go the 11 feet into the kitchen that your Xbox 360 port's not going to let you go to.
3618385	3620628	But then the signal's not going to reach, so what good does it do?
3622116	3623597	It's not going to reach 11 feet.
3623857	3624617	Let me put it this way.
3624637	3627778	Most people don't play 11 feet away from their TV.
3628358	3631459	It's just retarded first off because you're not going to be able to see your TV.
3631499	3632980	Especially if you're playing Final Fantasy XI.
3633020	3634700	Assuming they even wanted to do that.
3634760	3636521	Hey, my uncle's couch is like...
3637267	3637647	DarkSakura,
3659378	3662079	and then put it out the extra, you know, six feet or whatever.
3662119	3664559	Those corded cables are long enough anyways.
3664979	3667660	I don't really think you're going to need to go that far.
3667720	3676082	I mean, granted, I'm sure if you've had other, you know, console systems that work, you know, with wireless controllers, then you're going to have to be in the same situation anyways.
3676122	3685945	Just either sit closer to the TV or just wait for some time to, you know, freaking charge those things or buy a goddamn quick charge kit and do it in like a couple hours.
3686785	3687005	That's
3687642	3689267	The best way to do it.
3689287	3689708	15 feet away.
3689748	3690651	How big is the TV?
3692716	3694200	I'm not sure, but it's pretty big.
3696541	3697302	It's for the porn.
3697642	3699063	Let me put it this way.
3699143	3703665	Even if Jamie's TV, and Jamie's TV is pretty huge, I wouldn't sit 15 feet away from that thing.
3704226	3706807	She's got her couches right next to that TV, too.
3706907	3708008	There's not a lot of space.
3708048	3708809	Let me put it this way.
3708849	3715492	When I'm sitting in a movie theater, I'm not even probably sitting that much further than 15 feet away, and that's a pretty damn large screen.
3715613	3719095	If it were anything smaller than that, I would not be sitting 15 feet away.
3719235	3719575	All right.
3719815	3725856	Too Much Anger, Nintendo Maniac, good luck with your quest to charge the 360 controller using all sorts of household devices.
3726336	3727136	I wish you luck, okay?
3727356	3727956	Good luck with that.
3727976	3728717	It's not going to work, though.
3729077	3730997	Have a good one.
3731017	3731217	Rush 2049.
3731437	3731757	All right.
3732117	3732937	Yeah, we got him for that.
3732977	3733237	Bye.
3737698	3738418	I love our listeners.
3739038	3739338	One more.
3739418	3740519	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3742559	3742899	Hello.
3743199	3743439	Hi.
3743819	3744559	Hi, who's this?
3744719	3745179	Can you hear me?
3745459	3746060	Yes, I can.
3746400	3746760	I can.
3747080	3748640	This is Zand from East Berlin.
3748888	3750528	Hi Xander from East Berlin, what's on your mind?
3750548	3754790	I don't think East Berlin exists anymore, does it?
3755290	3757871	I don't think so, you really fucked that up, but that's alright, what's on your mind?
3762212	3770454	I don't know if you reported on this earlier or not, but did you hear what the Katamari guy said about the Revmote earlier this week?
3771074	3776336	We didn't report on it, so why don't you put on your OLR reporter hat and tell us about it.
3778280	3780141	Okay, hold on, I gotta search for it here.
3780441	3783123	Um, it might be under my, uh, homework.
3783443	3786565	It might be under the shotgun shell, seeing as you're, uh, you know, in East Berlin.
3787325	3788045	East side!
3788386	3791687	Yeah.
3791727	3792188	Um, okay.
3792588	3797210	So, basically, um, and I'll have the exact quote with me right here.
3798571	3807056	Um, but basically he said, like, Nintendo's putting too much focus on the, more or less he said that Nintendo's putting too much focus on the, uh,
3807898	3816442	controller, and he just didn't really understand what exactly they're trying to do with it, and was kind of criticizing their strategy with it, you know, in a way.
3818302	3821624	I don't, you know, I'd get the exact quote if I had it in front of me, but I don't.
3822444	3827026	So basically the Katamari guy called Iwata a big smelly douche, correct?
3828327	3829487	No, not really.
3829507	3830928	That's how I interpret it.
3831688	3833149	That's just how Joystick is reporting it.
3833509	3833769	Okay.
3835773	3836513	What do you think?
3837694	3839694	Is this earth-changing news?
3839714	3842794	Katamari was done anyway.
3845075	3847975	I don't think any of us expected it to be on the Revolution.
3848055	3850356	No, but he could have done something new.
3850736	3854976	I think it would have been a good console if he did something new.
3855437	3860477	He needs to go back to designing his playground equipment and leave the video game world.
3860537	3863518	I want the Death Traps for Children playground equipment.
3863538	3864178	That would be awesome.
3864974	3866875	The one with the razor blade at the bottom of the slide?
3866975	3867135	Yep.
3868496	3873319	Somebody should show him Saw right before he has to do his playground design.
3873379	3874880	Silent Hill, the playground.
3876201	3876461	Alright.
3876942	3877602	What the fuck?
3878723	3880404	What the hell is that?
3880984	3881485	Now, now.
3881705	3883386	None of that during the show.
3883506	3885327	No fapping while you're on the line.
3885367	3885727	Come on.
3885747	3886548	That's disgusting.
3886968	3888889	Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
3891451	3892492	Reject false icons.
3892512	3893572	Alright, thank you very much.
3893612	3894093	Appreciate it.
3894333	3894733	Have a good one.
3896872	3898954	Goddammit, Jamie's having an influence on America.
3899814	3900335	Did you hear that?
3901616	3902556	Reject false icons.
3904458	3905699	All right, moving on.
3907380	3908541	Sorry we didn't get to all the calls.
3908721	3909441	Try again next week.
3910062	3911263	You can also leave us voicemails.
3911283	3914005	We'll be playing voicemails later on.
3914025	3914725	916-226-9067.
3914745	3916947	Remember, that's a toll call.
3917127	3920189	Or you can always leave us a message there on Orange Lounge Radio, our Skype name.
3920850	3922411	Loki, any last-minute stories tonight?
3922511	3922911	Just one.
3924946	3928628	So what is the next homebrew game coming to the PSP, you may ask?
3929569	3931030	Well, StarCraft.
3931610	3933232	They're working on porting over StarCraft.
3933532	3933792	What?
3935073	3939135	And apparently, not much has been done so far, but it's still early.
3939336	3952044	StarCraft PSP 1.2a has been released, and, well, not too much done yet, just doing some of the basic stuff, proof concept crap.
3953125	3954846	But anyways, that's something fun.
3956266	3958387	Alright, that's it?
3959167	3961288	You always have a ton of last minute stories, that's it?
3961708	3962688	It's been slow.
3962728	3966109	I've been filtering through stuff I don't want to talk about because it's retarded.
3966469	3969871	I don't like hearing people's opinions on crap.
3970591	3972451	Rumors that we think is going to happen on E3.
3974572	3975973	What we think is going to be coming out.
3976073	3976913	Yada, yada, yada.
3976933	3978814	You know, completely obvious shit.
3979214	3980894	The revolution will have games.
3980934	3981895	I mean, you know, stuff like that.
3982095	3985916	It's just... Are you getting a little bitter at the lack of news weeks before E3 here?
3986156	3986516	It is.
3986536	3988777	You know, I've been really slow.
3989517	3989818	All right.
3990618	3991858	But I've been really busy.
3991878	3993139	All right.
3993159	3995640	Before we get to tonight's last story, I have to do an apology.
3995700	3996720	So cue the sad music.
3998206	4009374	I apologize for pronouncing your name wrong and horribly butchering it earlier, but this is why I will forever be on amateur internet radio.
4029042	4032724	Please don't mispronounce City by calling him Bukkake.
4058018	4061360	GameLoft has teamed up with Paris Hilton Entertainment Inc.
4061660	4067804	to develop, publish, and distribute a line of cell phone games based on Paris Hilton.
4068505	4072087	The bigger question we should be asking is why is there a Paris Hilton Entertainment Inc.?
4072768	4073488	That surprised me.
4074009	4078131	Paris Hilton has a quote on this, the story originally coming from Kotaku, and they ran a quote here.
4078472	4084495	Quote, I'm excited to collaborate with GameLoft to bring the Paris Hilton brand and the glamour of young Hollywood.
4084656	4086577	Okay, there's nothing glamorous about her.
4086857	4089618	to the cell phones of all my fans around the world.
4090198	4100782	My phone has become an all-in-one entertainment device and mobile... Sorry, because I can't help but think about that list that got leaked and all the topless photos of her on the phone.
4100802	4101863	Yeah.
4102745	4104587	Definitely a one-stop entertainment stop.
4105407	4107209	And mobile games are an integral part of that.
4107789	4111333	Mobile gaming is really hot right now, and I'm excited to be a part of this project.
4111373	4115056	Well, that's... She doesn't use the word integral.
4115416	4116857	Some publicist put that out.
4119800	4121622	Mobile games are an integral part of that.
4121642	4123143	Yeah, she did not use that word.
4123323	4127187	Unless there's a game that features a target over her, I ain't playing it.
4128047	4128668	Integral, that...
4129195	4131275	That right there is... That's a grown-up word.
4131315	4133476	That's over her limit of syllables per word.
4135116	4137336	Now, of course, that makes our chatroom go wild.
4137997	4140277	Popanda21, I love the simple life.
4140357	4141137	Did you lose a sock?
4141237	4141757	I'm a slut.
4141797	4142197	The game.
4142597	4143478	You will bow to me.
4143558	4145298	Peter Jackson's One Night in Paris.
4146978	4150679	The actual quote's probably like, talkie device, play game.
4151559	4154780	DJ Poo Eater, Paris Hilton the Whore, MMORPG.
4156280	4156720	I'd hit it.
4158198	4158979	You know what?
4159660	4164185	Paris Hilton, mobile phone gaming, these two shitty things deserve each other.
4165906	4166347	Honestly.
4166427	4168469	I'm looking forward to seeing it on the next N-Gage.
4168930	4171172	You bought an N-Gage, didn't you?
4175949	4177790	That's the question we have to ask Paris Hilton.
4178570	4183772	Do you think Paris Hilton will be at E3?
4184032	4185792	And then we could ask her?
4186092	4186352	Maybe.
4187613	4189894	We need to somehow make that happen.
4190094	4191534	Because there's a lot I want to ask her.
4191774	4194535	And only a couple of it has to do with video games.
4194955	4196576	But I know you want to hear it anyway, come on.
4197436	4200557	I wonder who's going to be at the Nintendo thing.
4201448	4201948	I don't think so.
4201968	4203149	I think this was at the Paramount, I think.
4226232	4226572	Oh, okay.
4226692	4226992	Never mind.
4227213	4228033	Wherever the hell that is.
4228233	4228854	Alright, forget it.
4230655	4232976	Oh, DJ PooEater says, here's the question I could ask her.
4233276	4236818	What the shit are you doing at E3, you smelly dog-carrying poo-face?
4237578	4238659	That's exactly what I'd ask.
4239620	4240160	What the shit?
4240220	4242081	We might... Eloquent.
4242781	4245503	We might ask the same of Sinbad as well.
4247264	4248304	What the shit are you doing at E3?
4250376	4251136	That's a great question.
4251156	4252457	I should have user-submitted questions.
4252657	4253178	This is what we'll do.
4253278	4258260	Listen to the show Wednesday, and we'll tell you what celebrities are at E3, and if we can run into them Thursday, we'll ask them questions.
4258280	4259401	Okay, we can guarantee these two.
4260081	4261882	Sinbad, because he's there every year.
4262282	4262823	I don't know why.
4263703	4266845	And Gary Coleman usually is there in some form.
4267345	4269006	Wait, user-submitted questions.
4269046	4271447	We are guaranteed your ass is kicked out of E3.
4272088	4273669	That's why we won't ask any of them until Friday.
4276470	4276970	Good plan.
4277751	4278071	All right.
4279824	4280244	That's it.
4280304	4280905	That's the show.
4282106	4283508	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4284168	4285249	Andrew, thank you so much for being here.
4286170	4286851	Long time no see.
4286871	4287491	Don't be a stranger.
4287972	4288272	Oh, yeah.
4288332	4289113	Your final thought, please.
4289513	4290314	Toasters for life.
4291115	4292156	Loki, your final thought.
4293077	4294278	I have so much work to do.
4295359	4299282	And my final thought is, please, won't anybody think of the children?
4300544	4300884	That's it.
4301363	4302003	Have a great night.
4302463	4305484	And remember, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, please do us a big favor.
4305825	4310086	Tell somebody about us because that is how we spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio.
4310386	4314608	We're just some no-name little indie site doing a show here we've been doing for almost four years now.
4314908	4316248	And it's all word of mouth, baby.
4316288	4322210	So if you could just tell somebody you love or tell somebody you hate about our show and get them to listen, that's all the payment we need.
4322250	4322850	We appreciate it.
4323050	4327012	And remember, until we sell out, which should be happening pretty soon.
4327072	4329213	And spread that video like wildfire.
4329833	4330133	Oh, yeah.
4331798	4332399	Have a good one.
4332439	4335460	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
