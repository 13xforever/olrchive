Orange Lounge Radio
Deja Vu
Final Fantasy XI Game Boy Advance Space Channel 5
I brought along Vib Ribbon, of course, for the PS1.
It's a classic.
That I've seen before, but it is a classic.
Yeah, it's a pretty common one, but on the off chance.
The main one that I was excited to bring to you was Primal Image, which we talked about last week.
That's right.
Primal Image was the Pokemon Snap with supermodels, right?
Yeah, except I played it again.
I mean, they don't really look like supermodels.
Just people.
Supermarket models.
Superwhores.
Yes.
All right.
Sounds awesome.
All right, one system that has gotten a lot of attention lately with all the things you can do with it is the Nintendo DS.
And we thought we'd start this segment of the show off with some hacking news.
Loki, what's going on with Nintendo DS, hack-wise?
Well, hack-wise, you know, they've done some really cool things.
Like at E3 last year, they had this thing called the DS Download Station.
And you can actually download demos of games to your DS.
And these have actually started to roll out into stores now.
And you might see them at a local Best Buy or that type of thing.
The only thing is, if you don't have one nearby, what are you to do?
What are you to do?
Well, build your own.
That's right.
Actually, plans were put up on the internet on how to build your own DS station.
And they have the files out there to do it.
A whole tutorial.
It's pretty simple.
You just basically need to get an RT2500 based Wi-Fi card in your computer.
Or sometimes your laptop will have one too because you can do the PCMI card.
Can I do it on my Apple?
You might be able to.
I'm not sure.
I'll try it.
I'm not sure.
But they have a whole list of stuff that's available to basically do this.
And
All the demos that they have on here, which I'm sure I don't know how they got the demos off the demo station, but they're all the ones that are currently out there now.
Brain training and all that fun stuff.
So if you really want to do it, I wanted to get this done on my laptop so we could actually do it in the studio.
Maybe for next week, but... Isn't it just a matter of time before they figure out a way to beam the games over?
Not just the demo, but possibly the whole freaking games?
I'm not sure if they can store that much on there.
Ah, okay.
But still, you know...
Interesting.
And apparently, though, if you do have a Game Boy Advance flash cart, you can record the games to that, and there's a way around where you can actually play them off of that, too.
Nintendo's probably a little irked at this news.
Probably, yeah.
You know, for those folks who maybe live in a remote part, or maybe, you know, I think what would be very interesting is using this in other countries.
I think some folks who are in other countries like Japan, the UK, who might not be seeing these games for a little while otherwise, and even the demos, can play these long before they're released in those, well, not Japan so much, maybe the UK, released in that country.
Yeah, I think that's pretty cool.
Or the other thing is maybe modify it to put Homebrew on there to play Homebrew games that you can transfer via Wi-Fi without having to have all this fancy stuff.
GamerDude1212 says, Nintendo hates all this piracy stuff.
I don't doubt it.
I don't doubt it at all.
I'm sure they do.
Most companies do hate it.
It's probably not going to be an issue later because think about it.
The virtual console, the fact that the Revolution is going to have Wi-Fi, the fact that it's going to be able to hook up to the DS...
You'll probably be able to download these for free off of the DS, or the Revolution anyways, so what's the big deal?
How cool would that be anyway to, you know, go to Nintendo.com and download something that you can beam?
Forget this whole store, you know, why not bypass the kiosks and stores and be able to download demos to your DS just like you can on Xbox Live, but you do it through your computer?
I think they should be endorsing this stuff, not turning their back on it.
But, yeah, whatever.
What do I know?
I do know this, Xbox Live is going to be doing another free week, but it's during the week of E3.
This time it's not just, I don't think it's just one weekend, I think it's actually doing a whole week, no I'm sorry, it is just one weekend.
But the weekend that they're going to be doing this is May 8th.
No, it is a full week, it's because it's running through May 15th.
And it's going to be sponsored by, well I'm not sure, I thought I saw the name of the sponsor there.
I thought, um, not FIFA, um... Well, FIFA World Cup Soccer 2006 might hit the marketplace during that same week.
It wasn't FIFA, it was a shoe brand that was, um, doing it.
I can't remember.
I'm trying to see if I can find it here.
Adidas.
Adidas, that's it.
They were doing it.
I knew I could find it, yay!
So, Adidas, all day I dream about.
Sorry, my mind just can't help but go there.
Good idea, bad idea to do this during the week of E3.
Because most of the hardcore gamers will be either at E3 or glued to their computers reading updates on E3.
So is this a smart thing to do?
Right now you can go play a demo of it on Xbox Live Arcade.
That would be very cool.
You think they would actually do that?
Play the demos that they're playing at E3?
Download them right now?
No way.
Why not?
Because they just don't do that.
Or maybe limited ones.
Maybe, but is there anything so wrong with putting those demos out there on Xbox Live for everybody to play?
Is it just because the games are usually half finished or what?
There is actually one out on Xbox Live now, the Tomb Raider one.
Right, well they have several of those demos.
I think it would be a good idea, but not like, have it be like a specific download, like you have a certain amount of points, you can download it, something like that.
I mean, how cool would that be?
This is the closest you can get to E3, you know?
Right here in your living room.
Play the same demo they're all playing at E3 right now.
I think that would be great publicity stunt.
Especially since, bless their hearts, they decided to not give everybody who works for anyone who sells video games passes.
So, it is going to reduce the amount of
People who are going to be able to go to E3 Somehow this no-name site got in though, which is amazing We actually report I know, we're a legitimate business, believe it or not We don't work in the garden section at Walmart Exactly
One thing that I could see turning a lot of prospective developers away from that, though, is that the average E3 demo is nowhere near as polished as a demo you might get on a demo disc.
And a lot of people who are casually downloading off the marketplace might be using this as, you know, is this my final decision on purchasing this game?
And that would definitely scare a lot of people away.
You play a demo of an unfinished game, it's not very good.
You don't come back to it six months later when it's really ready to be played.
E3 Demo
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That would target them and make them feel like they're a part of something.
I think a lot of gamers would really go for, oh, this developer is targeting me, I want to play this.
You know what, we need to start an Xbox development company.
Right now.
I have a better idea.
Green Lounge Gaming.
How about this?
What?
How about we sell 360 games with hamburgers?
Ah, I love this idea.
I love this idea.
Can any of us cook?
Oh, how about this?
No, no, I got it.
Excuse me.
Xbox Live with Super Bacon.
Okay, my stomach has just turned really awfully now.
I feel nauseous.
I feel nauseous too, but now I want Super Bacon.
All right, anyway, moving on.
One Xbox Live, or one Xbox title, I should say, in general has been turning heads is Oblivion.
Right, Loki?
Oblivion has been turning heads, and it's been selling and selling and selling and
I want to say 2.5 million.
That's a lot of copies.
A lot of copies.
You know what I think selling these?
Nude Patch?
Oh yeah.
Is that all there is to say?
It's just sold a lot?
No, not at all.
I'm just bullshitting.
Basically, it's gotten really good scores out of a lot of the magazines that reviewed it.
They've sold over 1.7 million units of Oblivion for the PC and the 360...
since they've shipped from launch.
And it's been on the covers of magazines.
It's just really good.
It's ended world hunger.
It's basically accounted for approximately... It found Osama Bin Laden.
It's amazing.
It accounted for 13% of all PC game sales in the first week since it was released.
And by the way, the other 87% was World of Warcraft, amazingly.
Go figure.
You know what I want to know?
Where the hell is my free feel?
I don't know.
I think we should do all of our games in Commodore 64 Basic because I know how to program in Commodore 64 Basic.
Is there a way we... Oh, Spike's doing this.
You, me, you.
Yep.
Let's program some games in Commodore 64 Basic and somehow find somebody to port them to the Xbox 360.
That would be awesome.
You have banana.
Throw?
YN?
You have bacon.
Eat?
YN?
Syntax Error.
Ready.
Speaking of Xbox Live, Saints Row is going to be having a very large demo going to the Xbox Live Marketplace.
Grand Theft Auto, The Saints Row
Yeah.
It's kinda... It was supposed to be the Grand Theft Auto killer that never freaking came out.
Gotcha.
Well, it's on its way, and it's supposedly gonna have multiplayer, so there's supposed to be a very large demo coming to Xbox Live.
They just don't say when, just sometime before release.
You know what I say?
To hell with the Saints Row.
It's all about Crackdown.
Crackdown is gonna be awesome.
If you've gotten this month's official Xbox magazine, they have a trailer for Crackdown.
It's like...
Grand Theft Auto with basically a superhuman as the lead in it so you can throw cars at people.
Nothing says, give me my money, bitch, than throwing a fucking car into your head.
That takes me back to Narc.
Very good.
The chat room is still talking about this game thing.
You know that we did have somebody make Orange Launch Radio the game already.
That was Illusion.
One of our fans actually made that, and it's in the forums.
But now people want to take this to the next level.
DJ PooEater says that he knows the Flash programming.
I know DarkSakura knows that too.
Maybe we could have them team up.
I know how to do ads.
Oh, but not the programming.
And I know how to do slideshows.
Well, maybe you could do the art and he could do the programming.
I'm halfway through my flash semester.
You can make an awesome opening cinema.
There you go.
There you go.
I love this idea.
Can I do it for my homework?
Sure.
If I get school credit for it, okay.
Check that out on the forums.
I think Illusion still has that up.
I'm supposed to put it on our MySpace or our website as well, though.
I totally forgot.
I forgot to send them a private message saying we can move it and suck our own bandwidth away.
It's fabulous.
It's a text adventure.
It's the most fun you'll ever have playing Orange Lounge Radio the game.
You had me at text adventure.
I'm invincible.
Every time I type in an attack, nothing would happen.
Spoiler alert!
Oh my god, spoilers.
I can't believe you ruined the Orange Lounge radio game for everybody.
I didn't say what happened.
I just said I'm invincible.
And you know what happens on page 290?
Jamie kills Dumbledore.
It's amazing.
That's not a spoiler.
I didn't say what happens in the game.
I just said I'm invincible.
Alright.
Aerith died.
And I cheered.
I still have my memory card saved.
Okay, you've told this story five times on the show.
More than that, but I still think that... It's like one of her crowning moments.
It's something I'm very proud of.
I still have my file.
You should sell that card on eBay, that memory card.
Hell no!
Jamie's saved game at Dead Aerith.
No, no, no, this memory card is special.
I'd buy it.
It's my first memory card I ever had.
It's an off-brand one.
It has a Sakura sticker on it.
and it has all of my old Tekken 3 save files and bus to move.
So yeah, that memory card is special to me.
Oh, and my Symphony of the Night files with 210%.
Dork.
Alright.
DarkSakura likes to travel the world from her computer because she has buddies over in the UK and she doesn't want them to feel left out.
So she serves some of the UK news sites to find out what's going on in gaming in the UK.
What's going on in gaming.
But of course, you know, what goes on over there often affects what happens over here.
So we don't like to think of it as necessarily UK only news.
It's just news from the UK.
Nice disclaimer.
You're welcome.
I find I have to use them quite frequently with you.
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
Heart.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You need to just be nice to me because I hurt.
Heart?
Don't make heart signs at me.
That's not going to make me... It's the OLR gang sign.
A little heart.
I think this should be the official OLR gang sign.
Make a heart with your hands.
If you don't know how to do it, we'll take a picture.
You're retarded then.
There is a picture... Shut up!
There is a picture of you.
Doing that?
Doing hearts.
Sweet.
From the club.
Sweet.
I'll put it up online.
You also look really silly in that picture too.
You can't use...
No, I'm going to do Brazil News now.
It's a Polish developer called Nibris, I guess is how it's pronounced.
They're working on a film noir inspired game for the revolution called Sadness, which I automatically want to play it because it's very emo and goth.
But they are basing it off of movies like Sin City.
And they're saying the whole game is going to be done in black and white.
It's set before the World War.
We don't get any of the depression prohibition stuff.
But you get to complain about different things.
Sin City the game what?
It's based off of movies like Sin City.
Oh, okay.
Did we get chicks with guns?
Because that was the best part of Sin City was chicks with guns.
Chicks with a Sword
I haven't seen Sin City.
Spoiler!
You haven't seen Sin City.
What is your problem?
You need to go out right away and see this movie.
I have something called Life, and I've had the movie since it came out on DVD.
I feel Sin City was slightly overrated, but it's worth seeing.
It's worth your time.
On a rainy day.
I have this thing that's called Life, where I go to school.
Next time you're sick with whatever plague you catch next, on the couch, instead of Kingdom Hearts 2, put that down and watch Sin City for a little bit.
Ace Combat on PSP
Ace Combat X, Skies of Deception, and I think it is X and not 10 because they haven't gone up to past 5.
So it's going to be on the PSP.
It's a combination campaign-based single-player plane thingy with wireless multiplayer.
And speaking of numbers, I have not played one Ace Combat game.
I have Ace Combat 4.
I actually, wasn't the first one on Super Famicom?
I have not played one Ace Combat game, original PlayStation.
That's right.
No, it's another game I'm thinking of.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
If it's not Top Gun, I don't care.
Dude, Top Gun was awesome.
Top Gun's coming out for the DS.
Fuck yeah!
But is it going to be incredibly difficult to land?
How hard is it going to be to refuel your damn plane?
Don't remind me.
Nightmares.
Famitsu stated that Namco said that Skies of Deception will feature an original storyline all told through CG.
You'll be a pilot in the Griffith Squadron of the Federal Republic of Aurelia.
Yeah, four planes, the F-14D Super Tomcat, Tornado F-3, F-2A, and MIG-31 Foxhound.
Foxhound.
You know what they need to tie it in with?
Ace Combat 6 Oblivion.
Shut up.
So it's actually slated to be out this fall in Japan.
Hot.
Guess what?
What?
MMOs!
Oh goody, another crack for me to get addicted to.
Pirates of the Caribbean.
Ooh!
which I think is going to be kind of key.
I already played Puzzle Pirates.
You know what?
Yeah.
I used to bilge and bilge and bilge.
Oh, sorry.
You were fussing at me for not doing the stupid thing and I changed it and then you decided to change the subject and what the fuck?
Sorry, Miss Dark Sakura.
Damn straight.
So, as I was saying before Rob so rudely interrupted me,
What were you saying anyway?
You were talking about Pirates of the Caribbean.
You better go.
Disney.
We love Disney.
They announced the PC MMO Pirates of the Caribbean Online will be there to show at E3, but not on stores until 2007.
It was supposed to launch with the next film coming out, Dead Man's Chest, in the summer, but it's going to be later this year.
The speculation is that it'll be out with the third film.
You can create your own pirate and interact with the characters from the movies.
Hundreds of customizations available.
Buried Treasure, Scary Pirates, and a subscription.
Scary Pirates 2?
You know why I want to get this game the day it comes out?
So I can have a character named Arr.
Arr.
I want a character named Ger-Arg.
I just want Arr.
Our Buffy fans will know this.
Yes, unfortunately they will.
I'm going to actually hunt this one down to check out at E3.
And last but not least, everybody's favorite part, release dates.
Because release dates make for the happy.
Since I didn't get to mention anything that came out last week, the only thing really worth mentioning is
Dragon Quest Journey of the Cursed King, Daxter Mega Man Battle Network 5 That's about it Coming up this upcoming week On the 20th we have Final Fantasy XI Treasures of Art Erg Blah Art Ergen That's what I'm calling it anyway 99 Nights on Xbox 360 Desperados 2, Cooper's Revenge, Dragon Ball Z, Shin Budokai Electroplankton Woohoo
More Final Fantasy XI than you can stick at on the 21st.
And actually, to correct myself, the Desperados, Dragon Ball Z, Electroplankton, those are all on the 21st.
We also have Iron Warriors, Rogue Trooper, SOCOM 3.
We have Spellforce 2, Shadow Wars on the PC, State of Emergency 2.
Tamagotchi!
When is Tamagotchi going to freaking die? !
I mean, they made up for it with... Give one to me, I manage to kill them all the time.
They made up for it with Digimon.
I actually have one of the old, original Digimon.
It's great.
And yeah, also on the 21st Tetris DS.
For the DS.
Imagine that.
Oh, what a shock.
And then also Jamie's birthday, the game.
Celebrated worldwide.
Alright.
Loki!
There's nothing coming out this week.
Not except for Final Fantasy XI.
Both of them.
360 and the expansion on PlayStation 2.
And then the PC.
But other than that, really, there is nothing coming out this week.
No other games that are worth a damn... Oh, actually, I should take that back.
There's going to be... What was it?
Dream Falls coming out on the Xbox this week.
But other than that, there's nothing.
Slow news week, huh?
Tokyo Extreme Race or Drift.
That's it.
Alright, tell us about another MMO, Loki.
We had DarkSakura talking about Puzzle Pirates 2.
Puzzle Pirates... Never mind.
You were the addict to Puzzle Pirates.
It was a fun game.
I would like to announce that they actually announced the MMO last year at E3.
They gave out these stupid gold coins that you would get to go have special access to the...
Show Floor, or something, this year.
So, yeah, we knew it was coming.
Anyways, we didn't know what was coming, though, was this game coming from Acclaim, who's doing a martial arts MMO.
That's right, martial arts MMO.
No one cares.
Anyways, it's going to be called Nine Dragons, being developed by Indie21.
And it's supposed to be to put gamers in their own kung fu fighting online game.
Sounds kind of like, was it Matrix Online to me?
Because that game is all Kung Fu.
Anyways, it's currently planned to be released later this year.
So, look for that.
First off, why are there so many MMOs?
I mean, because not only do you get the sucker to buy the game at first, but then you get them to pay for it every month.
That's why.
Because we keep buying them.
I guess.
Where's my Blaster Master MMO?
You might remember one very popular MMO started on a Dreamcast, on the Dreamcast, that was Phantasy Star.
Although I don't know if I'd call Phantasy Star so much an MMO as it is like a multiplayer experience.
It's a multiplayer repetitive action game, which I actually still occasionally play.
A story from Retro Gaming has been circulating the blogs, video game stuff out there this week.
It's games that defined the Dreamcast.
So I thought maybe we could nerd out a little bit and talk about the Dreamcast for a minute.
What do you think are some games that defined the Dreamcast?
Since you mentioned Phantasy Star Universe, I'd like to mention that Phantasy Star Universe is supposed to be coming out on October 25th.
One of the ones I forgot to mention.
Is that from your little list there?
Yeah.
Alright, there you go.
Um...
Blue Stinger.
And I'm referring specifically to the Japanese version because the US version was ass.
As in not even a nice one, as more like a stinky unwashed ass.
Thank you for that visual.
The Japanese one had these really massive camera angles, just cinematic.
And even though the gameplay was pretty, you know, beat thingy with stick, lightsaber...
Run Up A Tower, blah, blah, blah.
The camera angles, I thought, were just so neat.
It was such a different experience playing that as opposed to a lot of the stuff that was on the PlayStation because, you know, you scroll out too far on PlayStation, it would just completely look crap.
But it's kept such a good look.
I mean, it made it difficult to play in places, but, you know, I actually liked Boostinger.
I traded my copy of the Dragon Ball GT game.
All right.
Which at the time was stupid because it was going for $150 on eBay.
Oh, we all make mistakes.
Loki, Spike, any defining Dreamcast games for you?
Power Stone, Crazy Taxi, and Jet Set Radio.
That's another... Crap.
Evolution, actually.
I thought, because it brought out... Actually, Grandia 2 was also another good one.
Space Channel 5.
Spike, anything that comes to mind for you?
So Project Justice definitely comes to mind.
Amen!
The Japanese one with the little board game.
Yes!
That was so much fun, and you could customize your character.
You know what, though?
I have to admit, I was a little upset that we didn't have another school life mode, like the Japanese PlayStation games.
The, um, yeah, the second rival schools, the Shiri to Justice Kakouen that they did?
Yeah.
I actually, I paid 90 bucks to import that thing.
Me too.
Because I had such a hard time finding it.
And I love playing through the high school mode!
And I got wished happy birthday by Batsu.
Aw, see, I was always trying to get Nagare to fall in love with me.
I never did.
But it's the game that gave us, uh, the, uh, you could play as, uh, Ran, as Ran, as, uh, Nagare, um, but, uh, but, uh, Moaru, uh, Justice Kakuen gave us, um, Zaki, who was
I actually, one of my first pieces of fan art that ever got published by another site was one of the big rival schools websites took a fan art I did of Zaki.
You're listening to the Geeky Dreamcast Gamer Podcast.
And of course, we've got to mention DDR Second Mix Club version.
That was my first DDR that I owned.
Extover wants to participate in tonight's show by naming, I guess, something, a Dreamcast game?
I'm surprised that you didn't name it, but Sonic Adventure.
Right?
Gutsu's Voice
Icaruga
The Dreamcast Direct version of Vampire Chronicles, much better than the Chaos Tower BS, super long load time PSP version There was also the For Matching Service series of Street Fighter games Yes, which, you know, SNK vs. Capcom 2, you know, because the game was messed around on the Naomi board Guilty Gear X, absolutely, although, you know Virtual On
Oh yes!
And if you've got the twin sticks, oh yeah.
I actually, I bought the little Saturn adapter so I could use my Saturn twin sticks.
I still need Saturn twin sticks.
Alright, nerds.
Did you ever have Dreamcast sex?
Alright.
Stop it.
Nerds, we've got to get to the chatroom feedback here.
Dark Knight says SNK vs. Capcom 2.
HitStun says Metropolis Street Racer.
TigerClaw says Don't Forget Crazy Taxi on the Dreamcast.
Amplitude says MVC 2.
Lots and lots of good choices.
GS191 hit the nail on the head.
Seaman.
The original story named these games, Soul Calibur, Shenmue, Jet Grind Radio, Space Channel 5, Crazy Taxi, Virtua Tennis and Tennis 2K2, Skies of Arcadia, the both Power Stone games, both Sonic Adventure games, Samba de Amigo, hello, we started as a music thing, we should have known about that one, Virtua Fighter, Echo the Dolphin, Defender of the Future, Choo Choo Rocket, Phantasy Star Online, Street Fighter 3 Third Strike, Ikaruga,
and import games like Rez.
There was Rez.
Good stuff.
Alright, that was our Dreamcast geeky moment.
Enjoy.
Actually, I do have one of the crappiest games ever for Dreamcast.
Shenmue?
No, it was import only.
Super Producers.
Where you manage the career of a pop idol.
You know what my favorite Dreamcast game is?
DC Ness.
Definitely.
Definitely.
You know what else game came out?
Was the roommate 2-1-3 or something?
Where you play as some guy's roommate?
I thought of a really, really good one.
I thought of a really good one.
The Typing of the Dead.
Typing of the Dead!
Yay!
Yay, I win.
I get to participate in the geeky chat.
It also has spawned some of the best cosplay ever.
I plan on eventually doing some cosplay once people kind of forget about that game.
All right, we really, really got to move on.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Some people are saying that the Xbox 360 is kind of a new version of the Dreamcast.
I don't know.
Take it or leave it.
But what's going on with Burnout on the Xbox 360, Loki?
They finally, finally fixed it.
So now I can play the damn car I downloaded off the Xbox 360 kiosk months ago.
Stupid bastards.
Teasing me at the damn car they'll be able to play when they get the game and couldn't play it for months.
Anyways, but they did add some new cars to download as well online, so you can get a bunch of cars that they've whored out from different sponsors.
And one of the updates, well, other than the cars on the kiosks working now, you cannot spam your recommended clips to people on your recent players list.
In other words, people that you just played in games.
You can't go, hey, look at my clip that I made.
That sucks.
I just want to get achievements.
So there.
I was sitting here like, what's yellow card?
Thank you, Rob.
You're welcome.
I did check it out a little bit.
But the only thing that I don't like is you have to unlock the cars in the game.
So, that kind of sucks.
Alright.
Go check that out.
Download it.
Enjoy it.
One person that will probably not be playing... Yes?
The chatroom just made me happy because they remembered Rod Caliber.
Dorks.
We're done with Dreamcast.
We're done with Dreamcast.
I know, but it has a special place in my heart.
We can never be done with Dreamcast.
One person that never touched a Dreamcast, you can be certain, is Jack Thompson.
And what's Jack up to this week, DarkSakura?
Jackie Poo is being a poopy head.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Professionalism, right.
Well, he's filed suit against the Florida Bar Association.
So...
Basically, as reported by a daily business review, also reposted with GamePolitics, who are our heroes.
Oh, we love them.
Yeah, he's filed a million-dollar federal lawsuit against the Florida Bar saying that the organization is harassing him by investigating his baseless complaints.
One million dollars!
But, and I love what GamePolitics commented on this, just to quote,
We're glad someone enjoys what Jack does but we've reread the First Amendment umpteen times and still can't find the right to annoy people.
Amen.
I love this post in our forums.
If I could read this from our forums.
I love this listener.
He makes a lot of great posts on our forums here.
The Ichiban Crush.
He posted the bunny picture on my MySpace.
We love our listeners, and this guy's just living proof.
I love this post he made.
Regarding Jackie Poo, I actually hope no one makes a game to his description.
This is a follow-up to last week's story where we talked about the whole Jack Thompson hates joystick and all that.
Because with his last modest proposal, what did he do?
Back out of his promise of donating $10,000 to charity when someone called his bluff.
Oh, and let's not even get into the hissy-fits he targeted towards everyone who pointed out Jack's lack of credibility or paid the fee on his behalf.
Why are we even giving a shit about this parasitic, ambulance-chasing, morally bankrupted, failure of a lawyer and human being anymore?
In the grand scheme of things, has he made an ounce of influence in the way we as gamers or the game industry does its thing?
No, not at all.
What we have here is an over-glorified internet troll.
Nothing more, nothing less.
His own actions weaken any and all chance for these holy crusades coming through.
This isn't even about fundamentalist antics anymore because it seems even those guys are laughing at him.
So no, I wouldn't give him what he wants.
More people to cry wolf about to the authorities.
It's trolls bait, folks.
Don't bite.
Love it.
Love it.
Should we even be reporting on him anymore?
I don't know.
I feel like we have an obligation to, but at the same time, I totally get the village idiot perspective.
I'm sick.
I'm really sick of everything having to do with his name coming up.
We dealt with him in the mid-90s over the whole cop killer thing for Ice-T.
And now we're dealing with him over video games.
I don't see, you know, of course people are going to complain about him because he's displayed this utter lack of professionalism in all of his dealings with everybody.
And, you know, people have reposted emails where he has just completely gone to name-calling and finger-pointing like a freaking schoolyard bully, you know.
That's all he is, is an overblown bully.
All he's trying to do is keep his name in the spotlight.
This isn't about helping families.
This isn't about cleaning up America.
This is about keeping money in his pocket and the spotlight on him.
You know, one thing, though, that I guess is good, a good thing that comes from all this reporting on this guy is it really does bring the game community together in really interesting ways.
Take that whole, you know, Pixelante thing, the flowers for Jack.
At least there's that good, that little silver lining that comes out of it as it brings people together out of their hatred for this guy.
Well, what he needs to also keep in mind that the majority of people who buy video games are in our age group.
The people in this room, we are the ones who are paying for these games.
We are the ones who are doing a lot of the playing.
And true, yeah, a lot of teenagers and younger kids are playing games.
But we're the ones who've been keeping the industry going.
We were there from the beginning.
And like I've brought up before,
There has been so much concrete proof to refute everything he's saying and he just refuses to accept fact as fact.
I honestly am sick of him.
I'm sick of how utterly stupid he is.
He's proof that one can have a college education and still be retarded.
You can address those cards and letters to DarkSakura.
Please do.
If he emails anybody, email me.
I will tell you exactly what I think about you.
Mailbag at OrangeLawnRadio.com if anybody wants to comment.
The U.S.
isn't the only place where video games are investigated.
Japan's National Police Agency is currently investigating the effects playing video games and watching anime has on children.
This is being led by a former Deputy Governor of Tokyo, Yutaka Takahana.
These guys met on April 10th in Tokyo to discuss violent video games and sexual content on the internet.
Previously, though, there really hasn't been a whole lot of controversy in Japan regarding the in-game violence, but this current generation of games, of course, Grand Theft Auto and so on, sort of brings this back to the spotlight there.
Also, it should be pointed out, the sale of Grand Theft Auto 3 was actually banned from being sold to anyone under the age of 18 in two separate Japanese prefectures.
So, and so on, so they're just doing this study here, I guess seeing if maybe they need to be a little more tighter on this stuff in Japan.
I don't know, doubt it'll happen.
I think the only thing anime does is just warp our sense of what kind of women we can achieve, you know.
and women don't have breasts that are that big.
At least not that many of them.
And also, tentacle rape is not good.
All this stuff about the laws and the people that keep talking about this stuff, it just makes me angry.
I don't know about you guys, but I get a little bit angry when I think about this stuff.
And so that's why we have a segment here on Orange Lounge Radio dedicated to getting a little bit of this angst out of our system.
And it's called the FUs of the Week.
Are you ready to get angsty, boys and girls?
DarkSakura F you to whatever that fatigue shit I had was earlier in the week because it sucked I actually like being able to get out of bed and do stuff and I hate missing the show so yeah just F you to whatever has caused the weird random fatigue I had Loki F you to the amount of alcohol I drank last night because that sucked and F you to certain sites
Thank you.
Spike!
Do you have any FUs?
FU to cellular phones that don't work.
That would make me angry too.
My FU this week goes to Loki for not singing karaoke last night, despite how drunk we got him.
You'll have to kill me for this, you big pussy.
Will you sing when you die?
Maybe.
He'll sing when he's dead.
Loki!
Sing to us a little bit about Nintendo DS's other news.
The DS is getting a TV... No, I said sing.
I'm just kidding, go ahead.
The DS is getting a TV tuner.
A TV tuner the size of an Xbox.
No, the TV tuner is ginormous.
And, yeah, it's not very portable.
But if you're interested, it is available.
And apparently, well, I don't know.
It's being reported by Famitsu Magazine.
They have a picture of it.
And it literally is bigger than a DS.
And we're talking old DS.
Wow.
And apparently, you know, if it's like any of the other TV tuners out there, probably doesn't get very good reception.
Alright.
So why would anybody want to buy this?
I don't know, fair enough
All right, also coming to the DS, Sudoku Gridmaster.
Nintendo recently announced that they're going to be putting this out.
It's going to have over 400 puzzles and use the DS's touchscreen and handwriting recognition software.
You'll have practice mode, easy mode, normal, and hard mode.
The game is supposed to come out June 26.
What I'm not sure of, though, is if that means Japan or the US.
And I'm thinking, come on, another freaking Sudoku game?
I think the only way this game would sell is if they made it look like Tetris DS.
Like, put 16-bit Nintendo characters in it.
Oh, it's Mario presents Sudoku!
And then it would sell like freaking crazy.
What do you want to bet?
Sudoku, just put Link on it, put Zelda's face on it, do something, and people will eat that shit up.
It's the Nintendo way.
The legend of Sudoku.
That's the legend of Sudoku.
I'm going to name my firstborn Sudoku.
Why?
I'm not.
But I am naming my... When I have a son, I'm naming him Richter.
After Richter Belmont.
Because you're a geek.
Can you pronounce it like the bad English dub?
Richter.
Richter.
Where you have to wipe out your eye every time you talk to Maria.
Thank you for knowing where I was going with that.
Before DarkSakura coughs up a lung there with the Richter thing...
The Grudge is like two years old now, stop.
Although they do make a reference to The Grudge in Scary Movie 4, which came out on Friday.
Yes, but I heard it sucks.
I thought it was funny.
I don't know.
You heard wrong.
Well, it's a matter of everyone's opinion.
What did it get on the tomato meter?
That's what I want to know.
I really have no interest in seeing it.
All right.
Loki, more DS, new Mario Brothers.
What's happening with that?
Yeah, they're going to be having some of the mini games in Mario Brothers.
Very similar to what you saw in Super Mario 64 for the DS.
To be honest, I think I played the mini games more than I actually played the games.
But this time around, you'll actually be able to play the multiplayer, which is pretty sweet.
So some mini-game action for you to be shared with friends.
That's going to be fun.
Can't wait.
It's going to be fun-tastic.
Fun-tastic.
Another friend code for you to have to manage with your friends.
That should be a lot of fun.
Well, I don't know if it's over the internet.
I don't think it's through your Wi-Fi service.
I think it's just local.
Oh.
Lame.
All right.
DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down researching Dreamcast games, but once in a while she comes on another website that she wants to share with all of you guys.
It's DarkSakura's website of the week.
And where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week, DarkSakura?
This is the site that's had me mesmerized for about three hours as a few people online, Ranma's one of them, can attest to because I kept linking pictures, Snopes.com, S-N-O-P-E-S.com.
It's basically an urban legends reference page.
It's fabulous.
In fact, someone on my... And I knew about this site for a while, but someone actually linked a picture of the world's largest rabbit, who was like as big as a dog.
Like a golden retriever.
And it's real, and there's lots of interesting pictures in here, like the Cyclops cat, and...
A twin, well, a two-headed baby.
It actually was like a head and half of a body attached to her head.
They actually had the other twin removed.
But yeah, I mean, some of this is, you know, there's the fake ones on here.
It's basically any urban legend that's been reported and they investigate it and let you know if it's real or not.
I love this site because I get those crappy forwards from coworkers all the time of these totally untrue things.
And what I'll do is I'll go onto Snopes.com and find the little article, and I'll just copy-paste the link in an email back, and I always reply to all.
Good.
But just for a little overview, the hottest 25 urban legends as of...
This week is there's one about gas.
There's the giant rabbit.
One about Bill Gates doing a Microsoft and AOL giveaway.
And about the brown recluse spider.
The effects of the brown recluse.
All right.
Check it out.
It should be required reading for anybody who wants to send a forward email.
For the sake of the chat room, I am going to link the giant rabbit story.
All right.
There you go.
Otherwise, you'll have to beg for it in the forums.
I forgot to mention when we were talking about useless games and stuff that's coming out this week, Brain Age is actually coming out this week.
Oh, is it?
Yeah.
Oh, it's this week?
I believe so.
Cool.
Well, so much for useless games coming out.
I really want that one.
It's still not a game.
I want to check it out anyway.
One game I've always been meaning to check out that I seem to never get around to is Civilization 4.
Well, there's actually a patch, see what I'm waiting for is I'm waiting for like the ultimate Civ 4 compilation to come out for 20 bucks in like a year because that's what always happens with Civilization games.
But anyway, if you're a rabid Civilization fan who's getting your fix right now, there's a brand new patch.
and so on.
Subtitles by Subtitle Workshop
This is a good one right here, Civilization IV, Make Your Own Scenarios.
It is down to $30 if you want to pick up the game.
It's down from, I think, $50 when it first came out.
It's down to $29.99, or as I call it, $30.
Moving on, Loki.
Yes.
What's making a comeback?
Hopefully not a weeble, but Alone in the Dark.
I remember they were showing some pictures of Alone in the Dark, the new one, and that actually looked kind of pretty cool, and they have some screenshots up right now.
But 1UP is reporting that Alone in the Dark will rear its head on next-gen consoles very soon.
Something you probably will see at E3, maybe.
But we'll have to wait.
They're going to be showing it in, I think, the next Electronic Gaming Monthly.
Should be interesting.
Are You Alone in the Dark?
Yes, and I'm playing a crappy video game called Alone in the Dark.
If I remember correctly, I did read a little bit about this.
I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
It's actually supposed to be set in Central Park in New York in something about I don't remember now, but something paranormal, of course.
Violent paranormal hobos?
Horrible movies being made.
Who's responsible?
I want to see Typing of the Dead make a comeback.
Sudoku of the Dead
There's actually Guitar Room Man on the PSP.
Basically, on the Japanese PlayStation site, there's a product posting announcing a second Guitar Room Man.
Of course, published by Koei.
Koei gave us KO Flying Squadron.
I like them.
Um...
But as Guitar Man Live for the PSP, follow-up to the first Guitar Man that was on PlayStation 2, there's speculation that there's going to be demos at E3.
Hopefully, that will be true.
I will be living at wherever that is.
But...
there's very few details out on it right now although there's a new feature that's being advertised that has network play but not online compatible and you can compete head to head or cooperative in duet mode it's supposed to be a bit more balanced the music and vocals are provided by actual Japanese pop stars maybe it'll be someone that we've heard of over here
It'll be cool.
I think it's going to be pretty cool.
I'm looking forward to it.
All right.
Sounds good.
Our Skype line is open over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
Click on Interact With Us.
So let's pick up some calls.
Hello.
You are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Sweet.
I'm the first one on.
It's Ranma.
Hi, Ranma.
What's on your mind?
Not much.
I want to cover a couple of things and I'm on my way out of here.
Runtime.
Hi, Ukyo!
Alright, stop.
Less love, more news.
What's up?
Hey!
Alright, I want to talk about the Xbox emulator, and I can explain better why it's taking it so long to convert games, make them all compatible and stuff.
Oh yeah, what is up with that?
On the 360, very few games are compatible.
What's up with that?
Yeah, from my knowledge of working with computers and technology, it's like this.
Xbox is Pentium 3 and Xbox 360 is like a core cell processor, something like that.
Basically, the emulator has to convert the coding and stuff so it'll work.
As for the graphics processor, that part really doesn't matter per se because even though it's optimized for NVIDIA, it's still like a generic graphics set.
It'll still work on the quote-unquote new ATI graphics chipset or whatever.
It's not optimized for NVIDIA.
It's built by NVIDIA.
It's a little different.
I still think it's fucked that you can play Barbie and not DDR.
I mean, fuck that.
I agree.
I mean, I understand why, because, you know, they get one game to work, and usually about ten games are very similar to that, but still, it's messed up.
It's wrong.
It's wrong!
I know, I know.
Alright, anything else, Ranma?
How goes your training against Jack Thompson?
I got 51 odds on you to kick his ass.
I don't know, he's kind of old and broken.
I think I'd win in a fight.
No, we don't want to get sued over threatening to fight him or whatever.
I'm just speculating that if I had to defend myself, if a rabid Jack Thompson came to Sacramento and wanted to beat me up or give me rabies, then I would win in a fight.
He's coming right for us.
Jamie, you didn't hear last week's show, did you?
I was sort of dead.
Rob basically told Jack to bring it on.
Oh yeah, that's right.
I called Jack out.
I said, bring it, bitch.
I said, bring it.
We would own him so hard.
Not physically.
I said, we could have a war of words.
I said I would be cordial to him and let him have his say, but then he would have to listen to everything I have to say in return.
You know what, though?
That wouldn't be fair because, well, we would just completely decimate him.
I know.
You cannot have a battle of wits against an unarmed opponent.
Point taken.
Alright Ranma, we gotta get some more calls, but thank you so much for the call.
No problem.
Love it.
Love you guys.
Bye.
Some folks in the chat room are asking, SSJ100, Matt wants to know, did we do peep jousting this year?
That's actually something that happened on the old show, Vanilla Sky, one of my spinoff shows.
We did not do peep jousting this morning.
And for those that don't know what peep jousting is, that is when you, on Easter, actually, you can do this any day.
Take some marshmallow peeps, but it's easiest around Easter.
Take some marshmallow peeps and stick some toothpicks in them and then put them in the microwave and watch them get really, really, really, really big.
And then at one point, one peep has to slaughter the other.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hey.
Hi, who's this?
This is Did You Lose a Sock?
Did You Lose a Sock?
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
I don't recognize that name.
It's very cool.
Long time podcast listener.
First time listening live.
Very cool.
Well, welcome.
Welcome to the show.
Welcome to the madness.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
I just wanted to call in and say awesome show.
Loved it.
And I think it's stupid that people think Mac gaming is going to die.
That Mac gaming is going to die?
I think it's... Oh, because the whole dual boot thing?
Yeah, I think people are stupid thinking that it will die.
I don't think it will.
You know what?
Commodore 64 gaming is still not dead in many ways.
So Mac gaming will never die either.
There's rabid fans for everything.
I don't think the dual boot thing is going to take off right away.
It's going to be a little while.
I think there will still be some good stuff on Mac.
Yeah, with the switch to the Intel processor, I think actually porting games will make it a lot easier.
So I think we're going to see more games on the Mac.
All right.
We'll see what happens.
I hope so.
All right.
Anything else?
Mr. Sock?
Keep up the good work.
All right.
Thank you very much.
We appreciate the ego boost call once in a while.
Okay.
All right.
Have a good one.
We like new people.
Love it when new people call on the show.
Alright, let's go to another call here.
We'll go over here.
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hey, what's up?
Hi, who's this?
This is HitStun.
Hi, HitStun, what's on your mind?
Hello.
Hey, I got a couple things I wanted to go over here.
Okay.
I want to throw out an idea.
I noticed earlier today, well, earlier this week, about how Walmart dictates the contents of games.
Like, I posted this up on, well, I saw this posted on the forums, too.
But like, they can dictate things like... It's cool, I know what article you're talking about, and for some reason it didn't make this week's show roll, but I do remember reading something on it, like Walmart is, when a AA title comes out, Walmart supposedly gets to review the title before it's released.
You know why I don't... I think one reason we kind of didn't originally intend on covering it is because I don't know if I believe it.
Um, well, I can explain some.
Okay, go for it.
It's like they only have so much shelf space.
Like, they only have room for so many adventure games, so many RPGs, you know, so many strategy games, whatever.
And if something isn't popular enough, they're not going to have the room to carry it.
So, I had an idea.
There should be an independent publisher that's like Cafe Press.
You know how Cafe Press does, like, t-shirts and coffee mugs and stuff for whoever.
Right.
They make it.
Someone should do that for video games.
That's my idea.
Stamp your video game on a 360?
Yeah, exactly.
Anyone who wants to publish their game should be able to send it to this company and have people order it from the site and get copies of it.
I think I'd blow this whole thing wide open.
DarkSakura.com
I don't know about that baby.
I still have my old Zack Bimani t-shirt.
You must hand wash that baby or something.
No, I run it through the washer.
Yeah, take care of that.
Here is why Walmart, you know, how they dictate games.
Okay, so you have this game coming out called Halo 3.
Yeah.
Does it have hunting deer in it?
Because it doesn't.
We don't want to carry it.
I don't buy music at Walmart because I don't agree with their... I really don't shop at Walmart in general because I'm such a Target whore for one.
And I just think Walmart is nasty.
I mean, I don't know about the Walmarts in your neck of the woods, but around here, they are nasty.
You walk in and it smells like dirt.
When you live in Alabama, Walmart's the primary source of entertainment.
I know.
I understand that in some areas, Walmart's your only option.
I'm not joking.
But you guys have online.
We've got some nice independent stores here.
All right.
Well, that's good.
And one more thing, I need to pwn you guys a Tetris DS.
Any of you who have Tetris DS, like, listen in the chat, or, I know Sky, you got it, I gotta take you out.
Let's plan it some way, make a thread in the forums, and we'll plan a night, alright?
Yeah, I mean, eh, whatever, I'm not, like, unbeatable or anything, but
and I gotta take you guys out.
It'll be fun.
We like to show our listeners just how bad at video games we really are.
But I know you guys can turn around and kill me at Mario Kart.
Well, we'll dish it out at some point.
Start a thread in the forums.
We'll try to make it happen.
Alright, thanks guys.
Have a good one, buddy.
Alright, later.
Bye-bye.
Okay, okay.
Ranma Sani heard my accent.
I don't have an accent since I moved to California.
And talking about Walmart nonetheless.
That's wonderful.
Walmart.
All right.
Thank you guys so much for calling in on the Skype line tonight.
We appreciate it, but we've got to get to the last-minute stories.
Does anybody have a last-minute story they'd like to share?
Yeah, Project Gotham 3 is getting an update on Xbox Live.
Basic stuff that they're going to be adding, one of them is the ability to lock the host car in a host car class.
So, again, just what kind of car class you're racing as.
Also...
Added wheel support for some of these brand new steering wheels out there being put out by Madcatz and stuff like that.
Also, finally, they're going to be doing spectator mode.
So I know that.
Fear is coming to the 360.
It's supposed to be shown at E3.
That's supposed to be the story I think 1UP was talking about.
We're going to be
PC Games 360 Liberty City Stories
I hope that's not true because that game's awesome.
I hope it has online multiplayer because I'm going to fucking kick everybody's ass.
Everybody's ass.
I remember one of the videos that we had of me drunk.
Hey, how about a game of Grand Theft Auto right now?
I'm like, I'll fucking kick your ass, even if I am drunk.
That was fun.
DarkSakura?
There were 5,400 World of Warcraft players banned.
Oh my gosh, what did they do?
Basically, they were trying to clamp down on gold farming and cheating.
And funeral party raiding.
10,700 accounts were suspended for participating in activities that violate the game's terms of use, including using third-party programs to farm gold and items.
According to Blizzard, and I quote, such actions can severely impact the economy of a realm and the overall game enjoyment for all players.
and selling World of Warcraft content such as gold items and characters can result in permanent ban of the involved accounts.
If you want to cheat like that, you better go play Oblivion.
However, a new patch, 1.10.1, is released.
The Jagged Obsidian Shield is now bind-on equipped, and the Titanic Leggings pattern will now drop slightly less frequently, which is obviously, you know, it's going to...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
A little bit more news.
1.11 is coming out soon, which is basically mage-specific.
There will be a talent review.
Patch is going to introduce a new 40-man raid dungeon, the Necropolis of Naxxramas, which is home to the Dreaded Lich, unpronounceable name insert here.
All right.
There's also a little bit more.
Capcom's going to be loading us with stuff at E3.
And you know what?
I hate Firefox all of a sudden.
What did it do?
Crash on you?
Yes!
Oh no!
So let's see if I can get around this.
I'll just go ahead and leave it off of there.
Alright, I can do a fill-in real quick if you get to bring it up.
Nah, I'm not even going to play with it.
Alright.
GoNintendo has an interesting little quote from Ubisoft Montreal CEO's Yanis Mallet.
I can say definitely as any other developer, we are looking at this magical platform and we want to be a part of the adventure.
I'm pretty sure we'll see other Revolution games from Ubisoft and some of them I'm sure will be made from Montreal.
So he's quoting there that the Revolution is a magical platform.
It's full of magic.
And they're going to make magic games.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and Spike.
Die, monster.
You don't belong in this world.
And... It was not by my hand that I was given flesh.
Nerds!
Nerds!
Loki.
Um... Well... Ooh, video.
We'll have to... I'm really trying to get this on the website.
Alright.
You do that, Mr. Loki.
Alright, that's going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you guys so much for downloading us, checking us out, tuning in live, breaking some record numbers for us listening live tonight.
I really appreciate that, you guys.
Again, all we ask, if you enjoy the show, we do it for free.
Just tell a friend.
Tell somebody you know about Orange Lounge Radio because that's really the best way for us to advertise because we don't have any big sites backing us and we don't have those ads and things.
So unless Loki can manage to leak some more release dates, we don't get attention very often.
So we need you guys to help us out.
DarkSakura?
I almost forgot.
Reject false icons.
Oh, there you go.
And on that note, that's going to do it.
Have a good week.
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
