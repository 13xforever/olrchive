and many more.
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!

Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Mention the fact that you nearly fell off the chair.
I don't know how I almost fell into the wall.
An extra person here talking about using it as a battery for your vibrator.
Let's talk about Wondershowsin.
Oh yeah, let's talk about Wondershowsin.
I just took over the show.
How about that?
Wondershowsin is awesome.
Are you Wondershowsin?
Then you're so awesome.
Like a hot dog.
I don't think you're cool.
Sorry, not as cool as Wondershoes, which is your fairly hot.
I am moderately hot.
So anyway... Hey everybody, I just took over the show.
How's about that?
I think everybody should tell me how cool I am.
You start.
I'm not going to do this again.
Oh, that was great.
I love the kid that was dressed up like Hitler.
Trevor is the best beat kid on that show.
Thank you for returning, Rob.
I like the kid about pills, though.
He's my favorite.
Pills!
Pills!
Pills!
Shut up.
I think the power brick should be bigger than the PSP.
It should be like a 360 or an Xbox that you just slap to the back of the PSP.
That should be a nuclear generator.
Like the power packs in Ghostbusters.
Power bricks made out of solid metal.
It just gets super hot and you can cook eggs on it.
Mmm, eggs.
Mmm, eggy.
Hello?
Hello, is this thing on?
Testing.
Testing 1-2.
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
Hello?
I don't understand this.
Does this thing work?
This thing reads like stereo instructions.
Is this on?
What the hell?
Orange Lounge Radio, Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
What the?
That's one of our old promos.
Gotta love that.
Oh, RetroOLR.
I missed the beep.
The beep was from R10K.
Alright, alright.
No, for reals.
We gotta get through this or I swear to God we'll be here all night.
Alright, here we go.
I thought that was QQQ.
Alright, shut up.
Everybody, shut up.
It's my time.
Loki has this look at, you're gonna fuck up.
You're gonna fuck up.
And then I fucked up.
I wasn't doing anything.
You were giving me that look.
You were like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
I'm not doing anything.
You willed it to happen.
I was just watching him talk.
I swear to God I quit.
All right.
Woo-hoo, we have DarkSakura Radio.
All right, no, we don't.
All right, here we go.
I was not even looking at you.
Alright, you know what?
Fuckin' A. I'm turning around.
I'm turning around.
Dude.
Why do we have you on this program anyway?
Okay, this is you talking.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Here's DarkSakura.
Right at you.
She's like, how am I not supposed to laugh at that?
For the sake of the chat room, I was leaning over my laptop, staring at Rob intently.
I don't want to be a duck.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
This is not a drunk show.
Stop filming.
I'm going to turn around and not look at you people so I can get through this segment.
So, Loki, be ready with a Tomb Raider story and no more giggling.
Yeah, we have a Tomb Raider story.
Alright, here we go.
Okay.
Seriously.
Jesus.
Alright.
Know how Bobby Black by himself.
I'm starting to wonder if that's not a bad idea.
I'm pushing your head.
Alright.
Here we go.
And we're back here with the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth.
It's that portion of the show that's too hot to podcast.
It's sticky.
It's perverted.
We have the cage match coming up, which is pretty much going to be just about all we do tonight because we're already at 9 o'clock.
That was an awfully long show tonight.
Maybe if you would quit laughing so much during the show.
That's true.
It's not the show itself.
When it comes out on the stream, don't stop it.
When it comes out on the podcast stream, it won't be very long, but it was like 20 minutes of giggle fits.
That's alright.
I recorded it on my fancy video camera.
Okay, what is it?
Are we going to do a video cast then?
Is that the next step?
No.
We don't have to, but this is mainly for E3.
Get me a burka then.
Because as we know, we were talking about what we're doing, our plans for E3, special plans that no one's doing yet.
That's mainly what it's for, so I can walk through the entire booth and cover everything and that kind of stuff.
I love that video camera.
The only problem is the still pictures it takes aren't 100% good.
They're like 640x480, not really even a 1 megapixel.
But when I figured I'm cropping down most of the pictures anyways, I don't think it really matters.
So, I don't know.
But it'll be pretty cool.
In random news, it's Bomani related, Sephiroth1215 sent me a private message in chat.
I hope you don't mind me sharing that.
But he sent me a link over to Konami's website here.
And Konami has a page here for DDR Supernova.
And it says, release date, available now.
Lies.
I think there's a webmaster at Konami that's about to get fired.
Hooray.
Why don't you email somebody about that?
Why would I email anybody about that?
Can't you fix that?
You work for him?
Can't you fire somebody?
All right.
I sent you a link to my Flash thingy and you never said anything.
When?
I sent you an IM a few days ago.
Was I at work?
That's because he's rude.
What?
And I leave my IM up.
I'm going to pull it up and I'm going to show you on my laptop.
Well, you know you need to friend me now once you get a game.
Once I get a game.
You don't even have to get a game.
Buy some of those Xbox Live arcade games.
I'll probably get Geometry Wars.
Didn't you download the ghost recon thing or something?
Hold on, I'm busy.
Talk to me later.
I was going to do a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, but I don't think I really care about these people anymore.
So, let's get into tonight's cage match, shall we?
Okay, what were you talking about?
Now I'm not busy.
I'm going to put that on my resume and I want you to have people hire me.
All right.
Cache Match!
I vote for Holic.
I'm gonna get busted.
Three songs, do battle.
and now I have the giggles again.
Three songs do battle.
Each host picks their favorite song.
Hey, Cage Match.
Fine.
Three hosts pick their favorite song.
They do battle.
Your guys' votes in the chat room determine the winner.
And it goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music program.
Started off with song number one, which won the Cage Match last week.
It was Babyland.
Yes?
Yes, Babyland, who I'm going to see on April 15th in Berkeley.
Alright, Babyland had this song called Gary?
Is that how you say it?
Gary?
Gary, Gary.
Alright, well it won last week's Cage Match with its funky indie sound.
I think I said it sounded like the Postal Service on crack or something, I don't remember.
But here it is.
A lot of their stuff is more industrial sounding, but this I thought was very synth poppy.
Alright, here it is.
Have a good one.
Song number one, Babyland.
Enjoy.
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Alright, song number two in tonight's cage match is coming up.
That, once again, was song number one, Babyland, with Jerry.
And song number two is going to be a challenger, and it's my pick.
And it's a band called Goldfrap.
Actually, I think Goldfrap is just the name of the girl.
You know she's got a lot of people helping her out.
Goldfrap has a song from her new CD, Supernature is the CD.
The song is called Ooh La La.
And I like this song.
It's kind of pornotastic.
So it's my pick tonight.
Ooh La La by Goldfrap.
Enjoy.
Or don't.
See if I care.
Ooh La La
I want to touch you, you're just made for love
Thanks for watching!
That was it, that was uh...
Song number two there in the cage match, Ooh La La by GoldFrap.
I love that ending, though.
Yeah, you know what, that was part of a song I'm not supposed to be playing.
Whoops!
Anyway, what did you guys think of Ooh La La by GoldFrap?
Miklatov, she needs to quit smoking, one.
Loki, what did you think of Oolala by GoldPrap?
I recognized... I don't know, it was okay.
It's good stripper music, I guess.
It should be called GoldFap.
I guess it would be like 7.5.
Jamie, how would you rate the bathroom?
Or wherever you just were.
I could hear the music from the bathroom, thank you.
What did you like?
It was poopy.
No, I'm kidding.
I actually liked what I heard of it.
It was a little repetitive, but it gets an 8.
That is totally fucking music.
I give it a 9.
Oh shit, I forgot kids listen to this show, my bad.
Alright, song number three tonight comes from Cheater Loki.
Cheater, Cheater, Cheater Loki.
Hey, listen.
Do not support Cheater Loki tonight.
Listen, I did the same thing when Kingdom Hearts 1 came out, okay?
So obviously my choice is going to be Utada Hikaru with Passion, because that is a team song.
Alright, here's song number three from Cheating Loki.
Utada Hikaru with Passion.
Enjoy.
Thank you for watching!
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Alright, song number three tonight, Utada Hikaru with Passion.
Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that.
Who started us off last time?
Miklatov.
It was long and had bad camera angles.
It's a one.
Loki.
I love that song.
I love the guitar.
That's the only thing I remember of it each time.
Yet you used the version without the guitar bridge in the middle, like in the opening video.
You know what?
I was pressed for time.
Yeah, I had a feeling.
I had a hunch.
DarkSakura.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I gave it a 9.
DarkSakura.
I really like this song, although as far as I thought that Hikaru was better as far as an opening song.
This...
You know, I really like the song, it's a problem, but I just don't like things about it.
So it gets a 7.
I think the opening song to Kingdom Hearts 2 should have been Easy Breezy.
Because I think that would have been much better.
Come on, you could have like Sora skipping down.
It's not as dramatic.
Alright, no, I...
I like that song a lot, but it's already in rotation, so I give it a five.
Alright, don't get me wrong, I love that song, but Loki sucks.
Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.
Babyland with Jerry, song number one.
Alright, and song number two you can vote for tonight is Gold Frap with Ooh La La is the name of that song.
Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is from Loki, and it's Utada Hikaru with Passion.
I wasn't listening.
DarkSakura has a memory like an elephant.
She don't forget.
It's a slightly different version.
What are you talking about?
You don't forget.
Shut up.
I think the one we have in rotation does have the guitar riff.
I think it's the one from the movie.
It's the short one.
Sigh.
All right.
And, dude, I'm going to hit FoodManiac64 with a trout now for being a butt.
All right.
Do so.
Because he told everyone not to vote for my song so they'd play his.
But I haven't guaranteed that I'll play his song.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I told people I'd play their songs like three months ago, and I still haven't.
Just keep dangling out there.
He emailed me four times.
Tell him to stop.
Block him.
Ah.
All right.
Uh, since I need some time here to tabulate votes, I need filler, so we're gonna go around and do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.
DarkSakura, how was your week, how was your day?
Shitty!
I mean, poopy.
No, my week was actually pretty good.
I've got more stuff to do.
You know, my whole crappy work situation has improved to such a degree that I no longer feel like I'm going to kill people and then myself in a big emo fit.
Instead, I just feel like, you know, I'm going to mildly maim people and, you know, not, like, actually kill them, you know.
I'm no longer disgruntled.
I'm slightly annoyed, but not disgruntled.
I've also been playing a lot of Ragnarok online.
As of today, my primary character is 5441.
I still have to get job 50 before I can go assassin.
I donated some money to their server, so I got a bunch of free stuff for it.
I have a kiddie band now, and it makes me a very happy bunny.
I have a kitty band.
I need to see pictures.
I will send you pictures.
And I got a bunch of cards too.
I have a thief bug card and no footwear that I can put it on.
And now I need a zombie card.
Because zombies are awesome.
Like a hot dog.
Loki, how was your week?
How was your day?
My weekend day was okay.
I've got to move my desk tomorrow because we do this thing every once in a while once we fire a bunch of people where we do the floor layout shuffle.
Those are fun.
Yeah, for no apparent reason.
They'll move people one desk over just...
for the hell of it.
And it's kind of fun.
But anyway, so I gotta move my desk.
And I get my review next week, which should be interesting because my phone time sucks, but I'm the smartest one there.
So, you know, it kind of evens out.
And, um...
I don't know.
It'll be cool.
We're supposed to be getting our bonuses.
My co-worker taught me this really cool thing with our bonus because they take out twice the amount of taxes as they normally would on your bonus checks.
So where I potentially could get $2,000, I only get like $1,100 or something.
So what you do is you put out another W4 or whatever for...
You know, exempt for that week, so I get my full $2,000, which is going to a laptop.
And, um... What else?
Oh yeah, I got my spiffy camera, which you'll hopefully see some more content for the PSP site.
That's what the, uh... One of the main reasons was for that, so I can record some of my stuff at, you know... Well, I'm probably going to record stuff at my bachelor party, because...
What happens at Bachelor Party stays at Bachelor Party.
And also... Do you know what they have planned for your Bachelor Party?
No, I don't.
I do, but that's all I can say.
Okay.
Anyways, the other thing is just your recording wedding stuff.
Just it's really fun to play with that camera because it has a 20 gig hard drive in there so you can store tons of video.
Lots of video coming from E3, that's for sure.
So look forward to that and lots of pictures.
And...
Yeah, I think that's about all I have.
Mikotov, how was your week?
My week was boring.
Work is boring.
I'm sick of it.
And then today, slash last night, got myself hyped up to go to Best Buy and wait in a non-existent line at 3 in the morning.
That didn't go so well.
Best Buy sucks.
And then tomorrow, somebody new that we hired is going to be sitting in my office and I'm not looking forward to that because I hate new people and I will not talk to them.
You're not a team player.
I don't need to be a team player.
They invaded my space.
They can go away.
And, uh, I, um... Oh, we started playing Tetris DS at work.
And it's over already.
Because a lot of people suck and whine too much like me.
Back to Apples and Apples.
Apples to Apples is occasionally played.
We recently discovered the joy of Team Mario Kart.
at break.
That's really fun.
Team Mario Kart.
Yeah, and reverses.
When you're setting up the options like 150 and computer difficulty if you have computers and all that, there's an option for team.
And so you can actually do a four-on-four team.
And it's pretty much like a regular race, except you have a color icon, like red or blue, and you can still attack your own teammates, but how it works is it's an overall point total for your team.
That's kind of cool.
You're no longer working just to be the best.
You're working as a team.
So...
We started out last week when the losers were still playing Tetris, me and the person in my room, or in my office.
We played it with computers and he got screwed over twice with really bad computer players, but it's really fun actually, and I didn't even think Mario Kart could be more fun than it already was.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So now we're playing without power-ups because, you know, they got pissed off at that because I won the rankings this month.
So this next month now, we're just trying to... I want to do team games, but the problem is we don't get enough people to participate.
You can only do six, and some people are gone or busy and stuff, and that kind of makes it unfair.
But, I don't know, we're looking forward to, like, maybe Liberty City Stories when it comes out on PlayStation 2.
Hopefully we'll have multiplayer, and then we can land together some PS2s and play it that way.
I don't know.
Might be fun.
That could be fun.
Rob, how was your weekend?
It was fine.
Besides the whole male PMS thing, I was fine.
I had a fine week.
I went to the gym today and my trainer pretty much told me officially today that I'm fat, which was good to hear.
That's what I was referring to.
No, I had to take the little machine that measures your body fat.
And you hold it in your hands like away from your body.
Yeah, exactly.
And it did the little boop, boop, boop thing.
The BMI scale.
Yep, and then I turned it.
Yep, and he looked at the number and then he turned it around and said.
Yep, you're right here in the high one.
I'm like, thanks.
But oh well.
I mean, I already knew that was coming anyway.
That's the whole reason I signed up for the gym.
So I just have to make sure I go regularly.
That's pretty cool that you have a trainer, though.
That would be the only thing I'd be able to do.
Well, I only get them one more time for free.
Then I'd have to pay for them if I want to keep them.
Rob, if you come to my gym with me, I'll work out with you and show you what to do.
It's not that I don't know what to do, I just, you know, I need the motivation is a huge thing.
Put a cupcake in front of you.
I promise you, next Monday, nothing will stand in between us going to spin.
All right.
Word.
You know, they do spin at this gym, too.
But you have to go to my trainer's spin.
She's vicious.
I asked my trainer if you could come to this club, and he said with a guest pass you can.
So you'll have to come to one of our classes sometime, see if you enjoy it.
All right.
Bring me a guest pass.
Okay.
You got it.
You're on.
And we'll pick a class to do.
And in the summer we can go swimming.
We can do yoga or something.
I got all the stuff to do lap swimming.
They're outdoors, though.
I thought it was indoors when I signed up.
One of the ones I have a membership for over here has a lap pool outside.
It's the snooty one, though.
We need to do the indoor pool somewhere.
Roseville.
I'm going to Roseville.
I think Roseville has three indoor pools.
Oh, hi.
Shall we announce who won tonight's cage match?
That would be a good way to get close to the end here.
Sure.
The winning song of tonight's cage match was...
A tie!
And here are the two songs... Okay, you know how ties work.
Here's song number one that tied.
Baby Man.
Here's song number two that tied.
Passion, Utada Hikaru.
And in the old Orange Lounge Radio rulebook... I wonder where this is going.
That means that when two songs tie, the host who got screwed over... Oh, that's me.
Gets to break the tie...
Now, see, I could be ironic and vote for your pick, Loki.
And then Jamie could hate me all night.
That might be fun.
But, no, I can't do that because, you know, you totally picked a song that was already in rotation, so I think you both end up winning anyway.
So I am picking for Jamie's song, I'm picking Jamie's song, Babyland, because I like the fact that they sound like Postal Service on track.
All right, so two weeks in a row.
All right.
Babyland for the win!
Two weeks in a row, not too shabby.
So everybody has to go to their show in Berkeley.
Now the stripper song was only one vote behind.
So it was close.
We were all up there.
We're all winners.
Except Rob's not as much of a winner.
It was one vote for Pat, that one song, one vote for Jamie's song, and zero votes for yours.
Yeah, something like that.
And that was both of our listeners right there.
Sweet.
Alright, it's about 9.30 and I think it's time to call it a night.
What do you kids think?
I want ice cream.
I'm thirsty.
I'm hungry.
I want a cupcake.
I think they're... No, I think I ate the last one.
Bastard!
No, it's fine.
I need... Oh, I want Boba.
That's 23rd Magus.
I hear you there.
Oh, you know, TAPEX is open.
Stop it!
Stop it, all of you!
I just got told I'm fat today!
We'll get you some nice wheatgrass.
I don't want wheatgrass.
I want bulimia right about now.
Alright.
Then fine, I'll get you a bottle of Ipecac.
Alright.
And a toothbrush.
That's disgusting.
You said you wanted bulimia.
Alright, sorry chat room, I ignored your FUs tonight, maybe next week.
Tonight was supposed to be a slow news night, we went on forever, but of course I think that little giggle fit had something to do with it.
Your giggle fit, okay Rob.
My giggle fit?
Yeah, you were the only one laughing in the microphone.
We were laughing at you.
I have your giggle fit on camera, so.
Alright, shut up.
Partial.
Alright, here it is.
Your fortune cookie message.
I almost said your moment of zen.
Your fortune cookie message.
Do you still want to be a duck?
Of the day.
I don't want to be a duck.
We're tiny, we're toony, we're all a little loony And in this cartoony, we're invading your TV We're comic dispensers, we crack up all the censors On I'm a Toon Adventures, get a dose of comedy So here's at the anchors, it's a whole wide world apart Our homes, we only stand alone, a cartoon work of art
