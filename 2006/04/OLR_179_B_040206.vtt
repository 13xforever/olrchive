00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
And we're back here with Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 179, April the 2nd, 2006.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.280
Remember, guys, we're coming off of April Fool's Day, so take everything you hear tonight

00:31.280 --> 00:33.120
with a grain of salt.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.200
One thing that is the real deal, though, we have a special guest here joining us for Part

00:36.200 --> 00:39.000
B. Say hello, everybody, to OLR favorite Miklotov.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Miklotov Hello.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
How you doing?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Miklotov I'm fine.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.200
And Miklotov, of course, works over at Konami.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.200
Miklotov Yes.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.000
But due to NDAs, can't really tell us anything.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Miklotov Yes.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.160
Are there any good games coming out this year from Konami?

00:50.160 --> 00:51.160
Miklotov Yes.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.160
Miklotov Yes.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.240
Okay, I guess that's about all we can figure out.

00:55.240 --> 00:59.240
Can you tell us anything about sequels to popular franchises?

00:59.240 --> 01:03.240
No. Can you tell us anything about Metal Gear 4? No.

01:03.240 --> 01:07.240
So he'll be giving us one word answers all night long. He can tell you that it is coming out.

01:07.240 --> 01:11.240
Well that's public information, we've all seen the trailer.

01:11.240 --> 01:15.240
Alright. How's Beatmania?

01:15.240 --> 01:19.240
How's that doing? Yes.

01:19.240 --> 01:23.240
You can talk about Beatmania now, it's out. I don't know, how is it

01:23.240 --> 01:30.800
doing I have my coffee it sure is a great turntable controller all right

01:30.800 --> 01:33.920
speaking of amiglotov will be chiming in throughout the segment tonight he's

01:33.920 --> 01:37.240
gonna help us with a little game later on but for meanwhile let's let's keep

01:37.240 --> 01:42.080
talking about music games one often overlooked music game on the ps2 might

01:42.080 --> 01:49.240
be coming back soon dark soccer yeah maybe if I'm good if you eat your

01:49.240 --> 01:54.640
vegetables and clean your room and make your bed I'll try guitar a man live to

01:54.640 --> 02:00.140
PSP there are listings being put up by several of the Japanese retailers for a

02:00.140 --> 02:06.260
PSP title called guitar a man live due out in Japan at the end of May no

02:06.260 --> 02:13.000
details out nothing official has been said about it but the hints there you

02:13.000 --> 02:17.220
never know I'm surprised we haven't seen a prep of the rapper game for a PSP

02:17.220 --> 02:21.220
That's a good point as well. Why drag the system sales down further?

02:21.220 --> 02:23.220
Hey! Parappa's awesome! You shut up.

02:23.220 --> 02:25.220
I like how I'm Jammer Lammy. I don't like Parappa.

02:25.220 --> 02:29.220
Do you think maybe the success of Guitar Hero is causing people to go, hmm, maybe we should go...

02:29.220 --> 02:37.220
Of course, this is Japan now, not the US, but I would assume that if this comes out in Japan, we'd luck out and get it here in the US, too.

02:37.220 --> 02:39.220
They need to bring out the Taiko No Tatsujin.

02:39.220 --> 02:40.220
For the PSP?

02:40.220 --> 02:41.220
Yeah.

02:41.220 --> 02:43.220
Oh, that's right, they have one. Well, what's the point? There's no drum!

02:43.220 --> 02:44.220
So?

02:44.220 --> 02:45.220
So there's no drum!

02:45.220 --> 02:46.220
It was fun.

02:46.220 --> 02:52.940
tyke there's no Tyco in Tyco you hook it up to the USB yeah yeah speaking of

02:52.940 --> 02:59.100
speaking of release you know rhythm music games I saw this at GameStop when

02:59.100 --> 03:04.260
I went there the other day to get my game they have this thing called the

03:04.260 --> 03:09.140
drum pad it's a dance pad but you don't dance on it you kneel next to it you hit

03:09.140 --> 03:14.500
it with drumsticks is that not the lamest thing I have I mean have you

03:14.500 --> 03:19.920
isn't that just a freestyle routine it's a really bad routine stupid and I can't

03:19.920 --> 03:28.180
believe that they're selling that but I try it you would all right so I hope

03:28.180 --> 03:33.780
that I hope that really I really do hope so and also I have to say that for the

03:33.780 --> 03:39.460
message board for where we found this uh-huh I do think that whoever posted

03:39.460 --> 03:44.660
this filler bunny it has the best name ever but anyway um you know I'm really

03:44.660 --> 03:50.020
hoping that we see it because I mean the one problem with that though for anyone

03:50.020 --> 03:56.820
who played guitar a man is they would have to really I think well the PSP has

03:56.820 --> 04:00.140
good speakers on it though this is the thing because the Eurobeat on initial D

04:00.140 --> 04:05.460
was sounding really good so that really though have to outdo themselves to make

04:05.460 --> 04:09.100
the music sound as good as it did on the first one well Zander C is suggesting in

04:09.100 --> 04:11.920
chat room over at orange launch radio click on chat here's what they should

04:11.920 --> 04:15.980
call the sequel guitar o man fuck the sand bone trio is it anybody who's

04:15.980 --> 04:21.040
played guitar o man had oh my through that stage I was getting hung up on the

04:21.040 --> 04:26.740
stupid para para stage our UFO isn't that like the second stage I know I

04:26.740 --> 04:30.420
love that song it's like it's like right at the end of it yeah not as good as the

04:30.420 --> 04:34.360
Eurobeat song that's in there though that is the Eurobeat the fly there's

04:34.360 --> 04:35.360
There's another song in there.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.360
No, that's what you're thinking of.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.480
No, that's the Eurobeat stage with the Para Para UFO.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.480
My bad, my bad.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.480
Para Para Eurobeat.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.480
Okay.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.480
It's such a good song.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.480
I know it is.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.480
All right.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.480
For the Zambon Trio.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.280
That game is so good.

04:47.280 --> 04:52.720
Moving on, another game that I think a lot more people are looking forward to, Loki,

04:52.720 --> 04:54.080
we might have some news on.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.080
Yes.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.800
There's a lot more fans of this one than Guitar Man.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.560
I got to follow up on something we talked about.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.560
Okay.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.560
Remember the Forerunner rumor, supposedly?

05:00.560 --> 05:01.560
Yeah.

05:01.560 --> 05:02.560
That actually was in-game.

05:02.560 --> 05:03.560
Well, there was that Halo thing, right?

05:03.560 --> 05:10.460
Okay, halo 3 that actually the whole article was in game informer and I actually got the read it. I don't know

05:11.260 --> 05:14.960
What source they're taking it from whether I don't think it's gonna be

05:15.680 --> 05:18.280
You know what? Halo 3 is obviously they're gonna call it

05:18.280 --> 05:24.140
Halo 3 or Halo 4 runner or something like that, which will be Halo 3 like Ghost Recon advanced war fighter type thing

05:24.920 --> 05:26.920
anyways, so

05:27.560 --> 05:30.020
Supposedly the word on the street is

05:30.020 --> 05:38.460
that IGN once again their anonymous source has found that that halo 3 is

05:38.460 --> 05:43.900
supposed to be shipping March 2007 and is the story the story is not dated

05:43.900 --> 05:48.500
April 1st no the story came out March 30th however it is close enough to that

05:48.500 --> 05:55.220
but it sounds about right time wise I guess yeah they want to save it for the

05:55.220 --> 06:00.980
holiday season? I mean it'll sell either way but you always pick your

06:00.980 --> 06:04.340
biggest things at the holiday season I thought. Not if they think Sony or

06:04.340 --> 06:09.100
Nintendo's plotting something around the same time frame. Maybe they think that

06:09.100 --> 06:12.940
maybe that's when the PlayStation 3 is actually gonna launch. Who knows, who

06:12.940 --> 06:15.860
knows. Yeah I'm kind of surprised they wouldn't try to release it in time for

06:15.860 --> 06:18.100
Christmas but of course you know something like Halo you don't want to

06:18.100 --> 06:23.140
screw that up. Technically that is in time for Christmas, just really early.

06:23.140 --> 06:27.900
Wrong year, wrong year. Remember the rumors that the Halo 3 was supposed to

06:27.900 --> 06:28.740
disrupt

06:28.740 --> 06:33.180
the Sony PlayStation 3 launch? Didn't Gates say that or something?

06:33.180 --> 06:37.220
I don't know. I'm really very happy if everything's been kept under wraps

06:37.220 --> 06:40.620
like I think it has. Well, you think that this is

06:40.620 --> 06:44.880
Microsoft's big thing at E3 because they don't have a new system to show off

06:44.880 --> 06:47.180
this year. Now they've got to give us a big game. Or so we

06:47.180 --> 06:50.460
so we know. Oh, that's true. They could have their portable that everybody's been

06:50.460 --> 06:51.460
rumoring about, but...

06:51.460 --> 06:56.740
Um, I think Halo 3 is definitely gonna be the thing that they kick off the focus of their

06:57.940 --> 06:59.940
Announcements. It's gotta be I mean

07:00.420 --> 07:06.560
All right, because that's what else are you gonna do in places? They're gonna be like, oh look how pretty everything is and you know

07:07.220 --> 07:09.220
Nintendo's gonna be look how innovative everything is

07:10.300 --> 07:12.460
Microsoft can be like look we have Halo 3

07:13.180 --> 07:14.900
so

07:14.900 --> 07:16.900
And the fanboys go. Yeah

07:16.900 --> 07:23.340
Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention, three more games have been added to the compatibility

07:23.340 --> 07:24.340
list.

07:24.340 --> 07:25.340
Oh, really?

07:25.340 --> 07:33.300
Winning 11-9, so some soccer for you, Black, and, god damn it, I forgot the last one.

07:33.300 --> 07:34.300
That's alright.

07:34.300 --> 07:39.900
Now, so, that whole, like, oh, Xbox 360 is going to be constantly updated with, you know,

07:39.900 --> 07:40.900
new backwards compatible.

07:40.900 --> 07:41.900
Bullshit!

07:41.900 --> 07:43.900
We got three in the past couple months.

07:43.900 --> 07:45.900
Okay, yeah, sure.

07:45.900 --> 07:50.460
okay interesting it was just in time for their third relaunch of the system so I

07:50.460 --> 07:55.540
can I can I can play Barbie but I still can't play DDR for Silent Hill all right

07:55.540 --> 07:59.740
okay um speaking of which you bring this up we touched on this in the first part

07:59.740 --> 08:03.700
of the show and I tried to kind of retell your experiences but how was it

08:03.700 --> 08:06.860
at Best Buy this morning how did you come to find out that they were gonna be

08:06.860 --> 08:11.180
doing the sale and all that good stuff um well I have a relative who works at

08:11.180 --> 08:15.980
Best Buy and he informed me that Best Buy was doing yet another relaunch type

08:15.980 --> 08:21.640
deal of the Xbox 360 and it was very hush-hush apparently. When we got there

08:21.640 --> 08:26.780
it was only like 8.30 and nobody was there and by the time the place opened

08:26.780 --> 08:30.840
there was about 10 people in line and they had about I think about 90 systems

08:30.840 --> 08:39.320
and my first one was defective kind of in my own weird way and so I mean when I

08:39.320 --> 08:42.680
I took it back right before they closed and they still had plenty of systems, so

08:43.560 --> 08:45.560
There's a shortage over from what you saw

08:46.200 --> 08:50.440
At that Best Buy. Yeah, right. There's nobody in there today. So

08:51.360 --> 08:53.400
But I assume it's getting better now

08:54.420 --> 09:00.380
After today, well, enjoy your 360. Maybe the second one that you're on now. I have to see if it works still

09:00.380 --> 09:06.300
What games did you get? This is nothing and you tell us your gamer tags all the DDR fanboys can start adding you

09:06.300 --> 09:12.620
Are you gonna get rumble roses xx no cuz I worked on that game, and I know it's not a good game Wow

09:14.940 --> 09:16.020
Here's the point though

09:16.020 --> 09:20.980
I know I can give that game for free because Konami loves our company and they send us free stuff and

09:21.460 --> 09:28.420
Usually the people that work with me don't like the Konami stuff because they aren't into like you know music games and stuff and no

09:28.420 --> 09:33.780
One has a 360 so I'm looking forward to getting rumble roses for free because I'm not buying the game

09:33.780 --> 09:38.100
But um, I mean, no, it's just not you know, I didn't play dead or alive 4

09:38.100 --> 09:42.340
I thought oh I got to get this game cuz you know, it's a really good fighting game. No, I didn't like it

09:42.860 --> 09:45.720
But it looked fun because at least they're

09:46.660 --> 09:54.160
Nipple-icious, I don't know the good thing about rumble roses double X is that it has really nice lighting and

09:54.900 --> 09:57.260
Sometimes good graphics. I that's it

09:57.260 --> 10:01.300
I want to make the most offensive looking character to play online me

10:01.300 --> 10:08.100
Let's have your line because you you you told me yourself the photo mode was oh, oh, yeah photo mode if you're a dirty dirty

10:08.440 --> 10:10.440
pervert

10:10.660 --> 10:16.980
It is really good for you because you can take really really bad pictures and share them with your friends

10:17.740 --> 10:24.200
When we were testing it, I guess some reviewers in Mexico had already gotten it. I don't know why Mexico has systems

10:25.660 --> 10:27.260
but

10:27.260 --> 10:28.300
like

10:28.300 --> 10:32.020
They had pictures for us to download and I swear

10:33.180 --> 10:36.180
Seen things that bad in a long time

10:40.700 --> 10:42.380
Wow

10:42.380 --> 10:48.240
Dark Sakura any interest in taking dirty photos on rumble roses double X and sending them to all your friends. No

10:49.180 --> 10:53.380
That sure beats, you know seeing the spam check out my burnout clip

10:53.380 --> 10:58.020
I I wish I so wish things that worked out so you could have gone away saying it

10:58.020 --> 11:03.020
So what you're saying is you can actually spread those clips online. Yeah, you can download them

11:03.440 --> 11:04.760
they have like

11:04.760 --> 11:10.260
This place where you can just download photos that people have uploaded and you can do whatever you want with them now

11:10.260 --> 11:12.260
Now, can you download them if you don't have the game?

11:12.600 --> 11:19.240
No, cuz it's a it's like a an option in the game to ah, damn because we could have a totally awesome contest

11:19.720 --> 11:26.620
You know rubber roses xx dirty photo contest who can make you do it also put like outlines around your pictures

11:26.620 --> 11:29.940
So when we were testing it we had two of the chicks, you know

11:29.940 --> 11:33.740
Really close to each other and we put a heart around it. It was pretty funny and cute

11:34.260 --> 11:38.460
But that game is worthless. It's so confusing and not fun

11:40.500 --> 11:42.500
Interesting

11:42.920 --> 11:47.460
Like the actual game, all right, let's move on talk about some other news

11:47.500 --> 11:51.660
Do you guys remember the whole flowers for Jack like that was like weeks ago?

11:51.660 --> 11:52.660
We actually gave money to that

11:52.660 --> 11:56.660
Well now it turned into this whole other thing that pixel on T is now what they're calling themselves

11:56.660 --> 12:03.220
Well, they're selling shirts now and game politics ran a story on this earlier in the week. They are selling their t-shirts

12:03.220 --> 12:05.380
They are able to be purchased now on

12:05.660 --> 12:10.860
Zazzle which I think is a competitor to cafe e-press or whatever that is. So Zazzle sells us now

12:10.860 --> 12:14.620
you can see it at zazzle comm slash pixel anti charity and

12:15.300 --> 12:19.180
Shirts are around $15. But here's the part for every

12:19.880 --> 12:21.880
sociopath with a mouse as

12:21.880 --> 12:29.280
Jack Thompson calls it for everyone that buys one of these shirts game politics is going to donate all the profits to the get well

12:29.280 --> 12:34.220
Gamers foundation just to rub it in Jack Thompson's face that gamers are always up to no good

12:34.220 --> 12:40.480
So here's a chance to you know, get a shirt and give to charity at the same time and show yourself as a proud pixel anti

12:41.080 --> 12:43.080
Jackie poo is so full of shit

12:43.800 --> 12:47.360
Is that what you want on a shirt there? Yes, I want that actually, you know

12:47.400 --> 12:51.000
I'm gonna I've actually started working on this picture. I'm gonna go ahead and tell everybody

12:51.000 --> 13:00.240
about putting a Jack Thompson's head on a donkey and making a jackass shirt

13:00.240 --> 13:04.040
because no actually he couldn't say it was harassment because it's legal under

13:04.040 --> 13:12.200
parity I don't know all right let's go over now to dark Sakura dark Sakura

13:12.200 --> 13:17.520
likes to surf the interweb and she scones it up and down day in day out and

13:17.520 --> 13:22.720
she finds at work and she finds that one website special enough to share with you

13:22.720 --> 13:26.000
kids in a little segment we call Dark Soccer's Website of the Week, correct?

13:26.000 --> 13:36.000
Yes. Today's website of the week is Kingdom Hearts Ultimania, which is one of

13:36.000 --> 13:40.760
my absolute favorite Kingdom Hearts sites for a long, long time. Not only does

13:40.760 --> 13:44.800
this place have like stories on here, it has information about final mix, images,

13:44.800 --> 13:52.680
artwork, videos, audio, you name it, it has lyrics, translated, they have it in the kanji,

13:52.680 --> 13:58.680
romaji, english, everything. It's really, really just an excellent site. You can get

13:58.680 --> 14:07.360
there by going to www.kh2.co.uk. Very, very good site. Excellent forums, it's just really

14:07.360 --> 14:13.080
top notch as far as, it's the place to go for Kingdom Hearts information.

14:13.080 --> 14:16.580
So all those fanboys and fangirls that somebody labeled it earlier?

14:16.580 --> 14:17.580
Place for them to convene.

14:17.580 --> 14:18.580
Go convene!

14:18.580 --> 14:19.580
Talk about cosplay.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.460
Go play!

14:21.460 --> 14:24.200
Dream worlds they want to see in a future Kingdom Hearts?

14:24.200 --> 14:25.420
All that good stuff.

14:25.420 --> 14:31.400
It's really, it even has, the gallery has so much in it, you can just sit there and

14:31.400 --> 14:35.040
look at the fan art forever.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.280
They don't have Slash do they?

14:36.280 --> 14:37.280
Because that stuff is scary.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.280
The Kingdom Hearts Slash.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.840
I usually try not to look at it.

14:40.840 --> 14:45.200
I didn't play the first game, but I read a lot of Slash thanks to my friend.

14:45.200 --> 14:53.880
I've seen some very interesting yaoi doujinshi posted a while back, very interesting stuff.

14:53.880 --> 14:58.200
It was very disturbing because they're children, and I was like, why am I looking at this?

14:58.200 --> 15:00.880
You know what was better about the Slash than the first game?

15:00.880 --> 15:02.880
Had a better camera.

15:02.880 --> 15:07.400
Oh, that was a Kingdom Hearts joke, I get it.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.400
Yeah, it was.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.980
Loki speaking of trashy things

15:11.320 --> 15:17.900
Are kids able to still pick them up those trashy trashy games the evil games that Jack Thompson says we play well the Federal Trade Commission

15:19.080 --> 15:21.600
released some results with

15:22.320 --> 15:25.940
Of their actual there in nationwide undercover

15:27.340 --> 15:29.340
sting operation guests of

15:29.340 --> 15:34.700
electronic and video game stores. They were basically checking to see if people are still

15:34.700 --> 15:40.860
selling these games to minors. And well, actually they found that it's been a decrease.

15:42.380 --> 15:49.900
According to the survey here, 42% of the secret shoppers, children between the ages of 13 and 16,

15:49.900 --> 15:54.860
who attempted to buy an M-rated video game without a parent, were able to make a purchase.

15:54.860 --> 16:08.040
However, it says in 2003, the percentage was 69%, so it's actually gone down quite a bit.

16:08.040 --> 16:16.500
And it says now there's more stricter sales of M-rated games and only about 35% of Secret

16:16.500 --> 16:20.100
Shoppers were able to purchase them now, so I don't know.

16:20.100 --> 16:23.820
I bet you, you know, 35 is still kind of a high number for this stuff, you know?

16:23.820 --> 16:26.880
I just feel like we're still going to not hear the end of this.

16:26.880 --> 16:30.180
There's no actual laws in place for this in

16:30.180 --> 16:34.980
most states. There's no real laws for this so

16:34.980 --> 16:39.060
I mean it's just a recommendation. And it's all company enforced so

16:39.060 --> 16:41.900
thirty-five percent is down that's actually pretty awesome that a company

16:41.900 --> 16:43.580
can enforce their

16:43.580 --> 16:47.460
their will upon their employees to make sure they check

16:47.460 --> 16:51.540
for ID and stuff like that.

16:51.540 --> 16:55.940
Well, one thing you wonít be needing your ID to buy anytime soon might be a UMD movie

16:55.940 --> 17:00.200
because the rumor is these things are on their way out the door.

17:00.200 --> 17:05.140
Rumor is that Hollywood studios and Wal-Mart are looking to drop the format that they may

17:05.140 --> 17:07.880
not be carrying this much longer.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.380
This is very interesting.

17:10.380 --> 17:16.880
Paramount had a quote here, ìReleasing UMD format movies is the exception rather than

17:16.880 --> 17:21.520
the rule.î Universal Studios, one executive over there, was quoted saying, ìI donít

17:21.520 --> 17:24.980
Sales are near zilch. It's another Sony bomb ooh

17:26.800 --> 17:27.880
Burn

17:27.880 --> 17:32.060
Has anybody actually tried to watch a UMD movie cuz it's I did on the plane

17:32.060 --> 17:33.600
I did on a plane too. I did too

17:33.600 --> 17:37.080
I tried to watch spider-man 2 because it came with my system, and it was not fun to watch

17:37.080 --> 17:43.020
I watched Hellboy. I saw I saw Tron. Yeah. It was fine Tron looked pretty hot

17:43.020 --> 17:49.140
They have nice, those PSPs have nice screens. The problem is those movies are

17:49.140 --> 17:53.500
twenty-something dollars, in some cases more expensive than what they are on DVD

17:53.500 --> 17:58.060
and I can't play those on my DVD player. And you don't get the bonus features for the most part.

17:58.060 --> 18:03.580
That's right, that's the problem. So the format, it was a good idea at first, I

18:03.580 --> 18:08.540
think, but I think the problem is there's no, if there were players that supported

18:08.540 --> 18:12.980
UMD, hell, even if they would announce that the PlayStation 3 would support the UMDs,

18:12.980 --> 18:15.540
which, what, you just pointed, what, Loki?

18:15.540 --> 18:19.980
Actually, there, I thought that was one of the things they're going to announce at E3,

18:19.980 --> 18:25.700
is that there will be some sort of way to play UMD movies on TVs.

18:25.700 --> 18:28.780
Well, it's maybe too late.

18:28.780 --> 18:29.780
I think it's stupid.

18:29.780 --> 18:34.700
I mean, okay, good, you can play a UMD movie on TV, okay, why do I have to buy a UMD movie

18:34.700 --> 18:37.020
over a DVD then?

18:37.020 --> 18:38.020
That's right.

18:38.020 --> 18:39.780
There is no reason.

18:39.780 --> 18:43.380
So goodbye UMDs, we hardly knew ya.

18:43.380 --> 18:46.780
And that makes me sad and a little bit angry at times.

18:46.780 --> 18:50.860
So I think it's time we get a little bit angsty here on Orange Lounge Radio.

18:50.860 --> 18:53.620
Dark Sakura, do you agree?

18:53.620 --> 18:54.620
On occasion.

18:54.620 --> 19:16.500
My F.U. of the week would have to go toward Mt. Mike's Pizza.

19:16.500 --> 19:22.380
It was very nice of my boss to buy our team pizza and she was very thoughtful to get vegetarian

19:22.380 --> 19:28.220
pizza. Except that I reacted to this vegetarian pizza the way that I react to meat. My stomach

19:28.220 --> 19:33.700
hurt like I had been doing a bajillion crunches. And yet I felt very full. I felt this way

19:33.700 --> 19:40.700
until yesterday morning. So a big F.U. goes to notlikespizza for trying to play for me.

19:41.940 --> 19:48.220
Loki! My F.U. goes to Best Buy and the stupid person that they have working in their camera

19:48.220 --> 19:53.460
department in their site store guy wasn't needed asking questions I was

19:53.460 --> 19:57.300
buying a video camera yesterday and I asked them okay what's the difference

19:57.300 --> 20:01.020
between this camera and this other camera that was newer okay well that

20:01.020 --> 20:04.500
didn't tell me anything you dumbass I could tell that by looking at it so

20:04.500 --> 20:09.420
completely useless however I did find a camera after having to drive a half an

20:09.420 --> 20:16.980
hour to the Elk Grove store so that sucked that stupid drivers my f-u goes

20:16.980 --> 20:21.060
to male PMS because I think I've had that all weekend. I know you can't tell during

20:21.060 --> 20:26.600
the show because I'm my peppy self, but I've had male PMS. It sucks. Not that I'm not having

20:26.600 --> 20:30.760
woman issues, but you know that whole study that shows that men get that chemical imbalance

20:30.760 --> 20:36.340
that makes them all moody too once every so often? I think I have that this weekend, so

20:36.340 --> 20:42.680
Be careful around me, I'm in my brain, in my head, yes.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.240
The area bet- nevermind, I'm not gonna go there.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.140
The other area's just fine.

20:47.140 --> 20:50.900
It's my brain.

20:50.900 --> 20:56.460
As many people throw their iPods out the car window in horror at that thought, uh, eh,

20:56.460 --> 20:57.460
they won't be missed.

20:57.460 --> 20:58.460
I mean, shut up.

20:58.460 --> 21:01.340
Miklataav, do you have an F.U. of the week you'd like to go?

21:01.340 --> 21:02.340
Yeah, of course.

21:02.340 --> 21:08.100
like Loki, my F.U. goes to the best buy, Citrus Heights, for treating me like a

21:08.100 --> 21:12.340
criminal, for wanting to take back my 360 today because I had issues with it. And

21:12.340 --> 21:16.860
when we were walking my new one over to the counter so they could kind of fake

21:16.860 --> 21:21.300
bring me up to swap it out, the guy from media was like, there's another person

21:21.300 --> 21:25.500
taking back their 360? Do they not know how to work it or something? I wanted to

21:25.500 --> 21:29.780
punch him. And preemptive F.U. to Microsoft because I have a feeling this

21:29.780 --> 21:33.360
one will be broken too. Then I'm going to give an F.U. to the Best

21:33.360 --> 21:38.360
Buy at Citrus Heights too for giving me PMS. Somehow. I walk too close to a television

21:38.360 --> 21:43.640
or something and suddenly bam. And I say F.U. to my jeans for my chromosome

21:43.640 --> 21:47.160
patterns for giving me PMS. On the fact that I'm female.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.040
I thought you meant like the jeans you're wearing.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.320
No, the jeans that I'm wearing are actually quite comfortable.

21:51.320 --> 21:55.160
They do not deserve an F.U. DJ Pooeater is so a winner in the chatroom.

21:55.160 --> 21:59.400
He says, I get PMS every month. He's a man, he's a mini. I get PMS every month. It's the

21:59.400 --> 22:03.360
It's a day after my wife's PMS.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.360
That's a joke.

22:04.360 --> 22:05.360
Get it?

22:05.360 --> 22:06.360
Ha.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.360
Ha.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.360
Ha.

22:08.360 --> 22:09.360
Ha.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.360
I laughed.

22:10.360 --> 22:13.000
Wouldn't it be the same day because she's bugging him?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.800
No, but like he's so exhausted after helping her.

22:16.800 --> 22:17.800
Ohhh.

22:17.800 --> 22:18.800
Forget it.

22:18.800 --> 22:19.800
Forget it.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.800
Men have no idea what PMS is like.

22:21.800 --> 22:22.800
I don't know.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.240
You have no way of knowing what PMS is like.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.240
I don't know.

22:26.240 --> 22:29.140
The day that you grow a uterus and it decides to...

22:29.140 --> 22:34.060
With the exception of the, you know, the birds and bees part that you learned about in fourth

22:34.060 --> 22:37.660
grade and the biological element of it all, I don't know.

22:37.660 --> 22:42.260
Some days I get pretty grumpy and irritable.

22:42.260 --> 22:45.980
Okay, I do know that...

22:45.980 --> 22:46.980
Ask my loved ones.

22:46.980 --> 22:48.300
And I crave junk food too.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.780
I go through the whole motions.

22:49.780 --> 22:52.860
It's short of the physical aspect of...

22:52.860 --> 22:53.860
PMS.

22:53.860 --> 22:54.860
That.

22:54.860 --> 22:56.860
Anyway, sorry.

22:56.860 --> 23:01.860
Loki, please bring this back to games.

23:01.860 --> 23:03.860
Okay.

23:03.860 --> 23:10.860
Well, there's actually been a recall on the Pelican Power Brick battery charger.

23:10.860 --> 23:16.860
It's basically this giant brick that you attach to your PSP that gives it more battery life.

23:16.860 --> 23:23.860
Unfortunately, there's a little problem with it being that, well, it overheats and it's actually caused fire damage.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.820
damage.

23:25.820 --> 23:27.780
According to the website...

23:27.780 --> 23:32.620
Who would have thought that something called the power brick might be dangerous?

23:32.620 --> 23:40.900
According to the website, powerbrickrecall.net, there has actually been 143 reports of the

23:40.900 --> 23:45.460
recalled battery charger overheating, including one report of fire damage.

23:45.460 --> 23:48.100
No injuries have been reported.

23:48.100 --> 23:54.860
Also that, you know, so basically what you need to do, and they give you some information

23:54.860 --> 24:00.580
of hotlines to call, you need to send it back, um, I don't know, there's better batteries

24:00.580 --> 24:09.240
out there to be honest, so, I don't know, anyways, yeah, so don't buy these battery

24:09.240 --> 24:13.700
accessories, you know, for your PSP, because to be honest, it lasts long enough as it is.

24:13.700 --> 24:18.200
Alright, so I was checking out GameTap this week and I noticed that they added a lot of

24:18.200 --> 24:22.080
new features to GameTap because, well, I'd heard on the internet these rumors that they

24:22.080 --> 24:26.100
were going to be adding new things, so I decided to check it out over at GameTap and it's kind

24:26.100 --> 24:29.720
of neat because now they have all these video on demand things and do you remember when

24:29.720 --> 24:33.420
we were interviewing that guy from GameTap here on the show a few weeks ago?

24:33.420 --> 24:34.420
Yeah.

24:34.420 --> 24:37.520
He kind of hinted at some of this, I think, because we asked him about if GameTap was

24:37.520 --> 24:41.120
going to be like a television network and I think he had these bigger and better ideas

24:41.120 --> 24:43.940
you're kind of seeing this stuff in motion now is that you can get the

24:43.940 --> 24:47.600
videos on demand yet the music video on demand and some of their shows which

24:47.600 --> 24:50.480
might I say are actually better than a lot of the shows I've seen on g4 in the

24:50.480 --> 24:54.020
past you know six months you mean Star Trek and bonds I know like think no

24:54.020 --> 24:58.260
things actually relating to games and presented by people that seem to actually

24:58.260 --> 25:03.800
enjoy games it's something unreal there so um game tap by the way is also added

25:03.800 --> 25:08.740
I guess neo geo stuff now because I checked out baseball stars and then they

25:08.740 --> 25:12.740
They also have Darkstalkers, so that means Capcom's on their way in too.

25:12.740 --> 25:16.000
And I heard some rumor they're doing a big Street Fighter thing, so I just thought I'd

25:16.000 --> 25:17.680
drop that out there.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.380
But what's interesting, oh, they also lowered their price.

25:19.380 --> 25:21.440
GameTap's now only, I think, $9.95 a month.

25:21.440 --> 25:24.580
And I hate to sound like a marketing thing, because really, you know, GameTap has its

25:24.580 --> 25:25.580
issues.

25:25.580 --> 25:26.580
They still need multiplayer.

25:26.580 --> 25:28.380
That would really help them sell their things.

25:28.380 --> 25:33.140
But I do think it's a really just neat concept idea, and I hope it's successful.

25:33.140 --> 25:36.160
But a lot of people are saying it's doom and gloom, because, oh, price cut means they've

25:36.160 --> 25:37.200
got to move things.

25:37.200 --> 25:41.400
and not necessarily it could be just an incentive to get more people on you know

25:41.400 --> 25:46.560
maybe $15 is a little too high people might go for 10 we'll see all right

25:46.560 --> 25:51.680
Loki one game you can play on game tap is Tomb Raider but the old ones but

25:51.680 --> 25:54.760
there's a new one coming right yeah well Tomb Raider legend right now is coming

25:54.760 --> 26:02.440
out on PlayStation 2 Xbox Xbox 360 and PSP in May now the only thing it isn't

26:02.440 --> 26:09.440
isn't coming out on is, you know, the Nintendo systems. No GameCube, no Nintendo DS. However,

26:10.680 --> 26:16.600
it's possibly coming out later this year for them. And apparently, once again from IGN,

26:16.600 --> 26:23.600
they have talked to Eidos and apparently Bill Gardner, the Eidos North America CEO and President,

26:23.600 --> 26:27.620
the IDOS North America CEO and President

26:27.620 --> 26:30.640
basically said Laura likes Reggie, you know

26:30.640 --> 26:34.420
referring to Reggie over at

26:34.420 --> 26:38.220
the Nintendo of America and basically

26:38.220 --> 26:41.900
you know they're talking about it being

26:41.900 --> 26:46.780
released later on possibly I don't know probably the end of the summer would be my guess

26:46.780 --> 26:52.820
now the only thing though this was announced kind of around April Fools

26:52.820 --> 26:58.140
so we don't know. Personally, I don't think it's gonna, because the GameCube is not really

26:58.140 --> 27:03.420
a big system right now as far as releases go. There's like maybe two a month, and the

27:03.420 --> 27:08.380
DS, well, you know, it's pretty good, but I don't see you being able to port this very

27:08.380 --> 27:13.300
well over the DS, so I'm gonna call bullshit on this story to be honest. I don't think

27:13.300 --> 27:19.420
it's coming out on the GameCube or any Nintendo system any time soon. Oh, that's my thought.

27:19.420 --> 27:22.140
We'll see.

27:22.140 --> 27:25.580
That's the problem with April Fool's Day, you don't know what to believe, but the Game

27:25.580 --> 27:30.580
Cube, maybe the fact that a lot of people still own one and there isn't a lot of games

27:30.580 --> 27:34.260
coming out for it is an incentive to put this game out on Game Cube, I don't know.

27:34.260 --> 27:36.340
I think it'd be a waste of money.

27:36.340 --> 27:39.860
Alright, well of course we all know one of the incentives to getting a revolution is

27:39.860 --> 27:44.520
going to be the backwards compatibility with not only Nintendo products, but Sega and Turbo

27:44.520 --> 27:49.060
Graphics as well, and we think we might know some of the games coming, possibly?

27:49.060 --> 27:53.220
Well there was a wish list that was posted.

27:53.220 --> 27:58.020
Game Daily had an article up where they put up a wish list of games.

27:58.020 --> 28:01.240
And these were some of the ones that made the list, which are actually all games that

28:01.240 --> 28:06.320
I own except for one, which is the last one on the list.

28:06.320 --> 28:12.120
But the big thing about this is that there are some really good games listed on here.

28:12.120 --> 28:17.020
Now it was posted on April 1st, so I am a little bit leery, but I'll go ahead and read

28:17.020 --> 28:18.020
it off.

28:18.020 --> 28:22.820
Gates of Thunder, Lords of Thunder, Blazing Lasers, Neutopia, Neutopia 2,

28:22.820 --> 28:28.820
Ys I and II, Ys III, Wanderers from Ys, Devil's Crush, Alien Crush,

28:28.820 --> 28:33.860
Keith Courage and the Alpha Zones, Why? Dear God, Why? Ninja Spirit,

28:33.860 --> 28:38.860
Keith Courage was not that great, Bonk's Adventure, Bonk's Revenge, Dracula X,

28:38.860 --> 28:44.860
Rondo of Blood, ah, sexy game, Splatterhouse, and Air Zonk, which of those

28:44.860 --> 28:46.700
those are the ones I do not own as Arizona.

28:46.700 --> 28:48.180
All right.

28:48.180 --> 28:50.820
Okay, so what we have to do now to follow that up

28:50.820 --> 28:52.860
is we have to make a wish list of our own.

28:52.860 --> 28:55.340
And you know there's only one way we can do that, right?

28:55.340 --> 28:57.060
Right, now are we going to be including

28:57.060 --> 28:59.020
the games that were already on this list

28:59.020 --> 28:59.860
if we'd really like to see them?

28:59.860 --> 29:01.700
I think so because those are,

29:01.700 --> 29:03.940
I mean, those are all the really good turbo graphics ones.

29:03.940 --> 29:05.700
I think we need to let those on the list.

29:05.700 --> 29:06.900
Because I have one I want to use.

29:06.900 --> 29:08.900
So anyway, the way we do it around here,

29:08.900 --> 29:09.820
if you've never heard it before,

29:09.820 --> 29:11.940
the way we make lists is through a little segment

29:11.940 --> 29:12.940
We call...

29:12.940 --> 29:13.940
Listless!

29:13.940 --> 29:19.480
Cue the game show music, because that's what it's like, one big game show.

29:19.480 --> 29:23.980
Here's how Listless works, those of you folks listening live right now on orangelaunchdata.com

29:23.980 --> 29:26.820
Sunday night, you have the chance to interact with this segment, you're going to help us

29:26.820 --> 29:30.740
build the definitive list, tonight's topic.

29:30.740 --> 29:37.940
Games we most want to see from Sega and NEC on the Nintendo revolution, besides Sonic,

29:37.940 --> 29:40.660
because we all know Sonic would happen.

29:40.660 --> 29:41.660
That's a given.

29:41.660 --> 29:44.780
We got to think outside the box so games we most want to see on the revolution besides

29:44.780 --> 29:47.260
Sonic from Sega and NEC.

29:47.260 --> 29:51.380
So the way it works you guys, we're going to go around and give our top 3, myself, Loki

29:51.380 --> 29:54.300
Dark Soccer and our guest Miklotov, we'll give our top 3.

29:54.300 --> 29:59.020
Then the fun part comes, we take one off of the list, each of us, and then you guys, the

29:59.020 --> 30:03.940
chat room, get the final say, you get two votes, a number 1 and a number 2 in what you

30:03.940 --> 30:06.620
think should be on the wish list.

30:06.620 --> 30:11.620
And maybe we'll send this wish list to Nintendo and Sega and NEC somehow.

30:11.620 --> 30:14.800
We'll look in our little black book and see if we have some addresses we can send this

30:14.800 --> 30:15.800
to.

30:15.800 --> 30:16.800
Alright!

30:16.800 --> 30:17.800
So, here we go.

30:17.800 --> 30:18.800
Who wants to start us off tonight?

30:18.800 --> 30:20.800
Dark Soccer, you want to start us off?

30:20.800 --> 30:21.800
Sure.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.720
Alright, what is your number 3 pick for Sega or any C game you most want?

30:24.720 --> 30:25.720
I am making a disclaimer.

30:25.720 --> 30:26.720
Okay.

30:26.720 --> 30:29.800
Two of the games I would really like to see on there I'm not going to list because nobody's

30:29.800 --> 30:30.800
heard of them.

30:30.800 --> 30:31.800
Like Emerald Dragon and Sapphire.

30:31.800 --> 30:32.800
Gotcha.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.800
But I suggest people give them a try if they can.

30:35.800 --> 30:36.800
Okay.

30:36.800 --> 30:40.320
So my number 3 is Star Parodia, which also probably only a handful of people have heard

30:40.320 --> 30:41.320
of.

30:41.320 --> 30:59.320
It's a shooting game featuring a flying Bomberman, a flying PC Engine, and a Super Deformed Viper.

30:59.320 --> 31:04.320
So it was this cute little game, like if you play as the PC Engine, which I always did,

31:04.320 --> 31:09.320
you could shoot out CDs and cue cards as your firepower. It was really cute.

31:09.320 --> 31:10.320
Alright, very cool.

31:10.320 --> 31:11.320
Loki, what's your number 3?

31:11.320 --> 31:13.320
My number 3...

31:13.320 --> 31:15.320
I would have to say...

31:15.320 --> 31:17.320
Splatterhouse.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.320
That game's fun.

31:19.320 --> 31:22.320
You gotta love a game that kind of mocks Friday the 13th

31:22.320 --> 31:25.320
and has a guy that's main weapon is a 2x4.

31:26.320 --> 31:28.320
Mikletov, your number 3 pick.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.320
Um, I have a disclaimer too.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.320
All my games are really random.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.320
Okay.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.320
So my number 3 would be Panic,

31:35.320 --> 31:38.320
because that game was awesome and very scary when I was little.

31:38.320 --> 31:44.140
on the Sega CD oh my god I first thought I'd never heard of this game and oh my

31:44.140 --> 31:48.440
god I have heard of panic that little kid and push buttons and things and you

31:48.440 --> 31:53.440
go to another room taking places and it's scary but I loved it okay sounds

31:53.440 --> 31:57.120
good my number three pick would have been a splatter house was actually my

31:57.120 --> 32:00.840
number three so I'm gonna have to choose something else I would say devil's crush

32:00.840 --> 32:03.800
I think it's gonna be a number my number three pick because it was a badass

32:03.800 --> 32:07.120
pinball game so I'm gonna go with the devil's crush for sure

32:07.120 --> 32:10.760
Alright, DarkSakura, what's your number two pick?

32:10.760 --> 32:15.240
My number two pick was a game that was on Sega CD as well, Popful Mail.

32:15.240 --> 32:19.000
Actually, Working Designs brought it out in the US.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
Really fun, cute little translation. Very, very hard to get your hands on a copy of

32:24.000 --> 32:24.600
this now.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.760
But it's a little side-scrolling adventure RPG.

32:27.760 --> 32:31.080
Now I've never heard of this game, I have to admit. Did I spell it right there?

32:31.080 --> 32:35.320
Popful? P-O-P-F-U-L and then mail as in

32:35.320 --> 32:43.320
It was such a cute little game. I'll bring over my Sega CD one day so you can see this game.

32:43.320 --> 32:47.320
It was one of the Working Designs projects back in the day.

32:47.320 --> 32:51.320
You know the types of games that Working Designs brought us.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.320
Loki, you're number two.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.320
Um, my number two.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.320
No, it was kind of a fun game.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.320
Oh, Shadow Dancer.

33:01.320 --> 33:03.320
Mm.

33:03.320 --> 33:05.320
One of the best Shinobi games.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.320
Shadow Dancer was excellent.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.320
Oh, okay. All right.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.320
Miklotov, your number two pick.

33:11.320 --> 33:12.320
Moonwalker.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.320
Moonwalker! I knew somebody had to say that.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.320
Um, because that game was super cool.

33:18.320 --> 33:20.320
Smooth criminal.

33:20.320 --> 33:25.940
your hat. Uh, my number two would be one of the greatest and most overlooked Sega CD games

33:25.940 --> 33:29.540
of all time. And remember that this is, you know, and we don't even know if Sega CD games

33:29.540 --> 33:33.300
are gonna end up on Nintendo Revolution, but just the whole idea of seeing this on the

33:33.300 --> 33:40.100
revolution would make me giggle in places I didn't even know I had. Night Trap is my

33:40.100 --> 33:45.100
number two pick. I had What's Her Face in it. With Dana Plato. Yeah. Who? She's dead

33:45.100 --> 33:51.880
Can you just imagine Nitra on a different strokes on the on the Nintendo revolution come on?

33:52.100 --> 33:57.340
How ironic would that be all right number one picks guys Dark Sakura start us off

33:57.340 --> 34:02.260
What is your number one pick for Sega or NEC game you want the Dracula X Rondo of blood?

34:03.220 --> 34:05.940
most sexy Castlevania game in existence

34:07.340 --> 34:09.600
All right, I'm so glad that my friend owed me money

34:09.600 --> 34:23.600
Is that how you got it? Yeah, one of my friends who's done some translation work for us. She was in our room at AX a few years ago. She owed us $100. She came back from Japan with Dracula X.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.600
Nice exchange. I say so.

34:26.600 --> 34:34.600
Loki, your number one pick. You know what I really don't know why they haven't done a next gen version of this yet? Road Rash.

34:34.600 --> 34:38.960
They did do a Road Rash. Yeah, but not next-gen.

34:38.960 --> 34:42.960
There hasn't been anything since, like, uh... There was one on PlayStation.

34:42.960 --> 34:47.640
Yeah, the original PlayStation, maybe... There was one on the 3DO.

34:47.640 --> 34:52.520
I remember the 3DO one. Alright, what was Road Rash all about? I remember the name, but I remember the game.

34:52.520 --> 34:57.080
Road Rash is basically motorcycle racing and combat. So you're, you know, riding

34:57.080 --> 35:00.080
motorcycles and hitting people with chains and baseball bats and stuff.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.440
Oh! I've seen the Final Fantasy VII. Okay, I have played that game before.

35:03.440 --> 35:07.320
Alright, sounds good. Let's see, our chat room says

35:07.320 --> 35:12.200
GK128 says Road Rash was E3, but there was one on PS2 that was canned.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.320
So I guess they started to do one and didn't.

35:15.320 --> 35:19.520
Miklotov, your number one pick. This is a game nobody will know,

35:19.520 --> 35:22.600
so it should get kicked off right away. It's called Zoom.

35:22.600 --> 35:27.720
It's on the Genesis, you know that? I know Zoom. That game is so awesome. Isn't that a puzzle game?

35:27.720 --> 35:32.720
Yes! That game sucked! No, that game was sweet! That game was awful! It was an MTV game, wasn't it?

35:32.720 --> 35:38.180
What? Yes, I think it was. No, you're thinking zoop. Oh, I am thinking of zoop. Okay. This is also a puzzle game

35:38.780 --> 35:45.360
Okay, you're like this pig head thing with legs and you drew squares and you had to watch out for the scrubbing bubbles things

35:45.600 --> 35:47.600
Okay, that's kind of cool. You're out

35:48.880 --> 35:54.480
You're thinking that game was awful. No, this is like, okay, really old first generation Genesis game

35:54.480 --> 35:56.480
All right, so I get I get the last say

35:57.060 --> 36:00.380
Number one pick. I was really tempted to do toe jam and Earl

36:00.380 --> 36:05.120
I'm sorry Chad because I like chat room is yelling out to a general but I have to do this for the simple irony if

36:05.120 --> 36:07.280
You were a kid when this whole

36:08.240 --> 36:11.220
Thing went down you would know why I have to say

36:11.600 --> 36:15.880
Mortal Kombat the Genesis version has to be on the Nintendo revolution

36:15.880 --> 36:23.060
So Nintendo finally gets some Mortal Kombat with blood in it and not sweat and really small characters. Yes

36:23.900 --> 36:27.480
there actually was a blood kid for this SNES one that changed the

36:27.480 --> 36:32.080
You had to have the game genie, right? So it was basically a hex crack thing.

36:32.080 --> 36:36.420
No, it's not the same. So I want to see Mortal Kombat in full blood glory

36:36.420 --> 36:41.800
on the revolution. I do have to say that DJ Pooh Eater labeled a game that I'd have to

36:41.800 --> 36:42.560
make a

36:42.560 --> 36:47.040
a modification to. This would be like my number five, I think. Alice Kidd in Shinobi World

36:47.040 --> 36:50.760
from the Master System. Oh, that's a good one.

36:50.760 --> 36:53.840
Or Wonder Boy in Monsterland. Alright,

36:53.840 --> 36:55.840
Here's the list as it stands right now.

36:55.840 --> 37:00.280
Star Parodia, Splatterhouse, Panic, Devil's Crush,

37:00.280 --> 37:04.280
Popful Mail, Shadow Dancer, Moonwalker, Night Trap,

37:04.280 --> 37:07.200
Dracula X, Rondo of Blood, Road Rash,

37:07.200 --> 37:09.560
Zoom, and Mortal Kombat.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.560
Boy, this was way more random than I thought it would be.

37:12.560 --> 37:13.760
We're weird.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.600
All right, but here it is.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.520
Here's the part to get rid of the most weird stuff.

37:17.520 --> 37:20.760
We eliminate one pick before we let the chat room vote.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.600
So Dark Sakura, what's coming off the list?

37:23.600 --> 37:24.720
Um, Night Trap.

37:25.180 --> 37:26.620
Aww, you're no fun.

37:26.620 --> 37:30.940
Cuz, Dan and I tried to play through that game, and it was so stupid.

37:31.240 --> 37:35.700
But it's Slumber Parties, and Dana Plato, and Zombies!

37:36.020 --> 37:40.360
You know, if I wanted to watch Stupid, I could watch, like, the Toxic Avenger movies.

37:41.480 --> 37:42.900
Loki, what's coming off this list?

37:42.900 --> 37:45.900
You know, I should've put Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

37:45.900 --> 37:47.100
Zombies Ate My Neighbors was cool.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.380
But that was on Super Nintendo too, wasn't it?

37:48.380 --> 37:49.500
Yeah, so that's why we can't.

37:49.500 --> 37:50.000
There's a chance.

37:50.000 --> 37:50.500
There's a chance.

37:50.500 --> 37:53.500
Um, Zoom, I've never heard of that game.

37:53.500 --> 37:56.500
Aww, such a great game.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.500
Alright, Miek Latov, what's coming off the list?

37:58.500 --> 38:01.500
Um, just because I think my company likes to be evil,

38:01.500 --> 38:03.500
Dracula X is gone.

38:03.500 --> 38:05.500
Oh!

38:05.500 --> 38:08.500
I don't think Konami would let that happen,

38:08.500 --> 38:10.500
because we're jerks.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.500
Alright, wow.

38:12.500 --> 38:15.500
That's, I think that would have won.

38:15.500 --> 38:16.500
That would have won, too.

38:16.500 --> 38:17.500
I can't believe I didn't say Bomberman, either.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.500
No, yeah, nobody said Bomberman

38:19.740 --> 38:26.200
Stupids he's had Bomberman on Super Nintendo. Oh, that's true. But it was completely different on Genesis though. That's true. All right

38:26.580 --> 38:31.180
64 is pretty fun. See you see Jamie. I won't take it off. I want to okay. Matt didn't have one taken off

38:31.180 --> 38:33.180
So I'm gonna be fair. I'm gonna take off

38:34.820 --> 38:36.820
Mmm, I don't know

38:40.980 --> 38:42.980
I'm gonna take I

38:42.980 --> 38:47.060
Actually kind of like his picks. Well, I'm gonna take off road rash because it's too much of a gray area

38:47.540 --> 38:52.900
Because like, you know, they're kind of was an x-gen one. So but not really so and plus I didn't really

38:53.820 --> 38:56.940
That's the same thing that Final Fantasy says it's a kitchen

39:00.380 --> 39:04.980
All right, here it is you guys can vote for your favorites in chat room right now star Parodia

39:05.660 --> 39:08.460
Splatterhouse panic devil's crush

39:08.460 --> 39:15.660
Potful Mail, Shadow Dancer, Moonwalker, and Mortal Kombat. So send a private

39:15.660 --> 39:20.100
message to Sky in the chat room with your number one and your number two picks

39:20.100 --> 39:25.140
and we'll let you know at the end of the show who the winners are. And boy did

39:25.140 --> 39:29.100
we end up weird. That was a really weird list. I sort of wish that now that I put Emerald

39:29.100 --> 39:32.340
Dragon on there because Emerald Dragon was such a good game. I wish that they

39:32.340 --> 39:36.680
would say let's bring Saturn games on because then I could say you know

39:36.680 --> 39:40.160
freaking black matrix cuz that game would never that game will never come

39:40.160 --> 39:43.440
out over here I think though even though our list is really random I think that's

39:43.440 --> 39:46.000
a good thing because we're thinking of titles that a lot of people sometimes

39:46.000 --> 39:48.440
don't think of right away when they think of Sega Genesis me everybody

39:48.440 --> 39:51.800
thinks of Sonic but you know I think this is good but there's there's also

39:51.800 --> 39:56.440
those some pretty you know they were pretty mainstream games on there cuz

39:56.440 --> 40:03.960
devil's crush and shadow dancer those were really popular I remember just

40:03.960 --> 40:07.100
sitting in the same room watching Dan play through Shadow Dancer and I was

40:07.100 --> 40:10.140
like yeah this game is awesome because you have a dog yeah that's why I

40:10.140 --> 40:15.840
couldn't take it off the list it's too good all right Dark Sakura is the

40:15.840 --> 40:20.300

Well I guess I think this is saccharina, I think but didn't sign it about

40:58.060 --> 41:07.340
First of all, I'll just go ahead and read the email.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.860
First things first, I played Supernova.

41:08.860 --> 41:09.860
It was awesome.

41:09.860 --> 41:10.860
I really enjoyed it.

41:10.860 --> 41:12.940
The left pad was kind of sticky, but the music was awesome.

41:12.940 --> 41:20.780
I highly recommend Seduction Vocal Mix, but yes, it was really awesome and it looked nice.

41:20.780 --> 41:24.860
The next one is from the other Jamie, who spells the name differently.

41:24.860 --> 41:29.620
Remember the fun last year with the Mega Man Effect, though it only could run on a Mac?

41:29.620 --> 41:31.620
They ported it.

41:31.620 --> 41:34.740
Oh, the Mega Man Effect thing, I remember that.

41:34.740 --> 41:36.480
What's that?

41:36.480 --> 41:37.480
When you would boot up a...

41:37.480 --> 41:39.820
Check out the MySpace, there's a clip from the show on there.

41:39.820 --> 41:40.820
MySpace slash...

41:40.820 --> 41:41.820
MySpace.com slash...

41:41.820 --> 41:42.820
I don't have time for MySpace.

41:42.820 --> 41:43.820
Too bad.

41:43.820 --> 41:45.820
There it is, that's all I'm giving you.

41:45.820 --> 41:46.820
Jerk.

41:46.820 --> 41:54.220
Um, our dear friend Rob with two Bs sent us an email about Sega Sammy.

41:54.220 --> 41:58.220
I would also like to say Rob with 2 B's has a higher gamer score than anybody on my Xbox

41:58.220 --> 41:59.220
friends list.

41:59.220 --> 42:00.220
Congratulations my friend.

42:00.220 --> 42:04.940
Just to go, he actually posted a bit of an article in here about Sega debuting a new

42:04.940 --> 42:05.940
headquarters.

42:05.940 --> 42:11.820
Sega Amusements, the US game factory that has emerged from the merger of Japanese game

42:11.820 --> 42:17.260
giant Sega Corp and the equally powerful Sammy Corporation have held a grand opening recently

42:17.260 --> 42:23.100
for their new 77,000 square foot sales development and game and prize warehouse facility in the

42:23.100 --> 42:27.820
Chicago suburb of Elk Grove Village. Special guests at the event included

42:27.820 --> 42:34.100
Sega Sami holding CEO Hajime Satomi who engineered the merger and oversee I'm

42:34.100 --> 42:38.120
sorry and oversees the combined companies in Japan as well as local

42:38.120 --> 42:41.940
dignitaries such as Mayor Craig Johnson. The combination has dramatically

42:41.940 --> 42:46.180
enhanced the company's capabilities said Satomi through an interpreter. Take a

42:46.180 --> 42:49.780
look around at what we have to offer and then think about what Sega can do in the

42:49.780 --> 42:58.540
future so it's more Sega what can I say hopefully we'll see you some good things

42:58.540 --> 43:04.780
come out of them I want to see more freaking planet Harrier now we also um

43:04.780 --> 43:14.340
got an email from someone whose gamertag is L driver but IIE awesome like kill

43:14.340 --> 43:18.520
bill yeah love it so I'm gonna go ahead and read this email out I found out

43:18.520 --> 43:21.280
about your site slash show about three weeks ago and I've been listening ever

43:21.280 --> 43:24.800
since. You put out great content that's not only really funny and informative

43:24.800 --> 43:28.520
but also socially responsible and different in relation to gaming. Not to

43:28.520 --> 43:31.640
plug another podcast but gamertag radio is also another place I hear similar

43:31.640 --> 43:35.440
topics. As a 20-something working professional adult gay gamer or gamer

43:35.440 --> 43:40.800
myself I was really appreciative to the segments in your past two shows about

43:40.800 --> 43:45.040
how not all gamers are straight nerdy teenage boys. You guys also happen to be

43:45.040 --> 43:49.080
darkly sarcastic about almost everything like me, so I find myself laughing out loud while

43:49.080 --> 43:56.580
listening to your show in places like my subway ride to work or at my desk.

43:56.580 --> 43:59.800
I do have one quick question for you three, who or what do you think will steal a show

43:59.800 --> 44:00.800
at E3?

44:00.800 --> 44:04.460
I personally think PS3 is becoming overhyped, especially in the past few weeks and that

44:04.460 --> 44:07.600
Microsoft and or Nintendo will use E3 to surprise everyone.

44:07.600 --> 44:08.600
What are your thoughts?

44:08.600 --> 44:10.440
Thanks for putting out great shows and keep up the great work.

44:10.440 --> 44:13.960
I actually got to see the videos from the Game Developers Conference, including all

44:13.960 --> 44:19.760
the wonderful PS3 in-game shots. Ooh, does it look nice? I think the revolution will

44:19.760 --> 44:21.420
be awesome.

44:21.420 --> 44:25.660
I think it's going to be information overload this year. I think E3 is going to be so monumental

44:25.660 --> 44:28.840
in a way you've never imagined. I don't think any one person can steal the show. I think

44:28.840 --> 44:33.360
everybody is going to be constantly one-upping each other the whole day. I think if anybody,

44:33.360 --> 44:38.900
I think Nintendo's got the biggest secret out there, and they have, they stand to either

44:38.900 --> 44:44.300
really... Nintendo stands to either really wow us all

44:44.300 --> 44:47.980
or really disappoint the shit out of us all so it could go either way

44:47.980 --> 44:50.980
for me I but I think if anybody Nintendo's got the surprise

44:50.980 --> 44:54.320
but I'm trying not to be a Nintendo fanboy but I think they've set

44:54.320 --> 44:57.860
themselves up to either really really please or really really disappoint

44:57.860 --> 45:01.220
this is actually my first launch E3

45:01.220 --> 45:04.300
I don't count last year as a launch E3 because

45:04.300 --> 45:08.140
really it was just the oh we're doing this we're doing this

45:08.140 --> 45:14.380
DS launch one. I still don't consider that. A launch one is when we have like the major systems

45:14.380 --> 45:20.140
coming out not just like a handheld and Dan was telling me about when um the Xbox was launching

45:20.140 --> 45:25.740
and when everything else is coming out and I'm just like this year is going to be so humongous

45:25.740 --> 45:30.060
on all fronts though I really do think Nintendo is going to steal the show in the end. I think

45:30.060 --> 45:34.300
they've got something that they're not talking about that they're just going to go boom and we're

45:34.300 --> 45:39.180
gonna see it kind of like they did with the DS like yeah that was a fun show

45:39.180 --> 45:43.380
that was a fun one I still have my t-shirt so do I hey with the big brick

45:43.380 --> 45:47.920
EDS I find it very hilarious that my t-shirt fit me when I got it and now

45:47.920 --> 45:56.300
it's pajamas all right I was able to pull up mmm that um program oh the

45:56.300 --> 46:02.180
Mega Man thing it's it's pretty funny I mean oh yeah that's great Firefox do do

46:02.180 --> 46:03.180
do you do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

46:03.180 --> 46:04.180
Do do do do do do do do.

46:04.180 --> 46:05.180
Cute.

46:05.180 --> 46:06.180
Oh yeah.

46:06.180 --> 46:07.180
Very cute.

46:07.180 --> 46:09.620
Yeah you better take that off the computer before Xtravr tries to go play World of Warcraft

46:09.620 --> 46:11.160
because he's going to go, what the fuck.

46:11.160 --> 46:15.740
Too bad you can't do the little trick where you turn the stars into chickens.

46:15.740 --> 46:17.820
Who remembers that?

46:17.820 --> 46:19.000
I do, I do.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
That'd be a cool hack.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
All right any more email?

46:21.000 --> 46:25.940
Yes, there is more email, so, huh.

46:25.940 --> 46:30.720
One of our listeners, Justin, has a question for us and I'll read his letter.

46:30.720 --> 46:34.080
I noticed that Lemmings was out for the PSP, but only in the UK.

46:34.080 --> 46:37.920
I was wondering if the UK version will play on my US PSP, and if so, what is the best

46:37.920 --> 46:38.920
way to import this game?

46:38.920 --> 46:40.880
Keep up the good work on the live show.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.120
Is PSP region free?

46:42.120 --> 46:43.120
I don't remember.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.120
Yeah, PSP is region free.

46:44.120 --> 46:45.120
There you go.

46:45.120 --> 46:46.120
Import away.

46:46.120 --> 46:47.280
Find whatever.

46:47.280 --> 46:50.960
Make sure you check the Better Business Bureau before picking an importer.

46:50.960 --> 46:51.960
Trust me.

46:51.960 --> 46:56.040
And there's not, I haven't seen a lot dealing with games from Europe.

46:56.040 --> 46:57.600
You would have to order from Amazon or something.

46:57.600 --> 47:00.720
I know of a place but you don't like plugging places, do you?

47:00.720 --> 47:03.880
Why not? Go ahead. NCSX actually, uh, imported

47:03.880 --> 47:08.120
Well, yeah. NCSX is awesome. They were getting some of the, I knew that before they were getting

47:08.120 --> 47:12.880
the Europe only Dreamcast games, too. And they have great customer service.

47:12.880 --> 47:17.800
Yes, they do. Never buy anything from BuyRight. Or Toys and Joys.

47:17.800 --> 47:22.280
Actually, Toys and Joys has given me nothing but good service. Really? Jerks.

47:22.280 --> 47:26.200
I bought my, uh, my guitar controllers for, um, guitar freaks

47:26.200 --> 47:29.980
from them for cheaper than anywhere else had them and they had just got their

47:29.980 --> 47:34.400
shipment in and packed it up that day we caught we did a phone order hmm I got it

47:34.400 --> 47:38.160
within like a week I have not shopped at any of those stores I've used to place

47:38.160 --> 47:41.200
in the past called Japan video games because I went to their actual store

47:41.200 --> 47:45.520
once and so I've been loyal ever since now we that's where I got my drum

47:45.520 --> 47:49.020
controller from but now we just sort of take the drive to Berlin game and go to

47:49.020 --> 47:53.560
network isn't network closed didn't they just close recently I don't think so

47:53.560 --> 47:57.480
Cuz we were trying to go there the other day. They are closed on a weird day. I think they're closed on Tuesday

47:58.480 --> 48:00.480
Anyway, we gotta go. Okay. Sorry

48:00.560 --> 48:02.560
Yeah, worldwide show guys

48:03.440 --> 48:07.940
Actually, that was the last email. Okay. All right, then send us more email more more more

48:07.940 --> 48:14.440
We crave it mailbag orange on twitter.com. It's where to send it. All right, we will reveal the list list winner

48:14.960 --> 48:22.640
Listless winner very soon. However, we have a couple stories real quick for you guys. Oh, what's this next week?

48:22.640 --> 48:27.300
we will be rolling out a contest that's right we're not gonna say anything about

48:27.300 --> 48:32.960
it but make sure that you tell everyone to tune in next Sunday because we also

48:32.960 --> 48:36.080
of course it's going to be repeated on our podcast but we the first details

48:36.080 --> 48:39.840
will be on our life so we're working with somebody else to do it yes it's a

48:39.840 --> 48:48.400
big thing all right all right uh Loki you got a story for us yes I do now

48:48.400 --> 48:55.140
Anyways, before I was playing with all this stuff here, basically we have information

48:55.140 --> 49:00.300
and it's not really much of a surprise because we knew this was going to happen, but they're

49:00.300 --> 49:06.420
going to be announcing DOA Extreme Beach something 2 at E3.

49:06.420 --> 49:11.660
Now, I'm not sure if it's going to be volleyball this time because I heard basketball is in

49:11.660 --> 49:18.380
the room or they're going to do, but basically, yes, the jiggly game will be shown at E3.

49:18.380 --> 49:32.860
Let's go on over to another story here I have on credit cards.

49:32.860 --> 49:38.460
Now there's this interesting article here on makezine.com on their blog over there.

49:38.460 --> 49:42.780
It's entitled, The Future of Credit Cards, Earning Virtual Currency for Spending in the

49:42.780 --> 49:44.980
Real World and Other World Bridging.

49:44.980 --> 49:46.580
I'm going to make this real quick.

49:46.580 --> 49:47.900
I'm going to sum this up.

49:47.900 --> 49:52.460
You know how sometimes credit cards give you rewards, such as frequent flyer miles and

49:52.460 --> 49:54.940
things of that sort for every dollar that you spend?

49:54.940 --> 50:01.380
Well now they're thinking of, why not give in-game currency as a reward for spending

50:01.380 --> 50:02.460
money?

50:02.460 --> 50:07.180
That would just screw up whatever currency, whatever economy you've got going on in that

50:07.180 --> 50:08.180
environment.

50:08.180 --> 50:13.900
So when you use your credit card on in-game currency, you can score more in-game currency?

50:13.900 --> 50:15.540
Essentially.

50:15.540 --> 50:17.400
Excellent.

50:17.400 --> 50:20.280
So just kind of interesting there, it's a very lengthy blog, I'm not going to read all

50:20.280 --> 50:24.000
the details there, if you want to check it out for yourself, check out from March 2006

50:24.000 --> 50:26.960
there was a blog there, but it's just now, I mean it's an old blog, but it's just now

50:26.960 --> 50:32.360
making the rounds on the gaming blogs, makezine.com is the name of the site there, and they go

50:32.360 --> 50:35.520
into a lot of details there, but it's certainly an interesting idea, I mean nobody's really

50:35.520 --> 50:40.400
thought of that before, but I don't know, most MMO hardcore players I know that might

50:40.400 --> 50:45.640
actually sign up for something like this also hate gold sellers and gill sellers or whatever

50:45.640 --> 50:47.440
the currency is in the game you're playing.

50:47.440 --> 50:51.640
So I don't see this working, because I think there's a conflict of interest there, but

50:51.640 --> 50:55.760
whatever floats your boat.

50:55.760 --> 50:57.920
Shall we reveal the winners of tonight's list list?

52:36.840 --> 52:41.000
whatever if you don't want us to wait till e3 we'll talk to you now all right

52:41.000 --> 52:46.160
let's go to skype line hello you are on orange lounge radio hi hi who's this

52:46.160 --> 52:52.120
Ravens dolphin hello Ravens dolphin what's on your mind buddy uh the UMD

52:52.120 --> 52:58.900
movies yes what about them you a fan of UMD movies not at all I'm glad they're

52:58.900 --> 53:06.300
going away. Why? Why? Because I haven't bought one since that movie. I bought one movie on

53:06.300 --> 53:12.140
it. What was that? Evil Dead. That was about it. Well that's a good choice. You have good

53:12.140 --> 53:16.820
taste in movies. It's all about Bruce Campbell and his chin. I suppose if you're going to

53:16.820 --> 53:23.220
buy one UMD you might as well buy that or Tron or Evil Bill. Labyrinth. Something cool.

53:23.220 --> 53:28.180
Starring David Bowie and his... Why the hate for the UMDs then? Were you just not impressed

53:28.180 --> 53:29.800
with Evil Dead?

53:29.800 --> 53:33.380
No, I was impressed with it. It's just I'm getting all my movies off BitTorrent

53:33.380 --> 53:36.200
and I'm just encoding it on my computer.

53:36.200 --> 53:40.440
I guess that's the realistic world of what PSP has to deal with is that

53:40.440 --> 53:42.280
you know the kids want to hack it

53:42.280 --> 53:45.240
and put their own movies on there so

53:45.240 --> 53:49.680
it's a questionable legality thing there but I guess that's what people

53:49.680 --> 53:52.840
are doing. Well the other thing too is they're also pushing these larger memory

53:52.840 --> 53:56.920
sticks and what the hell are you going to use them for? Obviously not pictures. You're going to be ripping

53:56.920 --> 54:00.380
DVDs or whatever to downloading great podcasts like orange lounge radio

54:00.960 --> 54:02.960
Okay, but still though

54:03.060 --> 54:08.300
Every week on my PSP. All right. All right. I hear you. Have you checked out olr PSP calm?

54:09.800 --> 54:14.040
Can I plug another podcast right another site? Oh, all right. Sure

54:14.840 --> 54:17.760
PSP drive calm it has your webs your

54:18.480 --> 54:24.380
I've heard of that. I've seen our listing on PSP drive calm. It's a good site. I've actually used the portal. It's a nice site

54:24.380 --> 54:31.820
yeah they have a PSP 2.0 and I just downloaded wirelessly to the PSP yeah

54:31.820 --> 54:35.500
they were supporting podcasts before Sony was I think I think it's a good

54:35.500 --> 54:40.500
site so yes and I see I've seen our little teeny like reduced version of our

54:40.500 --> 54:43.100
graphic on there for PSP so I think is really cool because somebody obviously

54:43.100 --> 54:47.060
had to take the work to do that so I really appreciate those guys so that's

54:47.060 --> 54:52.300
awesome yeah oh I just want to say that I have two Windows computers just like

54:52.300 --> 54:56.760
Loki uh-huh he's a big Windows supporter and I support Windows just like he does

54:56.760 --> 55:00.480
well it's it's good to hear from a Loki fan because sometimes we get the hate

55:00.480 --> 55:04.600
mails from the Mac users so all right have a good one okay thanks for calling

55:04.600 --> 55:10.240
buddy hmm thanks guy not a problem take care of course if you don't know what

55:10.240 --> 55:14.520
we're referring to their Loki has made comments about Macintosh's and he's

55:14.520 --> 55:20.240
really sick of hearing about it too I think I'm yeah I just really I don't

55:20.240 --> 55:23.240
don't care that's what happens when people download a show that's weeks and

55:23.240 --> 55:28.820
weeks old let's go over to this one hello you're on orange lounge radio hey

55:28.820 --> 55:36.880
I'm just hello hi who's this oh oh it's Ron McCallen in right now look you can

55:36.880 --> 55:40.280
see the video of Rama there but the problem is Rama when you run in the

55:40.280 --> 55:44.000
video it's really hard for us to hear you but there there is a little little

55:44.000 --> 55:48.480
Zelda hat that's that's cute Rama call back turn off the video and call oh

55:48.480 --> 55:49.480
There it is.

55:49.480 --> 55:50.480
It went off.

55:50.480 --> 55:51.480
There you go.

55:51.480 --> 55:52.480
Much better.

55:52.480 --> 55:53.480
Much better.

55:53.480 --> 55:54.480
What's on your mind?

55:54.480 --> 55:55.480
Hey, I want to cover a couple of things for you guys.

55:55.480 --> 55:56.480
Okay.

55:56.480 --> 55:57.720
Remember when you were talking about Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors?

55:57.720 --> 56:00.480
Yes, the game that was like, yeah, it ran on, I don't know.

56:00.480 --> 56:01.920
I'm glad you called in on this.

56:01.920 --> 56:02.920
What's up?

56:02.920 --> 56:08.000
It seems that when I was listening to Penn Gillette's radio, his podcast, he talked about

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
the game.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
Really?

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
What did he say?

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Yes.

56:12.000 --> 56:16.080
He used, basically the play of Smoke and Mirrors was to go after Janet Reno who hated violent

56:16.080 --> 56:17.080
video games.

56:17.080 --> 56:20.600
That's fabulous.

56:20.600 --> 56:25.320
That's funny. I'm posting a link in the chat room now. If you scroll down you'll

56:25.320 --> 56:27.360
find where you can download it. It's called

56:27.360 --> 56:33.040
Penn & Teller's Real Life Games. Alright, it's 923-free-fm.com and you can

56:33.040 --> 56:35.400
probably navigate the site from there if you're not in chat right now.

56:35.400 --> 56:39.760
Yeah. Alright. Okay, what else, Rama? What else is on your mind?

56:39.760 --> 56:43.240
Alright, let's go back to Catscom for a bit. Remember the awesome

56:43.240 --> 56:46.640
Zelda skit everybody was talking about? Yes, the one I didn't see.

56:46.640 --> 56:53.000
I'm posting a link to it right now. Oh, you can download it. Yeah, if you could scroll that all the way down

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
It's called katsu

56:55.040 --> 57:00.420
2006 dash link. Okay, and that video is on the website usagi-chan three dot-com

57:00.420 --> 57:04.760
So check that out. All right post in our forums or something so people can find that link later

57:04.760 --> 57:08.920
Did you guys see that Zelda fan movie? It's so amazing. I heard about it

57:08.920 --> 57:14.540
Oh, that was awesome. It missed the cut for tonight's show, but because it's not really official but it's it's interesting

57:14.540 --> 57:19.380
It would be interesting if they actually finish it and and and release it

57:19.380 --> 57:25.060
But don't you think Nintendo is gonna bring down the swift hammer of justice on that matter necessarily. It's just fan stuff

57:25.380 --> 57:30.380
It's just lunch on you need to you need to come to Fana me with us bottom a 2007

57:30.580 --> 57:34.180
She died. We'll be here. All right, if our panels go over well

57:34.180 --> 57:38.780
Did you tell your friends in the anime community to come to our panels? I mean

57:39.380 --> 57:41.380
Unlike they did at Katsu khan

57:41.380 --> 57:45.380
Look, you got screwed over. Believe you me, I'm just as pissed as you are.

57:45.380 --> 57:48.380
I had to put a dig in there somehow. It's fine. I learned a lot. I learned a lot.

57:48.380 --> 57:51.380
I did make sure to specify that our panel is on a Saturday.

57:51.380 --> 57:56.380
Very cool. And I met some great people at Katsukana. That's the important thing.

57:56.380 --> 57:58.380
So, that's the important thing.

57:58.380 --> 58:01.380
And now there's a guy out there handing out flyers for us. It's awesome.

58:01.380 --> 58:03.380
I love our fans. They're so great.

58:03.380 --> 58:06.380
Rama, I gotta let you go so we can get to more of our listeners, okay?

58:06.380 --> 58:07.380
You take care.

58:07.380 --> 58:08.380
Have a good one, buddy.

58:08.380 --> 58:12.900
good to hear, oop, I just cut him off sorry didn't mean to alright let's go to another call here

58:12.900 --> 58:18.980
hello you're on Orange Launch Radio hello you are on Orange Launch Radio

58:18.980 --> 58:22.520
no they're not, hello, hi who's this

58:22.520 --> 58:27.620
this is Xander from China, hi Xander from China what's on your mind

58:27.620 --> 58:31.100
isn't it kinda late over there right now

58:31.100 --> 58:34.500
or early I don't know alright fine what's on your mind, 3 in the morning

58:34.500 --> 58:40.500
Yeah, I've been talking about Kingdom Hearts 2 since it came out on Wednesday.

58:40.500 --> 58:43.500
You wanna talk about what? You were dropping a little bit there. What game?

58:43.500 --> 58:44.500
Kingdom Hearts 2.

58:44.500 --> 58:47.500
Oh, what do you want to say about Kingdom Hearts 2?

58:47.500 --> 58:51.500
I'm like 17 hours into it right now.

58:51.500 --> 58:52.500
Yeah?

58:52.500 --> 58:59.500
So, yeah, obviously I'm liking it quite a bit because otherwise I wouldn't have bothered going through all the stupid cutscenes.

58:59.500 --> 59:04.420
Mm-hmm, but um, I think that's probably one of my biggest complaints about the game is that the cutscenes are really

59:05.620 --> 59:11.580
They're really low quality in all honesty. Most of them are really I think the cutscenes have been great so far

59:12.180 --> 59:17.500
Well, how far are you? I'm all I've just passed Beastcast. No, I'm in that

59:17.500 --> 59:19.080
Well, I just got into the hundred acre wood

59:19.080 --> 59:22.220
So I'm not super far but you know far enough to get a good taste

59:22.460 --> 59:25.860
Especially after that prologue far enough to get a good taste of what the game's all about

59:26.420 --> 59:28.420
So yeah

59:28.420 --> 59:38.420
The worst one for me, though, that ruined it, was the one in Mulan, when the guys, whatever his face is, is charging down the mountain with all the Heartless.

59:38.420 --> 59:40.420
Okay, don't ruin too much, don't ruin too much.

59:40.420 --> 59:42.420
I played that part at E3, that was pretty awesome.

59:42.420 --> 59:44.420
I like the Mulan world.

59:44.420 --> 59:52.420
But no, during that cutscene, in the movie, there's this really dramatic music playing as he's running down the mountain with all his thousands of soldiers and whatnot.

59:52.420 --> 59:57.400
Uh-huh, and then there's nothing there. There's like ten heartless chasing him and

59:57.920 --> 59:59.600
There's no music

59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.900
Are we I was so pissed off our chat rooms getting a little angsty with the spoilers thing

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:08.000
So we got to be careful what we say about the game, but I don't I I disagree

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.300
I thought it was but see I didn't see Mulan. So maybe that's why it's different as I didn't actually see Mulan

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.680
So I liked him on this by way

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:18.840
Have you gotten to the Little Mermaid level yet?

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:23.200
That level is cracked out.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.040
I hate their costumes.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.840
The part that's funny about that though is playing it in Japanese, hearing them sing

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.320
Under the Sea in Japanese is just hilarious.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:38.200
I can't believe it's a music game where you press one button.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.880
Xander, any other comments on Kingdom Hearts 2?

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.040
I've got to keep it moving because we've got a lot of people trying to call in tonight,

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.400
any other comments on Kingdom Hearts 2?

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.840
I'm really enjoying it, it's very different from the first game

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.340
so you know if you didn't like the first game you might like this one

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:55.600
although you wouldn't understand it if you didn't finish it. I agree but Miklotov

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.560
shaking his head no

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.920
because it still has a bad camera. It's much better, much better.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:03.960
Still bad. All you do is lock on to the target and the camera follows it, it's easy.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.360
In the first game you would lock on and the camera would still go behind

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.240
smokes and mirrors and everything and it made it a pain in the ass but this one's much

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:10.640
better.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:15.920
I actually disagree on that really the camera is actually worse than this one. I had less problems screw you people

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.280
Okay, you know what though? I'll tell you what my favorite part so far

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.000
I know I just played this part, but that I don't want to give spoilers

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.140
But the the boss fight in Beast's castle was awesome

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:35.360
It was awesome. The end one. Yes, don't say much more. It was awesome. Oh, man. Yeah, that was good

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:39.740
All right, that's all I can say. Were you watching? Yeah, I was watching it. It was okay

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:44.160
I had a bad camera. All right, Xander. I gotta let you go before a shame pisses me off more. Okay?

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.780
Okay. All right. Have a good one. Bye

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:51.700
All right. Let's go. I'll do one more call. Hello. You're on orange launch radio

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.340
Hello, can you hear me? Yes, what's on your mind?

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:01.900
Um

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:05.700
I'm in a really hacky mood. You're in a hacky mood

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:10.800
Yeah, I've been hacking a lot of things recently, like physically.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.800
Who is this, by the way?

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:12.800
I forgot to ask who this is.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.800
Who is this?

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:14.800
Oh.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.800
NintendoManiac64.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800
Hello NintendoManiac64.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.300
Have you been hacking your Nintendo, or what have you been hacking?

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:24.020
No, I have a 360 controller that I use for my PC.

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:29.380
I modded the buttons and stuff, so I can pretty much make any button layout I want.

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:32.300
You know, I haven't even thought about doing that.

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:35.460
I read that on a forum this week, somebody just casually said putting their controller

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.680
in the PC and I thought that's a really good idea I could use that for like

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:42.120
Final Fantasy and stuff does that work can I just plug it in and go or do I

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.960
have to hack it? You don't have to you can download the the drivers off of

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.160
Microsoft's site and I was asking the caller no that's fine that's fine but

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.680
those drivers suck I don't know they worked fine for me what did you what did you find drivers out

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:59.340
there you can get them off redcloud.com I'll post the link all right yeah post

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:02.380
the link I'll check that out because I want to use it for Final Fantasy 11 on the

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:06.380
Which is ironic because I want to get Final Fantasy XI on 360. I'm so sad.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:09.380
Yes, we are sad. Yeah, you're doing it too.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:14.380
What do you find that you're using the Xbox 360 controller for on the PC?

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:17.380
Are you emulating games, or what are you doing with it?

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:23.380
I do some of that, but not much because my computers are so much crap that I can't do much of that.

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:31.380
Like, pretty much the main thing I do is I play F-Zero Climax.

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:38.460
that's cool very cool yeah all right I did some other hacking

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:44.540
okay what else let's see um oh yeah I got a my standard headset mic that I'm

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:50.300
using right now to work with my DS oh is that why you were saying in chat earlier

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:53.100
in the show that you really wanted to play Metroid with somebody for voice

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:57.580
chat yeah I wanted to test it out gotcha you know I played my first multiplayer

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:02.380
Metroid last night finally I owned at it I just like to say yeah it was when you

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:05.300
were sleeping it was fun good you were sleeping because you had to go to best

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:08.740
by at 3 a.m. because you were afraid there was gonna be a huge line yeah I'm

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:12.620
stupid all right there's no maniac 64 I gotta let you go because we're running

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.860
really long here but have a good one okay okay all right bye-bye

01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:20.100
all right thanks to our callers tonight for calling in and all the calls went

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:23.300
pretty well tonight I must say it was very good I'm sorry to those calls we

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:28.820
didn't get to another time perhaps we'll see all right for now though we're going

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:33.860
to get into the last few segments here in the show and we started off with any

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:36.660
last-minute stories does anybody have any last-minute stories I want to share

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:43.860
Dark Sakura yes remakes remakes are good things especially when it has to do with

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:50.740
sometimes yeah well Panzer Dragoon and Die Hard okay I've got my attention okay

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:55.460
um apparently there's going to be um well actually there's a little bit of talk about

01:04:56.020 --> 01:05:01.220
them wanting to do a panzer dragoon orta remake which for anyone who knows about this in japan

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:07.540
it was a panzer dragoon rpg um but it's really hard to get your hands on however though for the

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:12.900
sega ages collection there is a panzer dragoon collection and uh die hard which was a dynamite

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:19.060
deka in japan um but however keep in mind these are sega ages these are meant to be

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:29.500
cheap the Sega Aegis 2900 is named 2900 for 2900 yen as in really cheap I'm

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:35.120
sorry 2500 my apologies so um don't expect them to be you know made uber

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:40.180
pretty all gorgeous everything but they are supposed to be retouched looking

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:44.740
better and so what should be a good thing because I really liked the dynamite

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:50.880
Deca series and Panzer Dragon was really neat so should be fun all right I

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.960
actually did find them up for a pre-order on a couple sites I like those

01:05:54.960 --> 01:06:00.840
Sega Ages games unlike some people so well Fantasy Star 2 was just released on

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:05.440
the Sega Ages but we haven't seen the trend you know any translations for

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.760
these come out yet we've been basically playing them when our we have a friend

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:19.760
But the remakes are really nice, and of course I have the Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier remakes, which are really, really nice.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:27.760
So, I can vouch for these SEGA Ages collections. Quite a bit of these have been re-released.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.760
I also like that SEGA and Ages are, you know...

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:37.960
not acronyms, but when you shuffle the words, the letters around.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.960
Anagrams?

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.960
Anagrams.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.960
Thank you.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.960
You're welcome.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.960
Oh, you're so smart.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.960
I am.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:44.960
Is that how you get jobs with video game companies?

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.960
Yes.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.960
You're a smart feller.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.960
All right.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:50.000
Loki, anything for us last minute wise?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.680
Yeah, the first thing I was going to mention is that the cheat device for Grand Theft Auto

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.880
Liberty City Stories is finally 1.0 now, and they added a few things.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:09.880
Hover Cars, which is pretty cool, Gather Spell, which causes the objects on the screen to basically hover around some fixed gravity point or something like that and you can throw them at stuff.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:19.880
They have a full-size video recorder now, and also drivable RC toys, which is pretty neat, and the gangs no longer attack you.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:25.880
So, if you're interested in that, you can actually find that at maxbot.com slash GTA.

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:34.880
And the other thing that I saw was Earthworm Jims coming to next-gen stuff, next-gen consoles, so that's kind of cool.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:40.880
And, well, that's pretty much it, lots of Oblivion sheets.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.880
So.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:49.880
Alright. Any other last minute stories? Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.880
Alright, Beeler?

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:55.960
I don't have any really good fuzzy uh... last news story of the night so sorry to

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.720
say so that brings us to the end of the show

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.080
April Fool's Day kind of screwed everything up this week news wise so

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.160
what can you do

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.520
uh... anyway

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.840

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.440

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:39.400
final thought? Yes. Alright, Loki, what's your final thought? My final

01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:43.400
thought is, I may be buying a laptop this week.
