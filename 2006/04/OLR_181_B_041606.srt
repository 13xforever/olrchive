00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 181 for this April the 16th of 2006.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,920
Pretty exciting first half there. Lots of news from some

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,280
no-name site you've probably never heard of before and some other fun stuff in there too.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,240
Kingdom Hearts 2, Metroid Prime 3, all that good stuff. But now

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,180
we're gonna start off this half of the show first by saying hello to Spike

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,800
who's joining us for this half of the show. Whoa. Deja-fu.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,680
Hey! How you doing? Doing pretty good. Weren't you just here a week ago and then

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
like two weeks before that?

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,080
You're becoming quite the little regular on our program. It's awesome.

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,040
You guys are so cool.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,200
Oh, but you're cool, Spike. That's why we like having you on the show.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,720
Well, thank you. First off, tell us how your gaming week was. What'd you play this week?

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,960
This week I spent some more time with the first Kingdom Hearts, finishing it up

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,520
so I can start the second one, which I've finally acquired.

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,240
Spent a little bit of time with Final Fantasy XI.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,240
Same old as it's been the last few weeks now.

20
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,520
Very cool.

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,400
Uh, you also brought some games for me to play, but I haven't gotten a chance to play

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,100
them yet. What did you bring for me to play?

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,120
uh... gosh i brought

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,060
the gameboy advance version of space channel five

25
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,040
which just sounds god-awful in concept but we'll see

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,340
it's it's simon says committees what can be said about that okay

27
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,700
uh... i brought along the britain of course for the p s one it's a classic

28
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,960
that i've seen before but it is a classic

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,140
yeah it's it's a pretty common one but

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,060
on the off chance uh...

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,460
the main one that i was excited to bring to you was primal image which we talked

32
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,360
about last week. That's right, Primal Image was the Pokemon Snap with super models, right?

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,080
Oh yeah, except I played it again, I mean they don't really look like super models.

34
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:08,600
Just people. Super market models. Super whores. Yes. Alright. Sounds awesome. Alright, one

35
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,880
system that is getting a lot of attention lately with all the things you can do with

36
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,520
it is the Nintendo DS, and we thought we'd start this segment of the show off with some

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,720
hacking news. Loki, what's going on with Nintendo DS, hack-wise?

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,720
Well, hack-wise, you know, they've done some really cool things like

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,400
at E3 last year they have this thing called the DS Download Station

40
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,960
and you can actually download, you know, demos of games

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,680
to your DS and these have actually started to roll out into stores now

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,600
and, you know, you might see them at a local Best Buy or

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,000
You know, that type of thing. The only thing is, if you don't have one nearby, what are

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
you to do? What are you to do? Well, build your own. That's right. Actually, plans were

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,880
put up on the internet on how to build your own DS station. And they have the files out

46
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,080
there to do it and a whole tutorial. It's pretty simple. You just basically need to

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:18,640
get an RT2500 based Wi-Fi card in your computer, or sometimes your laptop will have one too

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:27,320
because you can do the PCMI card, and can I do it on my Apple? You might be able to,

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm not sure. I'll have to try it. I'm not sure. But they have a whole list of stuff

50
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,320
that's available to basically do this. And all the demos that they have on here, which

51
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,340
I'm sure I don't know how they got the demos off the demo station, but they're all the

52
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,760
ones that are currently out there now, brain training and all that fun stuff, so if you

53
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,560
really want to do it, I wanted to get this done on my laptop so we could actually do

54
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,280
it in the studio, maybe for next week, but uh...

55
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,520
Isn't it just a matter of time before they figure out a way to beam the games over, not

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,800
just the demo, but possibly the whole freaking games?

57
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,760
I'm not sure if they can store that much on there.

58
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,040
Ah, okay.

59
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,920
But still, it's interesting.

60
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,080
And apparently, though, if you do have a Game Boy Advance flash cart, you can record the

61
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,020
games to that, and there's a way around where you can actually play them off of that, too.

62
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,860
Nintendo's probably a little irked at this news, probably.

63
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,360
For those folks who maybe live in a remote part, I think what would be very interesting

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,740
is using this in other countries.

65
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,140
I think some folks who are in other countries, like Japan, the UK, who might not be seeing

66
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,860
these games for a little while otherwise and even the demos can play these long

67
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,700
before they're released in those in that well not Japan so much maybe the UK

68
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,460
released in that country yeah I think that's pretty cool or the other thing is

69
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,000
maybe modified to put homebrew on there to play homebrew games that you can

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,360
transfer via Wi-Fi without having to have all this fancy stuff that might be

71
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,840
an idea comment from our chat room over at orangelanatrader.com click on chat

72
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,160
gamerdude1212 says Nintendo hates all this piracy stuff I don't doubt it

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,200
I don't doubt it at all, I'm sure they do. Most companies do hate it.

74
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,680
So, it's probably not going to be an issue later because think about it

75
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,560
the Virtual Console, the fact that the Revolution

76
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,280
is going to have Wi-Fi, the fact that it's going to be able to hook up to the DS

77
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,800
you'll probably be able to download these for free off of the DS

78
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,840
or the Revolution anyways, so what's the big deal? How cool would that be anyway to

79
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,120
you know go to Nintendo.com and download something that you can beam

80
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,000
forget this whole store, why not bypass the kiosks in stores?

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,180
and be able to download demos to your DS

82
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,440
just like you can on Xbox Live, but you do it through your computer. I think they

83
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,960
should be endorsing this stuff, not turning their back on it.

84
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,000
But, yeah, whatever. What do I know?

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,440
I do know this, Xbox Live is going to be doing another free week,

86
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,840
but it's during the week of E3. This time it's not just, I don't think it's just

87
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,200
one weekend. I think it's actually doing a whole week. No, I'm sorry, it is just one

88
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,680
weekend.

89
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,920
But the weekend that they're gonna be doing this is May 8th.

90
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,980
no it is it is a full week because running through May 15th

91
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,540
and it's going to be sponsored by

92
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,820
well I'm not sure I thought I saw the name of the sponsor there

93
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,440
I thought

94
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,460
not FIFA, well FIFA World Cup Soccer 2006 might hit the marketplace during that

95
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,320
same week

96
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,520
it wasn't FIFA it was a shoe brand that was

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,800
doing it I can't remember

98
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,240
I'm trying to see if I can find it here. Adidas.

99
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,120
Adidas, that's it. They're doing it. I knew I could find it, yay!

100
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,280
Adidas all day I dream about.

101
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,000
Sorry, I can't help, my mind just can't help but go there.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,880
Good idea, bad idea to do this during the week of E3.

103
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,200
Because most of the hardcore gamers will be either at E3

104
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,680
or glued to their computers reading updates on E3.

105
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,680
So is this a smart thing to do?

106
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,240
you know, announce a new game or something, and be like, Hey! Right now you can go play a demo

107
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,440
on Xbox Live Arcade. That would be very cool. You think they would actually do that?

108
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,080
Play the demos that they're playing at E3? Download them right now? No way.

109
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,080
Why not? Because they just don't do that. Or maybe limited ones.

110
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,240
Maybe, but what is is there anything so wrong with putting those demos out there

111
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,000
on Xbox Live for everybody to play?

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,640
Is it just because the games are usually half finished or what? There is actually one

113
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,360
out on

114
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,260
Xbox Live now the Tomb Raider one right well there's doing there's they have

115
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:32,080
several of those things I think it would be a good idea but not like have it be

116
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,180
like a specific download like you have a certain amount of points you can

117
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,160
download it something like that I mean how cool would that be that this is the

118
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,600
closest you can get to e3 you know right here you live and play the same demo

119
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
they're all playing at e3 right now I think they'll be great publicity stunt

120
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,540
Especially since, bless their hearts, they decided to not give everybody who works for

121
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,460
anyone who sells video games passes.

122
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:04,660
So it is going to reduce the amount of people who are going to be able to go to E3.

123
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,140
Somehow this no-name site got in, though, which is amazing.

124
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,140
We actually report.

125
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,140
I know.

126
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,500
We're a legitimate business, believe it or not.

127
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,300
We don't work in the garden section at Walmart.

128
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Exactly.

129
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,940
One thing that I could see turning a lot of prospective developers away from that, though,

130
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,400
is that the average E3 demo is nowhere near as polished as a demo you might get on a demo

131
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
disk.

132
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,940
And a lot of people who are casually downloading off the marketplace might be using this as,

133
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,440
you know, is this my final decision on purchasing this game?

134
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,580
And that would definitely scare a lot of people away.

135
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,100
You play a demo of an unfinished game.

136
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,360
It's not very good.

137
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,540
You don't come back to it six months later when it's really ready to be played.

138
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,160
I guess that's a very good point and it makes me think about, you know, the Tomb Raider.

139
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,340
I completely judge my opinion of the Tomb Raider game based on the demo, there's no

140
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,460
way in hell I'm buying the game, I didn't enjoy the demo at all.

141
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,140
That's just my personal opinion, I understand a lot of people are liking the game, but I

142
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,740
found it to be really frickin' boring.

143
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,820
But I guess you're right, but I think about some of the really creative E3 demos I've

144
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,300
seen, like remember the Weheart Katamari demo last year?

145
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,620
It was specifically made for E3, and like the king would be talking about E3.

146
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,620
It was great, who wouldn't want to play that?

147
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,220
I mean, it was awesome. But I do get that point of the half-finished demos.

148
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,640
You make an even better point, though. Maybe developers should be making

149
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,820
specific demos to be downloaded for this free weekend

150
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
that would target them and make them feel like they're a part of something.

151
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,140
I think a lot of gamers would really go for,

152
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,100
oh, this developer is targeting me. I want to play this.

153
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,340
You know what? We need to start an Xbox development company. Right now.

154
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,020
I have a better idea. Green Lounge Gaming. How about this?

155
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,520
What?

156
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,740
How about we sell 360 games with hamburgers?

157
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,300
Ah, I love this idea.

158
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,420
I love this idea.

159
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,340
Can any of us cook?

160
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,100
Oh, how about this?

161
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,860
No, I got it.

162
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,620
Excuse me.

163
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,300
Xbox Live with Super Bacon.

164
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,660
OK, my stomach is just turned really awfully now.

165
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,700
I feel nauseous.

166
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,580
I feel nauseous too, but now I want Super Bacon.

167
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,100
All right, anyway, moving on.

168
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,660
One Xbox Live, or one Xbox title, I should say,

169
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,440
general has been turning heads is oblivion right low-key oblivion has

170
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,380
been turning heads and it's been selling and selling and selling I want to say

171
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:28,320
2.5 million that's a lot of copies a lot of copies no I think selling these nude

172
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,180
patch oh yeah is that all there is to say it's just sold a lot no not at all

173
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,580
I'm just bullshitting no no basically you know it's got a really good score

174
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,580
I don't know a lot of magazines that reviewed it

175
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:49,540
They've sold over 100 or 1.7 million units of oblivion for the PC and the 360

176
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
since they've shipped

177
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,140
from watch and

178
00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:00,940
Just you know, it's been on the covers of magazines. It's just really good. It's basically it's ended world hunger

179
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,700
It's basically accounted for it found Osama bin Laden. It's amazing

180
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:12,440
It was it accounted for 13% of all PC game sales in the first week since it was released and by the way the other

181
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,340
87% was World of Warcraft amazingly

182
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,980
Go figure

183
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,880
You know what I want to know what where the hell is my free feel, I don't know

184
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,500
I

185
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,700
Like comments in our chairman see now now they're taking this orange launch radio pack in games concept really far

186
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,100
And I like this concept idea from Jeremy Todd one push-button receive bacon

187
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,260
That's a great game concept. Hey Jeremy Todd. You know how to program games. We need to get them on our staff

188
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,500
Can you program I think you know?

189
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,740
I think we should do all of our games in Commodore 64 basic because I know how to program in Commodore 64 basic

190
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,060
Is there a way we spikes doing this you me you yep?

191
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,540
Let's program some games in Commodore 64 basic and somehow find somebody to port them to the Xbox 360

192
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,940
I'll be awesome.

193
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,960
You have banana, throw YN question mark.

194
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,080
You have bacon, eat YN.

195
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,880
Syntax error, ready.

196
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:23,160
Speaking of Xbox Live, Saints Row is going to be having a very large demo going to the

197
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,280
Xbox Live Marketplace.

198
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,660
The game is going to be released the third quarter of this year.

199
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,640
Saints Row, though, we don't know much about multiplayer in this game.

200
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,860
There are going to be some multiplayer modes and multiplayer maps.

201
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,580
Basically it's kind of like Grand Theft Auto.

202
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,820
I don't know, you get the same impression for this game, Loki?

203
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,820
The Saints Row?

204
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,820
Yeah.

205
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,820
It's kinda...

206
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,940
It was supposed to be the Grand Theft Auto killer that never freaking came out.

207
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,940
Gotcha.

208
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,340
Well, it's on its way, and it's supposedly going to have multiplayer, so there's supposed

209
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,460
to be a very large demo coming to Xbox Live.

210
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,460
They just don't say when, just sometime before release.

211
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,460
You know what I say?

212
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,460
To hell with Satan's Row.

213
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,640
It's all about Crackdown.

214
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Crackdown is going to be awesome.

215
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,540
If you've gotten this month's official Xbox magazine, they have a trailer for Crackdown.

216
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,900
It's like Grand Theft Auto with basically a super human as the lead in it, so you can

217
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,400
throw cars at people.

218
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:20,320
Nothing says, give me my money, bitch, than throwing a fucking car into your head.

219
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,840
That takes me back to Nark.

220
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Very good.

221
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,940
The chat room is still talking about this game thing.

222
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,680
You know that we did have somebody make Orange Lounge Radio the game already.

223
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
That was Illusion.

224
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,520
One of our fans actually made that and it's in the forums.

225
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,560
But now people want to take this to the next level.

226
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,440
DJ Pooh Eater says that he knows the Flash programming.

227
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,160
I know Dark Soccer knows that too.

228
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,360
Maybe we could have them team up.

229
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,560
I know how to do ads.

230
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Open up the programming.

231
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
And I know how to do slideshows.

232
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,120
Well, maybe you could do the art and you could do the programming.

233
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,320
I'm halfway through my flash semester. You can make an awesome opening cinema.

234
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,160
There you go. There you go. I love this idea.

235
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,760
Can I do it for my homework? Sure.

236
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,200
If I get school credit for it, okay. I'll allow it.

237
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,000
Check that out on the forums. I think Illusion still has that up. I'm supposed to

238
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,300
put it on our MySpace or our website as well though. I

239
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,580
totally forgot. I forgot to send them a private message saying we can move it and

240
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,000
suck our home bandwidth away.

241
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,840
uh... they get it it's it's fabulous it's a text adventure

242
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,600
it's the most fun you'll ever have

243
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,960
playing orange lawns radio the game you had me at text adventure

244
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,400
i'm invincible

245
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,920
every time i type in an attack nothing will happen SPOILER

246
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,480
oh my god spoilers i can't believe you ruined the orange lawns radio

247
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,240
game for everybody i didn't say what happened i just said i'm invincible

248
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,780
and you know what happens on page two ninety

249
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,620
Jamie kills Dumbledore, it's amazing!

250
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,720
That's not a spoiler!

251
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,680
I didn't say what happens in the game, I just said I'm invincible.

252
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,860
Alright, Aerith died.

253
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,620
And I cheered!

254
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,640
I still have my memory card saved. Okay, you've told this story five times on the show.

255
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,160
More than that,

256
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,100
but I still think... It's like one of her crowning moments. It's something I'm very proud of.

257
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,080
I still have my file. You should sell that card on eBay, that memory card. Hell no!

258
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:21,720
Jamie saved game at dead era no no this memory card is special I buy it it's my first memory

259
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:28,980
card I ever had it's an off-brand one it has a tech it has a Sakura sticker on it and it

260
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:37,260
has all of my old Tekken 3 save files and bust to move so yeah that's that memory card

261
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:44,260
is special to me. Oh, and my Symphony of the Night files with 210%. Dork. Alright. Dark

262
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,020
Sakura likes to travel the world from her computer because she has buddies over in the

263
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,220
UK and she doesn't want them to feel left out. So she serves some of the UK news sites

264
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,380
to find out what's going on in gaming in the UK. What's going on in gaming. But of course,

265
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,260
you know, what goes on over there often affects what happens over here so we don't like to

266
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,920
think of it as necessarily UK only news it's just news from the UK nice

267
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,200
disclaimer you're welcome I find out you have to use them quite frequently with

268
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,640
you hey what's that supposed to mean nothing

269
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,360
heart yeah yeah yeah you need to just be nice to me because I hurt heart don't

270
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,280
make heart signs at me that's not gonna make me it's the olr gang sign a little

271
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,680
heart I think this should be the official olr gang sign make a heart with

272
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,540
your hands. If you don't know how to do it, we'll take a picture. You're retarded then.

273
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,820
There is a pic- SHUT UP! There is a picture of you.

274
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,300
Doing that? Doing hearts. Sweet. From the club. Sweet.

275
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,700
I'll put it up online. Alright, anyway, you can't use- You also look really silly in that picture too.

276
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,260
You can't use- No. I'm gonna do Brazil news now.

277
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,140
No. Um, I-

278
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,020
It's a Polish developer called, uh, Nebris, I guess is how it's pronounced.

279
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,460
They're working on a film noir inspired game for the revolution

280
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:01,580
called Sadness, which I automatically want to play it because it's very emo and goth.

281
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:07,220
But they are basing it off of movies like Sin City,

282
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,660
and they're saying the whole game is going to be done in black and white.

283
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,420
It's set before World War, we don't get any of the

284
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,140
depression, prohibition stuff, but you

285
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,420
get to complain about different things.

286
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,620
Sin City the game what?

287
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,900
It's based off of movies like Sin City.

288
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,980
Do we get chicks with guns? Because that was the best part of Sin City was chicks with guns.

289
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,340
Well seeing as how this is pre World War era

290
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,460
I don't think that's going to be very likely.

291
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,660
How about chicks with sword? There was a chick with a sword that was pretty hot in that movie.

292
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,260
I haven't seen Sin City. Spoiler!

293
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,540
You haven't seen Sin City. What is your problem?

294
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,100
need to go out right away and see this movie. I have something called a life

295
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,900
and I've had the movie since it came out on DVD. I feel Sin City was slightly overrated

296
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,300
but it's it's worth seeing. It's worth your time

297
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,140
on a rainy day. I have this thing that's called life

298
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,840
where I go to school. Next time you're sick with whatever plague you catch next okay on the

299
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,480
couch

300
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,300
instead of Kingdom Hearts 2 put that down and watch Sin City for a little bit.

301
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,940
I will if my husband makes me. Alright.

302
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,500
I still have to watch Uzumaki. Really weird Japanese movie.

303
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,620
That's a great film. UK News. Okay, oh yeah.

304
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,500
Um, Battle Royale 3, no. Ace Combat on PSP.

305
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,980
Ace Combat X, Skies of Deception. And I think it is X and not X, because they haven't

306
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,740
gone up to,

307
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,820
you know, past, what, five.

308
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,580
So, uh, it's going to be on the PSP.

309
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,580
Um, it's a combination campaign-based, uh,

310
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,860
single-player plane thingy with

311
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:57,060
Wireless multiplayer and speaking of numbers. I have not played one ace combat game. I have ace combat for okay

312
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,900
I

313
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,460
Actually, I've wasn't the first one on Super Famicom. I

314
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:09,980
Have not played one ace combat game original PlayStation. That's right. No, it's another game. I'm thinking of I'm thinking of

315
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,540
Anyway, it doesn't matter. It's not top gun. I don't care

316
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,060
Dude, Top Gun was awesome.

317
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,860
Top Gun's coming out for the DS.

318
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,860
Fuck yeah!

319
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,860
For me.

320
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
Fuck yeah!

321
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,300
But is it going to be incredibly difficult to land?

322
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,980
No, how hard is it going to be to refuel your damn plane?

323
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,980
Ugh.

324
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,980
Don't remind me.

325
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,980
Nightmares.

326
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:38,060
Famitsu stated that Namco said that Skies of Deception will feature an original storyline

327
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,980
all told through CG.

328

330
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:03,780
Foxhound. You know what they need to tie it in with? Ace Combat 6 Oblivion. Shut up.

We love Disney

346
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:04,100
They announced the PC MMO Pirates of the Caribbean online will be there to show at e3

347
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:12,060
But not on stores until 2007 it was supposed to launch with the next film coming out dead man's chest

348
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,340
In the summer, but it's gonna be later

381
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,540

382
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,560

00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,860
higher its I never mind you are the addict a puzzle higher

384
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,140
I it was a fun game I would like to know I I I'm that they have actually

385
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,500
announced the MMO last year at E3.

386
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,580
Oh, okay. They gave out these stupid gold coins that you would get

387
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,860
to go have special access to

388
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,940
the show floor or something

389
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,540
this year. So yeah, we knew it was coming.

390
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,700
Anyways, what we didn't know was coming though was this game coming from Acclaim

391
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,500
who's doing a martial arts MMO. That's right,

392
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:51,500
martial arts MMO. No one cares. Anyways, it's going to be called Nine Dragons, being developed

393
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:58,560
by Indie21. And it's supposed to be to put gamers in their own kung fu fighting online

394
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:06,460
game. Sounds kind of like Matrix Online to me, because that game is all kung fu. Anyways,

395
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:14,580
Anyways, um, it's currently being planned to be released later this year, so look for

396
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
that.

397
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,780
First off, why are there so many MMOs?

398
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,740
I mean, cause you may, cause not only do you get the sucker to buy the game at first, but

399
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,260
then you get them to pay for it every month, that's why.

400
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,060
Because we keep buying them?

401
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,060
I guess.

402
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,100
Where's my blaster master MMO?

403
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,000
Alright. You might remember one very popular MMO started on a Dreamcast,

404
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,580
on the Dreamcast, that was Phantasy Star. Although I don't know if I'd call Phantasy

405
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,060
Star so much an MMO

406
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,780
as it is like a multiplayer experience. It's a multiplayer

407
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,820
repetitive action game. Yes. Which I actually still occasionally play.

408
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,620
Alright. A story from

409
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,340
Retro Gaming has been circulating the

410
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,980
blogs, video game stuff out there this week. It's games that defined

411
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,380
the Dreamcast. So I thought maybe we could nerd out a little bit and talk

412
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,780
about the Dreamcast for a minute.

413
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,980
What do you think are some games that defined the Dreamcast?

414
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,740
Since you mentioned Phantasy Star Universe, I'd like to mention that Phantasy Star

415
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,580
Universe is supposed to be coming out on October 25th.

416
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,420
One of the ones I forgot to mention. Is that from your little list there? Yeah.

417
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,100
Alright, there you go.

418
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,180
Um, Blue Stinger.

419
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,820
Because, and I'm referring specifically to the Japanese version because the U.S.

420
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,980
version was ass.

421
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,860
As in not even a nice one as more like a stinky unwashed ass.

422
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,740
Thank you for that visual.

423
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:47,620
The Japanese one had these really massive camera angles, just cinematic, and even though

424
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:56,340
the gameplay was pretty beat thingy with stick, lightsaber, run up a tower, blah blah blah,

425
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,260
the camera angles I thought were just so neat.

426
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,420
It was such a different experience playing that as opposed to a lot of the stuff that

427
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,300
was on the PlayStation because you know you scroll out too far on PlayStation it would

428
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:11,440
just completely look crap but it's kept such a good look I mean it made it difficult to

429
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:18,400
play in places but you know I actually liked Boostinger. I traded my copy of the Dragon

430
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,080
Ball GT game. Alright. Which at the time was stupid because it was going for 150 bucks

431
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,920
on eBay. Oh we all make mistakes. Loki, Spike, any defining Dreamcast games for you? Power

432
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:35,420
Powerstone, Crazy Taxi, and Jet Set Radio.

433
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:44,540
That's another, um, crap, Evolution, actually, I thought, because it brought out, actually

434
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,100
Grandia 2 was also another good one.

435
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Space Channel 5.

436
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,100
Space Channel 5.

437
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,380
Spike, anything that comes to mind for you?

438
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,460
So Project Justice definitely comes to mind.

439
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
Amen!

440
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,620
Japanese one with the little board game.

441
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,180
Yes! That was so much fun and you could customize your character.

442
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,120
You know what though, I have to admit, I was a little upset that we didn't have

443
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,420
another school life mode like the Japanese PlayStation games.

444
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,780
Yeah, the second rival school that they did,

445
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,300
the Shiri to Justice Gakuen that they did, I actually, I paid 90 bucks to

446
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
import that thing.

447
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,660
Me too! Because I had such a hard time finding it, and

448
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,020
I loved playing through the high school mode, and I got wished happy birthday by Batsu.

449
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,020
Aww, see, I was always trying to get Nagare to fall in love with me.

450
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,020
I never did.

451
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,020
But it's the game that gave us the, uh...

452
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,020
You could play as, uh...

453
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,020
Ran?

454
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,020
As Ran, as, uh...

455
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,020
Nagare, and...

456
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,020
But, uh...

457
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,020
But, uh...

458
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,020
Moru, Justice Gakuen, gave us, um...

459
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,020
Zaki, who was...

460
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
The sex.

461
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,020
I actually...

462
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,020
One of my first pieces of fan art that ever got published by another site

463
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,460
was one of the big rival schools websites took a fan art I did of Zaki

464
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,780
you're listening to the geeky Dreamcast gamer podcast and of course we've got to

465
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:08,260
mention DDR second mix club version all right that was my first DDR that I owned

466
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,440
extrovert wants to participate in tonight's show by naming I guess

467
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,740
something a Dreamcast game I'm surprised that you didn't name it but Sonic

468
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:24,380
adventure right okay yeah and extra brings extra brings the show to a

469
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,500
screeching halt no I'm kidding no no Sonic Adventure was fun it is it's I

470
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:37,440
liked it actually one of my favorite games ever was was the berserk game

471
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,640
cuz we got it though before the anime came out over here and I was like when I

472
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,760
I found out that one of my favorite voice actors was Gatsu's voice.

473
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,120
I was like, okay, I'm importing this crap.

474
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,280
And so I went and found it for 20 bucks.

475
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,080
So now I have both versions of it.

476
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
But yeah.

477
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,880
And then I fell in love with the anime, but I'd still need to get the manga because it's

478
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,880
really messed up.

479
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,400
The manga is much better.

480
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,760
But it was a very good game.

481
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,360
Can I do another couple of Dreamcast games?

482
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,000
All right, real quick, then we gotta move on.

483
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,880
So like, we've got Ikaruga.

484
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,360
Yes.

485
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:17,040
The Dreamcast Direct version of Vampire Chronicles, much better than the Chaos Tower BS super

486
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,540
long load time PSP version.

487
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,600
There was also the For Matching Service series of Street Fighter games.

488
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,920
Yes, which, you know, SNK vs. Capcom 2, you know, because the game was meant to run on

489
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
a Naomi board.

490
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
Guilty Gear X.

491
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,520
Guilty Gear X, absolutely, although, you know.

492
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
Virtual On.

493
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,240
Oh yes.

494
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,640
And if you've got the twin sticks, oh yeah.

495
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,640
I bought the little Saturn adapter so I could use my Saturn twin sticks.

496
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,040
Ah, I still need Saturn twin sticks.

497
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,840
Alright, nerds, we gotta...

498
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,340
Did you ever have Dreamcast sex?

499
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,840
Alright, stop it.

500
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,640
Nerds, we gotta get to the chat room feedback here.

501
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,840
Dark Knight says SNK vs. Capcom 2.

502
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,340
Hitstun says Metropolis Street Racer.

503
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,540
Tigerclaw says don't forget Crazy Taxi on the Dreamcast.

504
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,140
And let's see, Amplitude says MVC 2.

505
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,540
Lots and lots of good choices.

506
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,020
GS-191 hit the nail on the head, C-Man.

507
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:16,980
The original story named these games, Soul Calibur, Shenmue, Jet Grind Radio, Space Channel

508
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:22,580
5, Crazy Taxi, Virtua Tennis and Tennis 2K2, Skies of Arcadia, the both Power Stone games,

509
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:28,260
both Sonic Adventure games, Samba de Amigo, hello, we started as a music thing, we should

510
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,620
have known about that one, Virtua Fighter, Echo the Dolphin, Defender of the Future,

511
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:39,340
Choo Choo Rocket, Phantasy Star Online, Street Fighter III Third Strike, Ikaruga, and import

512
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,260
games like Rez.

513
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,260
There was Rez.

514
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,260
Good stuff.

515
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,460
Alright, that was our Dreamcast geeky moment.

516
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,460
Enjoy.

517
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,300
Actually, I do have one of the crappiest games ever for Dreamcast.

518
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Shenmue?

519
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,580
No, it was import only super producers.

520
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,980
Where you managed the career of a pop idol.

521
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,820
You know what my favorite Dreamcast game is?

522
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,820
DC-ness.

523
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,820
Definitely.

524
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:12,340
You know what else game came out, was the roommate 2-1-3 or something, where you play

525
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,760
as some guy's roommate?

526
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,260
I thought of a really, really good one.

527
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
I thought of a really weird one.

528
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
What, what, what?

529
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
The Typing of the Dead.

530
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
Typing of the Dead!

531
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
Yay!

532
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
Yay, I win!

533
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,700
I get to participate in the geeky chat.

534
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,040
It also has spawned some of the best cosplay ever.

535
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,960
I plan on eventually doing some cosplay once people kind of forget about that game.

536
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,960
Alright, we really, really gotta move on, I'm sorry, alright.

537
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,040
Some people are saying that the Xbox 360 is kind of a new version of the Dreamcast, I

538
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,760
don't know, take it or leave it, but what's going on with Burnout on the Xbox 360, Loki?

539
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,520
They finally, finally fixed it.

540
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:56,320
So now I can play the damn car I downloaded off the Xbox 360 kiosk months ago.

541
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,080
Stupid bastards, teasing me at the damn car that I'd be able to play when I get the game

542
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,320
and couldn't play it for months.

543
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,880
Anyways, but, they did add some new cars to download as well online so you can get a bunch

544
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,080
of cars that they've hoarded out from different sponsors.

545
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:18,800
And one of the updates, well other than the cars, the kiosks working now, you cannot spam

546
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,800
your recommended clips to people on your recent players list.

547
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,440
In other words people that you just played in games you can't go hey look at my clip that I made that sucks

548
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
I just want to get achievements so there

549
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,960
I'm sure people are excited about that, but the burnout the burnout cars look pretty cool

550
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,560
They've got a spike TV car

551
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
They've actually got

552
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
yellow card car

553
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,920
uh...

554
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,880
it's like it

555
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,760
don't dole be car if you ever wanted to drive a shitty band now's your chance

556
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,480
i was sitting here like what's yellow card

557
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,480
thank you rob you're welcome

558
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,240
i did check it out a little bit

559
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,480
uh... or try to but the only thing i don't like it you have to unlock the

560
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,800
cars in the game

561
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,960
so picasa alright

562
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,080
go check that out

563
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,400
downloaded enjoy it

564
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,000
Uh, one person that will probably not be playing, yes?

565
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,600
The chat room just made me happy because they remembered Rod Caliber.

566
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,200
Dorks.

567
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,800
We're done with Dreamcast, we're done with Grant.

568
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,300
I know, but it has a special place in my heart.

569
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,300
We can never be done with Dreamcast.

570
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,700
One person that never touched a Dreamcast, you can be certain, is Jack Thompson, and

571
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,200
what's Jack up to this week, DarkSakura?

572
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,300
Jacky-poo is being a poopyhead.

573
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,900
Um, oh, I'm sorry, professionalism, right?

574
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,900
Um, well, he's filed suit against the Florida Bar Association.

575
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:50,580
So, basically, as reported by a Daily Business Review, also reposted with Game Politics,

576
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,580
who are heroes.

577
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,580
We love them.

578
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,420
Yeah, he's filed a million dollar federal lawsuit against the Florida Bar saying that

579
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:05,100
the organization is harassing him by investigating his baseless complaints.

580
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,140
One million dollars!

581
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:13,540
But, and I love what Game Politics commented on this, just a quote.

582
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,340
We're glad someone enjoys what Jack does, but we've reread the First Amendment umpteen

583
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,980
times and still can't find the right to annoy people.

584
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,180
Amen.

585
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,140
I love this post in our forums, if I could read this from our forums.

586
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:32,420
This is from one of my, I love this listener, he makes a lot of great posts on our forums

587
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
here.

588
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
The Ichiban Crush.

589
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,660
He posted the bunny picture on my MySpace.

590
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,980
We love our listeners, and this guy is just living proof.

591
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,500
I love this post he made.

592
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,380
Regarding Jacky Poo, I actually hope no one makes a game to his description.

593
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,940
This is a follow-up to last week's story where we talked about the whole Jack Thompson hates

594
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,660
Joystick and all that.

595
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,200
Because with his last modest proposal, what did he do?

596
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,020
Back out of his promise of donating $10,000 to charity when someone called his bluff.

597
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,900
Oh, and let's not even get into the hissy-fitsy targeted towards everyone who pointed out

598
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,420
Jack's lack of credibility or paid the fee on his behalf.

599
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:09,700
Why are we even giving a shit about this parasitic, ambulance chasing, morally bankrupted, failure

600
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,780
of a lawyer and human being anymore?

601
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,620
In the grand scheme of things, has he made an ounce of influence in the way we as gamers

602
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,340
or the game industry does its thing?

603
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,680
No, not at all.

604
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,800
What we have here is an over glorified internet troll.

605
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,260
Nothing more, nothing less.

606
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:27,220
His own actions weaken any and all chance for these holy crusades coming through.

607
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,740
This isn't even about fundamentalist antics anymore because it seems even those guys are

608
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,840
laughing at him.

609
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,900
So no, I wouldn't give him what he wants.

610
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,340
people to cry wolf about to the authorities it's trolls bait folks don't

611
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:45,180
bite love it love it should we even be reporting on him anymore I don't know I

612
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:49,600
feel like we have an obligation to but at the same time I totally get the

613
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,720
village idiot perspective I'm sick you know I'm really sick of everything

614
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,840
having to do with his name coming up you know we dealt with him what in the mid

615
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:03,480
90s over the whole cop killer thing mm-hmm you know for iced tea and now

616
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,400
Now we're dealing with him over video games.

617
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,680
See I would love to start like this big thing like podcasts against reporting on Jack Thompson.

618
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,800
I think it would be a great thing but then by doing that you would be reporting on it.

619
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,600
So I can't, I'm stuck.

620
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,320
I don't know what to do.

621
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,800
Podcasts against Jackie Poo.

622
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:28,480
But the thing is though is that I don't see, you know of course people are going to complain

623
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,680
about him because he's displayed this utter lack of professionalism in all of his dealings

624
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,760
with everybody.

625
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,880
People have reposted emails where he has just completely gone to name calling and finger

626
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,480
pointing like a freaking schoolyard bully.

627
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,440
That's all he is, an overblown bully.

628
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,840
All he's trying to do is keep his name in the spotlight.

629
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,860
This isn't about helping families.

630
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,380
This isn't about cleaning up America.

631
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:01,240
This is about keeping money in his pocket and the spotlight on him.

632
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,320
One thing though that I guess is a good thing that comes from all this reporting on this

633
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,040
guy is it really does bring the game community together in really interesting ways.

634
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,280
Take that whole pixelante thing, the flowers for Jack, at least there's that good, that

635
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,240
little silver lining that comes out of it as it brings people together out of their

636
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,240
hatred for this guy.

637
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,060
Well, what he needs to also keep in mind that the majority of people who buy video games

638
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,720
are in our age group, the people in this room.

639
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,000
We are the ones who are paying for these games.

640
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,860
you're the ones who are doing a lot of the playing and true yeah a lot of you

641
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,360
know you know teenagers and you know younger kids are playing games but

642
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,680
we're the ones who've been keeping the industry going we were there from the

643
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:47,640
beginning you know you know if he's and like I've brought up before there has

644
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,560
been so much concrete proof to refute everything he's saying and he just

645
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:57,880
refuses to accept the fact as fact I honestly I'm sick of him I'm sick of how

646
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,960
utterly stupid he is. He's proof

647
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,920
that one can have a college education and still be retarded.

648
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,560
You can address those cards and letters to

649
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,480
DarkSakura. Please do. If he emails anybody, email me. I will tell you

650
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,720
exactly what I think about you.

651
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,360
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if anybody wants to comment. Oh yeah, absolutely.

652
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,780
Alright, well guess what? The US isn't the only place where video games are

653
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,640
investigated.

654
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,320
Japan's National Police Agency is currently investigating the effects

655
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,240
playing video games and watching anime has on children.

656
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:39,760
This is being led by a former deputy governor of Tokyo, Yutaka Takahana.

657
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,800
These guys met on April 10th in Tokyo to discuss violent video games and sexual content on

658
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
the internet.

659
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,360
Previously, though, there really hasn't been a whole lot of controversy in Japan regarding

660
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:54,680
the in-game violence, but this current generation of games, of course, Grand Theft Auto and

661
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:00,780
and so on sort of brings us back to the spotlight there.

662
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:05,280
Also it should be pointed out the sale of Grand Theft Auto 3 was actually banned from

663
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:13,460
being sold to anyone under the age of 18 in two separate Japanese prefectures and so on

664
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,520
so they're just doing this study here I guess seeing if maybe they need to be a little more

665
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,920
tighter on this stuff in Japan.

666
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,920
I don't know.

667
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,920
That'll happen.

668
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,440
does it's just warp our sense of what kind of women we can achieve you know

669
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,680
and women you know don't have breasts that are that big at least not that many

670
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:40,600
of them all right and also tentacle rape is not good all this stuff about the

671
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,280
laws and the people that keep talking about this stuff it just makes me angry

672
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,400
I don't know about you guys but I get a little bit angry when I think about this

673
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,480
stuff and so that's why we have a segment here on orange lounge radio

674
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,480
Dedicated to getting a little bit of this angst out of the system out of our system

675
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,400
And it's called the F use of the week. Are you ready to get angsty boys and girls?

676
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,120
more owl

677
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,120
Dark Sakura

678
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,520
F you to whatever that fatigue shit. I had was earlier in the week because it sucked

679
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:26,520
I actually like being able to get out of bed and do stuff, and I hate missing the show,

680
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:32,600
so yeah, just F you to whatever has caused the weird random fatigue I had.

681
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,200
LOKI F you to the metal alcohol that I drank last

682
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,200
night, because that sucked, and F you to certain sites that report certain stories without

683
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:51,200
that report certain stories without citing certain references.

684
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Thank you.

685
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Spike! Do you have any FUs?

686
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,200
FU to cellular phones that don't work.

687
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,200
That would make me angry too.

688
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,200
My FU this week goes to Loki for not singing karaoke last night,

689
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,200
despite how drunk we got him.

690
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,200
You'll have to kill me for this, you big pussy.

691
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Will you sing when you die?

692
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:24,320
die? Maybe. He'll sing when he's dead. Loki! Sing to us a little bit about the Nintendo

693
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:30,480
DS's other news. The DS is getting a TV... No, I said sing! I'm just kidding, go ahead.

694
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:40,040
The DS is getting a TV tuner. A TV tuner the size of an Xbox. No, the TV tuner is ginormous.

695
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:46,720
And yeah, it's not very portable, but if you're interested, it is available.

696
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,060
And apparently, well, I don't know.

697
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:55,840
It's being reported by Famitsu Magazine, they have a picture of it, and it literally is

698
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,400
bigger than a DS.

699
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,080
And we're talking old DS, wow.

700
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,280
And apparently, you know, if it's like any of the other TV tuners out there, probably

701
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,960
doesn't get very good reception.

702
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,840
Alright, so why would anybody want to buy this?

703
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,240
Because people like their TV on the go. I don't know.

704
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,840
Fair enough. Alright, also coming to the DS,

705
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:26,040
Sudoku Gridmaster. Nintendo recently announced that they're going to be putting

706
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,720
this out.

707
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,000
It's gonna have over 400 puzzles and use the DS's touchscreen and handwriting

708
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,800
recognition software.

709
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,480
You'll have practice mode, easy mode, normal, and hard mode.

710
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,400
The game is supposed to come out June 26. What I'm not sure of though is if that

711
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,440
means Japan

712
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,160
or the US. And I'm thinking, come on, another freaking Sudoku game?

713
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,120
I think the only way this game would sell is if they made it look like

714
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,480
Tetris DS. Like put

715
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,220
16-bit Nintendo characters in it. Oh it's Mario presents Sudoku! And then it

716
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,000
would sell

717
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,760
like freaking crazy. What do you want to bet?

718
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,000
Just put Link on it, put Zelda's face on it, do something,

719
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,040
and people will eat that shit up. It's the Legend of Sudoku.

720
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,560
That's the Legend of Sudoku. Dun dun! I'm going to name my firstborn Sudoku.

721
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,740
Why? I'm not. But I am naming my-

722
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,080
when I have a son I'm naming him Richter, after Richter Belmont.

723
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,840
Because you're a geek. Can you pronounce it like the bad English dub?

724
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,600
Richter! Richter! Where you have to wipe out your eye every time you talk to Maria.

725
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,200
Thank you for knowing where I was going with that. Before Doc Sakura coughs up a lung there

726
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:40,760
with uh the uh reactor thing the grudge is like two years old now stop all right although

727
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,320
they do make a reference to the grudge in scary movie 4 which came out on friday yes

728
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:50,200
but i heard it sucks uh loki it was funny i don't know you heard wrong well it's a matter

729
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,920
of everyone's opinion what did it get on the tomato meter that's what i want to know no

730
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,060
i really have no interest in seeing it all right uh loki more ds new mario brothers what's

731
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,480
happening with that yeah they're going to be having some of the mini games in mario

732
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,480
brothers. Very similar to what you saw in Super Mario 64 for the DS. To be honest, I

733
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,920
think I played the minigames more than I actually played the games. But this time around, you'll

734
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,240
actually be able to play the multiplayer, which is pretty sweet. So, some minigame action

735
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:23,800
for you to be shared with friends. That's gonna be fun. Can't wait. It's gonna be fun-tastic.

736
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,120
Fun-tastic. Another friend code for you to have to manage with your friends. That should

737
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,420
be a lot of fun. Well, I don't know if it's over the internet. I don't think it's through

738
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:41,260
their wifi service. I think it's just local. Oh. Lame. Alright. DarkSakura likes to surf

739
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:46,240
the internet up and down researching Dreamcast games, but once in a while she comes on another

740
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,640
website that she wants to share with all of you guys. It's DarkSakura's website of the

741
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,360
week. And where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week, DarkSakura? This

742
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:01,920
This is a site that's had me mesmerized for about 3 hours as a few people online.

743
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,920
Ron was one of them.

744
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,200
Can attest too because I kept linking pictures.

745
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,200
Snopes.com.

746
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,200
S-N-O-P-E-S.com.

747
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,440
It's basically an urban legends reference page.

748
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,440
It's fabulous.

749
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,520
In fact, someone on my... and I knew about this site for a while, but someone actually

750
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,460
linked a picture of the world's largest rabbit, who was like as big as a dog.

751
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:28,260
a golden retriever and and it's real and there's lots of interesting pictures in

752
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:35,700
here like the Cyclops cat and a twin well a two-headed baby it actually was

753
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,340
like a head and half of a body attached to her head they actually had the other

754
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:45,380
twin removed but yeah I mean some of this is you know there's the fake ones

755
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,620
on here it's basically any urban legend that's been reported and they investigate

756
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,620
it and let you know if it's real or not I love this site because I get those

757
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:57,220
crappy forwards from co-workers all the time of these totally untrue things and

758
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,780
what I'll do is I'll go on to Snopes.com and find the little article and I'll

759
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:06,900
just copy paste the link in an email back and I always reply to all. Good but

760
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:15,500
I'm just for a little overview the hottest 25 urban legends as of this week

761
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:21,540
is there's one about gas there's the giant rabbit one about Bill Gates doing

762
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:26,460
Microsoft and AOL giveaway and about the brown recluse spider the effects of the

763
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:31,880
brown recluse all right so check it out it should be required reading for

764
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,060
anybody who wants to send a forward email and for the for the sake of the

765
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,760
chat room I am going to link the giant rabbit story all right there you go

766
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,080
otherwise you'll have to beg for it in the forums I forgot to mention when

767
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:48,420
we're talking about useless games and stuff that's coming out this week brain

768
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:53,840
Age is actually coming out this week. Oh, is it? Yeah. Oh, I told it's this week. I believe so cool

769
00:47:54,500 --> 00:48:00,120
Well so much for useless games coming. I really want that one. It's still not a game. I want to check it out anyway

770
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,880
One game I've always been meaning to check out that I seem to never get around to is Civilization 4

771
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,100
Well, there's actually a past see what I'm waiting for is I'm waiting for like the ultimate Civ 4

772
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,540
Compilation to come out for 20 bucks in like a year because that's what always happens with civilization games

773
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:19,340
But anyway, if you're a rabid Civilization fan who's getting your fix right now, there's

774
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:23,680
a brand new patch that just came out, and it's circulating on the internet.

775
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,080
And part of it is just a patch to up your game to 1.61, you know, bug fixes, tweaks,

776
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,080
all that fun stuff.

777
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,800
However, the other part of this is very cool.

778
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,900
It's a software development kit, and what it'll do is it'll let programmers basically

779
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,620
mess with the inner functions and make user-created mods.

780
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:46,100
So I think that's very cool is that Civ 4 is really embracing the mod community.

781
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,820
And I remember them saying they were going to do this when the game first launched but

782
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,500
they're really putting it out there where anybody can make their own Civ 4 scenarios.

783
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,040
I think that's very cool.

784
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,540
And I know we've had folks email us in the past wanting to know more about these types

785
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,540
of games that you can mod and all that good stuff.

786
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:03,640
So this is a good one right here, Civilization 4, make your own scenarios.

787
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,100
It is down to $30 if you want to pick up the game, down from I think $50 when it first

788
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,100
came out.

789
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:15,660
$9.99, or as I call it, $30.

790
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,660
Moving on.

791
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,660
Loki!

792
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,660
Yes.

793
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,340
What's making a comeback?

794
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:24,220
Hopefully not a wee bull, but, Alone in the Dark.

795
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,260
I mean, I remember they were showing some pictures of Alone in the Dark, the new one,

796
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,540
and they're actually kind of pretty cool and they have some screenshots up right now.

797
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:36,340
But 1UP is reporting that Alone in the Dark will rear its head on next-gen consoles very

798
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,340
soon.

799
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:42,940
probably will see at E3, maybe. But we'll have to wait, they're going to be showing

800
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:49,940
it in I think the next electronic gaming monthly. So, should be interesting.

801
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,380
Are you Alone in the Dark? Yes, and I'm playing a crappy video game called Alone in the Dark.

802
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,980
If I remember correctly, I did read a little bit about this.

803
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,220
Just teasing, I'm teasing, I'm teasing. It's actually supposed to be set in Central

804
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:09,020
Park in New York and something about um I don't remember now but um some

805
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:16,500

807
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:28,780
one more major story for you guys tonight that comes from dark soccer then

808
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,980
We're going to open up our Skype line over at www.orangelonitrader.com, click on interact

809
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:33,980
with us.

810
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,400
But Arch Soccer has a little bit of a follow-up.

811
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,140
We talked about this title, I think, previously, but now we've got a little more news on it.

812
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:46,180
There's actually Guitar Man on the PSP.

813
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:52,020
Basically there is a, on the Japanese Playstation site, there is a product posting announcing

814
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:57,260
a second Guitar Man, of course, published by Koei.

815
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,800
Koei gave us Keio Flying Squadron, I like them.

816
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,100
Um, but as Guitar Man Live for the PSP,

817
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,780
um, follow up to the first Guitar Man that was on PlayStation 2,

818
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:12,620
um, there's supposed to- there's speculation that there's gonna be demos at E3.

819
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:15,820
Hopefully, that will be true. I will be

820
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,900
living at wherever that is. Um,

821
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,060
but, uh, the, uh,

822
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:28,220
There's very few details out on it right now, although there's a new feature that's being advertised

823
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,940
That has network play

824
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:36,860
But not online compatible and you can compete head-to-head or cooperative in duet mode

825
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:46,080
It's supposed to be a bit more balanced the music and vocals are provided by actual Japanese pop stars, so

826
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:50,200
Maybe it'll be someone that we've heard of over here.

827
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,840
It'll be cool, I think it's going to be pretty cool. I'm looking forward to it.

828
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:59,080
Alright, sounds good. Our skype line is open over at www.orangelaunchradio.com

829
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,480
Click on interact with us

830
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,320
so let's pick up some calls. Hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

831
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,160
Sweet, I'm the first one on, it's Ranma. Hi Ranma, what's on your mind?

832
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,480
Not much, I want to cover a couple of things and I'm on my way out of here.

833
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:28,120
I want to talk about the Xbox emulator and I can explain better why it was taking it

834
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:32,160
so long to convert games and make them more compatible and stuff.

835
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,200
Oh yeah, what is up with that?

836
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,760
On the 360, very few games are compatible.

837
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,760
What's up with that?

838
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,260
You know, from my knowledge, working with computers and technology, it's like this.

839
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,660
Xbox is Pentium 3, and Xbox 360 is like a core cell processor or something like that.

840
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,060
Basically, the emulator has to convert the coding and stuff, so it'll work.

841
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,660
As for the graphics processor, that part really doesn't matter per se,

842
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,060
because even though it's optimized for NVIDIA,

843
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:05,960
it's still like a generic graphics, it'll still work on the quote-unquote new ATI graphics chipset or whatever.

844
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,260
It's not optimized for NVIDIA, it's built by NVIDIA.

845
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,780
it's a little different but it'll still work regardless even on those games they're

846
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,860
saying they'll work

847
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,940
on that chipset it'll work on others as well

848
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:24,940
I still think it's fucked that you can play Barbie and not DDR I mean fuck that

849
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:29,700
I agree I mean I understand why because you know they get one game to work and

850
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,280
usually about 10 games are very similar to that but still

851
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,060
it's messed up it's wrong it's wrong

852
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,740
Know I know

853
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:44,300
All right, anything else Rana? How goes your training against Jack Thompson? I got 51 odds on you to kick his ass. Oh

854
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:49,520
No, he's kind of old and broken. Yeah, we wouldn't we won't get win in a fight now

855
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,320
We wouldn't know we don't want to get sued over, you know threatening to fight him or whatever

856
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,860
It's not a threaten to fight

857
00:53:54,860 --> 00:54:01,780
I'm just speculating that if there was if I had to defend myself if a rabid Jack Thompson came to Sacramento

858
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:07,920
Sacramento and wanted to beat me up or give me rabies then I would win in a fight. He's coming right for us. Ah

859
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,100
Jamie you didn't hear last week's um

860
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:17,740
Show did you I was sort of dead. Well, I basically told Jack to bring it on. That's all yes

861
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:21,380
I called Jack out. I said I said bring it bitch. I said bring it

862
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:25,340
We would own him so I know I know physically I said we could have a war of words

863
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:29,920
I said I would be cordial to him and let him have his say but then he would have to listen to everything I have

864
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,440
to say in return you know what though that wouldn't be fair because well we

865
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:40,160
would just completely decimate him I know you cannot have a battle of wits

866
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:45,040
against an unarmed opponent point taken all right Rama we got to get some more

867
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,360
calls but thank you so much for the call no problem love it love you guys bye

868
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,880
some folks in the chat room are asking did we SSJ 100 Matt wants to know did we

869
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,620
do peep jousting this year that's actually something that happened on the

870
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,620
old show vanilla sky my one of my spin-off shows we did not do peep

871
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:04,380
jousting this morning and for those that don't know what peep jousting is that is

872
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,980
when you on Easter actually you can do this any day take some marshmallow peeps

873
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:12,260
but it's easiest around Easter take some marshmallow peeps and stick some

874
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,260
toothpicks in them and then put them in the microwave and watch them get really

875
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,700
really really big and then at one point one peep has to slaughter the other

876
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:25,300
mercifully no word with the toothpick and it's beautiful to watch because

877
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,020
those things get huge and then you eat them if you're feeling the best part is

878
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:33,280
after incredibly nasty slightly after Easter going and buying the old peeps

879
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,400
that no one wants you get like packages of those that's what I need to do

880
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,000
tomorrow I need to go to Target and for friggin day oh my god I get such good

881
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,240
candy deals at Target I mean I'm I'm gaining weight and everything so I

882
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:47,800
probably shouldn't but Oh peeps peeps are so good marshmallows are so gross

883
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:52,480
they're like diabetes waiting to happen I think we should have a gang of peeps

884
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,560
versus a gang of circus peanuts and we'll see who wins the nuts or the

885
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:02,040
grand theft candy coming to an orange lounge near you can we go to another

886
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,200
call please beat it in the background while you make this that might be fun

887
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:11,200
let's go to another call hi you're on orange lounge radio hey hi who's this

888
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,960
this is did you lose a sock did you lose a sock welcome to orange lounge radio I

889
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:21,360
don't recognize that name it's very cool a longtime podcast listener first time

890
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:27,560
listening live. Very cool, well welcome. Welcome to the madness. Thank you, appreciate it.

891
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:33,840
I just wanted to call in and say awesome show, loved it, and that I think it's stupid that

892
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:42,080
people think Mac gaming is going to die. That Mac gaming is going to die? Oh because of

893
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:46,920
the whole dual booth thing? Yeah I think people are stupid thinking that it will die, I don't

894
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,540
think it will

895
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:52,240
I don't think it will you know what Commodore 64 gaming is still not dead in

896
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,680
many ways so

897
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,600
Mac gaming will never die either you know there's there's rabid fans for

898
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,320
everything and

899
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,720
I don't think the dual boot thing is gonna take off right away

900
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:05,000
it's gonna be a little while I think there's still be some good stuff on Mac

901
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,280
yeah with the with the switch to the Intel processor

902
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,320
I think actually porting games will make it a lot easier so

903
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,720
I think we're gonna see more games on the Mac

904
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,840
Very, uh, we'll see what happens.

905
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,200
I hope so. Alright, anything else? Mr. Sock?

906
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,000
Oh, keep up the good work. Alright. Thank you very much. We appreciate the ego boost call

907
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,640
once in a while.

908
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,000
Okay. Alright, have a good one. We like new people.

909
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,920
Love it when new people call in the show. Alright, let's go to another call here.

910
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,240
We'll go over

911
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,320
here. Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Hey, what's up?

912
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:46,640
Hi, who's this? Uh, this is Hitstun. Hi, Hitstun. What's on your mind?

913
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,920
mine hello um yeah I got a couple things I want to go over here okay I want to

914
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:58,880
throw out idea I noticed earlier today about well earlier this week about how

915
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,940
Walmart dictates the contents of games like I posted this up well I saw was

916
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:12,400
posted on the forums too but like they can dictate things like I know it's cool

917
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,400
I know what article you're talking about and for some reason yeah yeah for some

918
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,640
reason it didn't make this week's show roll but I do remember reading something

919
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,880
on it like Walmart is when a double-a title comes out Walmart supposedly gets

920
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,440
to review the title before it's released yeah I you know why I don't I think one

921
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,800
reason we kind of didn't originally intend on covering it is because I don't

922
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:39,760
know if I believe it um well I can explain okay go for it it's like they

923
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,120
only have so much shelf space like they only have room for so many adventure

924
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,600
games, so many RPGs, so many strategy games, whatever.

925
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,400
And if something isn't popular enough,

926
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,800
they're not going to have the room to carry it.

927
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,640
So I had an idea.

928
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,640
There should be an independent publisher that's

929
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,600
like Cafe Press.

930
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,560
You know how Cafe Press does like t-shirts and coffee

931
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,400
mugs and stuff, or whoever.

932
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:00,920
Right.

933
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,040
You send them a design and they make it.

934
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,400
Someone should do that for video games.

935
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,720
That's my idea.

936
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,400
Stamp your video game on a 360?

937
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,120
Yeah, exactly.

938
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,040
Anyone who wants to publish their game

939
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:16,200
should be able to send it to this company and have people order it from this site and

940
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,200
get copies of it.

941
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,200
I think I blowed this whole thing wide open.

942
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,760
Look, people out there wanting to start a business, you need to give Hitstun a call.

943
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,600
He's got a good idea here.

944
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:30,720
Now I'm hoping, here's the problem though, would these games break after I put them through

945
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,920
the wash one time?

946
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,480
Because that's what happens to all that shit I buy from Cafe E-Press, is they fucking break

947
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,000
one time after the wash.

948
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Touche.

949
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,880
I don't know about that, Vee.

950
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:44,720
I still have a copy of that Bimani t-shirt. You must hand wash that baby or listen

951
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:53,100
Here is why Walmart knew how they dictate games. Okay, so you have this game coming out called. Halo 3

952
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:56,520
Yeah, does it have hunting deer in it?

953
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,960
It doesn't we don't want to carry it. I

954
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,520
Don't buy music at Walmart because I don't agree with this

955
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:11,360
I just I really don't shop at Walmart in general because I'm such a target whore for one and I just think Walmart is nasty

956
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,040
I mean, I don't know about the Walmart's in your neck of the woods, but around here. They're nasty

957
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:21,280
You walk in and it smells like dirt. I mean you live in Alabama Walmart's the primary source of entertainment. I

958
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:27,400
Know I understand I understand that in some areas Walmart's only option. I'm not joking, but you guys have online

959
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,840
Yeah, it's a nice independent stores here. All right. Well, that's good. Like here to call this area and one more thing

960
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:39,120
Hmm, I I need to pwn you guys a Tetris DS any of you with Tetris DS

All right. Thank you guys so much for calling in on the Skype line tonight

973
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:33,700
last minute story they'd like to share?

974
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:38,400
Yeah, Project Gotham 3 is getting an update on Xbox Live.

975
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,540
Basic stuff that they're going to be adding, one of them is

976
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:48,560
the ability to lock the host car and host car class.

977
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:53,220
So again, just what kind of car class you're racing as. Also,

978
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:56,440
added wheel support for some of these brand new

979
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,600
steer wheels out there being put out by like uh... mad cats and

980
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,040
and stuff like that uh... also

981
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,240
finally

982
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,920
uh... they're going to be doing

983
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,280

984
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,880

01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,800

hey how about a game of you know uh... credit auto right now michael fucking

01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,020

1000
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,120
even if i have drunk

1001
01:02:54,120 --> 01:03:00,120
There were 5,400 World of Warcraft players banned.

1002
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,120
Oh my gosh, what did they do?

1003
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:06,120
Basically, they were trying to clamp down on gold farming and cheating.

1004
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,120
And funeral party raiding.

1005
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:16,120
10,700 accounts were suspended for participating in activities that violate the game's terms of use,

1006
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:20,120
including using third-party programs to farm gold and items.

1007
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,680
According to Blizzard, and I quote, such actions can severely impact the economy of a realm

1008
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,520
and the overall game enjoyment for all players.

1009
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,920
And selling World of Warcraft content such as gold items and characters can result in

1010
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,920
permanent ban of the involved accounts.

1011
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,160
If you want to cheat like that, you better go play Oblivion.

1012
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:41,900
However, a new patch, 1.10.1, is released.

1013
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:46,760
The Jagged Obsidian Shield is now bind on equipped, and the Titanic Leggings pattern

1014
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,480
and will now drop slightly less frequently,

1015
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,680
which is obviously, you know,

1016
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,240
it's gonna make, you know, the item a bit more.

1017
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,120
You know the amazing Extrofer hit 60

1018
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,920
on his character on World of Warcraft this week.

1019
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,200
Dear God, I'm still level seven.

1020
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,520
I haven't even reviewed my account.

1021
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,080
And I was like, what are you gonna do now?

1022
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,440
And he's like, I'm gonna go on raids,

1023
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,200
and I'm gonna do all this fun stuff with my character

1024
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,440
that they wouldn't let me do before,

1025
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,460
because I wasn't 60, and I come in the next day,

1026
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:11,960
and I notice there's an experience bar

1027
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:12,800
at the bottom of the screen.

1028
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,000
I'm like, you're not playing your character.

1029
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:22,300
like yeah I got bored so I'm leveling my alt a little bit more news 1.11 is

1030
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:27,860
coming out soon which is basically made specific there'll be a talent review

1031
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:36,100
patch is going to introduce a new 40 man raid dungeon the necropolis of Naxxramas

1032
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:42,500
and which is home to the dreaded lich unpronounceable name insert here all

1033
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:50,500
There's also a little bit more. Capcom's gonna be loading us with stuff at E3 and you know what, I hate Firefox all of a sudden.

1034
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,500
What, did it do a crash on you?

1035
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,500
Yes!

1036
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,500
Oh no!

1037
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,500
So let's see if I can get around this.

1038
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,500
I can do a story-

1039
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,500
Just go ahead and leave it off of there.

1040
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,500
Alright, I can do a fill in real quick if you get to bring it up.

1041
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,500
Nah, I'm not even gonna bother with it.

1042
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,500
Alright.

1043
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:09,500
Go Nintendo has an interesting little quote from Ubisoft Montreal CEO's Yanis Mallet.

1044
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:16,540
I can say definitely as any other developer. We are looking at this magical platform, and we want to be a part of the adventure

1045
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:20,740
I'm pretty sure we'll see other revolution games from Ubisoft and some of them

1046
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:25,160
I'm sure will be made from Montreal, so he's quoting there that the revolution is a

1047
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:28,180
magical platform, it's full of

1048
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,660
Magic and they're going to make magic games

1049
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:38,360
She can play as fairies and magic!

1050
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,360
Can I get a puppy?

1051
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:49,160
You can do anything on the magic of Nintendo!

1052
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:50,240
That's it.

1053
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,040
That's pretty much going to do it for tonight's show.

1054
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,240
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1055
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,440
Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?

1056
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,620
I want a rabbit that's as big as a dog.

1057
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:04,020
My final thought is, I want a dog that's as big as a rabbit.

1058
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:05,020
Spike.

1059
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:06,660
Die, monster.

1060
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:09,180
You don't belong in this world.

1061
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:10,180
And...

1062
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:14,860
It was not by my hand that I was given flesh.

1063
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:15,860
Nerds!

1064
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:16,860
Nerds!

1065
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:17,860
Loki.

1066
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:18,860
Um...

1067
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:19,860
Well...

1068
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,860
Ooh, video.

1069
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:23,860
We'll have to...

1070
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,060
I'm really trying to get this on the website.

1071
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:27,060
Alright.

1072
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,980
You do that, Mr. Loki.

1073
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:32,820
Alright, that's going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

1074
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:37,700
Thank you guys so much for downloading us, checking us out, tuning in live, breaking

1075
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,740
some record numbers for us listening live tonight.

1076
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:42,060
I really, really appreciate that you guys.

1077
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:46,860
Again, all we ask if you enjoy the show, we do it for free, just tell a friend, tell somebody

1078
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:50,700
you know about Orange Lounge Radio because that's really the best way for us to advertise

1079
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:56,460
because we don't have any big sites backing us and we don't have those ads and things

1080
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:00,580
so unless Loki can manage to leak some more release dates we don't get

1081
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:03,420
attention very often so we need you guys to help us out

1082
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:07,780
Dark Sakura? I almost forgot reject false icons

1083
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:10,820

1084
