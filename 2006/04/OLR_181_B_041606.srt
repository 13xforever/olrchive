2
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:20,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:46,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Deja Vu

4
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XI Game Boy Advance Space Channel 5

5
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:41,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought along Vib Ribbon, of course, for the PS1.

6
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:41,697
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a classic.

7
00:01:41,757 --> 00:01:43,517
[SPEAKER_09]: That I've seen before, but it is a classic.

8
00:01:43,997 --> 00:01:47,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a pretty common one, but on the off chance.

9
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:51,938
[SPEAKER_06]: The main one that I was excited to bring to you was Primal Image, which we talked about last week.

10
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:52,238
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

11
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Primal Image was the Pokemon Snap with supermodels, right?

12
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:57,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, except I played it again.

13
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:59,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they don't really look like supermodels.

14
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Just people.

15
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Supermarket models.

16
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Superwhores.

17
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

18
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,361
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

19
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:06,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds awesome.

20
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:14,594
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, one system that has gotten a lot of attention lately with all the things you can do with it is the Nintendo DS.

21
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:19,496
[SPEAKER_09]: And we thought we'd start this segment of the show off with some hacking news.

22
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, what's going on with Nintendo DS, hack-wise?

23
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:27,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hack-wise, you know, they've done some really cool things.

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Like at E3 last year, they had this thing called the DS Download Station.

25
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:37,084
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can actually download demos of games to your DS.

26
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:40,501
[SPEAKER_07]: And these have actually started to roll out into stores now.

27
00:02:41,342 --> 00:02:47,627
[SPEAKER_07]: And you might see them at a local Best Buy or that type of thing.

28
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:52,691
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing is, if you don't have one nearby, what are you to do?

29
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:53,691
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you to do?

30
00:02:54,372 --> 00:02:55,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, build your own.

31
00:02:57,174 --> 00:02:57,714
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

32
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:04,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, plans were put up on the internet on how to build your own DS station.

33
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,881
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have the files out there to do it.

34
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:09,192
[SPEAKER_07]: A whole tutorial.

35
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:09,912
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty simple.

36
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:16,034
[SPEAKER_07]: You just basically need to get an RT2500 based Wi-Fi card in your computer.

37
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:22,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Or sometimes your laptop will have one too because you can do the PCMI card.

38
00:03:23,877 --> 00:03:24,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I do it on my Apple?

39
00:03:26,198 --> 00:03:27,278
[SPEAKER_07]: You might be able to.

40
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:27,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

41
00:03:27,898 --> 00:03:28,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try it.

42
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

43
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,541
[SPEAKER_07]: But they have a whole list of stuff that's available to basically do this.

44
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:36,021
[SPEAKER_07]: And

45
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:43,409
[SPEAKER_07]: All the demos that they have on here, which I'm sure I don't know how they got the demos off the demo station, but they're all the ones that are currently out there now.

46
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Brain training and all that fun stuff.

47
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,312
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you really want to do it, I wanted to get this done on my laptop so we could actually do it in the studio.

48
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:56,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe for next week, but... Isn't it just a matter of time before they figure out a way to beam the games over?

49
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:58,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just the demo, but possibly the whole freaking games?

50
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:01,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if they can store that much on there.

51
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:02,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, okay.

52
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,837
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, you know...

53
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:05,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

54
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:15,059
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently, though, if you do have a Game Boy Advance flash cart, you can record the games to that, and there's a way around where you can actually play them off of that, too.

55
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:17,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo's probably a little irked at this news.

56
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:19,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably, yeah.

57
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:25,883
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, for those folks who maybe live in a remote part, or maybe, you know, I think what would be very interesting is using this in other countries.

58
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:39,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I think some folks who are in other countries like Japan, the UK, who might not be seeing these games for a little while otherwise, and even the demos, can play these long before they're released in those, well, not Japan so much, maybe the UK, released in that country.

59
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:41,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that's pretty cool.

60
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:49,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the other thing is maybe modify it to put Homebrew on there to play Homebrew games that you can transfer via Wi-Fi without having to have all this fancy stuff.

61
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,884
[SPEAKER_09]: GamerDude1212 says, Nintendo hates all this piracy stuff.

62
00:04:59,064 --> 00:04:59,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't doubt it.

63
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,226
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't doubt it at all.

64
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:01,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure they do.

65
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:03,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Most companies do hate it.

66
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,092
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably not going to be an issue later because think about it.

67
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:14,837
[SPEAKER_07]: The virtual console, the fact that the Revolution is going to have Wi-Fi, the fact that it's going to be able to hook up to the DS...

68
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:20,889
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll probably be able to download these for free off of the DS, or the Revolution anyways, so what's the big deal?

69
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:26,010
[SPEAKER_09]: How cool would that be anyway to, you know, go to Nintendo.com and download something that you can beam?

70
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:35,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Forget this whole store, you know, why not bypass the kiosks and stores and be able to download demos to your DS just like you can on Xbox Live, but you do it through your computer?

71
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:38,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they should be endorsing this stuff, not turning their back on it.

72
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:40,215
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah, whatever.

73
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:41,495
[SPEAKER_09]: What do I know?

74
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:48,733
[SPEAKER_09]: I do know this, Xbox Live is going to be doing another free week, but it's during the week of E3.

75
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:54,617
[SPEAKER_09]: This time it's not just, I don't think it's just one weekend, I think it's actually doing a whole week, no I'm sorry, it is just one weekend.

76
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,399
[SPEAKER_09]: But the weekend that they're going to be doing this is May 8th.

77
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,861
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it is a full week, it's because it's running through May 15th.

78
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:09,627
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going to be sponsored by, well I'm not sure, I thought I saw the name of the sponsor there.

79
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:19,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought, um, not FIFA, um... Well, FIFA World Cup Soccer 2006 might hit the marketplace during that same week.

80
00:06:19,582 --> 00:06:24,844
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't FIFA, it was a shoe brand that was, um, doing it.

81
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:25,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

82
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:27,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see if I can find it here.

83
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:29,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Adidas.

84
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Adidas, that's it.

85
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:30,667
[SPEAKER_09]: They were doing it.

86
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:31,987
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew I could find it, yay!

87
00:06:32,947 --> 00:06:36,169
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Adidas, all day I dream about.

88
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:40,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, my mind just can't help but go there.

89
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:43,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Good idea, bad idea to do this during the week of E3.

90
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:51,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Because most of the hardcore gamers will be either at E3 or glued to their computers reading updates on E3.

91
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:53,692
[SPEAKER_07]: So is this a smart thing to do?

92
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now you can go play a demo of it on Xbox Live Arcade.

93
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:03,247
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be very cool.

94
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:04,348
[SPEAKER_09]: You think they would actually do that?

95
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:06,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Play the demos that they're playing at E3?

96
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:07,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Download them right now?

97
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,090
[SPEAKER_07]: No way.

98
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

99
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they just don't do that.

100
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:11,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe limited ones.

101
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:17,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, but is there anything so wrong with putting those demos out there on Xbox Live for everybody to play?

102
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:20,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it just because the games are usually half finished or what?

103
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,604
[SPEAKER_02]: There is actually one out on Xbox Live now, the Tomb Raider one.

104
00:07:24,804 --> 00:07:27,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, well they have several of those demos.

105
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:38,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be a good idea, but not like, have it be like a specific download, like you have a certain amount of points, you can download it, something like that.

106
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:41,398
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, how cool would that be?

107
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:44,481
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the closest you can get to E3, you know?

108
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:45,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Right here in your living room.

109
00:07:45,722 --> 00:07:47,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Play the same demo they're all playing at E3 right now.

110
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:49,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be great publicity stunt.

111
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:57,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially since, bless their hearts, they decided to not give everybody who works for anyone who sells video games passes.

112
00:07:58,414 --> 00:08:02,238
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it is going to reduce the amount of

113
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:15,372
[SPEAKER_03]: People who are going to be able to go to E3 Somehow this no-name site got in though, which is amazing We actually report I know, we're a legitimate business, believe it or not We don't work in the garden section at Walmart Exactly

114
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:25,837
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that I could see turning a lot of prospective developers away from that, though, is that the average E3 demo is nowhere near as polished as a demo you might get on a demo disc.

115
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:34,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people who are casually downloading off the marketplace might be using this as, you know, is this my final decision on purchasing this game?

116
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,280
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would definitely scare a lot of people away.

117
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,881
[SPEAKER_06]: You play a demo of an unfinished game, it's not very good.

118
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:44,302
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't come back to it six months later when it's really ready to be played.

119
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:44,822
[SPEAKER_09]: E3 Demo

120
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:06,900
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

121
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:28,709
[SPEAKER_06]: That would target them and make them feel like they're a part of something.

122
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:34,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of gamers would really go for, oh, this developer is targeting me, I want to play this.

123
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:36,453
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, we need to start an Xbox development company.

124
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:37,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now.

125
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,214
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a better idea.

126
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:41,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Green Lounge Gaming.

127
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:42,735
[SPEAKER_07]: How about this?

128
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:43,255
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

129
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:46,497
[SPEAKER_07]: How about we sell 360 games with hamburgers?

130
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:47,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, I love this idea.

131
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:49,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I love this idea.

132
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:51,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Can any of us cook?

133
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, how about this?

134
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:52,716
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, I got it.

135
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:53,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

136
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:56,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox Live with Super Bacon.

137
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my stomach has just turned really awfully now.

138
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:02,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel nauseous.

139
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:06,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel nauseous too, but now I want Super Bacon.

140
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:08,104
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyway, moving on.

141
00:10:09,244 --> 00:10:13,507
[SPEAKER_09]: One Xbox Live, or one Xbox title, I should say, in general has been turning heads is Oblivion.

142
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:14,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, Loki?

143
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:20,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Oblivion has been turning heads, and it's been selling and selling and selling and

144
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say 2.5 million.

145
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:23,954
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot of copies.

146
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:25,274
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of copies.

147
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:27,354
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I think selling these?

148
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:28,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Nude Patch?

149
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:29,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.

150
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:31,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that all there is to say?

151
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:32,795
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just sold a lot?

152
00:10:33,695 --> 00:10:35,275
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not at all.

153
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:37,276
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just bullshitting.

154
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:42,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, it's gotten really good scores out of a lot of the magazines that reviewed it.

155
00:10:43,537 --> 00:10:48,898
[SPEAKER_07]: They've sold over 1.7 million units of Oblivion for the PC and the 360...

156
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:53,124
[SPEAKER_07]: since they've shipped from launch.

157
00:10:53,664 --> 00:10:56,586
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been on the covers of magazines.

158
00:10:57,306 --> 00:10:58,707
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just really good.

159
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:00,989
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ended world hunger.

160
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,071
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically accounted for approximately... It found Osama Bin Laden.

161
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:05,731
[SPEAKER_09]: It's amazing.

162
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:11,195
[SPEAKER_07]: It accounted for 13% of all PC game sales in the first week since it was released.

163
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:15,377
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the way, the other 87% was World of Warcraft, amazingly.

164
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:16,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Go figure.

165
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:19,960
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I want to know?

166
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Where the hell is my free feel?

167
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:23,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

168
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:48,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we should do all of our games in Commodore 64 Basic because I know how to program in Commodore 64 Basic.

169
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:51,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a way we... Oh, Spike's doing this.

170
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:51,852
[SPEAKER_09]: You, me, you.

171
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:52,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

172
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:58,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's program some games in Commodore 64 Basic and somehow find somebody to port them to the Xbox 360.

173
00:11:58,554 --> 00:12:00,155
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be awesome.

174
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:02,916
[SPEAKER_06]: You have banana.

175
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:03,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Throw?

176
00:12:04,176 --> 00:12:04,696
[SPEAKER_06]: YN?

177
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:05,637
[SPEAKER_06]: You have bacon.

178
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:05,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat?

179
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:06,957
[SPEAKER_09]: YN?

180
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:11,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Syntax Error.

181
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:12,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Ready.

182
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:24,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Xbox Live, Saints Row is going to be having a very large demo going to the Xbox Live Marketplace.

183
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:25,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Grand Theft Auto, The Saints Row

184
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:43,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

185
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:47,857
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kinda... It was supposed to be the Grand Theft Auto killer that never freaking came out.

186
00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:48,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha.

187
00:12:48,298 --> 00:12:54,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's on its way, and it's supposedly gonna have multiplayer, so there's supposed to be a very large demo coming to Xbox Live.

188
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:56,183
[SPEAKER_09]: They just don't say when, just sometime before release.

189
00:12:56,203 --> 00:12:56,724
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I say?

190
00:12:56,744 --> 00:12:58,045
[SPEAKER_07]: To hell with the Saints Row.

191
00:12:58,065 --> 00:12:59,225
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about Crackdown.

192
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Crackdown is gonna be awesome.

193
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:06,270
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've gotten this month's official Xbox magazine, they have a trailer for Crackdown.

194
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:06,831
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like...

195
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:12,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto with basically a superhuman as the lead in it so you can throw cars at people.

196
00:13:13,483 --> 00:13:17,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing says, give me my money, bitch, than throwing a fucking car into your head.

197
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:21,590
[SPEAKER_06]: That takes me back to Narc.

198
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:25,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

199
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:28,660
[SPEAKER_09]: The chat room is still talking about this game thing.

200
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,364
[SPEAKER_09]: You know that we did have somebody make Orange Launch Radio the game already.

201
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:33,245
[SPEAKER_09]: That was Illusion.

202
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:35,127
[SPEAKER_09]: One of our fans actually made that, and it's in the forums.

203
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:37,449
[SPEAKER_09]: But now people want to take this to the next level.

204
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:41,273
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ PooEater says that he knows the Flash programming.

205
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:42,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I know DarkSakura knows that too.

206
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:44,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we could have them team up.

207
00:13:44,636 --> 00:13:45,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how to do ads.

208
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:47,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, but not the programming.

209
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know how to do slideshows.

210
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:50,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe you could do the art and he could do the programming.

211
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:51,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm halfway through my flash semester.

212
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,201
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make an awesome opening cinema.

213
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:55,241
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

214
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:56,782
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

215
00:13:57,282 --> 00:13:58,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I love this idea.

216
00:13:58,042 --> 00:13:59,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I do it for my homework?

217
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:00,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

218
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,324
[SPEAKER_03]: If I get school credit for it, okay.

219
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:06,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Check that out on the forums.

220
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,482
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Illusion still has that up.

221
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:11,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm supposed to put it on our MySpace or our website as well, though.

222
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:12,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally forgot.

223
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:16,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot to send them a private message saying we can move it and suck our own bandwidth away.

224
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:19,126
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fabulous.

225
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:20,507
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a text adventure.

226
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,668
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the most fun you'll ever have playing Orange Lounge Radio the game.

227
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,629
[SPEAKER_09]: You had me at text adventure.

228
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:27,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm invincible.

229
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:32,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I type in an attack, nothing would happen.

230
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:33,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Spoiler alert!

231
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:36,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, spoilers.

232
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:40,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe you ruined the Orange Lounge radio game for everybody.

233
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:41,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say what happened.

234
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:42,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said I'm invincible.

235
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,730
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what happens on page 290?

236
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie kills Dumbledore.

237
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:48,731
[SPEAKER_09]: It's amazing.

238
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:50,512
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a spoiler.

239
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:52,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say what happens in the game.

240
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:53,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said I'm invincible.

241
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:55,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

242
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:56,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Aerith died.

243
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:57,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And I cheered.

244
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:01,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have my memory card saved.

245
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:03,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you've told this story five times on the show.

246
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:07,454
[SPEAKER_03]: More than that, but I still think that... It's like one of her crowning moments.

247
00:15:07,794 --> 00:15:09,295
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something I'm very proud of.

248
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:11,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have my file.

249
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:14,318
[SPEAKER_09]: You should sell that card on eBay, that memory card.

250
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell no!

251
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie's saved game at Dead Aerith.

252
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,882
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, this memory card is special.

253
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:20,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd buy it.

254
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:22,803
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my first memory card I ever had.

255
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:24,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an off-brand one.

256
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:25,805
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a Sakura sticker on it.

257
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:34,339
[SPEAKER_03]: and it has all of my old Tekken 3 save files and bus to move.

258
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,062
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that memory card is special to me.

259
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:40,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and my Symphony of the Night files with 210%.

260
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:40,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Dork.

261
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:41,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

262
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:50,795
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura likes to travel the world from her computer because she has buddies over in the UK and she doesn't want them to feel left out.

263
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:55,456
[SPEAKER_09]: So she serves some of the UK news sites to find out what's going on in gaming in the UK.

264
00:15:55,736 --> 00:15:56,656
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on in gaming.

265
00:15:56,816 --> 00:16:00,357
[SPEAKER_09]: But of course, you know, what goes on over there often affects what happens over here.

266
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:03,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't like to think of it as necessarily UK only news.

267
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:05,578
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just news from the UK.

268
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:06,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice disclaimer.

269
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:07,718
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

270
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:11,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I find I have to use them quite frequently with you.

271
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

272
00:16:14,386 --> 00:16:14,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

273
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:15,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart.

274
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:16,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

275
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:19,547
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to just be nice to me because I hurt.

276
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:20,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart?

277
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:21,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make heart signs at me.

278
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:24,028
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not going to make me... It's the OLR gang sign.

279
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:24,568
[SPEAKER_09]: A little heart.

280
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:27,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this should be the official OLR gang sign.

281
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:28,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Make a heart with your hands.

282
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:31,609
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't know how to do it, we'll take a picture.

283
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:32,469
[SPEAKER_09]: You're retarded then.

284
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:33,689
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a picture... Shut up!

285
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,730
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a picture of you.

286
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:36,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Doing that?

287
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing hearts.

288
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.

289
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,650
[SPEAKER_03]: From the club.

290
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:39,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.

291
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put it up online.

292
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,671
[SPEAKER_03]: You also look really silly in that picture too.

293
00:16:42,731 --> 00:16:43,111
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't use...

294
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,802
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm going to do Brazil News now.

295
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:52,907
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Polish developer called Nibris, I guess is how it's pronounced.

296
00:16:53,207 --> 00:17:01,534
[SPEAKER_03]: They're working on a film noir inspired game for the revolution called Sadness, which I automatically want to play it because it's very emo and goth.

297
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:06,258
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are basing it off of movies like Sin City.

298
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying the whole game is going to be done in black and white.

299
00:17:10,782 --> 00:17:12,803
[SPEAKER_03]: It's set before the World War.

300
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:17,667
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't get any of the depression prohibition stuff.

301
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:22,431
[SPEAKER_03]: But you get to complain about different things.

302
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:23,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Sin City the game what?

303
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:26,415
[SPEAKER_03]: It's based off of movies like Sin City.

304
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:26,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

305
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:30,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Did we get chicks with guns?

306
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:32,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that was the best part of Sin City was chicks with guns.

307
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:34,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicks with a Sword

308
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:47,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen Sin City.

309
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:48,096
Spoiler!

310
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:49,957
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't seen Sin City.

311
00:17:49,977 --> 00:17:51,478
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your problem?

312
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:53,679
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to go out right away and see this movie.

313
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:57,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I have something called Life, and I've had the movie since it came out on DVD.

314
00:17:57,181 --> 00:18:00,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel Sin City was slightly overrated, but it's worth seeing.

315
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:01,944
[SPEAKER_09]: It's worth your time.

316
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:03,205
[SPEAKER_03]: On a rainy day.

317
00:18:03,745 --> 00:18:06,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this thing that's called Life, where I go to school.

318
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:13,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Next time you're sick with whatever plague you catch next, on the couch, instead of Kingdom Hearts 2, put that down and watch Sin City for a little bit.

319
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:14,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Ace Combat on PSP

320
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:36,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Ace Combat X, Skies of Deception, and I think it is X and not 10 because they haven't gone up to past 5.

321
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:42,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be on the PSP.

322
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:49,967
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a combination campaign-based single-player plane thingy with wireless multiplayer.

323
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:54,712
[SPEAKER_09]: And speaking of numbers, I have not played one Ace Combat game.

324
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Ace Combat 4.

325
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, wasn't the first one on Super Famicom?

326
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:07,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not played one Ace Combat game, original PlayStation.

327
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:08,156
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

328
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:10,298
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's another game I'm thinking of.

329
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:12,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, it doesn't matter.

330
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,601
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's not Top Gun, I don't care.

331
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:16,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, Top Gun was awesome.

332
00:19:16,082 --> 00:19:17,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Top Gun's coming out for the DS.

333
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:19,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck yeah!

334
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:22,066
[SPEAKER_06]: But is it going to be incredibly difficult to land?

335
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:25,641
[SPEAKER_03]: How hard is it going to be to refuel your damn plane?

336
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:27,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't remind me.

337
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:28,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Nightmares.

338
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:39,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Famitsu stated that Namco said that Skies of Deception will feature an original storyline all told through CG.

339
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:47,075
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be a pilot in the Griffith Squadron of the Federal Republic of Aurelia.

340
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:54,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, four planes, the F-14D Super Tomcat, Tornado F-3, F-2A, and MIG-31 Foxhound.

341
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:56,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Foxhound.

342
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:58,383
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they need to tie it in with?

343
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:00,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Ace Combat 6 Oblivion.

344
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:03,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

345
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:08,987
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's actually slated to be out this fall in Japan.

346
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:10,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Hot.

347
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:11,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

348
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:12,149
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

349
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:13,229
[SPEAKER_03]: MMOs!

350
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:15,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh goody, another crack for me to get addicted to.

351
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Pirates of the Caribbean.

352
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:17,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh!

353
00:20:18,123 --> 00:20:19,344
[SPEAKER_03]: which I think is going to be kind of key.

354
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:20,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I already played Puzzle Pirates.

355
00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:22,206
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

356
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:24,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

357
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:28,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to bilge and bilge and bilge.

358
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:28,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

359
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:34,976
[SPEAKER_03]: You were fussing at me for not doing the stupid thing and I changed it and then you decided to change the subject and what the fuck?

360
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:39,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Miss Dark Sakura.

361
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn straight.

362
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:46,785
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as I was saying before Rob so rudely interrupted me,

363
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:48,869
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you saying anyway?

364
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,551
[SPEAKER_09]: You were talking about Pirates of the Caribbean.

365
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:52,231
[SPEAKER_03]: You better go.

366
00:20:54,912 --> 00:20:55,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Disney.

367
00:20:56,313 --> 00:20:57,073
[SPEAKER_03]: We love Disney.

368
00:20:58,794 --> 00:21:07,518
[SPEAKER_03]: They announced the PC MMO Pirates of the Caribbean Online will be there to show at E3, but not on stores until 2007.

369
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:16,202
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposed to launch with the next film coming out, Dead Man's Chest, in the summer, but it's going to be later this year.

370
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:19,374
[SPEAKER_03]: The speculation is that it'll be out with the third film.

371
00:21:20,254 --> 00:21:24,437
[SPEAKER_03]: You can create your own pirate and interact with the characters from the movies.

372
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Hundreds of customizations available.

373
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Buried Treasure, Scary Pirates, and a subscription.

374
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:35,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Scary Pirates 2?

375
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:39,106
[SPEAKER_09]: You know why I want to get this game the day it comes out?

376
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,648
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can have a character named Arr.

377
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:42,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Arr.

378
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:44,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a character named Ger-Arg.

379
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want Arr.

380
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:48,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Our Buffy fans will know this.

381
00:21:49,062 --> 00:21:50,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, unfortunately they will.

382
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:53,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to actually hunt this one down to check out at E3.

383
00:21:54,963 --> 00:22:00,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least, everybody's favorite part, release dates.

384
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Because release dates make for the happy.

385
00:22:09,568 --> 00:22:14,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I didn't get to mention anything that came out last week, the only thing really worth mentioning is

386
00:22:15,426 --> 00:22:42,925

[SPEAKER_03]: They made up for it with Digimon.

395
00:23:13,335 --> 00:23:15,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have one of the old, original Digimon.

396
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:16,036
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine that.

400
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:24,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what a shock.

401
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:27,139

[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

[SPEAKER_07]: Loki!

405
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,290
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing coming out this week.

406
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Not except for Final Fantasy XI.

407
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:37,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of them.

408
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:38,691
[SPEAKER_07]: 360 and the expansion on PlayStation 2.

409
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:39,912
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the PC.

410
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:44,693
[SPEAKER_07]: But other than that, really, there is nothing coming out this week.

411
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:48,513
[SPEAKER_07]: No other games that are worth a damn... Oh, actually, I should take that back.

412
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:51,194
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be... What was it?

413
00:23:51,414 --> 00:23:53,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Dream Falls coming out on the Xbox this week.

414
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:55,955
[SPEAKER_07]: But other than that, there's nothing.

415
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Slow news week, huh?

416
00:23:58,095 --> 00:23:59,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Tokyo Extreme Race or Drift.

417
00:24:00,236 --> 00:24:00,676
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

418
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:03,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, tell us about another MMO, Loki.

419
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:06,275
[SPEAKER_09]: We had DarkSakura talking about Puzzle Pirates 2.

420
00:24:08,476 --> 00:24:11,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Pirates... Never mind.

421
00:24:11,498 --> 00:24:12,939
[SPEAKER_03]: You were the addict to Puzzle Pirates.

422
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:13,999
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a fun game.

423
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:21,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to announce that they actually announced the MMO last year at E3.

424
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:29,227
[SPEAKER_07]: They gave out these stupid gold coins that you would get to go have special access to the...

425
00:24:30,632 --> 00:24:32,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Show Floor, or something, this year.

426
00:24:33,293 --> 00:24:35,474
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, we knew it was coming.

427
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:42,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, we didn't know what was coming, though, was this game coming from Acclaim, who's doing a martial arts MMO.

428
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,738
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, martial arts MMO.

429
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:47,239
[SPEAKER_07]: No one cares.

430
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:52,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, it's going to be called Nine Dragons, being developed by Indie21.

431
00:24:54,162 --> 00:25:00,144
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's supposed to be to put gamers in their own kung fu fighting online game.

432
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:04,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds kind of like, was it Matrix Online to me?

433
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:06,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that game is all Kung Fu.

434
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:12,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, it's currently planned to be released later this year.

435
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:14,670
[SPEAKER_07]: So, look for that.

436
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:19,671
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, why are there so many MMOs?

437
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:26,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because not only do you get the sucker to buy the game at first, but then you get them to pay for it every month.

438
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:26,773
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why.

439
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:29,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we keep buying them.

440
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:31,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

441
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:35,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's my Blaster Master MMO?

442
00:25:37,414 --> 00:25:43,299
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember one very popular MMO started on a Dreamcast, on the Dreamcast, that was Phantasy Star.

443
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:47,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I don't know if I'd call Phantasy Star so much an MMO as it is like a multiplayer experience.

444
00:25:48,743 --> 00:25:53,707
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a multiplayer repetitive action game, which I actually still occasionally play.

445
00:25:55,322 --> 00:26:03,647
[SPEAKER_09]: A story from Retro Gaming has been circulating the blogs, video game stuff out there this week.

446
00:26:04,027 --> 00:26:07,108
[SPEAKER_09]: It's games that defined the Dreamcast.

447
00:26:07,389 --> 00:26:10,710
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thought maybe we could nerd out a little bit and talk about the Dreamcast for a minute.

448
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:13,912
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think are some games that defined the Dreamcast?

449
00:26:14,152 --> 00:26:20,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Since you mentioned Phantasy Star Universe, I'd like to mention that Phantasy Star Universe is supposed to be coming out on October 25th.

450
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:21,956
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the ones I forgot to mention.

451
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:23,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that from your little list there?

452
00:26:23,157 --> 00:26:23,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

453
00:26:23,477 --> 00:26:24,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, there you go.

454
00:26:24,638 --> 00:26:24,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

455
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:25,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Stinger.

456
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:31,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm referring specifically to the Japanese version because the US version was ass.

457
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:35,741
[SPEAKER_03]: As in not even a nice one, as more like a stinky unwashed ass.

458
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:37,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that visual.

459
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,788
[SPEAKER_03]: The Japanese one had these really massive camera angles, just cinematic.

460
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:53,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though the gameplay was pretty, you know, beat thingy with stick, lightsaber...

461
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Run Up A Tower, blah, blah, blah.

462
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:58,229
[SPEAKER_03]: The camera angles, I thought, were just so neat.

463
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:07,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It was such a different experience playing that as opposed to a lot of the stuff that was on the PlayStation because, you know, you scroll out too far on PlayStation, it would just completely look crap.

464
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:10,458
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's kept such a good look.

465
00:27:10,478 --> 00:27:14,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it made it difficult to play in places, but, you know, I actually liked Boostinger.

466
00:27:14,822 --> 00:27:19,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I traded my copy of the Dragon Ball GT game.

467
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:20,627
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

468
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Which at the time was stupid because it was going for $150 on eBay.

469
00:27:23,891 --> 00:27:24,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we all make mistakes.

470
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:28,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, Spike, any defining Dreamcast games for you?

471
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:34,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Power Stone, Crazy Taxi, and Jet Set Radio.

472
00:27:35,193 --> 00:27:38,734
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another... Crap.

473
00:27:40,474 --> 00:27:41,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Evolution, actually.

474
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:46,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought, because it brought out... Actually, Grandia 2 was also another good one.

475
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:48,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Space Channel 5.

476
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:50,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Spike, anything that comes to mind for you?

477
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:55,892
[SPEAKER_06]: So Project Justice definitely comes to mind.

478
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:56,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen!

479
00:27:57,377 --> 00:27:59,463
[SPEAKER_03]: The Japanese one with the little board game.

480
00:28:00,006 --> 00:28:00,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

481
00:28:00,606 --> 00:28:03,048
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so much fun, and you could customize your character.

482
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:03,768
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, though?

483
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:09,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to admit, I was a little upset that we didn't have another school life mode, like the Japanese PlayStation games.

484
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:14,936
[SPEAKER_03]: The, um, yeah, the second rival schools, the Shiri to Justice Kakouen that they did?

485
00:28:14,996 --> 00:28:15,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

486
00:28:15,456 --> 00:28:18,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, I paid 90 bucks to import that thing.

487
00:28:18,438 --> 00:28:18,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.

488
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:20,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I had such a hard time finding it.

489
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love playing through the high school mode!

490
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:25,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got wished happy birthday by Batsu.

491
00:28:26,323 --> 00:28:29,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, see, I was always trying to get Nagare to fall in love with me.

492
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I never did.

493
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:46,654
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the game that gave us, uh, the, uh, you could play as, uh, Ran, as Ran, as, uh, Nagare, um, but, uh, but, uh, Moaru, uh, Justice Kakuen gave us, um, Zaki, who was

494
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:57,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, one of my first pieces of fan art that ever got published by another site was one of the big rival schools websites took a fan art I did of Zaki.

495
00:28:57,792 --> 00:29:00,153
[SPEAKER_09]: You're listening to the Geeky Dreamcast Gamer Podcast.

496
00:29:00,713 --> 00:29:05,334
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, we've got to mention DDR Second Mix Club version.

497
00:29:06,854 --> 00:29:08,395
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my first DDR that I owned.

498
00:29:08,535 --> 00:29:12,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Extover wants to participate in tonight's show by naming, I guess, something, a Dreamcast game?

499
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,297
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised that you didn't name it, but Sonic Adventure.

500
00:29:17,317 --> 00:29:17,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?

501

[SPEAKER_06]: I actually, I bought the little Saturn adapter so I could use my Saturn twin sticks.

507
00:30:41,744 --> 00:30:43,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I still need Saturn twin sticks.

00:31:52,188 --> 00:31:53,269

[SPEAKER_09]: I thought of a really, really good one.

539
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:17,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought of a really good one.

[SPEAKER_09]: The Typing of the Dead.

541
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,060

[SPEAKER_09]: Yay, I win.

544
00:32:21,661 --> 00:32:23,882
[SPEAKER_09]: I get to participate in the geeky chat.

545
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:27,323
[SPEAKER_03]: It also has spawned some of the best cosplay ever.

546
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:31,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I plan on eventually doing some cosplay once people kind of forget about that game.

547
00:32:32,185 --> 00:32:33,746
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we really, really got to move on.

548
00:32:33,806 --> 00:32:34,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

549
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:34,346
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

550
00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:38,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people are saying that the Xbox 360 is kind of a new version of the Dreamcast.

551
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:39,289
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

552
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:39,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Take it or leave it.

553
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,272
[SPEAKER_09]: But what's going on with Burnout on the Xbox 360, Loki?

554
00:32:44,732 --> 00:32:48,915
[SPEAKER_07]: They finally, finally fixed it.

555
00:32:49,475 --> 00:32:54,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So now I can play the damn car I downloaded off the Xbox 360 kiosk months ago.

556
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:57,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid bastards.

557
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Teasing me at the damn car they'll be able to play when they get the game and couldn't play it for months.

558
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:10,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, but they did add some new cars to download as well online, so you can get a bunch of cars that they've whored out from different sponsors.

559
00:33:10,897 --> 00:33:22,947
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the updates, well, other than the cars on the kiosks working now, you cannot spam your recommended clips to people on your recent players list.

560
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:25,129
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, people that you just played in games.

561
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:26,890
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't go, hey, look at my clip that I made.

562
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:27,551
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucks.

563
00:33:27,611 --> 00:33:28,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to get achievements.

564
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,252
[SPEAKER_07]: So there.

565
00:33:31,906 --> 00:33:33,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I was sitting here like, what's yellow card?

566
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:34,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Rob.

567
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:34,828
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

568
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I did check it out a little bit.

569
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:04,364
[SPEAKER_07]: But the only thing that I don't like is you have to unlock the cars in the game.

570
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:06,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that kind of sucks.

571
00:34:06,966 --> 00:34:07,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

572
00:34:10,068 --> 00:34:10,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Go check that out.

573
00:34:11,108 --> 00:34:11,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Download it.

574
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:12,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoy it.

575
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:14,810
[SPEAKER_09]: One person that will probably not be playing... Yes?

576
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,492
[SPEAKER_03]: The chatroom just made me happy because they remembered Rod Caliber.

577
00:34:18,732 --> 00:34:19,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Dorks.

578
00:34:19,552 --> 00:34:20,353
[SPEAKER_09]: We're done with Dreamcast.

579
00:34:20,373 --> 00:34:20,913
[SPEAKER_09]: We're done with Dreamcast.

580
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but it has a special place in my heart.

581
00:34:23,414 --> 00:34:25,355
[SPEAKER_09]: We can never be done with Dreamcast.

582
00:34:25,535 --> 00:34:29,477
[SPEAKER_09]: One person that never touched a Dreamcast, you can be certain, is Jack Thompson.

583
00:34:29,537 --> 00:34:32,118
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's Jack up to this week, DarkSakura?

584
00:34:32,298 --> 00:34:34,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Jackie Poo is being a poopy head.

585
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:35,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

586
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Professionalism, right.

587
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:41,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he's filed suit against the Florida Bar Association.

588
00:34:42,863 --> 00:34:43,123
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

589
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:52,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, as reported by a daily business review, also reposted with GamePolitics, who are our heroes.

590
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:52,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we love them.

591
00:34:53,231 --> 00:35:03,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's filed a million-dollar federal lawsuit against the Florida Bar saying that the organization is harassing him by investigating his baseless complaints.

592
00:35:05,074 --> 00:35:06,594
[SPEAKER_09]: One million dollars!

593
00:35:09,335 --> 00:35:13,196
[SPEAKER_03]: But, and I love what GamePolitics commented on this, just to quote,

594
00:35:13,891 --> 00:35:19,162
[SPEAKER_03]: We're glad someone enjoys what Jack does but we've reread the First Amendment umpteen times and still can't find the right to annoy people.

595
00:35:22,008 --> 00:35:22,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen.

596
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,582
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this post in our forums.

597
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:27,043
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could read this from our forums.

598
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:30,707
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this listener.

599
00:35:30,747 --> 00:35:32,508
[SPEAKER_09]: He makes a lot of great posts on our forums here.

600
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,050
[SPEAKER_09]: The Ichiban Crush.

601
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,292
[SPEAKER_03]: He posted the bunny picture on my MySpace.

602
00:35:36,632 --> 00:35:39,074
[SPEAKER_09]: We love our listeners, and this guy's just living proof.

603
00:35:39,094 --> 00:35:40,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this post he made.

604
00:35:40,496 --> 00:35:44,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Regarding Jackie Poo, I actually hope no one makes a game to his description.

605
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:49,744
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a follow-up to last week's story where we talked about the whole Jack Thompson hates joystick and all that.

606
00:35:50,384 --> 00:35:52,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Because with his last modest proposal, what did he do?

607
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:56,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Back out of his promise of donating $10,000 to charity when someone called his bluff.

608
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:03,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and let's not even get into the hissy-fits he targeted towards everyone who pointed out Jack's lack of credibility or paid the fee on his behalf.

609
00:36:04,376 --> 00:36:11,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are we even giving a shit about this parasitic, ambulance-chasing, morally bankrupted, failure of a lawyer and human being anymore?

610
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:17,086
[SPEAKER_09]: In the grand scheme of things, has he made an ounce of influence in the way we as gamers or the game industry does its thing?

611
00:36:17,406 --> 00:36:18,267
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not at all.

612
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:21,250
[SPEAKER_09]: What we have here is an over-glorified internet troll.

613
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing more, nothing less.

614
00:36:23,212 --> 00:36:26,836
[SPEAKER_09]: His own actions weaken any and all chance for these holy crusades coming through.

615
00:36:27,156 --> 00:36:31,461
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't even about fundamentalist antics anymore because it seems even those guys are laughing at him.

616
00:36:31,801 --> 00:36:33,503
[SPEAKER_09]: So no, I wouldn't give him what he wants.

617
00:36:33,803 --> 00:36:36,206
[SPEAKER_09]: More people to cry wolf about to the authorities.

618
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:37,808
[SPEAKER_09]: It's trolls bait, folks.

619
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't bite.

620
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:41,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Love it.

621
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:42,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Love it.

622
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:44,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we even be reporting on him anymore?

623
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:45,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

624
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:51,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like we have an obligation to, but at the same time, I totally get the village idiot perspective.

625
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:53,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sick.

626
00:36:53,585 --> 00:36:57,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really sick of everything having to do with his name coming up.

627
00:36:57,168 --> 00:37:01,272
[SPEAKER_03]: We dealt with him in the mid-90s over the whole cop killer thing for Ice-T.

628
00:37:03,314 --> 00:37:04,935
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're dealing with him over video games.

629
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:33,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see, you know, of course people are going to complain about him because he's displayed this utter lack of professionalism in all of his dealings with everybody.

630
00:37:34,182 --> 00:37:43,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, people have reposted emails where he has just completely gone to name-calling and finger-pointing like a freaking schoolyard bully, you know.

631
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:46,273
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all he is, is an overblown bully.

632
00:37:48,383 --> 00:37:51,728
[SPEAKER_03]: All he's trying to do is keep his name in the spotlight.

633
00:37:51,768 --> 00:37:53,731
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't about helping families.

634
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,175
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't about cleaning up America.

635
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:59,941
[SPEAKER_03]: This is about keeping money in his pocket and the spotlight on him.

636
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:08,814
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, one thing, though, that I guess is good, a good thing that comes from all this reporting on this guy is it really does bring the game community together in really interesting ways.

637
00:38:08,894 --> 00:38:12,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Take that whole, you know, Pixelante thing, the flowers for Jack.

638
00:38:12,817 --> 00:38:18,120
[SPEAKER_09]: At least there's that good, that little silver lining that comes out of it as it brings people together out of their hatred for this guy.

639
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:24,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what he needs to also keep in mind that the majority of people who buy video games are in our age group.

640
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,373
[SPEAKER_03]: The people in this room, we are the ones who are paying for these games.

641
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:30,715
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the ones who are doing a lot of the playing.

642
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:35,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And true, yeah, a lot of teenagers and younger kids are playing games.

643
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,983
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're the ones who've been keeping the industry going.

644
00:38:39,043 --> 00:38:40,144
[SPEAKER_03]: We were there from the beginning.

645
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:46,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I've brought up before,

646
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:53,628
[SPEAKER_03]: There has been so much concrete proof to refute everything he's saying and he just refuses to accept fact as fact.

647
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:55,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly am sick of him.

648
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sick of how utterly stupid he is.

649
00:39:00,113 --> 00:39:04,777
[SPEAKER_03]: He's proof that one can have a college education and still be retarded.

650
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:09,276
[SPEAKER_09]: You can address those cards and letters to DarkSakura.

651
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:10,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.

652
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:13,020
[SPEAKER_03]: If he emails anybody, email me.

653
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you exactly what I think about you.

654
00:39:14,862 --> 00:39:17,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnRadio.com if anybody wants to comment.

655
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,905
[SPEAKER_09]: The U.S.

656
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:22,567
[SPEAKER_09]: isn't the only place where video games are investigated.

657
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:30,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Japan's National Police Agency is currently investigating the effects playing video games and watching anime has on children.

658
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:37,838
[SPEAKER_09]: This is being led by a former Deputy Governor of Tokyo, Yutaka Takahana.

659
00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:45,303
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys met on April 10th in Tokyo to discuss violent video games and sexual content on the internet.

660
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:58,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Previously, though, there really hasn't been a whole lot of controversy in Japan regarding the in-game violence, but this current generation of games, of course, Grand Theft Auto and so on, sort of brings this back to the spotlight there.

661
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:10,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, it should be pointed out, the sale of Grand Theft Auto 3 was actually banned from being sold to anyone under the age of 18 in two separate Japanese prefectures.

662
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:18,901
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and so on, so they're just doing this study here, I guess seeing if maybe they need to be a little more tighter on this stuff in Japan.

663
00:40:21,023 --> 00:40:22,064
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, doubt it'll happen.

664
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:27,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the only thing anime does is just warp our sense of what kind of women we can achieve, you know.

665
00:40:28,246 --> 00:40:30,908
[SPEAKER_07]: and women don't have breasts that are that big.

666
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,070
[SPEAKER_07]: At least not that many of them.

667
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:37,474
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, tentacle rape is not good.

668
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:45,566
[SPEAKER_09]: All this stuff about the laws and the people that keep talking about this stuff, it just makes me angry.

669
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:48,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about you guys, but I get a little bit angry when I think about this stuff.

670
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:55,537
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's why we have a segment here on Orange Lounge Radio dedicated to getting a little bit of this angst out of our system.

671
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:57,419
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's called the FUs of the Week.

672
00:40:57,819 --> 00:40:59,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you ready to get angsty, boys and girls?

673
00:41:13,717 --> 00:41:43,350
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura F you to whatever that fatigue shit I had was earlier in the week because it sucked I actually like being able to get out of bed and do stuff and I hate missing the show so yeah just F you to whatever has caused the weird random fatigue I had Loki F you to the amount of alcohol I drank last night because that sucked and F you to certain sites

674
00:41:44,383 --> 00:41:48,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

675
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:54,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Spike!

676
00:41:55,445 --> 00:41:56,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any FUs?

677
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,166
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to cellular phones that don't work.

678
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:02,226
[SPEAKER_09]: That would make me angry too.

679
00:42:03,126 --> 00:42:08,007
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU this week goes to Loki for not singing karaoke last night, despite how drunk we got him.

680
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:11,468
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have to kill me for this, you big pussy.

681
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:13,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you sing when you die?

682
00:42:14,508 --> 00:42:14,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

683
00:42:16,888 --> 00:42:18,189
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll sing when he's dead.

684
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:21,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki!

685
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:25,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Sing to us a little bit about Nintendo DS's other news.

686
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,510
[SPEAKER_09]: The DS is getting a TV... No, I said sing.

687
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:30,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kidding, go ahead.

688
00:42:30,491 --> 00:42:32,171
[SPEAKER_07]: The DS is getting a TV tuner.

689
00:42:33,271 --> 00:42:36,012
[SPEAKER_07]: A TV tuner the size of an Xbox.

690
00:42:36,952 --> 00:42:38,852
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the TV tuner is ginormous.

691
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,253
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah, it's not very portable.

692
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:45,840
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're interested, it is available.

693
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,362
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently, well, I don't know.

694
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,423
[SPEAKER_07]: It's being reported by Famitsu Magazine.

695
00:42:52,663 --> 00:42:53,424
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a picture of it.

696
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:56,865
[SPEAKER_07]: And it literally is bigger than a DS.

697
00:42:58,266 --> 00:42:59,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're talking old DS.

698
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:01,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

699
00:43:03,029 --> 00:43:08,872
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently, you know, if it's like any of the other TV tuners out there, probably doesn't get very good reception.

700
00:43:10,873 --> 00:43:11,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

701
00:43:12,193 --> 00:43:13,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So why would anybody want to buy this?

702
00:43:14,445 --> 00:43:15,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, fair enough

703
00:43:20,143 --> 00:43:23,664
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, also coming to the DS, Sudoku Gridmaster.

704
00:43:24,264 --> 00:43:26,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo recently announced that they're going to be putting this out.

705
00:43:26,865 --> 00:43:32,707
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to have over 400 puzzles and use the DS's touchscreen and handwriting recognition software.

706
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,368
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll have practice mode, easy mode, normal, and hard mode.

707
00:43:37,108 --> 00:43:38,248
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is supposed to come out June 26.

708
00:43:38,328 --> 00:43:42,650
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm not sure of, though, is if that means Japan or the US.

709
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:47,031
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm thinking, come on, another freaking Sudoku game?

710
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:52,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the only way this game would sell is if they made it look like Tetris DS.

711
00:43:52,092 --> 00:43:54,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, put 16-bit Nintendo characters in it.

712
00:43:54,993 --> 00:43:56,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's Mario presents Sudoku!

713
00:43:56,753 --> 00:43:59,274
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it would sell like freaking crazy.

714
00:43:59,454 --> 00:44:00,054
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you want to bet?

715
00:44:01,134 --> 00:44:06,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Sudoku, just put Link on it, put Zelda's face on it, do something, and people will eat that shit up.

716
00:44:06,695 --> 00:44:07,116
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Nintendo way.

717
00:44:07,136 --> 00:44:07,996
[SPEAKER_09]: The legend of Sudoku.

718
00:44:08,096 --> 00:44:09,456
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the legend of Sudoku.

719
00:44:10,656 --> 00:44:12,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to name my firstborn Sudoku.

720
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:12,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

721
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:14,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not.

722
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,682
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am naming my... When I have a son, I'm naming him Richter.

723
00:44:19,222 --> 00:44:20,063
[SPEAKER_03]: After Richter Belmont.

724
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:20,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're a geek.

725
00:44:21,403 --> 00:44:23,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you pronounce it like the bad English dub?

726
00:44:23,905 --> 00:44:24,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Richter.

727
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:25,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Richter.

728
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:28,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you have to wipe out your eye every time you talk to Maria.

729
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:30,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for knowing where I was going with that.

730
00:44:31,028 --> 00:44:34,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Before DarkSakura coughs up a lung there with the Richter thing...

731
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:39,726
[SPEAKER_09]: The Grudge is like two years old now, stop.

732
00:44:40,087 --> 00:44:44,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Although they do make a reference to The Grudge in Scary Movie 4, which came out on Friday.

733
00:44:44,235 --> 00:44:45,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, but I heard it sucks.

734
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:46,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was funny.

735
00:44:47,068 --> 00:44:47,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

736
00:44:47,828 --> 00:44:48,529
[SPEAKER_09]: You heard wrong.

737
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:51,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a matter of everyone's opinion.

738
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,591
[SPEAKER_09]: What did it get on the tomato meter?

739
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:53,851
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I want to know.

740
00:44:54,312 --> 00:44:55,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I really have no interest in seeing it.

741
00:44:55,712 --> 00:44:56,693
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

742
00:44:56,813 --> 00:44:58,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, more DS, new Mario Brothers.

743
00:44:58,954 --> 00:44:59,634
[SPEAKER_09]: What's happening with that?

744
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:02,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're going to be having some of the mini games in Mario Brothers.

745
00:45:03,656 --> 00:45:06,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Very similar to what you saw in Super Mario 64 for the DS.

746
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:09,660
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest, I think I played the mini games more than I actually played the games.

747
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,482
[SPEAKER_07]: But this time around, you'll actually be able to play the multiplayer, which is pretty sweet.

748
00:45:15,603 --> 00:45:19,005
[SPEAKER_07]: So some mini-game action for you to be shared with friends.

749
00:45:19,986 --> 00:45:20,766
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be fun.

750
00:45:21,446 --> 00:45:21,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't wait.

751
00:45:21,807 --> 00:45:22,947
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be fun-tastic.

752
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:23,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun-tastic.

753
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:27,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Another friend code for you to have to manage with your friends.

754
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:28,531
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be a lot of fun.

755
00:45:28,571 --> 00:45:31,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know if it's over the internet.

756
00:45:31,933 --> 00:45:33,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's through your Wi-Fi service.

757
00:45:33,293 --> 00:45:34,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just local.

758
00:45:35,074 --> 00:45:35,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

759
00:45:36,135 --> 00:45:36,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Lame.

760
00:45:37,356 --> 00:45:37,636
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

761
00:45:40,011 --> 00:45:48,715
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down researching Dreamcast games, but once in a while she comes on another website that she wants to share with all of you guys.

762
00:45:48,775 --> 00:45:50,976
[SPEAKER_09]: It's DarkSakura's website of the week.

763
00:45:51,256 --> 00:45:54,418
[SPEAKER_09]: And where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week, DarkSakura?

764
00:45:55,258 --> 00:46:08,404
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the site that's had me mesmerized for about three hours as a few people online, Ranma's one of them, can attest to because I kept linking pictures, Snopes.com, S-N-O-P-E-S.com.

765
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:11,041
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically an urban legends reference page.

766
00:46:11,381 --> 00:46:12,002
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fabulous.

767
00:46:13,183 --> 00:46:22,270
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, someone on my... And I knew about this site for a while, but someone actually linked a picture of the world's largest rabbit, who was like as big as a dog.

768
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:24,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a golden retriever.

769
00:46:25,593 --> 00:46:30,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's real, and there's lots of interesting pictures in here, like the Cyclops cat, and...

770
00:46:32,842 --> 00:46:34,602
[SPEAKER_03]: A twin, well, a two-headed baby.

771
00:46:35,122 --> 00:46:39,144
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually was like a head and half of a body attached to her head.

772
00:46:39,644 --> 00:46:41,145
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually had the other twin removed.

773
00:46:42,265 --> 00:46:45,687
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, some of this is, you know, there's the fake ones on here.

774
00:46:45,707 --> 00:46:51,029
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically any urban legend that's been reported and they investigate it and let you know if it's real or not.

775
00:46:51,289 --> 00:46:57,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this site because I get those crappy forwards from coworkers all the time of these totally untrue things.

776
00:46:57,634 --> 00:47:04,799
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I'll do is I'll go onto Snopes.com and find the little article, and I'll just copy-paste the link in an email back, and I always reply to all.

777
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

778
00:47:06,801 --> 00:47:14,026
[SPEAKER_03]: But just for a little overview, the hottest 25 urban legends as of...

779
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:17,336
[SPEAKER_03]: This week is there's one about gas.

780
00:47:17,356 --> 00:47:18,376
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the giant rabbit.

781
00:47:19,557 --> 00:47:22,960
[SPEAKER_03]: One about Bill Gates doing a Microsoft and AOL giveaway.

782
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,461
[SPEAKER_03]: And about the brown recluse spider.

783
00:47:25,982 --> 00:47:26,962
[SPEAKER_03]: The effects of the brown recluse.

784
00:47:28,483 --> 00:47:29,364
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

785
00:47:29,944 --> 00:47:30,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Check it out.

786
00:47:30,325 --> 00:47:34,047
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be required reading for anybody who wants to send a forward email.

787
00:47:35,508 --> 00:47:38,410
[SPEAKER_03]: For the sake of the chat room, I am going to link the giant rabbit story.

788
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:38,751
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

789
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:39,131
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

790
00:47:40,572 --> 00:47:42,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, you'll have to beg for it in the forums.

791
00:47:42,398 --> 00:47:49,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot to mention when we were talking about useless games and stuff that's coming out this week, Brain Age is actually coming out this week.

792
00:47:50,262 --> 00:47:50,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, is it?

793
00:47:50,862 --> 00:47:51,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

794
00:47:51,563 --> 00:47:52,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's this week?

795
00:47:53,223 --> 00:47:53,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe so.

796
00:47:53,724 --> 00:47:54,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

797
00:47:54,924 --> 00:47:56,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so much for useless games coming out.

798
00:47:56,485 --> 00:47:57,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want that one.

799
00:47:57,526 --> 00:47:58,386
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still not a game.

800
00:47:59,266 --> 00:48:00,147
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to check it out anyway.

801
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:05,595
[SPEAKER_09]: One game I've always been meaning to check out that I seem to never get around to is Civilization 4.

802
00:48:06,376 --> 00:48:14,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's actually a patch, see what I'm waiting for is I'm waiting for like the ultimate Civ 4 compilation to come out for 20 bucks in like a year because that's what always happens with Civilization games.

803
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:20,545
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, if you're a rabid Civilization fan who's getting your fix right now, there's a brand new patch.

804
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:21,245
[SPEAKER_09]: and so on.

805
00:48:36,534 --> 00:48:37,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Subtitles by Subtitle Workshop

806
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:02,618
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a good one right here, Civilization IV, Make Your Own Scenarios.

807
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,203
[SPEAKER_09]: It is down to $30 if you want to pick up the game.

808
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,385
[SPEAKER_09]: It's down from, I think, $50 when it first came out.

809
00:49:08,425 --> 00:49:11,289
[SPEAKER_09]: It's down to $29.99, or as I call it, $30.

810
00:49:15,534 --> 00:49:16,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, Loki.

811
00:49:17,316 --> 00:49:17,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

812
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:18,938
[SPEAKER_07]: What's making a comeback?

813
00:49:20,148 --> 00:49:23,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully not a weeble, but Alone in the Dark.

814
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:31,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember they were showing some pictures of Alone in the Dark, the new one, and that actually looked kind of pretty cool, and they have some screenshots up right now.

815
00:49:31,455 --> 00:49:36,598
[SPEAKER_07]: But 1UP is reporting that Alone in the Dark will rear its head on next-gen consoles very soon.

816
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:39,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Something you probably will see at E3, maybe.

817
00:49:41,301 --> 00:49:42,221
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll have to wait.

818
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:46,263
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be showing it in, I think, the next Electronic Gaming Monthly.

819
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:48,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Should be interesting.

820
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Are You Alone in the Dark?

821
00:49:53,404 --> 00:49:56,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and I'm playing a crappy video game called Alone in the Dark.

822
00:49:56,787 --> 00:49:59,369
[SPEAKER_07]: If I remember correctly, I did read a little bit about this.

823
00:49:59,389 --> 00:50:00,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

824
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:09,818
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually supposed to be set in Central Park in New York in something about I don't remember now, but something paranormal, of course.

825
00:50:10,618 --> 00:50:12,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Violent paranormal hobos?

826
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Horrible movies being made.

827
00:50:16,343 --> 00:50:17,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's responsible?

828
00:50:18,245 --> 00:50:19,926
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see Typing of the Dead make a comeback.

829
00:50:21,468 --> 00:50:22,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Sudoku of the Dead

830
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:43,823
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually Guitar Room Man on the PSP.

831
00:50:45,885 --> 00:50:54,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, on the Japanese PlayStation site, there's a product posting announcing a second Guitar Room Man.

832
00:50:54,872 --> 00:50:56,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, published by Koei.

833
00:50:57,273 --> 00:50:59,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Koei gave us KO Flying Squadron.

834
00:50:59,135 --> 00:50:59,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I like them.

835
00:51:00,436 --> 00:51:00,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

836
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:12,543
[SPEAKER_03]: But as Guitar Man Live for the PSP, follow-up to the first Guitar Man that was on PlayStation 2, there's speculation that there's going to be demos at E3.

837
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:14,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, that will be true.

838
00:51:15,124 --> 00:51:17,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be living at wherever that is.

839
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:20,226
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

840
00:51:23,356 --> 00:51:50,050
[SPEAKER_03]: there's very few details out on it right now although there's a new feature that's being advertised that has network play but not online compatible and you can compete head to head or cooperative in duet mode it's supposed to be a bit more balanced the music and vocals are provided by actual Japanese pop stars maybe it'll be someone that we've heard of over here

841
00:51:51,019 --> 00:51:51,519
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be cool.

842
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to be pretty cool.

843
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to it.

844
00:51:54,061 --> 00:51:54,301
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

845
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:54,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.

846
00:51:55,762 --> 00:51:59,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Our Skype line is open over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

847
00:51:59,164 --> 00:52:00,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Click on Interact With Us.

848
00:52:00,665 --> 00:52:02,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's pick up some calls.

849
00:52:02,627 --> 00:52:02,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

850
00:52:02,927 --> 00:52:04,208
[SPEAKER_09]: You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

851
00:52:05,128 --> 00:52:05,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.

852
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,249
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the first one on.

853
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:06,849
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Ranma.

854
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:07,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Ranma.

855
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,030
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

856
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:09,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

857
00:52:09,331 --> 00:52:12,273
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to cover a couple of things and I'm on my way out of here.

858
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:13,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Runtime.

859
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Ukyo!

860
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:17,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, stop.

861
00:52:17,941 --> 00:52:19,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Less love, more news.

862
00:52:19,182 --> 00:52:19,522
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

863
00:52:19,922 --> 00:52:20,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey!

864
00:52:20,362 --> 00:52:30,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I want to talk about the Xbox emulator, and I can explain better why it's taking it so long to convert games, make them all compatible and stuff.

865
00:52:32,647 --> 00:52:33,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, what is up with that?

866
00:52:35,228 --> 00:52:38,669
[SPEAKER_09]: On the 360, very few games are compatible.

867
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:39,209
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up with that?

868
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:43,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, from my knowledge of working with computers and technology, it's like this.

869
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:49,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Xbox is Pentium 3 and Xbox 360 is like a core cell processor, something like that.

870
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:53,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, the emulator has to convert the coding and stuff so it'll work.

871
00:52:54,665 --> 00:53:01,928
[SPEAKER_10]: As for the graphics processor, that part really doesn't matter per se because even though it's optimized for NVIDIA, it's still like a generic graphics set.

872
00:53:01,948 --> 00:53:05,810
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll still work on the quote-unquote new ATI graphics chipset or whatever.

873
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:07,631
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not optimized for NVIDIA.

874
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:09,151
[SPEAKER_07]: It's built by NVIDIA.

875
00:53:09,572 --> 00:53:10,312
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little different.

876
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:23,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I still think it's fucked that you can play Barbie and not DDR.

877
00:53:23,957 --> 00:53:24,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, fuck that.

878
00:53:26,098 --> 00:53:26,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

879
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:33,241
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I understand why, because, you know, they get one game to work, and usually about ten games are very similar to that, but still, it's messed up.

880
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:34,782
[SPEAKER_09]: It's wrong.

881
00:53:35,102 --> 00:53:35,902
[SPEAKER_09]: It's wrong!

882
00:53:36,543 --> 00:53:37,583
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I know.

883
00:53:37,603 --> 00:53:39,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anything else, Ranma?

884
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,072
[SPEAKER_10]: How goes your training against Jack Thompson?

885
00:53:42,092 --> 00:53:44,121
[SPEAKER_10]: I got 51 odds on you to kick his ass.

886
00:53:45,563 --> 00:53:47,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, he's kind of old and broken.

887
00:53:47,763 --> 00:53:49,304
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'd win in a fight.

888
00:53:50,264 --> 00:53:53,405
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we don't want to get sued over threatening to fight him or whatever.

889
00:53:54,865 --> 00:54:06,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just speculating that if I had to defend myself, if a rabid Jack Thompson came to Sacramento and wanted to beat me up or give me rabies, then I would win in a fight.

890
00:54:06,268 --> 00:54:07,688
[SPEAKER_10]: He's coming right for us.

891
00:54:09,308 --> 00:54:12,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie, you didn't hear last week's show, did you?

892
00:54:13,289 --> 00:54:14,490
[SPEAKER_10]: I was sort of dead.

893
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob basically told Jack to bring it on.

894
00:54:17,211 --> 00:54:17,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, that's right.

895
00:54:17,952 --> 00:54:18,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I called Jack out.

896
00:54:19,233 --> 00:54:20,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, bring it, bitch.

897
00:54:20,754 --> 00:54:21,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, bring it.

898
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:23,875
[SPEAKER_03]: We would own him so hard.

899
00:54:23,895 --> 00:54:24,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Not physically.

900
00:54:24,376 --> 00:54:25,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, we could have a war of words.

901
00:54:25,616 --> 00:54:31,080
[SPEAKER_09]: I said I would be cordial to him and let him have his say, but then he would have to listen to everything I have to say in return.

902
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,240
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

903
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:37,523
[SPEAKER_03]: That wouldn't be fair because, well, we would just completely decimate him.

904
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:38,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

905
00:54:38,664 --> 00:54:41,526
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot have a battle of wits against an unarmed opponent.

906
00:54:42,506 --> 00:54:43,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Point taken.

907
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright Ranma, we gotta get some more calls, but thank you so much for the call.

908
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:47,744
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem.

909
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:48,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Love it.

910
00:54:48,366 --> 00:54:48,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Love you guys.

911
00:54:49,048 --> 00:54:49,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

912
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:55,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Some folks in the chat room are asking, SSJ100, Matt wants to know, did we do peep jousting this year?

913
00:54:55,473 --> 00:54:58,916
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually something that happened on the old show, Vanilla Sky, one of my spinoff shows.

914
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,978
[SPEAKER_09]: We did not do peep jousting this morning.

915
00:55:02,058 --> 00:55:06,961
[SPEAKER_09]: And for those that don't know what peep jousting is, that is when you, on Easter, actually, you can do this any day.

916
00:55:07,702 --> 00:55:10,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Take some marshmallow peeps, but it's easiest around Easter.

917
00:55:10,604 --> 00:55:17,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Take some marshmallow peeps and stick some toothpicks in them and then put them in the microwave and watch them get really, really, really, really big.

918
00:55:17,128 --> 00:55:20,130
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at one point, one peep has to slaughter the other.

919
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:21,510
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

920
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:47,081
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

921
00:56:10,011 --> 00:56:10,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey.

922
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:11,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, who's this?

923
00:56:11,992 --> 00:56:13,273
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Did You Lose a Sock?

924
00:56:13,713 --> 00:56:14,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Did You Lose a Sock?

925
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:15,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

926
00:56:15,974 --> 00:56:16,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't recognize that name.

927
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,576
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very cool.

928
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Long time podcast listener.

929
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,518
[SPEAKER_08]: First time listening live.

930
00:56:22,778 --> 00:56:23,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

931
00:56:23,439 --> 00:56:24,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, welcome.

932
00:56:24,819 --> 00:56:25,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the show.

933
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the madness.

934
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:26,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

935
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

936
00:56:28,181 --> 00:56:30,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to call in and say awesome show.

937
00:56:30,522 --> 00:56:31,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Loved it.

938
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:36,606
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's stupid that people think Mac gaming is going to die.

939
00:56:37,745 --> 00:56:39,325
[SPEAKER_08]: That Mac gaming is going to die?

940
00:56:39,925 --> 00:56:43,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's... Oh, because the whole dual boot thing?

941
00:56:43,826 --> 00:56:46,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think people are stupid thinking that it will die.

942
00:56:47,027 --> 00:56:48,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it will.

943
00:56:49,047 --> 00:56:49,488
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

944
00:56:49,528 --> 00:56:52,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Commodore 64 gaming is still not dead in many ways.

945
00:56:52,908 --> 00:56:55,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mac gaming will never die either.

946
00:56:56,449 --> 00:56:58,189
[SPEAKER_09]: There's rabid fans for everything.

947
00:56:58,209 --> 00:57:01,630
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think the dual boot thing is going to take off right away.

948
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:02,851
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a little while.

949
00:57:03,411 --> 00:57:04,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there will still be some good stuff on Mac.

950
00:57:05,979 --> 00:57:12,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, with the switch to the Intel processor, I think actually porting games will make it a lot easier.

951
00:57:12,664 --> 00:57:15,527
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we're going to see more games on the Mac.

952
00:57:15,967 --> 00:57:17,468
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

953
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:19,590
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see what happens.

954
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:20,531
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope so.

955
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:21,492
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

956
00:57:21,912 --> 00:57:22,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else?

957
00:57:23,393 --> 00:57:24,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Sock?

958
00:57:24,754 --> 00:57:25,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep up the good work.

959
00:57:26,175 --> 00:57:26,516
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

960
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:27,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

961
00:57:27,837 --> 00:57:29,538
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate the ego boost call once in a while.

962
00:57:30,118 --> 00:57:30,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

963
00:57:30,459 --> 00:57:30,639
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

964
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:31,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one.

965
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:32,881
[SPEAKER_09]: We like new people.

966
00:57:33,301 --> 00:57:34,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Love it when new people call on the show.

967
00:57:35,384 --> 00:57:37,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go to another call here.

968
00:57:37,064 --> 00:57:38,585
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go over here.

969
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

970
00:57:41,605 --> 00:57:42,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up?

971
00:57:42,465 --> 00:57:43,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, who's this?

972
00:57:43,825 --> 00:57:45,526
[SPEAKER_04]: This is HitStun.

973
00:57:45,646 --> 00:57:46,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, HitStun, what's on your mind?

974
00:57:46,966 --> 00:57:47,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

975
00:57:47,926 --> 00:57:50,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I got a couple things I wanted to go over here.

976
00:57:50,287 --> 00:57:50,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

977
00:57:50,627 --> 00:57:51,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to throw out an idea.

978
00:57:52,947 --> 00:58:01,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed earlier today, well, earlier this week, about how Walmart dictates the contents of games.

979
00:58:01,128 --> 00:58:04,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I posted this up on, well, I saw this posted on the forums, too.

980
00:58:05,011 --> 00:58:27,485
[SPEAKER_09]: But like, they can dictate things like... It's cool, I know what article you're talking about, and for some reason it didn't make this week's show roll, but I do remember reading something on it, like Walmart is, when a AA title comes out, Walmart supposedly gets to review the title before it's released.

981
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:34,689
[SPEAKER_09]: You know why I don't... I think one reason we kind of didn't originally intend on covering it is because I don't know if I believe it.

982
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:37,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, well, I can explain some.

983
00:58:37,854 --> 00:58:38,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, go for it.

984
00:58:39,314 --> 00:58:40,955
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like they only have so much shelf space.

985
00:58:41,295 --> 00:58:46,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they only have room for so many adventure games, so many RPGs, you know, so many strategy games, whatever.

986
00:58:46,816 --> 00:58:49,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And if something isn't popular enough, they're not going to have the room to carry it.

987
00:58:50,858 --> 00:58:52,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I had an idea.

988
00:58:52,718 --> 00:58:55,579
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be an independent publisher that's like Cafe Press.

989
00:58:55,619 --> 00:59:00,141
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how Cafe Press does, like, t-shirts and coffee mugs and stuff for whoever.

990
00:59:00,441 --> 00:59:01,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

991
00:59:01,721 --> 00:59:02,101
[SPEAKER_04]: They make it.

992
00:59:03,162 --> 00:59:04,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone should do that for video games.

993
00:59:05,404 --> 00:59:06,085
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my idea.

994
00:59:06,806 --> 00:59:07,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Stamp your video game on a 360?

995
00:59:07,807 --> 00:59:10,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

996
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:16,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone who wants to publish their game should be able to send it to this company and have people order it from the site and get copies of it.

997
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'd blow this whole thing wide open.

998
00:59:19,372 --> 00:59:19,752
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

999
00:59:38,795 --> 00:59:39,876
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about that baby.

1000
00:59:39,936 --> 00:59:42,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have my old Zack Bimani t-shirt.

1001
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:44,741
[SPEAKER_09]: You must hand wash that baby or something.

1002
00:59:44,901 --> 00:59:46,363
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I run it through the washer.

1003
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:46,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, take care of that.

1004
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:50,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Here is why Walmart, you know, how they dictate games.

1005
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:52,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so you have this game coming out called Halo 3.

1006
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:53,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1007
00:59:54,211 --> 00:59:56,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it have hunting deer in it?

1008
00:59:57,534 --> 00:59:58,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it doesn't.

1009
00:59:58,896 --> 00:59:59,737
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want to carry it.

1010
01:00:01,786 --> 01:00:09,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't buy music at Walmart because I don't agree with their... I really don't shop at Walmart in general because I'm such a Target whore for one.

1011
01:00:09,631 --> 01:00:11,433
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just think Walmart is nasty.

1012
01:00:11,573 --> 01:00:15,135
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know about the Walmarts in your neck of the woods, but around here, they are nasty.

1013
01:00:15,555 --> 01:00:17,396
[SPEAKER_09]: You walk in and it smells like dirt.

1014
01:00:17,757 --> 01:00:20,899
[SPEAKER_03]: When you live in Alabama, Walmart's the primary source of entertainment.

1015
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:22,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1016
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that in some areas, Walmart's your only option.

1017
01:00:25,682 --> 01:00:26,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not joking.

1018
01:00:26,562 --> 01:00:27,563
[SPEAKER_04]: But you guys have online.

1019
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:29,484
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got some nice independent stores here.

1020
01:00:29,944 --> 01:00:30,205
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1021
01:00:30,225 --> 01:00:30,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's good.

1022
01:00:32,188 --> 01:00:37,212
[SPEAKER_04]: And one more thing, I need to pwn you guys a Tetris DS.

1023
01:00:37,772 --> 01:00:45,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Any of you who have Tetris DS, like, listen in the chat, or, I know Sky, you got it, I gotta take you out.

1024
01:00:45,658 --> 01:00:49,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's plan it some way, make a thread in the forums, and we'll plan a night, alright?

1025
01:00:49,882 --> 01:00:55,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, eh, whatever, I'm not, like, unbeatable or anything, but

1026
01:00:56,631 --> 01:00:58,032
[SPEAKER_04]: and I gotta take you guys out.

1027
01:00:58,352 --> 01:00:58,873
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

1028
01:00:58,913 --> 01:01:02,735
[SPEAKER_09]: We like to show our listeners just how bad at video games we really are.

1029
01:01:03,776 --> 01:01:06,437
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know you guys can turn around and kill me at Mario Kart.

1030
01:01:06,778 --> 01:01:08,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll dish it out at some point.

1031
01:01:08,919 --> 01:01:09,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Start a thread in the forums.

1032
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,580
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll try to make it happen.

1033
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:12,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, thanks guys.

1034
01:01:12,682 --> 01:01:13,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one, buddy.

1035
01:01:13,762 --> 01:01:14,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, later.

1036
01:01:14,443 --> 01:01:14,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

1037
01:01:15,123 --> 01:01:15,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

1038
01:01:15,944 --> 01:01:18,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma Sani heard my accent.

1039
01:01:19,306 --> 01:01:21,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have an accent since I moved to California.

1040
01:01:21,267 --> 01:01:22,968
[SPEAKER_09]: And talking about Walmart nonetheless.

1041
01:01:23,008 --> 01:01:23,388
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wonderful.

1042
01:01:23,408 --> 01:01:23,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Walmart.

1043
01:01:24,795 --> 01:01:25,135
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1044
01:01:25,835 --> 01:01:28,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys so much for calling in on the Skype line tonight.

1045
01:01:28,096 --> 01:01:31,057
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate it, but we've got to get to the last-minute stories.

1046
01:01:31,117 --> 01:01:33,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody have a last-minute story they'd like to share?

1047
01:01:33,778 --> 01:01:38,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Project Gotham 3 is getting an update on Xbox Live.

1048
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:47,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Basic stuff that they're going to be adding, one of them is the ability to lock the host car in a host car class.

1049
01:01:49,023 --> 01:01:51,504
[SPEAKER_07]: So, again, just what kind of car class you're racing as.

1050
01:01:52,224 --> 01:01:52,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Also...

1051
01:01:53,351 --> 01:02:01,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Added wheel support for some of these brand new steering wheels out there being put out by Madcatz and stuff like that.

1052
01:02:01,837 --> 01:02:07,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, finally, they're going to be doing spectator mode.

1053
01:02:10,803 --> 01:02:11,283
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that.

1054
01:02:11,983 --> 01:02:13,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Fear is coming to the 360.

1055
01:02:13,424 --> 01:02:15,226
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be shown at E3.

1056
01:02:15,266 --> 01:02:17,767
[SPEAKER_07]: That's supposed to be the story I think 1UP was talking about.

1057
01:02:17,787 --> 01:02:18,748
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be

1058
01:02:19,298 --> 01:02:20,320
[SPEAKER_07]: PC Games 360 Liberty City Stories

1059
01:02:33,945 --> 01:02:36,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that's not true because that game's awesome.

1060
01:02:38,246 --> 01:02:42,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it has online multiplayer because I'm going to fucking kick everybody's ass.

1061
01:02:43,247 --> 01:02:43,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's ass.

1062
01:02:44,187 --> 01:02:46,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember one of the videos that we had of me drunk.

1063
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:50,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, how about a game of Grand Theft Auto right now?

1064
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:53,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I'll fucking kick your ass, even if I am drunk.

1065
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:54,549
[SPEAKER_07]: That was fun.

1066
01:02:55,489 --> 01:02:56,009
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura?

1067
01:02:57,209 --> 01:02:59,610
[SPEAKER_03]: There were 5,400 World of Warcraft players banned.

1068
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh, what did they do?

1069
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:06,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they were trying to clamp down on gold farming and cheating.

1070
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:10,258
[SPEAKER_03]: And funeral party raiding.

1071
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:20,122
[SPEAKER_03]: 10,700 accounts were suspended for participating in activities that violate the game's terms of use, including using third-party programs to farm gold and items.

1072
01:03:20,682 --> 01:03:26,985
[SPEAKER_03]: According to Blizzard, and I quote, such actions can severely impact the economy of a realm and the overall game enjoyment for all players.

1073
01:03:27,543 --> 01:03:32,806
[SPEAKER_03]: and selling World of Warcraft content such as gold items and characters can result in permanent ban of the involved accounts.

1074
01:03:32,826 --> 01:03:36,067
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to cheat like that, you better go play Oblivion.

1075
01:03:36,467 --> 01:03:41,470
[SPEAKER_03]: However, a new patch, 1.10.1, is released.

1076
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:52,115
[SPEAKER_03]: The Jagged Obsidian Shield is now bind-on equipped, and the Titanic Leggings pattern will now drop slightly less frequently, which is obviously, you know, it's going to...

1077
01:03:53,442 --> 01:03:54,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1078
01:04:19,877 --> 01:04:20,918
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit more news.

1079
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:25,941
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.11 is coming out soon, which is basically mage-specific.

1080
01:04:25,982 --> 01:04:27,302
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be a talent review.

1081
01:04:28,703 --> 01:04:40,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Patch is going to introduce a new 40-man raid dungeon, the Necropolis of Naxxramas, which is home to the Dreaded Lich, unpronounceable name insert here.

1082
01:04:42,473 --> 01:04:42,733
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1083
01:04:43,567 --> 01:04:44,908
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a little bit more.

1084
01:04:44,928 --> 01:04:47,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom's going to be loading us with stuff at E3.

1085
01:04:48,572 --> 01:04:49,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1086
01:04:49,432 --> 01:04:50,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate Firefox all of a sudden.

1087
01:04:51,174 --> 01:04:51,574
[SPEAKER_09]: What did it do?

1088
01:04:51,594 --> 01:04:52,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Crash on you?

1089
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:52,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

1090
01:04:52,896 --> 01:04:53,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no!

1091
01:04:53,736 --> 01:04:54,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see if I can get around this.

1092
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just go ahead and leave it off of there.

1093
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I can do a fill-in real quick if you get to bring it up.

1094
01:05:00,523 --> 01:05:02,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, I'm not even going to play with it.

1095
01:05:02,845 --> 01:05:03,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1096
01:05:04,042 --> 01:05:09,703
[SPEAKER_09]: GoNintendo has an interesting little quote from Ubisoft Montreal CEO's Yanis Mallet.

1097
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:16,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I can say definitely as any other developer, we are looking at this magical platform and we want to be a part of the adventure.

1098
01:05:17,045 --> 01:05:22,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure we'll see other Revolution games from Ubisoft and some of them I'm sure will be made from Montreal.

1099
01:05:22,746 --> 01:05:27,647
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's quoting there that the Revolution is a magical platform.

1100
01:05:27,707 --> 01:05:30,007
[SPEAKER_09]: It's full of magic.

1101
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:33,128
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're going to make magic games.

1102
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:38,348
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1103
01:06:04,005 --> 01:06:04,345
[SPEAKER_09]: and Spike.

1104
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:06,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Die, monster.

1105
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:08,309
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't belong in this world.

1106
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:12,173
[SPEAKER_03]: And... It was not by my hand that I was given flesh.

1107
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:12,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerds!

1108
01:06:14,315 --> 01:06:14,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Nerds!

1109
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:16,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1110
01:06:18,258 --> 01:06:21,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Well... Ooh, video.

1111
01:06:22,762 --> 01:06:25,605
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to... I'm really trying to get this on the website.

1112
01:06:26,085 --> 01:06:26,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1113
01:06:27,046 --> 01:06:28,548
[SPEAKER_09]: You do that, Mr. Loki.

1114
01:06:29,335 --> 01:06:32,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

1115
01:06:32,717 --> 01:06:39,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys so much for downloading us, checking us out, tuning in live, breaking some record numbers for us listening live tonight.

1116
01:06:39,742 --> 01:06:41,823
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate that, you guys.

1117
01:06:42,383 --> 01:06:45,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, all we ask, if you enjoy the show, we do it for free.

1118
01:06:45,445 --> 01:06:46,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Just tell a friend.

1119
01:06:46,405 --> 01:06:56,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell somebody you know about Orange Lounge Radio because that's really the best way for us to advertise because we don't have any big sites backing us and we don't have those ads and things.

1120
01:06:56,609 --> 01:07:01,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So unless Loki can manage to leak some more release dates, we don't get attention very often.

1121
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,311
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need you guys to help us out.

1122
01:07:04,791 --> 01:07:05,251
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura?

1123
01:07:06,172 --> 01:07:06,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost forgot.

1124
01:07:06,912 --> 01:07:07,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject false icons.

1125
01:07:07,872 --> 01:07:08,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there you go.

1126
01:07:09,053 --> 01:07:10,693
[SPEAKER_09]: And on that note, that's going to do it.

1127
01:07:10,973 --> 01:07:11,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good week.

1128
01:07:11,714 --> 01:07:13,074
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1129
01:07:16,812 --> 01:07:19,235
