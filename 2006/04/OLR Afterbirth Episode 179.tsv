70097	75881	Thanks for watching!
98949	99710	Thanks for watching!
130206	131687	Thank you for watching!
167640	168441	Thanks for watching!
194652	195915	Thanks for watching!
213581	218262	Mention the fact that you nearly fell off the chair.
218482	220002	I don't know how I almost fell into the wall.
220042	223443	An extra person here talking about using it as a battery for your vibrator.
223463	224703	Let's talk about Wondershowsin.
224743	226243	Oh yeah, let's talk about Wondershowsin.
226403	228624	I just took over the show.
228744	230704	How about that?
230804	232324	Wondershowsin is awesome.
234925	235985	Are you Wondershowsin?
236565	238325	Then you're so awesome.
238905	239806	Like a hot dog.
241126	241886	I don't think you're cool.
244304	248127	Sorry, not as cool as Wondershoes, which is your fairly hot.
248408	252571	I am moderately hot.
256595	263300	So anyway... Hey everybody, I just took over the show.
263341	264241	How's about that?
264261	268385	I think everybody should tell me how cool I am.
268485	269146	You start.
269686	271508	I'm not going to do this again.
273094	275154	Oh, that was great.
275935	278195	I love the kid that was dressed up like Hitler.
278355	282536	Trevor is the best beat kid on that show.
282556	283796	Thank you for returning, Rob.
283816	285116	I like the kid about pills, though.
285136	286557	He's my favorite.
286637	287137	Pills!
287217	287717	Pills!
287817	288317	Pills!
289057	289457	Shut up.
289717	293738	I think the power brick should be bigger than the PSP.
293838	297939	It should be like a 360 or an Xbox that you just slap to the back of the PSP.
298407	299888	That should be a nuclear generator.
300489	303092	Like the power packs in Ghostbusters.
304974	306695	Power bricks made out of solid metal.
306795	309858	It just gets super hot and you can cook eggs on it.
310719	311360	Mmm, eggs.
312161	313262	Mmm, eggy.
315506	315946	Hello?
316727	317748	Hello, is this thing on?
317788	318309	Testing.
319490	320351	Testing 1-2.
320931	324875	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
324975	325456	Hello?
326117	327578	I don't understand this.
328259	328959	Does this thing work?
328979	330561	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
330641	331282	Is this on?
331302	331862	What the hell?
334405	338189	Orange Lounge Radio, Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
338269	338589	What the?
340333	341334	That's one of our old promos.
341654	342074	Gotta love that.
342274	343215	Oh, RetroOLR.
343775	344536	I missed the beep.
344596	346937	The beep was from R10K.
347017	349138	Alright, alright.
349258	349759	No, for reals.
349819	351780	We gotta get through this or I swear to God we'll be here all night.
351820	352280	Alright, here we go.
353201	354081	I thought that was QQQ.
354201	355502	Alright, shut up.
355682	356403	Everybody, shut up.
356963	357403	It's my time.
358024	360205	Loki has this look at, you're gonna fuck up.
360405	361626	You're gonna fuck up.
363487	364428	And then I fucked up.
365566	367107	I wasn't doing anything.
367127	368207	You were giving me that look.
368247	370308	You were like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
371229	372309	I'm not doing anything.
373409	374530	You willed it to happen.
376491	377931	I was just watching him talk.
378812	380613	I swear to God I quit.
380733	380993	All right.
382393	384054	Woo-hoo, we have DarkSakura Radio.
384254	384955	All right, no, we don't.
385035	385895	All right, here we go.
390342	391583	I was not even looking at you.
391603	393384	Alright, you know what?
393685	394985	Fuckin' A. I'm turning around.
397527	398508	I'm turning around.
398528	399509	Dude.
401806	403767	Why do we have you on this program anyway?
403927	409270	Okay, this is you talking.
409330	410451	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
411311	412232	Here's DarkSakura.
412752	413512	Right at you.
413833	417915	She's like, how am I not supposed to laugh at that?
417955	421977	For the sake of the chat room, I was leaning over my laptop, staring at Rob intently.
422917	424178	I don't want to be a duck.
426693	428334	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
428354	429815	This is not a drunk show.
429956	430756	Stop filming.
431597	435780	I'm going to turn around and not look at you people so I can get through this segment.
435820	438662	So, Loki, be ready with a Tomb Raider story and no more giggling.
438862	440103	Yeah, we have a Tomb Raider story.
440143	440624	Alright, here we go.
443326	443666	Okay.
444206	444867	Seriously.
445027	445547	Jesus.
445708	445988	Alright.
446708	448410	Know how Bobby Black by himself.
449050	450711	I'm starting to wonder if that's not a bad idea.
450731	451412	I'm pushing your head.
454214	454494	Alright.
455035	455355	Here we go.
478615	480876	And we're back here with the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth.
480936	483638	It's that portion of the show that's too hot to podcast.
483798	484618	It's sticky.
484879	486259	It's perverted.
488481	493503	We have the cage match coming up, which is pretty much going to be just about all we do tonight because we're already at 9 o'clock.
493543	495004	That was an awfully long show tonight.
495805	498406	Maybe if you would quit laughing so much during the show.
498426	498866	That's true.
498906	500387	It's not the show itself.
500527	502929	When it comes out on the stream, don't stop it.
504589	508170	When it comes out on the podcast stream, it won't be very long, but it was like 20 minutes of giggle fits.
508350	508971	That's alright.
509091	512292	I recorded it on my fancy video camera.
512392	512912	Okay, what is it?
513952	515453	Are we going to do a video cast then?
515773	517934	Is that the next step?
518014	518174	No.
518574	521175	We don't have to, but this is mainly for E3.
521195	522035	Get me a burka then.
522395	529388	Because as we know, we were talking about what we're doing, our plans for E3, special plans that no one's doing yet.
529688	535579	That's mainly what it's for, so I can walk through the entire booth and cover everything and that kind of stuff.
536707	537747	I love that video camera.
537767	542428	The only problem is the still pictures it takes aren't 100% good.
542608	546229	They're like 640x480, not really even a 1 megapixel.
546849	553171	But when I figured I'm cropping down most of the pictures anyways, I don't think it really matters.
554171	554971	So, I don't know.
557172	558612	But it'll be pretty cool.
561727	566969	In random news, it's Bomani related, Sephiroth1215 sent me a private message in chat.
566989	568069	I hope you don't mind me sharing that.
568089	570630	But he sent me a link over to Konami's website here.
571090	573711	And Konami has a page here for DDR Supernova.
574172	576192	And it says, release date, available now.
577473	578233	Lies.
578553	581054	I think there's a webmaster at Konami that's about to get fired.
581274	581714	Hooray.
581814	583315	Why don't you email somebody about that?
583355	584415	Why would I email anybody about that?
584435	585336	Can't you fix that?
585376	586076	You work for him?
586196	588097	Can't you fire somebody?
588937	589257	All right.
591551	594814	I sent you a link to my Flash thingy and you never said anything.
595214	595515	When?
596095	598477	I sent you an IM a few days ago.
599538	600399	Was I at work?
600779	601860	That's because he's rude.
602280	602541	What?
602801	604522	And I leave my IM up.
604542	606544	I'm going to pull it up and I'm going to show you on my laptop.
606584	609026	Well, you know you need to friend me now once you get a game.
610307	611428	Once I get a game.
611969	612849	You don't even have to get a game.
612909	616272	Buy some of those Xbox Live arcade games.
616392	617914	I'll probably get Geometry Wars.
619266	621747	Didn't you download the ghost recon thing or something?
621767	622808	Hold on, I'm busy.
623208	623949	Talk to me later.
626910	630472	I was going to do a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, but I don't think I really care about these people anymore.
631093	636036	So, let's get into tonight's cage match, shall we?
636756	637797	Okay, what were you talking about?
637857	638537	Now I'm not busy.
638817	641879	I'm going to put that on my resume and I want you to have people hire me.
643328	643588	All right.
674212	674995	Cache Match!
676660	677483	I vote for Holic.
678246	678928	I'm gonna get busted.
678948	680293	Three songs, do battle.
682006	685028	and now I have the giggles again.
685808	686989	Three songs do battle.
687049	688870	Each host picks their favorite song.
688890	689671	Hey, Cage Match.
690011	690351	Fine.
690531	692532	Three hosts pick their favorite song.
692552	693113	They do battle.
693153	695254	Your guys' votes in the chat room determine the winner.
695774	701177	And it goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music program.
701457	704139	Started off with song number one, which won the Cage Match last week.
704179	704959	It was Babyland.
705420	705660	Yes?
706160	709202	Yes, Babyland, who I'm going to see on April 15th in Berkeley.
709762	713923	Alright, Babyland had this song called Gary?
714143	715283	Is that how you say it?
715363	715683	Gary?
715803	716563	Gary, Gary.
717044	720464	Alright, well it won last week's Cage Match with its funky indie sound.
720884	723885	I think I said it sounded like the Postal Service on crack or something, I don't remember.
724165	724545	But here it is.
724565	728546	A lot of their stuff is more industrial sounding, but this I thought was very synth poppy.
728786	729366	Alright, here it is.
729906	730506	Have a good one.
731066	732647	Song number one, Babyland.
732907	733167	Enjoy.
742588	743576	Thank you for watching!
790618	791442	Thanks for watching!
826778	830164	Alright, song number two in tonight's cage match is coming up.
830284	833750	That, once again, was song number one, Babyland, with Jerry.
834752	839360	And song number two is going to be a challenger, and it's my pick.
840350	841951	And it's a band called Goldfrap.
842532	844273	Actually, I think Goldfrap is just the name of the girl.
845434	846955	You know she's got a lot of people helping her out.
847495	850838	Goldfrap has a song from her new CD, Supernature is the CD.
851218	852759	The song is called Ooh La La.
853459	854460	And I like this song.
854800	856041	It's kind of pornotastic.
856061	857002	So it's my pick tonight.
857342	858803	Ooh La La by Goldfrap.
858943	859344	Enjoy.
859704	860084	Or don't.
860124	860685	See if I care.
868851	869491	Ooh La La
893611	898193	I want to touch you, you're just made for love
976688	978212	Thanks for watching!
1020459	1022020	That was it, that was uh...
1049867	1053089	Song number two there in the cage match, Ooh La La by GoldFrap.
1053930	1055591	I love that ending, though.
1055731	1059214	Yeah, you know what, that was part of a song I'm not supposed to be playing.
1059234	1064278	Whoops!
1064338	1069422	Anyway, what did you guys think of Ooh La La by GoldFrap?
1070442	1072924	Miklatov, she needs to quit smoking, one.
1075060	1077542	Loki, what did you think of Oolala by GoldPrap?
1078022	1080804	I recognized... I don't know, it was okay.
1081084	1082986	It's good stripper music, I guess.
1084367	1085848	It should be called GoldFap.
1089030	1089710	I guess it would be like 7.5.
1092072	1093694	Jamie, how would you rate the bathroom?
1094094	1094975	Or wherever you just were.
1095035	1097317	I could hear the music from the bathroom, thank you.
1097337	1098138	What did you like?
1098838	1099419	It was poopy.
1100300	1102462	No, I'm kidding.
1102922	1105124	I actually liked what I heard of it.
1105344	1108507	It was a little repetitive, but it gets an 8.
1108667	1110889	That is totally fucking music.
1111710	1112110	I give it a 9.
1114341	1116082	Oh shit, I forgot kids listen to this show, my bad.
1116563	1120126	Alright, song number three tonight comes from Cheater Loki.
1120586	1122428	Cheater, Cheater, Cheater Loki.
1122848	1123488	Hey, listen.
1123749	1125550	Do not support Cheater Loki tonight.
1125610	1128913	Listen, I did the same thing when Kingdom Hearts 1 came out, okay?
1128953	1135118	So obviously my choice is going to be Utada Hikaru with Passion, because that is a team song.
1137440	1139982	Alright, here's song number three from Cheating Loki.
1140442	1141923	Utada Hikaru with Passion.
1142404	1142644	Enjoy.
1157251	1158154	Thank you for watching!
1193937	1196039	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1251844	1252966	Thank you for watching!
1272954	1274295	Thank you for watching!
1301259	1302828	Thank you for watching!
1358468	1360135	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1423919	1427061	Alright, song number three tonight, Utada Hikaru with Passion.
1427081	1428902	Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that.
1428962	1429842	Who started us off last time?
1429862	1430443	Miklatov.
1431203	1433424	It was long and had bad camera angles.
1433484	1434245	It's a one.
1435225	1435646	Loki.
1435666	1438267	I love that song.
1438707	1440008	I love the guitar.
1440228	1443130	That's the only thing I remember of it each time.
1444371	1447953	Yet you used the version without the guitar bridge in the middle, like in the opening video.
1448424	1448864	You know what?
1448944	1450686	I was pressed for time.
1450806	1452247	Yeah, I had a feeling.
1453268	1453788	I had a hunch.
1455669	1456350	DarkSakura.
1456370	1457671	Oh, I'm sorry.
1458532	1459092	I gave it a 9.
1460153	1460713	DarkSakura.
1460893	1470380	I really like this song, although as far as I thought that Hikaru was better as far as an opening song.
1471381	1471541	This...
1473931	1478352	You know, I really like the song, it's a problem, but I just don't like things about it.
1478852	1480093	So it gets a 7.
1481813	1485134	I think the opening song to Kingdom Hearts 2 should have been Easy Breezy.
1485534	1487154	Because I think that would have been much better.
1487294	1489175	Come on, you could have like Sora skipping down.
1489435	1491636	It's not as dramatic.
1492036	1492676	Alright, no, I...
1494045	1498789	I like that song a lot, but it's already in rotation, so I give it a five.
1499229	1502012	Alright, don't get me wrong, I love that song, but Loki sucks.
1502092	1505575	Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.
1506736	1510679	Babyland with Jerry, song number one.
1520959	1527727	Alright, and song number two you can vote for tonight is Gold Frap with Ooh La La is the name of that song.
1536456	1542183	Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is from Loki, and it's Utada Hikaru with Passion.
1545572	1545952	I wasn't listening.
1574721	1576363	DarkSakura has a memory like an elephant.
1576863	1579406	She don't forget.
1580607	1581668	It's a slightly different version.
1581688	1583309	What are you talking about?
1583329	1583930	You don't forget.
1586873	1587293	Shut up.
1588134	1590356	I think the one we have in rotation does have the guitar riff.
1590396	1591757	I think it's the one from the movie.
1591898	1592979	It's the short one.
1592999	1593219	Sigh.
1596135	1596415	All right.
1596475	1601378	And, dude, I'm going to hit FoodManiac64 with a trout now for being a butt.
1601398	1601978	All right.
1602018	1602358	Do so.
1602879	1606460	Because he told everyone not to vote for my song so they'd play his.
1606861	1608942	But I haven't guaranteed that I'll play his song.
1608962	1609162	Uh-huh.
1609222	1612504	Yeah, I told people I'd play their songs like three months ago, and I still haven't.
1612644	1614085	Just keep dangling out there.
1614105	1615385	He emailed me four times.
1615725	1616286	Tell him to stop.
1616526	1617026	Block him.
1618567	1618747	Ah.
1620208	1620608	All right.
1621810	1626774	Uh, since I need some time here to tabulate votes, I need filler, so we're gonna go around and do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.
1626914	1628315	DarkSakura, how was your week, how was your day?
1628695	1629116	Shitty!
1629556	1630176	I mean, poopy.
1632478	1634039	No, my week was actually pretty good.
1634059	1635000	I've got more stuff to do.
1635220	1643226	You know, my whole crappy work situation has improved to such a degree that I no longer feel like I'm going to kill people and then myself in a big emo fit.
1643846	1648890	Instead, I just feel like, you know, I'm going to mildly maim people and, you know, not, like, actually kill them, you know.
1650273	1651454	I'm no longer disgruntled.
1652034	1653674	I'm slightly annoyed, but not disgruntled.
1656276	1658717	I've also been playing a lot of Ragnarok online.
1659957	1663619	As of today, my primary character is 5441.
1663839	1670561	I still have to get job 50 before I can go assassin.
1670581	1674063	I donated some money to their server, so I got a bunch of free stuff for it.
1674103	1676524	I have a kiddie band now, and it makes me a very happy bunny.
1681540	1682360	I have a kitty band.
1684081	1684941	I need to see pictures.
1686001	1686761	I will send you pictures.
1687442	1688642	And I got a bunch of cards too.
1688702	1691703	I have a thief bug card and no footwear that I can put it on.
1693803	1694824	And now I need a zombie card.
1697504	1698705	Because zombies are awesome.
1699065	1699665	Like a hot dog.
1702226	1703026	Loki, how was your week?
1703046	1703366	How was your day?
1704412	1705773	My weekend day was okay.
1706374	1715523	I've got to move my desk tomorrow because we do this thing every once in a while once we fire a bunch of people where we do the floor layout shuffle.
1716544	1717485	Those are fun.
1718346	1720108	Yeah, for no apparent reason.
1721490	1724873	They'll move people one desk over just...
1725774	1726635	for the hell of it.
1726876	1727857	And it's kind of fun.
1728158	1729981	But anyway, so I gotta move my desk.
1730021	1736410	And I get my review next week, which should be interesting because my phone time sucks, but I'm the smartest one there.
1736671	1738894	So, you know, it kind of evens out.
1739495	1739996	And, um...
1741550	1741850	I don't know.
1742010	1742571	It'll be cool.
1742751	1743972	We're supposed to be getting our bonuses.
1745213	1751979	My co-worker taught me this really cool thing with our bonus because they take out twice the amount of taxes as they normally would on your bonus checks.
1752039	1757243	So where I potentially could get $2,000, I only get like $1,100 or something.
1757703	1762987	So what you do is you put out another W4 or whatever for...
1765322	1770245	You know, exempt for that week, so I get my full $2,000, which is going to a laptop.
1770565	1774407	And, um... What else?
1774487	1778390	Oh yeah, I got my spiffy camera, which you'll hopefully see some more content for the PSP site.
1778650	1787075	That's what the, uh... One of the main reasons was for that, so I can record some of my stuff at, you know... Well, I'm probably going to record stuff at my bachelor party, because...
1788373	1790654	What happens at Bachelor Party stays at Bachelor Party.
1791635	1795317	And also... Do you know what they have planned for your Bachelor Party?
1795377	1796557	No, I don't.
1797998	1799599	I do, but that's all I can say.
1799839	1800099	Okay.
1800899	1805422	Anyways, the other thing is just your recording wedding stuff.
1805962	1810524	Just it's really fun to play with that camera because it has a 20 gig hard drive in there so you can store tons of video.
1811285	1813506	Lots of video coming from E3, that's for sure.
1813666	1815967	So look forward to that and lots of pictures.
1817108	1817268	And...
1819164	1820448	Yeah, I think that's about all I have.
1821652	1822355	Mikotov, how was your week?
1823396	1824637	My week was boring.
1824937	1826058	Work is boring.
1826358	1827119	I'm sick of it.
1827959	1836865	And then today, slash last night, got myself hyped up to go to Best Buy and wait in a non-existent line at 3 in the morning.
1837606	1838927	That didn't go so well.
1840168	1841148	Best Buy sucks.
1841889	1850035	And then tomorrow, somebody new that we hired is going to be sitting in my office and I'm not looking forward to that because I hate new people and I will not talk to them.
1852088	1853009	You're not a team player.
1853489	1855190	I don't need to be a team player.
1855650	1857131	They invaded my space.
1857671	1858471	They can go away.
1859832	1864735	And, uh, I, um... Oh, we started playing Tetris DS at work.
1865295	1866555	And it's over already.
1866776	1869777	Because a lot of people suck and whine too much like me.
1869857	1870958	Back to Apples and Apples.
1871298	1872879	Apples to Apples is occasionally played.
1873099	1876841	We recently discovered the joy of Team Mario Kart.
1877701	1878161	at break.
1878601	1879141	That's really fun.
1879161	1879882	Team Mario Kart.
1879902	1881102	Yeah, and reverses.
1881382	1886403	When you're setting up the options like 150 and computer difficulty if you have computers and all that, there's an option for team.
1886983	1889324	And so you can actually do a four-on-four team.
1890204	1901527	And it's pretty much like a regular race, except you have a color icon, like red or blue, and you can still attack your own teammates, but how it works is it's an overall point total for your team.
1901967	1902387	That's kind of cool.
1902407	1904607	You're no longer working just to be the best.
1904888	1905868	You're working as a team.
1905968	1906148	So...
1907267	1912750	We started out last week when the losers were still playing Tetris, me and the person in my room, or in my office.
1913431	1923557	We played it with computers and he got screwed over twice with really bad computer players, but it's really fun actually, and I didn't even think Mario Kart could be more fun than it already was.
1923857	1924958	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1940937	1946401	So now we're playing without power-ups because, you know, they got pissed off at that because I won the rankings this month.
1947061	1954486	So this next month now, we're just trying to... I want to do team games, but the problem is we don't get enough people to participate.
1954506	1959810	You can only do six, and some people are gone or busy and stuff, and that kind of makes it unfair.
1959870	1965173	But, I don't know, we're looking forward to, like, maybe Liberty City Stories when it comes out on PlayStation 2.
1965373	1969997	Hopefully we'll have multiplayer, and then we can land together some PS2s and play it that way.
1970797	1971177	I don't know.
1972057	1972478	Might be fun.
1972498	1973058	That could be fun.
1974998	1976579	Rob, how was your weekend?
1976879	1977499	It was fine.
1978420	1980240	Besides the whole male PMS thing, I was fine.
1980260	1980860	I had a fine week.
1981921	1987343	I went to the gym today and my trainer pretty much told me officially today that I'm fat, which was good to hear.
1989517	1990638	That's what I was referring to.
1990658	1993161	No, I had to take the little machine that measures your body fat.
1993882	1995463	And you hold it in your hands like away from your body.
1995483	1996024	Yeah, exactly.
1996084	1997385	And it did the little boop, boop, boop thing.
1997405	1998086	The BMI scale.
1998126	1998907	Yep, and then I turned it.
1999107	2001310	Yep, and he looked at the number and then he turned it around and said.
2001997	2004019	Yep, you're right here in the high one.
2004039	2005259	I'm like, thanks.
2005840	2006320	But oh well.
2006821	2008462	I mean, I already knew that was coming anyway.
2008502	2011144	That's the whole reason I signed up for the gym.
2011224	2014726	So I just have to make sure I go regularly.
2014827	2016328	That's pretty cool that you have a trainer, though.
2016348	2017949	That would be the only thing I'd be able to do.
2018509	2020150	Well, I only get them one more time for free.
2020431	2021852	Then I'd have to pay for them if I want to keep them.
2021872	2024714	Rob, if you come to my gym with me, I'll work out with you and show you what to do.
2025074	2031658	It's not that I don't know what to do, I just, you know, I need the motivation is a huge thing.
2031778	2033339	Put a cupcake in front of you.
2035546	2039628	I promise you, next Monday, nothing will stand in between us going to spin.
2039708	2040008	All right.
2040828	2041128	Word.
2041208	2043109	You know, they do spin at this gym, too.
2043349	2045490	But you have to go to my trainer's spin.
2045870	2047731	She's vicious.
2047751	2051472	I asked my trainer if you could come to this club, and he said with a guest pass you can.
2052113	2054754	So you'll have to come to one of our classes sometime, see if you enjoy it.
2054954	2055674	All right.
2055714	2056314	Bring me a guest pass.
2056614	2056814	Okay.
2057395	2057755	You got it.
2057835	2058175	You're on.
2058835	2060096	And we'll pick a class to do.
2060396	2061816	And in the summer we can go swimming.
2061977	2062937	We can do yoga or something.
2063097	2064240	I got all the stuff to do lap swimming.
2069713	2070673	They're outdoors, though.
2070754	2072194	I thought it was indoors when I signed up.
2072334	2076555	One of the ones I have a membership for over here has a lap pool outside.
2076955	2077936	It's the snooty one, though.
2077976	2080116	We need to do the indoor pool somewhere.
2080136	2081216	Roseville.
2082137	2082897	I'm going to Roseville.
2082937	2085118	I think Roseville has three indoor pools.
2085678	2086598	Oh, hi.
2088278	2090019	Shall we announce who won tonight's cage match?
2090759	2092540	That would be a good way to get close to the end here.
2093120	2093420	Sure.
2093480	2096541	The winning song of tonight's cage match was...
2097441	2098422	A tie!
2099242	2102905	And here are the two songs... Okay, you know how ties work.
2102945	2104166	Here's song number one that tied.
2105367	2106047	Baby Man.
2109249	2110870	Here's song number two that tied.
2113972	2115894	Passion, Utada Hikaru.
2116754	2120477	And in the old Orange Lounge Radio rulebook... I wonder where this is going.
2120497	2124480	That means that when two songs tie, the host who got screwed over... Oh, that's me.
2124860	2126161	Gets to break the tie...
2127802	2130443	Now, see, I could be ironic and vote for your pick, Loki.
2131224	2132744	And then Jamie could hate me all night.
2133245	2133985	That might be fun.
2135866	2143709	But, no, I can't do that because, you know, you totally picked a song that was already in rotation, so I think you both end up winning anyway.
2144109	2151913	So I am picking for Jamie's song, I'm picking Jamie's song, Babyland, because I like the fact that they sound like Postal Service on track.
2153034	2154294	All right, so two weeks in a row.
2155535	2155935	All right.
2157748	2158889	Babyland for the win!
2159229	2160830	Two weeks in a row, not too shabby.
2161431	2163512	So everybody has to go to their show in Berkeley.
2163692	2165754	Now the stripper song was only one vote behind.
2166414	2167335	So it was close.
2167355	2168196	We were all up there.
2168776	2170077	We're all winners.
2170217	2171618	Except Rob's not as much of a winner.
2171658	2176362	It was one vote for Pat, that one song, one vote for Jamie's song, and zero votes for yours.
2177703	2178584	Yeah, something like that.
2179522	2181543	And that was both of our listeners right there.
2181783	2182203	Sweet.
2182423	2184744	Alright, it's about 9.30 and I think it's time to call it a night.
2184784	2185445	What do you kids think?
2185705	2186365	I want ice cream.
2186385	2187146	I'm thirsty.
2187206	2187826	I'm hungry.
2188566	2189507	I want a cupcake.
2192448	2194369	I think they're... No, I think I ate the last one.
2195850	2196390	Bastard!
2197390	2197830	No, it's fine.
2197870	2200111	I need... Oh, I want Boba.
2200292	2201532	That's 23rd Magus.
2201572	2202493	I hear you there.
2202893	2205294	Oh, you know, TAPEX is open.
2207107	2207548	Stop it!
2207708	2208489	Stop it, all of you!
2208749	2212032	I just got told I'm fat today!
2212212	2214694	We'll get you some nice wheatgrass.
2214714	2215815	I don't want wheatgrass.
2216535	2218036	I want bulimia right about now.
2218657	2219017	Alright.
2219418	2222360	Then fine, I'll get you a bottle of Ipecac.
2223641	2223981	Alright.
2224602	2225563	And a toothbrush.
2228785	2229886	That's disgusting.
2230687	2231868	You said you wanted bulimia.
2232318	2235761	Alright, sorry chat room, I ignored your FUs tonight, maybe next week.
2236501	2241505	Tonight was supposed to be a slow news night, we went on forever, but of course I think that little giggle fit had something to do with it.
2241545	2242145	Your giggle fit, okay Rob.
2242165	2242866	My giggle fit?
2242886	2245247	Yeah, you were the only one laughing in the microphone.
2245268	2246188	We were laughing at you.
2246248	2248270	I have your giggle fit on camera, so.
2248470	2249090	Alright, shut up.
2249110	2249511	Partial.
2249731	2250371	Alright, here it is.
2250892	2252052	Your fortune cookie message.
2252093	2254034	I almost said your moment of zen.
2254054	2255055	Your fortune cookie message.
2255075	2255995	Do you still want to be a duck?
2256396	2256956	Of the day.
2256976	2258017	I don't want to be a duck.
2261479	2281134	We're tiny, we're toony, we're all a little loony And in this cartoony, we're invading your TV We're comic dispensers, we crack up all the censors On I'm a Toon Adventures, get a dose of comedy So here's at the anchors, it's a whole wide world apart Our homes, we only stand alone, a cartoon work of art
2281534	2306632	The scripts were rejected, expect the unexpected On Tiny Toon Adventures, it's about to start They're furry, they're funny, they're fast and bustin' funny Montana Max has money, Elmira is a pain She's hefty and plucky, busy devil yucky Her balls are chunky, and Go-Go is insane At Acme University, we earned our Toon degree The teaching staff have been getting laughs since 1933
2308073	2316884	We're tiny, we're too neat, we're all a little moody It's Tiny Toon Adventures, come and join the fun And now our song is done
