2
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:26,186
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're back here live on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 180 for this April the 9th of 2006.

3
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:31,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki would like to begin this segment with a small correction, wouldn't you, Loki?

4
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I would.

5
00:00:32,651 --> 00:00:36,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, about those numbers about the Revolution launch titles, I was a little off.

6
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:36,994
[SPEAKER_09]: A little?

7
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:38,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was a bit off.

8
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:39,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

9
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:47,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, coming from Game Front, the true number is 20 titles, one-third of which are said to be developed by Nintendo themselves.

10
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:48,303
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

11
00:00:49,022 --> 00:00:49,562
[SPEAKER_09]: I was close.

12
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:52,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the number 20 in there and there's a percentage.

13
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:58,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Which means Orange Lounge Radio will be pudding free for those of you that listen to Part A. Thankfully.

14
00:00:59,405 --> 00:01:00,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray!

15
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:01,826
[SPEAKER_06]: My dignity is spared another day.

16
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:03,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Still better coverage than IGN.

17
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:06,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I say that?

18
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:07,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

19
00:01:08,147 --> 00:01:08,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

20
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:10,768
[SPEAKER_08]: You can address those cards and letters too.

21
00:01:10,808 --> 00:01:11,348
[SPEAKER_08]: What is your email?

22
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:12,789
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have an Orange Lounge Radio account, do you?

23
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:13,469
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get you one.

24
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:14,269
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get you one.

25
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:15,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Remind me to hook you up with one after the show.

26
00:01:15,669 --> 00:01:17,770
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll hook you up with a Spike at Orange Lounge Radio email.

27
00:01:18,564 --> 00:01:19,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take you up on that.

28
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:20,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, sounds good.

29
00:01:20,405 --> 00:01:24,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, did anybody notice in the first segment of tonight's show, not a single story on Sony PlayStation?

30
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:28,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Because everything's been quiet on the PS3 front this week, pretty much, hasn't it?

31
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:30,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

32
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:31,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there was one little thing, right, Loki?

33
00:01:32,748 --> 00:01:33,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

34
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:35,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see here.

35
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:49,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, according to some French radio show, there was an interview done where it was leaked out, I guess, that the PlayStation 3 would be somewhere between the price point of 499, 599 euros in the UK.

36
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:51,676
[SPEAKER_09]: So everyone's speculating, oh my god, it's going to be $650, $700 some dollars here.

37
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:54,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Not the case.

38
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:11,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, a lot of times the price point over there, they will get screwed over because their price point will be... For example, for the Xbox 360, I believe their price point is €399 for the premium system, whereas we were $399.

39
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:12,454
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe €499 to €599.

40
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:13,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking more about €499.

41
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:14,735
[SPEAKER_09]: That's probably going to be the price point in the U.S.

42
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:27,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I think $4.99 is a reasonable price point for the US too.

43
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:38,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was very interesting though because this news kind of came out early in the week and A, people ran with this saying that PS3 price announced and first off I was thinking, okay, no, price was not announced.

44
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:43,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Some guy made an inadvertent comment that may or may not even be the truth.

45
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:48,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know that this guy was a Sony exec or whatever but, you know, I just, still, it's not,

46
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:55,392
[SPEAKER_08]: With all due respect to Europe, Europe is not where the magic is happening right now in regards to PlayStation 3.

47
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:58,774
[SPEAKER_08]: The magic will happen there soon enough, but that's not where the systems are being made.

48
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:04,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Had this slip come from Sony in Japan, maybe I would have been a little more, you know, apt to believe it.

49
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:08,559
[SPEAKER_08]: But then how people suddenly made this direct conversion of euros to dollars.

50
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:13,501
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right, and completely disregarded the fact that usually the UK folks get screwed when it comes to price.

51
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,522
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very sorry, you guys.

52
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:15,222
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the fact.

53
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:16,783
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys kind of get screwed, so sorry.

54
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:18,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Not always, though.

55
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes they get games around the same price.

56
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,945
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of times they do get screwed.

57
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:27,846
[SPEAKER_08]: And that means that usually the amount that we pay in dollars, they pay in euros.

58
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:29,427
[SPEAKER_08]: It's usually about the conversion.

59
00:03:29,707 --> 00:03:30,667
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think you're right.

60
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:33,388
[SPEAKER_08]: $4.99 to $5.99 is more of a realistic point.

61
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:38,010
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, we've got the Revolution and the 360 to compete with.

62
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,251
[SPEAKER_08]: And unless you can sell me that I cannot live without Blu-ray...

63
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:43,966
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

64
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Gameplay, eh, it's not the same.

65
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:01,869
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know.

66
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:03,009
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know.

67
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:04,350
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't really know anything yet.

68
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,050
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just talking about the titles that they've announced so far.

69
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,772
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't seem, it's the same game Microsoft's playing.

70
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:15,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's make the games prettier and not change anything because, hey, it worked before, so.

71
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:19,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but take a game like Oblivion.

72
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:22,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Oblivion could not have been done on the regular Xbox.

73
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:25,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's so vast and it's so pretty.

74
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's really a next-gen game right there.

75
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:31,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you spend much time with Morrowind?

76
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:35,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot, but I'd seen it.

77
00:04:35,947 --> 00:04:38,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt the same game, just not as pretty.

78
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:44,030
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we're talking about gameplay, I wouldn't argue that there's a big difference there.

79
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

80
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Oblivion feels really big.

81
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:52,033
[SPEAKER_08]: And with everything that they're saying you can do with it and just all the vastness.

82
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:55,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, one part I didn't see in the other game was I didn't see character creation.

83
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:57,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it as thorough in that game?

84
00:04:57,635 --> 00:04:57,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

85
00:04:58,335 --> 00:04:58,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it was.

86
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:01,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I seem to recall that it was.

87
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:02,857
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been, you know...

88
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,422
[SPEAKER_06]: A good minute, but I do think so.

89
00:05:05,862 --> 00:05:08,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure people in our chat room will be able to help out there.

90
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:10,787
[SPEAKER_08]: OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat if you want.

91
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:14,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so, whatever.

92
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:16,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

93
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:18,620
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

94
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:50,224
[SPEAKER_08]: But who knows what that could mean for Xbox's future.

95
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:52,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what do you think about that news?

96
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Eh, whatever.

97
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:58,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft's just absorbing companies now, so... Spike?

98
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel similarly about this, about how I feel about their acquisition of Rare.

99
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:07,078
[SPEAKER_06]: They make one pretty trophy title a game every year or two.

100
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:14,834
[SPEAKER_06]: But overall, I don't see Anti-Lionhead as a big industry-changing, challenging force.

101
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:18,978
[SPEAKER_08]: But it only takes a handful of those trophy games to sell your system, asks Nintendo.

102
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,301
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very valid point.

103
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:27,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I don't really count Fable as a very great game.

104
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:28,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Fable...

105
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:34,772
[SPEAKER_08]: The only reason Fable was so freaking great was because there wasn't anything else like it on the Xbox.

106
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Go over to PlayStation 2, GameCube, you got plenty of games like Fable.

107
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:45,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, to Fable's credit, it was a little more expansive than most games in the way that you could control your character's fate.

108
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:47,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that we hadn't seen it before.

109
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:52,646
[SPEAKER_08]: but it was so fluid and it was such a turning point of the game, I don't think you really saw that in the other systems.

110
00:06:53,087 --> 00:07:03,373
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're right, the gameplay itself was not, I mean it was kind of button mashing was the fighting, it wasn't anything that revolutionary, but it still was really the only game like it on the Xbox.

111
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:05,494
[SPEAKER_08]: for that reason.

112
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:08,295
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would argue the same thing is happening with Oblivion.

113
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:14,017
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the only reason Oblivion is doing so phenomenally is it's got no competition on the 360 right now.

114
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:14,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

115
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:17,918
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no game even remotely close to what Oblivion is like.

116
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:30,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it's a great game that would be good even if there was competition, but still, I think the only reason why I see half my friends less playing this game is because I know my friends.

117
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:31,481
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of them are into role-playing games.

118
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:32,802
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing else for them to play on 360 right now.

119
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:35,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

120
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:37,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Just my thought.

121
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go on to another story.

122
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:44,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what's this about the Xbox Live Arcade?

123
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,217
[SPEAKER_09]: It's getting some new games, that's for sure.

124
00:07:47,817 --> 00:08:03,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting off here with Cloning Clyde, which sounds pretty weird, but basically they're keying this as it's going to be a completely unique 3D adventure and puzzle game that may bring a new meaning to the word schizophrenic.

125
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:04,428
[SPEAKER_09]: So,

126
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:09,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, Clyde was an ordinary but slightly dim guy before Dupliclone Inc.

127
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:12,294
[SPEAKER_09]: paid him $20 to take part in a cloning experiment.

128
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:16,495
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess, you know, things go crazy from there.

129
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:20,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, yeah, it's going to be coming to the live arcade.

130
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:31,359
[SPEAKER_09]: It is made by a company called Ninja Bee, who you might remember did Outpost Cloaky X, which is a pretty big hit on Xbox Live.

131
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,700
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, check it out when it comes out.

132
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:35,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Geometry Wars Crystal Quest

133
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Not totally, but very similar.

134
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:58,078
[SPEAKER_08]: And same with Feeding Friends.

135
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:03,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, because you don't have a gun in Feeding Friends, but just, I don't know, that whole dodging thing feels... It feels a little similar.

136
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it Mutant Storm?

137
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't even played that one.

138
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:09,962
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also Robotron.

139
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:11,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, wait a minute.

140
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:12,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Robotron's a classic.

141
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:13,943
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, a classic classic.

142
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,064
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't... Yeah, but I'm saying that they're all similar.

143
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:24,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying that... Robotron's more like Smash TV, if anything else, but both were made by the same company, so you could almost say that Smash TV in a effed up way is like

144
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:25,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Robotron.

145
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:28,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'm just crazy.

146
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:34,061
[SPEAKER_08]: We mentioned in Part A that you can get brand new outfits for Cameo.

147
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:34,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Woohoo!

148
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:41,100
[SPEAKER_08]: You can dress them up as Orchid and Killer Instinct characters and all those other things.

149
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:49,343
[SPEAKER_08]: But also one thing that should be noted about Cameo, they just patched their co-op mode, and now you can do the online co-op play with Cameo.

150
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:53,325
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe new achievements come with this as well, but here's the thing.

151
00:09:53,645 --> 00:10:02,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Cameo has already hit their limit of 1,000 achievement points, now there are zero-point achievements that you can get in Cameo with this new patch, is what I'm hearing.

152
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,569
[SPEAKER_08]: You get achievements, but they're not worth anything.

153
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:04,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares?

154
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,116
[SPEAKER_08]: That's dead to me.

155
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:12,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, some people really wanted to do co-op and cameo.

156
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:15,820
[SPEAKER_09]: What they should do then is still give you the co-op achievements.

157
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares if you play over live?

158
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Just do the same co-op achievements that they have in the game.

159
00:10:21,345 --> 00:10:23,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, you know, now you can play live or local.

160
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,309
[SPEAKER_08]: And HitStun says the online co-op patch is free, right?

161
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:28,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that is true.

162
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:28,609
[SPEAKER_08]: It is free.

163
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:29,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

164
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,991
[SPEAKER_08]: So enjoy the free things while you can.

165
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:37,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure as soon as you put in Cameo, I haven't patched mine yet, but I'm sure as soon as you put in Cameo, it'll say, an upgrade for this game is now available.

166
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:38,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

167
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:40,896
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it'll just patch its way onto your hard drive.

168
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:42,517
[SPEAKER_06]: That is assuming you have a hard drive.

169
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:46,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we can be underwhelmed with people on the internet at the same time.

170
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:50,555
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what just made that made me think of though?

171
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:51,896
[SPEAKER_08]: What happens if you don't have a hard drive?

172
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:53,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you just screwed?

173
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you gonna have to patch this game every time?

174
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:59,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you can maybe download the patch to your memory card.

175
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:01,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I guess that's a good point.

176
00:11:01,565 --> 00:11:02,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess you could save it to your memory card.

177
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:04,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, how are you going to play anything with a memory card?

178
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:05,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

179
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:07,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Memory card was just useless.

180
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,872
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just something that they put out there and say, you know what?

181
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:16,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, there's an option to buying the... No, you can take your memory card to an Xbox 360 kiosk and get Uber special downloads.

182
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:18,178
[SPEAKER_08]: That don't work!

183
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:26,965
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, where the fuck is my goddamn burnout card that they promised me months ago that I downloaded from the kiosk and then we go to play Burnout?

184
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:28,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, by the way, it doesn't work!

185
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:31,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, did we say working car?

186
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:32,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe we did.

187
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:34,328
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know what?

188
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,028
[SPEAKER_09]: You're fucked.

189
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:37,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I love setting him off.

190
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:41,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid kiosk thing.

191
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Why'd I spend the money on that stupid card?

192
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:45,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

193
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:47,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, what's next on the news?

194
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:50,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously?

195
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:54,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the Michigan game law was ruled unconstitutional.

196
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:56,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, we didn't see that coming.

197
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:57,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

198
00:11:58,311 --> 00:12:02,494
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, basically thrown out because, yeah, it's unconstitutional, blah, blah, blah.

199
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Was the Michigan law like the California law, or what was the deal there?

200
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:08,479
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest, I don't know if it was very similar or not.

201
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:10,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I imagine they're probably pretty close.

202
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:13,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

203
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:18,145
[SPEAKER_09]: They really shouldn't try to regulate the game sales and stuff.

204
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:22,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was, as it summed up, intended to restrict the sale of certain games to minors.

205
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:25,527
[SPEAKER_08]: And they say that was unconstitutional and can't be implemented.

206
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:27,708
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sounds pretty similar to what we had going on in California here.

207
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:28,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

208
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:33,849
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I think that they should be able to sell porn to minors too now because it's unconstitutional.

209
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Children have the right to porn.

210
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:40,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you no dignity?

211
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:41,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you no dignity?

212
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:46,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox Live Friendless Notifier

213
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:14,429
[SPEAKER_08]: and you can even have it in a little task bar and it'll actually alert you when people sign on and offline.

214
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:24,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess what it's doing is it's kind of borrowing from exactly what Xbox Live, or I'm sorry, Xbox.com does, but it sort of delivers that news to your desktop.

215
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:28,338
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see when, you know, if you're stalking someone, you can see right when they come online.

216
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:29,439
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty cool.

217
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,241
[SPEAKER_08]: So like I'd be able to see if Loki's online from my computer.

218
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:33,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

219
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:36,166
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'm too lazy to access Xbox.com.

220
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:36,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

221
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:41,431
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised Microsoft didn't... I think the most surprising thing about this story is that someone beat Microsoft to it.

222
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:48,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if I were Microsoft right now, I'd be wanting to buy this software from this guy or acquire this guy.

223
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:49,840
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they would just want to sue him.

224
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:50,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

225
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they're Microsoft and they can't... Why would you sue this guy?

226
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:55,986
[SPEAKER_08]: He wrote a practical, useful application that...

227
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,622
[SPEAKER_08]: GK128 in the chatroom says, I have 360 friends, the program.

228
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:01,244
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool, but it hogs RAM.

229
00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:22,475
[SPEAKER_08]: So it might be a little bit of a memory hog.

230
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:24,935
[SPEAKER_08]: So have a lot of RAM if you're going to be using this program.

231
00:14:25,436 --> 00:14:33,698
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, also, it's a program that has, you know, it's written by, you know, a fan, essentially.

232
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:35,639
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's probably not optimized yet.

233
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's a first release, it sounds like.

234
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,521
[SPEAKER_08]: So if this guy decides to continue to upgrade this, it might get a little better in that regard.

235
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

236
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:46,603
[SPEAKER_08]: GK128 would like to point out it uses 63 megabytes of RAM currently.

237
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:48,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

238
00:14:49,564 --> 00:14:49,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

239
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

240
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:51,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

241
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:54,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on.

242
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you have some music game news.

243
00:14:57,674 --> 00:14:57,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

244
00:14:58,955 --> 00:15:00,316
[SPEAKER_09]: In the groove, PlayStation 2.

245
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:05,338
[SPEAKER_09]: As I've been stating before, this game is merely Stepmania.

246
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:12,102
[SPEAKER_09]: And now, like Stepmania, you can put your own songs in it for the PlayStation 2.

247
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:19,006
[SPEAKER_09]: However, of course, the tools have been out there already to unpack everything that's in the groove for the PlayStation 2.

248
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,293
[SPEAKER_09]: and actually dump that stuff to your hard drive so you can play the official songs because they're just Step Mania files.

249
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:38,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now they have the tools to repack it so you can actually put whatever songs you want in there and be able to burn it to a disc and either play it with any sort of tools that you use to play backup discs on a PlayStation 2 or hacks or work around or whatever.

250
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,765
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I guess that's pretty cool.

251
00:15:42,345 --> 00:15:47,549
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, one of the reasons why, you know, I don't understand why people pay for Step Mania, but...

252
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you can and I'm just not surprised.

253
00:15:53,463 --> 00:15:56,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew this was going to come one of these days and

254
00:15:57,316 --> 00:15:58,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that's available, that's kind of neat.

255
00:15:58,798 --> 00:15:59,859
[SPEAKER_09]: You get to play all your songs.

256
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,481
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like the In The Groove songs, go ahead and play the In The Groove songs.

257
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:05,183
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like DDR... Because you put DDR songs in In The Groove?

258
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:05,864
[SPEAKER_09]: They had it.

259
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:10,548
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR, all the DDR songs, In The Groove 2, and In The Groove songs, all in one disc.

260
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:11,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

261
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,770
[SPEAKER_09]: They had all this stuff in there.

262
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you just download this from the website, burn it, and ready to go?

263
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:16,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, it's not available on the website.

264
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:18,416
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to dig for it.

265
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:22,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, I cannot give out where it is, but...

266
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:27,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Your local Bomani downloading ISO place will probably have it.

267
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:29,130
[SPEAKER_09]: BitTorrent, that type of thing.

268
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:34,212
[SPEAKER_09]: So look for it and have fun, I guess.

269
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:37,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

270
00:16:38,594 --> 00:16:39,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

271
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:43,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Follow-up to a story we were talking about a few weeks ago.

272
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:49,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember the town in Ohio that got slammed on April Fool's?

273
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:51,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, we may not have done this on the last podcast.

274
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:54,506
[SPEAKER_08]: This may have been my spinoff show I did on Wednesday.

275
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:59,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked about this story about the girls who played the prank in the town and had little question mark blocks.

276
00:16:59,394 --> 00:16:59,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

277
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:31,430
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not thinking about the consequences of their actions in this day and age.

278
00:17:48,104 --> 00:17:51,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people don't know what a question mark block reference is.

279
00:17:51,526 --> 00:17:54,768
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're right, they probably think about Batman or something, you know?

280
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm going to blow up this streetlight.

281
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Al-Qaeda will strike us in our streetlights.

282
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:03,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my, now the FBI is going to monitor this program.

283
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:03,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

284
00:18:04,853 --> 00:18:05,394
[SPEAKER_06]: You jerk.

285
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:07,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of agree, though.

286
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:10,236
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an iconic symbol.

287
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:11,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't help but think...

288
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:16,057
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 out of 3 people in this room are going to know what that question mark is.

289
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:18,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the OLR statistics magic, right?

290
00:18:18,738 --> 00:18:23,021
[SPEAKER_08]: So 100% of Americans know what a question mark block is and shouldn't have been alarmed, right?

291
00:18:23,822 --> 00:18:24,702
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I'm saying.

292
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:27,484
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, the percentage must be over 50%.

293
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:31,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't help but believe that this... Not if you're an old person.

294
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:37,075
[SPEAKER_06]: So your grandmother wouldn't know what a question mark block is?

295
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:39,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless my grandma happened to be old granny hardcore, probably not.

296
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:43,678
[SPEAKER_08]: No, my grandma would have no idea what a question mark block is.

297
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:45,818
[SPEAKER_08]: She would have no idea.

298
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:49,680
[SPEAKER_08]: She would probably think about Frank Gorshin from Batman.

299
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,720
[SPEAKER_08]: The Riddler.

300
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,902
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my Riddler impersonation.

301
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:56,502
[SPEAKER_08]: That was great, huh?

302
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,003
[SPEAKER_08]: I worked on that all day.

303
00:18:58,423 --> 00:18:59,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I stand corrected.

304
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:03,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we won't be in so much trouble if we find a cure for cancer, right Loki?

305
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:09,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, in the meantime, though, you can play a game called Remission, where you can blow away cancer.

306
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:18,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, in this game, basically, you play a micro-robot by the name of, I believe, Roxy.

307
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:27,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And you are basically in the body and destroying these rapidly multiplying rogue cells.

308
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:30,768
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, it's something that they've

309
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:41,219
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of done to help cancer patients cope with their illness while educating them and increasing players' sense of control over their circumstances.

310
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:44,581
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

311
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:48,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, though, it should be mentioned that this game does not cure cancer.

312
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:51,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to clear up anything, because there's a lot of stupid people out there.

313
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:55,850
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what it kind of sounds like to me?

314
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,810
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like...

315
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:04,321
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like that old game that would be like the tooth fighter, the cavity fighting game.

316
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:11,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember I had this on Commodore 64, and you were like, you carried around the giant toothbrush, and you had to wipe the plaque, or you'd get attacked by the little cavity monsters.

317
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:15,208
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what this sounds like to me, except instead of teeth, it's cancer.

318
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:24,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and so cancer patients will get to play crappy games now, as if they weren't tortured enough about the fact that their cancer might not be operable.

319
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:27,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

320
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:46,652
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura is not here tonight as we mentioned earlier in the program.

321
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:47,872
[SPEAKER_08]: She's feeling sick.

322
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:49,212
[SPEAKER_08]: She has Asian Bird Flu.

323
00:20:49,553 --> 00:20:49,933
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm teasing.

324
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:53,194
[SPEAKER_08]: She doesn't have Asian Bird Flu, but she's sick and we hope she feels better soon.

325
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:58,116
[SPEAKER_08]: She's usually in charge of the mailbox and this would be the part where we would go to the mailbag

326
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:06,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com However, I haven't dug through the mailbag this week, so I have no idea what's in there.

327
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:10,827
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I have looked at the MySpace, and we got some questions on MySpace.

328
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:17,290
[SPEAKER_08]: People who didn't realize they can send it over to Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com So I'm going to go ahead and read a question that we got on MySpace.

329
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:19,532
[SPEAKER_08]: And this question comes to us from Joey.

330
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:20,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Joey!

331
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:25,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Joey says, Hey, I just got through part B of this week's podcast, meaning last week, 179.

332
00:21:26,054 --> 00:21:32,657
[SPEAKER_08]: The part where you guys talked about the Genesis got me to my closet and I pulled out my Genesis 3, the slim line of the Genesis, if you will.

333
00:21:33,237 --> 00:21:38,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I realized the only game I could find was my Street Fighter 2 Special Champions Edition and Mortal Kombat.

334
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I was hoping to restart my collection and hoping you could help me out by giving me a short list of good games to look for.

335
00:21:45,381 --> 00:21:51,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I know all about the Sonics and ToeJam and Earls, so maybe if you guys knew some non-mainstream games, that would be awesome.

336
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:55,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, do you remember the name of that new Genesis game being released?

337
00:21:55,823 --> 00:22:01,124
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if I heard about it from you guys, but this is the only show I can think of that would have cool news like that.

338
00:22:01,524 --> 00:22:03,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about the length of this, by the way.

339
00:22:03,144 --> 00:22:04,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a problem, Joey.

340
00:22:04,264 --> 00:22:06,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate the Myspace message.

341
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:06,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh...

342
00:22:07,345 --> 00:22:10,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Joey, the name of the game you're trying to think about on the Genesis is called Beggar Prince.

343
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:12,429
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the new game that's being released.

344
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:16,291
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did bring that up a few weeks ago on this show.

345
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:25,317
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, if you want to visit one of our buddies over on allgames.com, Bobby Blackwolf, visit his site at allgames.com slash podcast.

346
00:22:26,118 --> 00:22:29,200
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, I think he's also at bobbyblackwolfshow.com now.

347
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:33,362
[SPEAKER_08]: He had an interview with the people that made Beggar Prince.

348
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:34,623
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a really long interview.

349
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:37,105
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to hear all about Genesis development in this day and age,

350
00:22:37,618 --> 00:22:42,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Look back in his archives about six weeks or so, and he had an interview a while back, so check that out.

351
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:50,664
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as non-standard Genesis games, well, you didn't mention Phantasy Star, my friend, so if you're into RPGs, you don't want to miss the Phantasy Star series.

352
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,906
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a shame Jamie's not here, because she loves the obscure Genesis titles.

353
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:55,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you think of anything, Spike?

354
00:22:56,736 --> 00:22:59,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, could we start with Obscura and work our way down?

355
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:00,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we could go for a good hour here.

356
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, try me.

357
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:04,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Name some titles that this kid needs on his Genesis.

358
00:23:04,503 --> 00:23:08,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I would strongly recommend, let's see, Decap Attack.

359
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:10,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

360
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:14,854
[SPEAKER_06]: And the funny thing is, if you've never played it, I mean, it's a fairly cartoony game.

361
00:23:14,914 --> 00:23:23,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, you're a mummy zombie guy throwing your head at people, but it's done in a comical style of, like, Rise Star, which I would also recommend.

362
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:25,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Rise Star, Gunstar Heroes.

363
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:29,939
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that one that was, uh... It was, like, in a comic book.

364
00:23:30,739 --> 00:23:31,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Comics Zone?

365
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:32,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Comics Zone, yeah.

366
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:35,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Gunstar Heroes, by the way, was an excellent addition to that list, by the way.

367
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:36,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

368
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:36,961
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I...

369
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:39,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I highly recommend it.

370
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:44,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if we're going even with, you know, kind of the standard games, don't let yourself forget the Echo games.

371
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:47,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't let yourself forget Eternal Champions.

372
00:23:47,754 --> 00:23:53,217
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like substandard 2D graphics in a kind of subpar fighting game that's so cheesy you can't help but laugh.

373
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:56,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Comments from our chatroom here.

374
00:23:57,118 --> 00:23:58,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Some suggestions from the chatroom.

375
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend of Zaku suggests After Burner 2.

376
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma suggests Kid Chameleon.

377
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,503
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Pooeater suggests Alex Kidd.

378
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:07,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonder Boy and Monster World.

379
00:24:28,587 --> 00:24:29,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderboy and Monster World.

380
00:24:29,988 --> 00:24:30,808
[SPEAKER_06]: My best Genesis.

381
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:33,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie would say Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.

382
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:35,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you even get that in this country?

383
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know.

384
00:24:36,991 --> 00:24:38,092
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some suggestions for you.

385
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, a couple quick, quick emails.

386
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:49,998
[SPEAKER_08]: My sister sent me an email because I think she's listening to the program or something, but my sister sent me an email, Dana, and she says, Can you tell me what's wrong when I try to DDR and my foot won't work?

387
00:24:50,378 --> 00:24:53,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I try to dance, but when I go fast, my foot quits working.

388
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,501
[SPEAKER_08]: But I really like your Japanese pop.

389
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:58,610
[SPEAKER_08]: My sister writes her emails like a seven-year-old.

390
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Might I share?

391
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:07,517
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're playing too much DDR and your foot stops working, stop playing DDR for a couple days and then go back.

392
00:25:07,697 --> 00:25:09,739
[SPEAKER_08]: You should never push yourself too much on DDR.

393
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:14,002
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're feeling stamina, soreness issues, any of that stuff, seriously take a break.

394
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:15,263
[SPEAKER_08]: One other quick email.

395
00:25:15,283 --> 00:25:18,005
[SPEAKER_08]: This came to us from Justin M.,

396
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:21,246
[SPEAKER_08]: This came to my email box, not the normal mailbag.

397
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:24,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you've heard yet, but they're making a movie of DOA.

398
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:25,747
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks awesome.

399
00:25:25,787 --> 00:25:26,768
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes out this August.

400
00:25:27,508 --> 00:25:28,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome or awful?

401
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, got to disagree with you there.

402
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:37,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we know the Dead or Alive movie is coming, but as to the fact that it looks awesome, I suppose if you're into tits and ass, it'll be great.

403
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Or in Charlie's Angels.

404
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the first Charlie's Angels was good.

405
00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:44,291
[SPEAKER_08]: The second Charlie's Angels was...

406
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:52,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Second Charlie's Angels If you believe that, I'd like to sell you this Alone in the Dark DVD I have Stop.

407
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:54,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Be nice.

408
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:56,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Be nice to the people who email me.

409
00:25:57,386 --> 00:26:01,627
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, if you have an email you want to send us, send it over to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

410
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:04,428
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura will be back next week to read those emails.

411
00:26:04,848 --> 00:26:11,890
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, we will be doing a show next week on Easter Sunday because we have nothing better to do because our families don't love us and didn't invite us over.

412
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,311
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm teasing.

413
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:13,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine did.

414
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:14,411
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

415
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:21,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine did too, but I don't know about your house, but Easter dinner at my house is like 2 o'clock, so it leaves me plenty of time to do this program.

416
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:22,113
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

417
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:22,673
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

418
00:26:23,453 --> 00:26:23,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

419
00:26:23,813 --> 00:26:23,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

420
00:26:25,054 --> 00:26:25,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

421
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:26,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Cancelled games?

422
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:27,809
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

423
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:41,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, unfortunately, if you're, you know, really looking forward to spending the night on the internet with people and having virtual sex, think again.

424
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:48,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Spend the night, the MMO that was going to be put out, basically the sex MMO, cancelled!

425
00:26:50,336 --> 00:26:54,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Difficulty raising funds, I guess, is the reason for that.

426
00:26:55,518 --> 00:26:55,658
[SPEAKER_09]: And

427
00:26:56,601 --> 00:27:02,465
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's on hold indefinitely until they can make the money to pay the virtual prostitutes that are going to be in the game.

428
00:27:02,485 --> 00:27:02,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

429
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:04,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine that.

430
00:27:04,426 --> 00:27:06,047
[SPEAKER_08]: The sex game couldn't get funding.

431
00:27:06,807 --> 00:27:08,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was much rejoicing.

432
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:09,269
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

433
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:10,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I disagree.

434
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you know what?

435
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:20,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is it that we have a bazillion violent games, yet when we look at sex-related games, we have the guy game.

436
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:22,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Playboy Mansion.

437
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:24,939
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's...

438
00:27:26,637 --> 00:27:33,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to see a sexual game that's not super crappy.

439
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,460
[SPEAKER_06]: And you think this was that game?

440
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:40,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, maybe not, but I don't know.

441
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:45,744
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we should be frowning on it just because it's a sex game.

442
00:27:45,784 --> 00:27:48,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's plenty of violent games out there that are okay.

443
00:27:49,912 --> 00:27:53,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but you have to understand, murder okay, sex not okay.

444
00:27:53,994 --> 00:27:55,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Sex gets companies sued.

445
00:27:55,735 --> 00:27:57,436
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you make the people to murder?

446
00:27:57,696 --> 00:27:58,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Sex.

447
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:01,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

448
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:02,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the logic here?

449
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:04,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Shouldn't it be murder bad, sex good?

450
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:07,160
[SPEAKER_09]: What was hot coffee?

451
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Sex game.

452
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:09,701
[SPEAKER_09]: What was Grand Theft Auto?

453
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:10,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Murder game.

454
00:28:10,782 --> 00:28:13,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Murder game okay, sex game not okay.

455
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:23,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with your point, but I'm way more comfortable leveling with the party of MMO players than I am cybering with them with these 3D avatars.

456
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:24,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

457
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:25,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, people do it anyway.

458
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:32,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Your guild, obviously, in World of Warcraft is not as cool as mine, okay?

459
00:28:35,307 --> 00:28:38,190
[SPEAKER_08]: My guild is called World of Wank and they're a great time.

460
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:38,550
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

461
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm totally joking.

462
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:40,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you people don't think I'm serious.

463
00:28:40,892 --> 00:28:44,195
[SPEAKER_08]: But don't you think people do this in MMOs as it is?

464
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:45,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

465
00:28:47,618 --> 00:28:48,919
[SPEAKER_08]: The roleplay servers?

466
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:49,860
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think that is?

467
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,101
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think that's a front for?

468
00:28:51,461 --> 00:28:52,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Roleplay?

469
00:28:52,402 --> 00:28:52,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

470
00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:54,784
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what Sims Online was.

471
00:28:55,004 --> 00:28:58,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's exactly what Sims Online turned into.

472
00:28:58,067 --> 00:28:59,368
[SPEAKER_08]: It was one giant Vegas.

473
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:02,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

474
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:07,297
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are a fan of music games...

475
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,430
[SPEAKER_08]: This story is kind of old.

476
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is this on the show roll?

477
00:29:10,631 --> 00:29:10,991
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

478
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:12,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I forgot to post it last week.

479
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:13,252
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, fine.

480
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:15,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Then fine.

481
00:29:15,573 --> 00:29:26,238
[SPEAKER_08]: You may have already heard this, but Red Octane CEO Kelly Sumner revealed last week that there are products in development, other products in development.

482
00:29:26,758 --> 00:29:30,380
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy used to be with Take-Two Interactive Europe, but now he's with Red Octane.

483
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:37,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't tell you what the games are and when they're coming, but we kind of believe it's probably not just the Guitar Hero sequels.

484
00:29:38,163 --> 00:29:41,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps this is a rival to Konami's Bomani brand?

485
00:29:42,004 --> 00:29:42,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

486
00:29:43,444 --> 00:29:44,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Could be interesting.

487
00:29:45,604 --> 00:29:50,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think Beat Mania would have been a good game for them to compete with.

488
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:51,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think they'd still do it?

489
00:29:51,865 --> 00:29:53,706
[SPEAKER_08]: You say rival, I say cheap knockoff.

490
00:29:53,946 --> 00:29:56,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, wait a minute though.

491
00:29:57,266 --> 00:30:01,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe when you look at In The Groove DDR, I see your point there, despite the fact that it's still controversial.

492
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:05,068
[SPEAKER_08]: But Guitar Hero vs. Guitar Freaks, I don't think that was a cheap knockoff.

493
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:05,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't.

494
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:13,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Guitar Hero was original enough and did a lot of... Obviously, most of the critics out there, 99% of them feel the same way I do.

495
00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:22,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because 99% of the critics out there, they don't know the history of the music game series out there and they also don't do the research.

496
00:30:23,437 --> 00:30:23,617
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

497
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:26,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Death to them all!

498
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:27,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Death to them all!

499
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:58,440
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a cool game because it's new to us, the US and stuff, but to be honest, when these next few games come out, or the next sequel or whatever, it's just going to be like a whole Guitar Freaks thing.

500
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, granted, I'm not saying Guitar Freaks is innovative because it's been the same damn game since Fifth Mix.

501
00:31:02,662 --> 00:31:06,844
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been just cookie-cuttering the whole thing along the way, but still.

502
00:31:07,984 --> 00:31:09,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Spike, you have Adam first, then I'll go.

503
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:14,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I definitely prefer Guitar Freaks to Guitar Hero.

504
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:23,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not like Guitar Hero, but as a musician, I will say that playing Guitar Hero is way closer to playing an actual instrument.

505
00:31:23,871 --> 00:31:26,812
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that in that way, it's actually a superior game.

506
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:31,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if I don't prefer it myself, I think that on a technical level, it's a much more impressive work.

507
00:31:32,114 --> 00:31:35,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here's my deal, and I'm taking the music out of this equation.

508
00:31:35,335 --> 00:31:39,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even considering the music in Guitar Freaks and music in Guitar Hero, because that's a matter of opinion.

509
00:31:40,437 --> 00:31:42,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Just putting the game engines side by side.

510
00:31:42,578 --> 00:31:45,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Hero has way more of the fun factor in it.

511
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Freaks, turn it on, pick your song, go.

512
00:31:48,702 --> 00:31:49,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Turn it on, pick your song, go.

513
00:31:49,802 --> 00:31:58,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Hero has that whole like, oh, you're in a band and you have the shops where you can upgrade your guitars and unlock the songs and you do the whammy and there's a crowd there and they're yelling for you.

514
00:31:58,747 --> 00:32:02,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas Guitar Freaks is, here, look at this choppy animation while you play your song.

515
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,691
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot to be said there that makes it more of a party game.

516
00:32:05,751 --> 00:32:08,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so you upgrade your guitar, which does what?

517
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:11,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it changes the appearance of your guitar in the game.

518
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:12,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoop-a-dee-doo.

519
00:32:12,774 --> 00:32:14,276
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a crowd!

520
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,539
[SPEAKER_08]: What does Guitar Freaks have?

521
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

522
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:18,542
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have any of that.

523
00:32:19,423 --> 00:32:20,905
[SPEAKER_09]: It has the fact that it was first.

524
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:22,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Have at it.

525
00:32:25,336 --> 00:32:28,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't call it an original game, call it an improvement of another game.

526
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:37,983
[SPEAKER_08]: I will give you that because when I play Guitar Hero, it really does feel to me like I am playing Guitar Freaks mixed with Amplitude.

527
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:38,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

528
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:42,346
[SPEAKER_08]: But with more of the fun factor for me.

529
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:46,468
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a reason why it's so accessible to people.

530
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:48,189
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't mind it being a good game.

531
00:32:48,469 --> 00:32:51,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate the fact that people are calling it innovative because it's not.

532
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:55,542
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, granted, it may be more realistic to, you know, playing a guitar.

533
00:32:55,742 --> 00:32:57,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't make it innovative, makes it better, okay?

534
00:32:58,605 --> 00:33:03,350
[SPEAKER_09]: And also the fact that people are, you know, kind of basically posing this as an original game.

535
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,271
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not an original game.

536
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:05,912
[SPEAKER_09]: It fucking rips off three different games.

537
00:33:06,173 --> 00:33:07,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Puts the best things of them together.

538
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:09,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, that's a good idea.

539
00:33:09,636 --> 00:33:13,240
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically improving on those concepts, but it's not an original game.

540
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,481
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm just...

541
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:17,809
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate people calling it original and innovative.

542
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Katamari Damacy, that was original.

543
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:24,318
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not original.

544
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:26,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Comments from our chatroom.

545
00:33:26,201 --> 00:33:29,806
[SPEAKER_08]: GS191 says the only reason people like Guitar Hero is because of the music.

546
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:32,770
[SPEAKER_08]: The majority of America does not like the whole techno J-pop theme.

547
00:33:34,164 --> 00:33:34,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting point there.

548
00:33:35,945 --> 00:33:43,251
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have, let's say, FireBoma says, if you showed critics Guitar Freaks, they'd say it was a rip-off of Guitar Hero at this point in time.

549
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd agree with you, but that's just, you know, a lot of critics are ignorant.

550
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:47,375
[SPEAKER_08]: They're ignorant.

551
00:33:47,935 --> 00:33:55,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you watch, if they decide to release Guitar Freaks over here, people are like, why are they ripping off Guitar Hero?

552
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:56,642
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

553
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,104
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a crappy Guitar Hero knockoff.

554
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:03,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, I'm going to fucking beat those people to death is what's going to happen.

555
00:34:04,572 --> 00:34:18,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if Spike's laughing at the same thing I am, but DarkTetsuya wrote in the chatroom, ignorant, but he capitalized the first three letters of that word, and I'll just let you kind of dream up what he's trying to say there.

556
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll leave it to you.

557
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:25,029
[SPEAKER_08]: And then of course our chat room is just going off with what the mystery game could be.

558
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:38,318
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Poo Eater suggests Banjo Freaks, Fireboma suggests Clarinet Hero, DJ Poo Eater, Flute Hero, Hit Stun, Xylophone Hero, Drum Hero says Dark Knight, which I think a lot of us are thinking might be it.

559
00:34:39,038 --> 00:34:39,699
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, why not?

560
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:44,962
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're going to rip off Guitar Freaks, why don't they rip off Drum Mania while they're at it?

561
00:34:45,022 --> 00:34:45,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously.

562
00:34:47,278 --> 00:34:52,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I would not be surprised if that's the big surprise game at E3 is Drum Hero or whatever they call it.

563
00:34:54,163 --> 00:34:58,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Spirit Snare would like to point out people in reviews have actually nodded to Guitar Freaks at least once.

564
00:34:59,446 --> 00:35:01,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Depends what site you're reading it from, but you are right.

565
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:04,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I have seen those reviews that have been good enough to do that.

566
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on to a new topic.

567
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:07,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

568
00:35:09,332 --> 00:35:13,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought this game was already out, but there's a new game coming to the PlayStation 2 and PSP.

569
00:35:15,353 --> 00:35:16,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift

570
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Lame!

571
00:35:45,097 --> 00:35:45,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, for real?

572
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:48,346
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Fast and the Furious 3 Tokyo Drift coming out?

573
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:48,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

574
00:35:49,268 --> 00:35:49,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

575
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:51,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that just initial D the movie?

576
00:35:52,714 --> 00:35:55,175
[SPEAKER_06]: The funny thing is, it doesn't even have Paul Walker.

577
00:35:55,235 --> 00:35:57,195
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a guy who looks like Paul Walker.

578
00:35:57,215 --> 00:35:58,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought Paul Walker was in that.

579
00:35:58,816 --> 00:36:00,236
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Paul Walker is in that movie.

580
00:36:00,456 --> 00:36:01,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone was telling me a guy who looks like Paul Walker.

581
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:04,898
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Paul Walker is in that movie because Paul Walker has no work other than that.

582
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:06,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it Paul Walker Goes to Tokyo?

583
00:36:06,618 --> 00:36:07,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the plot?

584
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:08,059
[SPEAKER_08]: It's stupid.

585
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:10,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Paul Walker versus the Asian Mafia?

586
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,420
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically, ooh, the Asian chick who's hot.

587
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:17,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's bring her back and let's bring Paul Walker back because we need somebody from the original series.

588
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:18,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they'll have sex.

589
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:22,104
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, maybe they'll have sex and she'll get all hot and schoolgirl-like.

590
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, too bad.

591
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,167
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's going to miss him.

592
00:36:28,307 --> 00:36:32,129
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, does this movie have Vin Diesel in it?

593
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:35,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Ranma in our chat room would like to point this out and I'm almost positive he's right here.

594
00:36:36,252 --> 00:36:39,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Fast and the Furious was already in the arcade and it was based on the L.A.

595
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:40,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Rush engine.

596
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:42,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it was.

597
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:45,277
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyways, this game is going to be coming out.

598
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:54,448
[SPEAKER_09]: What's unique about it, well, I'm not sure if it's unique, but it's kind of cool, is they're going to have 500 body kits from authentic manufacturers.

599
00:36:54,488 --> 00:36:56,410
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're actually going to have real upgrade parts.

600
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:57,411
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

601
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:04,004
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also going to feature boss races as well as advanced rubber band artificial intelligence systems.

602
00:37:04,244 --> 00:37:08,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucking hate goddamn advanced rubber band artificial intelligence systems.

603
00:37:09,105 --> 00:37:15,147
[SPEAKER_09]: You're racing, you're kicking the AI's ass, and all of a sudden, they're going 500 fucking miles to catch up to you.

604
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:16,107
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so.

605
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:21,588
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're fucking outracing them... I love it in Initial D because I'm always behind in the race.

606
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:28,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be racing a friend, I'm always behind, and then it totally favors you on the last lap, and then right at the finish line, I get ahead of them, and they're like,

607
00:37:30,052 --> 00:37:35,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, when I'm playing Burnout or something like that, I will have destroyed the car I'm racing as.

608
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:43,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Racing against one car, and I've already almost slapped the guy, and all of a sudden he's going Mach 7 down this goddamn freeway.

609
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,381
[SPEAKER_09]: They catch up to me.

610
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:46,342
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I hate that shit.

611
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:49,164
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyways, this game's coming out.

612
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:51,185
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation 2, PSP only.

613
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:55,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Check it out if it looks good.

614
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:55,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

615
00:37:55,848 --> 00:37:57,949
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest, it's just going to be another racing game, and

616
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:02,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Their Midnight Club 3 dub edition remix just came out, what, a few weeks ago?

617
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:04,816
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like 1999.

618
00:38:05,337 --> 00:38:06,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Buy that instead.

619
00:38:06,939 --> 00:38:07,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously.

620
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't encourage them to make more movies.

621
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,891
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't say by... No, no, that's what I'm saying.

622
00:38:14,951 --> 00:38:18,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saying to the youth of America, do not encourage these people to make Fast and the Furious 4.

623
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:23,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, who the hell is in this that's, you know, what, the Asian chick now is in this, okay?

624
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Was Vin Diesel in this?

625
00:38:25,196 --> 00:38:25,476
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

626
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Was Paul Walker in this?

627
00:38:26,797 --> 00:38:27,157
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

628
00:38:27,497 --> 00:38:28,077
[SPEAKER_08]: That's sad.

629
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:35,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma in our chatroom is saying, hey, the Fast and the Furious 3 will own, for one reason, Keiko Kirikawa, who is Sailor Mars.

630
00:38:36,182 --> 00:38:40,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the only... The Asian chick, as I'm dubbing her, okay?

631
00:38:41,677 --> 00:38:51,466
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, she's lending her likeness to other really fun movies like the Dead or Alive movie, which sucks balls, by the way.

632
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:52,467
[SPEAKER_08]: You haven't seen it.

633
00:38:52,887 --> 00:38:55,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen the trailer, and it sucks balls.

634
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,092
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't judge a movie based off the trailer.

635
00:38:58,112 --> 00:39:01,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, the trailer is fucking, you know, let's rip off.

636
00:39:02,828 --> 00:39:11,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Charlie's Angels 2 I'm trying to think of a movie that had a great trailer that sucked balls Because if that's true, the reverse would be true What's a movie with a great trailer that sucked balls?

637
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:18,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say Fantastic Four, but I haven't seen it, so I can't really dog on it.

638
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:19,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, how about this?

639
00:39:20,016 --> 00:39:21,818
[SPEAKER_08]: The Transporter 1 and 2.

640
00:39:21,978 --> 00:39:22,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, there you go.

641
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:23,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Good call.

642
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:24,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Good call.

643
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,641
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Transporter 1 and 2.

644
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,922
[SPEAKER_08]: How about Freddy vs. Jason, maybe?

645
00:39:28,302 --> 00:39:30,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, you see the trailer and you go, that's a fucking great concept.

646
00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:33,046
[SPEAKER_08]: You go and see the movie and you're like, what the fuck?

647
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:34,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I just waste $10 on?

648
00:39:34,867 --> 00:39:35,408
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just teasing.

649
00:39:35,428 --> 00:39:36,128
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't that bad.

650
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:38,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't really rag on it.

651
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:40,972
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I mean, you get my point.

652
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Freddy vs. Jason was supposed to be cheesy.

653
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,885
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the whole point.

654
00:39:46,526 --> 00:39:50,833
[SPEAKER_08]: And it'll be just like Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash, if they ever do that.

655
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:52,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I wish they would.

656
00:39:52,595 --> 00:39:54,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Completely off-topic here.

657
00:39:54,138 --> 00:39:55,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Has anyone actually seen XXX2 or whatever?

658
00:39:59,043 --> 00:40:00,223
[SPEAKER_09]: No, why would I do that?

659
00:40:00,243 --> 00:40:00,724
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great, though.

660
00:40:00,744 --> 00:40:01,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen XXX1.

661
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,424
[SPEAKER_09]: They have this hilarious thing, though.

662
00:40:03,464 --> 00:40:08,286
[SPEAKER_09]: It's this bonus thing where they're talking about what happened to the original XXX character and Vin Diesel's character.

663
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:14,708
[SPEAKER_09]: And the way they've done it, they've shot... Every shot you see of XXX is just the back of him because it's not Vin Diesel.

664
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:18,729
[SPEAKER_09]: But they kill him off really bad.

665
00:40:19,229 --> 00:40:24,651
[SPEAKER_08]: That was that episode of South Park where they spliced all of Isaac Hayes' lines together to get Shaft.

666
00:40:26,211 --> 00:40:27,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, children!

667
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:30,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like to make love?

668
00:40:30,315 --> 00:40:30,915
[SPEAKER_08]: And that whole thing.

669
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:31,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

670
00:40:31,817 --> 00:40:33,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

671
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:34,260
[SPEAKER_08]: New story, please.

672
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:34,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

673
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Namco has new... Namco Bandai, I should say, has new plug-and-play controllers they're going to be releasing.

674
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:43,591
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Let's TV Play Classic.

675
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:50,020
[SPEAKER_08]: These controllers will plug directly into your TV and have four playable games, two old ones, two new ones.

676
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Namco Nostalgia has the retro Dragon Buster and new Dragon Buster 100.

677
00:40:57,324 --> 00:41:00,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Retail price is just under $30 US.

678
00:41:00,765 --> 00:41:03,267
[SPEAKER_08]: When I'm curious, are they going to have some of those other Namco things they've upgraded?

679
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:10,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Mappy, and it looks like Xevious on one of these box arts there, so there might be some kind of cool stuff.

680
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,772
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, before you start thanking Namco for this kind of stuff...

681
00:41:13,112 --> 00:41:15,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, Namco is putting out the Fast and the Furious game.

682
00:41:17,554 --> 00:41:19,355
[SPEAKER_09]: So, reserve your hate.

683
00:41:20,996 --> 00:41:21,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Well said.

684
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:25,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, it's tax season, right?

685
00:41:26,158 --> 00:41:26,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Who missed the memo?

686
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:29,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, Capcom in Japan.

687
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, either...

688
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:38,690
[SPEAKER_09]: They failed to report approximately 5.12 billion yen.

689
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:43,393
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about 44 million dollars in the US.

690
00:41:43,894 --> 00:41:51,639
[SPEAKER_09]: And over the course of six years, the penalty is about 1.2 billion yen or 10 million dollars in the US.

691
00:41:52,899 --> 00:41:56,922
[SPEAKER_09]: And so because of this, actually they delayed Dead Rising.

692
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,744
[SPEAKER_09]: It was one of the games that's being delayed right now because of that.

693
00:42:00,402 --> 00:42:03,004
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, yeah, it's kind of interesting.

694
00:42:04,786 --> 00:42:05,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

695
00:42:05,947 --> 00:42:06,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Slight oversight there.

696
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:08,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we have the file taxes?

697
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,212
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems like a reasonable mistake.

698
00:42:14,013 --> 00:42:14,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

699
00:42:15,674 --> 00:42:20,778
[SPEAKER_08]: We were just talking about Namco a minute ago, and there's an announcement kind of circulating this week.

700
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:25,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Old school Namco games are soon going to be available on Xbox Live Arcade because...

701
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:42,036
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, making that Namco collection that they released on Xbox making it backwards compatible just wouldn't be good enough let's milk some more money out of this franchise and let's put these games on Xbox Live so people can whore gamer points even more Pac-Man and Galaga are on their way to Xbox Live Arcade

702
00:42:42,356 --> 00:42:43,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Complete with leaderboards!

703
00:42:44,217 --> 00:42:44,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo!

704
00:42:44,677 --> 00:42:45,437
[SPEAKER_08]: And achievements!

705
00:42:45,557 --> 00:42:50,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't possibly fathom what achievements will be available on Pac-Man.

706
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:51,699
[SPEAKER_08]: You ate a ghost!

707
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:52,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Ding!

708
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:52,759
[SPEAKER_08]: 20 points!

709
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:54,400
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet you're gonna buy them, aren't you?

710
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably, because I'm a sad, sad man.

711
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:58,601
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, hasn't Pac-Man been on like every system?

712
00:42:59,141 --> 00:42:59,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Ever?

713
00:42:59,362 --> 00:42:59,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

714
00:43:00,682 --> 00:43:00,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

715
00:43:01,274 --> 00:43:01,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

716
00:43:02,075 --> 00:43:04,577
[SPEAKER_08]: So this really isn't much of a surprise, honestly.

717
00:43:04,938 --> 00:43:07,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just the fact that it's coming to the Xbox Live Arcade, I guess, is a surprise.

718
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:12,926
[SPEAKER_08]: But notice how Namco Museum, or actually, no, I think the Namco Museum, actually, I might be wrong.

719
00:43:13,006 --> 00:43:14,508
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is backwards compatible.

720
00:43:14,988 --> 00:43:18,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that 50th one, I think I do remember seeing it on the backwards compatibility list.

721
00:43:18,672 --> 00:43:19,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you can play it.

722
00:43:19,693 --> 00:43:20,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't matter anyways.

723
00:43:20,394 --> 00:43:22,336
[SPEAKER_08]: If you had a Ridge Racer, you could play it anyways.

724
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:23,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I guess that's true.

725
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:26,672
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very good point.

726
00:43:26,692 --> 00:43:31,233
[SPEAKER_08]: But they want you to pay $5 or maybe even $10, who knows, for leaderboards and what have you.

727
00:43:31,514 --> 00:43:32,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, here's an idea.

728
00:43:33,094 --> 00:43:43,358
[SPEAKER_08]: How about a port of the Pac-Man Versus like you had on the Game Boy Advance that you could hook into the GameCube where you could play it on Xbox Live and some of your friends are the ghosts?

729
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:44,989
[SPEAKER_08]: and you're the Pac-Man.

730
00:43:45,149 --> 00:43:46,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, wouldn't that be a lot better?

731
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't that make my money more worthwhile?

732
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:48,671
[SPEAKER_08]: How about this?

733
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:55,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of just porting over the original Pac-Man, how about you port over one of the Pac-Man remakes that they have, you know, where the graphics are at least a little bit better?

734
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:55,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

735
00:43:56,095 --> 00:44:01,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Where, you know, it might utilize the widescreen, you know, like it did on the PSP, but no.

736
00:44:01,657 --> 00:44:07,400
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we have to port over the original one and put some art on the side there because, yeah, it's great.

737
00:44:08,322 --> 00:44:09,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

738
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:12,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma in the chatroom says, Fuck Pac-Man vs. I want Pac-Mania.

739
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:13,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I want them both.

740
00:44:13,825 --> 00:44:16,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't we just get like a small Pac-Man anthology there?

741
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:17,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

742
00:44:17,907 --> 00:44:19,907
[SPEAKER_08]: For five bucks for old games, come on.

743
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:21,888
[SPEAKER_08]: You can give me some other old Pac-Mania.

744
00:44:21,908 --> 00:44:23,029
[SPEAKER_08]: You can give me Pac-Mania.

745
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:28,291
[SPEAKER_08]: You can give me Pac-Man 91 or whatever it was when they did the souped up versions.

746
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:29,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me some of that.

747
00:44:31,193 --> 00:44:31,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Sigh.

748
00:44:32,915 --> 00:44:33,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

749
00:44:33,896 --> 00:44:35,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wait, first I want to mention this.

750
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,101
[SPEAKER_08]: GamerPoints.

751
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:49,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I was reading the Xbox forums this week and I saw some person say that they had rented Top Spin 2 and that they had figured out a way for them and their friend to play on Xbox Live and whore up the GamerPoints.

752
00:44:49,617 --> 00:44:52,820
[SPEAKER_08]: by, because if you quit out of a match, you still get credit for playing the match.

753
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,743
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was really easy to unlock the 25 and 50 matches gamer points.

754
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:01,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it ethical to do this, to cheat your way to getting these gamer points?

755
00:45:01,346 --> 00:45:08,532
[SPEAKER_08]: How about renting games, getting the points, or basically renting games just for the sole purpose of milking out as many points as you can.

756
00:45:08,592 --> 00:45:09,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that ethical?

757
00:45:09,312 --> 00:45:12,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, renting games, I wouldn't say it's not ethical.

758
00:45:13,035 --> 00:45:16,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say that you just, you know, probably could be doing better things with your time and money.

759
00:45:17,459 --> 00:45:17,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

760
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:26,622
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're playing the games to actually get the points correctly, then that's your prerogative if you want to go and rent these really crappy games to get the points out of them.

761
00:45:27,882 --> 00:45:32,142
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as cheating to get points, I don't think it's right, but I do it.

762
00:45:35,183 --> 00:45:46,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't go as far as quitting games and stuff like that to cheat, but for example, Far Cry has cheat codes, and Ubisoft, they let you get achievement points with the cheat codes, and they have the same thing with Ghost Recon.

763
00:45:47,363 --> 00:45:52,025
[SPEAKER_09]: It's their own damn fault that they didn't program it in there where you can't get the achievement with those.

764
00:45:52,646 --> 00:45:57,008
[SPEAKER_09]: The outfit has cheat codes, but you don't get achievement points if you have them on.

765
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:02,170
[SPEAKER_09]: The outfit sucks, by the way, but I don't know.

766
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:04,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's their own fault for that.

767
00:46:06,072 --> 00:46:10,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess it's wrong that they're cheating, but I don't know.

768
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,815
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see a problem with them or any games.

769
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:14,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

770
00:46:14,576 --> 00:46:16,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I agree with your point.

771
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's renting the games to get the points that's so bad.

772
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:26,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I've borrowed games from you, and I've worked my way to getting achievement points, but I would never cheat the system to do it.

773
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:29,716
[SPEAKER_08]: That whole quitting in and out thing, that was just stupid.

774
00:46:31,477 --> 00:46:35,740
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, you know, if I notice that, yeah, I'm going to get 10 points if I do this special little thing.

775
00:46:36,141 --> 00:46:39,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'll go to, it's like in Geometry Wars, right?

776
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:42,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's going to sit there for 60 seconds dodging all the monsters?

777
00:46:42,245 --> 00:46:43,727
[SPEAKER_08]: You wouldn't usually think to do that.

778
00:46:44,087 --> 00:46:46,068
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, hey, it was worth 10 points.

779
00:46:46,108 --> 00:46:46,789
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give it a try.

780
00:46:46,989 --> 00:46:48,410
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's a little bit of a challenge.

781
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes, you know, a little task.

782
00:46:50,572 --> 00:46:51,733
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like a mission.

783
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:53,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I sort of think of it that way.

784
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think there's anything unethical about doing that.

785
00:46:55,334 --> 00:46:59,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, you can't really rent a game like Geometry Wars, but I think that theory applies.

786
00:46:59,295 --> 00:47:02,056
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to rent games and accomplish as much as you can, I think that's okay.

787
00:47:02,296 --> 00:47:06,417
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think when you resort to cheating and those things, I don't think that's okay.

788
00:47:07,237 --> 00:47:09,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically for the purpose of getting gamer points.

789
00:47:09,337 --> 00:47:11,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you're cheating your way through the game, then whatever.

790
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:12,678
[SPEAKER_08]: You've already made that decision.

791
00:47:12,718 --> 00:47:16,979
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think Xbox should figure out a way to disable gamer points when you're cheating.

792
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:20,320
[SPEAKER_08]: My point... But if the developers left it in there, that's their own downfall.

793
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,021
[SPEAKER_09]: My point with Far Cry, for example, the game's hard enough even when you are cheating.

794
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:24,761
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know what?

795
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:28,442
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just added fun for my... They don't have an infinite health code.

796
00:47:28,662 --> 00:47:34,543
[SPEAKER_09]: They just have infinite ammo and infinite, like, feral or your adrenaline or whatever.

797
00:47:34,883 --> 00:47:36,184
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's still really fun.

798
00:47:36,224 --> 00:47:37,124
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still really hard.

799
00:47:37,784 --> 00:47:41,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just makes it so where I don't have to go and try to collect ammo and

800
00:47:41,564 --> 00:47:43,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Fireboma wants to know, what do the gamer points do?

801
00:47:57,011 --> 00:47:57,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing!

802
00:47:58,072 --> 00:47:59,294
[SPEAKER_08]: They really aren't anything.

803
00:47:59,935 --> 00:48:01,377
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an internet penis thing.

804
00:48:01,657 --> 00:48:04,181
[SPEAKER_08]: The more points you have, the bigger your internet penis is.

805
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:06,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, even if you're a girl, you know what I'm talking about.

806
00:48:07,064 --> 00:48:11,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about that whole, you know, look at me, I'm cool because I have, you know, 50 million gamer points.

807
00:48:11,751 --> 00:48:11,971
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?

808
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:13,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's pretty cool.

809
00:48:13,292 --> 00:48:14,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's cool too.

810
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:39,731
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ PooEater would like to know, is it virtual boobs for the girl gamers?

811
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,452
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Roz in the chatroom says, my e-penis, hers is 12 miles long on a cold day.

812
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:09,248
[SPEAKER_08]: That's quite the impressive e-penis there.

813
00:49:10,768 --> 00:49:12,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, what was the other comment in here I saw?

814
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:15,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, GS191 said, great, point whoring.

815
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:17,331
[SPEAKER_08]: What's next, the achievement point police?

816
00:49:18,691 --> 00:49:20,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Head on over to the Xbox Live forums.

817
00:49:20,392 --> 00:49:24,953
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some people on there that have their panties in a bunch that people are cheating their way to getting these points.

818
00:49:28,495 --> 00:49:28,835
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

819
00:49:30,145 --> 00:49:35,069
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to open up the Skype line very, very soon over at our website, www.orangeloundtrader.com.

820
00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:40,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Click on Interact With Us, and you can call us on the Skype line to talk about anything that you want to here this last month.

821
00:49:41,001 --> 00:49:44,183
[SPEAKER_08]: A few minutes of the show open forum, but first, a couple quick notes.

822
00:49:44,743 --> 00:49:50,927
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, the other contest we promised we were going to do tonight, we are also doing a giveaway tonight for Amped 3.

823
00:49:52,247 --> 00:49:54,769
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the action-packed snowboarding game for the Xbox 360.

824
00:49:55,669 --> 00:49:57,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Loki, you actually own this game, right?

825
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:00,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to be honest, I haven't played this yet, but Loki, you own this.

826
00:50:00,652 --> 00:50:02,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I owned it, sold it, bought it back because I liked it.

827
00:50:03,174 --> 00:50:03,474
[SPEAKER_09]: But, uh...

828
00:50:04,294 --> 00:50:05,114
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you do in this game?

829
00:50:05,154 --> 00:50:05,895
[SPEAKER_08]: It's snowboarding?

830
00:50:05,995 --> 00:50:06,455
[SPEAKER_09]: It's snowboarding.

831
00:50:06,475 --> 00:50:10,736
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing that turned me off about it is because it didn't have live support because it would have been pretty sweet live.

832
00:50:11,116 --> 00:50:13,317
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's your snowboarding game type thing.

833
00:50:13,557 --> 00:50:20,519
[SPEAKER_09]: What's kind of cool about it is they have hang gliding in there as well, snowmobiles, sleds, which are pretty cool, and the sleds are fun.

834
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,150
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's just a really weird game.

835
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:27,731
[SPEAKER_09]: The cutscenes are done with weird comics, sock puppets.

836
00:50:27,851 --> 00:50:30,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I see a little pink bunny on the back of the box there.

837
00:50:30,252 --> 00:50:31,192
[SPEAKER_08]: That has my interest right there.

838
00:50:31,212 --> 00:50:32,453
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really acid trippy.

839
00:50:32,593 --> 00:50:35,113
[SPEAKER_09]: It reminds me of MTV2 or something like that.

840
00:50:35,674 --> 00:50:36,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Wonder Shosen or something?

841
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, very Wonder Shosen-ish.

842
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,096
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

843
00:50:57,435 --> 00:51:00,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you're feeling like a cheap bastard, you can win one right now.

844
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:06,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Just send an email to snow at orangeloungeradio.com and that's all you have to do.

845
00:51:06,281 --> 00:51:08,103
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to make you name anything.

846
00:51:08,163 --> 00:51:11,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Just send an email to snow at orangeloungeradio.com and say, I want to win.

847
00:51:12,086 --> 00:51:17,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, if you're an achievement point hoard, there are some pretty easy achievement points in there.

848
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:19,511
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's got a terrain editor, which is kind of neat.

849
00:51:19,611 --> 00:51:20,492
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

850
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:54,893
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, if you don't have a 360, I was actually at Fry's today and they had some there.

851
00:51:54,913 --> 00:51:56,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they're making their way around now.

852
00:51:56,194 --> 00:51:57,635
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get a 360 now.

853
00:51:59,196 --> 00:52:01,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so just to clarify, some folks in our chatroom are saying, is this for PS2?

854
00:52:02,017 --> 00:52:04,059
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is Xbox 360 Amp 3.

855
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Amp 2 and Amp 1?

856
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:09,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are Xbox, I think.

857
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you get those on PS2.

858
00:52:11,123 --> 00:52:14,325
[SPEAKER_08]: It's made by 2K Games, who also made Top Spin 2, which I talked about earlier in the show.

859
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:18,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we can't wait to give stuff away next week.

860
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:25,749
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be pulling for not just that, but the 24 game we gave away in Part A. And if you missed it, listen to Part A, because we'll tell you how to win the 24 game.

861
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:35,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, Lara Croft, I bashed the Tomb Raider demo earlier in the show, but at least there's some good news coming Lara Croft's way.

862
00:52:36,272 --> 00:52:40,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Lara Croft, don't ask me why, I really don't know why.

863
00:52:41,863 --> 00:52:48,088
[SPEAKER_09]: She's earned a Guinness World Record as the most successful video game heroine.

864
00:52:49,129 --> 00:52:51,871
[SPEAKER_09]: To which I ask, what about Mrs. Pac-Man?

865
00:52:53,132 --> 00:52:53,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

866
00:52:54,053 --> 00:52:57,796
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of a fucking record is that anyways?

867
00:52:58,236 --> 00:52:58,957
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a record.

868
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:01,078
[SPEAKER_09]: She didn't eat the most chili dogs in the world.

869
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:05,382
[SPEAKER_09]: She didn't grow the longest carrot.

870
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:07,624
[SPEAKER_09]: She's just a fake person.

871
00:53:09,306 --> 00:53:09,746
[SPEAKER_09]: in a game.

872
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:17,888
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, okay, over the past 10 years, Lord Croft has sold, they've sold over 28 million games worldwide in the Tomb Raider series.

873
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:29,512
[SPEAKER_09]: It's appeared on stage with U2 and covers over 200 magazines and more recently, of course, Angelina Jolie put out two really awful movies.

874
00:53:30,192 --> 00:53:30,352
[SPEAKER_09]: And

875
00:53:31,755 --> 00:53:43,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and they have even over, it's a $1 billion industry with items from lunchboxes, soft drinks, motor vehicles, and receiving the Lord Croft brand treatment.

876
00:53:43,063 --> 00:53:48,828
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of fucking vehicle has Tomb Raider edition or something like that?

877
00:53:48,968 --> 00:53:50,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not heard of that, but.

878
00:53:53,007 --> 00:53:56,309
[SPEAKER_08]: All that news in the world did not make that demo any better, I'm sorry to say.

879
00:53:56,509 --> 00:53:57,129
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

880
00:53:57,409 --> 00:53:58,510
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I have to ask, though?

881
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:02,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Guinness Book losing its edge?

882
00:54:02,832 --> 00:54:05,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, are they just letting anyone come into this book nowadays?

883
00:54:06,014 --> 00:54:07,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, even fake people.

884
00:54:08,075 --> 00:54:11,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I can understand if someone did a speed run through Tomb Raider.

885
00:54:11,777 --> 00:54:13,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Could we get a world record for something?

886
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,600
[SPEAKER_08]: How about most Guinness drank on a podcast?

887
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,741
[SPEAKER_08]: We might be able to do that.

888
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:20,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll join in for that one.

889
00:54:45,821 --> 00:54:54,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, once again, I am sitting around playing Advance Crack after being sick for all of last week, which is why I didn't call.

890
00:54:54,423 --> 00:54:55,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get Jamie sick?

891
00:54:57,404 --> 00:54:58,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, maybe.

892
00:55:00,065 --> 00:55:03,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, what did you call in to talk to us about tonight?

893
00:55:04,006 --> 00:55:07,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Was one of our stories you have some feedback to or anything?

894
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:11,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we could talk about my wonderful e-penis if you'd like.

895
00:55:11,592 --> 00:55:14,414
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually has a name and a holiday.

896
00:55:15,194 --> 00:55:20,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually going to suggest, because I remember you were mentioning about your large e-penis earlier.

897
00:55:20,537 --> 00:55:29,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it appropriate for me to be saying that girls who have a lot of achievement points on Xbox Live or other types of online accomplishments have an e-penis, or is that sexist?

898
00:55:29,822 --> 00:55:30,122
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

899
00:55:30,362 --> 00:55:30,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Just making sure.

900
00:55:30,862 --> 00:55:31,823
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely acceptable.

901
00:55:31,863 --> 00:55:33,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine has a name, actually.

902
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:33,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

903
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:35,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it General Grant.

904
00:55:36,345 --> 00:55:37,046
[SPEAKER_08]: General Grant.

905
00:55:37,066 --> 00:55:37,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

906
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

907
00:55:39,262 --> 00:55:41,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you call your EP-ness General Grant?

908
00:55:43,384 --> 00:55:45,346
[SPEAKER_01]: It all started one night.

909
00:55:46,146 --> 00:55:53,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was actually March 29th, which is our made-up holiday.

910
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:57,133
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just came up with it.

911
00:55:57,173 --> 00:55:58,474
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought of the name and...

912
00:56:00,685 --> 00:56:14,132
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, there's some guys out there that name their, you know, I ain't talking about E, okay, they name their real deal, and usually it's just because, now I don't, sorry, but usually it's just, you know, because they think of it one random night.

913
00:56:14,172 --> 00:56:21,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe when they're high or something, I don't know, but it comes to them in a dream, and suddenly it has a name.

914
00:56:22,536 --> 00:56:23,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I can understand that.

915
00:56:25,026 --> 00:56:30,147
[SPEAKER_08]: SpiritSnare would like to point out in our chat room, you named your e-penis, you win the podcast.

916
00:56:30,307 --> 00:56:30,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations.

917
00:56:31,568 --> 00:56:36,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And Gizm would like to know, or Gizm, I hope it's not Gizm, that might be bad.

918
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:41,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Gizm says, sorry buddy, sorry, sorry.

919
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:43,690
[SPEAKER_08]: What am I listening to?

920
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:44,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha, ha, ha.

921
00:56:48,592 --> 00:56:50,412
[SPEAKER_08]: You won the show and I just lost it.

922
00:56:50,492 --> 00:56:50,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

923
00:56:51,612 --> 00:56:51,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

924
00:56:52,693 --> 00:56:52,953
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

925
00:56:53,373 --> 00:56:54,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Roz, anything else on your mind?

926
00:56:56,111 --> 00:56:57,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Advance Wars.

927
00:56:58,032 --> 00:56:59,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit, it's so fun.

928
00:57:00,014 --> 00:57:01,395
[SPEAKER_08]: You're still playing that game?

929
00:57:01,435 --> 00:57:03,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ever going to put it down and maybe try some Kingdom Hearts 2?

930
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:04,396
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

931
00:57:04,777 --> 00:57:10,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll stop for a while and play more Phoenix Wright, but I don't think I'll move from those two.

932
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:12,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well Phoenix Wright is a good game too.

933
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:17,845
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing with Kingdom Hearts is that my PS2 is dead.

934
00:57:18,826 --> 00:57:20,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, really, really dead.

935
00:57:21,665 --> 00:57:25,948
[SPEAKER_08]: In a couple short months, the PS3 will be out, and then the PS2 is bound to get a price cut.

936
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:32,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's probably a good thing for me, because my PS2 is dead, and I miss playing Akaji.

937
00:57:33,694 --> 00:57:36,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Roz, you should beg and plead maybe our chatters.

938
00:57:36,335 --> 00:57:38,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they'll take up a collection for a new PS2 for you.

939
00:57:39,197 --> 00:57:40,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Offer to show them General Grant.

940
00:57:40,899 --> 00:57:42,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, General Grant wants a PS2.

941
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,160
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

942
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Roz, I've got to let you go so we can get to another call, but thank you so much for calling in, okay?

943
00:57:47,003 --> 00:57:47,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, bye.

944
00:57:47,383 --> 00:57:47,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

945
00:57:48,104 --> 00:57:48,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

946
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:50,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go to another call.

947
00:57:50,158 --> 00:57:51,259
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting hammered tonight, guys.

948
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:52,339
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to be able to get to everybody.

949
00:57:52,359 --> 00:57:52,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so sorry.

950
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

951
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

952
00:57:58,282 --> 00:57:59,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

953
00:58:00,923 --> 00:58:01,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Slam that door.

954
00:58:01,663 --> 00:58:02,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

955
00:58:03,323 --> 00:58:05,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, this is Spirit Snare.

956
00:58:05,484 --> 00:58:06,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Spirit Snare.

957
00:58:06,405 --> 00:58:07,105
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

958
00:58:07,585 --> 00:58:09,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did you have to shut the door there?

959
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:10,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you afraid somebody was going to hear me?

960
00:58:13,347 --> 00:58:14,528
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my brother, actually.

961
00:58:15,568 --> 00:58:16,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell him to stop being a brat.

962
00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:17,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, what's on your mind?

963
00:58:18,335 --> 00:58:21,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, whatchamacallit, about Guitar Hero being innovative.

964
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:35,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, um, I was actually surprised that you didn't, um, you guys didn't, like, you guys weren't outraged, like, um, whatchamacallit, back when it was announced over at the, um,

965
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:42,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Over at the Game Developers Conference When Guitar Hero was first announced at E3?

966
00:58:43,172 --> 00:58:50,017
[SPEAKER_10]: No, when Guitar Hero was announced as being the most innovative at the GDC Oh yeah, what do you think about that, Loki?

967
00:58:50,037 --> 00:58:55,361
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember how Guitar Hero won the prize of most innovative among many other awards Guitar Hero's won this year?

968
00:58:56,902 --> 00:59:01,526
[SPEAKER_08]: He's making a jerk-off motion with his hand there, that's lovely It's retarded, let me put that out there

969
00:59:02,995 --> 00:59:03,837
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, Loki?

970
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:04,939
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you're in the minority.

971
00:59:04,979 --> 00:59:07,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of people think... But I will say this, though.

972
00:59:07,746 --> 00:59:08,106
[SPEAKER_08]: I think...

973
00:59:08,894 --> 00:59:13,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Their amplitude, frequency should have been given more of those types of honors.

974
00:59:13,775 --> 00:59:19,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is kind of like, okay, you know how the Grammys have a best new artist category every year?

975
00:59:19,696 --> 00:59:27,097
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes the person who wins the best new artist, this is actually like their fifth album, but they're just now getting noticed, right?

976
00:59:27,117 --> 00:59:27,577
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

977
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,758
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what this reminds me of.

978
00:59:29,978 --> 00:59:35,258
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, okay, it's not really a new concept, but they did it so well this time, we're going to notice them.

979
00:59:36,999 --> 00:59:38,219
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly what this is like to me.

980
00:59:39,907 --> 01:00:03,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but even though Guitar Freaks was released way ahead of their time, even though it's a mixed-up concept and stuff, that really shouldn't have deserved the award.

981
01:00:04,963 --> 01:00:07,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess everybody is open to their own opinion.

982
01:00:08,226 --> 01:00:10,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to share with us tonight, Spirit Snare?

983
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:11,870
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

984
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:12,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

985
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:13,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thanks for your call.

986
01:00:13,391 --> 01:00:14,232
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate it, okay?

987
01:00:14,913 --> 01:00:15,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

988
01:00:15,293 --> 01:00:15,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one.

989
01:00:15,693 --> 01:00:16,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for listening.

990
01:00:17,315 --> 01:00:17,555
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

991
01:00:17,595 --> 01:00:20,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to another call here.

992
01:00:20,058 --> 01:00:22,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to this one.

993
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:23,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

994
01:00:23,741 --> 01:00:24,822
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

995
01:00:25,963 --> 01:00:26,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Sky.

996
01:00:26,704 --> 01:00:27,725
[SPEAKER_08]: It's me, Raven's Dolphin.

997
01:00:27,765 --> 01:00:28,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Raven's Dolphin.

998
01:00:28,846 --> 01:00:29,527
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

999
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to comment on that achievement points.

1000
01:00:35,201 --> 01:00:35,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1001
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:37,741
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to say?

1002
01:00:39,082 --> 01:00:40,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I hate them.

1003
01:00:41,602 --> 01:00:42,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you hate them?

1004
01:00:43,683 --> 01:00:47,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I only have 630 and all my friends got 1300.

1005
01:00:47,924 --> 01:00:48,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I have 900.

1006
01:00:48,564 --> 01:00:50,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I have more than you.

1007
01:00:50,725 --> 01:00:53,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's just great.

1008
01:00:55,506 --> 01:01:00,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the only reason you're upset is because you have a few points whereas a lot of people have more?

1009
01:01:02,046 --> 01:01:05,468
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just way too poor to buy $60 games.

1010
01:01:06,068 --> 01:01:10,150
[SPEAKER_08]: What about the cheapy little $5 and $10 games you can get on Xbox Live?

1011
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:12,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Feeding Frenzy, 75 easy, easy points.

1012
01:01:12,991 --> 01:01:15,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Crystal Quest, probably 100 easy points right there.

1013
01:01:17,093 --> 01:01:19,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saving my Microsoft points for Street Fighter.

1014
01:01:19,494 --> 01:01:20,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to kick someone's ass.

1015
01:01:20,595 --> 01:01:21,095
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1016
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:24,397
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Street Fighter is finally supposed to be coming out in, I think, April.

1017
01:01:24,717 --> 01:01:26,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, that will come out.

1018
01:01:26,118 --> 01:01:28,879
[SPEAKER_08]: But, of course, they've been saying this, you know, for three months now.

1019
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,240
[SPEAKER_08]: But if they're going to fix the lag, I guess it's a good thing.

1020
01:01:33,018 --> 01:01:40,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I'm excited for, but... Can I say one more thing?

1021
01:01:40,801 --> 01:01:41,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

1022
01:01:44,203 --> 01:01:47,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, uh... The Mac bootcamp thing?

1023
01:01:50,946 --> 01:01:54,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the greatest thing that Mac ever did, supporting Windows.

1024
01:01:54,287 --> 01:01:54,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

1025
01:01:55,147 --> 01:01:56,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, yay indeed.

1026
01:01:56,948 --> 01:01:58,769
[SPEAKER_04]: You can call me a hypocrite for nothing.

1027
01:02:00,265 --> 01:02:01,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, now I won't call you hypocrite.

1028
01:02:01,527 --> 01:02:03,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a smart move for Mac as well.

1029
01:02:05,112 --> 01:02:07,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, have a good one, RavensDolphin.

1030
01:02:08,637 --> 01:02:08,958
[SPEAKER_08]: See ya.

1031
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:11,800
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting a little bit of lag there with Raven's Dolphin.

1032
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll do one more call.

1033
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:14,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to say real fast, though.

1034
01:02:14,802 --> 01:02:19,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody said in chat room, let's see, where is it?

1035
01:02:19,586 --> 01:02:22,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it really is pronounced jism.

1036
01:02:22,568 --> 01:02:23,589
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you say that name.

1037
01:02:23,649 --> 01:02:25,530
[SPEAKER_08]: It's short for neologism.

1038
01:02:26,051 --> 01:02:27,452
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's actually pronounced jism.

1039
01:02:27,912 --> 01:02:29,153
[SPEAKER_08]: So I said the name right the first time.

1040
01:02:29,193 --> 01:02:32,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I do not have something dirty on the brain, you freaking perverts.

1041
01:02:32,576 --> 01:02:34,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know what you're talking about.

1042
01:02:34,577 --> 01:02:35,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know what you're talking about.

1043
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:36,719
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how pure my soul is.

1044
01:02:37,688 --> 01:02:38,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Zander from New Kineto, what's on your mind?

1045
01:02:57,554 --> 01:02:59,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have a whole lot on my mind tonight.

1046
01:02:59,395 --> 01:02:59,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?

1047
01:02:59,995 --> 01:03:01,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so glad that you called.

1048
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:03,637
[SPEAKER_08]: You better think of something quick to talk about.

1049
01:03:04,597 --> 01:03:05,758
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm going to talk about something.

1050
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:06,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1051
01:03:06,698 --> 01:03:07,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what is it?

1052
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:12,921
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is I wanted to talk to Jamie about something, but she's not here tonight.

1053
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:15,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we pass on a message for you?

1054
01:03:15,862 --> 01:03:17,763
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'll just wait until whenever she's back.

1055
01:03:18,103 --> 01:03:19,964
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell did you call in for tonight?

1056
01:03:20,284 --> 01:03:21,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we help you?

1057
01:03:22,025 --> 01:03:23,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I have other things to talk about.

1058
01:03:23,085 --> 01:03:24,086
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, you better bring it.

1059
01:03:25,148 --> 01:03:26,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know I changed my location in SHJ.

1060
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:31,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Dang it, now I forgot.

1061
01:03:31,693 --> 01:03:32,514
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I have it.

1062
01:03:32,634 --> 01:03:33,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hang up.

1063
01:03:33,335 --> 01:03:33,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1064
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:36,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Kingdom Hearts 2.

1065
01:03:36,377 --> 01:03:37,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I beat it yesterday.

1066
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:38,959
[SPEAKER_08]: You beat Kingdom Hearts 2 already?

1067
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:39,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1068
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:40,660
[SPEAKER_08]: How is the ending?

1069
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,043
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you spoil it, I'll fly out to New Connecticut and choke you.

1070
01:03:45,164 --> 01:03:45,744
[SPEAKER_03]: How is the ending?

1071
01:03:46,565 --> 01:03:47,206
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.

1072
01:03:47,386 --> 01:03:50,488
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of similar to the first one, though.

1073
01:03:50,768 --> 01:03:53,731
[SPEAKER_03]: In the sense that it ends with the king sending him a letter.

1074
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:56,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I said don't ruin the damn ending!

1075
01:03:56,883 --> 01:03:57,663
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a spoiler, dude.

1076
01:03:57,723 --> 01:03:58,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1077
01:03:58,364 --> 01:03:59,084
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a spoiler.

1078
01:03:59,184 --> 01:03:59,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fine.

1079
01:04:00,544 --> 01:04:02,084
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, it's good.

1080
01:04:03,264 --> 01:04:04,785
[SPEAKER_03]: The last boss battle is very good.

1081
01:04:05,005 --> 01:04:07,905
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of had a Wind Waker-like vibe to it, in a way.

1082
01:04:09,966 --> 01:04:17,267
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the way you killed off Ganondorf in the end, it kind of had a similar, like, really flashy... Oh, you spoiled Wind Waker for me!

1083
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:17,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up!

1084
01:04:17,827 --> 01:04:19,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, was it worth the $50 you paid for it?

1085
01:04:25,817 --> 01:04:31,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I don't think many video games at all are worth $50, but I mean, I certainly had a great time with it.

1086
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:36,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe it was only like 30 hours, but, you know, it was a good 30 hours.

1087
01:04:37,203 --> 01:04:41,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there were a few bosses I didn't like, because they're really annoying.

1088
01:04:41,266 --> 01:04:42,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you spend three hours on the prologue?

1089
01:04:44,067 --> 01:04:44,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1090
01:04:44,527 --> 01:04:46,569
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means 10% of the game is the prologue?

1091
01:04:47,249 --> 01:04:47,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1092
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:48,650
[SPEAKER_08]: That's amazing.

1093
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:49,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Spike, you had a question?

1094
01:04:50,111 --> 01:04:54,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so my question for you is, did you get the hidden video at the end?

1095
01:04:55,382 --> 01:04:57,004
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I saw it before it even came out.

1096
01:04:58,465 --> 01:04:58,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.

1097
01:04:59,025 --> 01:04:59,646
[SPEAKER_03]: On the internet.

1098
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:08,494
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard it, it's, I can't even say, I don't want to spoil, but I heard it's what the hidden video in part one did for part two.

1099
01:05:09,095 --> 01:05:09,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Essentially.

1100
01:05:10,056 --> 01:05:12,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you banning me from asking my question on the air?

1101
01:05:12,218 --> 01:05:14,860
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot spoil the game or many people will kill you.

1102
01:05:17,075 --> 01:05:18,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Send Spike an email.

1103
01:05:18,076 --> 01:05:20,459
[SPEAKER_08]: You kids can Kingdom Hearts it out in email.

1104
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,063
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to see the secret ending, just go to YouTube.

1105
01:05:24,804 --> 01:05:25,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen it.

1106
01:05:26,061 --> 01:05:28,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Have some speculation about it.

1107
01:05:28,122 --> 01:05:29,142
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't spoil, though.

1108
01:05:29,683 --> 01:05:33,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you make it spoiler-free?

1109
01:05:33,344 --> 01:05:34,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you make it spoiler-free?

1110
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:35,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Somehow?

1111
01:05:36,205 --> 01:05:37,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be able to for what I want to say.

1112
01:05:38,286 --> 01:05:38,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1113
01:05:39,887 --> 01:05:42,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Xander, we gotta let you go before something gets spoiled, okay?

1114
01:05:43,629 --> 01:05:43,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1115
01:05:44,109 --> 01:05:44,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

1116
01:05:45,129 --> 01:05:45,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Ansem's still alive.

1117
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:49,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even hear what he said.

1118
01:05:49,271 --> 01:05:49,731
[SPEAKER_05]: What did he say?

1119
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:51,912
[SPEAKER_05]: He said Ansem's still alive.

1120
01:05:53,953 --> 01:05:54,453
[SPEAKER_08]: You dick.

1121
01:05:55,294 --> 01:05:55,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1122
01:05:58,129 --> 01:05:58,449
[SPEAKER_08]: I lied.

1123
01:05:58,469 --> 01:05:59,249
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do one more call.

1124
01:05:59,969 --> 01:06:01,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1125
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:04,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

1126
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:04,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I lied.

1127
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:05,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I lied.

1128
01:06:05,691 --> 01:06:06,791
[SPEAKER_08]: We decided to take one more call.

1129
01:06:06,811 --> 01:06:07,331
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

1130
01:06:10,151 --> 01:06:13,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Um... Well... Oh, yeah, that.

1131
01:06:13,872 --> 01:06:14,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sick.

1132
01:06:15,112 --> 01:06:16,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to hear that.

1133
01:06:16,133 --> 01:06:17,513
[SPEAKER_08]: What does that have to do with tonight's show?

1134
01:06:18,373 --> 01:06:19,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Um... No, I'm serious.

1135
01:06:19,153 --> 01:06:19,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Get better soon.

1136
01:06:20,053 --> 01:06:21,574
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, obviously something's going around.

1137
01:06:21,774 --> 01:06:22,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, seriously.

1138
01:06:22,374 --> 01:06:22,814
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

1139
01:06:24,094 --> 01:06:24,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1140
01:06:24,874 --> 01:06:25,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's bothering me.

1141
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:26,835
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys keep saying Yen.

1142
01:06:26,895 --> 01:06:27,435
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pronounced N.

1143
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:31,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the currency?

1144
01:06:32,091 --> 01:06:32,611
[SPEAKER_08]: In Japan?

1145
01:06:33,912 --> 01:06:36,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you see, I'm a honky who can't pronounce Japanese words right.

1146
01:06:37,032 --> 01:06:40,493
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to go out for some sushi?

1147
01:06:40,853 --> 01:06:42,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Want to go get some sushi?

1148
01:06:44,454 --> 01:06:45,715
[SPEAKER_08]: And some teriyaki?

1149
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:47,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I get some teriyaki chicken?

1150
01:06:51,156 --> 01:06:52,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, alright, so I make mistakes.

1151
01:06:53,077 --> 01:06:56,198
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, that's why I'm on the internet radio and not on real radio, okay?

1152
01:06:59,342 --> 01:07:01,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to say besides picking on me?

1153
01:07:02,204 --> 01:07:03,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, this is Nintendo Maniac 64.

1154
01:07:04,905 --> 01:07:05,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hi, Nintendo Maniac 64.

1155
01:07:06,325 --> 01:07:10,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Or as I say, Fever Maniac 64.

1156
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:13,328
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anything else on your mind tonight before I cut you off?

1157
01:07:13,908 --> 01:07:19,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, my DS charger cable I've modded so I have headphone jacks on the cord.

1158
01:07:19,971 --> 01:07:27,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I can plug in my AC adapter, a USB port, or get this, a mouse port plug.

1159
01:07:29,828 --> 01:07:31,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Resident Evil 4, bitch.

1160
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, yeah.

1161
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,562
[SPEAKER_08]: I spent 30 hours on Kingdom Hearts this week.

1162
01:07:57,422 --> 01:07:59,143
[SPEAKER_08]: My e-penis is huge.

1163
01:07:59,163 --> 01:08:00,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question for you.

1164
01:08:00,143 --> 01:08:00,903
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I love our fans.

1165
01:08:01,063 --> 01:08:01,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Loki.

1166
01:08:02,024 --> 01:08:06,966
[SPEAKER_09]: So, USB port and mouse port.

1167
01:08:08,607 --> 01:08:09,307
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the point?

1168
01:08:10,568 --> 01:08:11,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you can.

1169
01:08:11,348 --> 01:08:13,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you install Linux on a toaster?

1170
01:08:13,169 --> 01:08:13,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you can.

1171
01:08:13,869 --> 01:08:15,150
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can't hook up a mouse to it.

1172
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:16,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh?

1173
01:08:18,831 --> 01:08:22,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, like, if I install the cigarette lighter on my PSP.

1174
01:08:23,496 --> 01:08:24,216
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't smoke.

1175
01:08:24,997 --> 01:08:26,217
[SPEAKER_06]: But you would have it.

1176
01:08:28,598 --> 01:08:29,378
[SPEAKER_08]: For what?

1177
01:08:30,118 --> 01:08:33,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're going to go around and get tonight's last minute stories.

1178
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Any last minute things people want to bring up?

1179
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you seem to always have something.

1180
01:08:37,921 --> 01:08:42,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was going to mention there was some rumor stuff I was reading.

1181
01:08:42,963 --> 01:08:47,485
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them saying that Final Fantasy 7, the remake, is in production for the PS3 right now.

1182
01:08:48,408 --> 01:09:02,585
[SPEAKER_09]: that they're trying to also secure the rights for Grand Theft Auto the next Grand Theft Auto for the 360 to be exclusive which is not going to happen and oh god what was the other one that's all I got so far

1183
01:09:04,002 --> 01:09:06,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I have a real last minute story here.

1184
01:09:06,924 --> 01:09:09,445
[SPEAKER_08]: This is coming to us from GK128 in the chat room.

1185
01:09:09,465 --> 01:09:11,487
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a post over on Nintendo forums.

1186
01:09:11,767 --> 01:09:17,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Rumor is going around that Blue Wave may perhaps be the real name of the revolution.

1187
01:09:18,231 --> 01:09:20,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Take into consideration the revolution has a blue light.

1188
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:23,054
[SPEAKER_08]: There's waving the controller.

1189
01:09:23,094 --> 01:09:25,555
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the blue ocean thing people have been talking about.

1190
01:09:26,016 --> 01:09:28,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Competition to Blu-ray perhaps.

1191
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:34,762
[SPEAKER_08]: This leak is coming from some type of audio link there from YourFileHost.com Check that out in our chat room.

1192
01:09:34,802 --> 01:09:35,842
[SPEAKER_08]: We just posted the link there.

1193
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:38,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure if this is true, there will be plenty of more news about it in the next week.

1194
01:09:39,385 --> 01:09:43,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, take it as a rumor, the name of the revolution to be the Blue Wave, possibly.

1195
01:09:44,048 --> 01:09:44,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1196
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:45,469
[SPEAKER_08]: You're retarded sounding.

1197
01:09:45,509 --> 01:09:46,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1198
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:47,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see it.

1199
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:47,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see that.

1200
01:09:49,512 --> 01:09:51,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's as retarded as you're making it out to me.

1201
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:52,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Spike?

1202
01:09:52,834 --> 01:09:54,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like the name Revolution.

1203
01:09:55,055 --> 01:09:55,515
[SPEAKER_08]: I do too.

1204
01:09:55,995 --> 01:09:57,075
[SPEAKER_08]: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

1205
01:09:57,215 --> 01:09:58,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that should be the name of it too.

1206
01:10:00,157 --> 01:10:02,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because it's revolutionary.

1207
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:05,839
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, I don't know, you can revolve the controller around.

1208
01:10:06,259 --> 01:10:08,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing little quotation marks with my fingers here.

1209
01:10:09,161 --> 01:10:12,142
[SPEAKER_06]: It's catchy and buzzy.

1210
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's exactly what Nintendo needs to turn their image around.

1211
01:10:15,884 --> 01:10:18,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that's going to make people say, hey, wait, this is different.

1212
01:10:19,858 --> 01:10:20,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Possibly.

1213
01:10:21,059 --> 01:10:21,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other last-minute stories?

1214
01:10:22,379 --> 01:10:23,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Spike, do you have something?

1215
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:29,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, on Friday, actually, Capcom announced the Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded.

1216
01:10:29,623 --> 01:10:33,686
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the follow-up compilation disc for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

1217
01:10:34,966 --> 01:10:39,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, the titles that have been announced for it are Eco Fighters, King of Dragons, Knights of the Round.

1218
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:45,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, it looks like some Commando, Ghouls and Ghosts, and Street Fighter II.

1219
01:10:45,312 --> 01:10:47,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1220
01:10:47,728 --> 01:10:49,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of those games were in the last one.

1221
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:50,151
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of weird.

1222
01:10:50,632 --> 01:10:53,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get this press release, but it's there on the internet.

1223
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:56,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Kotaku posted a link, IGN posted a link.

1224
01:10:57,901 --> 01:11:02,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Seems pretty kosher, but... Resident Evil 4, bitch.

1225
01:11:03,388 --> 01:11:04,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Resident Evil 4, bitch.

1226
01:11:05,691 --> 01:11:06,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other last minute stories?

1227
01:11:08,339 --> 01:11:10,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the one I have.

1228
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:10,540
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1229
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:16,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to say really quick, because somebody in the chat room reminded me to mention our panels at Fanime.

1230
01:11:16,602 --> 01:11:17,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we are going to be going to Fanime.

1231
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:19,864
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing panels that's still in the works.

1232
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:21,604
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura would know more about that.

1233
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:24,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a reminder, that's Memorial Day weekend.

1234
01:11:24,426 --> 01:11:28,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only are we going to be there, but Spike, you're going to Fanime as well, correct?

1235
01:11:28,807 --> 01:11:29,348
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to be there?

1236
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:30,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1237
01:11:30,108 --> 01:11:31,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm there just about every year.

1238
01:11:31,508 --> 01:11:32,829
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll be at our panels as well?

1239
01:11:34,318 --> 01:11:34,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully.

1240
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:35,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1241
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:35,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Please.

1242
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1243
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,762
[SPEAKER_08]: And, well, you'll at least be there.

1244
01:11:37,842 --> 01:11:39,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what we're doing for them yet.

1245
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:40,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be present.

1246
01:11:40,165 --> 01:11:41,266
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll be there to sign autographs.

1247
01:11:41,686 --> 01:11:43,589
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully some of our other regulars.

1248
01:11:43,629 --> 01:11:48,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Extrofer will probably be there, and maybe we can get Miklatop to come with us, too.

1249
01:11:48,694 --> 01:11:49,035
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

1250
01:11:49,495 --> 01:11:51,478
[SPEAKER_08]: But that'll all go down at Foundame.

1251
01:11:51,498 --> 01:11:52,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I have one more thing.

1252
01:11:52,879 --> 01:11:53,079
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1253
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:53,600
[SPEAKER_08]: One more.

1254
01:11:54,013 --> 01:11:56,876
[SPEAKER_09]: This is basically coming from the new issue of Game Informer.

1255
01:11:57,717 --> 01:12:02,101
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, they're sticking by their information that the new Halo game is going to be called Forerunner.

1256
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:09,269
[SPEAKER_09]: They also revealed that a Project Orion is in existence.

1257
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:14,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, it's supposed to be a team put together to explore the possibility of a Halo MMO.

1258
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:17,357
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still in the planning stages.

1259
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:18,762
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's going ahead.

1260
01:12:19,762 --> 01:12:30,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, the Final Fantasy 7 remake for the PlayStation 3 is supposed to be going to have the Final Fantasy 12 action battle system in there.

1261
01:12:30,569 --> 01:12:32,591
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're going to be in a real-time battle.

1262
01:12:34,172 --> 01:12:36,373
[SPEAKER_09]: All rumors until we see some actual details.

1263
01:12:37,214 --> 01:12:37,494
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1264
01:12:38,773 --> 01:12:45,338
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about going to wrap it up for tonight's program, but not before we get to the last story of the evening, which comes to us from Loki.

1265
01:12:46,178 --> 01:12:50,101
[SPEAKER_08]: We were going to make Jamie talk about this, but maybe this is why she called in tonight.

1266
01:12:50,121 --> 01:12:50,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1267
01:12:50,661 --> 01:12:55,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I wanted to first real quick before I go over the last story, I just want to mention what's coming out this week.

1268
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:56,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sure.

1269
01:12:57,566 --> 01:13:04,771
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are a PC gamer fan, they have Auto Assault Online Limited Edition with some bonus stuff.

1270
01:13:04,911 --> 01:13:07,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Condemned is finally coming out on the PC.

1271
01:13:08,533 --> 01:13:09,555
[SPEAKER_09]: GameCube has Odama

1272
01:13:24,793 --> 01:13:28,235
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1273
01:13:55,353 --> 01:14:02,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, on the PSP, we have the Silent Hill Experience coming out that coincided with the movie released next week.

1274
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:03,677
[SPEAKER_09]: They must have bumped that up.

1275
01:14:04,457 --> 01:14:05,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe they have.

1276
01:14:06,918 --> 01:14:14,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Silent Hill Experience, I thought around that time was supposed to be not the Silent Hill Experience, but the collection.

1277
01:14:15,141 --> 01:14:15,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1278
01:14:15,602 --> 01:14:18,783
[SPEAKER_09]: But I haven't really heard anything official on that, so I don't know.

1279
01:14:18,923 --> 01:14:19,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1280
01:14:20,103 --> 01:14:21,624
[SPEAKER_09]: So look for that.

1281
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:23,105
[SPEAKER_09]: See if it's coming.

1282
01:14:24,707 --> 01:14:25,908
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1283
01:14:51,229 --> 01:14:55,570
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're over in the UK, you've got coming out this week on the 13th, Dragon Quest, Journey of the Cursed King.

1284
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:57,591
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're an RPG fan, you must get this.

1285
01:14:57,671 --> 01:15:12,716
[SPEAKER_08]: PlayStation 2, Mega Man Battle Network 5, Double Team coming out on the DS, The Sims 2 expansion, Family Fun Stuff on the PC, Auto Assault also making its way to the PC, and Sega's bringing out Football Manager 2006 on the Xbox 360 and the PSP.

1286
01:15:12,776 --> 01:15:15,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that is the hard drive required title.

1287
01:15:15,197 --> 01:15:16,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.

1288
01:15:16,097 --> 01:15:16,337
[SPEAKER_08]: 360, isn't it?

1289
01:15:16,397 --> 01:15:16,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1290
01:15:17,278 --> 01:15:20,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week, you guys have to look forward to Final Fantasy XI on PC and Xbox.

1291
01:15:21,159 --> 01:15:24,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox 360, that would be the treasures of Ot Organ, of course.

1292
01:15:24,742 --> 01:15:29,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yes, that's right, that is coming out next week for, no, no, I'm sorry, that is the following week.

1293
01:15:29,867 --> 01:15:30,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's the following week.

1294
01:15:30,807 --> 01:15:40,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm into the week of the 20th and 21st, and on the 21st you guys are getting Electroplankton over in the UK, Tamagotchi on the DS, and Tetris DS is also making its way to the DS.

1295
01:15:40,356 --> 01:15:43,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Might I also say on the 20th you guys are scheduled to get 99 Nights.

1296
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:46,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Lucky, we're not getting that for a while.

1297
01:15:47,288 --> 01:15:49,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe that, but we'll see.

1298
01:15:49,549 --> 01:15:51,029
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what the list says.

1299
01:15:51,089 --> 01:15:51,809
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm reading.

1300
01:15:51,949 --> 01:15:53,369
[SPEAKER_08]: So take that with a grain of salt.

1301
01:15:53,409 --> 01:15:55,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Big grain of salt.

1302
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:56,410
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, that's what the list says.

1303
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:57,470
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just what I'm reading off of.

1304
01:15:58,531 --> 01:15:59,231
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1305
01:15:59,251 --> 01:16:04,152
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not uncommon for folks in the UK to once in a while get a game before us, so I wouldn't completely disregard that.

1306
01:16:04,172 --> 01:16:05,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, who's bringing that over?

1307
01:16:05,052 --> 01:16:07,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if that might be Ubisoft, they might be releasing it.

1308
01:16:07,273 --> 01:16:08,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I closed the list.

1309
01:16:08,653 --> 01:16:10,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is Ubisoft.

1310
01:16:10,173 --> 01:16:11,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shoot.

1311
01:16:12,314 --> 01:16:12,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1312
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:13,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

1313
01:16:14,005 --> 01:16:15,986
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, hold on, I'm looking.

1314
01:16:16,026 --> 01:16:21,207
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got, Microsoft is publishing it.

1315
01:16:21,607 --> 01:16:23,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh, that's interesting.

1316
01:16:23,468 --> 01:16:23,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1317
01:16:24,868 --> 01:16:27,929
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, now we're going to get into the final story of the night.

1318
01:16:30,609 --> 01:16:32,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we have a comment in our chat room there.

1319
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:39,206
[SPEAKER_08]: BlackWolf in our chatroom says 99 Nights is coming out in Japan on April 20th, not Europe.

1320
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:41,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that's more correct.

1321
01:16:41,508 --> 01:16:43,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm reading the list.

1322
01:16:43,109 --> 01:16:43,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just reading the list.

1323
01:16:44,009 --> 01:16:45,410
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going with Japan.

1324
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:46,371
[SPEAKER_09]: So I made a mistake.

1325
01:16:47,892 --> 01:16:49,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, last story of the night.

1326
01:16:49,713 --> 01:16:49,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1327
01:16:51,758 --> 01:16:54,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we've seen a lot of weird things come out.

1328
01:16:55,079 --> 01:17:11,226
[SPEAKER_09]: This, I don't think it actually ties in with the actual game, but if you're in Japan and you happen to be near a Japanese sex toy shop, you can find a Kingdom Hearts vibrator.

1329
01:17:13,867 --> 01:17:15,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, the Kingdom Hearts AC.

1330
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:19,892
[SPEAKER_09]: It's selling a Kingdom Hearts branded rabbit vibrator.

1331
01:17:19,913 --> 01:17:29,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, it doesn't look like it has anything to do with Kingdom Hearts, except for the name, maybe a brand name or something.

1332
01:17:31,461 --> 01:17:36,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Something to get those Kingdom Hearts hardcore fans out there that they might not already own.

1333
01:17:36,545 --> 01:17:38,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you too can join Organization 69.

1334
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:42,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I want one.

1335
01:17:42,889 --> 01:17:44,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Put this on your little black hood.

1336
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:51,741
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something to get those people that have the trans vibrator and can't think of anything else gaming related to get.

1337
01:17:51,761 --> 01:17:53,201
[SPEAKER_08]: This reminds me of the Hello Kitty vibrator.

1338
01:17:54,861 --> 01:17:59,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know how long it's going to take for fan art with Keyblades with these dangling from the end on the chain.

1339
01:18:00,423 --> 01:18:00,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1340
01:18:01,863 --> 01:18:05,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dirty Thief just got the quote of the show there in our chat room.

1341
01:18:05,904 --> 01:18:08,645
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Keyblade that unlocks your pleasure.

1342
01:18:10,694 --> 01:18:11,814
[SPEAKER_08]: They win at the internet.

1343
01:18:12,114 --> 01:18:15,075
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Dirty Thief ought to be marketing this show to the masses out there.

1344
01:18:15,435 --> 01:18:19,216
[SPEAKER_08]: And please, if you guys do want to market the show to the masses, we really appreciate it.

1345
01:18:19,256 --> 01:18:21,496
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only way we get big is word of mouth.

1346
01:18:21,836 --> 01:18:25,497
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have no big magazine company backing our show.

1347
01:18:25,857 --> 01:18:28,958
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have no big website that backs our show.

1348
01:18:28,998 --> 01:18:30,318
[SPEAKER_08]: We are independent.

1349
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:31,678
[SPEAKER_08]: We're as independent as it gets.

1350
01:18:31,738 --> 01:18:36,159
[SPEAKER_08]: We are out of the spare bedroom of my apartment doing this program, and we need word of mouth.

1351
01:18:36,539 --> 01:18:37,940
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, I'm wagging my face.

1352
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,743
[SPEAKER_08]: The way your head is moving, I wish I could show the audience at all.

1353
01:18:40,763 --> 01:18:42,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're hoping to do the video thing soon enough.

1354
01:18:42,965 --> 01:18:44,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry I didn't get any video this time.

1355
01:18:44,687 --> 01:18:46,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, there wasn't anything.

1356
01:18:46,449 --> 01:18:50,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just check it out on olrpsp.com and huge, huge video things to come.

1357
01:18:50,713 --> 01:18:51,734
[SPEAKER_08]: We're very, very excited.

1358
01:18:52,975 --> 01:18:54,256
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess that's that.

1359
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:56,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1360
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Your final thought, Spike.

1361
01:18:59,389 --> 01:18:59,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great week.

1362
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:01,431
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1363
01:19:01,451 --> 01:19:03,513
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:23,451
