00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,480
Now the conclusion of this weekÃ­s episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:26,480
And we're back here live on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 180 for this April the 9th of 2006.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,480
Loki would like to begin this segment with a small correction, wouldn't you, Loki?

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,480
Yes, I would. Yes, about those numbers about the Revolution launch title, I was a little off.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
A little?

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,480
Yeah, I was a bit off, okay.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:47,480
Actually, coming from Gamefront, the true number is 20 titles, one third of which are said to be developed by Nintendo themselves.

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,480
so I was close I had the number 20 in there and there's a percentage

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,160
which means Orange Lounge Radio will be Puddin' Free

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,200
for those who listen to Part A thankfully. Damn. Hooray!

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,920
My dignity is spared another day. Still better coverage than IGN

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,320
Can I say that? I don't know

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,360
Moving on, if you can address those cards and letters too. What is your email?

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,560
You don't have an Orange Lounge Radio account do you? No. We need to get you one.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,720
We'll get you one. Remind me to hook you up with one after the show. We'll hook you up with a spike

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,120
at Orange Lawn Radio email. I'll take you up on that. Alright, sounds good.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,480
Now, in the first segment, did anybody notice in the first segment of tonight's show, not a single

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,920
story on Sony PlayStation?

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,520
Because everything's been quiet on the PS3 front this week pretty much, hasn't it?

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah. Well, there was one little thing, right, Loki?

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,420
Yeah, let's see here.

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,600
Basically, according to some French

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,360
radio show, there was an interview done where it was leaked out,

28
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:53,360
I guess that the Playstation 3 would be somewhere between the price point of 499,599 euros in the UK.

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,360
So everyone's speculating, oh my god, it's going to be 650 dollars, 700 some dollars here, not the case.

30
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Actually a lot of times the price point over there, they will get screwed over because their price point will be, for example for the Xbox 360,

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,280
I believe their price point is 399 euros for the premium system, whereas we were $399.

32
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:23,100
So maybe $499 to $599, I'm thinking more about $499, that's probably going to be the price

33
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,680
point in the US.

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,720
I think $499 is a reasonable price point for the US too.

35
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,640
I thought it was very interesting though, because this news kind of came out early in

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,680
the week, and A, people ran with this saying that PS3 price announced, and first off I

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,000
was thinking, okay, no, price was not announced.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,920
Some guy made an inadvertent comment that may or may not even be the truth.

39
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,680
I know that this guy was a Sony exec or whatever, but with all due respect to Europe, Europe

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,120
is not where the magic is happening right now in regards to PlayStation 3.

41
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,240
The magic will happen there soon enough, but that's not where the systems are being made.

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,400
Had this slip come from Sony in Japan, maybe I would have been a little more apt to believe

43
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
it.

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,640
But then how people suddenly made this direct conversion of Euros to dollars.

45
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,240
right and completely disregarded the fact that usually the UK folks get

46
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,320
screwed when it comes to price I'm very sorry you guys it's just the fact you

47
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,680
guys kind of get screwed so sorry not always though sometimes they get games

48
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,120
around the same price but a lot of times they do get screwed and you know that

49
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,960
means that usually the amount that we pay in dollars they pay in euros is

50
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,660
usually about the conversion so I think you're right $4.99 to $5.99 is more of a

51
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,960
realistic point but again we've got the revolution and the 360 to compete with

52
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,860
and unless you can sell me that I cannot live without blu-ray I don't think it's

53
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,920
realistic to release your system for $5.99 unless you can somehow convince me

54
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,460
that blu-ray will change my life do my dishes walk the dog and the whole nine

55
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,880
yards this yeah I mean the system looks great I'm you know graphically it looks

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:04,280
awesome gameplay we don't know we don't know we don't really know anything yet

57
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,760
well just talking about the titles that they've announced so far they don't seem

58
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,460
It's it's you know, the same game Microsoft's playing. Let's make the games prettier and not change anything because hey it worked before

59
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,660
so

60
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,900
Yeah, but take a game like oblivion oblivion could not have been done on the regular Xbox

61
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,460
I mean not all it's it's so vast and it's so pretty

62
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,500
I mean that's really a next-gen game right there. Did you spend much time with Morrowind?

63
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Not a lot, but I'd seen it. It felt the same game, just not as pretty.

64
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,500
But if we're talking about gameplay, I wouldn't argue that there's a big difference there.

65
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Alright. Oblivion feels really big, and with everything that they're saying you can do with it, and just all the vastness.

66
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:59,500
One part I didn't see in the other game was, I didn't see character creation. Was it as thorough in that game? I don't know. Maybe it was.

67
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,060
I seem to recall that it was. It's been, you know,

68
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,660
a good minute, but I do think so. I'm sure people in our chat room will be able to

69
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,980
help out there. Orangelaunchradio.com. Click on chat

70
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,100
if you want. Okay, so

71
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,100
whatever. Moving on.

72
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,420
One thing you will not see on the PlayStation 3 is anything coming from

73
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,260
Lionhead Studios, that's for sure. You know why?

74
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,780
Microsoft bottom. Yes, they announced earlier this week that the folks who

75
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:35,340
made black and white and fable they just got bought by Microsoft that would be

76
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,500
lion head studios so those types of games of course it's not really too

77
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,820
surprising when you consider that fable was such a treasured Xbox game and a

78
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,260
Xbox exclusive as well but who knows what that could mean for Xbox's future

79
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,180
Loki what do you think about that news yeah yeah whatever Microsoft is

80
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,620
absorbing companies now, so, Spike?

81
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,100
I feel similarly about this, about how I feel about their acquisition of Rare.

82
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:10,180
They make one pretty trophy title a game every year or two, but overall I don't see Alty

83
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,020
Lionhead as a big, you know, industry-changing, challenging force.

84
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,740
But it only takes a handful of those trophy games to sell your system, ask Nintendo.

85
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,620
That's a very valid point.

86
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,540
Although, I don't really count Fable as a very great game.

87
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,700
The only reason Fable was so freaking great was because there wasn't anything else like

88
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,380
it on the Xbox.

89
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,700
Go over to Playstation 2, Gamecube, you got plenty of games like Fable.

90
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,260
Although, to Fable's credit, it was a little more expansive than most games in the way

91
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,020
that you could control your character's fate.

92
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,780
Not that we hadn't seen it before, but it was so fluid and it was such a turning point

93
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,200
of the game, I don't think you really saw that in the other systems.

94
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,020
But you're right, the gameplay itself was kind of butt-mashing, was the fighting, you

95
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,180
know, it wasn't anything that revolutionary, you know, but it still was really the only

96
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,020
game like it on the Xbox, and for that reason.

97
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,460
And I would argue the same thing is happening with Oblivion.

98
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,940
I think the only reason Oblivion is doing so phenomenally is it's got no competition

99
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,580
on the 360 right now, nothing, there is no game even remotely close to what Oblivion

100
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,580
is like.

101
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,460
wrong I'm sure it's a great game that would be good even if there was

102
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,300
competition but still I think the only reason why I see half my friends list

103
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,980
playing this game is because I know my friends a lot of them are into

104
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,460
role-playing games there's nothing else for them to play on 360 right now yep

105
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:43,520
just my thought all right let's go on to another story Loki what's this about the

106
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,500
Xbox Live Arcade it's getting some new games that's for sure starting off here

107
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:57,040
with Cloning Clyde, which sounds pretty weird, but basically they're keying this as it's

108
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,220
going to be a completely unique 3D adventure and puzzle game that may bring a new meaning

109
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,300
to the word schizophrenic.

110
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:10,820
So basically Clyde was an ordinary but slightly dim guy before DupliClone Inc. paid him $20

111
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:16,880
to take part in a cloning experiment, and I guess, you know, things go crazy from there.

112
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,580
And so, yeah, it's going to be coming to the live arcade.

113
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:28,060
It is made by a company called Ninjabi, who you might remember did Outpost Clokey X, which

114
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:34,860
is a pretty big hit on Xbox Live, so, you know, check it out when it comes out.

115
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,100
I think I read somewhere this is supposed to be the Geometry Wars.

116
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
I don't think so.

117
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,100
The next Geometry Wars.

118
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,380
I think every Xbox Live title is going to call itself that though.

119
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,360
The next Geometry Wars.

120
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,880
trended over its geometry wars is simple that's you know what it comes down to

121
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,280
you know what the next geometry wars was was crystal quest because I swear those

122
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,800
games are very very similar not totally but very similar and same with feeding

123
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,360
friends well no I guess you don't have a gun and feeding friends but just I don't

124
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,920
know that whole dodging how about me feels a little similar was it a mutant

125
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,760
storm I haven't even played that there's also robot Ron now wait a minute robot

126
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Robotron is a classic.

127
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,000
I mean a classic classic.

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You can't...

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,680
Yeah, but I'm saying that they're all...

130
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Well, yeah, Smash TV.

131
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
I'm not saying that.

132
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,160
Robotron is more like Smash TV, if anything else, but both were made by the same company,

133
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,200
so you could almost say that Smash TV, in an effed up way, is like Robotron.

134
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,480
Maybe I'm just crazy.

135
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,600
We mentioned in part A that you can get brand new outfits for Cameo.

136
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,480
You can dress them up as Orchid and Killer Instinct characters and all those other things,

137
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,280
But also one thing that should be noted about Cameo, they just patched their co-op mode

138
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,600
and now you can do the online co-op play with Cameo and I believe new achievements come

139
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,920
with this as well, but here's the thing.

140
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,100
Because Cameo has already hit their limit of a thousand achievement points, now there

141
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,080
are zero point achievements that you can get in Cameo with this new patch is what I'm hearing.

142
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,280
You get achievements but they're not worth anything.

143
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,540
Who cares?

144
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,540
That's dead to me.

145
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,540
Well, some people really wanted to do co-op and cameo, so...

146
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,540
You know, I'm telling you, what they should do then is still give you the co-op achievements.

147
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,540
Who cares if you play over live? Just do the same co-op achievements that they have in the game.

148
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,540
Just, you know, now you can play live or local.

149
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,540
And Hitstun says the online co-op patch is free, right? Yes, that is true, it is free.

150
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,540
Yes.

151
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,540
So, enjoy the free things while you can. I'm sure as soon as you put in cameo...

152
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,540
I haven't patched mine yet, but I'm sure as soon as you put in cameo, it'll say,

153
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,380
say an upgrade for this game is now available yay and then it'll just patch

154
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,180
patch its way onto your hard drive that is assuming you have a hard drive then

155
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:49,180
we can be underwhelmed with people on the internet at the same time you know

156
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,460
what just made that made me think of though what happens if you don't have a

157
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,420
hard drive are you just screwed are you gonna have to patch this game every time

158
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,940
well you can maybe download the patch to your memory card oh I guess that's a

159
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,500
good point I guess you could save it to your memory cards how are you gonna you

160
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,820
play anything with a memory card. I know. Memory card was just useless. It's just something

161
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,380
that they put out there and say, you know what, hey, there's an option to buying the,

162
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,860
you know. No, you can take your memory card to an Xbox 360 kiosk and get Uber special

163
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:22,580
downloads. That don't work! By the way, where the fuck is my goddamn burnout card that they

164
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,780
promised me months ago that I download it from the kiosk and then we go to play burnout.

165
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:33,460
Oh, by the way, it doesn't work! Oh, did we say working car? I don't believe we did. So,

166
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,460
You know what? You're fucked!

167
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,460
I love setting him off.

168
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,460
Stupid kiosk thing.

169
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,460
Why'd I spend the money on that stupid card? I don't know.

170
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,460
Loki, what's next on the news?

171
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:55,460
Seriously? Well, the Michigan game law was ruled unconstitutional.

172
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,460
Like, we didn't see that coming.

173
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,460
So yeah, basically thrown out because, yeah, it's unconstitutional blah blah blah.

174
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,700
was the Michigan law like the California law or what was the deal there

175
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,140
uh... Beyonce I don't know if it was very similar or not I imagine they're

176
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,300
probably pretty close

177
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,940
uh...

178
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,740
I don't know it's

179
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,980
they really shouldn't try to regulate the game sales and stuff

180
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,180
it was summed up intended to restrict the sale of certain games to minors and they

181
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,580
say that was unconstitutional and can't be implemented so it sounds pretty similar to what we

182
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,900
had going on in California here exactly in fact I think that they should be able to

183
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,900
to sell porn to minors too now because it's unconstitutional.

184
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,140
Stop. Children have the right to porn.

185
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,180
Have you no dignity?

186
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,540
Have you no dignity? I don't.

187
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,620
There's this new, we were talking about Xbox Live just a minute ago, there's a new

188
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,660
application created by NimbleSoft

189
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,780
and they created this small application saying that since they're such fanboys

190
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,080
of the Xbox 360 they wrote this application.

191
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,320
360 Friends is an Xbox Live friendless

192
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,720
notifier. It'll tell you who's online, who's offline,

193
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,840
let you view gamer cards, and notify when a friend's

194
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,280
status changes. You can even have it in a little taskbar and it'll actually

195
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,520
alert you when people sign on and offline.

196
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,000
I guess what it's doing is it's kind of borrowing from exactly what Xbox

197
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,440
Live, or I'm sorry, Xbox.com does, but it sort of delivers that news

198
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,160
to your desktop. So you can see when, you know, if you're stalking someone, you can

199
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,440
see right when they come online.

200
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,360
so it's pretty cool so like I'd be able to see if Loki's online from my computer

201
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,280
excellent if I if I'm too lazy to access xbox.com

202
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,720
yes I'm surprised Microsoft didn't I think the most surprising thing about this

203
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,520
story is that someone beat Microsoft to it

204
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,700
I think if I were Microsoft right now I'd be kinda I'd be one to buy

205
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,120
the software from this guy or acquire this guy

206
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,760
no they would just want to sue him. Why? Because they're Microsoft and they can't.

207
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,680
Why would you sue this guy? He wrote a practical useful application that

208
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,640
adds value to the 360. All the more reason to sue him!

209
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,520
Maybe they should put out an ad in PC Gamer about how wrong this is and that

210
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,920
people should buy the software from Microsoft.

211
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,280
Microsoft doesn't have the software, that's the point. It's probably gonna be in

212
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,120
Vista whenever the hell that comes out.

213
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,120
GK128 in the chat room says, I have 360 friends,

214
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,200
the program. It's cool but it hogs RAM.

215
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,180
So it might be a little bit of a memory hog. So have a lot of RAM if you're gonna be

216
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,000
using this program.

217
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,520
but you know also it's it's a program that has

218
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,560
you know it's it's written by you know

219
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,680
a fan essentially so it's probably not optimized yet

220
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,840
it means the first release it sounds like so if this guy continues decides to

221
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,440
continue to

222
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,560
upgrade this it might get a little better in that regard yeah

223
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,720
gk 128 would like to point out uses 63 megabytes of RAM currently

224
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,240
mmm very interesting

225
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,640
interesting alright moving on

226
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Loki, you have some music game news.

227
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Yes, In The Groove, PlayStation 2.

228
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,320
As I've been stating before, this game is merely Stepmania.

229
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,640
And now, like Stepmania, you can put your own songs in it for the PlayStation 2.

230
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,520
However, of course, the tools have been out there already to unpack everything that's

231
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,800
in The Groove for the PlayStation 2 and actually dump that stuff to your hard drive so you

232
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,240
can play the official songs because they're just step mania files. Well now they have

233
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,960
the tools to repack it so you can actually put whatever songs you want in there and be

234
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,480
able to burn it to a disc and either play it with any sort of tools that you use to

235
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,880
play backup discs on a Playstation 2 or hacks or workarounds or whatever. So I guess that's

236
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,540
pretty cool. One of the reasons why, I don't understand why people pay for step mania,

237
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:54,540
But now you can, and I'm just not surprised. I knew this was going to come one of these

238
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,340
days and now that it's available, that's kind of neat. You get to play all your songs, if

239
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,140
you like In the Groove songs, go ahead and play the In the Groove songs, if you like DDR.

240
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,340
Yeah, because you put DDR songs in the Groove?

241
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,260
They had it! DDR, all the DDR songs in the Groove 2, and In the Groove songs, all in one

242
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,780
disc. So they had all this stuff in there.

243
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,180
Can you just download this from the website, burn it, and ready to go?

244
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,100
I don't know, it's not available on the website, you gotta dig for it and unfortunately I cannot

245
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:27,460
give out where it is, but you know, if your local Balmani downloading ISO place will probably

246
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:37,100
have it, you know, BitTorrent, that type of thing, so look for it and have fun I guess.

247
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,800
Very interesting.

248
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,060
Moving on, a follow up to a story we were talking about a few weeks ago, remember the

249
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:49,060
a town in Ohio that got slammed on April Fools.

250
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,340
Actually, we may not have done this on the last podcast.

251
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,260
This may have been my spinoff show I did on Wednesday.

252
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,520
I talked about this story about the girls

253
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,760
who played the prank in the town

254
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,440
and had little question mark blocks.

255
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,280
They hung around the town.

256
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,140
The bomb squad had to be called in

257
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,940
because they thought that they might actually be bombed.

258
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,020
Did they think they were getting attacked by the Riddler?

259
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,180
Possibly because of the big question marks on them.

260
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,260
I don't know.

261
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,300
But apparently this was like a thing

262
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,680
that they were doing across the nation

263
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,120
was these little question mark blocks, it was a little game, well you know those girls

264
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,480
were in big freaking trouble when they did this.

265
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,480
They were not going to have charges pressed against them, basically according to the county

266
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,560
prosecutor these girls, quote, were not thinking about the consequences of their actions in

267
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:36,200
this day and age, so if you plan on painting the town Mario, think twice because you might

268
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
be labeled a terrorist.

269
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,000
Well that and the fact that they didn't really break any laws, so what are you going to do?

270
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm arresting you for scaring me!

271
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Wait, hold on though, you know, in this day and age, can you really leave a suspicious box?

272
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Most people don't know what a question mark block reference is, and you're right,

273
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
they probably think about Batman or something, you know?

274
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah, I'm gonna blow up this street light.

275
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Al-Qaeda will strike us in our street lights!

276
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh my, now the FBI's gonna monitor this program, thank you very much.

277
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You jerk.

278
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,160
I kind of agree though, it's an iconic symbol, I can't help but think

279
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,600
three out of three people in this room are going to know

280
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,520
what that question mark is. Back to the OLR statistics magic, right?

281
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,840
So a hundred percent of Americans know what a question mark block is and shouldn't have

282
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,400
been alarmed,

283
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,400
right? This is what I'm saying. Alright. But really the percentage must be over

284
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,320
fifty percent.

285
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,120
I can't help but believe that this... Not if you're an old person!

286
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,640
So your grandmother wouldn't know what a question mark block is?

287
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,080
Probably, unless my grandma happened to be old granny hardcore, probably not.

288
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,860
No, my grandma would have no idea what a question mark block is.

289
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,600
She would have no idea. She would probably think about

290
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,840
Frank Gorshin from Batman, the Riddler.

291
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,560
That was my Riddler impersonation. That was great, huh?

292
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,580
I worked on that all day. I stand corrected. Alright,

293
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,340
Maybe we won't be in so much trouble if we find a cure for cancer, right Loki?

294
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,260
Yes, in the meantime though you can play a game called Remission

295
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:13,020
where you can blow a cancer. Yes, in this game basically you play a

296
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,540
micro robot by the name of

297
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,300
I believe Roxy and

298
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,740
you are basically in the body

299
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,500
and destroying these rapidly multiplying rogue cells.

300
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:34,180
And, basically, it's something that I've kind of done to help cancer patients cope with

301
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:44,180
their illness while educating them and increasing players' sense of control over their circumstances.

302
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,180
That's great.

303
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,940
Unfortunately, though, it should be mentioned that this game does not cure cancer.

304
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,900
Just clear up anything because, you know, there's a lot of stupid people out there.

305
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,340
You know what it kind of sounds like to me?

306
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,460
It's like that old game that would be like the tooth fighter, the cavity fighting game.

307
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,900
I remember I had this on Commodore 64 and you carried around the giant toothbrush and

308
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,540
you had to wipe the plaque or you'd get attacked by the little cavity monsters.

309
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,140
That's what this sounds like to me, except instead of teeth, it's cancer.

310
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,420
Cancer patients will get to play crappy games now, as if they weren't tortured enough about

311
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,940
you know the fact that you know their cancer might not be you know operable

312
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,620
grave

313
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,540
it's like yeah you know that cure cancer

314
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,460
we couldn't really find that but here play a game

315
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,500
you can address those cards and letters to loki at orange lounge radio dot com

316
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,820
send flowers he loves them

317
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,180
all right I dark soccer is not here tonight as we mentioned earlier in the

318
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,420
program she's feeling sick she has asian bird flu

319
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,420
No, I'm teasing. She doesn't have Asian bird flu, but she's sick, and we hope she feels better soon.

320
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,420
She's usually in charge of the mailbox, and this would be the part where we would go to the mailbag.

321
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:06,420
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com. However, I haven't dug through the mailbag this week, so I have no idea what's in there.

322
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,420
However, I have looked at the MySpace, and we got some questions on MySpace.

323
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,420
People who didn't realize they can send it over to Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

324
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,420
So I'm going to go ahead and read a question that we got on MySpace.

325
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,260
And this question comes to us from Joey. Hi, Joey

326
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,980
Joey says hey

327
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,980
I just got through part B of this week's podcast

328
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:30,460
Meaning last week 179 the part where you guys talked about the Genesis got me to my closet and I pulled out my Genesis 3

329
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:37,100
The slim line of the Genesis if you will then I realized the only game I could find was my Street Fighter 2 special

330
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,820
champions edition and Mortal Kombat

331
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:44,500
I was hoping to restart my collection and hoping you could help me out by giving me a short list of good games to look

332
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,660
for. Now I know all about the Sonics and Toejam and Earls, so maybe if you guys knew some

333
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,000
non-mainstream games, that would be awesome. Also, do you remember the name of that new

334
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,960
Genesis game being released? I'm not sure if I heard about it from you guys, but this

335
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,980
is the only show I can think of that would have cool news like that. Sorry about the

336
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,640
length of this, by the way. Not a problem, Joey. Appreciate the MySpace message. Joey,

337
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,840
the name of the game you're trying to think about on the Genesis is called Beggar Prince.

338
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,600
That was the new game that's being released.

339
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,360
We did bring that up a few weeks ago on this show, and actually, if you want to visit one

340
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:24,520
of our buddies over on allgames.com, Bobby Blackwolf, visit his site at allgames.com

341
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:31,080
slash podcast, and actually I think he's also at bobbyblackwolfshow.com now.

342
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,700
He had an interview with the people that made Baker Prince, it was a really long interview,

343
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,720
so if you want to hear all about Genesis development in this day and age, look back in his archives

344
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,280
about six weeks or so, and he had an interview a while back, so check that out.

345
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,820
As far as non-standard Genesis games, well you didn't mention Phantasy Star, my friend,

346
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,280
so if you're into RPGs, you don't want to miss the Phantasy Star series.

347
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,800
It's a shame Jamie's not here, because she loves the obscure Genesis titles.

348
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,280
Can you think of anything, Spike?

349
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,740
Could we start with obscure and work our way down, because we could go for a good hour

350
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,740
here.

351
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,740
Okay, try me.

352
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,080
Name some titles that this kid needs on his Genesis.

353
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:12,340
I would strongly recommend, let's see, Decap Attack, and the funny thing is, if you've

354
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,900
never played it, I mean, it's a fairly cartoony game.

355
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,940
I mean, yeah, you're a mummy zombie guy throwing your head at people, but it's done in a comical

356
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,740
style of, like, Rise Star, which I would also recommend.

357
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,780
Rise Star, Gunstar Heroes...

358
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,460
What was that one that was, uh, it was, like, in a comic book?

359
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,460
The whole book?

360
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,460
Comic Zone?

361
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,460
Comic Zone.

362
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,860
Excellent addition to that list, by the way.

363
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,020
Oh yeah, I highly recommend it.

364
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,780
I mean, if we're going even with, you know, kind of the standard games, don't let yourself

365
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,540
forget the Echo games.

366
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,180
Don't let yourself forget Eternal Champions if you like substandard 2D graphics in a kind

367
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,840
of subpar fighting game that's so cheesy you can't help but laugh.

368
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,300
Comments from our chat room here, some suggestions from the chat room.

369
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,740
Legend of Zaku suggests After Burner 2, Rama suggests Kid Chameleon, DJ Pooh Eater suggests

370
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:12,580
Alex Kidd, Legend of Zaku also suggests Vectorman as well, lots of interesting suggestions there,

371
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,900
oh you didn't like the Vectorman suggestion did you?

372
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,960
They didn't say Vectorman 2 so they get a point there.

373
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:26,300
Anything else real quickly you want to recommend?

374
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Wonderboy and Monsterworld.

375
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,800
There you go.

376
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Wonderboy and Monsterworld.

377
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
My best Genesis.

378
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,340
And Jamie would say Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.

379
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,340
I don't know.

380
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,340
Can you even get that in this country?

381
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,340
I don't even know.

382
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,340
All right.

383
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,340
There's some suggestions for you.

384
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,540
Also a couple of quick, quick emails.

385
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,180
My sister sent me an email because I think she's listening to the program or something,

386
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,180
but my sister sent me an email, Dana, and she says, Can you tell me what's wrong when

387
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,180
I try to DDR?

388
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,180
My foot won't work.

389
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,420
I try to dance, but when I go fast, my foot quits working.

390
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,920
But I really like your Japanese pop.

391
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,880
My sister writes her emails like a seven-year-old, might I share.

392
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,420
If you're playing too much DDR and your foot stops working, stop playing DDR for a couple

393
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,740
days and then go back.

394
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,780
You should never push yourself too much on DDR.

395
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:14,500
If you're feeling stamina, soreness issues, any of that stuff, seriously take a break.

396
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:20,520
One other quick email, this came to us from Justin M. This came to my email box, not the

397
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
normal mailbag.

398
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,960
know if you've heard yet but they're making a movie of DOA. It looks awesome. It comes

399
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,640
out this August. Awesome or awful? Sorry, gotta disagree with you there. Yes, we know

400
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,080
the Dead or Alive movie is coming, but as to the fact that it looks awesome, I suppose

401
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:42,440
if you're into tits and ass it'll be great. Or Charlie's Angels. Yeah, the first Charlie's

402
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,040
Angels was good. The second Charlie's Angels was... was. It just was. Second Charlie's

403
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,120
Angels. It just was. If you believe that, I'd like to sell you this Alone in the Dark

404
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,820
DVD I have stop be nice

405
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Be nice to the people who email me all right if you have an email you want to send us send it over to mailbag

406
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,160
At orange lounge radio.com dark soccer will be back next week to read those emails and yes

407
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,780
We will be doing a show next week on Easter Sunday

408
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,760
Because we have nothing better to do because our families don't love us and didn't invite us over

409
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,940
No, I'm teasing we minded

410
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,360
I know I minded to but I don't know about your house, but Easter dinner at my house is like two o'clock

411
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,660
So it leaves me leaves me plenty of time to do this program. We'll see. All right

412
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,760
Loki

413
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,120
Yes

414
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,140
Canceled games. What's up? Yes, unfortunately if you're you know

415
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
really looking forward to

416
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Spending the night on the internet with people and having virtual sex

417
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,980
Think again spend the night the MMO that was going to be put out and basically the sex MMO

418
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,420
So, um, cancelled.

419
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:55,620
Difficulty raising funds, I guess is the reason for that.

420
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:01,100
And so it's on hold indefinitely until they can make the money to, you know, pay the virtual

421
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,420
prostitutes that are going to be in the game.

422
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,420
I don't know.

423
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,980
Imagine that the sex game couldn't get funding.

424
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,980
And there was much rejoicing.

425
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,340
Oh, no, no.

426
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,460
I disagree.

427
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,700
Because you know what?

428
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:18,980
Why is it that we have a bazillion violent games, yet when we look at sex-related games,

429
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,500
we have the guy game?

430
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Playboy Mansion.

431
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
You know?

432
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,300
What a bunch of crap.

433
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:33,340
You know, I would like to see a sexual game that's not super crappy.

434
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,820
And you think this was that game?

435
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:41,580
Okay, maybe not, but, you know, I just, I don't, I don't know.

436
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,660
I don't think we should be frowning on it just because it's a sex game.

437
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,580
I mean, there's plenty of violent games out there that are okay.

438
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:54,200
Yeah, but you have to understand, murder okay, sex not okay.

439
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,720
Sex gets companies sued.

440
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,620
How do you make the people to murder sex, right?

441
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,300
Where's the logic here?

442
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,500
Shouldn't it be murder bad sex good?

443
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,940
All this hot coffee, sex game, what was Grand Theft Auto, murder game.

444
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,540
game okay sex game not okay

445
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,500
I agree with your point but I'm way more comfortable

446
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,820
leveling with the party of MMO players than I am

447
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,300
cybering with them with these 3D avatars

448
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,220
Dude, people do it anyway

449
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:35,220
your guild obviously in World of Warcraft is not as cool as mine okay

450
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,900
my guild is called World of Wank and they're a great time, no I'm kidding I'm totally

451
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,700
joking I hope you people don't think I'm serious

452
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,380
but don't you think people do this in MMOs as it is?

453
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:50,420
Come on. The Roleplay servers? What do you think that is? What do you think that's a

454
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,260
front for?

455
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,540
Roleplay? Hello. That's what Sims Online was.

456
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,540
That's exactly what Sims Online turned into, was one giant Vegas.

457
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:06,540
If you are a fan of music games...

458
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:21,700
Music Games, you may have already heard this, but Red Octane CEO Kelly Sumner revealed last

459
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,860
week that there are other products in development.

460
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,500
This guy used to be with Take-Two Interactive Europe, but now he's with Red Octane.

461
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,220
We can't tell you what the games are and when they're coming, but we kind of believe

462
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,180
It's probably not just the Guitar Hero sequels.

463
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,060
Perhaps this is a rival to Konami's Bomani brand?

464
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,060
Who knows?

465
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,860
Could be interesting.

466
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:50,140
I think it's interesting because I think Beatmania would have been a good game for them to compete

467
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,140
with.

468
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,140
Do you think they'd still do it?

469
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,820
You say rival, I say cheap knockoff.

470
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,820
So...

471
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,820
But...

472
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,820
Okay, wait a minute though.

473
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820
Was Guitar Hero...

474
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,700
Okay, maybe when you look at In the Groove DDR, I see your point there, despite the

475
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,260
fact that it's still controversial, but Guitar Hero versus Guitar Freaks, I don't think that

476
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:10,820
was a cheap knockoff. I don't. I think Guitar Hero was original enough and did a lot of...

477
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,980
Obviously most of the critics out there, 99% of them feel the same way I do.

478
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:20,580
Yeah, because 99% of the critics out there, they don't know the history of the music game

479
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,460
series out there, and they also don't do the research. So...

480
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,700
Just do them all! Just do them all!

481
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,460
You don't think Guitar Hero innovated on the Guitar Freaks concept at all?

482
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:37,820
Innovative by basically adding more buttons made it a little bit more difficult and by

483
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,920
adding a whammy bar which didn't really do much you know what I stopped playing that

484
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,800
game after a few times and I just got bored with it it's a cool it's a cool game because

485
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:55,000
it's new to us the US and stuff but to be honest when these next few games come out

486
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,820
or the next sequel or whatever it's just gonna be like a whole guitar freaks thing you mean

487
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,040
Granted, I'm not saying Guitar Freaks is innovative because it's been the same damn game since

488
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
Fifth Mix.

489
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,500
They've been cookie-cuttering the whole thing along the way, but still, Spike, you have

490
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,700
Adam first and I'll go.

491
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,580
Now I definitely prefer Guitar Freaks to Guitar Hero.

492
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:20,180
I do not like Guitar Hero, but as a musician, I will say that playing Guitar Hero is way

493
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,940
closer to playing an actual instrument.

494
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,280
And I think that in that way, it's actually a superior game.

495
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Even if I don't prefer it myself, I think that on a technical level, it's a much more

496
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,280
impressive work.

497
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,240
Okay, here's my deal, and I'm taking the music out of this equation.

498
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,520
I'm not even considering the music in Guitar Freaks and music in Guitar Hero, because that's

499
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,640
a matter of opinion.

500
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,880
Okay, so just putting the game engine side by side.

501
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,240
Guitar Hero has way more of the fun factor in it.

502
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,800
Guitar Freaks, turn it on, pick your song, go.

503
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,040
Turn it on, pick your song, go.

504
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,480
Guitar Hero has that whole, like, oh, you're in a band and you have the shops where you

505
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,820
can upgrade your guitars and unlock the songs and you do the whammy and there's

506
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,700
a crowd there and they're yelling for you

507
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,900
whereas guitar freaks is here look at this choppy animation while you play

508
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,060
your song

509
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,220
there's a lot to be said there that makes it more of a party game okay so

510
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,340
you upgrade your guitar which does what

511
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,660
oh it changes the appearance of your guitar in the game whoop-a-dee-doo

512
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:17,540
that's but there's a crowd what does guitar freaks have nothing

513
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,420
it doesn't have any of that

514
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,000
it has the fact that it was first

515
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,300
have that

516
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,540
don't call it an original game call it an improvement of another game. How about that?

517
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,780
I will give you that because it does when I play Guitar Hero it really does

518
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,780
feel to me like I am playing

519
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:40,760
Guitar Freaks mixed with Amplitude. Exactly. But with, I don't know, with

520
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,240
more of the fun factor for me. I just hate being able to call it this way. There's a reason why it's so

521
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,700
accessible to people.

522
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,260
I don't mind it being a good game. I hate the fact that people are calling it

523
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,860
innovative because it's not you know granted it may be more realistic to you

524
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,580
know playing a guitar doesn't make it innovative makes it better

525
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,020
okay and also the fact that people are you know

526
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,340
kind of basically posing this as an original game it's not original game it

527
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,140
fucking rips off three different games

528
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,820
what's the best things of them together granted that's a good idea it's you

529
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,780
basically improving on those concepts but it's not an original game

530
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,500
you know I'm just

531
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,360
I hate people calling original and innovative

532
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,360
Katamari Damacy, that was original.

533
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,800
This is not original.

534
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,200
All right, comments from our chat room.

535
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,080
GS191 says, the only reason people like Guitar Hero is

536
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,880
because of the music.

537
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,080
The majority of America does not like the whole techno

538
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,120
J-pop theme.

539
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,880
Interesting point there.

540
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,200
We also have, let's say, Fireboma says, if you showed

541
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,480
critics Guitar Freaks, they'd say it was a rip-off of

542
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,280
Guitar Hero at this point in time.

543
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,880
And I'd agree with you, but that's just a lot of critics.

544
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,800
They're ignorant.

545
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,000
They're ignorant.

546
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,720
Because you watch, if they decide to release, you know, guitar freaks over here, they'll

547
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,080
be like, why are they ripping off Guitar Hero?

548
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
What the hell?

549
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,720
This is a crappy Guitar Hero knock-off.

550
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,080
Seriously, I'm going to fucking beat those people to death is what's going to happen.

551
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:10,680
I don't know if Spike's laughing at the same thing I am, but Dark Tetsuya wrote in the

552
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,480
chat room, ignorant, but he capitalized the first three letters of that word, and I'll

553
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,280
And I'll just let you kind of dream up what he's trying to say there.

554
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,760
I'll leave it to you.

555
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,440
And then of course our chat room is just going off with what the mystery game could be.

556
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:32,080
DJ Pooh Eater suggests Banjo Freaks, Firebooma suggests Clarinet Hero, DJ Pooh Eater, Flute

557
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,380
Hero, Hitstun, Xylophone Hero, Drum Hero says Dark Knight, which I think a lot of us are

558
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,080
thinking might be it.

559
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
You know, why not?

560
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,600
If they're going to rip off Guitar Freaks, why don't they rip off Drummania while they're

561
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
at it?

562
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:51,260
I mean seriously, I would not be surprised if that's the big surprise game at E3 is Drum

563
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,200
Hero or whatever they call it.

564
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,480
Spiritsnarrow would like to point out, people in reviews have actually nodded to Guitar

565
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,960
Freaks at least once.

566
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,880
Depends what site you're reading it from, but you are right, I have seen those reviews

567
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,200
that have been good enough to do that.

568
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:12,480
on to a new topic. Loki, I thought this game was already out, but there's a new game coming

569
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,280
to the Playstation 2 and PSP? Yeah, the Fast and the Furious. Like I said, I thought this

570
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,960
game was already out. It was called Need for Speed Most Wanted Underground. It was also

571
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:26,960
called Midnight Club 3 Dub Edition. That's right, yeah. Or Juice Precision Street Racing.

572
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,200
No, but they're actually... Please, nobody played that. Hey, they're making a PSP port

573
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,360
of it or whatever. Apparently somebody did. But no, actually they are making a licensed

574
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:45,360
game based on the upcoming movie. Fast and Furious 3 Tokyo Drift. LAME! Wait, for real?

575
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,460
There's a Fast and the Furious 3 Tokyo Drift coming out? Yes, seriously. Isn't that just

576
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,600
initial D the movie? The funny thing is, it doesn't even have Paul Walker. It has a guy

577
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,760
who looks like Paul Walker. I thought Paul Walker was in that. No, Paul Walker is in

578
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
the movie.

579
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,880
No, Paul Walker is in that movie because Paul Walker has no work other than that.

580
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,640
Is it Paul Walker goes to Tokyo?

581
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Is that the plot?

582
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
It's stupid.

583
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,640
It's just being...

584
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
Paul Walker versus the Asian mafia?

585
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,680
It's basically, ooh, the Asian chick who's hot.

586
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,200
Let's bring her back and let's bring Paul Walker back because we need somebody from

587
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
the original series.

588
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,200
Maybe they'll have sex.

589
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,600
And yeah, maybe they'll have sex and she'll get all hot and schoolgirl-like and uh...

590
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,760
Paul Walker is not listed on Internet Movie Database.

591
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,200
Well, too bad.

592
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,880
No one's gonna miss him, so...

593
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,440
You know, does this movie have Vin Diesel in it?

594
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,500
Okay, Rama in our chat room would like to point this out, and I'm almost positive he's

595
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
right here.

596
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,600
Fast and the Furious was already in the arcade, and it was based on the LA Rush engine.

597
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,520
I'm sure it was, but anyways, this game is gonna be coming out.

598
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,560
What's unique about it, well, I'm not sure if it's unique, but it's kinda cool, is they're

599
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:55,900
gonna have 500 body kits from authentic manufacturers, so you're actually gonna have real upgrade

600
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:02,600
part and you know it's also going to feature boss races as well as advanced rubber band

601
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,100
artificial intelligence systems.

602
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,220
I fucking hate god damn advanced rubber band artificial intelligence systems.

603
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,840
You're racing, you're kicking the AI's ass and all of a sudden, they're going 500 fucking

604
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,320
miles to catch up to you.

605
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,320
I don't think so.

606
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,800
If you're fucking out racing them.

607
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,220
I love it in Initial D because I'm always behind in the race, like I'll be racing a

608
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,760
friend I'm always behind and then it totally favors you on the last lap and then right

609
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,580
at the finish line. I get ahead of them and they're like, MOTHERFUCKER! No seriously,

610
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:34,720
like when I'm playing Burnout or something like that, I will have destroyed the car I'm

611
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,020
racing as. You know, racing against one car. You know, destroyed him like, and I've already

612
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:43,520
almost slapped the guy, and all of a sudden he's going like Mach 7 down this goddamn freeway.

613
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,700
They catch up to me. So, I hate that shit. But anyways, so um, this game's coming out.

614
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:56,680
2 PSP only yeah check it out if it looks good I don't know to be honest it's just

615
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,040
gonna be another racing game and there are midnight club 3 double-dition remix

616
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,100
just came out what a few weeks ago it's like 1999 by that instead I mean

617
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:13,700
seriously don't encourage them to make more movies I didn't say by no no I

618
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,380
that's what I'm saying I'm saying I'm saying to the youth of America do not

619
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,860
encourage these people to make Fast and the Furious 4.

620
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,700
Seriously, who the hell is in this?

621
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,920
The Asian chick now is in this, okay?

622
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,220
Was Vin Diesel in this?

623
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,220
No.

624
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,220
Was Paul Walker in this?

625
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,220
No.

626
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,220
That's sad.

627
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,020
Ranma in our chat room is saying, hey, the Fast and the Furious 3 will own for one reason.

628
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,140
Keiko Kirikawa, who is Sailor Mars.

629
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:43,020
Yeah, the Asian chick, as I'm dubbing her.

630
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:49,020
By the way, she's lending her likeness to other really fun movies like the Dead or Alive

631
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,620
movie, which sucks balls, by the way.

632
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,800
You haven't seen it.

633
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,020
I've seen the trailer, and it sucks balls.

634
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,980
You can't judge a movie based off the trailer.

635
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:04,540
Dude, the trailer is fucking, you know, let's rip off Charlie's Angels 2.

636
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,100
I'm trying to think of a movie that had a great trailer that sucked balls.

637
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,820
Because if that's true, the reverse would be true.

638
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:15,940
movie with a great trailer that sucked balls? I want to say Fantastic Four but I

639
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,900
haven't seen it so I can't really dog on it but most people have told me it's bad.

640
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,660
So transporter one and two. Okay there you go. Good call. Good call. So

641
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,980
transporter one and two. How about Freddy vs. Jason maybe? Like you know you see the

642
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,900
trailer and you go that's a fucking great concept. You go and see the movie

643
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,460
and you're like what the fuck did I just waste $10 on? No I'm just teasing it

644
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,760
wasn't that bad I can't really I can't really rag on it but yeah I mean

645
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,840
you get my point. Well Freddy vs. Jason was supposed to be cheesy

646
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,880
that's the whole point. And it'll be just like Freddy vs.

647
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,280
Jason vs. Ash if they ever do that, which I wish they would.

648
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,360
You know, completely off topic here, has anyone actually seen, you know, Triple X

649
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:01,920
2 or whatever? No, why would I do that? It's great though, I haven't seen Triple X 1.

650
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,240
They have this hilarious thing though, it's this bonus thing where they're talking about what

651
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,280
happened to the original

652
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,720
triple X character Vin Diesel's character in the way they've done it

653
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,580
they've shot every shot you see a triple X is just the back of him so because

654
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:19,480
it's not Vin Diesel but they like they kill him off like really bad that was

655
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,840
that episode of South Park where they spliced all of Isaac Hayes lines

656
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:29,880
together to get Shaq you know hello children would you like to make love

657
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,880
and that whole thing yeah all right a new story please thank you

658
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,440
Namco has new Namco Bandai I should say has new plug-and-play controllers

659
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,200
they're going to be releasing it's called let's TV play classic yeah these

660
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,920
controllers will plug directly into your TV and have four playable games two old

661
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:55,560
ones two new ones Namco nostalgia has the retro dragon buster and new dragon

662
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:01,440
Buster 100 retail price is just under $30 US so what I'm curious are they

663
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,560
gonna have some of those other Namco things they've upgraded I see Mappy and

664
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,320
it looks like Xevious on the one of these box arts there so it might be some

665
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,520
kind of cool stuff by the way before you start thanking Namco for this kind of

666
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:17,880
stuff all of you know Namco is putting out the fast and the furious game so

667
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:26,840
reserve your hate well said Loki it's tax season right who missed the memo

668
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:34,680
apparently Capcom in Japan yeah either they forgot to fail to or they failed to

669
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,120
report approximately five point twelve billion yen that's about forty four

670
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:47,520
million dollars and in US and over six over the course of six years the penalty

671
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:54,480
is about 1.2 billion yen or 10 million dollars u.s. and so because of this

672
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,740
actually they delayed dead rising was one of the games that's being delayed

673
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:06,140
right now because of that and yeah it's kind of interesting oops slight

674
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,400
oversight there oh we have the file taxes that seems like a reasonable

675
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:18,960
mistake? Sure. We were just talking about Namco a minute ago and there's an

676
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,440
announcement kind of circulating this week. Old-school Namco games are soon

677
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,800
going to be available on Xbox Live Arcade because, you know, making that Namco

678
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,240
collection that they released on Xbox, making it backwards compatible just

679
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,320
wouldn't be good enough.

680
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,480
Let's milk some more money out of this franchise and let's put these games on

681
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,960
Xbox Live so people can hoard gamer points even more.

682
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,320
Pac-Man and Galaga are on their way to Xbox Live Arcade

683
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,860
complete with leaderboards and achievements. I can't possibly fathom

684
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,960
what achievements

685
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,760
will be available on Pac-Man.

686
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,440
You ate a ghost! Ding! 20 points! And yet you're gonna buy them aren't you?

687
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,160
Probably because I'm a sad, sad man. You know, hasn't Pac-Man been on like every

688
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,080
system

689
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,120
ever? Probably. Yeah. Probably. So this really isn't much of a surprise

690
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,840
honestly. Well just the fact that it's coming to Xbox Live Arcade I guess is a surprise.

691
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,080
but uh... notice how namco museum actually no i think i i think the

692
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,840
namco museum actually i might be wrong i think it is backwards compatible

693
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,880
i think that uh... fiftieth one i think i do remember seeing it on the backwards

694
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,640
compatibility list i think you can play it doesn't matter anyways if you had a

695
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,400
ridge racer you could play it anyways that's all i guess that's true

696
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,400
very good point

697
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
uh...

698
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,220
so but they want you to pay five dollars or maybe even ten who knows for leader

699
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,020
boards and what have you now here's an idea

700
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,240
how about eight port of the pac-man verses

701
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,900
like you had on the Game Boy Advance that you could hook into the GameCube

702
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,180
where you could play it on Xbox Live and some of your friends are the ghosts

703
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,180
and you're the Pac-Man. Now wouldn't that be a lot better? Wouldn't that make my money more worthwhile?

704
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,960
So how about this? Instead of just porting over the original Pac-Man, how about you port over one of the

705
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,580
Pac-Man remixes that they have, you know, where the graphics are at least a little bit better.

706
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,700
Where, you know, it might utilize the widescreen,

707
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,620
you know, like it did on the PSP. But no. No, we have to port over the original one and put some

708
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,860
art on the side there because yeah

709
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:12,500
it's great. Yeah. Rama in the chat room says fuck Pac-Man versus I want Pac-Mania

710
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,580
I want them both why don't we just get like a small Pac-Man anthology there

711
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:21,020
come on for five bucks for old games come on you can give me some

712
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,860
other old Pac-Mania you can give me Pac-Mania you can give me Pac-Man 91 or whatever it was

713
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,740
when they did the

714
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:32,500
the souped up versions give me some of that.

715
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,240
Loki oh, I wait at first I want to mention this

716
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:43,060
Gamer points. I was reading the Xbox forums this week and I saw some person say that they had rented top spin, too

717
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:49,240
And that they had figured out a way for them and their friend to play on Xbox Live and whore up the gamer points

718
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,680
By it because if you quit out of a match you still get credit for playing the match

719
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,740
So it was really easy to unlock the 25 and 50 matches gamer points

720
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:01,080
Is it ethical to do this to cheat your way to getting these gamer points?

721
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:09,080
How about renting games, getting the points, or basically renting games just for the sole purpose of milking out as many points as you can. Is that ethical?

722
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:17,080
Well, renting games, I wouldn't say it's not ethical. I would say that you just, you know, probably could be doing better things with your time and money.

723
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:27,080
But, you know, if you're playing the games to actually get the points correctly, then, you know, that's your prerogative if you want to go and rent these really crappy games to get the points out of them.

724
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:33,080
Um, as far as cheating to get points, I don't think it's right, but I do it, and, um...

725
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:41,080
Well, necessarily, I don't go as far as, you know, quitting games and stuff like that to cheat, but like, for example, Far Cry has cheat codes, and...

726
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:46,080
Ubisoft, they let you get achievement points with the cheat codes, and they have the same thing with Ghost Recon.

727
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:52,080
You know, it's their own damn fault that they didn't, you know, program it in there where you can't get the achievement with those.

728
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,760
Um, the outfit has cheat codes, but you don't get achievement points if you have them on,

729
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:02,240
so you know, the outfit sucks, by the way, but um, I don't know.

730
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:09,240
I think it's their own fault for that, so yeah, I guess it's wrong that they're cheating,

731
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,240
but I don't know.

732
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,080
I don't see a problem with them renting games.

733
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,200
I don't know.

734
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,080
I think I agree with your point where it's, I don't think it's renting the games to get

735
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,080
the points that's so bad.

736
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,600
I mean, I've borrowed games from you, and I've worked my way to getting achievement

737
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,860
points, but I would never cheat the system to do it.

738
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:32,340
Like that whole quitting in and out thing, that was just stupid.

739
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:37,420
If I notice that I'm going to get 10 points if I do this special little thing, it's like

740
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:42,260
in Geometry Wars, who's going to sit there for 60 seconds dodging all the monsters?

741
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,200
You wouldn't usually think to do that.

742
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,380
But hey, it was worth 10 points, I'll give it a try.

743
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:52,300
a little bit of a challenge, makes a little task. It's kind of like a mission. I sort

744
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,340
of think of it that way. And I don't think there's anything unethical about doing that.

745
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:59,380
Now, you can't really rent a game like Geometry Wars, but I think that theory applies. If

746
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,340
you're going to rent games and accomplish as much as you can, I think that's okay. But

747
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:07,800
I think when you resort to cheating and those things, I don't think that's okay. Specifically

748
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,540
for the purpose of getting gamer points. I mean, if you're cheating your way through

749
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:14,420
the game, then whatever, you've already made that decision. But I do think Xbox should

750
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:17,260
figure out a way to disable gamer points when you're cheating.

751
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,260
My point...

752
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,380
But if the developers left it in there, that's their own damn fault.

753
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,200
My point with Far Cry, for example, the game's hard enough even when you are cheating, so

754
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,080
you know what, it's just added fun for my...

755
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:32,220
They don't have an infinite health code, they just have infinite ammo, and infinite, like,

756
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:37,940
feral or your adrenaline or whatever, and it's still really fun, it's still really hard,

757
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,980
and it just makes it, you know, so I don't have to go and try to, you know, collect ammo

758
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,980
and don't have to sneak my way through the game, because sneaking my way through the

759
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,540
game we caused that game to be about five times as long as it is now and it

760
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:51,420
is pretty long as it is so let's go to orange lounge radio.com click on chat and

761
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,540
look in our chat room for some comments on here Fireboma wants to know what

762
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:58,440
did the game what did the gamer points do nothing they're really they really

763
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,760
aren't anything it's it's an internet penis thing the more points you have the

764
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,180
bigger your internet penis is I mean even if you're a girl you know what I'm

765
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,260
talking about you're I'm talking about that whole you know look at me I'm cool

766
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:13,100
because I have you know 50 million gamer points you know and these are different

767
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:18,060
from the points that you use to actually buy things on the Xbox.

768
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,780
These are just totally useless status points.

769
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,080
It's a status symbol.

770
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:27,640
It's like, remember on the Atari 2600, if you could get like 2000 points and kaboom,

771
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,380
you take a picture, remember don't use the flash and you send it to Activision, they'll

772
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,920
send you a patch that you can put on your jacket.

773
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,920
I think that's pretty cool.

774
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,920
That's what this is.

775
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,680
I think it's cool too, but I don't think it's cool and people cheat to do it.

776
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,400
You know what, if they did that for the Xbox Live arcade games, the patches, I wonder if

777
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,800
that would actually be kind of like a cult thing, you know, if people would pick up on

778
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,800
that.

779
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,680
Because, you know, people are into this retro shit, so I think that would be kind of neat.

780
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,440
And you'd see probably a whole, I think it'd bring more attention to it, so, I don't know.

781
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,880
DJ Poo Eater would like to know, is it virtual boobs for the girl gamers?

782
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:07,440
No, Roz in the chat room says, my E penis, hers is 12 miles long on a cold day.

783
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,960
That's quite the impressive e-penis there.

784
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,680
Also what was the other comment in here I saw?

785
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:18,760
Oh, GS191 said, great, point whoring, what's next, the achievement point police?

786
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,940
Head on over to the Xbox Live forums, there are some people on there that have their panties

787
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,680
in a bunch that people are cheating their way to getting these points.

788
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:35,200
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line very, very soon over at our website www.orangelaunchradio.com.

789
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,060
on interact with us and you can call us on the skype line to talk about anything that

790
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:43,700
you want to hear this last few minutes of the show open forum but first a couple quick

791
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:49,220
notes first off the other contest we promised we were going to do tonight we are also doing

792
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:54,280
a giveaway tonight for amped three this is the action-packed snowboarding game for the

793
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,700
xbox 360 now loki you actually own this game right i have to i have to be honest i haven't

794
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,800
played this yet but loki you own this i owned it sold it bought it back because i liked

795
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,080
it. What do you do in this game? It's snowboarding? It's snowboarding. The only thing that turned

796
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,000
me off about it is because it didn't have live support, because it would have been pretty

797
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,460
sweet live. But it's your snowboarding game type thing. What's kind of cool about it is

798
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:20,300
they have hang gliding in there as well, snowmobiles, sleds, which are pretty cool, and the sleds

799
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:27,140
are fun. It's just a really weird game. The cut scenes are done with weird comics, sock

800
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:31,260
puppets. Yeah, I see a little pink bunny on the back of the box there. That has my interest

801
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,060
It's really acid trippy, it reminds me of like MTV2 or something like that.

802
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,060
But um...

803
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,500
Like Wondershosen or something?

804
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,820
Very yeah, very Wondershosen-ish.

805
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:45,560
It's a fun game and you know, if you get a chance to go get a game, because there isn't

806
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,900
really too much coming out in these next few months, check it out, they've actually dropped

807
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:53,900
the price down to $39.99 now, and so it's really cheap, you can go find it and it's

808
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:57,460
a good snowboarding game until there's another SSX or something.

809
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,120
if you're feeling like a cheap bastard you can win one right now just send an

810
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,760

plus we'll pick one at random next week achievement point hoard there are some

816
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:19,060
pretty easy achievement points in there and it's got a terrain editor which is

817
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,760
kind of neat over three hundred new audio tracks

818
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,860
that's a lot of that's a lot of music i haven't heard all the audio tracks it's

819
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,860
It's a lot to listen to. It's a lot of independent rock.

820
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,860
Hey, that's fine.

821
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,860
I'm a supporter of Indie Rock. I think that's a good thing.

822
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,860
But it's worth checking out.

823
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,860
Just send an email to snow at orangeontrader dot com.

824
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:40,860
And not snowboard, we have to think of a word that you actually have to be listening to the show to hear.

825
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,860
So snow at orangeontrader dot com if you want to win a copy of AMP 3.

826
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,860
The Xbox 360, so you have to be a 360 owner.

827
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,860
The game won't do you much good otherwise, I'm sorry to say.

828
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,860
But hey, if you don't have a 360, I was actually at Fry's today and they had some there.

829
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,980
oh they're making they're making their way around now you can get you can get a

830
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,180
360 now yeah so just to clarify some folks in our chat room are saying is

831
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:07,300
this for ps2 no this is Xbox 360 amp 3 you might is amp 2 and amp 1 those are

832
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:11,220
and those are Xbox I think just regular I don't think you get those on ps2 it's

833
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,940
made by 2k games who also made topspin 2 which I talked about earlier in the show

834
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,860
all right we can't wait to give stuff away next week we'll be pulling for not

835
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:23,580
just that but the 24 game we gave away in part a and if you missed it listen to

836
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:27,180
Part A, because we'll tell you how to win the 24 game.

837
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,020
Loki,

838
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,600
Laura Croft.

839
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,800
I bashed the Tomb Raider demo earlier in the show, but at least there's some good

840
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,820
news coming

841
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,280
Laura Croft's way.

842
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,440
Yes, Laura Croft,

843
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,800
don't ask me why, I really don't know why,

844
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,680
she was actually, she's earned a Guinness World Record as the most successful

845
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,160
video game heroine.

846
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,680
To which I ask,

847
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:57,680
what about Mrs. Pac-Man? Seriously. But apparently, what kind of a fucking record is that anyways?

848
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,520
That's not a record. She didn't eat the most chili dogs in the world. She didn't, you know,

849
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:09,520
grow the longest, you know, whatever, carrot. I mean, she's just a fake person in a game.

850
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:16,200
And so, okay, over the past 10 years, Lovecraft has sold, they've sold over 28 million games

851
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:23,240
worldwide in the Tomb Raider series. It's appeared on stage with U2 and covers over

852
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:30,320
200 magazines and more recently, of course, Angelina Jolie put out two really awful movies.

853
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:36,560
And yeah, and they have, you know, even over, it's a 1 billion dollar industry with items

854
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:43,140
from lunch boxes, soft drinks, motor vehicles receiving the Lara Croft brand treatment.

855
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:48,820
What kind of fucking vehicle has, you know, Tomb Raider edition or something like that?

856
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:53,100
I have not heard of that, but I don't know.

857
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,580
All that news in the world did not make that demo any better, I'm sorry to say.

858
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,580
And you know what?

859
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,020
You know what I have to ask though?

860
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,780
Is really, is Guinness Book losing like its edge?

861
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,960
I mean are they just letting anyone come into this book nowadays?

862
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:11,260
I mean even fake people, I mean I can understand if someone did a speed run through Tomb Raider

863
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,260
Could we get a world record for something?

864
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,900
How about most Guinness drank on a podcast?

865
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,260
We might be able to do that.

866
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,580
I'll join in for that one.

867
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,460
Heck yeah.

868
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,340
It's just like, really.

869
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,500
I mean, it's a fake person.

870
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,380
The fake person does not have a sex.

871
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,500
All right.

872
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,060
Let's go on over to the Skype line

873
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,300
over at orangelaungeradio.com, click on interact with us,

874
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,060
and see what our listeners have to say.

875
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,340
And we're already getting some calls.

876
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,460
Let's go to this first call.

877
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,420
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

878
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,060
Hey.

879
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,460
Hi, who's this?

880
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,300
This is Roz.

881
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,460
Hello, Roz.

882
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,100
What's on your mind?

883
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,900
Well, once again, I'm sitting around playing Advanced Crack

884
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,440
after being sick for all of last week, which

885
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,380
is why I didn't call.

886
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:57,740
Did you get Jamie sick?

887
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,940
Maybe.

888
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,700
All right.

889
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,540
Well, what did you call in to talk to us about tonight?

890
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:07,780
One of our stories you have some feedback to or anything?

891
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:11,460
Well, we could talk about my wonderful e-penis if you'd like.

892
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,900
It actually has a name and a holiday.

893
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,780
I was actually going to suggest, because I remember

894
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,460
you were mentioning about your large e-penis earlier,

895
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,300
is it appropriate for me to be saying

896
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,460
that girls who have a lot of achievement points on Xbox Live

897
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,140
or other types of online accomplishments have an e-penis?

898
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,060
Or is that sexist?

899
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:29,820
Absolutely.

900
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:30,980
All right, just making sure.

901
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,100
It's absolutely acceptable.

902
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,780
Mine has a name, actually.

903
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,680
Oh.

904
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,280
I call it General Grant.

905
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,140
General Grant?

906
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:41,220
Yes. Why do you call your E-Penis General Grant?

907
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:45,580
It all started one night.

908
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:50,380
I think it was actually March 29th,

909
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,700
which is our made-up holiday.

910
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:58,700
And I just came up with it. I just thought of the name.

911
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:03,380
Yeah. You know what? There's some guys out there that name their,

912
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,860
you know, I ain't talking about E, okay? They name their real deal.

913
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:09,980
and usually it's just because, now I don't sorry

914
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:14,300
but I usually it's just you know because they think of it one random night maybe

915
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,460
when they're high or something I don't know but

916
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:20,680
it comes it comes to them in a dream and suddenly

917
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,860
it has a name. I can understand that.

918
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:28,940
spiritsnarrow would like to point out in our chat room you named your E Penis

919
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,320
you win the podcast

920
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,900
congratulations and Jism would like to know, or Jism

921
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,900
I hope it's not Gizm that might be bad. Gizm says.

922
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,900
Sorry buddy, sorry, sorry.

923
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,900
What am I listening to? Ha ha ha.

924
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,900
You won the show and I just lost it.

925
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,900
Thank you.

926
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:57,900
Roz, anything else on your mind?

927
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:01,900
Advanced Wars. Holy shit, it's so fun.

928
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:07,100
put it down and maybe try some Kingdom Hearts 2? No? Maybe I'll stop for a while and play

929
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:11,780
more Phoenix Wright, but I don't think I'll move from those two. Alright, well Phoenix

930
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:18,780
Wright is a good game too. The thing with Kingdom Hearts is that my PS2 is dead. Like,

931
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:25,260
really dead. In a couple short months the PS3 will be out and then the PS2 is bound

932
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:31,180
to get a price cut. Yeah, that's probably a good thing for me because my PS2 is dead

933
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,580
and I miss playing Akaji.

934
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:36,280
Roz, you should beg and plead maybe our chatters.

935
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,080
Maybe they'll take up a collection for a new PS2 for you.

936
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,880
Offer to show them General Grant.

937
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,880
Please, General Grant wants a PS2.

938
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,980
Alright. Roz, I gotta let you go so we can get to another call,

939
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,880
but thank you so much for calling in, okay?

940
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,380
Okay, bye.

941
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,280
Have a good one. Bye-bye.

942
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,080
Alright, let's go to another call.

943
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,280
We're getting hammered tonight, guys.

944
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,280
I'm not gonna be able to get to everybody.

945
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,280
I'm so sorry.

946
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,580
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

947
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:58,180
Who's this?

948
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,780
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

949
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:05,120
slam that door. Who's this? Hi, this is Spirit Snare.

950
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:09,720
Hi Spirit Snare, what's on your mind? Why did you have to shut the door there?

951
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,120
Were you afraid somebody was going to hear me?

952
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,040
That was my brother actually.

953
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,080
Tell them to stop being a brat. What's on your mind?

954
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,120
About Guitar Hero being innovative.

955
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,760
I was actually surprised that you didn't...

956
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,760
you guys didn't like... you guys weren't

957
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,560
outraged like whatchamacallit

958
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:37,280
back when it was announced over at the

959
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:42,000
game developers conference at ETH when guitar hero was first announced at

960
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:42,680
E3

961
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,880
when guitar hero was announced as being the most innovative at the

962
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,680
GDC

963
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,280
oh yeah what do you think about that Loki you remember how guitar hero won the

964
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,340
prize of most innovative among many

965
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:57,640
other awards guitar heroes won this year he's making a

966
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,720
Jerk off motion with his hand there. That's that's lovely. It's retarded. Let me put that I

967
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:07,760
You know what low-key? I think you're in the minority. I think a lot of people think but I will say this though. I think

968
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,260
amplitude

969
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:15,580
Frequency should have been given more of those types of honors. I mean this is kind of like okay

970
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:22,000
You know how the Grammys have a best new artist category every year and sometimes the person who wins the best new artist

971
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:27,500
This is actually like their fifth album, but it's like they're just now getting noticed right you know what I mean

972
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,820
yeah that's kind of what this reminds me of is it's like okay it's not really a

973
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:37,100
new concept but they did it so well this time we're gonna notice them that's

974
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:43,460
exactly what this is like to me so yeah but even though well even even though

975
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:51,500
guitar fix was like released like even though guitar fix was released like way

976
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:58,380
ahead of their time you know even though like it's a con it's a mixed up concept

977
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:05,740
and stuff that really shouldn't have deserved the award well I guess

978
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:09,260
everybody is open to their own opinion anything else you want to share with us

979
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:13,940

I have 900.

987
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,360
I have more than you, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

988
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,440
Oh, that's just great.

989
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,080
Is that the only reason you're upset is because you have

990
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,960
a few points, whereas a lot of people have more?

991
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:06,040
No, I'm just way too poor to buy $60 games.

992
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,440
What about the cheapy little $5 and $10 games

993
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,200
you can get on Xbox Live?

994
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,000
Feeding Frenzy, 75 easy, easy points.

995
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,800
Crystal quest probably a hundred easy points right there

996
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:21,040
I'm saving my Microsoft points for Street Fighter. I want to kick someone's ass. There you go

997
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:26,000
You know Street Fighter is finally supposed to be coming out and I think April finally that will come out

998
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,080
But of course they've been saying this, you know for three months now, but if they're gonna fix the lag, I guess it's a good thing

999
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,840
Yeah, that's what I'm excited for but

1000
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:40,840
Can I say one more thing?

1001
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,840
Of course.

1002
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,840
Can I say one more thing?

1003
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,840
Okay.

1004
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,520
There's a little bit of lag.

1005
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,240
The Mac boot camp thing?

1006
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,240
Mm-hmm.

1007
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,800
The Mac boot camp thing?

1008
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,440
I think it's the greatest thing that Mac ever did, supporting Windows.

1009
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,440
Yay.

1010
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,440
All right.

1011
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,440
Yay indeed.

1012
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,840
You can call me a hypocrite for nothing.

1013
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,840
All right.

1014
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,520
No, I won't call you a hypocrite.

1015
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,520
I think it's a smart move for Mac as well

1016
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,640
All right have a good box guy have a good one Ravens dolphin

1017
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,560
See ya

1018
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,000
We're getting a little bit of lag there with Ravens dolphin. Maybe we'll do one more call

1019
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,720
I do want to say real fast though. Um, somebody said in chat room. Let's see

1020
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,080
Where is it? Oh, it really is pronounced jism. That's how you say that name. It's short for

1021
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:30,960
Neologism so it's actually pronounced jism. So I said the name right the first time I know I do not have something dirty on the brain

1022
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,360
You you freaking perverts. I don't even have faith. I don't even know what you're talking about

1023
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,680
I don't even know what you're talking about. That's how pure my soul is

1024
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,600
Okay, we're gonna pick up one more call

1025
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,800
I'm doing this completely at random because everybody in chat is yelling me to pick up their call

1026
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,480
But I'm just gonna pick up a random call. Hello. You're on orange on radio. Hi. Hi. Who's this?

1037
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:45,480
you spoil it I'll fly out to new Connecticut and choke you how is the

1038
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,640
ending it's it's good it's kind of similar to the first one though mm-hmm

1039
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:53,880
Um in the sense that it ends with the king sending him a letter I

1040
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,960
Said don't ruin the damn thing

1041
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,640
Right, that's not spoiler. All right, fine

1042
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:07,640
But yeah, it's it's good. Um, the last boss battle is very good. It kind of had a wind waker like vibe to it in a

1043
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,640
way

1044
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:14,520
Um, you know the way you killed off Ganondorf in the end. They had it kind of had a similar like really flashy

1045
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,520
Oh, you spoiled Wind Waker for me!

1046
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,520
Shut up!

1047
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,520
Alright, was it worth the $50 you paid for it?

1048
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:31,520
Honestly, I don't think video games at all are worth $50, but I certainly had a great time with it.

1049
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,520
It was only like 30 hours, but it was a good 30 hours.

1050
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:40,520
There were a few bosses I didn't like because they were really annoying.

1051
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,520
Did you spend 3 hours on the prologue?

1052
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,660
yes so that means 10 percent of the game is the prologue

1053
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:50,680
yep that's amazing spike you had a question okay so

1054
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:54,660
my question for you is did you get the hidden video at the end

1055
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:58,960
no but I saw it before it even came out

1056
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,040
on the internet I heard it it's

1057
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,360
I can't even say I don't want to spoil but I heard it's

1058
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,600
it's what the hidden video in part one did for part two

1059
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,200
are you banning me from asking my question on the air?

1060
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:17,240
You cannot spoil the game or many people will kill you.

1061
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,240
Send Spike an email.

1062
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,640
You guys, you kids can Kingdom Hearts it out an email, okay?

1063
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,840
If you want to see the secret ending, just go to YouTube.

1064
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,840
I know, yeah.

1065
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,160
I've seen it and I have some speculation about it, but...

1066
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,400
We can't spoil, though.

1067
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,400
We can't.

1068
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,440
It's like all over the GameFAQs message board.

1069
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,860
Can you make it spoiler-free somehow?

1070
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:38,320
I wouldn't be able to for what I want to say.

1071
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,320
Alright.

1072
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,320
Zander, Zander, we gotta let you go before something gets spoiled, okay?

1073
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:43,820
Okay.

1074
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:44,820
Have a good one.

1075
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:45,820
Ansem's still alive.

1076
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:46,320
Alright.

1077
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,820
I didn't even hear what he said, what did he say?

1078
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,820
He said Ansem's still alive.

1079
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:54,820
You dick.

1080
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,320
I lied, we'll do one more call.

1081
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:01,320
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1082
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:03,820
Hello.

1083
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:07,300
Hi, I lied. I lied. We decided to take one more call. What's on your mind?

1084
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:17,380
Well, oh yeah that I'm sick, I'm sorry to hear that what does that have to do with tonight's show

1085
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:22,780
No, I'm sure you get better soon. You know, obviously something's going around. Okay, seriously, what's on your mind?

1086
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:28,020
Okay, um, it's bothering me. You guys keep saying yen. It's pronounced N. I'm

1087
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,000
Say oh, oh the currency

1088
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,260
in Japan

1089
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:36,900
Mm-hmm. Well, you see I'm a honky who can't pronounce Japanese words, right?

1090
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:41,840
You know, I'll go you want to go out from some for some sushi. What do we get some sushi?

1091
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:47,940
And some teriyaki can I get some teriyaki chicken

1092
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:56,180
Yeah, all right, so I make mistakes it's you know what that's why I'm on the internet radio and not on real radio, okay

1093
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:01,100
Anything else you anything else you want to say besides picking on me

1094
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,100
Yes, this is Nintendo Maniac 64.

1095
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:07,100
Well, hi Nintendo Maniac 64!

1096
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:11,100
Or, as I say, Fever Maniac 64.

1097
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,100
Anything else on your mind tonight before I cut you off?

1098
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:19,100
Yeah, my DS charger cable. I've modded it so I have headphone jacks on the cord.

1099
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:28,100
I can plug in my AC adapter, a USB port, or, get this, a mouse port. Plug.

1100
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,100
I'm impressed.

1101
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,100
Resident Evil 4, bitch.

1102
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,100
Bye! Alright then.

1103
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,100
Get better soon.

1104
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,100
What is up with the colors tonight?

1105
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:45,100
Hey, I just wanted to talk, man.

1106
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,100
I'm sick, dude!

1107
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:52,100
Do you know what I fucking did with my mouse this week?

1108
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:57,100
I spent 30 hours on Kingdom Hearts this week!

1109
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,100
Now, my E-Penis is huge!

1110
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,100
I have a question for you.

1111
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,100
God, I love our fans.

1112
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,100
Yes, love you.

1113
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,100
Awesome.

1114
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:10,820
So, USB port and mouse port, what's the point?

1115
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,340
Because you can- Why do you install Linux on a toaster?

1116
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,340
Because you can.

1117
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,100
But you can't hook up a mouse to it.

1118
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,100
Huh?

1119
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:25,100
I mean, like, if I installed a cigarette lighter on my PSP, but I don't smoke.

1120
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,540
you would have it

1121
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:29,940
for what

1122
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:34,180
all right we're gonna go around and get tonight's last-minute stories any last

1123
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:36,860
minute things people want to bring up loki you seem to always have something

1124
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:40,500
uh... yeah i was gonna mention uh...

1125
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,700
there's a some rumors stuff i was reading

1126
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:46,540
one of them saying that final fantasy seven the remake is in production for

1127
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,220
the ps3 right now

1128
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:51,940
uh... that the trend also secured rights for grand theft auto the next grand theft auto

1129
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,620
for the 360 to be exclusive

1130
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:59,500
which is not going to happen and how God was the other one

1131
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,700
that's all I got so far

1132
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:06,780
alright I have a real last minute story here

1133
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:10,420
this is coming to us from GK 128 in the chat room there's a post over on

1134
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,580
Nintendo forums

1135
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:16,400
rumors going around that blue wave may perhaps be the real name of the

1136
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,360
revolution

1137
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:21,140
I take into consideration the revolution has a blue light

1138
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:25,180
there's waving the controller there's the blue ocean thing people been talking

1139
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:25,660
about

1140
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:30,780
a competition to blu-ray perhaps this leak is coming from some type of audio

1141
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,140
link there from your file host dot com

1142
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:36,220
I check that out in our chat room was just posted the link there I'm sure if

1143
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:39,020
this is true they'll be plenty of more news about in the next week

1144
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:42,900
right now take it as a rumor the name of the revolution to be the blue wave

1145
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:46,140
possibly I don't know your target sounding I'm sorry

1146
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:50,940
I I could see I could see it I could see that my problem is retarded

1147
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:54,900
is you're making it out to me. Spike? I really like the name Revolution.

1148
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:58,540
I do too. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I think that should be the name of it too.

1149
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:02,780
I mean, because it's revolutionary, it's...

1150
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:05,980
I don't know, you can revolve the controller around.

1151
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:09,020
I'm doing little quotation marks with my fingers here.

1152
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:12,300
It's catchy and buzzy.

1153
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:15,620
I think that it's exactly what Nintendo needs to turn their image around,

1154
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,900
something that's going to make people say, hey wait, this

1155
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:22,100
is different. Possibly. Any other last-minute stories?

1156
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:27,180
Spike, do you have something? Well, on Friday, actually, Capcom announced the Capcom

1157
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:29,260
Classics Collection Reloaded.

1158
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:32,860
It's the follow-up compilation disc for PlayStation 2 and

1159
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:37,080
Xbox. Right now the titles that have been announced for it are

1160
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:41,860
Eco Fighters, King of Dragons, Knights of the Round, also looks like some Commando,

1161
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:42,660
Ghosts and

1162
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:45,660
Ghosts and Ghosts, and Street Fighter 2.

1163
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:49,360
some of those games were in the last one

1164
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,940
that's kinda weird I don't I don't I don't get this press release but it's

1165
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,020
there on the internet

1166
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:57,340
Kotaku posted a link, IGN posted a link

1167
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:01,060
seems pretty kosher but

1168
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:04,740
Resident Evil 4 bitch

1169
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:08,260
any other last minute stories?

1170
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:11,460
just the one I have

1171
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:14,800
I also want to say really quick because somebody in the chat room reminded me to mention

1172
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,980
our panels at Fanime. Yes, we are going to be going to Fanime. We're doing panels that's

1173
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:23,280
still in the works. StarkSakura would know more about that. Just a reminder, that's Memorial

1174
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:28,200
Day weekend. Not only are we going to be there, but Spike, you're going to Fanime as well,

1175
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,520
correct? You're going to be there?

1176
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,540
Oh yeah, I'm there just about every year.

1177
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:34,360
And you'll be at our panels as well? Hopefully?

1178
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,360
Sure.

1179
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:39,080
Please? Yes. And, well, you'll at least be there. I don't know what we're doing for them

1180
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,080
yet.

1181
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,080
Yeah, I'll be present.

1182
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:44,180
He'll be there to sign autographs. And hopefully some of our other regulars. I know Extrafur

1183
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:49,620
will probably be there, and maybe we can get Miklataub to come with us too. We'll see.

1184
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:51,620
That'll all go down in front of me.

1185
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:53,360
Okay, I have one more thing.

1186
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,360
One more?

1187
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,180
Yeah, this is basically coming from the new issue of Game Informer. First off, they're

1188
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:03,060
sticking by their information that the new Halo game is going to be called Forerunner.

1189
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:10,300
They also revealed that a Project Orion is in existence, and basically it's supposed

1190
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:16,780
a team put together to explore the possibility of a Halo MMO, and it's still in the planning

1191
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:19,980
stages but it's going ahead.

1192
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:26,720
Also the Final Fantasy VII Remake for the PlayStation 3 is supposed to be going to have

1193
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:32,100
the Final Fantasy XII action battle system in there, so you're going to be in a real

1194
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:37,100
time battle with some armors until we see some actual details.

1195
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:41,700
Alright, that's about going to wrap it up for tonight's program, but not before we get

1196
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:45,460
to the last story of the evening, which comes to us from Loki.

1197
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:50,100
We were going to make Jamie talk about this, but maybe this is why she called in tonight,

1198
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,100
I don't know.

1199
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:54,940
Well, I wanted to first, real quick, before I go over the last story, I just want to mention

1200
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:56,420
what's coming out this week.

1201
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,580
Oh sure.

1202
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:04,660
If you are a PC Gamer fan, they have Auto Assault Online Limited Edition with some bonus

1203
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:05,660
stuff.

1204
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:11,820
finally coming out on the PC. Stacked, the poker game, is coming out which is interesting

1205
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:20,340
since the console version has been delayed until May. Let's see, nothing on the DS. Game

1206
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:25,340
Boy Advance only has crap coming out this week. GameCube though has Odama which is kind

1207
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:33,180
of strange. You know, feudal military strategy mixed with pinball. So that's an odd one.

1208
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:38,120
On PlayStation 2, you've got a new Monster Rancher game, Monster Rancher Evo, Samurai

1209
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:45,000
Champloo Side Trek, which is actually I think being developed by the people that did Killer7.

1210
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,760
Tomb Raider Legend is going to be available on all systems, including the 360 and the

1211
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,760
Xbox.

1212
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,360
I guess no GameCube until later this year.

1213
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:01,080
Of course on the PSP, we have the Silent Hill experience coming out that coincided with

1214
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,800
the movie released next week.

1215
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,180
It must have bumped that up.

1216
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,020
I believe they have.

1217
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:12,600
If I remember, Silent Hill, Silent Hill Experience, I thought that around that time was supposed

1218
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,800
to be not the Silent Hill Experience, but the collection.

1219
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,800
Hmm, interesting.

1220
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:20,140
But I haven't really heard anything official on that, so I don't know, maybe.

1221
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:24,740
So look for that if, you know, see if it's coming.

1222
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:28,700
Of course, yeah, I'm not too sure about these release dates, because it said Stacks is supposed

1223
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:31,720
to be coming out on the 11th and that's not right.

1224
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:37,520
But King of Fighters Neo Wave here, King of Fighters fan, and on the 360 MLB 2K6, only

1225
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,680
baseball game out there on the 360.

1226
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:44,520
Battlefield 2 is supposed to be pretty good, and Tomb Raider Legend on the fence.

1227
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:48,440
And I don't think DarkSakura would mind me stealing her European release dates, because

1228
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,260
she always talks about that for our friends in the UK.

1229
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:54,960
If you're over in the UK, you've got coming out this week on the 13th, Dragon Quest, Journey

1230
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,960
of the Cursed King.

1231
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:59,080
If you're an RPG fan, you must get this, PlayStation 2.

1232
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:04,140
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Double Team coming out on the DS, The Sims 2 expansion family

1233
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:08,920
fun stuff on the PC, Auto Assault also making its way to the PC, and SEGA is bringing out

1234
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:14,300
Football Manager 2006 on the Xbox 360 and the PSP, I believe that is the hard drive

1235
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,300
required title.

1236
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:16,300
Yes it is.

1237
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,300
For the 360 isn't it?

1238
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,300
Yes.

1239
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:22,320
Next week you guys have to look forward to Final Fantasy 11 on PC and Xbox 360, that

1240
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,400
would be the Treasures of Ot Organ of course.

1241
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:29,080
not yes that's right that is coming out next week for no no I'm sorry that is

1242

the following week yes it's the following week now I'm into the week at

1244
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,520

1245
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:45,320

1247
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:54,200
list says that's what i'm reading so take that with a grain of salt but uh...

1248
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:58,280
big grain of salt all right well that's what the list says that's just what i'm reading off of

1249
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,560
maybe you guys you know it's not uncommon for folks in the uk to once in a while get a game

1250
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:05,560
before us so i wouldn't i wouldn't uh... wait who's bringing that over because if that might

Okay, alright.

1262
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,600
Loki, last story of the night.

1263
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,640
Yes.

1264
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,040
Well, we've seen a lot of weird things come out.

1265
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,480
This I'm kind of...

1266
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,160
I don't think it actually ties in with the actual

1267
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,040
game, but

1268
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:08,040
if you're in Japan and you happen to be near a Japanese sex toy shop,

1269
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,640
you can find a Kingdom Heart

1270
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,800
vibrator.

1271
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,480
Yes, the Kingdom Hearts AC.

1272
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:31,360
It's selling a Kingdom Hearts branded rabbit vibrator. Of course, it doesn't look like it has anything to do with Kingdom Hearts, except for the name, maybe a brand name or something, but I don't know.

1273
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:36,400
It's something to get those Kingdom Hearts hardcore fans out there that they might not already own.

1274
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:41,960
Now you too can join organization 69.

1275
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,280
I want one. Put this on your little black hood.

1276
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:49,360
this is something to get those people that have the trans vibrator and can't

1277
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,760
think of you know anything else gaming-related to get. This reminds me of the Hello Kitty

1278
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:53,320
vibrator.

1279
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:57,800
I want to know how long it's gonna take for fan art with key blades with

1280
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,040
these dangling from the end on the chain.

1281
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:05,600
Really? And Dirty Thief just got the quote of the show there in our chat room.

1282
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,920
It's a key blade that unlocks your pleasure.

1283
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,960
They win at the internet.

1284
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:15,200
I think Dirty Thief ought to be marketing this show to the masses out there.

1285
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:19,400
Please, if you guys do want to market the show to the masses, we really appreciate it.

1286
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,880
That's the only way we get big is word of mouth.

1287
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:25,900
We don't have no big magazine company back in our show.

1288
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:29,000
We don't have no big website that backs our show.

1289
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
We are independent.

1290
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,760
We're as independent as it gets.

1291
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,640
We are out of the spare bedroom of my apartment doing this program and we need word of mouth.

1292
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,640
That's right.

1293
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,640
I'm wagging my face.

1294
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,800
The way your head is moving, I wish I could show the audience at home.

1295
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,800
Well, we're hoping to do the video thing soon enough.

1296
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,000
Sorry, I didn't get any video this time.

1297
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,780
Just check it out on OLRPSP.com and huge, huge video things to come.

1298
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:53,140
We're very, very excited.

1299
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,360
And I guess that's that.

1300
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,940
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1301
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:59,420
Your final thought, Spike.

1302
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:00,940
Why did I have to go first?

1303
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:02,840
Loki, your final thought.

1304
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,860
My lap is on fire because of this laptop.

1305
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:10,640
My final thought is Resident Evil 4, bitch!

1306
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,640
Have a great week.

1307
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:33,260
See you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1308
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,640
You get to fight, fight
