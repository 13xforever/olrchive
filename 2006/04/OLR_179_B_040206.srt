6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,120
with a grain of salt.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,200
One thing that is the real deal, though, we have a special guest here joining us for Part

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,000
B. Say hello, everybody, to OLR favorite Miklotov.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Miklotov Hello.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How you doing?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Miklotov I'm fine.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,200
And Miklotov, of course, works over at Konami.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Miklotov Yes.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,000
But due to NDAs, can't really tell us anything.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Miklotov Yes.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,160
Are there any good games coming out this year from Konami?

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
Miklotov Yes.

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,160
Miklotov Yes.

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,240
Okay, I guess that's about all we can figure out.

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,240
Can you tell us anything about sequels to popular franchises?

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,240
No. Can you tell us anything about Metal Gear 4? No.

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,240
So he'll be giving us one word answers all night long. He can tell you that it is coming out.

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Well that's public information, we've all seen the trailer.

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,240
Alright. How's Beatmania?

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,240
How's that doing? Yes.

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,240
You can talk about Beatmania now, it's out. I don't know, how is it

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:30,800
doing I have my coffee it sure is a great turntable controller all right

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,920
speaking of amiglotov will be chiming in throughout the segment tonight he's

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,240
gonna help us with a little game later on but for meanwhile let's let's keep

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,080
talking about music games one often overlooked music game on the ps2 might

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:49,240
be coming back soon dark soccer yeah maybe if I'm good if you eat your

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,640
vegetables and clean your room and make your bed I'll try guitar a man live to

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,140
PSP there are listings being put up by several of the Japanese retailers for a

34
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:06,260
PSP title called guitar a man live due out in Japan at the end of May no

35
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:13,000
details out nothing official has been said about it but the hints there you

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,220
never know I'm surprised we haven't seen a prep of the rapper game for a PSP

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,220
That's a good point as well. Why drag the system sales down further?

38
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,220
Hey! Parappa's awesome! You shut up.

39
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,220
I like how I'm Jammer Lammy. I don't like Parappa.

40
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,220
Do you think maybe the success of Guitar Hero is causing people to go, hmm, maybe we should go...

41
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:37,220
Of course, this is Japan now, not the US, but I would assume that if this comes out in Japan, we'd luck out and get it here in the US, too.

42
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,220
They need to bring out the Taiko No Tatsujin.

43
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,220
For the PSP?

44
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,220
Yeah.

45
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,220
Oh, that's right, they have one. Well, what's the point? There's no drum!

46
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,220
So?

47
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,220
So there's no drum!

48
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,220
It was fun.

49
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:52,940
tyke there's no Tyco in Tyco you hook it up to the USB yeah yeah speaking of

50
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:59,100
speaking of release you know rhythm music games I saw this at GameStop when

51
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,260
I went there the other day to get my game they have this thing called the

52
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,140
drum pad it's a dance pad but you don't dance on it you kneel next to it you hit

53
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,500
it with drumsticks is that not the lamest thing I have I mean have you

54
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,920
isn't that just a freestyle routine it's a really bad routine stupid and I can't

55
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:28,180
believe that they're selling that but I try it you would all right so I hope

56
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,780
that I hope that really I really do hope so and also I have to say that for the

57
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,460
message board for where we found this uh-huh I do think that whoever posted

58
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,660
this filler bunny it has the best name ever but anyway um you know I'm really

59
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:50,020
hoping that we see it because I mean the one problem with that though for anyone

60
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:56,820
who played guitar a man is they would have to really I think well the PSP has

61
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,140
good speakers on it though this is the thing because the Eurobeat on initial D

62
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:05,460
was sounding really good so that really though have to outdo themselves to make

63
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,100
the music sound as good as it did on the first one well Zander C is suggesting in

64
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,920
chat room over at orange launch radio click on chat here's what they should

65
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,980
call the sequel guitar o man fuck the sand bone trio is it anybody who's

66
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,040
played guitar o man had oh my through that stage I was getting hung up on the

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,740
stupid para para stage our UFO isn't that like the second stage I know I

68
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,420
love that song it's like it's like right at the end of it yeah not as good as the

69
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,360
Eurobeat song that's in there though that is the Eurobeat the fly there's

70
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
There's another song in there.

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
No, that's what you're thinking of.

72
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,480
No, that's the Eurobeat stage with the Para Para UFO.

73
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
My bad, my bad.

74
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Para Para Eurobeat.

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
Okay.

76
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
It's such a good song.

77
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
I know it is.

78
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
All right.

79
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
For the Zambon Trio.

80
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,280
That game is so good.

81
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,720
Moving on, another game that I think a lot more people are looking forward to, Loki,

82
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,080
we might have some news on.

83
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Yes.

84
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,800
There's a lot more fans of this one than Guitar Man.

85
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,560
I got to follow up on something we talked about.

86
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Okay.

87
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
Remember the Forerunner rumor, supposedly?

88
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Yeah.

89
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
That actually was in-game.

90
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Well, there was that Halo thing, right?

91
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,460
Okay, halo 3 that actually the whole article was in game informer and I actually got the read it. I don't know

92
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,960
What source they're taking it from whether I don't think it's gonna be

93
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,280
You know what? Halo 3 is obviously they're gonna call it

94
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,140
Halo 3 or Halo 4 runner or something like that, which will be Halo 3 like Ghost Recon advanced war fighter type thing

95
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
anyways, so

96
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,020
Supposedly the word on the street is

97
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:38,460
that IGN once again their anonymous source has found that that halo 3 is

98
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,900
supposed to be shipping March 2007 and is the story the story is not dated

99
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,500
April 1st no the story came out March 30th however it is close enough to that

100
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:55,220
but it sounds about right time wise I guess yeah they want to save it for the

101
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,980
holiday season? I mean it'll sell either way but you always pick your

102
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,340
biggest things at the holiday season I thought. Not if they think Sony or

103
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,100
Nintendo's plotting something around the same time frame. Maybe they think that

104
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,940
maybe that's when the PlayStation 3 is actually gonna launch. Who knows, who

105
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,860
knows. Yeah I'm kind of surprised they wouldn't try to release it in time for

106
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,100
Christmas but of course you know something like Halo you don't want to

107
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,140
screw that up. Technically that is in time for Christmas, just really early.

108
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,900
Wrong year, wrong year. Remember the rumors that the Halo 3 was supposed to

109
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,740
disrupt

110
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,180
the Sony PlayStation 3 launch? Didn't Gates say that or something?

111
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,220
I don't know. I'm really very happy if everything's been kept under wraps

112
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,620
like I think it has. Well, you think that this is

113
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,880
Microsoft's big thing at E3 because they don't have a new system to show off

114
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,180
this year. Now they've got to give us a big game. Or so we

115
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,460
so we know. Oh, that's true. They could have their portable that everybody's been

116
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,460
rumoring about, but...

117
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,740
Um, I think Halo 3 is definitely gonna be the thing that they kick off the focus of their

118
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,940
Announcements. It's gotta be I mean

119
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:06,560
All right, because that's what else are you gonna do in places? They're gonna be like, oh look how pretty everything is and you know

120
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,220
Nintendo's gonna be look how innovative everything is

121
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,460
Microsoft can be like look we have Halo 3

122
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,900
so

123
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
And the fanboys go. Yeah

124
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:23,340
Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention, three more games have been added to the compatibility

125
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,340
list.

126
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,340
Oh, really?

127
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:33,300
Winning 11-9, so some soccer for you, Black, and, god damn it, I forgot the last one.

128
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,300
That's alright.

129
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,900
Now, so, that whole, like, oh, Xbox 360 is going to be constantly updated with, you know,

130
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,900
new backwards compatible.

131
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
Bullshit!

132
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,900
We got three in the past couple months.

133
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,900
Okay, yeah, sure.

134
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,460
okay interesting it was just in time for their third relaunch of the system so I

135
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,540
can I can I can play Barbie but I still can't play DDR for Silent Hill all right

136
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,740
okay um speaking of which you bring this up we touched on this in the first part

137
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,700
of the show and I tried to kind of retell your experiences but how was it

138
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,860
at Best Buy this morning how did you come to find out that they were gonna be

139
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,180
doing the sale and all that good stuff um well I have a relative who works at

140
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,980
Best Buy and he informed me that Best Buy was doing yet another relaunch type

141
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:21,640
deal of the Xbox 360 and it was very hush-hush apparently. When we got there

142
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,780
it was only like 8.30 and nobody was there and by the time the place opened

143
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,840
there was about 10 people in line and they had about I think about 90 systems

144
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:39,320
and my first one was defective kind of in my own weird way and so I mean when I

145
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,680
I took it back right before they closed and they still had plenty of systems, so

146
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,560
There's a shortage over from what you saw

147
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,440
At that Best Buy. Yeah, right. There's nobody in there today. So

148
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,400
But I assume it's getting better now

149
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:00,380
After today, well, enjoy your 360. Maybe the second one that you're on now. I have to see if it works still

150
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:06,300
What games did you get? This is nothing and you tell us your gamer tags all the DDR fanboys can start adding you

151
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:12,620
Are you gonna get rumble roses xx no cuz I worked on that game, and I know it's not a good game Wow

152
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,020
Here's the point though

153
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,980
I know I can give that game for free because Konami loves our company and they send us free stuff and

154
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:28,420
Usually the people that work with me don't like the Konami stuff because they aren't into like you know music games and stuff and no

155
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,780
One has a 360 so I'm looking forward to getting rumble roses for free because I'm not buying the game

156
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,100
But um, I mean, no, it's just not you know, I didn't play dead or alive 4

157
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,340
I thought oh I got to get this game cuz you know, it's a really good fighting game. No, I didn't like it

158
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,720
But it looked fun because at least they're

159
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:54,160
Nipple-icious, I don't know the good thing about rumble roses double X is that it has really nice lighting and

160
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,260
Sometimes good graphics. I that's it

161
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,300
I want to make the most offensive looking character to play online me

162
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:08,100
Let's have your line because you you you told me yourself the photo mode was oh, oh, yeah photo mode if you're a dirty dirty

163
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
pervert

164
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,980
It is really good for you because you can take really really bad pictures and share them with your friends

165
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:24,200
When we were testing it, I guess some reviewers in Mexico had already gotten it. I don't know why Mexico has systems

166
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,260
but

167
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,300
like

168
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,020
They had pictures for us to download and I swear

169
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,180
Seen things that bad in a long time

170
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,380
Wow

171
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:48,240
Dark Sakura any interest in taking dirty photos on rumble roses double X and sending them to all your friends. No

172
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,380
That sure beats, you know seeing the spam check out my burnout clip

173
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,020
I I wish I so wish things that worked out so you could have gone away saying it

174
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:03,020
So what you're saying is you can actually spread those clips online. Yeah, you can download them

175
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,760
they have like

176
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,260
This place where you can just download photos that people have uploaded and you can do whatever you want with them now

177
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,260
Now, can you download them if you don't have the game?

178
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:19,240
No, cuz it's a it's like a an option in the game to ah, damn because we could have a totally awesome contest

179
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,620
You know rubber roses xx dirty photo contest who can make you do it also put like outlines around your pictures

180
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,940
So when we were testing it we had two of the chicks, you know

181
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,740
Really close to each other and we put a heart around it. It was pretty funny and cute

182
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,460
But that game is worthless. It's so confusing and not fun

183
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Interesting

184
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,460
Like the actual game, all right, let's move on talk about some other news

185
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,660
Do you guys remember the whole flowers for Jack like that was like weeks ago?

186
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,660
We actually gave money to that

187
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,660
Well now it turned into this whole other thing that pixel on T is now what they're calling themselves

188
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:03,220
Well, they're selling shirts now and game politics ran a story on this earlier in the week. They are selling their t-shirts

189
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,380
They are able to be purchased now on

190
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,860
Zazzle which I think is a competitor to cafe e-press or whatever that is. So Zazzle sells us now

191
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,620
you can see it at zazzle comm slash pixel anti charity and

192
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,180
Shirts are around $15. But here's the part for every

193
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,880
sociopath with a mouse as

194
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:29,280
Jack Thompson calls it for everyone that buys one of these shirts game politics is going to donate all the profits to the get well

195
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,220
Gamers foundation just to rub it in Jack Thompson's face that gamers are always up to no good

196
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,480
So here's a chance to you know, get a shirt and give to charity at the same time and show yourself as a proud pixel anti

197
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
Jackie poo is so full of shit

198
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,360
Is that what you want on a shirt there? Yes, I want that actually, you know

199
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm gonna I've actually started working on this picture. I'm gonna go ahead and tell everybody

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:00,240
about putting a Jack Thompson's head on a donkey and making a jackass shirt

201
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,040
because no actually he couldn't say it was harassment because it's legal under

202
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:12,200
parity I don't know all right let's go over now to dark Sakura dark Sakura

203
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,520
likes to surf the interweb and she scones it up and down day in day out and

204
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,720
she finds at work and she finds that one website special enough to share with you

205
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,000
kids in a little segment we call Dark Soccer's Website of the Week, correct?

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes. Today's website of the week is Kingdom Hearts Ultimania, which is one of

207
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,760
my absolute favorite Kingdom Hearts sites for a long, long time. Not only does

208
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,800
this place have like stories on here, it has information about final mix, images,

209
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:52,680
artwork, videos, audio, you name it, it has lyrics, translated, they have it in the kanji,

210
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,680
romaji, english, everything. It's really, really just an excellent site. You can get

211
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:07,360
there by going to www.kh2.co.uk. Very, very good site. Excellent forums, it's just really

212
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,080
top notch as far as, it's the place to go for Kingdom Hearts information.

213
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,580
So all those fanboys and fangirls that somebody labeled it earlier?

214
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,580
Place for them to convene.

215
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,580
Go convene!

216
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,580
Talk about cosplay.

217
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,460
Go play!

218
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,200
Dream worlds they want to see in a future Kingdom Hearts?

219
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,420
All that good stuff.

220
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:31,400
It's really, it even has, the gallery has so much in it, you can just sit there and

221
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,040
look at the fan art forever.

222
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,280
They don't have Slash do they?

223
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,280
Because that stuff is scary.

224
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
The Kingdom Hearts Slash.

225
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,840
I usually try not to look at it.

226
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,200
I didn't play the first game, but I read a lot of Slash thanks to my friend.

227
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:53,880
I've seen some very interesting yaoi doujinshi posted a while back, very interesting stuff.

228
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,200
It was very disturbing because they're children, and I was like, why am I looking at this?

229
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,880
You know what was better about the Slash than the first game?

230
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
Had a better camera.

231
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,400
Oh, that was a Kingdom Hearts joke, I get it.

232
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Yeah, it was.

233
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,980
Loki speaking of trashy things

234
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,900
Are kids able to still pick them up those trashy trashy games the evil games that Jack Thompson says we play well the Federal Trade Commission

235
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,600
released some results with

236
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,940
Of their actual there in nationwide undercover

237
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,340
sting operation guests of

238
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,700
electronic and video game stores. They were basically checking to see if people are still

239
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,860
selling these games to minors. And well, actually they found that it's been a decrease.

240
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:49,900
According to the survey here, 42% of the secret shoppers, children between the ages of 13 and 16,

241
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,860
who attempted to buy an M-rated video game without a parent, were able to make a purchase.

242
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:08,040
However, it says in 2003, the percentage was 69%, so it's actually gone down quite a bit.

243
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:16,500
And it says now there's more stricter sales of M-rated games and only about 35% of Secret

244
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,100
Shoppers were able to purchase them now, so I don't know.

245
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,820
I bet you, you know, 35 is still kind of a high number for this stuff, you know?

246
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,880
I just feel like we're still going to not hear the end of this.

247
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,180
There's no actual laws in place for this in

248
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,980
most states. There's no real laws for this so

249
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,060
I mean it's just a recommendation. And it's all company enforced so

250
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,900
thirty-five percent is down that's actually pretty awesome that a company

251
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,580
can enforce their

252
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,460
their will upon their employees to make sure they check

253
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,540
for ID and stuff like that.

254
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,940
Well, one thing you wonít be needing your ID to buy anytime soon might be a UMD movie

255
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,200
because the rumor is these things are on their way out the door.

256
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,140
Rumor is that Hollywood studios and Wal-Mart are looking to drop the format that they may

257
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,880
not be carrying this much longer.

258
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,380
This is very interesting.

259
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,880
Paramount had a quote here, ìReleasing UMD format movies is the exception rather than

260
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,520
the rule.î Universal Studios, one executive over there, was quoted saying, ìI donít

261
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,980
Sales are near zilch. It's another Sony bomb ooh

262
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,880
Burn

263
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,060
Has anybody actually tried to watch a UMD movie cuz it's I did on the plane

264
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,600
I did on a plane too. I did too

265
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,080
I tried to watch spider-man 2 because it came with my system, and it was not fun to watch

266
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:43,020
I watched Hellboy. I saw I saw Tron. Yeah. It was fine Tron looked pretty hot

267
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:49,140
They have nice, those PSPs have nice screens. The problem is those movies are

268
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,500
twenty-something dollars, in some cases more expensive than what they are on DVD

269
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,060
and I can't play those on my DVD player. And you don't get the bonus features for the most part.

270
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:03,580
That's right, that's the problem. So the format, it was a good idea at first, I

271
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,540
think, but I think the problem is there's no, if there were players that supported

272
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,980
UMD, hell, even if they would announce that the PlayStation 3 would support the UMDs,

273
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,540
which, what, you just pointed, what, Loki?

274
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,980
Actually, there, I thought that was one of the things they're going to announce at E3,

275
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,700
is that there will be some sort of way to play UMD movies on TVs.

276
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,780
Well, it's maybe too late.

277
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,780
I think it's stupid.

278
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,700
I mean, okay, good, you can play a UMD movie on TV, okay, why do I have to buy a UMD movie

279
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,020
over a DVD then?

280
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,020
That's right.

281
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,780
There is no reason.

282
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,380
So goodbye UMDs, we hardly knew ya.

283
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,780
And that makes me sad and a little bit angry at times.

284
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,860
So I think it's time we get a little bit angsty here on Orange Lounge Radio.

285
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,620
Dark Sakura, do you agree?

286
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,620
On occasion.

287
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:16,500
My F.U. of the week would have to go toward Mt. Mike's Pizza.

288
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:22,380
It was very nice of my boss to buy our team pizza and she was very thoughtful to get vegetarian

289
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:28,220
pizza. Except that I reacted to this vegetarian pizza the way that I react to meat. My stomach

290
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:33,700
hurt like I had been doing a bajillion crunches. And yet I felt very full. I felt this way

291
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:40,700
until yesterday morning. So a big F.U. goes to notlikespizza for trying to play for me.

292
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:48,220
Loki! My F.U. goes to Best Buy and the stupid person that they have working in their camera

293
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,460
department in their site store guy wasn't needed asking questions I was

294
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,300
buying a video camera yesterday and I asked them okay what's the difference

295
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,020
between this camera and this other camera that was newer okay well that

296
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,500
didn't tell me anything you dumbass I could tell that by looking at it so

297
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,420
completely useless however I did find a camera after having to drive a half an

298
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:16,980
hour to the Elk Grove store so that sucked that stupid drivers my f-u goes

299
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,060
to male PMS because I think I've had that all weekend. I know you can't tell during

300
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:26,600
the show because I'm my peppy self, but I've had male PMS. It sucks. Not that I'm not having

301
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,760
woman issues, but you know that whole study that shows that men get that chemical imbalance

302
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,340
that makes them all moody too once every so often? I think I have that this weekend, so

303
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:42,680
Be careful around me, I'm in my brain, in my head, yes.

304
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,240
The area bet- nevermind, I'm not gonna go there.

305
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,140
The other area's just fine.

306
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,900
It's my brain.

307
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:56,460
As many people throw their iPods out the car window in horror at that thought, uh, eh,

308
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,460
they won't be missed.

309
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,460
I mean, shut up.

310
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,340
Miklataav, do you have an F.U. of the week you'd like to go?

311
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,340
Yeah, of course.

312
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,100
like Loki, my F.U. goes to the best buy, Citrus Heights, for treating me like a

313
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,340
criminal, for wanting to take back my 360 today because I had issues with it. And

314
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,860
when we were walking my new one over to the counter so they could kind of fake

315
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,300
bring me up to swap it out, the guy from media was like, there's another person

316
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,500
taking back their 360? Do they not know how to work it or something? I wanted to

317
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,780
punch him. And preemptive F.U. to Microsoft because I have a feeling this

318
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,360
one will be broken too. Then I'm going to give an F.U. to the Best

319
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,360
Buy at Citrus Heights too for giving me PMS. Somehow. I walk too close to a television

320
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,640
or something and suddenly bam. And I say F.U. to my jeans for my chromosome

321
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,160
patterns for giving me PMS. On the fact that I'm female.

322
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,040
I thought you meant like the jeans you're wearing.

323
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,320
No, the jeans that I'm wearing are actually quite comfortable.

324
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,160
They do not deserve an F.U. DJ Pooeater is so a winner in the chatroom.

325
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,400
He says, I get PMS every month. He's a man, he's a mini. I get PMS every month. It's the

326
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,360
It's a day after my wife's PMS.

327
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
That's a joke.

328
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Get it?

329
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Ha.

330
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
Ha.

331
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Ha.

332
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
Ha.

333
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,360
I laughed.

334
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,000
Wouldn't it be the same day because she's bugging him?

335
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,800
No, but like he's so exhausted after helping her.

336
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Ohhh.

337
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Forget it.

338
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Forget it.

339
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Men have no idea what PMS is like.

340
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
I don't know.

341
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,240
You have no way of knowing what PMS is like.

342
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,240
I don't know.

343
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,140
The day that you grow a uterus and it decides to...

344
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:34,060
With the exception of the, you know, the birds and bees part that you learned about in fourth

345
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,660
grade and the biological element of it all, I don't know.

346
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,260
Some days I get pretty grumpy and irritable.

347
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,980
Okay, I do know that...

348
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,980
Ask my loved ones.

349
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,300
And I crave junk food too.

350
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,780
I go through the whole motions.

351
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,860
It's short of the physical aspect of...

352
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
PMS.

353
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,860
That.

354
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
Anyway, sorry.

355
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,860
Loki, please bring this back to games.

356
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,860
Okay.

357
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:10,860
Well, there's actually been a recall on the Pelican Power Brick battery charger.

358
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:16,860
It's basically this giant brick that you attach to your PSP that gives it more battery life.

359
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:23,860
Unfortunately, there's a little problem with it being that, well, it overheats and it's actually caused fire damage.

360
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,820
damage.

361
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,780
According to the website...

362
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,620
Who would have thought that something called the power brick might be dangerous?

363
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:40,900
According to the website, powerbrickrecall.net, there has actually been 143 reports of the

364
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,460
recalled battery charger overheating, including one report of fire damage.

365
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,100
No injuries have been reported.

366
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:54,860
Also that, you know, so basically what you need to do, and they give you some information

367
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:00,580
of hotlines to call, you need to send it back, um, I don't know, there's better batteries

368
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:09,240
out there to be honest, so, I don't know, anyways, yeah, so don't buy these battery

369
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,700
accessories, you know, for your PSP, because to be honest, it lasts long enough as it is.

370
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,200
Alright, so I was checking out GameTap this week and I noticed that they added a lot of

371
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,080
new features to GameTap because, well, I'd heard on the internet these rumors that they

372
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,100
were going to be adding new things, so I decided to check it out over at GameTap and it's kind

373
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,720
of neat because now they have all these video on demand things and do you remember when

374
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,420
we were interviewing that guy from GameTap here on the show a few weeks ago?

375
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,420
Yeah.

376
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,520
He kind of hinted at some of this, I think, because we asked him about if GameTap was

377
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,120
going to be like a television network and I think he had these bigger and better ideas

378
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,940
you're kind of seeing this stuff in motion now is that you can get the

379
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,600
videos on demand yet the music video on demand and some of their shows which

380
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,480
might I say are actually better than a lot of the shows I've seen on g4 in the

381
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,020
past you know six months you mean Star Trek and bonds I know like think no

382
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,260
things actually relating to games and presented by people that seem to actually

383
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,800
enjoy games it's something unreal there so um game tap by the way is also added

384
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,740
I guess neo geo stuff now because I checked out baseball stars and then they

385
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,740
They also have Darkstalkers, so that means Capcom's on their way in too.

386
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,000
And I heard some rumor they're doing a big Street Fighter thing, so I just thought I'd

387
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,680
drop that out there.

388
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,380
But what's interesting, oh, they also lowered their price.

389
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,440
GameTap's now only, I think, $9.95 a month.

390
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,580
And I hate to sound like a marketing thing, because really, you know, GameTap has its

391
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,580
issues.

392
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,580
They still need multiplayer.

393
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,380
That would really help them sell their things.

394
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,140
But I do think it's a really just neat concept idea, and I hope it's successful.

395
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,160
But a lot of people are saying it's doom and gloom, because, oh, price cut means they've

396
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,200
got to move things.

397
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,400
and not necessarily it could be just an incentive to get more people on you know

398
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:46,560
maybe $15 is a little too high people might go for 10 we'll see all right

399
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,680
Loki one game you can play on game tap is Tomb Raider but the old ones but

400
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,760
there's a new one coming right yeah well Tomb Raider legend right now is coming

401
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:02,440
out on PlayStation 2 Xbox Xbox 360 and PSP in May now the only thing it isn't

402
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:09,440
isn't coming out on is, you know, the Nintendo systems. No GameCube, no Nintendo DS. However,

403
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:16,600
it's possibly coming out later this year for them. And apparently, once again from IGN,

404
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:23,600
they have talked to Eidos and apparently Bill Gardner, the Eidos North America CEO and President,

405
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,620
the IDOS North America CEO and President

406
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,640
basically said Laura likes Reggie, you know

407
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,420
referring to Reggie over at

408
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,220
the Nintendo of America and basically

409
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,900
you know they're talking about it being

410
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:46,780
released later on possibly I don't know probably the end of the summer would be my guess

411
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:52,820
now the only thing though this was announced kind of around April Fools

412
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:58,140
so we don't know. Personally, I don't think it's gonna, because the GameCube is not really

413
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,420
a big system right now as far as releases go. There's like maybe two a month, and the

414
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,380
DS, well, you know, it's pretty good, but I don't see you being able to port this very

415
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,300
well over the DS, so I'm gonna call bullshit on this story to be honest. I don't think

416
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:19,420
it's coming out on the GameCube or any Nintendo system any time soon. Oh, that's my thought.

417
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,140
We'll see.

418
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,580
That's the problem with April Fool's Day, you don't know what to believe, but the Game

419
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,580
Cube, maybe the fact that a lot of people still own one and there isn't a lot of games

420
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,260
coming out for it is an incentive to put this game out on Game Cube, I don't know.

421
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,340
I think it'd be a waste of money.

422
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,860
Alright, well of course we all know one of the incentives to getting a revolution is

423
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,520
going to be the backwards compatibility with not only Nintendo products, but Sega and Turbo

424
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,060
Graphics as well, and we think we might know some of the games coming, possibly?

425
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,220
Well there was a wish list that was posted.

426
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,020
Game Daily had an article up where they put up a wish list of games.

427
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,240
And these were some of the ones that made the list, which are actually all games that

428
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,320
I own except for one, which is the last one on the list.

429
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,120
But the big thing about this is that there are some really good games listed on here.

430
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,020
Now it was posted on April 1st, so I am a little bit leery, but I'll go ahead and read

431
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,020
it off.

432
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:22,820
Gates of Thunder, Lords of Thunder, Blazing Lasers, Neutopia, Neutopia 2,

433
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:28,820
Ys I and II, Ys III, Wanderers from Ys, Devil's Crush, Alien Crush,

434
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,860
Keith Courage and the Alpha Zones, Why? Dear God, Why? Ninja Spirit,

435
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,860
Keith Courage was not that great, Bonk's Adventure, Bonk's Revenge, Dracula X,

436
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:44,860
Rondo of Blood, ah, sexy game, Splatterhouse, and Air Zonk, which of those

437
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,700
those are the ones I do not own as Arizona.

438
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,180
All right.

439
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,820
Okay, so what we have to do now to follow that up

440
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,860
is we have to make a wish list of our own.

441
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,340
And you know there's only one way we can do that, right?

442
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,060
Right, now are we going to be including

443
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,020
the games that were already on this list

444
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,860
if we'd really like to see them?

445
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,700
I think so because those are,

446
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,940
I mean, those are all the really good turbo graphics ones.

447
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,700
I think we need to let those on the list.

448
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,900
Because I have one I want to use.

449
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
So anyway, the way we do it around here,

450
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,820
if you've never heard it before,

451
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,940
the way we make lists is through a little segment

452
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,940
We call...

453
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,940
Listless!

454
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:19,480
Cue the game show music, because that's what it's like, one big game show.

455
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,980
Here's how Listless works, those of you folks listening live right now on orangelaunchdata.com

456
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,820
Sunday night, you have the chance to interact with this segment, you're going to help us

457
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,740
build the definitive list, tonight's topic.

458
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:37,940
Games we most want to see from Sega and NEC on the Nintendo revolution, besides Sonic,

459
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,660
because we all know Sonic would happen.

460
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,660
That's a given.

461
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,780
We got to think outside the box so games we most want to see on the revolution besides

462
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,260
Sonic from Sega and NEC.

463
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,380
So the way it works you guys, we're going to go around and give our top 3, myself, Loki

464
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,300
Dark Soccer and our guest Miklotov, we'll give our top 3.

465
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,020
Then the fun part comes, we take one off of the list, each of us, and then you guys, the

466
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,940
chat room, get the final say, you get two votes, a number 1 and a number 2 in what you

467
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,620
think should be on the wish list.

468
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,620
And maybe we'll send this wish list to Nintendo and Sega and NEC somehow.

469
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,800
We'll look in our little black book and see if we have some addresses we can send this

470
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
to.

471
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Alright!

472
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
So, here we go.

473
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Who wants to start us off tonight?

474
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Dark Soccer, you want to start us off?

475
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Sure.

476
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,720
Alright, what is your number 3 pick for Sega or any C game you most want?

477
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
I am making a disclaimer.

478
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Okay.

479
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,800
Two of the games I would really like to see on there I'm not going to list because nobody's

480
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
heard of them.

481
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Like Emerald Dragon and Sapphire.

482
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
Gotcha.

483
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,800
But I suggest people give them a try if they can.

484
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Okay.

485
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,320
So my number 3 is Star Parodia, which also probably only a handful of people have heard

486
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,320
of.

487
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:59,320
It's a shooting game featuring a flying Bomberman, a flying PC Engine, and a Super Deformed Viper.

488
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,320
So it was this cute little game, like if you play as the PC Engine, which I always did,

489
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,320
you could shoot out CDs and cue cards as your firepower. It was really cute.

490
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Alright, very cool.

491
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
Loki, what's your number 3?

492
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,320
My number 3...

493
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,320
I would have to say...

494
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,320
Splatterhouse.

495
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,320
That game's fun.

496
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,320
You gotta love a game that kind of mocks Friday the 13th

497
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,320
and has a guy that's main weapon is a 2x4.

498
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
Mikletov, your number 3 pick.

499
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Um, I have a disclaimer too.

500
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
All my games are really random.

501
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
Okay.

502
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,320
So my number 3 would be Panic,

503
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,320
because that game was awesome and very scary when I was little.

504
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,140
on the Sega CD oh my god I first thought I'd never heard of this game and oh my

505
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,440
god I have heard of panic that little kid and push buttons and things and you

506
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,440
go to another room taking places and it's scary but I loved it okay sounds

507
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,120
good my number three pick would have been a splatter house was actually my

508
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,840
number three so I'm gonna have to choose something else I would say devil's crush

509
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,800
I think it's gonna be a number my number three pick because it was a badass

510
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,120
pinball game so I'm gonna go with the devil's crush for sure

511
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,760
Alright, DarkSakura, what's your number two pick?

512
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,240
My number two pick was a game that was on Sega CD as well, Popful Mail.

513
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,000
Actually, Working Designs brought it out in the US.

514
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Really fun, cute little translation. Very, very hard to get your hands on a copy of

515
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,600
this now.

516
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,760
But it's a little side-scrolling adventure RPG.

517
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,080
Now I've never heard of this game, I have to admit. Did I spell it right there?

518
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,320
Popful? P-O-P-F-U-L and then mail as in

519
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:43,320
It was such a cute little game. I'll bring over my Sega CD one day so you can see this game.

520
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,320
It was one of the Working Designs projects back in the day.

521
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,320
You know the types of games that Working Designs brought us.

522
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,320
Loki, you're number two.

523
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,320
Um, my number two.

524
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
No, it was kind of a fun game.

525
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,320
Oh, Shadow Dancer.

526
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,320
Mm.

527
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,320
One of the best Shinobi games.

528
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
Shadow Dancer was excellent.

529
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,320
Oh, okay. All right.

530
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,320
Miklotov, your number two pick.

531
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
Moonwalker.

532
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
Moonwalker! I knew somebody had to say that.

533
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Um, because that game was super cool.

534
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
Smooth criminal.

535
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,940
your hat. Uh, my number two would be one of the greatest and most overlooked Sega CD games

536
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,540
of all time. And remember that this is, you know, and we don't even know if Sega CD games

537
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,300
are gonna end up on Nintendo Revolution, but just the whole idea of seeing this on the

538
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:40,100
revolution would make me giggle in places I didn't even know I had. Night Trap is my

539
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:45,100
number two pick. I had What's Her Face in it. With Dana Plato. Yeah. Who? She's dead

540
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:51,880
Can you just imagine Nitra on a different strokes on the on the Nintendo revolution come on?

541
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:57,340
How ironic would that be all right number one picks guys Dark Sakura start us off

542
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:02,260
What is your number one pick for Sega or NEC game you want the Dracula X Rondo of blood?

543
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,940
most sexy Castlevania game in existence

544
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,600
All right, I'm so glad that my friend owed me money

545
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Is that how you got it? Yeah, one of my friends who's done some translation work for us. She was in our room at AX a few years ago. She owed us $100. She came back from Japan with Dracula X.

546
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,600
Nice exchange. I say so.

547
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Loki, your number one pick. You know what I really don't know why they haven't done a next gen version of this yet? Road Rash.

548
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,960
They did do a Road Rash. Yeah, but not next-gen.

549
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,960
There hasn't been anything since, like, uh... There was one on PlayStation.

550
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,640
Yeah, the original PlayStation, maybe... There was one on the 3DO.

551
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:52,520
I remember the 3DO one. Alright, what was Road Rash all about? I remember the name, but I remember the game.

552
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:57,080
Road Rash is basically motorcycle racing and combat. So you're, you know, riding

553
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,080
motorcycles and hitting people with chains and baseball bats and stuff.

554
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,440
Oh! I've seen the Final Fantasy VII. Okay, I have played that game before.

555
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,320
Alright, sounds good. Let's see, our chat room says

556
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,200
GK128 says Road Rash was E3, but there was one on PS2 that was canned.

557
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,320
So I guess they started to do one and didn't.

558
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,520
Miklotov, your number one pick. This is a game nobody will know,

559
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,600
so it should get kicked off right away. It's called Zoom.

560
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,720
It's on the Genesis, you know that? I know Zoom. That game is so awesome. Isn't that a puzzle game?

561
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,720
Yes! That game sucked! No, that game was sweet! That game was awful! It was an MTV game, wasn't it?

562
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,180
What? Yes, I think it was. No, you're thinking zoop. Oh, I am thinking of zoop. Okay. This is also a puzzle game

563
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:45,360
Okay, you're like this pig head thing with legs and you drew squares and you had to watch out for the scrubbing bubbles things

564
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Okay, that's kind of cool. You're out

565
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,480
You're thinking that game was awful. No, this is like, okay, really old first generation Genesis game

566
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
All right, so I get I get the last say

567
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,380
Number one pick. I was really tempted to do toe jam and Earl

568
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:05,120
I'm sorry Chad because I like chat room is yelling out to a general but I have to do this for the simple irony if

569
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,280
You were a kid when this whole

570
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,220
Thing went down you would know why I have to say

571
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,880
Mortal Kombat the Genesis version has to be on the Nintendo revolution

572
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:23,060
So Nintendo finally gets some Mortal Kombat with blood in it and not sweat and really small characters. Yes

573
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,480
there actually was a blood kid for this SNES one that changed the

574
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,080
You had to have the game genie, right? So it was basically a hex crack thing.

575
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,420
No, it's not the same. So I want to see Mortal Kombat in full blood glory

576
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,800
on the revolution. I do have to say that DJ Pooh Eater labeled a game that I'd have to

577
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,560
make a

578
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,040
a modification to. This would be like my number five, I think. Alice Kidd in Shinobi World

579
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,760
from the Master System. Oh, that's a good one.

580
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,840
Or Wonder Boy in Monsterland. Alright,

581
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Here's the list as it stands right now.

582
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,280
Star Parodia, Splatterhouse, Panic, Devil's Crush,

583
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,280
Popful Mail, Shadow Dancer, Moonwalker, Night Trap,

584
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,200
Dracula X, Rondo of Blood, Road Rash,

585
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,560
Zoom, and Mortal Kombat.

586
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,560
Boy, this was way more random than I thought it would be.

587
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,760
We're weird.

588
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,600
All right, but here it is.

589
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,520
Here's the part to get rid of the most weird stuff.

590
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,760
We eliminate one pick before we let the chat room vote.

591
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,600
So Dark Sakura, what's coming off the list?

592
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,720
Um, Night Trap.

593
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,620
Aww, you're no fun.

594
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,940
Cuz, Dan and I tried to play through that game, and it was so stupid.

595
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,700
But it's Slumber Parties, and Dana Plato, and Zombies!

596
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:40,360
You know, if I wanted to watch Stupid, I could watch, like, the Toxic Avenger movies.

597
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,900
Loki, what's coming off this list?

598
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,900
You know, I should've put Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

599
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,100
Zombies Ate My Neighbors was cool.

600
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,380
But that was on Super Nintendo too, wasn't it?

601
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,500
Yeah, so that's why we can't.

602
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,000
There's a chance.

603
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,500
There's a chance.

604
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,500
Um, Zoom, I've never heard of that game.

605
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Aww, such a great game.

606
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Alright, Miek Latov, what's coming off the list?

607
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Um, just because I think my company likes to be evil,

608
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Dracula X is gone.

609
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
Oh!

610
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,500
I don't think Konami would let that happen,

611
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
because we're jerks.

612
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
Alright, wow.

613
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,500
That's, I think that would have won.

614
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,500
That would have won, too.

615
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
I can't believe I didn't say Bomberman, either.

616
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
No, yeah, nobody said Bomberman

617
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:26,200
Stupids he's had Bomberman on Super Nintendo. Oh, that's true. But it was completely different on Genesis though. That's true. All right

618
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:31,180
64 is pretty fun. See you see Jamie. I won't take it off. I want to okay. Matt didn't have one taken off

619
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,180
So I'm gonna be fair. I'm gonna take off

620
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,820
Mmm, I don't know

621
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,980
I'm gonna take I

622
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:47,060
Actually kind of like his picks. Well, I'm gonna take off road rash because it's too much of a gray area

623
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,900
Because like, you know, they're kind of was an x-gen one. So but not really so and plus I didn't really

624
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,940
That's the same thing that Final Fantasy says it's a kitchen

625
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,980
All right, here it is you guys can vote for your favorites in chat room right now star Parodia

626
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,460
Splatterhouse panic devil's crush

627
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:15,660
Potful Mail, Shadow Dancer, Moonwalker, and Mortal Kombat. So send a private

628
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,100
message to Sky in the chat room with your number one and your number two picks

629
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:25,140
and we'll let you know at the end of the show who the winners are. And boy did

630
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,100
we end up weird. That was a really weird list. I sort of wish that now that I put Emerald

631
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,340
Dragon on there because Emerald Dragon was such a good game. I wish that they

632
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:36,680
would say let's bring Saturn games on because then I could say you know

633
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,160
freaking black matrix cuz that game would never that game will never come

634
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,440
out over here I think though even though our list is really random I think that's

635
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,000
a good thing because we're thinking of titles that a lot of people sometimes

636
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,440
don't think of right away when they think of Sega Genesis me everybody

637
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,800
thinks of Sonic but you know I think this is good but there's there's also

638
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,440
those some pretty you know they were pretty mainstream games on there cuz

639
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:03,960
devil's crush and shadow dancer those were really popular I remember just

640
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,100
sitting in the same room watching Dan play through Shadow Dancer and I was

641
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,140
like yeah this game is awesome because you have a dog yeah that's why I

642
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:15,840

649

Have email from

650
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:58,060
Well I guess I think this is saccharina, I think but didn't sign it about

651
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:07,340
First of all, I'll just go ahead and read the email.

652
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,860
First things first, I played Supernova.

653
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,860
It was awesome.

654
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,860
I really enjoyed it.

655
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,940
The left pad was kind of sticky, but the music was awesome.

656
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:20,780
I highly recommend Seduction Vocal Mix, but yes, it was really awesome and it looked nice.

657
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,860
The next one is from the other Jamie, who spells the name differently.

658
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:29,620
Remember the fun last year with the Mega Man Effect, though it only could run on a Mac?

659
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,620
They ported it.

660
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,740
Oh, the Mega Man Effect thing, I remember that.

661
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,480
What's that?

662
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
When you would boot up a...

663
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,820
Check out the MySpace, there's a clip from the show on there.

664
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,820
MySpace slash...

665
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,820
MySpace.com slash...

666
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,820
I don't have time for MySpace.

667
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,820
Too bad.

668
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,820
There it is, that's all I'm giving you.

669
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,820
Jerk.

670
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:54,220
Um, our dear friend Rob with two Bs sent us an email about Sega Sammy.

671
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,220
I would also like to say Rob with 2 B's has a higher gamer score than anybody on my Xbox

672
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,220
friends list.

673
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,220
Congratulations my friend.

674
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:04,940
Just to go, he actually posted a bit of an article in here about Sega debuting a new

675
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,940
headquarters.

676
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:11,820
Sega Amusements, the US game factory that has emerged from the merger of Japanese game

677
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:17,260
giant Sega Corp and the equally powerful Sammy Corporation have held a grand opening recently

678
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:23,100
for their new 77,000 square foot sales development and game and prize warehouse facility in the

679
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:27,820
Chicago suburb of Elk Grove Village. Special guests at the event included

680
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:34,100
Sega Sami holding CEO Hajime Satomi who engineered the merger and oversee I'm

681
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,120
sorry and oversees the combined companies in Japan as well as local

682
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,940
dignitaries such as Mayor Craig Johnson. The combination has dramatically

683
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,180
enhanced the company's capabilities said Satomi through an interpreter. Take a

684
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,780
look around at what we have to offer and then think about what Sega can do in the

685
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:58,540
future so it's more Sega what can I say hopefully we'll see you some good things

686
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:04,780
come out of them I want to see more freaking planet Harrier now we also um

687
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:14,340
got an email from someone whose gamertag is L driver but IIE awesome like kill

688
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,520
bill yeah love it so I'm gonna go ahead and read this email out I found out

689
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,280
about your site slash show about three weeks ago and I've been listening ever

690
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,800
since. You put out great content that's not only really funny and informative

691
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,520
but also socially responsible and different in relation to gaming. Not to

692
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,640
plug another podcast but gamertag radio is also another place I hear similar

693
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,440
topics. As a 20-something working professional adult gay gamer or gamer

694
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,800
myself I was really appreciative to the segments in your past two shows about

695
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,040
how not all gamers are straight nerdy teenage boys. You guys also happen to be

696
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,080
darkly sarcastic about almost everything like me, so I find myself laughing out loud while

697
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:56,580
listening to your show in places like my subway ride to work or at my desk.

698
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,800
I do have one quick question for you three, who or what do you think will steal a show

699
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
at E3?

700
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,460
I personally think PS3 is becoming overhyped, especially in the past few weeks and that

701
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,600
Microsoft and or Nintendo will use E3 to surprise everyone.

702
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,600
What are your thoughts?

703
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,440
Thanks for putting out great shows and keep up the great work.

704
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,960
I actually got to see the videos from the Game Developers Conference, including all

705
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,760
the wonderful PS3 in-game shots. Ooh, does it look nice? I think the revolution will

706
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,420
be awesome.

707
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,660
I think it's going to be information overload this year. I think E3 is going to be so monumental

708
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,840
in a way you've never imagined. I don't think any one person can steal the show. I think

709
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,360
everybody is going to be constantly one-upping each other the whole day. I think if anybody,

710
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:38,900
I think Nintendo's got the biggest secret out there, and they have, they stand to either

711
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:44,300
really... Nintendo stands to either really wow us all

712
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,980
or really disappoint the shit out of us all so it could go either way

713
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,980
for me I but I think if anybody Nintendo's got the surprise

714
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,320
but I'm trying not to be a Nintendo fanboy but I think they've set

715
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,860
themselves up to either really really please or really really disappoint

716
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,220
this is actually my first launch E3

717
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,300
I don't count last year as a launch E3 because

718
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:08,140
really it was just the oh we're doing this we're doing this

719
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:14,380
DS launch one. I still don't consider that. A launch one is when we have like the major systems

720
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:20,140
coming out not just like a handheld and Dan was telling me about when um the Xbox was launching

721
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:25,740
and when everything else is coming out and I'm just like this year is going to be so humongous

722
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:30,060
on all fronts though I really do think Nintendo is going to steal the show in the end. I think

723
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,300
they've got something that they're not talking about that they're just going to go boom and we're

724
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:39,180
gonna see it kind of like they did with the DS like yeah that was a fun show

725
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,380
that was a fun one I still have my t-shirt so do I hey with the big brick

726
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,920
EDS I find it very hilarious that my t-shirt fit me when I got it and now

727
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:56,300
it's pajamas all right I was able to pull up mmm that um program oh the

728
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:02,180
Mega Man thing it's it's pretty funny I mean oh yeah that's great Firefox do do

729
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,180
do you do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

730
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,180
Do do do do do do do do.

731
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,180
Cute.

732
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,180
Oh yeah.

733
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,180
Very cute.

734
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,620
Yeah you better take that off the computer before Xtravr tries to go play World of Warcraft

735
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,160
because he's going to go, what the fuck.

736
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,740
Too bad you can't do the little trick where you turn the stars into chickens.

737
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,820
Who remembers that?

738
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,000
I do, I do.

739
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
That'd be a cool hack.

740
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
All right any more email?

741
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,940
Yes, there is more email, so, huh.

742
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,720
One of our listeners, Justin, has a question for us and I'll read his letter.

743
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,080
I noticed that Lemmings was out for the PSP, but only in the UK.

744
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,920
I was wondering if the UK version will play on my US PSP, and if so, what is the best

745
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,920
way to import this game?

746
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,880
Keep up the good work on the live show.

747
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,120
Is PSP region free?

748
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,120
I don't remember.

749
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,120
Yeah, PSP is region free.

750
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,120
There you go.

751
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,120
Import away.

752
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,280
Find whatever.

753
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,960
Make sure you check the Better Business Bureau before picking an importer.

754
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,960
Trust me.

755
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,040
And there's not, I haven't seen a lot dealing with games from Europe.

756
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,600
You would have to order from Amazon or something.

757
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,720
I know of a place but you don't like plugging places, do you?

758
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,880
Why not? Go ahead. NCSX actually, uh, imported

759
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,120
Well, yeah. NCSX is awesome. They were getting some of the, I knew that before they were getting

760
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,880
the Europe only Dreamcast games, too. And they have great customer service.

761
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,800
Yes, they do. Never buy anything from BuyRight. Or Toys and Joys.

762
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,280
Actually, Toys and Joys has given me nothing but good service. Really? Jerks.

763
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,200
I bought my, uh, my guitar controllers for, um, guitar freaks

764
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,980
from them for cheaper than anywhere else had them and they had just got their

765
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,400
shipment in and packed it up that day we caught we did a phone order hmm I got it

766
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,160
within like a week I have not shopped at any of those stores I've used to place

767
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,200
in the past called Japan video games because I went to their actual store

768
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,520
once and so I've been loyal ever since now we that's where I got my drum

769
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,020
controller from but now we just sort of take the drive to Berlin game and go to

770
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:53,560
network isn't network closed didn't they just close recently I don't think so

771
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,480
Cuz we were trying to go there the other day. They are closed on a weird day. I think they're closed on Tuesday

772
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,480
Anyway, we gotta go. Okay. Sorry

773
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,560
Yeah, worldwide show guys

774
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,940
Actually, that was the last email. Okay. All right, then send us more email more more more

775
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:14,440
We crave it mailbag orange on twitter.com. It's where to send it. All right, we will reveal the list list winner

776
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:22,640
Listless winner very soon. However, we have a couple stories real quick for you guys. Oh, what's this next week?

777
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,300
we will be rolling out a contest that's right we're not gonna say anything about

778
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:32,960
it but make sure that you tell everyone to tune in next Sunday because we also

779
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,080
of course it's going to be repeated on our podcast but we the first details

780
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,840
will be on our life so we're working with somebody else to do it yes it's a

781
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:48,400
big thing all right all right uh Loki you got a story for us yes I do now

782
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:55,140
Anyways, before I was playing with all this stuff here, basically we have information

783
00:48:55,140 --> 00:49:00,300
and it's not really much of a surprise because we knew this was going to happen, but they're

784
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:06,420
going to be announcing DOA Extreme Beach something 2 at E3.

785
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:11,660
Now, I'm not sure if it's going to be volleyball this time because I heard basketball is in

786
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:18,380
the room or they're going to do, but basically, yes, the jiggly game will be shown at E3.

787
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:32,860
Let's go on over to another story here I have on credit cards.

788
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:38,460
Now there's this interesting article here on makezine.com on their blog over there.

789
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,780
It's entitled, The Future of Credit Cards, Earning Virtual Currency for Spending in the

790
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,980
Real World and Other World Bridging.

791
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,580
I'm going to make this real quick.

792
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,900
I'm going to sum this up.

793
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:52,460
You know how sometimes credit cards give you rewards, such as frequent flyer miles and

794
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,940
things of that sort for every dollar that you spend?

795
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:01,380
Well now they're thinking of, why not give in-game currency as a reward for spending

796
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,460
money?

797
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:07,180
That would just screw up whatever currency, whatever economy you've got going on in that

798
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,180
environment.

799
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:13,900
So when you use your credit card on in-game currency, you can score more in-game currency?

800
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,540
Essentially.

801
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,400
Excellent.

802
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,280
So just kind of interesting there, it's a very lengthy blog, I'm not going to read all

803
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,000
the details there, if you want to check it out for yourself, check out from March 2006

804
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,960
there was a blog there, but it's just now, I mean it's an old blog, but it's just now

805
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,360
making the rounds on the gaming blogs, makezine.com is the name of the site there, and they go

806
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,520
into a lot of details there, but it's certainly an interesting idea, I mean nobody's really

807
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,400
thought of that before, but I don't know, most MMO hardcore players I know that might

808
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,640
actually sign up for something like this also hate gold sellers and gill sellers or whatever

809
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,440
the currency is in the game you're playing.

810
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,640
So I don't see this working, because I think there's a conflict of interest there, but

811
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,760
whatever floats your boat.

812
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,920

836
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,160
let's go to skype line hello you are on orange lounge radio hi hi who's this

837
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:52,120
Ravens dolphin hello Ravens dolphin what's on your mind buddy uh the UMD

838
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:58,900
movies yes what about them you a fan of UMD movies not at all I'm glad they're

839
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:06,300
going away. Why? Why? Because I haven't bought one since that movie. I bought one movie on

840
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:12,140
it. What was that? Evil Dead. That was about it. Well that's a good choice. You have good

841
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:16,820
taste in movies. It's all about Bruce Campbell and his chin. I suppose if you're going to

842
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:23,220
buy one UMD you might as well buy that or Tron or Evil Bill. Labyrinth. Something cool.

843
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:28,180
Starring David Bowie and his... Why the hate for the UMDs then? Were you just not impressed

844
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,800
with Evil Dead?

845
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,380
No, I was impressed with it. It's just I'm getting all my movies off BitTorrent

846
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,200
and I'm just encoding it on my computer.

847
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,440
I guess that's the realistic world of what PSP has to deal with is that

848
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,280
you know the kids want to hack it

849
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,240
and put their own movies on there so

850
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,680
it's a questionable legality thing there but I guess that's what people

851
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,840
are doing. Well the other thing too is they're also pushing these larger memory

852
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,920
sticks and what the hell are you going to use them for? Obviously not pictures. You're going to be ripping

853
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,380
DVDs or whatever to downloading great podcasts like orange lounge radio

854
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,960
Okay, but still though

855
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:08,300
Every week on my PSP. All right. All right. I hear you. Have you checked out olr PSP calm?

856
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,040
Can I plug another podcast right another site? Oh, all right. Sure

857
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,760
PSP drive calm it has your webs your

858
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,380
I've heard of that. I've seen our listing on PSP drive calm. It's a good site. I've actually used the portal. It's a nice site

859
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:31,820
yeah they have a PSP 2.0 and I just downloaded wirelessly to the PSP yeah

860
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,500
they were supporting podcasts before Sony was I think I think it's a good

861
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:40,500
site so yes and I see I've seen our little teeny like reduced version of our

862
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,100
graphic on there for PSP so I think is really cool because somebody obviously

863
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:47,060
had to take the work to do that so I really appreciate those guys so that's

864
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:52,300
awesome yeah oh I just want to say that I have two Windows computers just like

865
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:56,760
Loki uh-huh he's a big Windows supporter and I support Windows just like he does

866
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,480
well it's it's good to hear from a Loki fan because sometimes we get the hate

867
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,600
mails from the Mac users so all right have a good one okay thanks for calling

868
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:10,240
buddy hmm thanks guy not a problem take care of course if you don't know what

869
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,520
we're referring to their Loki has made comments about Macintosh's and he's

870
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:20,240
really sick of hearing about it too I think I'm yeah I just really I don't

871
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,240
don't care that's what happens when people download a show that's weeks and

872
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:28,820
weeks old let's go over to this one hello you're on orange lounge radio hey

873
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:36,880
I'm just hello hi who's this oh oh it's Ron McCallen in right now look you can

00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,280

875
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,000
video it's really hard for us to hear you but there there is a little little

876
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,480
Zelda hat that's that's cute Rama call back turn off the video and call oh

877
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,480
There it is.

878

It went off.

879
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,480
There you go.

880
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,480
Much better.

881
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,480
Much better.

882
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,480
What's on your mind?

883
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,480
Hey, I want to cover a couple of things for you guys.

884
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,480
Okay.

885
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,720
Remember when you were talking about Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors?

886
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,480
Yes, the game that was like, yeah, it ran on, I don't know.

887
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,920
I'm glad you called in on this.

888
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,920
What's up?

889
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:08,000
It seems that when I was listening to Penn Gillette's radio, his podcast, he talked about

890
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
the game.

891
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Really?

892
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
What did he say?

893
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Yes.

894
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,080
He used, basically the play of Smoke and Mirrors was to go after Janet Reno who hated violent

895
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,080
video games.

896
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,600
That's fabulous.

897
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:25,320
That's funny. I'm posting a link in the chat room now. If you scroll down you'll

898
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,360
find where you can download it. It's called

899
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:33,040
Penn & Teller's Real Life Games. Alright, it's 923-free-fm.com and you can

900
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,400
probably navigate the site from there if you're not in chat right now.

901
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,760
Yeah. Alright. Okay, what else, Rama? What else is on your mind?

902
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,240
Alright, let's go back to Catscom for a bit. Remember the awesome

903
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,640
Zelda skit everybody was talking about? Yes, the one I didn't see.

904
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:53,000
I'm posting a link to it right now. Oh, you can download it. Yeah, if you could scroll that all the way down

905
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It's called katsu

906
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,420
2006 dash link. Okay, and that video is on the website usagi-chan three dot-com

907
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,760
So check that out. All right post in our forums or something so people can find that link later

908
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,920
Did you guys see that Zelda fan movie? It's so amazing. I heard about it

909
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:14,540
Oh, that was awesome. It missed the cut for tonight's show, but because it's not really official but it's it's interesting

910
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:19,380
It would be interesting if they actually finish it and and and release it

911
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:25,060
But don't you think Nintendo is gonna bring down the swift hammer of justice on that matter necessarily. It's just fan stuff

912
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:30,380
It's just lunch on you need to you need to come to Fana me with us bottom a 2007

913
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:34,180
She died. We'll be here. All right, if our panels go over well

914
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:38,780
Did you tell your friends in the anime community to come to our panels? I mean

915
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,380
Unlike they did at Katsu khan

916
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:45,380
Look, you got screwed over. Believe you me, I'm just as pissed as you are.

917
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,380
I had to put a dig in there somehow. It's fine. I learned a lot. I learned a lot.

918
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:51,380
I did make sure to specify that our panel is on a Saturday.

919
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:56,380
Very cool. And I met some great people at Katsukana. That's the important thing.

920
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,380
So, that's the important thing.

921
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,380
And now there's a guy out there handing out flyers for us. It's awesome.

922
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,380
I love our fans. They're so great.

923
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:06,380
Rama, I gotta let you go so we can get to more of our listeners, okay?

924
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,380
You take care.

925
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,380
Have a good one, buddy.

926
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:12,900
good to hear, oop, I just cut him off sorry didn't mean to alright let's go to another call here

927
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:18,980
hello you're on Orange Launch Radio hello you are on Orange Launch Radio

928
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:22,520
no they're not, hello, hi who's this

929
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:27,620
this is Xander from China, hi Xander from China what's on your mind

930
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:31,100
isn't it kinda late over there right now

931
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,500
or early I don't know alright fine what's on your mind, 3 in the morning

932
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:40,500
Yeah, I've been talking about Kingdom Hearts 2 since it came out on Wednesday.

933
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,500
You wanna talk about what? You were dropping a little bit there. What game?

934
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,500
Kingdom Hearts 2.

935
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,500
Oh, what do you want to say about Kingdom Hearts 2?

936
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,500
I'm like 17 hours into it right now.

937
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,500
Yeah?

938
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:59,500
So, yeah, obviously I'm liking it quite a bit because otherwise I wouldn't have bothered going through all the stupid cutscenes.

939
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:04,420
Mm-hmm, but um, I think that's probably one of my biggest complaints about the game is that the cutscenes are really

940
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:11,580
They're really low quality in all honesty. Most of them are really I think the cutscenes have been great so far

941
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:17,500
Well, how far are you? I'm all I've just passed Beastcast. No, I'm in that

942
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,080
Well, I just got into the hundred acre wood

943
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,220
So I'm not super far but you know far enough to get a good taste

944
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,860
Especially after that prologue far enough to get a good taste of what the game's all about

945
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,420
So yeah

946
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:38,420
The worst one for me, though, that ruined it, was the one in Mulan, when the guys, whatever his face is, is charging down the mountain with all the Heartless.

947
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,420
Okay, don't ruin too much, don't ruin too much.

948
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,420
I played that part at E3, that was pretty awesome.

949
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,420
I like the Mulan world.

950
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:52,420
But no, during that cutscene, in the movie, there's this really dramatic music playing as he's running down the mountain with all his thousands of soldiers and whatnot.

951
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:57,400
Uh-huh, and then there's nothing there. There's like ten heartless chasing him and

952
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,600
There's no music

953
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:04,900
Are we I was so pissed off our chat rooms getting a little angsty with the spoilers thing

954
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:08,000
So we got to be careful what we say about the game, but I don't I I disagree

955
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,300
I thought it was but see I didn't see Mulan. So maybe that's why it's different as I didn't actually see Mulan

956
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,680
So I liked him on this by way

957
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:18,840
Have you gotten to the Little Mermaid level yet?

958
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,200
That level is cracked out.

959
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,040
I hate their costumes.

960
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,840
The part that's funny about that though is playing it in Japanese, hearing them sing

961
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,320
Under the Sea in Japanese is just hilarious.

962
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:38,200
I can't believe it's a music game where you press one button.

963
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,880
Xander, any other comments on Kingdom Hearts 2?

964
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,040
I've got to keep it moving because we've got a lot of people trying to call in tonight,

965
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,400
any other comments on Kingdom Hearts 2?

966
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,840
I'm really enjoying it, it's very different from the first game

967
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,340
so you know if you didn't like the first game you might like this one

968
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:55,600
although you wouldn't understand it if you didn't finish it. I agree but Miklotov

969
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,560
shaking his head no

970
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,920
because it still has a bad camera. It's much better, much better.

971
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,960
Still bad. All you do is lock on to the target and the camera follows it, it's easy.

972
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,360
In the first game you would lock on and the camera would still go behind

973
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,240
smokes and mirrors and everything and it made it a pain in the ass but this one's much

974
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:10,640
better.

975
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:15,920
I actually disagree on that really the camera is actually worse than this one. I had less problems screw you people

976
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,280
Okay, you know what though? I'll tell you what my favorite part so far

977
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,000
I know I just played this part, but that I don't want to give spoilers

978
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,140
But the the boss fight in Beast's castle was awesome

979
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:35,360
It was awesome. The end one. Yes, don't say much more. It was awesome. Oh, man. Yeah, that was good

980
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,740
All right, that's all I can say. Were you watching? Yeah, I was watching it. It was okay

981
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:44,160
I had a bad camera. All right, Xander. I gotta let you go before a shame pisses me off more. Okay?

982
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,780
Okay. All right. Have a good one. Bye

983
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:51,700
All right. Let's go. I'll do one more call. Hello. You're on orange launch radio

984
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,340
Hello, can you hear me? Yes, what's on your mind?

985
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,900
Um

986
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:05,700
I'm in a really hacky mood. You're in a hacky mood

987
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:10,800
Yeah, I've been hacking a lot of things recently, like physically.

988
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,800
Who is this, by the way?

989
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,800
I forgot to ask who this is.

990
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,800
Who is this?

991
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,800
Oh.

992
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,800
NintendoManiac64.

993
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,800
Hello NintendoManiac64.

994
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,300
Have you been hacking your Nintendo, or what have you been hacking?

995
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:24,020
No, I have a 360 controller that I use for my PC.

996
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:29,380
I modded the buttons and stuff, so I can pretty much make any button layout I want.

997
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:32,300
You know, I haven't even thought about doing that.

998
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,460
I read that on a forum this week, somebody just casually said putting their controller

999
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,680
in the PC and I thought that's a really good idea I could use that for like

1000
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:42,120
Final Fantasy and stuff does that work can I just plug it in and go or do I

1001
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:45,960
have to hack it? You don't have to you can download the the drivers off of

1002
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:50,160
Microsoft's site and I was asking the caller no that's fine that's fine but

1003
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,680
those drivers suck I don't know they worked fine for me what did you what did you find drivers out

1004
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:59,340
there you can get them off redcloud.com I'll post the link all right yeah post

1005
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:02,380
the link I'll check that out because I want to use it for Final Fantasy 11 on the

1006
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:06,380
Which is ironic because I want to get Final Fantasy XI on 360. I'm so sad.

1007
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:09,380
Yes, we are sad. Yeah, you're doing it too.

1008
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:14,380
What do you find that you're using the Xbox 360 controller for on the PC?

1009
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:17,380
Are you emulating games, or what are you doing with it?

1010
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:23,380
I do some of that, but not much because my computers are so much crap that I can't do much of that.

1011
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:31,380
Like, pretty much the main thing I do is I play F-Zero Climax.

1012
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:38,460
that's cool very cool yeah all right I did some other hacking

1013
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:44,540
okay what else let's see um oh yeah I got a my standard headset mic that I'm

1014
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:50,300
using right now to work with my DS oh is that why you were saying in chat earlier

1015
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,100
in the show that you really wanted to play Metroid with somebody for voice

1016
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:57,580
chat yeah I wanted to test it out gotcha you know I played my first multiplayer

1017
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:02,380
Metroid last night finally I owned at it I just like to say yeah it was when you

1018
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,300
were sleeping it was fun good you were sleeping because you had to go to best

1019
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,740
by at 3 a.m. because you were afraid there was gonna be a huge line yeah I'm

1020
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:12,620
stupid all right there's no maniac 64 I gotta let you go because we're running

1021
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:15,860
really long here but have a good one okay okay all right bye-bye

1022
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:20,100
all right thanks to our callers tonight for calling in and all the calls went

1023
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,300
pretty well tonight I must say it was very good I'm sorry to those calls we

1024
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:28,820
didn't get to another time perhaps we'll see all right for now though we're going

1025
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:33,860
to get into the last few segments here in the show and we started off with any

1026
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:36,660
last-minute stories does anybody have any last-minute stories I want to share

1027
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:43,860
Dark Sakura yes remakes remakes are good things especially when it has to do with

1028
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:50,740
sometimes yeah well Panzer Dragoon and Die Hard okay I've got my attention okay

1029
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:55,460
um apparently there's going to be um well actually there's a little bit of talk about

1030
01:04:56,020 --> 01:05:01,220
them wanting to do a panzer dragoon orta remake which for anyone who knows about this in japan

1031
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:07,540
it was a panzer dragoon rpg um but it's really hard to get your hands on however though for the

1032
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:12,900
sega ages collection there is a panzer dragoon collection and uh die hard which was a dynamite

1033
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:19,060
deka in japan um but however keep in mind these are sega ages these are meant to be

1034
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:29,500
cheap the Sega Aegis 2900 is named 2900 for 2900 yen as in really cheap I'm

1035
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:35,120
sorry 2500 my apologies so um don't expect them to be you know made uber

1036
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:40,180
pretty all gorgeous everything but they are supposed to be retouched looking

1037
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:44,740
better and so what should be a good thing because I really liked the dynamite

1038
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:50,880
Deca series and Panzer Dragon was really neat so should be fun all right I

1039
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,960
actually did find them up for a pre-order on a couple sites I like those

1040
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:00,840
Sega Ages games unlike some people so well Fantasy Star 2 was just released on

1041
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:05,440
the Sega Ages but we haven't seen the trend you know any translations for

1042
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,760
these come out yet we've been basically playing them when our we have a friend

1043
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:19,760
But the remakes are really nice, and of course I have the Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier remakes, which are really, really nice.

1044
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:27,760
So, I can vouch for these SEGA Ages collections. Quite a bit of these have been re-released.

1045
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,760
I also like that SEGA and Ages are, you know...

1046
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:37,960
not acronyms, but when you shuffle the words, the letters around.

1047
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,960
Anagrams?

1048
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:39,960
Anagrams.

1049
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:40,960
Thank you.

1050
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,960
You're welcome.

1051
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,960
Oh, you're so smart.

1052
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,960
I am.

1053
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:44,960
Is that how you get jobs with video game companies?

1054
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:45,960
Yes.

1055
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,960
You're a smart feller.

1056
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,960
All right.

1057
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,000
Loki, anything for us last minute wise?

1058
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,680
Yeah, the first thing I was going to mention is that the cheat device for Grand Theft Auto

1059
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,880
Liberty City Stories is finally 1.0 now, and they added a few things.

1060
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:09,880
Hover Cars, which is pretty cool, Gather Spell, which causes the objects on the screen to basically hover around some fixed gravity point or something like that and you can throw them at stuff.

1061
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:19,880
They have a full-size video recorder now, and also drivable RC toys, which is pretty neat, and the gangs no longer attack you.

1062
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:25,880
So, if you're interested in that, you can actually find that at maxbot.com slash GTA.

1063
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:34,880
And the other thing that I saw was Earthworm Jims coming to next-gen stuff, next-gen consoles, so that's kind of cool.

1064
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:40,880
And, well, that's pretty much it, lots of Oblivion sheets.

1065
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,880
So.

1066
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:49,880
Alright. Any other last minute stories? Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?

1067
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,880
Alright, Beeler?

1068
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,960
I don't have any really good fuzzy uh... last news story of the night so sorry to

1069
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,720
say so that brings us to the end of the show

1070
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,080
April Fool's Day kind of screwed everything up this week news wise so

1071
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,160
what can you do

1072
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,520
uh... anyway

1073
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,840
it's the end of the show and that's no joke

1074
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,440
let's go around and get everybody's final thought

1075
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:11,320
Mikol Tov thanks for joining us even if it was for only half the show

not be like Kingdom Hearts, okay? Hooray. Alright. Uh, Loki, your final thought?

1081
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,400
Um... Oh, did I let you have a final thought? I'm sorry. No. What is your

1082
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,400
final thought? Yes. Alright, Loki, what's your final thought? My final

1083
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:43,400
thought is, I may be buying a laptop this week.

1084
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,400
