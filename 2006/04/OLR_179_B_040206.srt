2
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:25,326
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're back here with Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 179, April the 2nd, 2006.

3
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:32,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, guys, we're coming off of April Fool's Day, so take everything you hear tonight with a grain of salt.

4
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:39,159
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that is the real deal, though, we have a special guest here joining us for Part B. Say hello, everybody, to OLR favorite Miklatov.

5
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:39,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

6
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:40,620
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing?

7
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:41,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fine.

8
00:00:42,302 --> 00:00:44,063
[SPEAKER_08]: And Miklatov, of course, works over at Konami.

9
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:44,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

10
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:46,903
[SPEAKER_08]: but due to NDAs can't really tell us anything.

11
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:47,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

12
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:49,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any good games coming out this year from Konami?

13
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:51,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

14
00:00:51,924 --> 00:00:52,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

15
00:00:52,764 --> 00:00:54,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I guess that's about all we can figure out.

16
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:55,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray!

17
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell us anything about sequels to popular franchises?

18
00:00:59,485 --> 00:00:59,806
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

19
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:00,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell us anything about Metal Gear 4?

20
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:01,286
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

21
00:01:01,306 --> 00:01:01,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

22
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:04,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So he'll be giving us one word answers all night long.

23
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:06,647
[SPEAKER_08]: He can tell you that it is coming out.

24
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:08,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

25
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's public information.

26
00:01:10,047 --> 00:01:10,947
[SPEAKER_08]: We've all seen the trailer.

27
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:11,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

28
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:14,448
[SPEAKER_08]: How's Beatmania?

29
00:01:15,063 --> 00:01:15,303
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

30
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:46,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe.

31
00:01:46,717 --> 00:01:47,198
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'm good?

32
00:01:48,278 --> 00:01:51,618
[SPEAKER_00]: If you eat your vegetables and clean your room and make your bed.

33
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:52,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try.

34
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Guitar Room Man Live to PSP.

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:05,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Our listing is being put up by several of the Japanese retailers for a PSP title called Guitar Room Man Live due out in Japan at the end of May.

36
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:09,842
[SPEAKER_00]: No details out, nothing official has been said about it.

37
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:12,263
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hint's there.

38
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:13,483
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.

39
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:17,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised we haven't seen a Parappa the Rapper game for PSP.

40
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:18,744
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good point as well.

41
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:21,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Why drag the system sales down further?

42
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:23,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Parappa's awesome, you shut up.

43
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:25,568
[SPEAKER_08]: I like him jammerlammy, I don't like Parappa.

44
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:37,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think maybe the success of Guitar Hero is causing people to go, of course, this is Japan now, not the US, but I would assume that if this comes out in Japan, we'd luck out and get it here in the US too.

45
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:39,115
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to bring out the Taiko no Tatsujin.

46
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:40,437
[SPEAKER_08]: for the PSP

47
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:03,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

48
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:29,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so I hope that really happens.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:41,588
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do hope so, and also I have to say that for the message board for where we found this, I do think that whoever posted this, Filler Bunny, has the best name ever.

50
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:51,674
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I'm really hoping that we see it because, I mean, the one problem with that though, for anyone who played Guitar Room Man is...

51
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:56,025
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:24,721
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting hung up on the stupid Parapara stage with the stupid Parapara UFO.

53
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that like the second stage?

54
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:26,663
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

55
00:04:26,723 --> 00:04:27,503
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that song.

56
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:28,304
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good.

57
00:04:28,344 --> 00:04:29,445
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like right at the end of it.

58
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:31,706
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not as good as the Eurobeat song that's in there, though.

59
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:33,047
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the Eurobeat song.

60
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:33,888
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the Eurobeat song.

61
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:34,208
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

62
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:35,128
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another song in there.

63
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:36,129
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's the one you're thinking of.

64
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,411
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's the Eurobeat stage with the Parapara UFO.

65
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:38,931
[SPEAKER_00]: My bad.

66
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:39,411
[SPEAKER_00]: My bad.

67
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:40,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Parapara Eurobeat.

68
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:41,875
[SPEAKER_06]: That's such a good song.

69
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:42,576
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it is.

70
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,039
[SPEAKER_06]: That game is so good.

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, another game that I think a lot more people are looking forward to, Loki, we might have some news on.

72
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:54,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

73
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:56,968
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot more fans of this one than Guitar of Adam.

74
00:04:56,988 --> 00:04:58,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to follow up on something we talked about.

75
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the Forerunner rumor?

76
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:02,132
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually was in Game Informer.

77
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:03,213
[SPEAKER_08]: That was that Halo thing, right?

78
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Halo 3.

79
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:08,377
[SPEAKER_07]: That whole article was in Game Informer and I actually got to read it.

80
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:13,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what source they're taking it from.

81
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:17,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's going to be what Halo 3 is.

82
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:24,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously they're going to call it Halo 3 or Halo 4 Runner or something like that, which will be Halo 3, like Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter type thing.

83
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:37,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so supposedly the word on the street is that IGN, once again their anonymous source, has found out that

84
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:40,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Halo 3 is supposed to be shipping March 2007.

85
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,472
[SPEAKER_08]: And the story is not dated April 1st?

86
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:46,554
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the story came out March 30th.

87
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:48,635
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it is close enough to that.

88
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:52,498
[SPEAKER_07]: But it sounds about right, time-wise.

89
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:54,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, yeah.

90
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:56,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't they want to save it for the holiday season?

91
00:05:57,221 --> 00:06:03,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it'll sell either way, but... You always pick your biggest things at the holiday season, I thought.

92
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:06,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Not if they think Sony or Nintendo is plotting something around the same time frame.

93
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:11,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they think that maybe that's when the PlayStation 3 is actually going to launch.

94
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:12,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

95
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:13,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

96
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:13,943
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

97
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:16,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm kind of surprised they wouldn't try to release it in time for Christmas.

98
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:18,624
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course, you know, something like Halo, you don't want to screw that up.

99
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:21,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, technically that is in time for Christmas.

100
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:22,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Just really early.

101
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:24,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Wrong year.

102
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:25,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Wrong year.

103
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:31,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember the rumors that Halo 3 was supposed to disrupt the Sony PlayStation 3 launch?

104
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:33,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't Gates say that or something?

105
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:33,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

106
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:36,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be very happy if everything's been kept under wraps.

107
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:38,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I think it has.

108
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you think that this is Microsoft's big thing at E3?

109
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:45,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they don't have a new system to show off this year.

110
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:46,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they've got to give us a big game.

111
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Or so we know.

112
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:48,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's true.

113
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,381
[SPEAKER_08]: They could have their portable that everybody's been rumoring about.

114
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:58,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Halo 3 is definitely going to be the thing that they kick off the focus of their announcements.

115
00:06:59,047 --> 00:06:59,688
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to be.

116
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:00,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

117
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:01,065
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

118
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:09,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's, what else are you going to do when PlayStation 3 will be like, oh, look how pretty everything is, and, you know, Nintendo's going to be, look how innovative everything is.

119
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:12,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft will be like, look, we have Halo 3.

120
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:13,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, so.

121
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:17,137
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fanboys go, yay!

122
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:23,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention, three more games have been added to the compatibility list.

123
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:25,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, really?

124
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:28,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Winning 11-9, so some soccer for you.

125
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:29,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Black,

126
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,145
[SPEAKER_07]: and... God damn it, I forgot the last one.

127
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:33,605
[SPEAKER_08]: That's alright.

128
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:41,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that whole, like, oh, Xbox 360's gonna be constantly updated with, you know, new backwards compat... Bullshit!

129
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:43,649
[SPEAKER_08]: We got three in the past couple months.

130
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:44,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah, sure.

131
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:46,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, interesting.

132
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:50,270
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just in time for their third relaunch of the system.

133
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,893
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can play Barbie, but I still can't play DDR.

134
00:07:54,253 --> 00:07:55,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Silent Hill.

135
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:57,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, speaking of which, you bring this up.

136
00:07:58,136 --> 00:08:04,681
[SPEAKER_08]: We touched on this in the first part of the show and I tried to kind of retell your experiences, but how was it at Best Buy this morning?

137
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:08,244
[SPEAKER_08]: How did you come to find out that they were going to be doing this sale and all that good stuff?

138
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:12,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have a relative who works at Best Buy and he informed me

139
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:18,671
[SPEAKER_06]: That Best Buy was doing yet another relaunch type deal of the Xbox 360.

140
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,632
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was very hush-hush apparently.

141
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:24,734
[SPEAKER_06]: When we got there, it was only like 8.30 and nobody was there.

142
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:28,335
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the time the place opened, there was about 10 people in line.

143
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had about, I think about 90 systems.

144
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:37,319
[SPEAKER_06]: And my first one was defective, kind of, in my own weird way.

145
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, I mean, I took it back right before they closed and they still had plenty of systems, so...

146
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:45,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the shortage over from what you saw?

147
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:48,715
[SPEAKER_06]: At that Best Buy, yeah.

148
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:55,221
[SPEAKER_06]: There was nobody in there today, but I assume it's getting better now, after today.

149
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:55,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, enjoy your 360.

150
00:08:56,923 --> 00:08:57,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

151
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:58,464
[SPEAKER_08]: The second one that you're on now.

152
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:00,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to see if it works still.

153
00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:01,627
[SPEAKER_08]: What games did you get?

154
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:02,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

155
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:06,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to tell us your gamer tags so all the DDR fanboys can start adding you?

156
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:08,957
[SPEAKER_06]: are you going to get Rumble Roses XX?

157
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:20,796
[SPEAKER_07]: no, because I worked on that game and I know it's not a good game wow see, that's the point though here's the point though I know I can get that game for free because Konami loves our company and they send us free stuff

158
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:27,856
[SPEAKER_07]: and usually the people that work with me don't like the Konami stuff because they aren't into music games and stuff.

159
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:29,437
[SPEAKER_07]: And no one has a 360.

160
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:36,162
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking forward to getting Rumble Roses for free because I'm not buying the game.

161
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:38,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't play Dead or Alive 4.

162
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:41,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought, oh, I've got to get this game because it's a really good fighting game.

163
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:42,347
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't like it.

164
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:45,790
[SPEAKER_07]: But it looked fun because at least they're

165
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Nippalicious, I don't know.

166
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:56,163
[SPEAKER_06]: The good thing about Rumble Rose's XX is that it has really nice lighting and sometimes good graphics.

167
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:57,424
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

168
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make the most offensive looking character to play online.

169
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Miklatov, you're lying because you told me yourself the photo mode was awesome.

170
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, photo mode.

171
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:13,398
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a dirty, dirty pervert, which I am, it is really good for you because you can take

172
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:36,969
[SPEAKER_06]: really really bad pictures and share them with your friends when we were testing it I guess some reviewers in Mexico had already gotten it I don't know why Mexico has systems but like they had pictures for us to download and I swear I haven't seen things that bad in a long time wow

173
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:47,565
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, any interest in taking dirty photos on Rumble Roses XX and sending them to all your friends?

174
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:48,726
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

175
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,048
[SPEAKER_07]: That sure beats seeing the spam.

176
00:10:52,088 --> 00:10:54,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out my burnout clip.

177
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I so wish things had worked out so you could have gone to... Wait a second.

178
00:10:58,072 --> 00:11:00,874
[SPEAKER_07]: So what you're saying is you can actually spread those clips online?

179
00:11:01,054 --> 00:11:01,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

180
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:03,155
[SPEAKER_06]: You can download them.

181
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:07,718
[SPEAKER_06]: They have this place where you can just download photos that people have uploaded.

182
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:10,420
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can do whatever you want with them.

183
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, can you download them if you don't have the game?

184
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:16,413
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because it's like an option in the game.

185
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:19,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, damn, because we could have a totally awesome contest.

186
00:11:20,175 --> 00:11:23,256
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Rubber Roses XX, Dirty Photo Contest.

187
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:24,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Who can make the dirtiest photo?

188
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,678
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also put outlines around your pictures.

189
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:31,940
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we were testing it, we had two of the chicks really close to each other, and we put a heart around it.

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,821
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty funny and cute.

191
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:36,162
[SPEAKER_06]: But that game is worthless.

192
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:38,643
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so confusing and not fun.

193
00:11:40,464 --> 00:11:41,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

194
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:44,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the actual game.

195
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:44,912
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

196
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:46,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

197
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about some other news.

198
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:50,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you guys remember the whole Flowers for Jack?

199
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:51,736
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like weeks ago.

200
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:52,736
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually gave money to that.

201
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:56,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now it turned into this whole other thing that Pixelante is now what they're calling themselves.

202
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:58,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're selling shirts now.

203
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,301
[SPEAKER_08]: And Game Politics ran a story on this earlier in the week.

204
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:03,343
[SPEAKER_08]: They are selling their T-shirts.

205
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:09,266
[SPEAKER_08]: They are able to be purchased now on Zazzle, which I think is a competitor to Cafe E-Press or whatever that is.

206
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,886
[SPEAKER_08]: So Zazzle sells this now.

207
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:14,449
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see it at Zazzle.com slash Pixelanti Charity.

208
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,331
[SPEAKER_08]: And the shirts are around $15.

209
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:17,872
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the part.

210
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:30,523
[SPEAKER_08]: For every sociopath with a mouse, as Jack Thompson calls it, for everyone that buys one of these shirts, Game Politics is going to donate all the profits to the Get Well Gamers Foundation.

211
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:31,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to rub it.

212
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:33,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Jack Thompson's head on a donkey and making a jackass shirt.

213
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:04,444
[SPEAKER_00]: because actually he couldn't say it was harassment because it's legal under parity.

214
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:06,686
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

215
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:11,210
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's go over now to DarkSakura.

216
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:16,235
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura likes to surf the interweb, and she combs it up and down.

217
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:17,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Day in, day out.

218
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:26,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And she finds at work, and she finds that one website special enough to share with you kids in a little segment we call DarkSakura's Website of the Week, correct?

219
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:26,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

220
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:39,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's website of the week is Kingdom Hearts Ultimania, which is one of my absolute favorite Kingdom Hearts sites for a long, long time.

221
00:13:40,265 --> 00:13:46,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does this place have stories on here, it has information about Final Mix, images, artwork, videos, audio.

222
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:47,386
[SPEAKER_00]: You name it.

223
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:49,427
[SPEAKER_00]: It has lyrics translated.

224
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:55,131
[SPEAKER_00]: They have it in the Kanji, Romanji, English, everything.

225
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:58,252
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really just an excellent site.

226
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:05,036
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get there by going to www.kh2.co.uk Very, very good site.

227
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:05,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent forums.

228
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:11,500
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really top notch as far as it's the place to go for Kingdom Hearts information.

229
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,762
[SPEAKER_08]: So all those fanboys and fangirls, somebody labeled it earlier?

230
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:17,923
[SPEAKER_08]: I usually try not to look at it.

231
00:14:17,943 --> 00:14:21,766
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't play the first game, but I read a lot of Slash thanks to my friends.

232
00:14:45,273 --> 00:14:50,480
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some very interesting Yaoi doujinshi posted a while back.

233
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting stuff.

234
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:55,726
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very disturbing because they're children.

235
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:57,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, why am I looking at this?

236
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,372
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what was better about the Slash than the first game?

237
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:01,694
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a better camera.

238
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:06,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that was a Kingdom Hearts joke.

239
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:06,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

240
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:07,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was.

241
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:07,895
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

242
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:16,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, speaking of trashy things, are kids able to still pick them up, those trashy, trashy games, the evil games that Jack Thompson says we play?

243
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:30,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the Federal Trade Commission released some results of their nationwide undercover sting operation, I guess, of electronic and video game stores.

244
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:34,257
[SPEAKER_07]: They're basically checking to see if people are still

245
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:37,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Selling these games to minors.

246
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,882
[SPEAKER_07]: And, well, actually they found that it's been a decrease.

247
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:55,010
[SPEAKER_07]: According to the survey here, 42% of the secret shoppers, children between the ages of 13 and 16 who attempted to buy an M-rated video game without a parent were able to make a purchase.

248
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:58,392
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it says in 2003, the...

249
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:06,187
[SPEAKER_07]: The percentage was 69%, so it's actually gone down quite a bit.

250
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:18,714
[SPEAKER_07]: And it says now there's more stricter sales of M-rated games and only about 35% of secret shoppers were able to purchase them now.

251
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:23,677
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you 35% is still kind of a high number for this stuff, you know?

252
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:26,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I just feel like we're still going to not hear the end of this.

253
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,541
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no actual laws in place for this in most states.

254
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,671
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no real laws for this.

255
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:36,692
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, it's just a recommendation.

256
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:48,717
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's all company enforced, so if 35% is down, that's actually pretty awesome that a company can enforce their will upon their employees to make sure that they check for ID and stuff like that.

257
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:50,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

258
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,991
[SPEAKER_08]: The Exception Rather Than The Rule

259
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:24,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Universal Studios, one executive over there was quoted saying, sales are near zilch, it's another Sony bomb.

260
00:17:26,055 --> 00:17:27,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, burn.

261
00:17:28,316 --> 00:17:30,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Has anybody actually tried to watch a UMD movie?

262
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:31,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's not fun.

263
00:17:31,237 --> 00:17:31,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.

264
00:17:31,537 --> 00:17:32,178
[SPEAKER_00]: I did on the plane.

265
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I did on a plane, too.

266
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:33,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, too.

267
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:37,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to watch Spider-Man 2 because it came with my system and it was not fun to watch.

268
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,260
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched Hellboy.

269
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw Tron.

270
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was fine.

271
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:43,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Tron looked pretty hot.

272
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:47,256
[SPEAKER_08]: They have nice, those PSPs have nice screens.

273
00:17:47,576 --> 00:17:55,642
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is those movies are 20-something dollars, in some cases more expensive than what they are on DVD, and I can't play those on my DVD player.

274
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:57,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And you don't get the bonus features for the most part.

275
00:17:58,084 --> 00:17:59,385
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, and that's the problem.

276
00:17:59,985 --> 00:18:06,310
[SPEAKER_08]: So the format, it was a good idea at first, I think, but I think the problem is there's no...

277
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:15,012
[SPEAKER_08]: If there were players that supported UMD, hell, even if they would announce that the PlayStation 3 would support the UMDs, which, what, you just pointed, what, Loki?

278
00:18:15,932 --> 00:18:25,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I thought that was one of the things they were going to announce at E3, is that there will be some sort of way to play UMD movies on TVs.

279
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:27,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's maybe too late.

280
00:18:28,836 --> 00:18:29,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's stupid.

281
00:18:29,696 --> 00:18:32,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, okay, good, you can play a UMD movie on TV.

282
00:18:33,297 --> 00:18:35,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, why do I have to buy a UMD movie over a DVD then?

283
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:37,114
[SPEAKER_07]: On Occasion

284
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,162
[SPEAKER_00]: My FU of the week would have to go toward Mountain Mike's Pizza.

285
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:22,785
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very nice of my boss to buy our team pizza, and she was very thoughtful to get vegetarian pizza.

286
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:26,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Except that I reacted to this vegetarian pizza the way that I react to meat.

287
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:32,329
[SPEAKER_00]: My stomach hurt like I had been doing a bajillion crunches, and yet I felt very full.

288
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,110
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt this way until yesterday morning.

289
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,732
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big FU goes to Mountain Mike's Pizza for trying to poison me.

290
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:42,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki!

291
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:50,068
[SPEAKER_07]: My FU goes to Best Buy and the stupid person they have working in their camera department in their Citrusite store.

292
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:52,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Guy was an idiot.

293
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked him questions.

294
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:59,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I was buying a video camera yesterday and I asked him, okay, what's the difference between this camera and this other camera?

295
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,271
[SPEAKER_07]: That was newer!

296
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:02,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, that didn't tell me anything, you dumbass.

297
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell that by looking at it.

298
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:04,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

299
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:06,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Completely useless.

300
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:12,557
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I did find a camera after having to drive a half an hour to the Elk Grove store, so that sucked.

301
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,519
[SPEAKER_07]: That and stupid drivers.

302
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:20,304
[SPEAKER_08]: My FU goes to male PMS because I think I've had that all weekend.

303
00:20:20,324 --> 00:20:23,806
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you can't tell during the show because I'm my peppy self, but I've had male PMS.

304
00:20:23,886 --> 00:20:25,486
[SPEAKER_08]: It sucks.

305
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:32,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not having woman issues, but you know that whole study that shows that men get that chemical imbalance that makes them all moody too once every so often?

306
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,831
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I have that this weekend.

307
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:38,552
[SPEAKER_08]: So be careful around me.

308
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:40,193
[SPEAKER_08]: In my brain, in my head, yes.

309
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,555
[SPEAKER_08]: The area between... Never mind, I'm not going to go there.

310
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:46,546
[SPEAKER_08]: The other area is just fine.

311
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:48,386
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my brain.

312
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:55,429
[SPEAKER_08]: As many people throw their iPods out the car window in horror at that thought.

313
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:57,310
[SPEAKER_08]: And they won't be missed.

314
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:58,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

315
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Miklatov, do you have a nephew of the week you'd like to get?

316
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:01,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

317
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:12,005
[SPEAKER_06]: LightLikeLoki, MyFUGoesToTheBestBuy, Citrus Heights, for treating me like a criminal for wanting to take back my 360 today because I had issues with it.

318
00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:22,694
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we were walking my new one over to the counter so they could kind of fake ring me up to swap it out, the guy from Meteor was like, there's another person taking back their 360?

319
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:24,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they not know how to work it or something?

320
00:21:25,176 --> 00:21:25,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to punch him.

321
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:30,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And preemptive FU to Microsoft because I have a feeling this one will be broken too.

322
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:33,154
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Poo Eater is so winner in the chatroom.

323
00:21:33,174 --> 00:21:33,934
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, I get PMS every month.

324
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:34,735
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a man, he's a mini.

325
00:21:34,775 --> 00:21:36,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I get PMS every month.

326
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:37,457
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the day after my wife's PMS.

327
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:03,757
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a joke.

328
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:05,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha.

329
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:08,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha.

330
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:09,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha.

331
00:22:09,638 --> 00:22:12,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't it be the same day because she's bugging him?

332
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:17,740
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but he's so exhausted after helping her.

333
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget it.

334
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Men have no idea what PMS is like.

335
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,141
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no way of knowing what PMS is like.

336
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:26,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

337
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:30,582
[SPEAKER_00]: The day that you grow a uterus and it decides to... With the exception of the

338
00:22:31,503 --> 00:22:36,145
[SPEAKER_08]: You know the birds and bees part that you learned about in fourth grade and the biological element of it all.

339
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:37,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

340
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:42,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Some days I get pretty grumpy and irritable.

341
00:22:44,168 --> 00:22:46,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I do know that... Ask my loved ones.

342
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:48,209
[SPEAKER_08]: And I crave junk food, too.

343
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:49,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I go through the whole motions.

344
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,631
[SPEAKER_08]: It's short of the physical aspect of that.

345
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:56,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, sorry.

346
00:22:57,673 --> 00:23:00,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, please bring this back to games.

347
00:23:00,694 --> 00:23:00,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't die.

348
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:09,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, there's actually been a recall on the Pelican Power Brick Battery Charger.

349
00:23:11,272 --> 00:23:16,313
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically this giant brick that you attach to your PSP that gives it more battery life.

350
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:24,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, there's a little problem with it being that, well, it overheats and has actually caused fire damage.

351
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:27,756
[SPEAKER_07]: According to the website...

352
00:23:31,098 --> 00:23:32,338
[SPEAKER_08]: might be dangerous.

353
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:44,761
[SPEAKER_07]: According to the website powerbrickrecall.net, there has actually been 143 reports of the recalled battery charger overheating, including one report of fire damage.

354
00:23:45,422 --> 00:23:46,922
[SPEAKER_07]: No injuries have been reported.

355
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:58,685
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, what you need to do, and they give you some information of hotlines to call, you need to send it back, is

356
00:23:59,636 --> 00:24:01,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, there's better batteries out there, to be honest.

357
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,224
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

358
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:07,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, yeah.

359
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:13,259
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't buy these battery accessories, you know, for your PSP, because, to be honest, it lasts long enough as it is.

360
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:15,064
[SPEAKER_07]: GameTap

361
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:37,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Trek and Bonsai?

362
00:24:56,469 --> 00:24:59,253
[SPEAKER_08]: and presented by people that seem to actually enjoy games.

363
00:24:59,493 --> 00:25:00,775
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something unreal there.

364
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:11,928
[SPEAKER_08]: So, GameTap, by the way, has also added, I guess, Neo Geo stuff now, because I checked out Baseball Stars, and then they also have Darkstalkers, so that means Capcom's on their way in, too.

365
00:25:11,948 --> 00:25:12,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

366
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:17,030
[SPEAKER_08]: and I heard some rumor they're doing a big Street Fighter thing, so I just thought I'd drop that out there.

367
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:19,151
[SPEAKER_08]: But what's interesting, oh, they also lowered their price.

368
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,092
[SPEAKER_08]: GameTap's now only, I think, $9.95 a month.

369
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:24,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hate to sound like a marketing thing, because really, you know, GameTap has its issues.

370
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:25,993
[SPEAKER_08]: They still need multiplayer.

371
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:27,754
[SPEAKER_08]: That would really help them sell their things.

372
00:25:28,274 --> 00:25:32,755
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think it's a really just neat concept idea, and I hope it's successful.

373
00:25:33,035 --> 00:25:36,977
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of people are saying it's doom and gloom, because, oh, price cut means they've got to move things.

374
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,677
[SPEAKER_08]: But not necessarily.

375
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:41,438
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be just an incentive to get more people on, you know?

376
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:43,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe $15 is a little too high.

377
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,351
[SPEAKER_08]: People might go for $10.

378
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:45,532
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

379
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,414
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki.

380
00:25:47,994 --> 00:25:51,497
[SPEAKER_08]: One game you can play on GameTap is Tomb Raider, but the old ones.

381
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:52,658
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a new one coming, right?

382
00:25:53,018 --> 00:26:00,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, Tomb Raider Legend right now is coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and PSP in May.

383
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:05,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the only thing it isn't coming out on is the Nintendo systems.

384
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:08,231
[SPEAKER_07]: No GameCube, no Nintendo DS.

385
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:09,532
[SPEAKER_07]: However...

386
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:12,647
[SPEAKER_07]: It's possibly coming out later this year for them.

387
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:36,573
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently, once again from IGN, they have talked to Eidos, and apparently Bill Gardner, the Eidos North America CEO and president, basically said, Laura likes Reggie, referring to Reggie over at Nintendo of America.

388
00:26:36,753 --> 00:26:38,014
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically...

389
00:26:40,011 --> 00:26:46,693
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're talking about it being released later on, possibly, I don't know, probably the end of the summer would be my guess.

390
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:53,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the only thing, though, this was announced kind of around April Fool's, so we don't know.

391
00:26:54,836 --> 00:27:00,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally, I don't think it's gonna, because the GameCube's not really a big system right now as far as releases go.

392
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:09,521
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like maybe two a month, and the DS, well, you know, it's pretty good, but I don't see being able to port this very well over the DS, so...

393
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna call bullshit on this story, to be honest.

394
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:16,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's coming out on the GameCube or any Nintendo system anytime soon.

395
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's my thought.

396
00:27:19,332 --> 00:27:19,713
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

397
00:27:21,956 --> 00:27:23,418
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the problem with April Fool's Day.

398
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:24,659
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, you don't know what to believe.

399
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:25,941
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, the GameCube...

400
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:32,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the fact that a lot of people still own one and there isn't a lot of games coming out for it is an incentive to put this game out on GameCube.

401
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:33,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

402
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:36,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it'd be a waste of money.

403
00:27:36,941 --> 00:27:45,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, of course, we all know one of the incentives to getting a revolution is going to be the backwards compatibility with not only Nintendo products, but Sega and TurboGrafx as well.

404
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:48,827
[SPEAKER_08]: And we think we might know some of the games coming, possibly?

405
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:51,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there was a wish list that was posted.

406
00:27:53,028 --> 00:27:56,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Game Daily had an article up where they put up a wish list of games.

407
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:04,471
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were some of the ones that made the list, which are actually all games that I own except for one, which is the last one on the list.

408
00:28:06,092 --> 00:28:06,312
[SPEAKER_00]: But...

409
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,820
[SPEAKER_00]: BUNKS ADVENTURE, BUNKS REVENGE

410
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:46,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Dracula X, Rondo of Blood, Splatterhouse, and Air Zonk.

411
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so what we have to do now to follow that up is we have to make a wish list of our own.

412
00:28:52,926 --> 00:28:54,868
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know there's only one way we can do that, right?

413
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:59,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to be including the games that were already on this list if we'd really like to see them?

414
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:03,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so because those are all the really good TurboGrafx ones.

415
00:29:03,891 --> 00:29:06,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to let those on the list because I have one I want to use.

416
00:29:06,874 --> 00:29:14,302
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, the way we do it around here, if you've never heard it before, the way we make lists is through a little segment we call ListList.

417
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:17,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

418
00:29:40,407 --> 00:29:41,147
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a given.

419
00:29:41,507 --> 00:29:42,708
[SPEAKER_08]: So we got to think outside the box.

420
00:29:42,728 --> 00:29:46,788
[SPEAKER_08]: So games we most want to see on the revolution besides Sonic from Sega and NEC.

421
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:50,689
[SPEAKER_08]: So the way it works, you guys, we're going to go around and give our top three.

422
00:29:50,729 --> 00:29:53,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and our guest Miklatov will give our top three.

423
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the fun part comes.

424
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,611
[SPEAKER_08]: We take one off of the list, each of us.

425
00:29:58,111 --> 00:30:00,551
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you guys, the chat room, get the final say.

426
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,572
[SPEAKER_08]: You get two votes, so number one and number two.

427
00:30:03,312 --> 00:30:06,333
[SPEAKER_08]: and what you think should be on the wish list.

428
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:10,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe we'll send this wish list to Nintendo and Sega and NEC somehow.

429
00:30:11,255 --> 00:30:14,977
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll look in our little black book and see if we have some addresses we can send this to.

430
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:18,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so here we go.

431
00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:19,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Who wants to start us off tonight?

432
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:20,479
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, you want to start us off?

433
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:20,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

434
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:24,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what is your number three pick for Sega or NEC game you most want?

435
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,941
[SPEAKER_00]: I am making a disclaimer.

436
00:30:26,941 --> 00:30:31,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of the games I would really like to see on there, I'm not going to list because nobody's heard of them, like Emerald Dragon and Sapphire.

437
00:30:33,052 --> 00:30:33,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.

438
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:35,754
[SPEAKER_00]: But I suggest people give them a try if they can.

439
00:30:35,915 --> 00:30:36,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

440
00:30:36,395 --> 00:30:40,519
[SPEAKER_00]: So my number three is Star Parodia, which also probably only a handful of people have heard of.

441
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:51,068
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's a shooting game featuring a flying bomber man, a flying PC engine, and, um, let's see, what was the other thing in there?

442
00:30:51,088 --> 00:30:53,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was three different flying machines.

443
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, oh yeah, and, uh, a, uh, super deformed Vic Viper.

444
00:30:59,636 --> 00:31:00,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh,

445
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:08,339
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this cute little game, like if you play as the PC Engine, which I always did, you could shoot out CDs and cue cards as your firepower.

446
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:09,419
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really cute.

447
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, very cool.

448
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what's your number three?

449
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:16,643
[SPEAKER_07]: My number three, I would have to say Splatterhouse.

450
00:31:16,663 --> 00:31:19,124
[SPEAKER_07]: That game's fun.

451
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:25,127
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta love a game that kind of mocks Friday the 13th and has a guy that's main weapon is a 2x4.

452
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Miklatov, your number three pick.

453
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:29,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a disclaimer too.

454
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:31,937
[SPEAKER_06]: All my games are really random.

455
00:31:32,177 --> 00:31:32,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

456
00:31:33,118 --> 00:31:38,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So my number three would be Panic, because that game was awesome and very scary when I was little.

457
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,684
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on the Sega CD.

458
00:31:40,085 --> 00:31:41,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god!

459
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:45,470
[SPEAKER_08]: At first I thought I'd never heard of this game, and now, oh my god, I have heard of Panic.

460
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:52,537
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that little kid, and you push buttons and things, and you go to another room, and you get taken places, and it's scary, but I loved it.

461
00:31:52,718 --> 00:31:53,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, sounds good.

462
00:31:54,139 --> 00:31:55,700
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what's your number two pick?

463
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:55,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Popful Mail

464
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Working Designs brought it out in the U.S.

465
00:32:19,561 --> 00:32:21,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Really fun, cute little translation.

466
00:32:21,662 --> 00:32:24,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very hard to get your hands on a copy of this now.

467
00:32:25,063 --> 00:32:27,624
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a little side-scrolling adventure RPG.

468
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I've never heard of this game, I have to admit.

469
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:31,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I spell it right there?

470
00:32:31,465 --> 00:32:31,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Popful?

471
00:32:32,246 --> 00:32:35,787
[SPEAKER_00]: P-O-P-F-U-L, and then mail as in, you got mail.

472
00:32:36,061 --> 00:32:36,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, cool.

473
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:43,282
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's such a cute little game, and I'll bring over my Sega CD one day so you can see this game.

474
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:44,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd have to see this.

475
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:46,843
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was one of the Working Designs projects back in the day.

476
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:51,284
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know the types of games that Working Designs brings us.

477
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your number two.

478
00:32:53,704 --> 00:32:54,444
[SPEAKER_07]: My number two.

479
00:32:54,464 --> 00:32:58,705
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was kind of a fun game.

480
00:32:58,925 --> 00:33:00,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Shadow Dancer.

481
00:33:03,186 --> 00:33:04,846
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the best Shinobi games.

482
00:33:05,305 --> 00:33:06,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Shadow Dancer was excellent.

483
00:33:17,685 --> 00:33:18,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Smooth Criminal.

484
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,966
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to throw your hat.

485
00:33:21,707 --> 00:33:26,349
[SPEAKER_08]: My number two would be one of the greatest and most overlooked Sega CD games of all time.

486
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:37,013
[SPEAKER_08]: And remember that this is, and we don't even know if Sega CD games are going to end up on Nintendo Revolution, but just the whole idea of seeing this on the Revolution would make me giggle in places I didn't even know I had.

487
00:33:37,694 --> 00:33:40,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Night Trap is my number two pick.

488
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:42,055
[SPEAKER_00]: It had What's-Her-Face in it.

489
00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:42,856
[SPEAKER_00]: With Dana Plato.

490
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:43,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

491
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:47,659
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

492
00:34:11,155 --> 00:34:11,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Road Rash Road Rash

493
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:38,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but not next gen.

494
00:34:39,003 --> 00:34:42,745
[SPEAKER_07]: There hasn't been anything since, like, um... There was one on PlayStation.

495
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:47,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the original PlayStation, maybe... There was one on 3DO.

496
00:34:48,247 --> 00:34:49,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember the 3DO one.

497
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:51,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what was Road Rash all about?

498
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:52,950
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember the name, but I don't remember the game.

499
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:56,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Road Rash is, it's basically motorcycle racing and combat.

500
00:34:56,151 --> 00:35:00,073
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're, you know, riding motorcycles and hitting people with chains and baseball bats and stuff.

501
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:00,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh!

502
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:01,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the Final Fantasy 7.

503
00:35:02,014 --> 00:35:03,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I have played that game before.

504
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:04,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, sounds good.

505
00:35:05,852 --> 00:35:12,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, our chat room says, GK128 says, Road Rash was E3, but there was one on PS2 that was canned.

506
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:14,434
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess they started to do one and didn't.

507
00:35:15,434 --> 00:35:17,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Mikotov, your number one pick.

508
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:21,336
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a game nobody will know, so it should get kicked off right away.

509
00:35:21,576 --> 00:35:22,416
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Zoom.

510
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:24,436
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on Genesis, you know that?

511
00:35:24,596 --> 00:35:25,456
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Zoom.

512
00:35:25,476 --> 00:35:26,597
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was so awesome.

513
00:35:26,637 --> 00:35:27,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that a puzzle game?

514
00:35:27,797 --> 00:35:28,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

515
00:35:28,077 --> 00:35:29,077
[SPEAKER_06]: That game sucked.

516
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:30,237
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that game was sweet.

517
00:35:30,257 --> 00:35:31,258
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was awful.

518
00:35:31,278 --> 00:35:32,698
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an MTV game, wasn't it?

519
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:32,878
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

520
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:33,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I think it was.

521
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:35,299
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're thinking Zoop.

522
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:36,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I am thinking of Zoop.

523
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,741
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is also a puzzle game.

524
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:39,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

525
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:45,544
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like this pig head thing with legs and you drew squares and you had to watch out for the scrubbing bubbles things.

526
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:47,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that sounds kind of cool.

527
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:48,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking of Zoop.

528
00:35:48,686 --> 00:35:49,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Zoop.

529
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:49,846
[SPEAKER_06]: You're thinking Zoop.

530
00:35:49,867 --> 00:35:50,547
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was awful.

531
00:35:50,707 --> 00:35:54,609
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is like really old first generation Genesis game.

532
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:56,330
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so I get the last say.

533
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one pick.

534
00:35:58,311 --> 00:36:00,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really tempted to do ToeJam & Earl.

535
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:02,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, chat room, because chat room is yelling out ToeJam & Earl.

536
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,994
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have to do this for the simple irony.

537
00:36:05,134 --> 00:36:15,900
[SPEAKER_08]: If you were a kid when this whole thing went down, you would know why I have to say Mortal Kombat, the Genesis version, has to be on the Nintendo Revolution.

538
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,222
[SPEAKER_08]: So Nintendo finally gets some Mortal Kombat with blood in it and not sweat.

539
00:36:20,582 --> 00:36:22,504
[SPEAKER_08]: And really small characters.

540
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:23,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

541
00:36:24,304 --> 00:36:25,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonder Boy in Monster Land

542
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here's the list as it stands right now.

543
00:36:55,924 --> 00:37:09,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Parodia, Splatterhouse, Panic, Devil's Crush, Popful Mail, Shadow Dancer, Moonwalker, Night Trap, Dracula X, Rondo of Blood, Road Rash, Zoom, and Mortal Kombat.

544
00:37:09,572 --> 00:37:12,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Boy, this was way more random than I thought it would be.

545
00:37:12,574 --> 00:37:13,194
[SPEAKER_08]: We're weird.

546
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:14,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, but here it is.

547
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:17,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the part to get rid of the most weird stuff.

548
00:37:17,557 --> 00:37:20,538
[SPEAKER_08]: We eliminate one pick before we let the chatroom vote.

549
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,880
[SPEAKER_08]: So, DarkSakura, what's coming off the list?

550
00:37:24,118 --> 00:37:24,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Trap.

551
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:26,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Aw, you're no fun.

552
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Dan and I tried to play through that game and it was so stupid.

553
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,521
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's slumber parties and Dana Plato and zombies.

554
00:37:36,081 --> 00:37:40,202
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I wanted to watch stupid, I could watch the Toxic Avenger movies.

555
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:42,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what's coming off this list?

556
00:37:42,943 --> 00:37:45,224
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I should have put Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

557
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

558
00:37:47,576 --> 00:37:48,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Nintendo 2

559
00:38:13,243 --> 00:38:15,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would have won.

560
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:17,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe I didn't say Bomberman either.

561
00:38:17,924 --> 00:38:20,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, nobody said Bomberman, stupids.

562
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:22,246
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had Bomberman on Super Nintendo.

563
00:38:22,486 --> 00:38:22,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's true.

564
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,547
[SPEAKER_06]: It was completely different on Genesis, though.

565
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:25,907
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

566
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:27,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, 64 is pretty fun.

567
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:28,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

568
00:38:28,248 --> 00:38:29,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, I want to take it off.

569
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:32,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Matt didn't have one taken off, so I'm going to be fair.

570
00:38:32,129 --> 00:38:36,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to take off... I don't know.

571
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:41,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to take...

572
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:44,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy VII Skitchin

573
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,431
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, here it is.

574
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:03,952
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys can vote for your favorites in chat room right now.

575
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:13,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Parodia, Splatterhouse, Panic, Devil's Crush, Popful Mail, Shadow Dancer, Moonwalker, and Mortal Kombat.

576
00:39:14,336 --> 00:39:20,238
[SPEAKER_08]: So send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your number one and your number two picks.

577
00:39:20,618 --> 00:39:23,399
[SPEAKER_08]: and we'll let you know at the end of the show who the winners are.

578
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,060
[SPEAKER_08]: And boy did we end up weird.

579
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,201
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a really weird list.

580
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:31,343
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of wish though now that I put Emerald Dragon on there because Emerald Dragon was such a good game.

581
00:39:31,363 --> 00:39:31,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

582
00:39:31,623 --> 00:39:39,726
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish that they would say, let's bring Saturn games on because then I could say, you know, freaking Black Matrix because that game will never come out over here.

583
00:39:41,027 --> 00:39:47,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, though, even though our list is really random, I think that's a good thing because we're thinking of titles that a lot of people sometimes don't think of right away when they think of Sega Genesis.

584
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:49,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, everybody thinks of Sonic.

585
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,690
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I think this is good.

586
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:59,373
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also some pretty, you know, there were pretty mainstream games on there because Devil's Crush and Shadow Dancer, those were really popular.

587
00:40:01,974 --> 00:40:08,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember just sitting in the same room watching Dan play through Shadow Dancer and I was like, yeah, this game's awesome because you have a dog.

588
00:40:09,713 --> 00:40:11,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's why I couldn't take it off the list.

589
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:11,822
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too good.

590
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,042
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura is the administrator of our mailbag.

591
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:28,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you guys send your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, she puts on the rubber gloves, because you never know what people send us, and gets in the mailbag and pulls out some letters and reads them for us every week.

592
00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:31,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes my hands get some spam on them, too.

593
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:36,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you're adding Orange Lounge Radio a spam email, just freaking stop.

594
00:40:37,113 --> 00:40:37,614
[SPEAKER_08]: It's annoying.

595
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:39,034
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hunt you down.

596
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:39,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll kill you.

597
00:40:40,335 --> 00:40:41,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheese grater, lemon juice.

598
00:40:41,957 --> 00:40:44,378
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, who's in the mailbag this week?

599
00:40:46,178 --> 00:41:00,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I have email from, well, I guess, I think this is Sakurina, I think, but didn't sign it, about DDR Supernova.

600
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:07,092
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'll just go ahead and read the email.

601
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:08,713
[SPEAKER_00]: First things first, I played Supernova.

602
00:41:08,853 --> 00:41:09,613
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome.

603
00:41:09,673 --> 00:41:10,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed it.

604
00:41:10,713 --> 00:41:12,934
[SPEAKER_00]: The left pad was kind of sticky, but the music was awesome.

605
00:41:12,974 --> 00:41:14,794
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seduction Vocal Mix.

606
00:41:15,254 --> 00:41:16,935
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, it was really awesome and it looked nice.

607
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:18,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray!

608
00:41:20,776 --> 00:41:23,856
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is from TheOtherJamie, who spells the name differently.

609
00:41:24,617 --> 00:41:26,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the fun last year with the Mega Man effect?

610
00:41:26,977 --> 00:41:30,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Though it only could run on a Mac, they've ported it.

611
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:33,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the Mega Man effect thing.

612
00:41:33,944 --> 00:41:34,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that.

613
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:35,145
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

614
00:41:36,386 --> 00:41:38,307
[SPEAKER_08]: When you would boot up a... Check out the MySpace.

615
00:41:38,327 --> 00:41:39,728
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a clip from the show on there.

616
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,069
[SPEAKER_08]: MySpace.com.

617
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:43,171
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have time for MySpace.

618
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:43,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Too bad.

619
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:44,172
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

620
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,852
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I'm giving you.

621
00:41:45,953 --> 00:41:47,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerk.

622
00:41:47,554 --> 00:41:52,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Our dear friend Rob with two B's sent us an email about Sega Sammy.

623
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I would also like to say Rob with two B's has a higher gamer score than anybody on my Xbox friends list.

624
00:41:58,982 --> 00:41:59,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, my friend.

625
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:05,516
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually posted a bit of an article in here about Sega debuting a new headquarters.

626
00:42:05,837 --> 00:42:06,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega Amusements, the U.S.

627
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:12,862
[SPEAKER_00]: game factory that has emerged from the merger of Japanese game giant Sega Corp.

628
00:42:12,902 --> 00:42:24,991
[SPEAKER_00]: and the equally powerful Sammy Corporation, have held a grand opening recently for their new 77,000 square foot sales development and game and prize warehouse facility in the Chicago suburb of Elk Grove Village.

629
00:42:26,432 --> 00:42:30,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Special guests at the event included Sega Sammy Holdings CEO Hajime Satome,

630
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:40,408
[SPEAKER_00]: who engineered the merger and oversees the combined companies in Japan as well as local dignitaries such as Mayor Craig Johnson.

631
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:45,633
[SPEAKER_00]: The combination has dramatically enhanced the company's capabilities, said Satomi through an interpreter.

632
00:42:46,054 --> 00:42:50,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look around at what we have to offer and then think about what Sega can do in the future.

633
00:42:51,379 --> 00:42:53,742
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's...

634
00:42:56,022 --> 00:42:56,582
[SPEAKER_00]: More Sega.

635
00:42:56,883 --> 00:42:57,403
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I say?

636
00:42:57,443 --> 00:42:58,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we'll see some good things come out of them.

637
00:42:59,384 --> 00:43:01,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see more freaking Planet Harrier.

638
00:43:04,008 --> 00:43:12,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we also got an email from someone whose gamertag is Ldriver but E-I-I-E.

639
00:43:12,994 --> 00:43:13,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

640
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:14,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Kill Bill.

641
00:43:14,915 --> 00:43:15,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

642
00:43:15,556 --> 00:43:15,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.

643
00:43:16,196 --> 00:43:17,477
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go ahead and read this email out.

644
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:21,681
[SPEAKER_00]: I found out about your site slash show about three weeks ago, and I've been listening ever since.

645
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:27,887
[SPEAKER_00]: You put out great content that's not only really funny and informative, but also socially responsible and different in relation to gaming.

646
00:43:28,308 --> 00:43:32,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to plug another podcast, but Gamertag Radio is also another place I hear similar topics.

647
00:43:32,732 --> 00:43:43,162
[SPEAKER_00]: As a 20-something working professional adult gay gamer, or gamer myself, I was really appreciative to the segments in your past two shows about how not all gamers are straight nerdy teenage boys.

648
00:43:43,786 --> 00:43:49,910
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys also happen to be darkly sarcastic about almost everything like me, so I find myself laughing out loud while listening to your show.

649
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:50,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Me?

650
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Sarcastic?

651
00:43:51,771 --> 00:43:52,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Never!

652
00:43:52,812 --> 00:43:55,914
[SPEAKER_00]: In places like my subway ride to work or at my desk.

653
00:43:56,614 --> 00:43:58,195
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one quick question for you three.

654
00:43:58,355 --> 00:44:00,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Who or what do you think will steal a show at E3?

655
00:44:00,477 --> 00:44:07,421
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally think PS3 is becoming overhyped, especially in the past few weeks, and that Microsoft and or Nintendo will use E3 to surprise everyone.

656
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:08,202
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?

657
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for putting out great shows and keep up the great work.

658
00:44:10,592 --> 00:44:16,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually got to see the videos from the Game Developers Conference, including all the wonderful PS3 in-game shots.

659
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:18,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, does it look nice.

660
00:44:18,776 --> 00:44:20,157
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the revolution will be awesome.

661
00:44:21,757 --> 00:44:23,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to be information overload this year.

662
00:44:23,858 --> 00:44:26,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I think E3 is going to be so monumental in a way you've never imagined.

663
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think any one person can steal the show.

664
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:31,322
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody's going to be constantly one-upping each other the whole day.

665
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:39,606
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if anybody, I think Nintendo's got the biggest secret out there, and they stand to either really...

666
00:44:41,081 --> 00:44:41,861
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually my first launch E3.

667
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:44,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't count last year as a launch E3 because...

668
00:45:05,382 --> 00:45:05,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom!

669
00:45:05,722 --> 00:45:06,923
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see it.

670
00:45:35,836 --> 00:45:36,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I was able to pull up that program.

671
00:45:37,016 --> 00:45:38,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the Mega Man thing?

672
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:38,977
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty funny.

673
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:39,817
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

674
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:40,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefox.

675
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:40,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Cute.

676
00:46:05,249 --> 00:46:06,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, very cute.

677
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:10,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you better take that off the computer before Extrovert tries to go play World of Warcraft because he's going to go, what the fuck?

678
00:46:11,774 --> 00:46:15,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Too bad you can't do the little trick where you turn the stars into chickens.

679
00:46:17,178 --> 00:46:18,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Who remembers that?

680
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:18,859
[SPEAKER_08]: I do, I do.

681
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,680
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a cool hack.

682
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:20,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, any more email?

683
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:23,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there is more email, so huh.

684
00:46:23,523 --> 00:46:23,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

685
00:46:25,832 --> 00:46:30,274
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our listeners, Justin, has a question for us, and I'll read his letter.

686
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:34,075
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that Lemmings was out for the PSP, but only in the UK.

687
00:46:34,135 --> 00:46:38,957
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if the UK version will play on my US PSP, and if so, what is the best way to import this game?

688
00:46:39,057 --> 00:46:40,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work on the live show.

689
00:46:40,877 --> 00:46:42,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Is PSP region free?

690
00:46:42,178 --> 00:46:42,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

691
00:46:42,658 --> 00:46:43,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, PSP is region free.

692
00:46:43,998 --> 00:46:44,439
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

693
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:45,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Import away.

694
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:47,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Find whatever.

695
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:50,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check the Better Business Bureau before picking an importer.

696
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:51,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.

697
00:46:52,274 --> 00:46:53,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Never buy anything from BuyRite.

698
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:17,651
[SPEAKER_06]: or Toys and Joys.

699
00:47:17,932 --> 00:47:19,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Toys and Joys has given me nothing but good service.

700
00:47:20,074 --> 00:47:21,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

701
00:47:21,796 --> 00:47:22,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Jerks.

702
00:47:22,377 --> 00:47:31,489
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought my guitar controllers for Guitar Freaks from them for cheaper than anywhere else had them and they had just got their shipment in and packed it up that day.

703
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:32,910
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a phone order.

704
00:47:34,032 --> 00:47:35,674
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it within like a week.

705
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I've not shopped at any of those stores.

706
00:47:37,475 --> 00:47:43,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I've used a place in the past called Japan Video Games because I went to their actual store once and so I've been loyal ever since.

707
00:47:43,419 --> 00:47:46,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that's where I got my drum controller from.

708
00:47:46,521 --> 00:47:49,402
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we just sort of take the drive to Burlingame and go to Network.

709
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:51,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't Network closed?

710
00:47:51,484 --> 00:47:52,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't they just close recently?

711
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:53,605
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.

712
00:47:53,685 --> 00:47:55,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we were trying to go there the other day.

713
00:47:55,246 --> 00:47:56,447
[SPEAKER_00]: They are closed on a weird day.

714
00:47:56,467 --> 00:47:57,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're closed on Tuesday.

715
00:47:58,048 --> 00:47:58,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

716
00:47:58,788 --> 00:47:59,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we've got to go.

717
00:47:59,429 --> 00:47:59,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

718
00:47:59,809 --> 00:48:00,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

719
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:01,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

720
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:02,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Worldwide show, guys.

721
00:48:02,571 --> 00:48:03,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

722
00:48:03,752 --> 00:48:04,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, that was the last email.

723
00:48:05,072 --> 00:48:05,352
Okay.

724
00:48:05,772 --> 00:48:06,192
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, then.

725
00:48:06,513 --> 00:48:07,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Send us more email.

726
00:48:07,353 --> 00:48:08,053
[SPEAKER_08]: More, more, more.

727
00:48:08,393 --> 00:48:08,873
[SPEAKER_08]: We crave it.

728
00:48:09,013 --> 00:48:09,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag.

729
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,273
[SPEAKER_08]: OrangeOnTrader.com is where to send it.

730
00:48:12,074 --> 00:48:12,514
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

731
00:48:13,034 --> 00:48:17,314
[SPEAKER_08]: We will reveal the listless winner very soon.

732
00:48:17,354 --> 00:48:19,675
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we have a couple stories real quick for you guys.

733
00:48:19,695 --> 00:48:20,715
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a small announcement, though.

734
00:48:21,015 --> 00:48:21,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, what's this?

735
00:48:22,155 --> 00:48:24,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week, we will be rolling out a contest.

736
00:48:25,316 --> 00:48:25,776
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

737
00:48:26,276 --> 00:48:31,117
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to say anything about it, but make sure that you tell everyone to tune in next Sunday.

738
00:48:31,795 --> 00:48:37,280
[SPEAKER_00]: because also, of course, it's going to be repeated on our podcast, but the first details will be on our live show.

739
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,122
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're working with somebody else to do it.

740
00:48:39,242 --> 00:48:40,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's a big thing.

741
00:48:40,523 --> 00:48:40,803
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

742
00:48:41,524 --> 00:48:41,804
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

743
00:48:43,605 --> 00:48:45,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you got a story for us.

744
00:48:46,088 --> 00:48:47,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.

745
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:58,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, anyways, before I just play with all this stuff here, basically, we have information, and it's not really much of a surprise because we knew this was going to happen, but

746
00:49:00,163 --> 00:49:06,288
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be announcing DOA Extreme Beach 2 at E3.

747
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:12,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I'm not sure if it's going to be volleyball this time, because I heard basketball is another rumor they're going to do.

748
00:49:12,712 --> 00:49:19,698
[SPEAKER_07]: But basically, yes, the jiggly game will be shown at E3 or announced at E3.

749
00:49:19,738 --> 00:49:21,719
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hell yeah.

750
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:23,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

751
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:23,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

752
00:49:25,103 --> 00:49:28,607
[SPEAKER_08]: The Future of Credit Cards, earning virtual currency for spending in the real world.

753
00:49:43,903 --> 00:49:45,104
[SPEAKER_08]: and Otherworld Bridging.

754
00:49:45,344 --> 00:49:46,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to make this real quick.

755
00:49:46,664 --> 00:49:47,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to sum this up.

756
00:49:47,865 --> 00:49:54,489
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how sometimes credit cards give you rewards such as frequent flyer miles and things of that sort for every dollar that you spend?

757
00:49:54,929 --> 00:50:01,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now they're thinking of why not give in-game currency as a reward for spending money?

758
00:50:02,393 --> 00:50:07,675
[SPEAKER_00]: That would just screw up whatever currency, whatever economy you've got going on in that environment.

759
00:50:07,695 --> 00:50:12,678
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you use your credit card on in-game currency, you can score more in-game currency?

760
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:14,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Essentially.

761
00:50:15,377 --> 00:50:15,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

762
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,550
[SPEAKER_08]: So, just kind of interesting there.

763
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:19,670
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very lengthy blog.

764
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to read all the details there.

765
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:24,732
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to check it out for yourself, check out from March 2006, there was a blog there.

766
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:28,334
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just now, I mean, it's an old blog, but it's just now making the rounds on the gaming blogs.

767
00:50:28,914 --> 00:50:31,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Makezine.com is the name of the site there.

768
00:50:31,955 --> 00:50:33,396
[SPEAKER_08]: And they go into a lot of details there.

769
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:34,856
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's certainly an interesting idea.

770
00:50:34,936 --> 00:50:36,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, nobody's really thought of that before.

771
00:50:36,597 --> 00:50:43,100
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I don't know, most MMO hardcore players I know that might actually sign up for something like this also hate...

772
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,104
[SPEAKER_08]: GoldSellers and GilSellers or whatever the currency is in the game you're playing.

773
00:50:47,404 --> 00:50:52,910
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't see this working because I think there's a conflict of interest there, but whatever floats your boat.

774
00:50:55,673 --> 00:50:57,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Shall we reveal the winners of tonight's list list?

775
00:50:58,188 --> 00:50:59,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do.

776
00:51:27,549 --> 00:51:29,250
[SPEAKER_08]: of tonight's listless.

777
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:43,899
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, top three games we want to see on the Nintendo Revolution that is not Sonic from Sega or NEC from the TurboGrafx.

778
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,880
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of ties tonight.

779
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:52,504
[SPEAKER_08]: We have in third place, we have a tie there for third place, Star Parodia and Splatterhouse tied for third place.

780
00:51:53,115 --> 00:51:54,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job, everybody.

781
00:51:55,438 --> 00:51:56,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Second place, we have a tie.

782
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Shadow Dancer and Mortal Kombat tied for number two.

783
00:52:01,144 --> 00:52:01,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

784
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:05,008
[SPEAKER_08]: But the number one game they want to see?

785
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:07,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Moonwalker.

786
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:08,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I win.

787
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:09,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray.

788
00:52:10,554 --> 00:52:10,874
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

789
00:52:10,914 --> 00:52:11,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job, everybody.

790
00:52:12,015 --> 00:52:12,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for voting.

791
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,632
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll be sending that list to our round file.

792
00:52:15,712 --> 00:52:16,552
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just kidding.

793
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:18,774
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see what we can do about passing that along.

794
00:52:19,534 --> 00:52:22,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully we have some insider industry people that listen to the show.

795
00:52:23,457 --> 00:52:24,338
[SPEAKER_08]: You should email us.

796
00:52:25,118 --> 00:52:27,400
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd like to talk to you, get you on the show and interview you.

797
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,082
[SPEAKER_08]: We want some new faces and things on the show.

798
00:52:30,302 --> 00:52:31,583
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't had an interview in a while.

799
00:52:31,963 --> 00:52:36,346
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been trying to reach out to people, but everybody's like, wait till E3, wait till E3.

800
00:52:36,706 --> 00:52:37,207
[SPEAKER_08]: So whatever.

801
00:52:37,847 --> 00:52:39,688
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't want us to wait till E3, we'll talk to you now.

802
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:41,790
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's go to Skype line.

803
00:52:42,597 --> 00:52:44,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

804
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:45,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

805
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:46,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, who's this?

806
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Raven's Dolphin.

807
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Raven's Dolphin.

808
00:52:48,781 --> 00:52:49,502
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

809
00:52:50,602 --> 00:52:52,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the UMD movies.

810
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:53,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

811
00:52:54,765 --> 00:52:55,266
[SPEAKER_01]: What about them?

812
00:52:55,686 --> 00:52:56,847
[SPEAKER_01]: You a fan of UMD movies?

813
00:52:57,547 --> 00:52:58,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.

814
00:52:58,368 --> 00:52:59,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad they're going away.

815
00:52:59,729 --> 00:52:59,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

816
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:01,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

817
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I haven't bought one since that movie.

818
00:53:05,493 --> 00:53:06,453
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought one movie on it.

819
00:53:06,994 --> 00:53:07,414
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?

820
00:53:09,451 --> 00:53:09,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Evil Dead.

821
00:53:10,472 --> 00:53:11,092
[SPEAKER_01]: That was about it.

822
00:53:11,192 --> 00:53:11,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a good choice.

823
00:53:11,753 --> 00:53:12,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have good taste in movies.

824
00:53:14,254 --> 00:53:15,935
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about Bruce Campbell and his chin.

825
00:53:15,995 --> 00:53:20,618
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose if you're going to buy one UMD, you might as well buy that or Tron or Kill Bill.

826
00:53:20,878 --> 00:53:22,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Labyrinth.

827
00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:22,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Something cool.

828
00:53:23,219 --> 00:53:27,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Starring David Bowie and his... Why the hate for the UMDs then?

829
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:28,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you just not impressed with Evil Dead?

830
00:53:29,943 --> 00:53:30,963
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was impressed with it.

831
00:53:31,063 --> 00:53:35,446
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just I'm getting all my movies off BitTorrent and I'm just encoding it on my computer.

832
00:53:36,403 --> 00:53:50,090
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's the realistic world of what PSP has to deal with, is that, you know, the kids want to hack it and put their own movies on there, so it's a questionable legality thing there, but I guess that's what people are doing.

833
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:55,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the other thing, too, is they're also pushing these larger memory sticks, and what the hell are you going to use them for?

834
00:53:55,193 --> 00:53:56,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously not pictures.

835
00:53:56,133 --> 00:54:00,536
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be ripping DVDs or whatever to... Downloading great podcasts like Orange Lounge Radio.

836
00:54:01,316 --> 00:54:02,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, but still, though...

837
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:04,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Every week on my PSP.

838
00:54:05,097 --> 00:54:06,578
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I hear you.

839
00:54:06,598 --> 00:54:08,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you checked out olrpsp.com?

840
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I plug another podcast, another site?

841
00:54:13,002 --> 00:54:14,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, all right, sure.

842
00:54:14,943 --> 00:54:17,904
[SPEAKER_01]: pspdrive.com, it has your website.

843
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:19,485
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of that.

844
00:54:20,126 --> 00:54:22,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen our listing on pspdrive.com.

845
00:54:22,267 --> 00:54:22,947
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good site.

846
00:54:22,987 --> 00:54:23,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually used the portal.

847
00:54:23,908 --> 00:54:24,468
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a nice site.

848
00:54:25,449 --> 00:54:30,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they have a PSP 2.0, and I just downloaded wirelessly to the PSP.

849
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:34,438
[SPEAKER_08]: They were supporting podcasts before Sony was.

850
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:38,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a good site.

851
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:44,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen our little teeny reduced version of our graphic on there for PSPs, which I think is really cool because somebody obviously had to take the work to do that.

852
00:54:45,026 --> 00:54:46,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I really appreciate those guys.

853
00:54:46,947 --> 00:54:49,569
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

854
00:54:49,689 --> 00:54:52,931
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say that I have two Windows computers just like Loki.

855
00:54:53,732 --> 00:54:56,834
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a big Windows supporter and I support Windows just like he does.

856
00:54:57,402 --> 00:55:01,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's good to hear from a Loki fan, because sometimes we get the hate mails from the Mac users.

857
00:55:01,486 --> 00:55:02,066
[SPEAKER_08]: So, alright.

858
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:03,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one.

859
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:04,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for calling, buddy.

860
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:06,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Guy.

861
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:07,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a problem.

862
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:07,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

863
00:55:07,611 --> 00:55:16,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, if you don't know what we're referring to there, Loki has made comments about Macintoshes, and he's really sick of hearing about it, too, I think.

864
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,001
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm... yeah.

865
00:55:19,021 --> 00:55:19,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

866
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I just really, I don't care.

867
00:55:20,721 --> 00:55:23,624
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what happens when people download a show that's weeks and weeks old.

868
00:55:23,664 --> 00:55:25,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go over to this one.

869
00:55:25,965 --> 00:55:27,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

870
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:29,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I'm on Lyft.

871
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:31,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, hi, who's this?

872
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:36,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's Ranma calling in right now.

873
00:55:36,514 --> 00:55:38,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, you can see the video of Ranma there.

874
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:42,539
[SPEAKER_08]: But the problem is, Ranma, when you run in the video, it's really hard for us to hear you.

875
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:44,941
[SPEAKER_08]: But there he is, his little Zelda hat.

876
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:45,502
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cute.

877
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:47,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Ramma, call back.

878
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:48,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Turn off the video and call... Oh, there it is.

879
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,140
[SPEAKER_08]: It went off.

880
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,280
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

881
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:50,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better.

882
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Much better.

883
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:51,821
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

884
00:55:52,521 --> 00:55:54,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I want to cover a couple of things for you guys.

885
00:55:54,741 --> 00:55:54,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

886
00:55:55,342 --> 00:55:57,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when you talked about Penn & Teller Smoke and Mirrors?

887
00:55:57,802 --> 00:56:01,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the game that was like, yeah, ran on... I'm glad you called in on this.

888
00:56:01,763 --> 00:56:02,124
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?

889
00:56:02,904 --> 00:56:08,505
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that when I was listening to Penn Jillette's radio, his podcast, he talked about the game.

890
00:56:08,886 --> 00:56:09,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

891
00:56:09,646 --> 00:56:10,106
[SPEAKER_02]: What did he say?

892
00:56:10,126 --> 00:56:10,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

893
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:16,733
[SPEAKER_02]: He was basically the point of Smokey Mirrors was to go after Janet Reno who hated violent video games.

894
00:56:19,655 --> 00:56:20,435
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fabulous.

895
00:56:21,076 --> 00:56:21,576
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.

896
00:56:22,436 --> 00:56:24,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I am posting a link in the chat room now.

897
00:56:24,217 --> 00:56:26,679
[SPEAKER_02]: If you scroll down, you'll find where you can download it.

898
00:56:26,739 --> 00:56:29,920
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Penn & Teller's Real Life Games.

899
00:56:30,321 --> 00:56:35,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, it's 923freefm.com and you can probably navigate the site from there if you're not in chat right now.

900
00:56:35,984 --> 00:56:36,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

901
00:56:36,624 --> 00:56:36,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

902
00:56:37,945 --> 00:56:39,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, what else Ranma?

903
00:56:39,106 --> 00:56:39,706
[SPEAKER_08]: What else is on your mind?

904
00:56:40,245 --> 00:56:42,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go back to Catscom for a bit.

905
00:56:42,147 --> 00:56:45,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the awesome Zelda skit everybody was talking about?

906
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:46,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the one I didn't see.

907
00:56:47,672 --> 00:56:49,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm posting a link to it right now.

908
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:50,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can download it.

909
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:56,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you scroll that all the way down, it's called Katsu2006-link.

910
00:56:56,732 --> 00:57:01,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and that video is on the website Usagichan3.com, so check that out.

911
00:57:01,853 --> 00:57:04,954
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, post it in our forums or something so people can find that link later.

912
00:57:05,154 --> 00:57:07,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you guys see that Zelda fan movie that someone made?

913
00:57:07,975 --> 00:57:08,935
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard about it.

914
00:57:08,975 --> 00:57:09,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that.

915
00:57:09,435 --> 00:57:10,095
[SPEAKER_08]: That was awesome.

916
00:57:10,155 --> 00:57:14,596
[SPEAKER_08]: It missed the cut for tonight's show because it's not really official, but it's interesting.

917
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:16,837
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be interesting if they actually finish it and...

918
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:22,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you think Nintendo is going to bring down the Swift Hammer of Justice on that project?

919
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily, I don't know.

920
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,121
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just fan stuff.

921
00:57:26,181 --> 00:57:28,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Ranchan, you need to come to Fanime with us.

922
00:57:29,221 --> 00:57:30,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Fanime 2007.

923
00:57:31,062 --> 00:57:32,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we'll be there.

924
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:37,783
[SPEAKER_08]: If our panels go over well, tell your friends in the anime community to come to our panels.

925
00:57:38,483 --> 00:57:38,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I will.

926
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:41,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Unlike they did at KatsuCon.

927
00:57:42,048 --> 00:57:43,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, you got screwed over.

928
00:57:43,709 --> 00:57:45,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Believe you me, I'm just as pissed as you are.

929
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to put a dig in there somehow.

930
00:57:47,051 --> 00:57:47,731
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.

931
00:57:47,771 --> 00:57:48,411
[SPEAKER_08]: I learned a lot.

932
00:57:48,471 --> 00:57:48,872
[SPEAKER_08]: I learned a lot.

933
00:57:48,892 --> 00:57:51,653
[SPEAKER_00]: I did make sure to specify that our panel is on a Saturday.

934
00:57:52,293 --> 00:57:52,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

935
00:57:53,174 --> 00:57:55,555
[SPEAKER_08]: And I met some great people at Katsugana.

936
00:57:55,575 --> 00:57:56,396
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the important thing.

937
00:57:57,984 --> 00:57:58,685
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the important thing.

938
00:57:58,705 --> 00:58:01,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And now there's a guy out there handing out flyers for us.

939
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:01,687
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

940
00:58:02,007 --> 00:58:02,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I love our fans.

941
00:58:02,748 --> 00:58:03,328
[SPEAKER_08]: They're so great.

942
00:58:03,769 --> 00:58:06,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma, I've got to let you go so we can get to more of our listeners, okay?

943
00:58:06,811 --> 00:58:07,312
[SPEAKER_08]: You take care.

944
00:58:07,372 --> 00:58:09,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one, buddy.

945
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:10,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I just cut him off.

946
00:58:10,274 --> 00:58:10,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, didn't mean to.

947
00:58:11,435 --> 00:58:12,696
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's go to another call here.

948
00:58:13,537 --> 00:58:14,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

949
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

950
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:21,243
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're not.

951
00:58:21,443 --> 00:58:22,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, who's this?

952
00:58:23,965 --> 00:58:25,386
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Xander from China.

953
00:58:25,746 --> 00:58:26,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Xander from China.

954
00:58:26,847 --> 00:58:27,488
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

955
00:58:29,738 --> 00:58:30,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Kingdom Hearts 2 I'm like 17 hours into it right now.

956
00:58:31,439 --> 00:58:31,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah?

957
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:31,619
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

958
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:59,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, obviously I'm liking it quite a bit because otherwise I wouldn't have bothered going through all the stupid cutscenes.

959
00:59:00,168 --> 00:59:07,977
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's probably one of my biggest complaints about the game is that the cutscenes are really low quality, in all honesty.

960
00:59:08,037 --> 00:59:08,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them are.

961
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:09,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

962
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,662
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the cutscenes have been great so far.

963
00:59:12,563 --> 00:59:13,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how far are you?

964
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,321
[SPEAKER_08]: The worst one for me, though, that ruined it, was the one in Mulan.

965
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:34,711
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 Heartless Chasing Him

966
00:59:57,919 --> 00:59:58,980
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's no music.

967
01:00:00,641 --> 01:00:01,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so pissed off.

968
01:00:23,279 --> 01:00:24,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate their costumes.

969
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,301
[SPEAKER_00]: The part that's funny about that, though, is playing it in Japanese.

970
01:00:29,241 --> 01:00:32,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing them sing Under the Sea in Japanese is just hilarious.

971
01:00:33,583 --> 01:00:36,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe it's a music game where you press one button.

972
01:00:38,346 --> 01:00:40,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Xander, any other comments on Kingdom Hearts 2?

973
01:00:40,907 --> 01:00:44,288
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to keep it moving because we've got a lot of people trying to call in tonight, but any other comments on Kingdom Hearts 2?

974
01:00:45,089 --> 01:00:46,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really enjoying it.

975
01:00:46,249 --> 01:00:48,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very different from the first game, so...

976
01:00:48,735 --> 01:00:53,597
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you didn't like the first game, you might like this one, although you wouldn't understand it if you didn't finish it.

977
01:00:54,577 --> 01:00:56,418
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree, but Miklatov's shaking his head no.

978
01:00:56,578 --> 01:00:58,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it still has a bad camera.

979
01:00:58,319 --> 01:00:59,879
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's much better, much better.

980
01:00:59,899 --> 01:01:00,380
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still bad.

981
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:03,341
[SPEAKER_08]: All you do is lock onto the target, and the camera follows it.

982
01:01:03,401 --> 01:01:03,841
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easy.

983
01:01:04,421 --> 01:01:10,524
[SPEAKER_08]: In the first game, you would lock on, and the camera would still go behind smokes and mirrors and everything, and it made it a pain in the ass, but this one's much better.

984
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually disagree on that.

985
01:01:12,164 --> 01:01:12,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

986
01:01:12,404 --> 01:01:14,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the camera's actually worse than this one.

987
01:01:14,485 --> 01:01:16,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I had less problems with the camera than this one.

988
01:01:16,366 --> 01:01:16,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw you people!

989
01:01:18,493 --> 01:01:27,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you what, my favorite part so far, I know I just played this part, I don't want to give spoilers, but the boss fight in Beast's Castle was awesome.

990
01:01:28,437 --> 01:01:29,078
[SPEAKER_08]: It was awesome.

991
01:01:29,538 --> 01:01:30,218
[SPEAKER_08]: The end one?

992
01:01:30,418 --> 01:01:30,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

993
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:32,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't say much more.

994
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:33,119
[SPEAKER_08]: It was awesome.

995
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man, yeah, that was good.

996
01:01:35,841 --> 01:01:36,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's all I can say.

997
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:37,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you watching?

998
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:38,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was watching.

999
01:01:38,842 --> 01:01:39,822
[SPEAKER_06]: It was okay.

1000
01:01:40,122 --> 01:01:41,023
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a bad camera.

1001
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:44,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Xander, I gotta let you go before Shane pisses me off more, okay?

1002
01:01:44,204 --> 01:01:45,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's fine.

1003
01:01:45,685 --> 01:01:46,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one, bye.

1004
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:48,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go.

1005
01:01:48,498 --> 01:01:49,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do one more call.

1006
01:01:50,479 --> 01:01:51,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1007
01:01:55,201 --> 01:01:56,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, can you hear me?

1008
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:57,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, what's on your mind?

1009
01:02:00,944 --> 01:02:04,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm in a really hacky mood.

1010
01:02:04,686 --> 01:02:05,846
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in a hacky mood?

1011
01:02:07,467 --> 01:02:10,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've been hacking a lot of things recently, like physically.

1012
01:02:10,809 --> 01:02:11,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Who is this, by the way?

1013
01:02:11,669 --> 01:02:12,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot to ask who this is.

1014
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:12,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Who is this?

1015
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:13,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1016
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:14,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Maniac 64

1017
01:02:29,318 --> 01:02:32,261
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I haven't even thought about doing that.

1018
01:02:32,301 --> 01:02:33,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I read that on a forum this week.

1019
01:02:33,622 --> 01:02:36,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody just casually said putting their controller in the PC.

1020
01:02:36,585 --> 01:02:37,927
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought, that's a really good idea.

1021
01:02:38,007 --> 01:02:39,789
[SPEAKER_08]: I could use that for Final Fantasy and stuff.

1022
01:02:40,009 --> 01:02:40,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that work?

1023
01:02:40,569 --> 01:02:41,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just plug it in and go?

1024
01:02:41,931 --> 01:02:44,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do I have to hack it?

1025
01:02:44,053 --> 01:02:47,136
[SPEAKER_07]: You can download the drivers off of Microsoft's site.

1026
01:02:47,336 --> 01:02:48,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I was asking the caller.

1027
01:02:48,778 --> 01:02:50,079
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's fine.

1028
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:51,080
[SPEAKER_04]: But those drivers suck.

1029
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:53,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, they worked fine for me.

1030
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:53,779
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you find?

1031
01:02:53,799 --> 01:02:54,980
[SPEAKER_04]: There's better drivers out there.

1032
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,520
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get them off redcloud.com.

1033
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:58,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll post the link.

1034
01:02:58,700 --> 01:02:59,681
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, yeah, post the link.

1035
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:05,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll check that out because I want to use it for Final Fantasy XI on the computer, which is ironic because I want to get Final Fantasy XI on 360.

1036
01:03:05,402 --> 01:03:06,002
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so sad.

1037
01:03:06,502 --> 01:03:07,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we are sad.

1038
01:03:07,882 --> 01:03:08,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're doing it too.

1039
01:03:10,283 --> 01:03:14,123
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you find that you're using the Xbox 360 controller for on the PC?

1040
01:03:14,183 --> 01:03:17,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you emulating games or what are you doing with it?

1041
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:23,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I do some of that, but not much because my computers are so much crap that I can't do much of that.

1042
01:03:24,282 --> 01:03:29,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, pretty much the main thing I do is I play F-Zero Climax.

1043
01:03:32,004 --> 01:03:32,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's cool.

1044
01:03:33,024 --> 01:03:33,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

1045
01:03:33,464 --> 01:03:33,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1046
01:03:34,304 --> 01:03:34,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1047
01:03:34,665 --> 01:03:38,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I did some other hacking.

1048
01:03:38,505 --> 01:03:39,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, what else?

1049
01:03:39,726 --> 01:03:40,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1050
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:46,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I got my standard headset mic that I'm using right now to work with my DS.

1051
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:53,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, is that why you were saying in chat earlier in the show that you really wanted to play Metroid with somebody for voice chat?

1052
01:03:54,047 --> 01:03:55,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wanted to test it out.

1053
01:03:55,588 --> 01:03:56,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

1054
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:58,830
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I played my first multiplayer Metroid last night, finally.

1055
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:01,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I owned at it, I'd just like to say.

1056
01:04:01,932 --> 01:04:02,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was when you were sleeping.

1057
01:04:02,832 --> 01:04:03,192
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fun.

1058
01:04:03,212 --> 01:04:03,712
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good.

1059
01:04:04,153 --> 01:04:06,094
[SPEAKER_08]: You were sleeping because you had to go to Best Buy at 3 a.m.

1060
01:04:06,114 --> 01:04:07,555
[SPEAKER_08]: because you were afraid there was going to be a huge line.

1061
01:04:07,595 --> 01:04:07,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1062
01:04:08,635 --> 01:04:09,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stupid.

1063
01:04:09,736 --> 01:04:09,996
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1064
01:04:10,656 --> 01:04:13,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo Maniac 64, I've got to let you go because we're running really long here.

1065
01:04:13,338 --> 01:04:14,138
[SPEAKER_08]: But have a good one, okay?

1066
01:04:14,158 --> 01:04:14,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1067
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:15,319
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1068
01:04:15,339 --> 01:04:15,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

1069
01:04:16,872 --> 01:04:17,452
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1070
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:45,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1071
01:04:46,162 --> 01:04:48,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Panzer Dragoon and Die Hard.

1072
01:04:48,363 --> 01:04:49,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I've got my attention.

1073
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:23,044
[SPEAKER_00]: which for anyone who knows about this in Japan it was a Panzer Dragoon RPG but it's really hard to get your hands on however though for the Sega Ages collection there is a Panzer Dragoon collection and Die Hard which was a Dynamite DECA in Japan but however keep in mind these are Sega Ages these are meant to be cheap the Sega Ages 2900 is named 2900 for 2900 yen as in really cheap

1074
01:05:29,471 --> 01:05:30,372
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, 2,500.

1075
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:30,952
[SPEAKER_00]: My apologies.

1076
01:05:31,532 --> 01:05:40,518
[SPEAKER_00]: So, don't expect them to be, you know, made uber pretty, all gorgeous, everything, but they are supposed to be retouched, looking better.

1077
01:05:41,339 --> 01:05:46,882
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, which would be a good thing because I really liked the Dynamite DECA series and Panzer Dragoon was really neat.

1078
01:05:47,103 --> 01:05:49,784
[SPEAKER_00]: So, should be fun.

1079
01:05:50,365 --> 01:05:50,645
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1080
01:05:51,348 --> 01:05:54,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did find them up for pre-order on a couple sites.

1081
01:05:54,469 --> 01:05:57,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I like those Sega Ages games, unlike some people.

1082
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:01,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Phantasy Star 2 was just released on the Sega Ages.

1083
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:06,133
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't seen any translations for these come out yet.

1084
01:06:07,033 --> 01:06:07,513
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's true.

1085
01:06:07,533 --> 01:06:10,034
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been basically playing them when we have a friend over.

1086
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,255
[SPEAKER_00]: But the remakes are really nice.

1087
01:06:13,295 --> 01:06:19,637
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I have the Phantasy Zone and Space Harrier remakes, which are really, really nice.

1088
01:06:20,789 --> 01:06:23,150
[SPEAKER_00]: I can vouch for these Sega Ages collections.

1089
01:06:23,371 --> 01:06:27,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a bit of these have been re-released.

1090
01:06:29,034 --> 01:06:37,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I also like that Sega and Ages are... Not acronyms, but when you shuffle the letters around.

1091
01:06:37,978 --> 01:06:39,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Antigrams, thank you.

1092
01:06:39,459 --> 01:06:40,400
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

1093
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're so smart.

1094
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:41,780
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.

1095
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that how you get jobs with video game companies?

1096
01:06:44,822 --> 01:06:45,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1097
01:06:45,402 --> 01:06:46,463
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a smart feller.

1098
01:06:46,892 --> 01:06:49,213
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki, anything for us, last minute-wise?

1099
01:06:50,013 --> 01:06:58,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the first thing I was going to mention is that the cheat device for Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories is finally 1.0 now, and they added a few things.

1100
01:06:58,836 --> 01:07:00,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Hover cars, which is pretty cool.

1101
01:07:01,216 --> 01:07:10,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Gather spell, which causes the objects on the screen to basically hover around some fixed gravity point or something like that, and you can throw them at stuff.

1102
01:07:10,939 --> 01:07:16,461
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a full-size video recorder now, and also drivable RC toys.

1103
01:07:17,796 --> 01:07:18,937
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1104
01:07:43,888 --> 01:07:44,148
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1105
01:07:45,329 --> 01:07:46,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other last-minute stories?

1106
01:07:46,811 --> 01:07:47,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone?

1107
01:07:47,451 --> 01:07:47,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone?

1108
01:07:48,332 --> 01:07:48,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone?

1109
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:50,594
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1110
01:07:50,714 --> 01:07:51,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Bueller?

1111
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:56,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have any really good, fuzzy last-news story of the night, so sorry to say.

1112
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,480
[SPEAKER_08]: So that brings us to the end of the show.

1113
01:07:59,021 --> 01:08:02,544
[SPEAKER_08]: April Fool's Day kind of screwed everything up this week news-wise, so what can you do?

1114
01:08:03,565 --> 01:08:03,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1115
01:08:04,574 --> 01:08:06,234
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the end of the show, and that's no joke.

1116
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:08,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1117
01:08:08,495 --> 01:08:11,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Miklatov, thanks for joining us, even if it was for only half the show.

1118
01:08:11,336 --> 01:08:12,096
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

1119
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:13,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Have fun with your Xbox 360.

1120
01:08:13,816 --> 01:08:14,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try.

1121
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:17,797
[SPEAKER_08]: May you go through the same hell I went through with the groundbreaking... I can only hope.

1122
01:08:19,518 --> 01:08:21,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Add me to your friends list, OMG.

1123
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:21,718
[SPEAKER_08]: I already did.

1124
01:08:21,758 --> 01:08:22,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you did.

1125
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:23,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just being stupid.

1126
01:08:23,378 --> 01:08:25,739
[SPEAKER_00]: May all your camera angles be nice and joyous.

1127
01:08:25,799 --> 01:08:28,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, may all your camera angles not be like Kingdom Hearts, okay?

1128
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:29,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Hooray.

1129
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,000
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1130
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:31,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thought.

1131
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:34,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I let you have a final thought?

1132
01:08:34,169 --> 01:08:34,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1133
01:08:34,629 --> 01:08:34,990
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1134
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:35,830
[SPEAKER_08]: What is your final thought?

1135
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:36,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1136
01:08:36,911 --> 01:08:37,191
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1137
01:08:37,371 --> 01:08:38,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what's your final thought?

1138
01:08:39,052 --> 01:08:42,934
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is I may be buying a laptop this week.

1139
01:08:45,595 --> 01:08:47,096
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is buy an iBook.

1140
01:08:47,116 --> 01:08:47,776
[SPEAKER_08]: You know you want one.

1141
01:08:47,997 --> 01:08:48,357
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't.

1142
01:08:48,477 --> 01:08:49,757
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1143
01:08:51,498 --> 01:08:53,239
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have my iMac very soon.

1144
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,401
[SPEAKER_08]: It's two against one, Loki.

1145
01:08:56,221 --> 01:08:57,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not buying an iMac.

1146
01:08:57,262 --> 01:08:59,823
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm keeping my nice PC laptop.

1147
01:09:00,705 --> 01:09:03,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said on a previous episode, I'm bi when it comes to computers.

1148
01:09:03,946 --> 01:09:04,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I use both.

1149
01:09:05,046 --> 01:09:06,786
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next one will be my Linux box.

1150
01:09:08,927 --> 01:09:15,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you guys so much for tuning into and listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting Independent Radio.

1151

[SPEAKER_08]: We love our chat room.

[SPEAKER_08]: You guys in the chat room are so awesome.

1155
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:26,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I could just reach out and give you all a big hug or a handshake.

1156
01:09:26,571 --> 01:09:27,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Rob.

[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we do.

1160
01:09:31,102 --> 01:09:31,543
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.

1161
01:09:34,085 --> 01:09:34,665
I check it.

1162
01:09:35,566 --> 01:09:38,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, flood the mailbag so DarkSakura has work to do this week.

1163
01:09:38,668 --> 01:09:41,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I actually do work at my job now.

1164
01:09:41,691 --> 01:09:41,971
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1165
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:44,593
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's it.

1166
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:46,054
[SPEAKER_08]: We're done with the show.

1167
01:09:46,214 --> 01:09:55,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So until next week, this is Sky for my co-hosts, DarkSakura, Loki, special guest Miklatov, saying have a good week.
