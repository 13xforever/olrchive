00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,320
Today, April 2nd, 2006. April Fools hits the web, but is Final Fantasy 13 a joke? Is the

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:28,040
Xbox 360 drought finally over? And are UMD movies about to meet an untimely fate?

3
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:37,720
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,000
We are here gathered together to talk about video games, our favorites and sometimes our

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
least favorites.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,120
My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,120
You might know me as Sky.

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:56,120
Joining me, as always, say hello to the lovely co-host, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers, and also

9
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,960
Also in corner number two, say hello to the not-so-lovely Loki.

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Hey, how you doing?

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
Good.

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
Alright.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,960
Dark Sakura.

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
What?

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
I see you eating food here.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
Did you bring enough to share?

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
No.

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
What's this you're munching on?

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,960
I'm responsible for my own dinner.

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
Alright, what's this you're munching on?

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:19,320
I'm eating an organic unbleached flour mushroom leek strudel with black sesame seeds on it.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm not sure what to think of that.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,920
That sounds a little...

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Ew.

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,920
It's delicious!

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,520
I don't know if it's ew, but it just it sounds very intimidating

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,460
It's like it's like, you know

28
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,640
Those people that get married and have hyphenated last names and then their kids get married and all have like the hyphenated last names

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,640
That's what it sounds like. You just ate

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,840
Like eight of those names. It's it's very delicious

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,960
I I do a lot of my shopping now at Whole Foods markets, which is all organic food. It's expensive. It is expensive

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,600
Oh my god

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,840
but I have felt so healthy the last two months since I've started eating all organic and vegetarian and

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
and cut out red meat and I don't drink soda anymore.

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,000
I had a soda yesterday.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,600
I had a diet vanilla Pepsi and it made my stomach hurt.

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,480
I still drink diet but I try very hard

38
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,320
not to drink regular soda.

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,920
I make my own soda now.

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,440
I buy club soda and Torani, the flavored syrup.

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,640
Oh, so kind of like Italian soda.

42
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,880
Yeah, I do Italian sodas.

43
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,920
Okay, oh, because you can get the sugar-free ones.

44
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,760
Those aren't so bad.

45
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,040
And I also make carbonated lemonade.

46
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,720
using club soda and lemon juice

47
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,540
and lime juice and Splenda. Not for me. I like ice cream tea.

48
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,040
That's my drink of choice. Anyway, we're starting to sound like Food Network over here. Sorry guys.

49
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,480
I have been all about the cooking though. I've really been...

50
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,680
I need Iron Chef the game. What would you recommend? Make this gaming related

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,280
somewhat. What would you recommend gamers who are typically

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,640
sitting there with a bag of Doritos playing, you know, EverQuest all night

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,000
long?

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,320
What's a good recommendation for them to like break that habit? What's something

55
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,520
else they could do to feed their snack addiction or what have you?

56
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,240
Carrots. Sliced apples.

57
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,600
Popcorn. You know, like some plain popcorn.

58
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,720
Soy nuts. They're good. Cashews.

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,440
Cashews are very good for you. They have good oils. And brown rice.

60
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,520
And super bacon. No super bacon.

61
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,800
That's bad for you. That's like a heart attack recipe right there.

62
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,920
Alright, let's get away from the Food Network and do a little bit of how was your gaming

63
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
week?

64
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,400
The part of the show where we talk about what we've been playing this week and what we've

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
been up to.

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,320
And I know I've got a lot, I don't know about the others, but DarkSakura, you always start

67
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
us off.

68
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
What have you been playing this week?

69
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,920
Well, we've had quite a bit of new gaming coming in the house.

70
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,840
I've actually got BeatMania, been playing the crap out of it.

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,520
I have Kingdom Hearts 2, but since I was already playing it in Japanese I've been sort of not

72
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,720
so much about that.

73
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm going to start over on that probably within the week after I get my stupid flash

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
homework done.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,360
Um, and I'm also, we, uh, Fries, of all places, is carrying import, um, PSP games.

76
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,760
I noticed that last time I went to Fries, for those, because we're nationwide, Fries

77
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,240
is a big electronics chain on the west coast, and they've started to carry limited import

78
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
games.

79
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
We bought Initial D!

80
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Oh wow!

81
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,240
That's cool.

82
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,440
The, the new Initial D game is really, really cool, it's based off of, I think, the version

83
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,800
three that's out in the arcade and it's really pretty it's eurobeat fantastic

84
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,920
lots and lots of eurobeat but it's it's initial d I guess not much else I can

85
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,560
say about that they're also had out the title collection that we're sort of

86
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,640
considering except that it's coming out in the u.s. sort of like a no point to

87
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,160
that and we almost picked up a guilty gear but that's also coming out in the

88
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,640
u.s. so we were sort of not so much on that too but and Dan and his friend have

89
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,800
been playing a whole lot of burnout oh my god I'm so tired of that game

90
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,200
well why am I so tired of the burnout just anything over and over I'm in my

91
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,800
okay my computer room is on the other side of where our big TV is so I'm in

92
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,440
the middle of working on like my my flash homework right now is to do this

93
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,800
big photo slideshow so I've been trying to get my photos all together and I'm

94
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:10,320
just about to do my last little touch great and then we've also had a MAME

95
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,360
action going on because one of Dan's co-workers and a friend of mine George

96
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,900
neko boy right he and our friend Tim who is actually for anyone who's in cosplay

97
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,560
circles he is very well known because he does the fabulous Rick Hunter Macross

98
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,960
outfit. He did Ava One at Anime Expo. He's been in Japanese cosplay photos. He also

99
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,840
has been helping build main cabinets in my garage.

100
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,640
So you have more than one now? We're building George.

101
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,160
We haven't talked about this on the show in a while, but both Dark

102
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,480
Sakura and Loki have main cabinets in their house. Now Dark Sakura, you guys

103
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,440
took a pole position? We took a stand-up pole position. They're building this

104
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,200
one out of some other generic one, but it has this fabulous 1982

105
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,160
aren't on it and so it's it's like really super cool but they were they

106
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,580
were working on this all day while me and the fabulous miss Tia were running

107
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,540
around where where did they get the specs on how to do this like are they

108
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,580
doing it off a website off of just crash and burn there is a website and if you

109
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,120
give me just a second I can get it because um it's the one that my husband

110
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,960
goes to which happens to be on my favorites bar called it's a arcade

111
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,200
controls comm slash arcade dot HTM is basically build your own arcade

112
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,620
controls FAQ this is how to build your it goes a lot into the cabinets it goes

113
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,980
into how to build the controllers what you need for it it's really really neat

114
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:37,940
um and actually I'll talk to Dan about getting the specs on his cabinet so if

115
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,540
anybody else is interested all right sounds cool yeah all right Loki how was

116
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,740
your gaming week play any of your main cabinet now you actually built your

117
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,060
cabinet you didn't convert a machine you built a brand new yes and it shows we

118
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,300
You were roommates back when you were building that, and I just remember that was a project.

119
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,620
Yeah, to say the least.

120
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,260
Most of the project is being stored at my parents' house over in their garage because

121
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,800
the, like what, six other control panels that go with it, I don't have any room to store

122
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,820
them if I were to even build them.

123
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,500
But soon, as soon as we get a house, that sucker's getting built.

124
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Someday.

125
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Alright, how was your gaming week?

126
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:27,340
Okay, I played a lot of 360 stuff again, I think I played a little bit of Oblivion, I

127
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,420
played more Outfit, and I realized that game really sucks.

128
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
Really?

129
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,420
What?

130
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:37,260
Now this isn't really my kind of game, so I haven't really been playing a lot of it,

131
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,060
but I've listened to other shows that seem to really like this game, so what's your issue

132
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,060
with it?

133
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,440
It's, well my issue with it, I try to play multiplayer, and again, we're just with two

134
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,440
2 player split screen, which is fine. For one, the controls really suck in it. Like,

135
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,460
I kept calling in the destruction on demand, the big feature where you get stuff to fall

136
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:04,340
from the sky, and the stuff falling from the sky kept crushing my characters. I would aim

137
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:10,460
it further away from me, and the stupid piece of crap jeep or whatever I was calling into

138
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:16,740
battle would get caught in the wind and crush. There goes half my team. So that's actually

139
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,820
you can use that I guess to your advantage if you know you have stupid AI that you're

140
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,820
fighting against you can just call in some destruction on demand and they would drop

141
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,620
a jeep on the other team or something. I don't know but I didn't find it very fun at all.

142
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,940
I did however pick up Far Cry Instincts Predator which I've never played the original Far

143
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,300
Cry Instincts but from what I hear it's not very different as far as graphics and stuff.

144
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,300
a little bit of graphic upgrades and stuff but um...

145
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,700
it is pretty fun. It is kind of...

146
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,300
actually it's very hard

147
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,900
um... very frustrating

148
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,300
so I started to cheat

149
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,940
and now it's fun

150
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,340
I love how they put the cheats in there because cheats make it fun. It's still really

151
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,300
challenging but it kind of

152
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,480
lightens it up a little bit

153
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,740
so I'm kind of looking forward to that and then

154
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,820
played more Burnout, more

155
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,620
Ghost Recon

156
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:20,260
And uh, here are the cheats working that too. And what else? Me, Mike Katamari, Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City, Stories. All that fun stuff.

157
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,820
I played a little bit of Beatmania. Didn't like it.

158
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,020
Oh, why not?

159
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:32,620
The interface is too colorful and to be honest I didn't think the new controllers were that great.

160
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:38,420
And I don't know why. I mean before they seemed to be pretty good but that turntable doesn't seem- it seems to be sticky, the turntable.

161
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,740
and it loosens up after you play with it a bit

162
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,860
and I don't know it's just even new songs were kinda okay but

163
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,540
I just wasn't very impressed by it. It was just kinda

164
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,060
yay cool Beatmania anything

165
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,620
you know to go I'm not gonna go rush out they'll go buy it though

166
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,720
so. Alright. My gaming week also consisted of Beatmania

167
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,780
which I picked up earlier in the week so kinda funny there we've all played that

168
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,580
But, of course, that's not a surprise when you consider that we started as a music gaming station.

169
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,580
Obviously, we owe a lot to Beatmania.

170
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,980
I think it's very interesting, Beatmania, because when you consider it,

171
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,980
Beatmania is about, what, eight years old?

172
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,280
And this is really the first time that it's coming out in the U.S. for console.

173
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,780
I mean, of course, we had the hip-hop mania in the arcades a couple years ago,

174
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,580
but nobody really remembers that.

175
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,080
So, this is really the first time we've had Beatmania or 2DX on a console here.

176
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,520
So it's really BeatMania's first release.

177
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,060
It's really interesting how they've kind of thrown it all together like this blender together

178
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,980
of stuff from the five key world and the seven key world.

179
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:51,000
As expected, this version is much more accessible to beginners in the fact that there is no

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,760
separate mode for beginner mode, but they fuse the beginning level songs into the normal

181
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,700
game, which I think is good because I think you don't want to scare people off because

182
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:08,420
even though Beatmania is selling itself as bringing the arcade experience home, which

183
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,700
kind of is a little weird to me because there's really nothing but import machines for Beatmania.

184
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:20,700
It was kind of weird there. I think it's a good first exposure for people. I find it

185
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,700
...

186
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,580
There was a lot of the old Five Key music in there, did you notice?

187
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,220
Oh yeah, I noticed a lot of really old, like Hunting For You and Metal Gear. This is really,

188
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,540
really old songs, but I think that's cool because they picked some good stuff. They

189
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,400
They have a very interesting song list, I think the five key song list is actually pretty

190
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
solid.

191
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,640
I think they got a good mix of stuff.

192
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:43,540
Seven key, for me, could use some more recent stuff, but I think I understand why they're

193
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,220
doing what they're doing, because if there is to be a second mix, then they can start

194
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,720
dipping into the later stuff and things, you know.

195
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,040
Yeah.

196
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,440
Did you like the Moby song?

197
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,760
I did like the Moby song, I like the video.

198
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,600
I think the Timo Ma song's the best, though.

199
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,880
Dan and I sat there with the Moby song going, what is this?

200
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,400
I liked it, I think it's good. Dan and I are both like Moby, but we just didn't like that one.

201
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,160
Here's the interesting thing is that I notice this in a lot of reviews. BeatMania has

202
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,880
been getting a lot of negative reviews out there on the circuit right now

203
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,200
and a lot of people can't seem to

204
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,880
not want to compare this to Guitar Hero. Everybody's comparing this game to Guitar

205
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,460
Hero, which

206
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,080
I think is kind of funny because this game existed long before Guitar Hero

207
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,880
in the world scope of things but in the US scope of things since its first time

208
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,120
it's getting a release here

209
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,560
you know it's it's inevitable people are gonna compare to Guitar Hero.

210
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,840
It's not like actual reviewers do any research on anything.

211
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,880
Anyway doesn't matter so I think though there is an inevitable comparison to be

212
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,760
made to Guitar Hero though because what Guitar Hero did successfully

213
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,840
and the reason why everybody loves Guitar Hero is the song list

214
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,840
and yes even though they have a bunch of cover songs

215
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,700
They're done. Well, the cover songs are done. Well, they're pretty faithful to the originals and it really ups that fun factor

216
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:05,200
the problem with beat mania and why I don't think beat mania is gonna have that same buzz as guitar hero is now set the

217
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,640
Bars that a lot of these songs are not recognizable to most people

218
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,260
They tried a little bit with the song list that you know, you got toxic and funky town

219
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:20,820
Okay, people know those songs, but there's a lot of songs in there. They're not so recognizable. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

220
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:27,140
That thing, I don't know, I'm spoiled by years of Japanese releases, so I do recognize all

221
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
the songs that are in there.

222
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,100
It's hard for me to look at this game impartially when I've been raised on the Japanese series

223
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,140
for years and years.

224
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,140
It's just weird.

225
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,140
I don't really know.

226
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,880
I think it's going to be interesting to see how the general public reacts to this.

227
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,580
Are they going to pick up on this game even though there aren't a lot of recognizable

228
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,580
songs?

229
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,580
I don't know.

230
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,180
last night including some people who don't play games a whole lot and I know

231
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,780
a few of them were really digging on Beatmania they thought it was kind of

232
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,060
fun and very pretty even though they didn't really recognize a lot of the

233
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:02,180
songs in it so did you notice that three two one stars is the another yeah just

234
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:08,160
to make it a little harder there plus they they did something weird with five

235
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,060
keys is that there's only the one difficulty I thought that was kind of

236
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,180
odd they just made some very odd changes like the one that really irks me is that

237
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,100
they made the triple A's a lot lower in score to be able to get and just in

238
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,060
general the grading is a little easier and I think I mean look I understand why

239
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,380
they want to do that again they're trying to cater to the beginners and

240
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,580
people haven't seen the game before but I kind of go you have to lower the bar

241
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,420
on triple A's I mean people aren't gonna just get discouraged if they get an A or

242
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,900
a double A on a song but you know did you have to make triple A's easier to get

243
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:44,660
to like I don't know I don't know overall I like Beatmania and I think

244
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,500
people who are into music games should check it out, and I think it's a very solid first

245
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,900
release, especially when you put it side by side with DDR first mix.

246
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,260
It's a hell of a good first release compared to what DDR first mix was, and I think there's

247
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,940
a potential for really great stuff in the future, and you just kind of have to think,

248
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,580
okay, if Beatmania can grow the same way DDR did, it's going to be great, but you know,

249
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,020
we have to have a little faith here in the beginning, so we'll see what happens.

250
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,540
I want to say hello to our chat room over at www.orangelaungeradio.com.

251
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:20,780
a chat and always looking for your comments there let's see the 23rd Magus

252
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,020
says I believe this is a response to Guitar Hero they made music games

253
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,580
accessible they made music games accessible it's a very you know

254
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,700
interesting statement is that a lot of people sometimes get put off by the DDR

255
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,220
pad and by the you know turntables and the keys and seeing all those notes

256
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,980
falling but there was something about Guitar Hero was a little different I

257
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,260
I don't know, very interesting.

258
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:48,360
So again, if you want to join our chat, www.orangelaungerator.com and click on chat.

259
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,160
And 23rd Magus wants to also point out that they actually have the calculations, if you

260
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,360
want to look at calculations for the true AAAs, that there are websites out there that

261
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,440
will let you know how your score compares to the Japanese version.

262
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,420
One of them he's mentioning is VJ Army.

263
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,760
So pretty interesting.

264
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,060
I did notice that it was ridiculously easy, but it was sort of nicer because the good

265
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,940
thing about this is that I could play it with Dan, and Dan's not really a BeatMania person.

266
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,560
He was playing on my old controller.

267
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
That's cool.

268
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,400
I felt so bad for him, because really my old controller is now hitting the crappy phase.

269
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,480
I think, and what I call these folks sometimes are the Japanese elitists out there on some

270
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,440
of the websites, that nothing is good enough unless it's the Japanese version.

271
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,360
The American versions will always be shit.

272
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,940
I think the problem with the Japanese elitists out there on the message boards when it comes

273
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,280
to Beatmania is that they forget that these games aren't made for them.

274
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,860
They think that Konami owes them something because they've been buying the games for

275
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,960
years and years.

276
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,460
That got Konami to release the game here, but still, the game is not for you.

277
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,040
It's for everybody.

278
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,620
They'll toss a couple frickin' bones at the loyal supporters.

279
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,500
was a couple night style songs in there and there's there's some you know kind

280
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,100
of neat stuff I think just having the five key and seven key in there is

281
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,100
pretty neat you know but the game's not for you it's for everybody well I

282
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,060
honestly did think that the song selection was pretty sparse in

283
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,580
comparison because think about like the last one that I bought was eighth style

284
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:22,260
and think about just how many freaking songs were in eighth style but still

285
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,820
when you consider that we have both modes I do sort of wish that you could

286
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:30,780
do the seven key stuff in five key mode you know to do that too but I see why

287
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,980
they did it the way that they did it really is like you're getting two games

288
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:39,620
in one just both with very sparse song lists so I recommend beat mania if for

289
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,980
no other reason than I want to see a beat mania second mix released here in

290
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,100
the u.s. and you know it is good I think everybody should at least check it out

291
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,260
you know because even if you're scared of DDR there's no reason to be scared of

292
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,380
beat mania well I know I personally I didn't pick it up because one I know

293
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:00,220
economics send me a free one too because if it's anything like guitar hero I'll

294
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,860
play it once and not play it for again which I did with my guitar hero it is

295
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:10,660
leaning up against my main cabinet because eventually it will be used for

296
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,460
good guitar freaks guitar guitar hero is a party game for me it's like it's

297
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,820
sitting there in the corner and then when people come over they go what's

298
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,980
that guitar hero yeah you know and it's you know I think beatmania is gonna be

299
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,300
kind of a similar thing around here I'm still playing in an awful lot but I

300
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,960
I find that I'm gonna use my controller

301
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,380
to go back to the Japanese mixes.

302
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,800
But you know, I'm different.

303
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,620
I'm not like most of the people listening to this show.

304
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,980
I've played the hell out of those Japanese mixes.

305
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,560
You know, for me, this is controller,

306
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,880
good new controller plus best hits

307
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,720
is what this game is to me.

308
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,680
Yeah, that really is how I feel about it.

309
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,180
But the good thing about it is that

310
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,200
now I can have friends pick up, you know,

311
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,700
who are like, oh, that's neat,

312
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,240
but be so intimidated by it.

313
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,500
They've got access now to one

314
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,840
that's gonna work on their PlayStations,

315
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,160
they can practice at home,

316
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,120
and then come over and play the imports with me.

317
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,240
And it's gotten me back into the money

318
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,400
because having a new DDR arcade mix

319
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,280
is all fine and dandy and everything,

320
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,320
but I've got a new Beatmania in my house

321
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,360
that I've been playing the hell out of.

322
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,380
And as I went hunting the other day

323
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,760
to try to find my copy of 8th Style

324
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,880
and I'm actually considering going and buying 10th.

325
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,720
Awesome.

326
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,600
Well, let's leave it at that.

327
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,440
That sums it up.

328
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,540
Okay, more games.

329
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,740
Good thing it's a slow news week

330
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,160
because I've got a lot of games to talk about.

331
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,340
Kingdom Hearts 2.

332
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,620
I

333
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:28,320
Didn't like Kingdom Hearts 1. You know why I didn't like Kingdom Hearts 1 when we ship the camera the gummy ship

334
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:34,860
It's it's like Kingdom Hearts 1 was such a phenomenal idea and I but this is the weird thing. I'd love the story

335
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:41,880
I love the music. I love the cinema. I love everything about Kingdom Hearts except playing the game

336
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,060
That's my problem

337
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:50,860
Kingdom Hearts 2 it's all fixed. It is all fixed the camera not a problem for me anymore

338
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:58,080
more. Minimap, there now to help my, you know, 3D confused butt get through the levels. It's

339
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,400
phenomenal. Kingdom Hearts 2 is phenomenal. I cannot, I can't describe how incredible

340
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,920
I think this game is. I have not been sucked into a game this much, I don't think since

341
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,720
the Super Nintendo game. I have literally been playing with every spare moment I have

342
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,440
this week, I've been playing Kingdom Hearts 2.

343
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,080
I have noticed that Roxas doesn't annoy me as much in English as he does in Japanese.

344
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,120
I think what's great about it, and I know a lot of people have been bitching about that

345
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,200
three-hour prologue, I don't want to give any spoilers, but there's like a three-hour

346
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,720
prologue essentially, you have to play this game for three hours, three hours, fifteen

347
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,200
minutes until you see the title screen, the nice thing about it is for those of us that

348
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,120
didn't really play it the whole way through, Kingdom Hearts 1, it really does explain it

349
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,800
in a not cheesy manner, like it's kind of, I don't want to, I'm trying to do it without

350
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
spoilers, it tells it through flashbacks essentially.

351
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
It also ties in with Chains of Memories, that's the whole point.

352
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,260
Right, because Chains of Memories was more event- well, I knew actually quite a number of people who played it.

353
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,760
Uh-huh.

354
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:56,220
Um, I'm actually- my plan is to go back and play Chains of Memories, I just haven't had time to, but it's- it's a complete story.

355
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,700
I like that it sort of brings you back into it.

356
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,520
I mean, if you're not gonna play Kingdom Hearts 1, you're playing Kingdom Hearts, you just read the spoiler fact for Chains of Memories, read the spoiler fact for Kingdom Hearts,

357
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,320
and at least that way it'll kinda catch you up with the story, and then you can enjoy the game.

358
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,860
You've seen the ending of Kingdom Hearts, right?

359
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:22,160
I have seen the ending of Kingdom Hearts, because it's funny because the way I was introduced to Kingdom Hearts is I dated someone a long time ago who was really, really into it, and I kind of saw everything, you know, I got shown all of that, so, I don't know.

360
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,860
Did, um, did you see the final movie from, I did send you the final movie from the Deep Dive, didn't I?

361
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:38,560
Which was, with the international version in Japan, after Kingdom Hearts came out, they labeled it the Deep Dive, it had, like, the Sephiroth battle in it.

362
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,380
okay and on it had this extra movie file which part of it plays in the

363
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,520
prologue where with the

364
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,700
the nameless people at the end

365
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,860
okay so I'll show that to you later

366
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,900
but no I really recommend for people before you play

367
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,460
Kingdom Hearts 2 go back and get that movie off a deep dive because it really

368
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,060
does

369
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,860
tie in a lot more too familiarize yourself just even the slightest bit

370
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,000
with the Kingdom Hearts 1 story and I think you'll be okay

371
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,540
but yeah the game itself is is fantastic it's so

372
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,040
it's so deep there's so much to it like you know I love the

373
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,640
drive and the limits and I just fought this one battle not that long ago I was

374
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,100
doing

375
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,960
it's the Beauty and the Beast level and though the final battle you do and I

376
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,860
don't give away too much but the final battle you do in there is in the ballroom

377
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,620
but you're doing things like you using the chandelier to attack the monster and

378
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,340
stuff and it's just

379
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,980
it is I haven't been like that like whoa like at an RPG

380
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,200
since like I first saw a summon in Final Fantasy 7. Well I heard

381
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,440
like, what is it, the new system that they have where it's like this

382
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,160
action system where you hit the triangle button, depending on certain things that are going on,

383
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,320
it'll do kind of like the God of War, you know, where you'll do like a kind of

384
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,720
cinematic attacks and stuff.

385
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,120
Those are really impressive in the game.

386
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,200
Now, Kingdom Hearts does have a few things that are kind of,

387
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,080
you know, okay, here's the thing. If you don't like, like,

388
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,160
long cutscenes and a little bit of action in between,

389
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,880
That might bug you about Kingdom Hearts because it is a lot a lot of cutscenes that go on for a long time and sometimes

390
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,200
The battles in between are very short. So that might kind of annoy you a little bit

391
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:22,160
The other thing some of the portrayal of some of the characters really kind of didn't sit well with me like cipher in this game

392
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,840
I mean not that I'm a big Final Fantasy 8 fan, but no cipher was not cool and set sir

393
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,760
I was so excited when I heard that set sir was gonna be in this game, but he was kind of dorky

394
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,080
I didn't like Setzer in this game at all.

395
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,880
VV, however, was badass, and there's a part, again, I don't want to spoil it, but there's

396
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,280
a part where there's multiple VVs, and it's really cool.

397
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,280
So the whole game is made up of these little fanboy things, and if you watch Disney movies

398
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,800
at all, and I don't watch a lot of Disney movies, I've seen most of the big ones, or

399
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,720
if you play the Final Fantasy games at all, there's so many things in there to just make

400
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,920
you go, ee, ee, ee, you know?

401
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,500
So I highly recommend Kingdom Hearts II, although I think there's going to be some folks out

402
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,820
there listening to this going I know I wouldn't like Kingdom Hearts I don't

403
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,420
really like those action RPGs fine you probably won't like any more there's

404
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,300
nothing about this game that's really gonna win you over but I just think for

405
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,020
those that are into these types of games it's so in-depth there's so much to do

406
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,300
you probably already have your copy honestly so what else have I played this

407
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,900
week I didn't end that there's more I played I borrowed a need for speed

408
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:29,540
underground or most wanted underground ever that game is on Xbox 360 okay this

409
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,780
This is the weird thing about Most Wanted on 360.

410
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,080
It's like the showgirls of video games to me.

411
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,100
It's so bad, I can't stop playing it.

412
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,300
Now you see what I was dealing with for, what, three months at my house?

413
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,540
There is seriously nothing to like about that game.

414
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:53,340
The cutscenes are stupid, and washed out, and the graphics are crap compared to Ridge

415
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,020
Racer and even Full Auto and some of the other games I've played.

416
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,220
There is really not a lot to like about this game.

417
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,260
I can't stop playing it.

418
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,840
Until I got Kingdom Hearts, I could not stop playing that game.

419
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
I don't know what it is.

420
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,600
Now to play Devil's advocate here.

421
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,080
The cutscenes, they're done and it's supposed to be like that.

422
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
The washed out.

423
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,240
Because it's supposed to be kind of like comic book-ish.

424
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,220
And I thought the cutscenes were actually pretty cool.

425
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,160
There were too many of them, granted.

426
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,320
The graphics weren't that bad, but they weren't much better than the Xbox version.

427
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,600
And I don't know, I'd never really gotten the need for speed, but I thought the game

428
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,800
was okay looking.

429
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,840
I liked the whole Fast and the Furious thing.

430
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,320
I thought you could totally tell it was an upgraded Xbox game, but you could totally

431
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
tell.

432
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Okay, that is true.

433
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,500
You could totally tell that.

434
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,600
Here's the funny thing I have to laugh about.

435
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,120
You know how the cutscenes are done this?

436
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,160
Well you know that game coming out, Ace Combat Zero, the Belkan War?

437
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,560
Imagine that style of cutscenes with Top Gun.

438
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,240
basically but the game is cool so I don't know I don't know why I can't stop

439
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,700
playing I haven't played any of my racing games on Xbox 360 nearly as much

440
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,560
as I played and it's weird because like rich racer is obviously a superior game

441
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,580
yet I keep playing this one I don't know why I'll just have to take it back and

442
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,660
let you borrow it no no no you're not taking no you can take it until I beat

443
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,860
Kingdom Hearts all right let's let's go to chat room because I'm sure chat room

444
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,100
some stuff they want to say on these games. Legend of Zaku, Kingdom Hearts 2

445
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,260
equals makes fanboys cream in their pants. You know what though? There's

446
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,660
things here that not just for fanboys. I think there's a lot that's... I placed a

447
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,780
revival in the chat room. Did you? Yeah, Kingdom Hearts 2 is fangirl fodder.

448
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:40,660
It's both. So much fangirl fodder. It's both. Let's see, also in the chat room, Rini

449
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:46,460
says, VV is the friggin win. Absolutely, but I haven't gotten to the Tron level

450
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,780
yet so let I'm not I'm gonna hold back on the friggin win I it better not let

451
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,140
me down Tron level better not let me down I've seen the Tron level it won't

452
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,040
let you down thank is a tree get to play light cycles yes you get freakin light

453
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,780
cycles but the light cycle part actually is not as cool Wow but you do get light

454
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:09,420
cycles that is great no you're talking about all the the

455
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,220
yaoi DJ poo eater in the chat room which by the way is one of my favorite

456
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,480
DJ Pooh Eater in chat says, nothing wrong with the fanboys, nope, nothing at all.

457
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,660
You know what, everybody's fanboy about something.

458
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:25,660
For some people it's football, basketball, for some people it's crocheting, for some

459
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,660
people it's Kingdom Hearts.

460
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,780
You know they were saying that they're going to announce at E3 this year that they're continuing

461
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:36,540
the Kingdom Hearts series but in a different way, something, definitely it's something

462
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:41,260
they're going to keep making games, but they're thinking about expanding it in different ways,

463
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,020
maybe not like Chains of Memories but

464
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,860
god I'm hoping... You know what?

465
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,620
Do you know what we were theorizing when we were playing Kingdom Hearts outside? Some of the

466
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,560
boys were over, we were talking about it.

467
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,460
Here's the thing.

468
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,580
They say they want to do something different with Kingdom Hearts.

469
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:59,060
Square Enix says they're working on a new MMO.

470
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,780
Would Kingdom Hearts not make the coolest MMO? You know that would totally get me back

471
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,760
to play online.

472
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,200
I don't think that's going to be what happens because, one,

473
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,180
uh... they're working on something else, not that for

474
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,660
an MMO cuz I've I remember hearing about it like last year I know I heard that

475
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,980
they're doing something else but I mean it's just my brain couldn't help but go

476
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,880
there it's like oh it's just something about that seems oh so right can you

477
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,860
imagine like and the MMO could be updated with new Disney and square look

478
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:33,060
I see them doing an anime series or no ABC I rather see yeah I actually I'm

479
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,220
very surprised they haven't already did you know there's actually Kingdom Hearts

480
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,920
manga they could do a CG like anime because this game I mean basically

481
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:46,160
cel-shaded CG anyways and it looks really good I mean it looks very

482
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,640
realistic to you know true to the animated series that they're pulling

483
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,840
from but um oh my god it would make one hell of a kick-ass movie it would be one

484
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,880
franchise Disney would you know rock with because it appeals to everybody

485
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,780
that's what's kind of cool about the game too because if you know most people

486
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,620
that haven't played it they're like oh cool King you know Disney characters you

487
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,940
you know, let their kids play it and then it's actually got a really good storyline

488
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,940
to go with it.

489
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,620
You know what's funny is the girl at Toys R Us was so obviously new when I bought the

490
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,580
game and she was like, what's the big deal about this game?

491
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:22,020
A bunch of people have been coming in here today and I'm like, imagine Disney but like

492
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:28,700
with a more mature storyline to it and you get to interact with it and be in it.

493
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,100
That's the great thing about this game and she was kind of like, hmm, sounds interesting,

494
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,260
know but it's kind of interesting to try and explain Kingdom Hearts and I'm

495
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:41,980
thinking well you get to interact with Winnie the Pooh and Mulan I can't the

496
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,060
games are a lot more hardcore than that I know I know it's it's but it's so hard

497
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:52,700
to explain okay let's see more comments from chat room more more more dirty thief

498
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:58,620
theorizes Kingdom Hearts 3 could be a theatrical sequel for the movies for GS

499
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:03,660
S191 says, I would be okay with a Kingdom Hearts MMO, but do a damn true sequel to Super

500
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,660
Mario RPG first.

501
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,580
Seriously, definitely.

502
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,820
This is what we need.

503
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,500
Screw this Paper Mario crap.

504
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,700
I am done with Paper Mario.

505
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,580
I want a goddamn Super Mario RPG 2.

506
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,220
Just remake the whole damn thing.

507
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:23,740
Dirty Thief in our chatroom says, everyone's going to be a Keyblade holder if you do a

508
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,580
Kingdom Hearts MMO.

509
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,580
Not necessarily true.

510
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,780
like you notice how in Kingdom Hearts 1 and in this one there's always these

511
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,680
like gangs of kids that hang out together I think there's something you

512
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,620
could do with that and not necessarily everybody has to be a Keyblade holder it

513
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,100
could be like you know it could be all about adventuring together with friends

514
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,500
because that's how I noticed Kingdom Hearts 1 what I did play if you know

515
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,980
hearts 1 2 kind of both open up with that same theme adventuring with your

516
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,500
friends and that's like a big theme through the games too so I think it

517
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,500
would be a perfect MMO but what do I know I don't design them Tiger Claw says

518
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,180
hey how about a Super Mario MMO huh dirty thief says he has a way to

519
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:08,420
explain Kingdom Hearts you like Disney you like Final Fantasy play it well said

520
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:14,460
alright let's get into tonight's news we actually do have some news first off a

521
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,820
disclaimer ok April Fools was yesterday and I hate April Fools day April Fools

522
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,560
What happened to April Fools being a day instead of a month?

523
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,880
April Fools is actually against my religion, so I don't really practice April Fools.

524
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,100
You'll notice on Orange Lawn's radio we did no April Fools gag.

525
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,380
There will be no gag in tonight's program, I'm sorry.

526
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:38,140
We did a gag last year, but it was stupid and obvious, and we thought about doing them

527
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,220
this year, but then we realized, or at least I was realizing...

528
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,020
We're just too lazy and procrastinating too much.

529
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,380
In the time it takes to set up an April Fools prank, I could be doing something more constructive

530
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,700
for the website in the long term.

531
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,700
I like the one we did on DDR Freak.

532
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,700
The one where all the text was translated into gibberish for a day or whatever?

533
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,700
We changed it into Rot13.

534
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,700
Honestly, I have to admit, as it's been with the past three years of the DDR Freak April Fools prank,

535
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,700
I click, I go to the site, I roll my eyes, I go somewhere else.

536
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,700
That's been my April Fools visits.

537
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,700
I was laxing my moderator duties yesterday.

538
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,700
Everybody was.

539
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,700
To be honest, I think the Blizzard ones have been the best.

540
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,700
Blizzard has had some good ones.

541
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,460
Panda Express or Pandaren Express whatever it was in their game. Did you see this one?

542
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:28,060
The new alliance class is the WISP. No, not the WISP. It was, what was it, Burger Craft.

543
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:32,700
Oh yeah. Their new fast food cheat that they're gonna. That was hilarious. I think that's

544
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,420
great. What were some other great April Fools pranks played out there on the internet? Game

545
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:45,220
Facts telling you not to cheat. Actually, my favorite one, another site that I moderate

546
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:51,580
on as gorillas unofficial and that was actually my favorite prank and I I knew

547
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,360
it was a prank when I saw it and I went and I went to the sources and hey was

548
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,460
this prank yeah it is but don't tell anyone so um they posted a perfectly

549
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,740
photoshopped article well written for a music match magazine which doesn't

550
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,060
really exist in the UK uh-huh saying that uh for anyone who keeps up with the

551
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,300
whole gorillas fandom saying that Paula was rejoining gorillas and that noodle

552
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,900
was out of the picture for a while and I was like oh yeah and I loved I just

553
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,660
loved watching everybody going oh my god oh my god oh my god and I'm sitting

554
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,780
there going haha you know what's funny is I read about that on the Wikipedia

555
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,260
like Wikipedia had a giant list of every April Fools prank on the internet

556
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:33,120
yesterday and that was on there was girls an official prank I loved slash

557
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:40,020
dots prank they turned the site pink and was like you know my little pony just

558
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:45,380
nerdy stuff that was cute I actually nobody got my prank because people I

559
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,640
guess believed it and didn't comment on it I know I knew it was a prank the one

560
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,420
in your LJ I said that I was leaving my job next month to be a like a writer for

561
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,980
a holistic magazine and you know what my reaction was to that I went I read it I

562
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,780
rolled my eyes and went to the next story I didn't even read it from two

563
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:07,060
years ago which was when I said I was moving to Washington because you'd

564
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,340
threatened to do it before.

565
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:13,820
Because Dan's been wanting to move us to Washington now for like the past five years.

566
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,060
The very first episode of this program you said something about moving to Washington

567
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,060
and that hasn't happened yet.

568
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,060
You can't go, you have this show, you can't go.

569
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,420
But I can do a spinoff in Washington.

570
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:27,060
A spinoff would be called It's Raining Here.

571
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,320
It's Raining Rain.

572
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,340
We should though bring up our announcement.

573
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,340
Oh yeah good.

574
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,340
We have an announcement.

575
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,340
This is not a fool's print.

576
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:44,660
real honest to God or whoever you believe in announcement we are doing two

577
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:50,020
panels at Fauna May this year in San Jose I'll be getting dates and

578
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,220
everything we'll be putting it up on our website Memorial Day weekend right it is

579
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:57,700
Memorial Day weekend last weekend in May mm-hmm we will be there with two panels

580
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,860
one for sure is on podcasting we'll be doing full-on presentations I will be

581
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:08,020
cosplaying I might too I I have some ideas on what I want to do I am actually

582
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:13,020
I am actually taking a suggestion by one of our longtime listeners DJ run mass and

583
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,960
I am cosplaying tamari from Naruto like everybody else in the universe freaking

584
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,380
cosplays Naruto I want I have an idea for cosplay I'll tell you off here I

585
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,860
think it's easy and I think it's cute and we could all do it but then I had

586
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:29,580
another idea because I know him who came over gave us resident evil stars air

587
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,400
or soft guns with laser sights.

588
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,280
Dan and I have been shooting each other all day.

589
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,860
It's been fantastic.

590
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,520
So I'm sort of thinking about reviving the Jill costume,

591
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
but I'm not sure.

592
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,200
Awesome.

593
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,720
OK, we're about like 40 minutes into the show.

594
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,160
We haven't even gotten to the first story yet,

595
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,080
so we have a game movie.

596
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,800
Video games?

597
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,600
What the hell?

598
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Fonami's going to be happy with it.

599
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,480
So we're doing podcasting and what?

600
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,820
The other one is just gaming?

601
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,320
Gaming.

602
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,440
E3 wrap up or something?

603
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:49,920
Yeah.

604
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,880
I don't know, something like that.

605
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,560
Yeah, it will be right after E3, so yeah, that'll be.

606
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,800
OK, so check that out.

607
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,560
It'll be awesome.

608
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,240
We'll be there.

609
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,000
We'll probably be giving stuff out, too,

610
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,800
We will be doing, I know for sure that our panel, one of them is on Saturday, I'll be

611
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,600
getting official time as soon as they're given to me by my contact.

612
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Sweet.

613
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
We'll post all that info on the website.

614
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,640
Thank you to Fonomay for inviting us and letting us ruin your con.

615
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,560
No, no, no, no, Rob is Manfay.

616
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,560
Manfay's been done.

617
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,920
What, is that something in the chat room there?

618
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,040
23 Magus brought that up.

619
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,040
I'm not gonna be Manfay.

620
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,680
Are there any cosplayers, Man-Fei is this guy who's not very attractive, cosplaying

621
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,320
Fei from Cowboy Bebop.

622
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Okay.

623
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
Yeah, it doesn't work.

624
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,360
Look, Rama's offering to send me the Black Mage costume I wore at Katsu-Khan.

625
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,260
Here's the thing, if you listen to the first 30 minutes of the show, you know where my

626
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,860
fanboyism is right now.

627
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,760
So fill in the blanks, you can guess what I probably have planned for the cast of OLR.

628
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
You're great.

629
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,160
Alright, nope, that's, yep, you're gonna be the duck.

630
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,720
I'm kidding. That's not it. That's not it. I'll tell you later. All right

631
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,920
Everybody thought this was a joke, but one up calm is saying no, this is not a joke

632
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,080
This was not our April Fool's prank this we are picking this up from legit sources

633
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:13,320
And that is Final Fantasy 13 is going to be a surprise at maze e3

634
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:19,160
There's going to be a brief teaser video and confirmation from the publisher that the RPG will be a PlayStation 3

635
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,160
exclusive and of course now one up published this on March 30th of 06

636
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,240
people were saying it was an early April Fool's joke but one up and in fact even

637
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,120
Square Enix came out and said don't forget that people like to play April

638
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,280
Fool's pranks around this time of year but one up published another story that

639
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,780
said no your Square Enix is trying to deflect we we have inside sources says

640
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:48,560
this is gonna happen and that was followed up by Game Informer really I'm

641
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:58,560
While there have been numerous rumors about Final Fantasy XIII, Square Enix has never released any information about the title.

642
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,560
The recent online article stating that the title will be exclusive for PS3 and Shona A3 is not based on any official information obtained by us.

643
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,800
I hope the readers will remember April Fool's Day is tomorrow

644
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,600
and may print and many print and online outlets pull pranks every year

645
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,920
before they get their hopes up or before they get their hopes crushed by a joke.

646
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,800
So still rumor. And 1up.com ran a follow-up story that said

647
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,480
nope Square Enix is just trying to deflect we we have inside sources says

648
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,520
this is the real deal.

649
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:34,520
Now I think logically we all know Final Fantasy 13 is going to happen on

650
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:40,280
PlayStation 3 because let's see you had 7 8 9 on PlayStation 10 11 12 on

651
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,840
PlayStation 2 13 14 15 on PlayStation 3 seems pretty logical we also had the

652
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,840
first three on the NES and the second three on the SNES exactly right they've

653
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,960
always 3 3 3 okay the only big shock was that they moved from Nintendo to Sony

654
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,520
but that's years old news and the crap that comes out on the stupid you know

655
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,960
and 10-2, I'm not even counting any of that.

656
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,440
Not counting any of that. It's inevitable we're getting Final Fantasy 13 on

657
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,640
PlayStation 3.

658
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,760
It would be hard to talk me out of that notion.

659
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,560
Well, here's what the problem is. The surprise is, 12's not even out on shelves over here yet,

660
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,840
so to announce 13 seems a little...

661
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,720
Well, here's what I don't like. I don't like people ruining surprises like this, for one, because, yeah,

662
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,840
of course they're always gonna have something that they're surprising everybody with. Hell, we

663
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,920
probably know stuff that we can surprise people with, you know, that I haven't heard about yet, but

664
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,320
Obviously, you can't say anything about it until E3, so...

665
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,040
Yeah. Well, we'll see. Of course,

666
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,040
there's nothing else to be said about this game so far, just that E3, they're

667
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,120
gonna show it. That it will come out before Final Fantasy 12 will in the United States.

668
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,480
You know what, though? It makes sense, because what else is Square gonna show

669
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,160
this year?

670
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,440
They just released Kingdom Hearts. I don't think 11 has any life left in it,

671
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,860
and their expansion is coming out. I think it'll be the last one.

672
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,840
Treasures of Aht-Ur-Gon. Sorry, I'm gonna get hate mail. All that crap that they showed

673
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:06,200
last year that never came out. I don't wanna get hate mail from the Final Fantasy 11 fans.

674
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,360
I'm just saying I think this next expansion is the last one. I don't see them doing another

675
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,520
one after this, because they've done three expansions now. Because Rise of the Zillert

676
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,120
technically was an expansion, we just got it for free here in the US. I bet one more

677
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,140
will be coming out and that's about it. I think a new MMO will replace it. That's just

678
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,140
That's my thoughts.

679
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,140
Alright, anyway.

680
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:28,300
Now, I know some buddies of mine were in town this weekend and one thing they did today

681
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,060
was go shopping for an Xbox 360.

682
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,660
And why would today be the day for that, Loki?

683
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,860
Today would be the day because everyone has been hoarding them up because all those increased

684
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:42,940
shipments, you know, Best Buy and Target and stores like such were doing their, I guess,

685
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,220
third launch of the system.

686
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:51,680
Best Buy's had 60 systems per store and I think it was similar over at Target and whatnot.

687
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,120
they're out there you can find him now finally so I one of our and he'll be

688
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,480
here for part B he ran out for a little bit they went somewhere but Miklotov

689
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,440
was in town this weekend he went to Best Buy this morning he they're crazy they

690
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,960
drove by it like 3 a.m. to make sure there wasn't gonna be a line and then

691
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,000
they came back went to bed and went like right before it open and sure enough he

692
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,200
got there and got a premium system and he said they had 80 in stock they still

693
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,720
have some there right now he called a little bit ago because I think he wanted

694
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,380
to take it back because he was afraid of something was wrong with it I don't know

695
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,560
I haven't been following the whole thing I'll grill him in part B but um yeah

696
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,280
they apparently still have a bunch in stock and it's not just best by doing

697
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,200
this there's GameStop was gonna release a bunch today as well GameStop had some

698
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,180
EB and I think I think somebody else was doing this too. I overheard GameStop earlier this week

699
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:46,560
when I picked up Far Cry that they were gonna be having more in so that's great

700
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,920
I mean that's great because now we'll see some better games come out because

701
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,180
Because some of the publishers have been pushing back their games because they're afraid there's

702
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,680
not many units out there that sell their games.

703
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,040
So that's why the whole Splinter Cell double agent got pushed back this September.

704
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,480
Does this mean the shortage is over of Xbox 360s?

705
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
This is it?

706
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
The end?

707
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,480
It's getting better.

708
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,480
Let me put it that way.

709
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,480
Okay.

710
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
I know our company is selling them in May.

711
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,040
We're going to have them for sure in May in all of our warehouses.

712
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,560
So I get them like $5 cheaper than retail.

713
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,560
I'm just asking, will we declare the shortage officially over now?

714
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,820
When 80 Xbox 360s are sitting there in Best Buy and there's still some on the shelf halfway

715
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,940
through the day, does that mean the shortage is over?

716
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:29,980
I would say, well think about it this way, they're going to be getting maybe about half

717
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:34,660
that next week, so they're going to start getting them regularly on the shelves, so

718
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,900
if you don't have one yet now you can probably get one.

719
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,580
And it's a good time too because you're starting to get, the games are starting to slow down

720
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:46,620
a little bit, it's kind of dip in the year, and there's plenty of good titles out right

721
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:51,460
now. March was a great month, so go for it.

722
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,500
We're going to move on here, keep it moving. Now take this with a grain of salt as you

723
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:01,580
should every story tonight because somebody could be playing an April Fools prank on us.

724
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,160
This is one I've kind of seen going back and forth a little bit because I think I saw another

725
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,900
story dispute this, but there was a story floating around the internet this week where

726
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:16,180
Iwata over at Nintendo is saying that the simultaneous global revolution launch is not

727
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:21,200
gonna be likely quote we don't think it's necessary to do the simultaneous

728
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,520
worldwide launch simply because others are doing this you and you know Sony of

729
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,080
course is doing this big thing where they're gonna do a worldwide launch and

730
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,840
they're supposed to be region free and all that stuff

731
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:36,680
Nintendo saying I mean we don't need to do the same thing so could that mean

732
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,000
that the revolution comes out in Japan this year and we still have to wait I

733
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,320
hope not I think it's gonna be out in both markets for the end of the year are

734
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,980
Are we talking two week difference?

735
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,300
Month difference?

736
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,140
Who knows?

737
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,060
I think they'll launch it worldwide

738
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,380
if they have the units to do it.

739
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,100
I mean, because why not?

740
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,260
But if they don't, big deal.

741
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,180
I think the unfortunate thing is that

742
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,700
some of the countries are probably gonna get the shaft

743
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,940
that usually tend to get the shaft

744
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,660
when it comes to these launches,

745
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,620
like Australia, sorry guys.

746
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,020
You know, some of those other countries

747
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:17,260
that aren't the U.S., Japan, and Europe, and even Europe gets the shaft half the time,

748
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,540
probably aren't going to see this at the same time, which is, you know, too bad.

749
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,060
It's unfortunate.

750
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,340
We'll see, we'll see.

751
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,420
Alright,

752
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,940
let's go over to Loki, who has another follow-up story there on the Revolution.

753
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:36,140
Yeah, of course, you know, kind of tying in with the whole Revolution being cheaper

754
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,060
than the

755
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,480
competition out there,

756
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:57,480
The Revolution first party games are going to be seeing a price tag of basically $50 or less, which, you know, is good and all, but I don't think it's too impressive because if you look at, you know, the first party 360 games, those are also $50, so I don't know.

757
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:14,480
Hopefully that will kind of start the trend of games being a little bit cheaper, but since, you know, obviously the development costs are going to be less than, you know, developing for the 360 and the PlayStation 3, I could definitely see them having, you know, cheaper games.

758
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,480
Yeah, I mean it would be kind of stupid to release the least expensive system and then the most expensive games

759
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:25,880
So I think this kind of makes sense if you know and Nintendo's I think trying to affirm that yes

760
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,680
we're gonna be the cheapest system when this thing releases and

761
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:35,200
You know, I think their games have to match that is that the games have to stay competitive. So but you're right

762
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:41,920
I mean, it's not that competitive if they'd come out and said no game under 40 or even $30 now, that would be whoa

763
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:49,440
I'll be something else. In not so much console gaming news but going on to a

764
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,160
certainly big gaming event that's happening this month right around Dark

765
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:58,360
Sakura's birthday. Yes. We have the Silent Hill movie coming out right? Yes there's

766
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,920
actually a little bit of talk from Roger Avery who is the author of the

767
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:08,880
screenplay for the Silent Hill movie. He has basically tried to give his

768
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,300
assurance says that it will be very much based around the actual games which a

769
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:19,040
lot of us who've been looking into this have heard him say already but he did

770
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,680
speak to a reporter in Hollywood recently and is quoted saying Christoph

771
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:30,160
Christoph Ganz and I knew how passionate the video game fans are for Silent Hill

772
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,840
at the minimum we didn't want to piss them off we want to make this movie for

773
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:41,580
them he also mentioned that it isn't always that way the with video game

774
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:46,760
tie-ins another quote from him says Hollywood executives are very quick to

775
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,980
throw out the source material of the game doom kills me this was one of the

776
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,280
movies I wanted to do so badly I met with them early on and I looked at the

777
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,880
original script and asked them where's the doom in this well the doom in this

778
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,280
will be the box don't you remember the first-person shooter part well at any

779
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:10,560
rate I do also have a UK release date for the movie it will be out on April

780
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,560
25th well that's not much of a delay not much of a delay at all ours is the 21st

781
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:21,600
oh that's that's nothing for standard movie delays so awesome you know I've

782
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,200
said this on the show before I'll say it again I think when we were lucky enough

783
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,640
to go to Konami gamers day a few months ago to have a Kiriyama Oka sitting next

784
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:36,540
two, Christophe Gans, introducing the trailer together, saying, we are bringing this to

785
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,900
you, and Kiryamoka, of course, being the producer of the last two Silent Hill games and doing

786
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,660
all the music for all of them, and Christophe Gans being the director, I think that spoke

787
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:48,000
volumes right there, that they're working together, they're presenting this together,

788
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,660
and I don't think you ever saw that happen with previous games, you know, sure, maybe

789
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,140
they say nice things about each other before the movie came out, and then after the movie

790
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,180
comes out, they all distance themselves from each other and blame each other for the movie

791
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,180
sucking.

792
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:03,500
like explain you know the different differences between obviously this

793
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,820
movie is based on the first and third games and I like how they explain the

794
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:11,820
differences between why the main character is a female instead of male and

795
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:16,180
stuff like that and it made a lot of sense and it's not like oh well we did

796
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:20,300
this because uh we get this actress or you know we did this because we wanted

797
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:25,820
explosions or you know something stupid so I definitely am confident that this

798
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:31,420
will finally be a Sean Bean movie you get the sense that this movie is a

799
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:37,620
little more Japanese than any other game movie we've gotten yet the trailer is

800
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:42,460
like freaking totally Silent Hill I mean I can't see it as anything but it's sort

801
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,940
of like Silent Hill alternate universe you know what's the problem is now is

802
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,860
that the bar is so high for this movie that it better rock or we're gonna come

803
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,940
in on the show that next week and trash it and pick every little thing that's

804
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:57,260
wrong with it don't let us down guys all right then again we might be a little

805
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:02,820
bit more mellow since it'll be the day after that's true I'll be hungover

806
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:08,140
Loki you have a follow-up relating to Silent Hill yes of course a tie-in with

807
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,980
the movie release Konami's announced a few things of course he previously

808
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:16,940
announced Silent Hill experience that one's actually has a date now it's gonna

809
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:23,900
to be coming out, well maybe a little bit after the movie, on May 28th.

810
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:29,340
Which is actually, if I remember correctly, the same day as the Metal Gear Solid Digital

811
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,340
Comic.

812
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,180
Which, same week there.

813
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,300
So that's kind of cool.

814
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:38,580
And that's basically a bunch of digital comics, some music, and some backstory to some of

815
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,580
the Silent Hill games.

816
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:42,740
Kind of tying it all together nicely for the PSP.

817
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:47,420
And then, of course, also announced is the Silent Hill collection for the Playstation

818
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:54,060
2, which is including games 2 through 4, and that's slated for April 13th, about a week

819
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,900
or so before the movie.

820
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,020
You know what we need is the Game Boy one.

821
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,780
I keep forgetting about that one.

822
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,060
Because we never got it over here.

823
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,580
Or maybe it would be a bonus or something.

824
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,520
Could be like a bonus unlockable, who knows.

825
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,380
I don't know. I haven't actually found the translation of it

826
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,080
outside of FAQ format.

827
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,560
I've been hunting. Speaking of movies, you know I got invited to go see Stay Alive this

828
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,320
weekend.

829
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,720
I'm sorry. I turned it down.

830
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,000
Yeah, I know I do the show on video games and stuff, but I just really

831
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,520
don't want to see it.

832
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,720
Even though somebody gave it a not so bad review. Didn't we get a not so bad review in the

833
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,600
mailbag last week?

834
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,920
I still just... I'll wait for Netflix. It's not something I can make myself go see.

835
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,920
Alright, somebody was mentioning it in chatroom right now, so I just wanted to drop that.

836
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,700
Moving on to other gaming news, Mario Brothers DS, you know, it was announced a little while

837
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:50,920
ago and they keep pushing it back, well guess what, got pushed back one more time, May 21st

838
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,760
over on the game's homepage is when they say this game's coming out.

839
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,360
Now that's not too bad of a delay because it was only a week.

840
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:03,660
However, now people are theorizing that, hmm, could this be because the DS Lite is being

841
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,200
positioned somewhere around here because of course Super Mario is probably going

842
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,540
to be the next big DS game after this Tetris Metroid combo we got so maybe the

843
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:16,500
light is being positioned to be launched at the same time. That would be a good

844
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,420
packing game with the DS Lite. A very good packing game for the DS Lite so

845
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,760
maybe this is why the repositioning is happening. Of course we won't know the

846
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,780
answers until E3 which is kind of a running theme across most of our stories

847
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:32,340
over the next couple months. Everything will be... it's like one of those movies

848
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:36,380
They're one of those games with a really contorted plot everything is explained at the end

849
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:41,100
Everything will be explained at e3 and if it's not explained we're gonna be pissed

850
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,620
Oh, yeah

851
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:46,900
I forgot to mention and I was reminded by illusion here the other thing they announced was they're doing a Silent Hill

852
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:52,860
Game for the PSP not the Silent Hill experience on top of that. That's right there. I had read that too

853
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,860
They're gonna be do like a whole new game on the PSP

854
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,660
The rumor is that supposed to be a remake of the first one

855
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,100
I don't know maybe you remake of the first one with the characters from the movie

856
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:06,580
I've been actually hearing about a possibility of them doing the movie version of the game

857
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,340
Which is ironic because I did that as my homework in illustrator

858
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:14,660
Did and you also posted a recent homework thing to our forums, huh?

859
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,620
Like a little scary little thing that made me jump out of my chair when I clicked on it because that's right

860
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:25,980
In the chat room I did for my flash homework we were supposed to animate a banner

861
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:30,700
so what I did is not a banner but animate an ad so I took the Silent Hill

862
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:37,440
movie poster and made it pulse in like a dark dried blood color and with this

863
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,680
rain effect over it and when you click it the picture turns red and it plays

864
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,500
part of the Silent Hill theme and pulls up the website so when you start working

865
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:49,340
on a new website I'm actually gonna be doing a splash for us um within the next

866
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:52,780
couple of months because my spring break is actually next month very cool you

867
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,780
know I'm excited to hear Silent Hill's coming to the PSP because I think that's

868
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,420
That's one of those franchises you can't really do on the DS as well as you can on the PSP.

869
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:03,460
I think the PSP's technology with the movies and everything, I think it'll lend itself

870
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:08,140
a lot better to the Silent Hill franchise than the DS would.

871
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,940
That's me tossing the PSP fans that say I rip on the PSP too much.

872
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,100
That's me tossing you guys a bone there.

873
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,380
I think Silent Hill will kick butt and I don't think they could do it on the DS as well.

874
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,780
We don't rip on the PSP fans.

875
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,780
We have a whole page dedicated to the PSP.

876
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,780
That's true.

877
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,780
I know.

878
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,780
A whole website.

879
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:31,180
weeks ago they were getting vicious. Alright, anyway, now the 360 has kind of gotten a cold

880
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:36,260
shoulder in Japan. People kind of don't care. But what's Microsoft going to do to try and

881
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:41,320
make people care? They're going to do over. Can we get a do over? They're going to relaunch

882
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:48,900
the 360. Mulligan in Japan on, well the rumor date right now is June 29th. It's supposed

883
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:54,500
coincide with many of the new games coming out, especially one of my favorites, Chrome

884
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:59,820
Hounds is going to be coming around that time. But some better games will be out by then.

885
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:04,900
I don't see how you can actually do over a launch. You can't just pretend it doesn't

886
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,900
happen. I mean, it's like, what are you going to do? Put more systems out there and go,

887
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:15,620
hey look, we're here still. Well, I've heard of CDs being relaunched, like when there's

888
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:19,180
a really popular song on the CD that gets in like a movie or something, then they'll

889
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,820
re-release the CD, but they'll call the CD by the name of the song that was in the movie

890
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:27,260
and give it new artwork, maybe that's what they'll do with the Xbox, it'll be like, it'll

891
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:33,420
come in a prettier box, and it'll be like, Xbox 360 International Edition, now with,

892
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,740
I don't know, free stickers or something, I don't know, new faceplate, I don't know.

893
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:43,700
Super Japanese Happy Console! Play all your favorite games! I, I, I don't know. I don't

894
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:50,780
think so I don't think it'll be that bad we'll see what happens 60 I choose you

895
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,240
all right since we're traveling abroad right now

896
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,260
dark Sakura likes to travel the world from her computer and tell us what's

897
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:01,200
going on in the UK for our buddies over there overseas what's up I am so

898
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:06,360
friggin international um there's been an update to the world of Warcraft

899
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:12,120
downloader um basically we've had a bunch of players saying a blizzard uh

900
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:23,920
no so they actually did a change with a patch oh 1.10 that's meaning to the

901
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,600
downloader will run constantly even if the program is closed oh so there's a

902
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:37,600
There's a quote on here from one of the World of Warcraft players from the forums.

903
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:42,100
So I was playing Wednesday morning after installing the 1.0 patch and in the middle of playing

904
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:46,600
my firewall says the Blizzard Downloader is still trying to make an outgoing connection.

905
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,600
Yeah, stealing bandwidth, not good.

906
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,600
Interesting.

907
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,600
Now I heard about the new patch, I mean that was a worldwide thing of course.

908
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,600
But of course, you know, things that happened in the UK and picked up over there often happen over here.

909
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,180
um... but uh... i didn't know about that that's interesting basically they're

910
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,840
doing that they're taking the bit torrent method

911
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,360
right at the end they've done that before but

912
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,080
they didn't run in the background that sounds like the difference there it was

913
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,840
it what you knew when it was running

914
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,080
as interesting well basically when you're done downloading the patch the

915
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,380
connection is going to stay open so that you can share with everybody else

916
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,440
you are becoming a part of

917
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,240
the whole

918
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,800
network

919
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,140
uh...

920
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,580
but

921
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:29,620
you know all you're sending out is the the patch content but a lot of people

922
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:34,340
were saying that you know part of the agreement is that they did they never

923
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:38,820
once agreed to offer up their services to blizzard they're paying blizzard for

924
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:44,500
their services instead so blizzard updated their downloader with an option

925
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,460
that you can make it stop running in the background you can turn it off if you

926
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:55,340
want to hmm interesting but yeah you know I honestly I think that it's it was

927
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:59,220
a very poor practice on their part, where I understand the logic behind it.

928
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,220
Especially with such a huge patch.

929
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,380
It's not really...

930
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,380
I don't recall seeing anything to that effect in the user agreement.

931
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:09,300
I mean, I'll look back through it again, but I really don't believe that...

932
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:14,020
And you allow your bandwidth to be used for Blizzard's own purposes.

933
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:18,020
But to Blizzard's credit, they've been making a lot of mistakes this year, because I can't

934
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:22,980
help but think back to the political Lee-ish issue from a few months ago.

935
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,420
But they've been pretty good about coming up with really intelligent fixes, not always

936
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,740
the fastest way, but at least they fixed their mistakes, unlike some companies.

937
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,460
So I've got to hand it to them there.

938
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,460
What else?

939
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:39,860
We also have a demo for Blazing Angels on the PC.

940
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:49,440

that the chat room cool and the last one that I have is

951
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:06,220
Nintendo is offering basically their European audience a chance to air their

952
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:15,240
grievances basically there was such a long delay for Animal Crossing wild

953
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:24,040
world a lot of people got very upset over this in fact there was a website

954
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:28,960
opened up called Nintendo of Europe watch to basically go over a lot of the

955
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,720
problems including a Hall of Fame a Hall of Shame for good and bad release

956
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:39,600
schedules there actually and there were a few games that you know they mentioned

957
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:43,720
that made it over there before they made it here first like another code which I

958
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:51,720
have been waiting on for a while but there are delays from days to months you

959
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,320
know so many and even with the release schedules that I've announced there's

960
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,160
been lots of different changes going between them I seem to recall reading

961
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:04,760
When I checked out that site that like Wario were twisted was just coming out over there and like that game came out here

962
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,620
Like last year, I mean that was a horrendous delay

963
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:12,320
I don't know what caused that but they they they didn't get that game for like six nine months after we got it

964
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:18,560
That's which is too bad because it's kind of a cool game, but there's you know more interesting stuff on the DS now

965
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,060
But I would I would though check out that site in Nintendo of Europe watch

966
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:28,500
because it's a place to I mean it's basically giving people an opportunity

967
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:34,420
to voice their concerns over the massive changes in and even if you're in the US

968
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:40,060
you can see just how good you have it yeah yeah we really they've been pretty

969
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:44,780
much on on the level with us but then again we can go to Washington and knock

970
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:48,740
on their door but you know at the same time we sometimes feel like we have to

971
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:52,260
wait for Japan to get it then we'll get it then Europe gets it you know we're

972
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:57,140
We're not we're not on the top of the ladder either. No, but it of course it depends on the type of game

973
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:02,460
Because of course we get some games before Japan does just it all depends on who's making it. Yep. All right, and

974
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:10,540
The last bit of news is release dates going over the upcoming release dates for this week

975
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:17,960
All these are going to be on the seventh. We have Def Jam fight for New York. Hooray

976
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:23,900
Iron Warriors we have Lara Croft Tomb Raider Legend, Magna Carta on PS2,

977
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:32,680
Painkiller Hell Wars on Xbox, Plarium Advance on a GBA, Top Spin 2, and also

978
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:37,560
they're coming up the following week is Auto Assault on PC Dragon Quest 8.

979
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,560
Oh about time. Yeah that's a good one. Sims 2, Family Fun Stuff, Mega Man Battle Network 5.

980
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:47,040
Didn't Def Jam Fight for New York come out here like a year ago because I

981
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:52,320
remember incessantly making fun of that title. Is that on PSP? Oh. Yeah, it's PSP. Oh, nevermind.

982
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:59,920
Nevermind. Nevermind. I stand corrected. Thank you. I also get Tomb Raider for us. Yes. Hey,

983
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:05,360
that's one for you. K? But it is items. Hooray, the 20 millionth Tomb Raider game. But of course

984
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:10,560
it's the first. You know, Tomb Raider 2 I actually liked for two things. One was locking the annoying

985
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:15,200
butler in the freezer, and, cause then he didn't follow you around anymore in the house. And the

986
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,400
second was hopping up on the balcony in her main room and making her jump off

987
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:25,760
and break her neck. You could also make her explode. There was a little button press code you

988
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,740
could do to make her explode. It was awesome. Eat Taco Bell? No. Loki what's

989
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:34,760
coming out in the U.S.? The U.S. not too much this week it's actually pretty slow

990
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,720
but um for the PC you've got full spectrum warrior 10 hammers only about

991
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:47,560
a week late, but still pretty good. Also, wow, Double Dare 3. That's pretty lame. Anyways,

992
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:52,720
um, yeah, so apparently not any- Oh, like the Nick show Double Dare? The Nickelodeon-

993
01:02:52,720 --> 01:03:01,480
Yeah. Wow, okay, whatever. Anyways, uh, not too much. But, um, PlayStation 2-wise, though,

994
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:07,260
You've got MLB 2K6, same also coming out on the Xbox this week.

995
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:14,060
Also you've got for the Playstation 2 Tourist Trophy, which is going to be the Gran Turismo

996
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,360
of motorcycles.

997
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:22,420
And Commando Strike Force on both PC, Playstation 2 and Xbox.

998
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:28,860
And finally, if you happen to be a fan of basketball games, NBA Ballers Phenom is finally

999
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:36,060
coming out in PlayStation 2, and also on PSP from Russia with Love and Bust-A-Move Deluxe,

1000
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:42,380
which is pretty cool, and Cabal's Dangerous Hunts for the redneck in you.

1001
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:46,040
I have a hard time believing Bust-A-Move Deluxe is cool because it's gonna be the same fucking

1002
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,040
game on another system.

1003
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,040
It is the same.

1004
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,040
I mean, come on!

1005
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,040
Come on!

1006
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,040
How many times does that game have to come out?

1007
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,880
Just go buy the Taito collection.

1008
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,300
And why did they have to steal the name of the, you know, popular dance game?

1009
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,900
Puzzy Bobble is such a cuter name. I know. Stupids.

1010
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:06,120
Alright, now if you like to play games an awful lot you might be trying to set a

1011
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,140
new record

1012
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:12,440
and Loki, you know Twin Galaxies, one of these big sites that tracks records, what are they up to?

1013
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,500
They're up to no good as usual.

1014
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,820
What they're doing actually, they have a couple things going on. The first is

1015
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,700
they're actually holding a contest

1016
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,420
it's called Who's the Toughest Gun in Dodge City

1017
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:26,460
of video games.

1018
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:33,020
And to kind of tie in with everything, there's going to be a bunch of contests being held,

1019
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:37,860
kind of demonstrations to see who can get the highest score in like Dig Dug, Donkey

1020
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:46,340
Kong, Gorf, Galaxian, Joust, Ms. Pac-Man, Qbert, and Zookeeper.

1021
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:52,180
And what they're also doing is they're tying this all into the 2007 Guinness Book of World

1022
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:58,920
records and actually that Twin Galaxies is going to be tied in with the Guinness Book

1023
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,020
so all these records will be going into the Guinness Book.

1024
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,140
No Burger Time?

1025
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:03,140
No Burger Time.

1026
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:04,140
Worthless!

1027
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:08,420
So, um, it's kind of funny though, I had to laugh because the Qbert one, they actually

1028
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:13,660
have this one old woman that's going to be competing.

1029
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,300
Is that the Granny Hardcore or whatever her name is?

1030
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:20,700
Yeah, yeah, it's one that, I can't remember her name, but yeah, I saw it in the email

1031
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:26,300
all I got from them but it yeah so basically this older woman she held the

1032
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:31,220
record on the show she held the record like you know years ago and finally you

1033
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:36,660
know basically been practicing between bridge matches and stuff like that and

1034
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:42,060
you know coming out to compete against this up-and-coming guy and I don't know

1035
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:48,140
I think that's kind of neat but I don't know you know who I would like to

1036
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:51,740
interview one day, is the guy who beat Pac-Man.

1037
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:55,220
Well, you can't

1038
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:58,660
technically beat it because the game was meant to just repeat the levels over and

1039
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,680
over again until they

1040
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,460
errored out. Yeah, right, right. And he did it on stage in Namco Japan.

1041
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:07,820
255 or something, right? Yeah. I would like to, I would like to meet

1042
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:11,860
that guy and have him on. Yeah, why not? Let's get some people on the show. Yeah, her name is

1043
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:15,980
Doris. By the way, we have a follow-up in our chat room thanks to

1044
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:20,900
GK 128 would like to point out Double Dare 3 is actually a Nancy Drew game

1045
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:25,060
Which makes it worse. I want to I wanted Mark Summers

1046
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:31,540
Nancy Drew books. I was little I wanted Mark Summers to have to explain, you know

1047
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:35,140
The slime pit that he had to jump through and get really freaked out by it because he was obsessive-compulsive

1048
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:40,860
Right. Remember we all saw the 2020 dateline whatever the hell it was. It heard that special. What does he do now?

1049
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:47,020
What does Mark Summers do today? He's a producer. He's a host of show called unwrapped on food. Oh, I

1050
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,700
Should know that you

1051
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:55,380
Also was a producer. In fact, I actually saw him. What was that show where they would play these massive pranks on people?

1052
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:01,000
He handed camera. Well, no, it wasn't that it was another one, but he was

1053
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:14,200
Well, they got him to host a show on there where they were destroying this guy's car

1054
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:18,200
and I mean they really didn't destroy his car, they destroyed a duplicate of it, but

1055
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,200
it was pretty funny.

1056
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,520
Okay, for everybody in chat room yelling out what would you do, okay, hello and welcome

1057
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:28,720
to like 10 years ago, okay, that's not what he's currently doing anymore, I think the

1058
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:36,560
the pie pod is a long gone, that's fucking sad I know that, anyway, last week big announcement

1059
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:41,600
from Game Developers Conference that Nintendo Revolution was going to have Sega Genesis

1060
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:46,800
and Turbo Graphics games on it, well here's the deal, Hudson is saying that, oh it gets

1061
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:56,360
better, CD-ROM2, CD games are also going to be on the Nintendo next gen system, so Snatcher,

1062
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:02,920
trap it might happen my heart is happy and the way because the Dracula whatever

1063
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:09,680
Dracula Dracula X red blood sapphire strider the one that they poured it over

1064
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,680
to Super Nintendo that was crap on Super Nintendo it actually was fun as a game

1065
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:19,040
but when you not the original no yep it's poop oh I brought it on the show

1066
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,880
once I'm playing on the webcam remember I yes a long time ago I was back in the

1067
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,780
three-hour live show days.

1068
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:30,180
Well, we could get away with doing stuff like that because nobody was listening.

1069
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:33,900
Loki, what else is going to be cool about the revolution?

1070
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,200
Well, I don't know if this is cool.

1071
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:45,980
This is just IGN with their exclusive on what they found out as the specs on the up and

1072
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:48,500
coming revolution system.

1073
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:56,760
Basically they are saying that the CPU is clocked at about 729 MHz, which in comparison

1074
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:06,980
is not quite twice that from the Gecko CPU in the GameCube, but pretty close.

1075
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:14,980
Also that the Revolution GPU's ATI Hollywood chip is going to be 243 MHz, which the GameCube

1076
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:17,600
GPU ran only at 162.

1077
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:24,300
all this together they said it's about as powerful as a current-gen Xbox so

1078
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:31,700
interesting I don't know I mean I don't know I I'd have to see because specs

1079
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,260
don't mean anything when it comes to games I mean you have to see what the

1080
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:40,620
games look like you could put the uber processor of God in those machines and

1081
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:46,220
it wouldn't matter if the games suck so it's all about the games and if that

1082
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:49,340
That ends up being what the specs really are, Nintendo better put their games where their

1083
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:55,180
mouth is when it's, you know, it's, we're all about the games, or what's the surprise

1084
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:59,860
or element of surprise, what was that thing he kept saying at the game developers conference?

1085
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,500
Games are meant to be one thing, fun, fun for everyone.

1086
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:06,940
Surprise, what was that thing, he said surprise element, displacing the scene, I don't remember

1087
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:08,580
what the hell the word was.

1088
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:12,340
Disrupting, disruption, disruption, that was the word.

1089
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,780
Disracing, where the hell was my line?

1090
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:15,780
Disruption gaming.

1091
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:18,580
I WANNA PLAY YOU AGAIN!

1092
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,580
That's like, really?

1093
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:25,580
That's when a little kid is bugging you wanting to play the game at the kiosk at GameStop.

1094
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:26,580
I WANNA PLAY AGAIN!

1095
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:27,580
That's disruption.

1096
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:30,480
I can't wait, I can't wait until they get like the funniest home videos where like the

1097
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:35,180
kids are playing the revolution system and little Billy pisses off his brother Tommy

1098
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:39,980
and the fucking kid just backhands him with the goddamn rev mode and just you know knocks

1099
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:41,220
the kid into a coma.

1100
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,580
That'd be great.

1101
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:46,520
And kudos to Berchas, who was first in the chatroom to correct us there.

1102
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:49,660
There's a slight delay between when we say things and when the chatroom hears it, but

1103
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:53,540
he was the first to say, or she, sorry, I don't know, Berchas says the first to say

1104
01:10:53,540 --> 01:11:00,020
disruptive gaming was the term there used at the Game Developers Conference.

1105
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:02,900
Alright, really quickly, we're going to wrap this segment up, but we have a couple quick

1106
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:06,420
top ten stories that we're going to get to first.

1107
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:10,660
And speaking of Japan, we were talking a couple stories in this segment about Japan, we haven't

1108
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:14,560
talked a whole lot about what their best selling games are, but we thought tonight we'd run

1109
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,260
over their top 10 sellers.

1110
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:21,340
No surprise there that Final Fantasy XII is at the top of their charts.

1111
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:25,860
In their second week, they've now sold over 2 million copies of Final Fantasy XII in Japan.

1112
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,380
That's pretty awesome.

1113
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:30,180
Also in the top 10, at number 10, Mario Kart DS.

1114
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:36,100
At number 9, and I apologize in advance for this horrible pronunciation, Haru Kanaru Toki

1115
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:47,660
No Uchi, Day 3, Unmei no Meikuyu.

1116
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:49,420
Number 8, Brain Training for Adults.

1117
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:51,260
Number 7, English Training.

1118
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:53,440
Number 6, Dynasty Warriors 5, Empires.

1119
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,360
Number 5, Brain Training 2.

1120
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:00,980
Number 4, Animal Crossing Wild World in its 18th week on the Japanese charts, 2.2 million

1121
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:01,980
copies.

1122
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,000
Number 3, Ace Combat Zero, The Belkan War.

1123
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,960
Number two, Pokemon Rangers Diamond and Pearl.

1124
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,760
And number one, of course, was Final Fantasy XII there.

1125
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:16,040
So very interesting, one, two, three, three brain training games in the top ten there.

1126
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,560
And it has not come out here.

1127
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,480
Alright now, Loki, you have another top ten of sorts.

1128
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:25,840
Top ten games being played on the Xbox 360 or live.

1129
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,840
So I'm kind of questioning the whole live bit of it when you'll find out.

1130
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,500
First one, of course, being Halo 2 at the top of the list.

1131
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:37,180
Number two is Oblivion, which I don't understand how that would be played on Xbox Live.

1132
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:39,060
Is that an April Fools joke, maybe?

1133
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:43,820
Because either it's got to be just counting the time that you're signed in actually playing

1134
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:44,820
the game.

1135
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:45,820
It must be that.

1136
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:49,300
But in which case, this chart doesn't serve the purpose I thought it did.

1137
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:53,700
I thought these charts were supposed to tell us what games people are playing online head

1138
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:54,700
to head.

1139
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,300
I don't get it, but whatever.

1140
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,300
Or whatever.

1141
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,300
Keep going.

1142
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:00,540
Number three, Ghost Recon 3 Advanced Warfighter.

1143
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:03,180
Number four, Call of Duty 2.

1144
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:09,540
five fight night round three number six project Gotham racing three and number

1145
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:13,260
seven perfect dark zero which is surprising because the game sucks number

1146
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:16,820
eight a lot of people a lot of people disagree with that statement just so

1147
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:20,820
you know I didn't like it either but a lot of people disagree with us you know

1148
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:25,220
what I'm going back to play the games again all the way through I will play it

1149
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:30,580
so you know whatever I might change my opinion later just seriously though they

1150
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:37,140
should be able to jump. And number 8, Battlefield 2 Modern Combat, whether that be the demo

1151
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:45,140
or the original Battlefield 2. Number 9, Dead or Alive 4, and number 10, Burnout Revenge.

1152
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:49,360
See, I have a hard time believing Burnout Revenge is that far down on the list. When

1153
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,380
all those games have Xbox Live Aware. It doesn't make any sense to me either. Comment from

1154
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:57,140
Chatroom's GK128 says this is probably ranked by how many games are signed on as Live Aware.

1155
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:00,640
yep I agree I think that's the only way this list can be legit but and I

1156
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,340
apologize if I'm pronouncing this name wrong

1157
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:07,560
Tyrico says that on oblivion you have the chat for live so you can get help for

1158
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,500
quests and stuff

1159
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:12,160
so I guess that's true I mean the live aware element

1160
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,400
you can chat with your friends for instance you know what you know

1161
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,800
your buddy Eric and Mel right yeah okay Mel just got on Xbox Live and so I was

1162
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:20,520
playing Hexic

1163
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:24,060
or what yeah Hexic I was playing that game earlier she was sending me all these

1164
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,340
messages while I was playing

1165
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,980
and I was sending your voice messages back. So you can do the chat things.

1166
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:32,260
I need to friend them, because I don't have them on my list.

1167
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,260
I'll tell you where to get their names.

1168
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:38,180
By the way, you can post your names if you want to maybe be our friend. We

1169
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:39,620
sometimes friend people randomly.

1170
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:43,080
I friend everybody. I'll friend long-time listeners of the show.

1171
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,900
I don't friend people that come out of the woodwork, but I friend people who are long-time listeners.

1172
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,980
But if you annoy me, I'll delete you.

1173
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:53,320
It's on our forums, originslaunchradio.com and there's

1174
01:14:53,320 --> 01:15:02,520
on the forums. Speaking of which, Jason, Jason, he told me, you know, hey, add me, I sent

1175
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:07,580
him a friend request. Never added me. Our webmaster, Jason? Our webmaster, Jason. Shame

1176
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:12,660
on you, Jason. Also, I want to give a shout out real quick to our MySpace, because we

1177
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:16,520
got a comment on MySpace this week where somebody said we don't talk about the MySpace enough

1178
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,460
and maybe people don't know that it's there, but yes, we have jumped the shark and gotten

1179
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:26,660
ourselves in MySpace. MySpace, where the internet goes to die, we know, we know. However, we're

1180
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:30,960
using it to bring you clips from episodes that you may not even be able to get anymore,

1181
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:37,580
and this week, I actually went through, and everybody on our friends list, I left comments

1182
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:41,700
in MySpace. Actually, I didn't get everybody, because some of your pages are really wacky,

1183
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,280
and I couldn't even figure out how to add a comment. So if I couldn't figure it out

1184
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:47,620
in five seconds, I didn't comment you. I'm so sorry. Send a message, and I'll look at

1185
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:51,940
it again but we're leaving comments with people now so and that took a little

1186
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:56,200
while but it's all good so if you want to get a comment on your myspace from

1187
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,760
orange laundry we'd be happy to do that for you however I make I'm making Jamie

1188
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,660
or Loki do it next time it's www.myspace.com slash orange

1189
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,480

1190
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,300
more picture things we were doing picture things and I need to get you

1191
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,960

1192
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,040
