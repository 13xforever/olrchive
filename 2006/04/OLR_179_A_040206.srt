1
00:00:14,287 --> 00:00:16,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, April 2nd, 2006.

2
00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:19,788
[SPEAKER_02]: April Fool's hits the web, but is Final Fantasy XIII a joke?

3
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:22,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the Xbox 360 drought finally over?

4
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:25,470
[SPEAKER_02]: And are UMD movies about to meet an untimely fate?

5
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:37,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:37,694 --> 00:00:40,995
[SPEAKER_04]: We are here gathered together to talk about video games today.

7
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:43,078
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

8
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:19,270
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm eating an organic unbleached flour mushroom leek strudel with black sesame seeds on it.

9
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:19,750
[SPEAKER_04]: It's delicious!

10
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:36,394
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like eight of those names.

11
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:38,115
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very delicious.

12
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:42,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of my shopping now at Whole Foods markets, which is all organic food.

13
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:43,816
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive.

14
00:01:44,296 --> 00:01:45,197
[SPEAKER_00]: It is expensive.

15
00:01:45,257 --> 00:01:45,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.

16
00:01:45,677 --> 00:01:53,419
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have felt so healthy the last two months since I've started eating all organic and vegetarian and cut out red meat.

17
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,279
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't drink soda anymore.

18
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:56,180
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a soda yesterday.

19
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a diet vanilla Pepsi, and it made my stomach hurt.

20
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:05,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I still drink diet, but I try very hard not to drink regular soda.

21
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:06,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I make my own soda now.

22
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:10,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy club soda and Torani, the flavored syrups.

23
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so kind of like Italian soda.

24
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,510
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do Italian sodas.

25
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:13,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

26
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:14,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, because you can get the sugar-free ones.

27
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:15,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Those aren't so bad.

28
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:22,899
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also make carbonated lemonade using club soda and lemon juice and lime juice and Splenda.

29
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:23,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Not for me.

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:23,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-mm.

31
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:25,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Ice Cream Tea

32
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:05,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Slice apples, popcorn, you know, like some plain popcorn, soy nuts, they're good, cashews, cashews are very good for you, they have good oils, and brown rice.

33
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:07,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and super bacon.

34
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:10,628
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's bad for you.

35
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:12,709
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a heart attack recipe right there.

36
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:20,832
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get away from the Food Network and do a little bit of how was your gaming week, the part of the show where we talk about what we've been playing this week and what we've been up to.

37
00:03:20,893 --> 00:03:22,853
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I've got a lot.

38
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:25,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about the others, but DarkSakura, you always start us off.

39
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:26,555
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been playing this week?

40
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:30,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've had quite a bit of new gaming coming in the house.

41
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:31,865
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually got Beatmania.

42
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:33,807
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing the crap out of it.

43
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:38,410
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Kingdom Hearts 2, but since I was already playing it in Japanese, I've been sort of not so much about that.

44
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,553
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start over on that probably within the week after I get my stupid Flash homework done.

45
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:51,699
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also... Fry's, of all places, is carrying import PSP games.

46
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:59,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed that last time I went to Fry's, for those, because we're nationwide, Fry's is a big electronics chain on the West Coast, and they've started to carry limited import games.

47
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:00,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I saw Mahjong in the Game Boy.

48
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:01,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

49
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:02,454
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.

50
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:04,875
[SPEAKER_00]: The new Initial D game is really, really cool.

51
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:06,476
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based off of, I think, the version 3.

52
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,069
[SPEAKER_00]: that's out in the arcade.

53
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:10,929
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really pretty.

54
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,690
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Eurobeat fantastic.

55
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots and lots of Eurobeat.

56
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:19,593
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's Initial D. There's not much else I can say about that.

57
00:04:19,653 --> 00:04:24,574
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had out the Taito collection that we're sort of considering except that it's coming out in the U.S.

58
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:25,895
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like a no point to that.

59
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:29,476
[SPEAKER_00]: And we almost picked up Guilty Gear but that's also coming out in the U.S.

60
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:31,137
[SPEAKER_00]: so we were sort of not so much on that too.

61
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:37,583
[SPEAKER_00]: and Dan and his friend have been playing a whole lot of Burnout.

62
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:38,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.

63
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,146
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so tired of that game.

64
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Why so tired of the Burnout?

65
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the same thing over and over?

66
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:50,619
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in my... Okay, my computer room is on the other side of where our big TV is.

67
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:56,563
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the middle of working on my flash homework right now is to do this big photo slideshow.

68
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to get my photos all together.

69
00:04:58,743 --> 00:05:01,024
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just about to do my last little touch.

70
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:08,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

71
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:16,249
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also had MAME action going on because one of Dan's coworkers and a friend of mine, George, Necco Boy.

72
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:16,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

73
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:26,352
[SPEAKER_00]: He and our friend Tim, who's actually, for anyone who's in cosplay circles, he's very well known because he does the fabulous Rick Hunter Macross outfit.

74
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,695
[SPEAKER_00]: He did Evo 1 at Anime Expo.

75
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:30,797
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been in Japanese cosplay photos.

76
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:35,662
[SPEAKER_00]: But he also has been helping build MAME cabinets in my garage.

77
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,217
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have more than one now.

78
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,538
[SPEAKER_00]: We're building George's.

79
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:45,181
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't talked about this on the show in a while, but both DarkSakura and Loki have main cabinets in their house.

80
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:47,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, DarkSakura, you guys took a pole position?

81
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:49,243
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a stand-up pole position.

82
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:55,846
[SPEAKER_00]: They're building this one out of some other generic one, but it has this fabulous 1982 art on it.

83
00:05:56,487 --> 00:06:02,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really super cool, but they were working on this all day while me and the fabulous Miss Tia were running around.

84
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did they get the specs on how to do this?

85
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:06,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, are they doing it off a website?

86
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:08,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Off a just crash and burn?

87
00:06:08,294 --> 00:06:21,603
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a website, and if you give me just a second, I can get it, because it's the one that my husband goes to, which happens to be on my favorites bar called, it's arcadecontrols.com slash arcade.htm.

88
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:24,204
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically build your own arcade controls FAQ.

89
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:30,709
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how to build your, it goes a lot into the cabinets, it goes into how to build the controllers, what you need for it.

90
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,130
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really neat.

91
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

92
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:38,905
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I'll talk to Dan about getting the specs on his cabinet, so if anybody else is interested.

93
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:39,786
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

94
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:40,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds cool.

95
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:41,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

96
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:41,987
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

97
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

98
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:45,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Play any of your main cabinet?

99
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,312
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually built your cabinet.

100
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:49,593
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't convert a machine.

101
00:06:49,653 --> 00:06:50,914
[SPEAKER_04]: You built a brand new thing.

102
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:51,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and it shows.

103
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:57,338
[SPEAKER_04]: We were roommates back when you were building that, and I just remember that that was a project.

104
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, to say the least.

105
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the project is being stored at my...

106
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:10,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a lot of 360 stuff again I think I played a little bit of Oblivion I played more Outfit and I realized that game really sucks

107
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:31,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

108
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:41,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this isn't really my kind of game, so I haven't really been playing a lot of it, but I've listened to other shows that seem to really like this game, so what's your issue with it?

109
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my issue with it, I tried playing multiplayer, and again, we're just with two-player split-screen, which is fine.

110
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:52,534
[SPEAKER_03]: For one, the controls really suck in it.

111
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:53,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Like,

112
00:07:53,672 --> 00:08:02,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I kept calling in the destruction on demand, the big feature where you get stuff to fall from the sky, and the stuff falling from the sky kept crushing my characters!

113
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:07,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I would aim it further away from me, and the stupid

114
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:08,488
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

115
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:40,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Far Cry Instinct's Predator which I've never played the original Far Cry Instinct's but from what I hear it's not very different as far as graphics and stuff.

116
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:44,500
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of graphic upgrades and stuff but it is pretty fun.

117
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,783
[SPEAKER_03]: It is kind of, actually it's very hard, very frustrating.

118
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:52,204
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started to cheat and now it's fun.

119
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:55,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how they put the cheats in there because cheats make it fun.

120
00:08:55,726 --> 00:09:00,549
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still really challenging but it kind of lightens it up a little bit.

121
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:14,366
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'm kind of looking forward to that and then played more Burnout more Ghost Recon and I hear that she's working that too and what else?

122
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:23,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Mimai Katamari Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories all that fun stuff I played a little bit of Beatmania didn't like it oh, why not?

123
00:09:25,254 --> 00:09:30,138
[SPEAKER_03]: the interface is too colorful and to be honest I

124
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:33,589
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't think the new controllers were that great, and I don't know why.

125
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:38,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, before, they seemed to be pretty good, but that turntable doesn't seem, it seems to be sticky, the turntable.

126
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:41,651
[SPEAKER_00]: It loosens up after you play with it a bit.

127
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:48,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's just, even the new songs were kind of okay, but I just wasn't very impressed by it.

128
00:09:48,853 --> 00:09:56,515
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just kind of, yay, cool, Beatmania, anything to be able to go, I'm not going to go rush out to go buy it, though.

129
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:58,416
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

130
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:05,127
[SPEAKER_04]: My Gaming Week also consisted of Beatmania, which I picked up earlier in the week, so kind of funny there.

131
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:10,588
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all played that, but of course that's not a surprise when you consider that we started as a music gaming station.

132
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:12,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously we owe a lot to Beatmania.

133
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:18,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's very interesting, Beatmania, because when you consider it, Beatmania is about, what, eight years old?

134
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,111
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is really the first time that it's coming out in the U.S.

135
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:23,251
[SPEAKER_04]: for console.

136
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, of course we had the

137
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:25,511
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

138
00:10:47,436 --> 00:11:15,773
[SPEAKER_04]: much more accessible to beginners in the fact that there is no separate mode for beginner mode, but they fuse the beginning level songs into the normal game, which I think is good, because I think you don't want to scare people off, because even though Beatmania is selling itself as bringing the arcade experience home, which kind of is a little weird to me, because there's really nothing but import machines for Beatmania, it's kind of weird there, but

139
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:19,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good first exposure for people.

140
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:24,012
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it... There was a lot of the old 5Key music in there.

141
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:24,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you notice?

142
00:11:24,632 --> 00:11:26,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I noticed a lot of really old stuff.

143
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:27,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Hunting for You and Metal Gear.

144
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Just really, really old songs.

145
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,076
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that's cool because they picked some good stuff.

146
00:11:31,496 --> 00:11:33,397
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a very interesting song list.

147
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:35,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the 5Key song list is actually pretty solid.

148
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they got a good mix of stuff.

149
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:44,584
[SPEAKER_04]: 7Key, for me, could have used some more recent stuff, but I think I understand why they're doing what they're doing because...

150
00:11:45,114 --> 00:11:49,539
[SPEAKER_04]: If there is to be a second mix, then they can start dipping into the later stuff and things, you know.

151
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:51,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

152
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:53,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you like the Moby song?

153
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:54,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I did like the Moby song.

154
00:11:54,544 --> 00:11:55,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the video.

155
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:57,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the Timo Ma song is the best, though.

156
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:01,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan and I sat there with the Moby song going, what is this?

157
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:03,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.

158
00:12:03,132 --> 00:12:03,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's good.

159
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:06,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan and I are both like Moby, but we just didn't like it.

160
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:09,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the interesting thing is that I noticed this in a lot of reviews.

161
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Beatmania has been getting a lot of negative reviews out there on the circuit right now.

162
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:18,415
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people can't seem to not want to compare this to Guitar Hero.

163
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:24,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's comparing this game to Guitar Hero, which I think is kind of funny because this game existed long before Guitar Hero.

164
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,519
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

165
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:54,090
[SPEAKER_04]: They're done well.

166
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,171
[SPEAKER_04]: The cover songs are done well.

167
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:58,773
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pretty faithful to the originals, and it really ups that fun factor.

168
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:09,681
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with Beatmania, and why I don't think Beatmania is going to have that same buzz as Guitar Hero is now set at the bar, is that a lot of these songs are not recognizable to most people.

169
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:12,383
[SPEAKER_04]: They tried a little bit with the song list.

170
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:14,304
[SPEAKER_04]: They got Toxic and Funky Town.

171
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:15,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, people know those songs.

172
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:19,028
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of songs in there that are not so recognizable.

173
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:21,110
[SPEAKER_04]: is that a good thing or a bad thing?

174
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:33,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know I'm spoiled by years of Japanese releases so I do recognize all the songs that are in there it's hard for me to look at this game impartially when I've been raised on the Japanese series for years and years um

175
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,761
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just weird.

176
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:38,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know.

177
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:41,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be interesting to see how the general public reacts to this.

178
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:45,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they going to pick up on this game, even though there aren't a lot of recognizable songs?

179
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:46,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

180
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:53,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some people over last night, including some people who don't play games a whole lot, and I know a few of them were really digging on Beatmania.

181
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:57,576
[SPEAKER_04]: They thought it was kind of fun and very pretty, even though they didn't really recognize a lot of the songs in it.

182
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you notice that 321 Stars is the another?

183
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just to make it a little harder there.

184
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:03,921
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like...

185
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:10,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, plus they did something weird with five keys is that there's only the one difficulty.

186
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:11,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was kind of odd.

187
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,973
[SPEAKER_04]: They just made some very odd changes.

188
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:20,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the one that really irks me is that they made the triple A's a lot lower in score to be able to get.

189
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,782
[SPEAKER_04]: And just in general, the grading's a little easier.

190
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, I mean, I understand why they want to do that.

191
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:28,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, they're trying to cater to the beginners and people haven't seen the game before, but

192
00:14:29,554 --> 00:14:30,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Beep Mania

193
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,476
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hell of a good first release compared to what DDR First Mix was.

194
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:58,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's a potential for really great stuff in the future.

195
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,045
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just kind of have to think, okay, if Beatmania can grow the same way DDR did, it's going to be great.

196
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:06,047
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, we have to have a little faith here in the beginning.

197
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:07,668
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see what happens.

198
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:12,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say hello to our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

199
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Click a chat.

200
00:15:13,794 --> 00:15:15,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And always looking for your comments there.

201
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

202
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,541
[SPEAKER_04]: The 23rd Magus says, I believe this is a response to Guitar Hero.

203
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,022
[SPEAKER_04]: They made music games accessible.

204
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:27,882
[SPEAKER_04]: They made music games accessible.

205
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:29,562
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very interesting statement.

206
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:36,564
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people sometimes get put off by the DDR pad and by the turntables and the keys and seeing all those notes falling.

207
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:38,824
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was something about Guitar Hero that was a little different.

208
00:15:39,424 --> 00:15:39,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

209
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:40,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

210
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:46,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, if you want to join our chat, www.orangeloundtrader.com

211
00:15:47,302 --> 00:16:16,236
[SPEAKER_04]: and click on chat and 23rd Magus wants to also point out that they actually have the calculations if you want to look at calculations for the true AAAs that there are websites out there that will let you know how your score compares to the Japanese version one of them he's mentioning is VJ Army so pretty interesting I did notice that it was ridiculously easy but it was sort of nice because the good thing about this is that I could play it with Dan and Dan's not really a beatmania person he was playing on my old controller

212
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:23,907
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt so bad for him because really my old controller is now hitting the crappy phase.

213
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:33,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what I call these folks sometimes are the Japanese elitists out there on some of the websites that nothing is good enough unless it's the Japanese version.

214
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:35,217
[SPEAKER_04]: The American versions will always be shit.

215
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:43,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the problem with the Japanese elitists out there on the message boards when it comes to Beatmania is that they forget that these games aren't made for them.

216
00:16:44,246 --> 00:16:48,607
[SPEAKER_04]: They think that Konami owes them something because they've been buying the games for years and years.

217
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:54,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that got Konami to release the game here, but still, the game is not for you.

218
00:16:54,368 --> 00:16:55,508
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for everybody.

219
00:16:55,988 --> 00:17:00,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll toss a couple frickin' bones at the loyal supporters.

220
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:03,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there was a couple Night Style songs in there, and there's some kind of neat stuff.

221
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just having the 5-key and 7-key in there is pretty neat.

222
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,711
[SPEAKER_04]: But the game's not for you.

223
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:09,951
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for everybody.

224
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I honestly did think that the song selection was pretty sparse in comparison.

225
00:17:14,922 --> 00:17:17,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Because think about, like, the last one that I bought was 8th style.

226
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:21,264
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about just how many freaking songs were in 8th style.

227
00:17:21,884 --> 00:17:29,327
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, when you consider that we have both modes, I do sort of wish that you could do the 7 key stuff in 5 key mode, you know, to do that too.

228
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,848
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see why they did it the way that they did.

229
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:36,350
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is like you're getting two games in one, just both with very sparse song lists.

230
00:17:37,768 --> 00:17:39,049
[SPEAKER_04]: So I recommend Beatmania.

231
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:43,412
[SPEAKER_04]: If for no other reason than I want to see a Beatmania second mix be released here in the US.

232
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:44,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, it is good.

233
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:46,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody should at least check it out.

234
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:50,677
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because even if you're scared of DDR, there's no reason to be scared of Beatmania.

235
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:55,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally, I didn't pick it up because one, I know Konami sent me a free one.

236
00:17:55,761 --> 00:18:02,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, because if it's anything like Guitar Hero, I'll play it once and not play it for again.

237
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I did with my Guitar Hero.

238
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:05,648
[SPEAKER_03]: It is leaning up

239
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:11,855
[SPEAKER_03]: against my MAME cabinet because eventually it will be used for Guitar Freaks.

240
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:13,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero is a party game for me.

241
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:17,137
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sitting there in the corner and then when people come over they go, what's that?

242
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:18,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero!

243
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:22,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Beatmania is going to be kind of a similar thing around here.

244
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:27,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still playing it an awful lot but I find that I'm going to use my controller to go back to the Japanese mixes.

245
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:28,702
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, I'm different.

246
00:18:28,762 --> 00:18:30,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not like most of the people listening to this show.

247
00:18:31,123 --> 00:18:34,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played the hell out of those Japanese mixes.

248
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:34,965
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, this is

249
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:39,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Good new controller plus best hits is what this game is to me.

250
00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:41,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that really is how I feel about it.

251
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:48,872
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good thing about it is that now I can have friends pick up, you know, who are like, oh, that's neat, but be so intimidated by it.

252
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:51,754
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got access now to one that's going to work on their PlayStations.

253
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:55,556
[SPEAKER_00]: They can practice at home and then come over and play the imports with me.

254
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:59,678
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gotten me back into Bimani because...

255
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:07,796
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, having a new DDR arcade mix is all fine and dandy and everything, but I've got a new Beatmania in my house that I've been playing the hell out of.

256
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:13,397
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went hunting the other day to try to find my copy of 8th Style, and I'm actually considering going and buying 10th.

257
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:14,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

258
00:19:14,698 --> 00:19:15,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's leave it at that.

259
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:16,198
[SPEAKER_04]: That sums it up.

260
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:17,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, more games.

261
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Good thing it's a slow news week, because I've got a lot of games to talk about.

262
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Hearts 2.

263
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:23,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like Kingdom Hearts 1.

264
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,845
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why I didn't like Kingdom Hearts 1?

265
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,405
[SPEAKER_04]: The camera, the gummy ship.

266
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:31,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Hearts 1 was such a phenomenal idea.

267
00:19:32,886 --> 00:19:33,666
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the weird thing.

268
00:19:33,826 --> 00:19:35,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the story.

269
00:19:35,427 --> 00:19:36,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the music.

270
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:37,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the cinema.

271
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:41,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I love everything about Kingdom Hearts except playing the game.

272
00:19:42,428 --> 00:19:43,268
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my problem.

273
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:46,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Hearts 2, it's all fixed.

274
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It is all fixed.

275
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,001
[SPEAKER_04]: The camera, not a problem for me anymore.

276
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:56,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Minimap, there now to help my 3D confused butt get through the levels.

277
00:19:58,005 --> 00:19:58,665
[SPEAKER_04]: It's phenomenal.

278
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Hearts 2 is phenomenal.

279
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:04,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't describe how incredible I think this game is.

280
00:20:04,408 --> 00:20:08,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not been sucked into a game this much, I don't think since the Super Nintendo game.

281
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I have literally been playing with every spare moment I have this week.

282
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:13,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Kingdom Hearts 2.

283
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:17,443
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed that Roxas doesn't annoy me as much in English as he does in Japanese.

284
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:22,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what's great about it, and I know a lot of people have been bitching about that three-hour prologue.

285
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:25,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to give any spoilers, but there's like a three-hour prologue, essentially.

286
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:29,428
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to play this game for 3 hours, 3 hours 15 minutes until you see the title screen.

287
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:38,014
[SPEAKER_04]: The nice thing about it is for those of us that didn't really play it the whole way through Kingdom Hearts 1, it really does explain it in a not cheesy manner.

288
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's kind of, I don't want to, I'm trying to do this without spoilers.

289
00:20:40,915 --> 00:20:42,276
[SPEAKER_03]: It tells it through flashbacks, essentially.

290
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:43,637
[SPEAKER_03]: It also ties in with Chains of Memories.

291
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:48,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right, because Chains of Memories was more event, well, I knew actually quite a number of people who played it.

292
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,242
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, my plan is to go back and play Chains of Memories.

293
00:20:52,322 --> 00:20:53,303
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't had time to.

294
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:56,043
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complete story.

295
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,624
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that it sort of brings you back into it.

296
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:04,465
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not going to play Kingdom Hearts 1, you're playing Kingdom Hearts 2, just read the spoiler fact for Chains of Memories, read the spoiler fact for Kingdom Hearts.

297
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:08,286
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that way it'll kind of catch you up with the story and then you can enjoy the game.

298
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,806
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen the ending of Kingdom Hearts, right?

299
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:11,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen the ending of Kingdom Hearts.

300
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:19,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny because the way I was introduced to Kingdom Hearts is I dated someone a long time ago who was really, really into it and I kind of saw everything.

301
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I got shown all of that.

302
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:21,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

303
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:28,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see the final movie from... I did send you the final movie from the deep dive, didn't I?

304
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was... Maybe.

305
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,664
[SPEAKER_00]: With the international version in Japan, after Kingdom Hearts came out, they labeled it the deep dive.

306
00:21:36,704 --> 00:21:38,465
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the Sephiroth battle in it.

307
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:39,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

308
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:48,013
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had this extra movie file, which part of it plays in the prologue, with the nameless people at the end.

309
00:21:48,314 --> 00:21:48,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

310
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:51,333
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show that to you later.

311
00:21:52,895 --> 00:22:00,420
[SPEAKER_00]: I really recommend for people before you play Kingdom Hearts to go back and get that movie off of Deep Dive because it really does tie in a lot more too.

312
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Familiarize yourself just even the slightest bit with a Kingdom Hearts 1 story and I think you'll be okay.

313
00:22:05,343 --> 00:22:07,844
[SPEAKER_04]: The game itself is fantastic.

314
00:22:07,904 --> 00:22:09,905
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so deep.

315
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:11,786
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much to it.

316
00:22:11,906 --> 00:22:14,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the drive and the limits.

317
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I just fought this one battle not that long ago.

318
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:20,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Beauty and the Beast level.

319
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,691
[SPEAKER_04]: The final battle you do in there is in the ballroom.

320
00:22:22,711 --> 00:22:24,692
[SPEAKER_04]: You're using the chandelier to attack the monster.

321
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:26,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been that like, whoa, at an RPG level.

322
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:36,418
[SPEAKER_04]: since I first saw a summon in Final Fantasy VII.

323
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:45,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I heard the new system that they have where it's like this action system where you hit the triangle button depending on certain things that are going on.

324
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:50,671
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll do kind of like the God of War where you'll do kind of cinematic attacks and stuff.

325
00:22:51,132 --> 00:22:52,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are really impressive in the game.

326
00:22:53,554 --> 00:22:58,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Kingdom Hearts does have a few things that are kind of... Okay, here's the thing.

327
00:22:59,039 --> 00:22:59,840
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't like...

328
00:23:00,954 --> 00:23:01,755
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

329
00:23:22,745 --> 00:23:23,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Setsur, Vivi,

330
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:56,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there's just, the whole game is made up of these little fanboy things, and if you watch Disney movies at all, and I don't watch a lot of Disney movies, I've seen most of the big ones, but if you play the Final Fantasy games at all, there's so many things in there to just make you go, eee, eee, eee, you know, so.

331
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:06,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I highly recommend Kingdom Hearts 2, although I think there's going to be some folks out there listening to this going, I know I wouldn't like Kingdom Hearts, I don't really like those action RPGs.

332
00:24:06,756 --> 00:24:08,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, you probably won't like Kingdom Hearts.

333
00:24:08,317 --> 00:24:15,063
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing about this game that's really going to win you over, but I just think for those that are into these types of games, it's so in-depth, there's so much to do.

334
00:24:15,283 --> 00:24:16,764
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably already have your copy, honestly.

335
00:24:18,715 --> 00:24:19,476
[SPEAKER_04]: What else have I played this week?

336
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:19,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't end it.

337
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:20,537
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more.

338
00:24:20,857 --> 00:24:27,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I borrowed Need for Speed Underground or Most Wanted Underground, whatever that game is on Xbox 360.

339
00:24:28,729 --> 00:24:31,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is the weird thing about Most Wanted on 360.

340
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,932
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the showgirls of video games to me.

341
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:37,794
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so bad, I can't stop playing it.

342
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:42,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you see what I was dealing with for, what, three months at my house?

343
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:45,498
[SPEAKER_04]: There is seriously nothing to like about that game.

344
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:47,419
[SPEAKER_04]: The cutscenes are stupid.

345
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,540
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a cop!

346
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,721
[SPEAKER_04]: And washed out.

347
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:56,283
[SPEAKER_04]: and the graphics are crap compared to Ridge Racer and even Full Auto and some of the other games I've played.

348
00:24:56,923 --> 00:25:00,125
[SPEAKER_04]: There is really not a lot to like about this game.

349
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:01,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't stop playing it.

350
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:05,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Until I got Kingdom Hearts, I could not stop playing that game.

351
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:06,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it is.

352
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:16,631
[SPEAKER_03]: The cutscenes, they're done and it's supposed to be like that, the washed out, because it's supposed to be kind of like comic book-ish.

353
00:25:17,191 --> 00:25:19,172
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought the cutscenes were actually pretty cool.

354
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:21,742
[SPEAKER_03]: There were too many of them, granted.

355
00:25:22,142 --> 00:25:26,265
[SPEAKER_03]: The graphics weren't that bad, but they weren't much better than the Xbox version.

356
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:30,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I don't know, I never really got in the need for speed.

357
00:25:30,808 --> 00:25:32,709
[SPEAKER_03]: But I thought the game was okay looking.

358
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:34,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked the whole Fast and the Furious thing.

359
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:37,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you could totally tell it was an upgraded Xbox game.

360
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:38,633
[SPEAKER_04]: You could totally tell.

361
00:25:38,793 --> 00:25:39,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that is true.

362
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:41,014
[SPEAKER_03]: You could totally tell that.

363
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:43,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the funny thing I have to laugh about.

364
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,077
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how the cutscenes are done in this?

365
00:25:45,297 --> 00:25:47,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know that game coming out, Ace Combat Zero, The Belkan War?

366
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:48,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine...

367
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:49,918
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

368
00:26:04,404 --> 00:26:08,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridge Racer is obviously a superior game, yet I keep playing this one.

369
00:26:08,588 --> 00:26:09,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

370
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:11,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll just have to take it back and let you borrow it.

371
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:13,071
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

372
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:14,172
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're not taking it.

373
00:26:14,192 --> 00:26:16,154
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can take it until I beat Kingdom Hearts.

374
00:26:16,735 --> 00:26:20,097
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's go to chat room because I'm sure chat room has some stuff they want to say on these games.

375
00:26:20,418 --> 00:26:24,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zaku, Kingdom Hearts 2 equals makes fanboys cream in their pants.

376
00:26:25,242 --> 00:26:25,862
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

377
00:26:26,122 --> 00:26:28,504
[SPEAKER_04]: There's things here that not just for fanboys.

378
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:30,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot that's pant cream worthy.

379
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:31,767
[SPEAKER_00]: I placed a rebuttal in the chat room.

380
00:26:32,228 --> 00:26:32,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did you?

381
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Kingdom Hearts 2 is fangirl fodder.

382
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,271
[SPEAKER_00]: So much fangirl fodder.

383
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:37,992
[SPEAKER_04]: It's both.

384
00:26:38,812 --> 00:26:39,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

385
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:42,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Also in the chat room, Rini says, VV is the friggin' win.

386
00:26:43,516 --> 00:26:49,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, but I haven't gotten to the Tron level yet, so I'm going to hold back on the friggin' win.

387
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,141
[SPEAKER_04]: It better not let me down.

388
00:26:51,281 --> 00:26:52,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Tron level better not let me down.

389
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:53,663
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the Tron level.

390
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:54,504
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't let you down.

391
00:26:55,544 --> 00:26:56,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it true you get to play light cycles?

392
00:26:56,945 --> 00:26:58,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you get friggin' light cycles.

393
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:01,749
[SPEAKER_00]: But the light cycle part actually is not as cool.

394
00:27:03,137 --> 00:27:04,079
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do get light cycles.

395
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,464
[SPEAKER_04]: That is great.

396
00:27:07,684 --> 00:27:09,848
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about all the yaoi.

397
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,681
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ PooEater in the chat room, which by the way is one of my favorite nicknames ever.

398
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:16,602
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ PooEater in chat says, nothing wrong with the fanboys.

399
00:27:16,662 --> 00:27:17,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, nothing at all.

400
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:17,862
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

401
00:27:17,982 --> 00:27:19,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's fanboy about something.

402
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:21,463
[SPEAKER_04]: For some people it's football, basketball.

403
00:27:21,843 --> 00:27:25,004
[SPEAKER_04]: For some people it's, you know, crocheting.

404
00:27:25,464 --> 00:27:26,444
[SPEAKER_04]: For some people it's Kingdom Hearts.

405
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:33,226
[SPEAKER_03]: You know they were saying that they're going to announce at E3 this year that they're continuing the Kingdom Hearts series but in a different way.

406
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:37,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely it's something they're going to keep making games.

407
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:45,203
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're thinking about expanding in different ways, maybe not like Chains of Memories, but... God, I'm hoping... You know what?

408
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:48,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what we were theorizing when we were playing Kingdom Hearts?

409
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:49,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the boys were over, we were talking about it.

410
00:27:50,566 --> 00:27:51,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

411
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:53,928
[SPEAKER_04]: They say they want to do something different with Kingdom Hearts.

412
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:56,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Square Enix says they're working on a new MMO.

413
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm?

414
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:01,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Would Kingdom Hearts not make the coolest MMO?

415
00:28:01,344 --> 00:28:03,465
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that would totally get me back to play online.

416
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:12,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's going to be what happens because, one, they're working on something else, not that for an MMO.

417
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:14,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember hearing about it last year.

418
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:14,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

419
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:16,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard that they're doing something else.

420
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:19,357
[SPEAKER_04]: But my brain couldn't help but go there.

421
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:22,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about that seems oh so right.

422
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:23,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine?

423
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And the MMO could be updated with new Disney and Square Enix.

424
00:28:27,626 --> 00:28:29,808
[SPEAKER_00]: I see them doing an anime series.

425
00:28:30,488 --> 00:28:32,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Or an OAB series.

426
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very surprised they haven't already done this.

427
00:28:35,252 --> 00:28:36,594
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually Kingdom Hearts manga.

428
00:28:36,794 --> 00:28:44,180
[SPEAKER_03]: They could do a CG, like, anime, because this game, I mean, basically cel-shaded CG anyways, and it looks really good.

429
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it looks very realistic to, you know, true to the animated series that they're pulling from.

430
00:28:50,485 --> 00:28:54,048
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, oh my god, it would make one hell of a kick-ass movie.

431
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:56,550
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be one franchise Disney would

432
00:28:57,048 --> 00:28:58,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine Disney, but with a more mature storyline to it.

433
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,170
[SPEAKER_04]: and you get to interact with it and be in it.

434
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,031
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the great thing about this game.

435
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:31,553
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was kind of like, hmm, sounds interesting.

436
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:39,120
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of interesting to try and explain Kingdom Hearts and I'm thinking, you get to interact with Winnie the Pooh in Mulan.

437
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:43,824
[SPEAKER_00]: The games are a lot more hardcore than that.

438
00:29:44,044 --> 00:29:44,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

439
00:29:45,345 --> 00:29:46,747
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's so hard to explain.

440
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

441
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:49,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

442
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:50,921
[SPEAKER_04]: More comments from chat room.

443
00:29:50,961 --> 00:29:52,122
[SPEAKER_04]: More, more, more.

444
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:56,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirty Thief theorizes Kingdom Hearts 3 could be a theatrical sequel for the movies.

445
00:29:56,163 --> 00:29:57,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that's what I'm hoping for.

446
00:29:58,244 --> 00:30:05,066
[SPEAKER_04]: GS191 says, I would be okay with a Kingdom Hearts MMO, but do a damn true sequel to Super Mario RPG first.

447
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:06,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

448
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

449
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:08,408
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we need.

450
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:10,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw this Paper Mario crap.

451
00:30:10,671 --> 00:30:12,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I am done with Paper Mario.

452
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:15,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a goddamn Super Mario RPG 2.

453
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:18,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Just remake the whole damn thing.

454
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:21,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirty Thief in our chatroom says everyone's going to be a Keyblade holder if you do a

455
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:23,325
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

456
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be a perfect MMO, but what do I know?

457
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't design them.

458
00:30:56,712 --> 00:30:59,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Tigerclaw says, hey, how about a Super Mario MMO, huh?

459
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:02,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirty Thief says he has a way to explain Kingdom Hearts.

460
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:03,982
[SPEAKER_04]: You like Disney?

461
00:31:04,222 --> 00:31:05,284
[SPEAKER_04]: You like Final Fantasy?

462
00:31:05,704 --> 00:31:06,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Play it.

463
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:08,304
[SPEAKER_04]: April Fool's Day

464
00:31:23,642 --> 00:31:27,506
[SPEAKER_04]: April Fool's is actually against my religion, so I don't really practice April Fool's.

465
00:31:27,746 --> 00:31:29,968
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll notice Orange Lawns Radio, we did no April Fool's gag.

466
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:32,350
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be no gag in tonight's program, I'm sorry.

467
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:36,253
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a gag last year, but it was stupid and obvious.

468
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:43,359
[SPEAKER_04]: And we thought about doing them this year, but then we realized, or at least I was realizing... We're just too lazy and procrastinate too much.

469
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,705
[SPEAKER_04]: In the time it takes to set up an April Fool's prank, I could be doing something more constructive for the website in the long term.

470
00:31:49,765 --> 00:31:51,066
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the one we did on DDR Freak.

471
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:52,569
[SPEAKER_04]: We changed it into Rot 13.

472
00:31:58,948 --> 00:32:07,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I have to admit, as it's been with the past three years of the DDR freak April Fool's prank, I click, I go to the site, I roll my eyes, I go somewhere else.

473
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,571
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been my April Fool's visits.

474
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:12,291
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lax in my moderator duties yesterday.

475
00:32:12,411 --> 00:32:13,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was.

476
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,352
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, I think the Blizzard ones have been the best.

477
00:32:16,372 --> 00:32:17,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Blizzard has had some good ones.

478
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:20,933
[SPEAKER_04]: The Panda Express or Pandaren Express, whatever it was in their name.

479
00:32:20,993 --> 00:32:21,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see this one?

480
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:22,214
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

481
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:24,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the new alliance class is the Wisp.

482
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:26,195
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not the Wisp.

483
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Burger Craft?

484
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:28,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

485
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:32,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And their new fast food chain that they're going to... That was hilarious.

486
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:33,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's great.

487
00:32:35,317 --> 00:32:38,140
[SPEAKER_04]: What were some other great April Fool's pranks played out there on the internet?

488
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:40,083
[SPEAKER_03]: GameFAQs telling you not to cheat.

489
00:32:41,224 --> 00:32:46,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, my favorite one... Another site that I moderate on is Gorillas Unofficial.

490
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,332
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was actually my favorite prank.

491
00:32:49,493 --> 00:32:49,673
[SPEAKER_00]: And I...

492
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:51,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-huh.

493
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:16,657
[SPEAKER_00]: for anyone who keeps up with the whole Gorillaz fandom saying that Paula was rejoining Gorillaz and that Noodle was out of the picture for a while and I was like, oh yeah!

494
00:33:16,717 --> 00:33:20,123
[SPEAKER_00]: I just loved watching everybody going, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

495
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:21,084
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sitting there going...

496
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,836
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny is I read about that on the Wikipedia.

497
00:33:24,856 --> 00:33:28,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Wikipedia had a giant list of every April Fool's prank on the internet yesterday.

498
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:30,438
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was on there.

499
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:31,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Girls Unofficial Prank.

500
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved Slashdot's prank.

501
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:37,000
[SPEAKER_04]: They turned the site pink and was like, you know, my little pony.

502
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:42,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Just nerdy stuff that was cute.

503
00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:47,426
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually, nobody got my prank because people, I guess, believed it and didn't comment on it.

504
00:33:48,346 --> 00:33:49,427
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I knew it was a prank.

505
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:50,808
[SPEAKER_04]: The one in your LJ?

506
00:33:50,968 --> 00:33:56,272
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that I was leaving my job next month to be a writer for a holistic magazine.

507
00:33:56,513 --> 00:33:58,054
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what my reaction was to that?

508
00:33:58,154 --> 00:34:00,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I went, I read it, I rolled my eyes and went to the next story.

509
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:01,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even read it.

510
00:34:01,436 --> 00:34:03,318
[SPEAKER_00]: But people believed mine from two years ago.

511
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:04,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one was that?

512
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:06,160
[SPEAKER_00]: When I said I was moving to Washington.

513
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:08,193
[SPEAKER_04]: because you'd threatened to do it before.

514
00:34:08,273 --> 00:34:12,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Dan's been wanting to move us to Washington now for like the past five years.

515
00:34:13,836 --> 00:34:17,078
[SPEAKER_04]: The very first episode of this program you said something about moving to Washington.

516
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:17,919
[SPEAKER_04]: That hasn't happened yet.

517
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:18,619
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't go.

518
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,299
[SPEAKER_00]: You have this show.

519
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:20,100
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go.

520
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,321
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can do a spin-off in Washington.

521
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,883
[SPEAKER_03]: A spin-off will be called It's Raining Here.

522
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:29,225
[SPEAKER_00]: It's raining rain.

523
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:30,966
[SPEAKER_00]: We should, though, bring up our announcement.

524
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:32,187
[SPEAKER_00]: About what?

525
00:34:33,456 --> 00:34:34,356
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an announcement.

526
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:35,277
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a fool's print.

527
00:34:35,297 --> 00:34:35,737
[SPEAKER_04]: This is legit.

528
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:42,700
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real, honest to God, or whoever you believe in, announcement.

529
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:48,583
[SPEAKER_00]: We are doing two panels at Fonamay this year in San Jose.

530
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:50,304
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be getting dates and everything.

531
00:34:50,324 --> 00:34:51,664
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be putting it up on our website.

532
00:34:51,904 --> 00:34:52,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Memorial Day weekend, right?

533
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:55,206
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Memorial Day weekend, last weekend in May.

534
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:57,765
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be there with two panels.

535
00:34:58,126 --> 00:35:00,130
[SPEAKER_00]: One for sure is on podcasting.

536
00:35:01,092 --> 00:35:02,496
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be doing full-on presentations.

537
00:35:02,556 --> 00:35:03,378
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be cosplaying.

538
00:35:04,844 --> 00:35:05,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I might too.

539
00:35:05,985 --> 00:35:07,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some ideas on what I want to do.

540
00:35:07,525 --> 00:35:17,809
[SPEAKER_00]: I am actually taking a suggestion by one of our long-time listeners, DJ Ranma S, and I am cosplaying Tamari from Naruto, like everybody else in the universe freaking cosplays Naruto.

541
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an idea for cosplay, but I'll tell you off air.

542
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's easy, and I think it's cute, and we could all do it.

543
00:35:22,952 --> 00:35:30,835
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I had another idea, because Tim, who came over, gave us Resident Evil Stars Airsoft Guns with Laser Sights.

544
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan and I have been shooting each other all day.

545
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:34,362
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic.

546
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:38,024
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sort of thinking about reviving the Jill costume, but I'm not sure.

547
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:38,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

548
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:43,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're about like 40 minutes into the show and we haven't even gotten to the first story yet, so we have to keep moving.

549
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:43,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Video games?

550
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:44,488
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell?

551
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:45,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Fandomaze is going to be happening.

552
00:35:45,528 --> 00:35:46,449
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're doing podcasting and what?

553
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:47,730
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one is just gaming?

554
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaming.

555
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,391
[SPEAKER_04]: E3 wrap-up or something?

556
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:49,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

557
00:35:49,911 --> 00:35:50,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.

558
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:53,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it will be right after E3, so yeah, that'll be...

559
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:54,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so check that out.

560
00:35:54,882 --> 00:35:55,522
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be awesome.

561
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:55,902
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be there.

562
00:35:55,942 --> 00:35:58,484
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll probably be giving stuff out too and all that good stuff.

563
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:02,626
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be doing, I know for sure that our panel, one of them is on Saturday.

564
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:05,528
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be getting official times as soon as they're given to me by my contact.

565
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:05,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.

566
00:36:06,128 --> 00:36:07,469
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll post all that info on the website.

567
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:11,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to Faname for inviting us and letting us ruin your con.

568
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:16,154
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no Rob is Manfei.

569
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:17,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Manfei has been done.

570
00:36:17,295 --> 00:36:19,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something in the chat room there?

571
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:22,714
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 Magus brought that up.

572
00:36:23,074 --> 00:36:23,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to be Manfei.

573
00:36:23,854 --> 00:36:31,058
[SPEAKER_00]: For any cosplayers, Manfei is this guy who's not very attractive cosplaying Fei from Cowboy Bebop.

574
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:32,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it doesn't work.

575
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, Ranma's offering to send me the Black Mage costume I wore at Katsukan.

576
00:36:37,242 --> 00:36:37,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

577
00:36:38,103 --> 00:36:42,665
[SPEAKER_04]: If you listen to the first 30 minutes of the show, you know where my fanboyism is right now.

578
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:45,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So fill in the blanks.

579
00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:48,248
[SPEAKER_04]: You can guess what I probably have planned for the cast of OLR.

580
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:48,809
[SPEAKER_03]: You're...

581
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIII is going to be a surprise at May's E3.

582
00:37:13,704 --> 00:37:20,307
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a brief teaser video and confirmation from the publisher that the RPG will be a PlayStation 3 exclusive.

583
00:37:20,647 --> 00:37:23,729
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, now, 1UP published this on March 30th of 06.

584
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:25,990
[SPEAKER_04]: People were saying it was an early April Fool's joke.

585
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:34,714
[SPEAKER_04]: But 1UP, and in fact, even Square Enix came out and said, Don't forget that people like to play April Fool's pranks around this time of year.

586
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:40,176
[SPEAKER_04]: But 1UP published another story that said, No, Square Enix is trying to deflect.

587
00:37:40,636 --> 00:37:42,437
[SPEAKER_04]: We have inside sources that says this is going to happen.

588
00:37:44,507 --> 00:37:58,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was followed up by Game Informer saying, while there have been numerous rumors about Final Fantasy XIII, Square Enix has never released any information about the title.

589
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:05,393
[SPEAKER_03]: The recent online article stating that the title being exclusive for PlayStation 3 and Shona A3 is not based on any official information obtained by us.

590
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:18,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the readers will remember April Fool's Day is tomorrow and many print and online outlets pull pranks every year before they get their hopes crushed by a joke.

591
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:20,939
[SPEAKER_03]: So, still rumor.

592
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:26,162
[SPEAKER_04]: And 1up.com ran a follow-up story that said, nope, Square Enix is just trying to deflect.

593
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:28,403
[SPEAKER_04]: We have inside sources that says this is the real deal.

594
00:38:29,163 --> 00:38:31,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think, logically...

595
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:38,951
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know Final Fantasy 13 is going to happen on PlayStation 3 because, let's see, you had 7, 8, 9 on PlayStation, 10, 11, 12 on PlayStation 2.

596
00:38:42,423 --> 00:38:44,024
[SPEAKER_04]: 13, 14, 15 on PlayStation 3.

597
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems pretty logical.

598
00:38:45,244 --> 00:38:48,805
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had the first three on the NES and the second three on the SNES.

599
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:49,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly right.

600
00:38:49,706 --> 00:38:50,206
[SPEAKER_04]: They've always... 3, 3, 3.

601
00:38:50,326 --> 00:38:56,008
[SPEAKER_04]: The only big shock was that they moved from Nintendo to Sony, but that's years old news.

602
00:38:56,028 --> 00:39:00,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And the graphic comes out on the stupid GameCube.

603
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,810
[SPEAKER_04]: And 10, 2, I'm not even counting any of that.

604
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not counting any of that.

605
00:39:04,795 --> 00:39:06,917
[SPEAKER_04]: It's inevitable we're getting Final Fantasy XIII on PlayStation 3.

606
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:10,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be hard to talk me out of that notion.

607
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's what the problem is.

608
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:18,665
[SPEAKER_04]: The surprise is, XII's not even out on shelves over here yet, so to announce XIII seems a little... Well, here's what I don't like.

609
00:39:18,685 --> 00:39:24,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like people ruining surprises like this, for one, because, yeah, of course they're always going to have something that they're surprising everybody with.

610
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:31,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, we probably know stuff that we can surprise people with that I haven't heard about yet, but obviously you can't say anything about it until E3, so... Yeah.

611
00:39:34,861 --> 00:39:36,183
[SPEAKER_04]: E3, Final Fantasy XII, Will in the United States

612
00:39:48,723 --> 00:39:49,964
[SPEAKER_04]: They just released Kingdom Hearts.

613
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:52,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think XI has any life left in it.

614
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:54,566
[SPEAKER_04]: And their expansion's coming out.

615
00:39:54,606 --> 00:39:57,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll be the last one.

616
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:59,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get hate mail.

617
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,510
[SPEAKER_04]: All that crap that they showed last year that never came out.

618
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to get hate mail from the Final Fantasy XI fans.

619
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:08,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying I think this next expansion is the last one.

620
00:40:08,593 --> 00:40:09,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see them doing another one after this.

621
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:11,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they've done three expansions now.

622
00:40:11,654 --> 00:40:13,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Rise of the Zillert technically was an expansion.

623
00:40:13,655 --> 00:40:15,336
[SPEAKER_04]: We just got it for free here in the US.

624
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:15,796
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

625
00:40:16,598 --> 00:40:18,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet one more will be coming out and that's about it.

626
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:20,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a new MMO will replace it.

627
00:40:21,341 --> 00:40:22,581
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just my thoughts.

628
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:23,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway.

629
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:29,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I know some buddies of mine were in town this weekend and one thing they did today was go shopping for an Xbox 360.

630
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:32,747
[SPEAKER_04]: And why would today be the day for that, Loki?

631
00:40:32,787 --> 00:40:44,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Today would be the day because everyone has been hoarding them up because all those increased shipments, Best Buy and Target and stores like such were doing their, I guess, third launch of the system.

632
00:40:45,014 --> 00:40:51,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Best Buy's had 60 systems per store and I think it was similar over at Target and whatnot.

633
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,199
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're out there.

634
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:53,801
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find them now, finally.

635
00:41:04,738 --> 00:41:05,338
[SPEAKER_04]: They're crazy.

636
00:41:05,378 --> 00:41:06,918
[SPEAKER_04]: They drove by at like 3 a.m.

637
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:08,459
[SPEAKER_04]: to make sure there wasn't going to be a line.

638
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they came back, went to bed, and went right before it opened.

639
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,940
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure enough, he got there and got a premium system.

640
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said they had 80 in stock.

641
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:18,261
[SPEAKER_04]: They still have some there right now.

642
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:23,082
[SPEAKER_04]: He called a little bit ago because I think he wanted to take it back because he was afraid something was wrong with it.

643
00:41:23,142 --> 00:41:23,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

644
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:24,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been following the whole thing.

645
00:41:24,622 --> 00:41:25,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll grill him in Part B.

646
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they apparently still have a bunch in stock.

647
00:41:29,939 --> 00:41:31,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not just Best Buy doing this.

648
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,341
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop was going to release a bunch today as well.

649
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:35,401
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop had some.

650
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:35,621
[SPEAKER_04]: EB.

651
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:38,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think somebody else was doing this too.

652
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:44,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I overheard GameStop earlier this week when I picked up Far Cry that they were going to be having more in.

653
00:41:45,326 --> 00:41:46,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great.

654
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:55,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's great because now we'll see some better games come out because some of the publishers have been pushing back their games because they're afraid that there's not many units out there to sell their games.

655
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:55,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

656
00:41:56,584 --> 00:41:59,746
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the whole Splinter Cell Double Agent got pushed back to September.

657
00:41:59,966 --> 00:42:02,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this mean the shortage is over of Xbox 360s?

658
00:42:02,427 --> 00:42:02,827
[SPEAKER_04]: This is it?

659
00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:03,268
[SPEAKER_04]: The end?

660
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:04,408
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting better.

661
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:05,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it that way.

662
00:42:05,629 --> 00:42:05,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

663
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:08,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I know our company is selling them in May.

664
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:11,092
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have them for sure in May in all of our warehouses.

665
00:42:11,992 --> 00:42:14,433
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get them like $5 cheaper than retail.

666
00:42:14,694 --> 00:42:15,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just asking.

667
00:42:15,154 --> 00:42:17,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we declare the shortage officially over now?

668
00:42:18,504 --> 00:42:24,726
[SPEAKER_04]: When 80 Xbox 360s are sitting there in Best Buy and there's still some on the shelf halfway through the day, does that mean the shortage is over?

669
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, well, think about it this way.

670
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:30,849
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be getting maybe about half that next week.

671
00:42:31,129 --> 00:42:34,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so they're going to start getting them regularly on the shelves.

672
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't have one yet, now you can probably get one.

673
00:42:37,831 --> 00:42:42,013
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a good time, too, because you're starting to get, you know, the games are starting to slow down a little bit.

674
00:42:42,113 --> 00:42:44,294
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's kind of dip in the year.

675
00:42:45,112 --> 00:42:46,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's plenty of good titles out right now.

676
00:42:47,673 --> 00:42:51,075
[SPEAKER_03]: March was a great month, so go for it.

677
00:43:07,222 --> 00:43:17,007
[SPEAKER_04]: This is floating around the internet this week where Iwata over at Nintendo is saying that the simultaneous global revolution launch is not going to be likely.

678
00:43:17,448 --> 00:43:24,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, we don't think it's necessary to do the simultaneous worldwide launch simply because others are doing this.

679
00:43:26,072 --> 00:43:30,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony, of course, is doing this big thing where they're going to do a worldwide launch and they're supposed to be region free and all that stuff.

680
00:43:31,115 --> 00:43:34,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's saying, maybe we don't need to do this same thing.

681
00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:57,263
[SPEAKER_04]: so could that mean that the revolution comes out in Japan this year and we still have to wait I hope not I think it's going to be out in both markets for the end of the year are we talking two week difference month difference who knows I think they'll launch it worldwide if they have the amount you know the units to do it I mean because why not but if they don't big deal

682
00:43:58,328 --> 00:44:09,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the unfortunate thing is that some of the countries are probably going to get the shaft, that usually tend to get the shaft when it comes to these launches, like Australia, sorry guys.

683
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:20,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those other countries that aren't the US, Japan, and Europe, and even Europe gets the shaft half the time, probably aren't going to see this at the same time, which is too bad.

684
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:21,187
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unfortunate.

685
00:44:21,207 --> 00:44:22,548
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

686
00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:23,309
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

687
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:25,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

688
00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:31,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go over to Loki, who has another follow-up story there on the Revolution.

689
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:54,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, kind of tying in with the whole Revolution being cheaper than the competition out there, the Revolution first-party games are going to be seeing a price tag of basically $50 or less, which, you know, good and all, but I don't think it's too impressive because if you look at the first-party 360 games, those are also $50, so I don't know.

690
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:13,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully that'll kind of start the trend of games being a little bit cheaper, but since, you know, obviously the development costs are going to be less than, you know, developing for the 360 and the PlayStation 3, I could definitely see them having, you know, cheaper games.

691
00:45:14,883 --> 00:45:19,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, it would be kind of stupid to release the least expensive system and then the most expensive games.

692
00:45:20,071 --> 00:45:21,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this kind of makes sense.

693
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:28,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo's, I think, trying to affirm that, yes, we're going to be the cheapest system when this thing releases.

694
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:34,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think their games have to match that, is that the games have to stay competitive.

695
00:45:34,786 --> 00:45:35,367
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're right.

696
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:37,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not that competitive.

697
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:43,535
[SPEAKER_04]: If they'd come out and said, no game under $40 or even $30, now that would be, whoa, that would be something else.

698
00:45:45,741 --> 00:45:57,365
[SPEAKER_04]: In not so much console gaming news, but going on to a certainly big gaming event that's happening this month, right around DarkSakura's birthday, we have the Silent Hill movie coming out, right?

699
00:45:57,725 --> 00:46:05,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's actually a little bit of talk from Roger Avery, who is the author of the screenplay for the Silent Hill movie.

700
00:46:06,228 --> 00:46:10,429
[SPEAKER_00]: He has basically tried to give his assurances that it will be

701
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:16,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much based around the actual games, which a lot of us who've been looking into this have heard him say already.

702
00:46:17,836 --> 00:46:30,259
[SPEAKER_00]: But he did speak to a reporter in Hollywood recently and he's quoted saying, And I knew how passionate the video game fans are for Silent Hill.

703
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:32,539
[SPEAKER_00]: At the minimum, we didn't want to piss them off.

704
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:34,200
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make this movie for them.

705
00:46:36,942 --> 00:46:42,187
[SPEAKER_00]: He also mentioned that it isn't always that way with video game tie-ins.

706
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:48,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Another quote from him says, Hollywood executives are very quick to throw out the source material of the game.

707
00:46:48,874 --> 00:46:49,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Doom kills me.

708
00:46:50,176 --> 00:46:52,558
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one of the movies I wanted to do so badly.

709
00:46:52,658 --> 00:46:56,202
[SPEAKER_00]: I met with them early on and I looked at the original script and asked them, where's the doom in this?

710
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:00,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the doom in this will be the box office.

711
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you remember the first person shooter part?

712
00:47:03,802 --> 00:47:08,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at any rate, I do also have a UK release date for the movie.

713
00:47:09,765 --> 00:47:10,945
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be out on April 25th.

714
00:47:11,086 --> 00:47:12,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's not much of a delay.

715
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:13,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much of a delay at all.

716
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:15,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Ours is the 21st.

717
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:20,110
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nothing for standard movie delays, so awesome.

718
00:47:21,531 --> 00:47:23,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I've said this on the show before, I'll say it again.

719
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:40,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I think when we were lucky enough to go to Konami Gamers Day a few months ago to have Akira Yamaoka sitting next to Christoph Gans introducing the trailer together saying, we are bringing this to you, and Akira Yamaoka of course being the producer of the last two Silent Hill games and doing all the music for all of them.

720
00:47:41,707 --> 00:47:44,408
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, Christoph Gans being the director, I think that spoke volumes right there.

721
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:45,989
[SPEAKER_04]: That they're working together.

722
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,290
[SPEAKER_04]: They're presenting this together.

723
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think you ever saw that happen with previous games.

724
00:47:50,431 --> 00:47:58,335
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sure, maybe they say nice things about each other before the movie came out, and then after the movie comes out, they all distance themselves from each other and blame each other for the movie sucking.

725
00:47:58,616 --> 00:48:05,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how they, like, explain, you know, the differences between... Obviously, this movie's based on the first and third games.

726
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:11,322
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like how they explain the differences between why the main character is a female instead of male.

727
00:48:11,813 --> 00:48:34,831
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that and it made a lot of sense and it's not like oh well we did this because uh we get this actress or you know we did this because we wanted explosions or you know something stupid so I definitely am confident that this will finally be a Sean Bean a good movie you get the sense that this movie is a little more Japanese than any other

728
00:48:35,427 --> 00:48:36,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Movie We've Gotten Yet.

729
00:48:56,370 --> 00:49:00,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, we might be a little bit more mellow since it'll be the day after.

730
00:49:00,051 --> 00:49:00,611
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's true.

731
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:01,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be hungover.

732
00:49:03,532 --> 00:49:05,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you have a follow-up relating to Silent Hill.

733
00:49:05,972 --> 00:49:10,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course, to tie in with the movie release, Konami's announced a few things.

734
00:49:11,153 --> 00:49:14,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, he previously announced Silent Hill Experience.

735
00:49:14,934 --> 00:49:16,675
[SPEAKER_03]: That one actually has a date now.

736
00:49:16,715 --> 00:49:22,216
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming out, well, maybe a little bit after the movie, on May 28th.

737
00:49:23,796 --> 00:49:31,321
[SPEAKER_03]: which is actually, if I remember correctly, the same day as the Metal Gear Solid Digital Comic, which, you know, same week there.

738
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:32,842
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of cool.

739
00:49:33,182 --> 00:49:42,348
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's basically, you know, a bunch of digital comics and music and some, you know, backstory to some of the Silent Hill games, kind of tying it all together nicely for the PSP.

740
00:49:42,648 --> 00:49:52,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, also announced is the Silent Hill Collection for the PlayStation 2, which is including games 2 through 4, and that's slated for April 13th.

741
00:49:53,311 --> 00:49:55,213
[SPEAKER_03]: About a week or so before the movie.

742
00:49:56,794 --> 00:49:58,455
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what we need is the Game Boy one.

743
00:50:00,357 --> 00:50:01,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep forgetting about that one.

744
00:50:01,758 --> 00:50:03,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we never got it over here.

745
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:04,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe it would be a bonus or something.

746
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:06,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Could be like a bonus unlockable, who knows.

747
00:50:07,663 --> 00:50:08,083
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

748
00:50:08,644 --> 00:50:13,468
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't actually found the translation of it outside of, you know, FAQ format.

749
00:50:14,228 --> 00:50:14,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Been hunting it.

750
00:50:15,103 --> 00:50:18,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of movies, you know I got invited to go see Stay Alive this weekend.

751
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:18,805
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

752
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:19,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I turned it down.

753
00:50:21,287 --> 00:50:25,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah, I know I do the show on video games and stuff but I just really don't want to see it.

754
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though somebody gave it a not-so-bad review.

755
00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:30,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't we get a not-so-bad review in the mailbag last week?

756
00:50:30,971 --> 00:50:33,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I still just... I'll wait for Netflix.

757
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:34,794
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something I can make myself go see.

758
00:50:35,535 --> 00:50:40,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody was mentioning it in chatroom right now, so I just wanted to drop that.

759
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:41,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to other gaming news.

760
00:50:42,461 --> 00:50:43,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Bros.

761
00:50:43,381 --> 00:50:43,842
[SPEAKER_04]: DS.

762
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,105
[SPEAKER_04]: It was announced a little while ago, and they keep pushing it back.

763
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:47,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what?

764
00:50:47,785 --> 00:50:49,707
[SPEAKER_04]: It got pushed back one more time.

765
00:50:49,827 --> 00:50:53,370
[SPEAKER_04]: May 21st, over on the game's homepage, is when they say this game's coming out.

766
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:56,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's not too bad of a delay because it was only a week.

767
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:05,261
[SPEAKER_04]: However, now people are theorizing that, hmm, could this be because the DS Lite is being positioned somewhere around here?

768
00:51:05,602 --> 00:51:08,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of course Super Mario is probably going to be the next big...

769
00:51:09,265 --> 00:51:11,786
[SPEAKER_04]: DS game after this Tetris Metroid combo we got.

770
00:51:12,066 --> 00:51:15,886
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe the light is being positioned to be launched at the same time.

771
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,407
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a good packing game with the DS light.

772
00:51:18,447 --> 00:51:20,307
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be a very good packing game for the DS light.

773
00:51:20,347 --> 00:51:22,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe this is why the repositioning is happening.

774
00:51:22,868 --> 00:51:28,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we won't know the answers until E3, which is kind of a running theme across most of our stories over the next couple months.

775
00:51:29,749 --> 00:51:34,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything will be... It's like one of those movies or one of those games with a really contorted plot.

776
00:51:34,711 --> 00:51:36,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is explained at the end.

777
00:51:37,515 --> 00:51:39,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything will be explained at E3.

778
00:51:39,515 --> 00:51:41,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's not explained, we're going to be pissed.

779
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:51,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, and I was reminded by Illusion here, the other thing they announced was they're doing a Silent Hill game for the PSP, not the Silent Hill Experience on top of that.

780
00:51:51,198 --> 00:51:51,678
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

781
00:51:52,138 --> 00:51:52,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I read that too.

782
00:51:52,858 --> 00:51:54,859
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to do a whole new game on the PSP.

783
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:57,719
[SPEAKER_03]: The rumor is that it's supposed to be a remake of the first one.

784
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

785
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:01,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a remake of the first one with the characters from the movie?

786
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:06,681
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been actually hearing about a possibility of them doing the movie version of the game.

787
00:52:07,281 --> 00:52:10,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is ironic because I did that as my homework in Illustrator.

788
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:14,804
[SPEAKER_04]: And you also posted a recent homework thing to our forums, huh?

789
00:52:14,844 --> 00:52:18,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a scary little thing that made me jump out of my chair when I clicked on it.

790
00:52:18,306 --> 00:52:18,726
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

791
00:52:19,646 --> 00:52:22,967
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll post it in the chat room.

792
00:52:23,528 --> 00:52:26,149
[SPEAKER_00]: For my Flash homework, we were supposed to animate a banner.

793
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:29,410
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is, not a banner, but animate an ad.

794
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:31,411
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start working on our new website.

795
00:52:45,864 --> 00:52:51,888
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to be doing a Splash Forest within the next couple of months because my spring break is actually next month.

796
00:52:52,089 --> 00:52:52,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

797
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:59,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to hear Silent Hill is coming to the PSP because I think that's one of those franchises you can't really do on the DS as well as you can the PSP.

798
00:52:59,534 --> 00:53:06,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the PSP's technology with the movies, I think it'll lend itself a lot better to the Silent Hill franchise than the DS would.

799
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:11,464
[SPEAKER_04]: That's me tossing the PSP fans that say I rip on the PSP too much.

800
00:53:11,804 --> 00:53:13,085
[SPEAKER_04]: That's me tossing you guys a bone there.

801
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Silent Hill will kick butt.

802
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:16,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they could do it on the DS as well.

803
00:53:16,446 --> 00:53:17,726
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't rip on the PSP fans.

804
00:53:17,766 --> 00:53:20,607
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a whole page dedicated to the PSP.

805
00:53:20,647 --> 00:53:21,368
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

806
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:21,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

807
00:53:22,128 --> 00:53:22,808
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole website.

808
00:53:23,428 --> 00:53:24,749
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple weeks ago they were getting vicious.

809
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:25,949
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

810
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:32,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, now the 360 has kind of gotten a cold shoulder in Japan.

811
00:53:32,872 --> 00:53:33,792
[SPEAKER_04]: People kind of don't care.

812
00:53:34,413 --> 00:53:36,834
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's Microsoft going to do to try and make people care?

813
00:53:36,974 --> 00:53:37,974
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to do over.

814
00:53:39,107 --> 00:53:40,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get a do-over?

815
00:53:40,448 --> 00:53:47,853
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to relaunch the 360 in Japan on, well, the rumor date right now is June 29th.

816
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:56,498
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to coincide with many of the new games coming out, especially one of my favorites, Chromehounds, is going to be coming around that time.

817
00:53:57,159 --> 00:53:58,800
[SPEAKER_03]: But some better games will be out by then.

818
00:53:59,941 --> 00:54:03,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see how you can actually do over a launch.

819
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:05,404
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just pretend it doesn't happen.

820
00:54:05,484 --> 00:54:06,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like,

821
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,321
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to put more systems out there and go, hey look, we're here still.

822
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:12,997
[SPEAKER_04]: SUPER JAPANESE HAPPY CONSOLE!

823
00:54:40,265 --> 00:54:41,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Play all your favorite games!

824
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:43,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

825
00:54:43,506 --> 00:54:44,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

826
00:54:44,967 --> 00:54:46,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it'll be that bad.

827
00:54:47,668 --> 00:54:48,488
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

828
00:54:48,648 --> 00:54:49,408
[SPEAKER_00]: 360, I choose you.

829
00:54:51,729 --> 00:54:52,049
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

830
00:54:52,609 --> 00:55:00,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we're traveling abroad right now, DarkSakura likes to travel the world from her computer and tell us what's going on in the UK for our buddies over there overseas.

831
00:55:00,312 --> 00:55:00,632
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

832
00:55:00,812 --> 00:55:02,272
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so friggin' international.

833
00:55:03,753 --> 00:55:06,834
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been an update to the World of Warcraft downloader.

834
00:55:08,564 --> 00:55:13,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we've had a bunch of players saying, Blizzard, no.

835
00:55:14,865 --> 00:55:26,328
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually did a change with a patch of 1.10 that's meaning the downloader will run constantly even if the program is closed.

836
00:55:28,168 --> 00:55:35,850
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a quote on here from one of the World of Warcraft players from the forums.

837
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:46,082
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was playing Wednesday morning after installing the 1.0 patch, and in the middle of playing my firewall says the Blizzard downloader is still trying to make an outgoing connection.

838
00:55:47,022 --> 00:55:47,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

839
00:55:47,662 --> 00:55:48,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Stealing bandwidth.

840
00:55:48,742 --> 00:55:49,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Not good.

841
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:50,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

842
00:55:50,602 --> 00:55:51,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I heard about the new patch.

843
00:55:51,903 --> 00:55:53,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was a worldwide thing, of course.

844
00:55:53,763 --> 00:55:58,184
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, you know, things that happen in the UK and picked up over there often happen over here.

845
00:55:59,144 --> 00:56:00,884
[SPEAKER_04]: But I didn't know about that.

846
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:01,584
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.

847
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:04,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they're taking the BitTorrent method.

848
00:56:04,884 --> 00:56:08,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and they've done that before, but they didn't run in the background.

849
00:56:08,605 --> 00:56:09,766
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like the difference there.

850
00:56:10,406 --> 00:56:11,326
[SPEAKER_04]: You knew when it was running.

851
00:56:11,766 --> 00:56:12,286
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.

852
00:56:12,346 --> 00:56:17,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically, when you're done downloading the patch, the connection's going to stay open so that you can share with everybody else.

853
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,689
[SPEAKER_00]: You are becoming part of the whole network.

854
00:56:24,567 --> 00:56:50,787
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know all you're sending out is the patch content but a lot of people were saying that you know part of the agreement is that they never once agreed to offer up their services to Blizzard they're paying Blizzard for their services instead so Blizzard updated their downloader with an option that you can make it stop running in the background you can turn it off if you want to hmm

855
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:51,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

856
00:56:51,804 --> 00:56:57,034
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I honestly think that it was a very poor practice on their part.

857
00:56:57,315 --> 00:56:58,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I understand the logic behind it.

858
00:56:59,383 --> 00:57:00,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with such a huge patch.

859
00:57:01,064 --> 00:57:05,428
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really, I don't recall seeing anything to that effect in the user agreement.

860
00:57:05,788 --> 00:57:13,495
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll look back through it again, but I really don't believe that, and you allow yourself to, you know, your bandwidth to be used for Blizzard's own purposes.

861
00:57:13,915 --> 00:57:22,522
[SPEAKER_04]: But to Blizzard's credit, they've been making a lot of mistakes this year, because I can't help but think back to the, you know, politically-ish issue from a few months ago.

862
00:57:22,883 --> 00:57:26,486
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've been pretty good about coming up with really intelligent fixes, you know.

863
00:57:27,086 --> 00:57:31,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Not always the fastest way, but at least they fixed their mistakes, unlike some companies.

864
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,151
[SPEAKER_04]: So, gotta hand it to them there.

865
00:57:34,312 --> 00:57:34,672
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

866
00:57:35,292 --> 00:57:38,515
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a demo for Blazing Angels on the PC.

867
00:57:39,696 --> 00:57:47,842
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a 467 megabyte download available for the demo.

868
00:57:49,363 --> 00:57:54,467
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to train a biplane, fire around Dunkirk and London, shoot stuff.

869
00:57:55,528 --> 00:57:55,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Um...

870
00:57:56,874 --> 00:58:05,862
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go ahead and link the demo in the chat room, but it is available at 3dgamers.com slash games slash Blazing Angels.

871
00:58:07,163 --> 00:58:07,543
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

872
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:16,271
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a demo for Galactic Civ 2 by Stardock Corporation.

873
00:58:17,812 --> 00:58:21,095
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Galactic Civilizations 2 Dreadlords.

874
00:58:21,175 --> 00:58:23,597
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the sequel to, I guess, the first one.

875
00:58:24,395 --> 00:58:28,077
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's set in the future where you go into space.

876
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:36,882
[SPEAKER_00]: You have different factions that you choose from, different available options for customization.

877
00:58:38,663 --> 00:58:42,345
[SPEAKER_00]: The demo for this is also up at 3D Gamers.

878
00:58:43,105 --> 00:58:48,968
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to 3dgamers.com slash game slash galactic civ 2 slash downloads, you can find it there as well.

879
00:58:49,489 --> 00:58:50,609
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also link that in the chat room.

880
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:53,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

881
00:58:55,007 --> 00:59:20,868
[SPEAKER_00]: and the last one that I have is Nintendo is offering basically their European audience a chance to air their grievances basically there was such a long delay for Animal Crossing Wild World a lot of people got very upset over this in fact

882
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:33,375
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a website opened up called Nintendo of Europe Watch to basically go over a lot of the problems, including a Hall of Fame, a Hall of Shame for good and bad release schedules.

883
00:59:37,556 --> 00:59:44,779
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a few games that they mentioned that made it over there before they made it here first, like Another Code, which I had been waiting on for a while.

884
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,341
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are...

885
00:59:49,278 --> 00:59:52,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Delays from days to months.

886
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:57,920
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with the release schedules that I've announced, there's been lots of different changes going between them.

887
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:03,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to recall reading when I checked out that site that WarioWare Twisted was just coming out over there.

888
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:05,662
[SPEAKER_04]: And that game came out here last year.

889
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:07,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was a horrendous delay.

890
01:00:07,722 --> 01:00:12,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what caused that, but they didn't get that game for six, nine months after we got it.

891
01:00:13,004 --> 01:00:14,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is too bad, because it's kind of a cool game.

892
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,605
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's more interesting stuff on the DS now.

893
01:00:19,164 --> 01:00:20,725
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

894
01:00:20,765 --> 01:00:35,919
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would check out that site, Nintendo of Europe Watch, because it's a place to... I mean, it's basically giving people an opportunity to voice their concerns over the massive changes in... And even if you're in the US, you can see just how good you have it.

895
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

896
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:45,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we really... They've been pretty much on the level with us, but then again, we can go to Washington and knock on their door.

897
01:00:45,368 --> 01:00:45,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

898
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:49,667
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, at the same time, we sometimes feel like we have to wait for Japan to get it.

899
01:00:49,887 --> 01:00:50,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll get it.

900
01:00:50,887 --> 01:00:51,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Then Europe gets it.

901
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,648
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not on the top of the ladder either.

902
01:00:55,008 --> 01:00:55,228
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

903
01:00:55,628 --> 01:00:59,069
[SPEAKER_04]: But, of course, it depends on the type of game because, of course, we get some games before Japan does.

904
01:00:59,549 --> 01:01:00,789
[SPEAKER_04]: It all depends on who's making it.

905
01:01:01,469 --> 01:01:01,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

906
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:02,269
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

907
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:07,471
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last bit of news is release dates.

908
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:10,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Going over the upcoming release dates for this week.

909
01:01:12,292 --> 01:01:13,772
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are going to be on the 7th.

910
01:01:15,278 --> 01:01:34,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Death Jam Fight for New York, Hooray, Iron Warriors, Lara Croft Tomb Raider Legend, Magna Carta on PS2, Painkiller Hell Wars on Xbox, Polarium Advance on GBA, Top Spin 2, Auto Assault on PC, Dragon Quest VIII, Sims 2, Family Fun Stuff, Mega Man Battle Network 5.

911
01:01:43,427 --> 01:01:46,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't Def Jam Fight for New York come out here like a year ago?

912
01:01:46,809 --> 01:01:48,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I remember incessantly making fun of that title.

913
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:50,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

914
01:01:50,871 --> 01:01:51,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's PSP.

915
01:01:51,571 --> 01:01:52,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, never mind.

916
01:01:52,371 --> 01:01:52,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

917
01:01:53,152 --> 01:01:53,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Never mind.

918
01:01:55,093 --> 01:01:55,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I stand corrected.

919
01:01:56,934 --> 01:01:57,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

920
01:01:57,274 --> 01:01:59,055
[SPEAKER_04]: We also get Tomb Raider for us.

921
01:01:59,535 --> 01:01:59,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

922
01:01:59,835 --> 01:02:00,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that's one for you.

923
01:02:00,636 --> 01:02:01,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay?

924
01:02:01,436 --> 01:02:02,496
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is items.

925
01:02:02,597 --> 01:02:04,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray, the 20 millionth Tomb Raider game.

926
01:02:05,098 --> 01:02:08,439
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Tomb Raider 2 I actually liked for two things.

927
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,441
[SPEAKER_00]: One was locking the annoying butler in the freezer.

928
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:14,660
[SPEAKER_00]: And... Because then he didn't follow you around anymore in the house.

929
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,944
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second is hopping up on the balcony in her main room and making her jump off and break her neck.

930
01:02:20,364 --> 01:02:22,105
[SPEAKER_00]: How fun.

931
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:23,246
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also make her explode.

932
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:26,669
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a little button press code you could do to make her explode.

933
01:02:27,129 --> 01:02:27,669
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome.

934
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:28,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Eat Taco Bell?

935
01:02:29,651 --> 01:02:29,791
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

936
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:31,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's coming out in the U.S.?

937
01:02:32,273 --> 01:02:32,713
[SPEAKER_03]: The U.S.?

938
01:02:33,154 --> 01:02:33,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too much this week.

939
01:02:33,974 --> 01:02:34,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually pretty slow.

940
01:02:34,895 --> 01:02:38,357
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the PC, you've got full Spectrum Warrior 10 hammers.

941
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:39,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Only about a week late, but still pretty good.

942
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:41,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Also...

943
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:43,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, Double Dare 3?

944
01:02:43,849 --> 01:02:46,050
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty lame.

945
01:02:47,351 --> 01:02:51,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um... Yeah, so apparently not any... What, like the Nick show, Double Dare?

946
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:52,775
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nickelodeon?

947
01:02:53,055 --> 01:02:53,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

948
01:02:54,956 --> 01:02:56,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, okay, whatever.

949
01:02:56,858 --> 01:02:58,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, uh, not too much.

950
01:03:00,207 --> 01:03:06,036
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 2-wise, you've got MLB 2K6, same also coming out on the Xbox this week.

951
01:03:07,057 --> 01:03:14,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you've got for the PlayStation 2 Tourist Trophy, which is going to be the Gran Turismo of Motorcycles.

952
01:03:16,174 --> 01:03:21,538
[SPEAKER_03]: and Commando Strike Force on both PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

953
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:42,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, if you happen to be a fan of basketball games, NBA Ballers Phenoms finally coming out on PlayStation 2 and also on PSP from Russia with Love and Bust a Move Deluxe, which is pretty cool, and Kabbalah's Dangerous Hunts for the redneck in you.

954
01:03:42,475 --> 01:03:47,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a hard time believing Bust a Move Deluxe is cool because it's going to be the same fucking game on another system.

955
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:48,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

956
01:03:48,919 --> 01:03:50,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, how many times does that game have to come out?

957
01:03:50,901 --> 01:03:52,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go buy the Taito Collection.

958
01:03:52,822 --> 01:03:56,745
[SPEAKER_04]: And why did they have to steal the name of the, you know, popular dance game?

959
01:03:57,345 --> 01:03:58,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Puzzle Bobble was such a cuter name.

960
01:03:58,946 --> 01:03:59,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

961
01:04:00,247 --> 01:04:00,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupids.

962
01:04:01,528 --> 01:04:01,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

963
01:04:03,109 --> 01:04:06,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you like to play games an awful lot, you might be trying to set a new record.

964
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:12,275
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki, you know, Twin Galaxies, one of these big sites that tracks records, what are they up to?

965
01:04:12,895 --> 01:04:14,436
[SPEAKER_03]: They're up to no good, as usual.

966
01:04:15,637 --> 01:04:18,118
[SPEAKER_03]: What they're doing, actually, they have a couple things going on.

967
01:04:18,138 --> 01:04:20,639
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is they're actually holding a contest.

968
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:25,122
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Who's the Toughest Gun in Dodge City of Video Games.

969
01:04:26,298 --> 01:04:43,108
[SPEAKER_03]: and to kind of tie in with everything, there's going to be a bunch of contests being held, kind of demonstrations to see who can get the highest score in like Dig Dug, Donkey Kong, Gorf, Galaxin, Joust, Ms.

970
01:04:43,148 --> 01:04:52,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man, Q-Bert and Zookeeper and what they're also doing is they're tying this all into the 2007 Guinness Book of World Records and

971
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:58,994
[SPEAKER_03]: and actually that Twin Galaxies is going to be tied in with the Guinness Book.

972
01:04:59,014 --> 01:05:00,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So all these records will be going in the Guinness.

973
01:05:01,015 --> 01:05:01,696
[SPEAKER_04]: No Burger Time?

974
01:05:02,096 --> 01:05:02,477
[SPEAKER_03]: No Burger Time.

975
01:05:02,497 --> 01:05:02,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Worthless!

976
01:05:04,959 --> 01:05:06,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of funny, though.

977
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:12,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to laugh because the Qbert one, they actually have this one old woman that's going to be competing.

978
01:05:13,646 --> 01:05:16,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that Granny Hardcore, whatever her name is?

979
01:05:16,768 --> 01:05:19,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's one that... I can't remember her name.

980
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:21,512
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I saw it in the email I got from them.

981
01:05:22,102 --> 01:05:23,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man Pac-Man

982
01:05:52,517 --> 01:05:55,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Double Dare 3 is actually a Nancy Drew game.

983
01:06:22,014 --> 01:06:23,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Which makes it worse!

984
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:27,718
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted Mark Summers... I read Nancy Drew books when I was little.

985
01:06:28,098 --> 01:06:35,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted Mark Summers to have to explain, you know, the slime pit that he had to jump through and then get really freaked out by it because he was obsessive compulsive, right?

986
01:06:35,984 --> 01:06:36,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember?

987
01:06:36,444 --> 01:06:39,686
[SPEAKER_04]: We all saw the 2020... Dateline, whatever the hell it was, aired that special.

988
01:06:40,266 --> 01:06:40,947
[SPEAKER_04]: What does he do now?

989
01:06:40,967 --> 01:06:41,787
[SPEAKER_04]: What does Mark Summers do now?

990
01:06:41,828 --> 01:06:42,688
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a producer.

991
01:06:43,008 --> 01:06:46,331
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a host of a show called Unwrapped on Food Network.

992
01:06:46,631 --> 01:06:46,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay!

993
01:06:47,974 --> 01:06:48,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I should know that.

994
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:50,156
[SPEAKER_03]: You used to watch Food Network all the time.

995
01:06:50,176 --> 01:06:51,156
[SPEAKER_00]: He also was a producer.

996
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,397
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I actually saw him.

997
01:06:52,638 --> 01:06:55,400
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that show where they would play these massive pranks on people?

998
01:06:57,021 --> 01:06:57,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Candid Camera?

999
01:06:58,081 --> 01:06:59,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it wasn't that.

1000
01:06:59,562 --> 01:07:01,764
[SPEAKER_00]: It was another one, but he was... Punk'd?

1001
01:07:03,345 --> 01:07:04,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Mark Summers.

1002
01:07:05,727 --> 01:07:07,528
[SPEAKER_04]: You just got punk'd.

1003
01:07:07,748 --> 01:07:12,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they got him to host a show on there where they were destroying this guy's car.

1004
01:07:14,091 --> 01:07:18,995
[SPEAKER_00]: and, I mean, they really didn't destroy his car, they destroyed a duplicate of it, but it was pretty funny.

1005
01:07:19,055 --> 01:07:21,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, for everybody in chatroom yelling out, what would you do?

1006
01:07:21,997 --> 01:07:25,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hello and welcome to, like, ten years ago, okay?

1007
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,421
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what he's currently doing anymore.

1008
01:07:27,922 --> 01:07:30,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he, I think the pie pod is long gone.

1009
01:07:31,104 --> 01:07:31,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Pie pod.

1010
01:07:31,664 --> 01:07:32,845
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fucking sad, I know that.

1011
01:07:32,905 --> 01:07:33,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, um...

1012
01:07:35,205 --> 01:07:43,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week, big announcement from Game Developers Conference that Nintendo Revolution was going to have Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx games on it.

1013
01:07:43,072 --> 01:07:44,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the deal.

1014
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:47,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Hudson is saying that, oh, it gets better.

1015
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:54,121
[SPEAKER_04]: CD-ROM 2 CD games are also going to be on the Nintendo next-gen system.

1016
01:07:54,201 --> 01:07:58,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Snatcher, Night Trap, it might happen.

1017
01:07:59,105 --> 01:08:00,286
[SPEAKER_00]: My heart is happy.

1018
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:01,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And what, because the Dracula...

1019
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:07,582
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, Dracula X, Rondo of Blood, Sapphire, Strider.

1020
01:08:08,703 --> 01:08:11,785
[SPEAKER_04]: The one that they ported over to Super Nintendo that was crap on Super Nintendo.

1021
01:08:11,885 --> 01:08:16,627
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually was fun as a game, but when you played the original... Yep, it's poop.

1022
01:08:18,348 --> 01:08:20,570
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought it on the show one time and played it on the webcam, remember?

1023
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:23,371
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a long time ago.

1024
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:25,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I was back in the three hour live show days.

1025
01:08:26,113 --> 01:08:28,555
[SPEAKER_04]: When we could get away with doing stuff like that because nobody was listening.

1026
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:29,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

1027
01:08:31,883 --> 01:08:34,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what else is going to be cool about the revolution?

1028
01:08:34,305 --> 01:08:47,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know if this is cool, and this is just IGN, you know, with their exclusive on what they, I guess, found out is the specs on the up-and-coming revolution system.

1029
01:08:48,013 --> 01:08:59,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they're saying that it's clocked at, the CPU is clocked at about 729 megahertz, which in comparison is not quite twice that...

1030
01:09:00,715 --> 01:09:05,999
[SPEAKER_03]: from the Gecko CPU in the GameCube, but pretty close.

1031
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:17,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, that the Revolution GPU ATI Hollywood chip is going to be 243 MHz, which the GameCube GPU ran only at 162.

1032
01:09:17,188 --> 01:09:22,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, all this together, they said it's about as powerful as a current-gen Xbox.

1033
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:25,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1034
01:09:26,615 --> 01:09:27,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I mean...

1035
01:09:29,195 --> 01:09:29,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1036
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:33,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to see, because specs don't mean anything when it comes to games.

1037
01:09:34,179 --> 01:09:35,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have to see what the games look like before.

1038
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:42,865
[SPEAKER_04]: You could put the uber-processor of God in those machines, and it wouldn't matter if the games suck.

1039
01:09:43,506 --> 01:09:49,851
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's all about the games, and if that ends up being what the specs really are, Nintendo better put their games where their mouth is.

1040
01:09:49,911 --> 01:09:55,995
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all about the games, or what's the surprise, or element of surprise?

1041
01:09:56,015 --> 01:09:56,856
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that thing he kept saying?

1042
01:09:56,876 --> 01:09:56,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Game?

1043
01:09:57,678 --> 01:09:59,080
[SPEAKER_04]: at Game Developers Conference.

1044
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:00,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Games are meant to be one thing.

1045
01:10:01,142 --> 01:10:01,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun.

1046
01:10:01,582 --> 01:10:02,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun for everyone.

1047
01:10:02,523 --> 01:10:03,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprise.

1048
01:10:03,024 --> 01:10:03,484
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that thing?

1049
01:10:03,504 --> 01:10:04,645
[SPEAKER_04]: He said surprise element.

1050
01:10:04,706 --> 01:10:06,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Displacing the scene.

1051
01:10:06,447 --> 01:10:09,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what the hell the word was.

1052
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:09,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Disrupting.

1053
01:10:10,051 --> 01:10:10,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Disruption.

1054
01:10:10,732 --> 01:10:11,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Disruption.

1055
01:10:11,212 --> 01:10:11,713
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the word.

1056
01:10:12,854 --> 01:10:13,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Displacing?

1057
01:10:13,635 --> 01:10:14,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the hell was my mind?

1058
01:10:14,315 --> 01:10:15,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Disruption gaming.

1059
01:10:15,537 --> 01:10:18,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play your game!

1060
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,241
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like... Really?

1061
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:21,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1062
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:46,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And kudos to Bershaz, who was first in the chatroom to correct us there.

1063
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:49,356
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a slight delay between when we say things when the chatroom hears it.

1064
01:10:49,596 --> 01:10:52,078
[SPEAKER_04]: But he was the first to say, or she, sorry, I don't know.

1065
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:57,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Bershaz says the first to say disruptive gaming was the term there.

1066
01:10:58,397 --> 01:10:59,898
[SPEAKER_04]: used at the Game Developers Conference.

1067
01:11:00,218 --> 01:11:02,059
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, really quickly, we're going to wrap this segment up.

1068
01:11:02,099 --> 01:11:05,780
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a couple quick top ten stories that we're going to get to first.

1069
01:11:06,301 --> 01:11:09,962
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of Japan, we were talking a couple stories in this segment about Japan.

1070
01:11:10,402 --> 01:11:15,825
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't talked a whole lot about what their best-selling games are, but we thought tonight we'd run over their top ten sellers.

1071
01:11:16,225 --> 01:11:20,807
[SPEAKER_04]: No surprise there that Final Fantasy XII is at the top of their charts.

1072
01:11:21,307 --> 01:11:25,651
[SPEAKER_04]: In their second week, they've now sold over 2 million copies of Final Fantasy XII in Japan.

1073
01:11:25,691 --> 01:11:26,471
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty awesome.

1074
01:11:27,212 --> 01:11:29,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Also in the top 10, at number 10, Mario Kart DS.

1075
01:11:30,134 --> 01:11:39,622
[SPEAKER_04]: At number 9, and I apologize in advance for this horrible pronunciation, Haru Kanaru Toki no Uchi Day 3, Unmei no Mekuyu.

1076
01:11:40,022 --> 01:11:41,103
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's by Koei.

1077
01:11:41,123 --> 01:11:42,264
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a company that does that.

1078
01:11:43,004 --> 01:11:46,167
[SPEAKER_04]: So that must be another one of those Nobunaga Ambition type of games.

1079
01:11:46,187 --> 01:11:46,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1080
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:49,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 8, Brain Training for Adults.

1081
01:11:49,331 --> 01:11:50,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 7, English Training.

1082
01:11:51,151 --> 01:11:53,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 6, Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires.

1083
01:11:53,332 --> 01:11:54,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 5, Brain Training 2.

1084
01:11:55,213 --> 01:12:00,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 4, Animal Crossing Wild World in its 18th week on the Japanese charts.

1085
01:12:00,655 --> 01:12:01,295
[SPEAKER_04]: 2.2 million copies.

1086
01:12:01,695 --> 01:12:03,836
[SPEAKER_04]: At number 3, Ace Combat Zero, The Belkan War.

1087
01:12:03,916 --> 01:12:07,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 2, Pokemon Rangers Diamond and Pearl.

1088
01:12:07,897 --> 01:12:10,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And number 1, of course, was Final Fantasy 12 there.

1089
01:12:10,718 --> 01:12:11,419
[SPEAKER_04]: So very interesting.

1090
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:11,419
1, 2, 3.

1091
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:14,720
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 Brain Training games in the top 10 there.

1092
01:12:15,967 --> 01:12:17,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has not come out here.

1093
01:12:18,531 --> 01:12:21,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, now, Loki, you have another top ten of sorts.

1094
01:12:21,334 --> 01:12:25,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Top ten games being played on the Xbox 360 or live.

1095
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:28,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of questioning the whole live bit of it when you'll find out.

1096
01:12:29,604 --> 01:12:32,907
[SPEAKER_03]: First one, of course, being Halo 2 at the top of the list.

1097
01:12:33,407 --> 01:12:37,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two is Oblivion, which I don't understand how that'd be played on Xbox Live.

1098
01:12:37,171 --> 01:12:38,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that an April Fool's joke, maybe?

1099
01:12:38,852 --> 01:12:44,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Because either it's got to be just counting the time that you're signed in, actually playing the game.

1100
01:12:44,096 --> 01:12:44,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It must be that.

1101
01:12:45,077 --> 01:12:49,221
[SPEAKER_04]: But in which case, this chart doesn't serve the purpose I thought it did.

1102
01:12:49,421 --> 01:12:54,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought these charts were supposed to tell us what games people are playing online head-to-head.

1103
01:12:54,741 --> 01:12:56,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it, but whatever.

1104
01:12:56,782 --> 01:12:57,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep going.

1105
01:12:57,423 --> 01:13:00,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three, Ghost Recon 3, Advanced Warfighter.

1106
01:13:00,464 --> 01:13:01,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Number four, Call of Duty 2.

1107
01:13:03,086 --> 01:13:04,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Number five, Fight Night Round 3.

1108
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Number six, Project Gotham Racing 3.

1109
01:13:08,769 --> 01:13:12,331
[SPEAKER_03]: And number seven, Perfect Dark Zero, which is surprising because the game sucks.

1110
01:13:12,912 --> 01:13:17,554
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people disagree with that statement, just so you know.

1111
01:13:17,654 --> 01:13:20,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like it either, but a lot of people disagree with us.

1112
01:13:20,636 --> 01:13:21,096
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1113
01:13:21,316 --> 01:13:24,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going back to play the games again all the way through.

1114
01:13:24,558 --> 01:13:27,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I will play it, so whatever.

1115
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:28,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I might change my opinion later.

1116
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, though, they should be able to jump.

1117
01:13:33,141 --> 01:13:40,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 8, Battlefield 2 Modern Combat, whether that be the demo or the original Battlefield 2.

1118
01:13:42,145 --> 01:13:44,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 9, Dead or Alive 4, and number 10, Burnout Revenge.

1119
01:13:45,786 --> 01:13:48,387
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I have a hard time believing Burnout Revenge is that far down on the list.

1120
01:13:49,285 --> 01:13:50,866
[SPEAKER_04]: When all those games have Xbox LiveAware.

1121
01:13:50,886 --> 01:13:51,746
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make any sense to me either.

1122
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:57,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Comment from ChatroomsGK128 says, This is probably ranked by how many games are signed on as LiveAware.

1123
01:13:57,209 --> 01:13:57,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, I agree.

1124
01:13:57,689 --> 01:13:59,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the only way this list can be legit.

1125
01:14:00,531 --> 01:14:02,292
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize if I'm pronouncing this name wrong.

1126
01:14:02,532 --> 01:14:08,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Tyrico says that on Oblivion, you have the chat for live so you can get help for quests and stuff.

1127
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:09,595
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess that's true.

1128
01:14:09,675 --> 01:14:13,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the LiveAware element, you can chat with your friends.

1129
01:14:13,897 --> 01:14:16,899
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, you know your buddy Eric and Mel, right?

1130
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:17,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1131
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:21,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Mel just got on Xbox Live, and so I was playing Hexic, or, what is it?

1132
01:14:22,062 --> 01:14:23,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Hexic, I was playing that game earlier.

1133
01:14:23,422 --> 01:14:25,223
[SPEAKER_04]: She was sending me all these messages while I was playing.

1134
01:14:25,603 --> 01:14:26,923
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was sending her voice messages back.

1135
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to friend her.

1136
01:14:27,604 --> 01:14:28,784
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can do the chat things.

1137
01:14:29,084 --> 01:14:32,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to friend them because I don't have them on my list.

1138
01:14:32,305 --> 01:14:34,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you where to get their names and all that good stuff.

1139
01:14:34,606 --> 01:14:38,107
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, you can post your names if you want to maybe be our friend.

1140
01:14:38,147 --> 01:14:39,587
[SPEAKER_04]: We sometimes friend people randomly.

1141
01:14:39,607 --> 01:14:40,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I friend everybody.

1142
01:14:41,368 --> 01:14:42,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll friend long-time listeners of the show.

1143
01:14:43,188 --> 01:14:46,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't friend people that come out of the woodwork, but I friend people who are long-time listeners.

1144
01:14:47,109 --> 01:14:48,670
[SPEAKER_03]: But then if you annoy me, I'll delete you.

1145
01:14:49,639 --> 01:14:51,060
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's on our forums.

1146
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,902
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLaunchRadio.com and there's on the forums.

1147
01:14:53,962 --> 01:15:02,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of which, Jason, he told me, you know, hey, add me.

1148
01:15:02,249 --> 01:15:03,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent him a friend request.

1149
01:15:03,954 --> 01:15:04,274
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura,

1150
01:15:26,252 --> 01:15:30,614
[SPEAKER_04]: We're using it to bring you clips from episodes you may not even be able to get anymore.

1151
01:15:30,914 --> 01:15:38,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And this week, I actually went through and everybody on our friends list, I left comments in my space.

1152
01:15:38,376 --> 01:15:43,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I didn't get everybody because some of your pages are really wacky and I couldn't even figure out how to add a comment.

1153
01:15:43,378 --> 01:15:45,899
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I couldn't figure it out in five seconds, I didn't comment you.

1154
01:15:45,919 --> 01:15:46,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry.

1155
01:15:46,499 --> 01:15:47,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a message and I'll look at it again.

1156
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:50,521
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're leaving comments with people now.

1157
01:15:51,121 --> 01:15:53,362
[SPEAKER_04]: And that took a little while, but it's all good.

1158
01:15:54,184 --> 01:15:58,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to get a comment on your MySpace from Orange Lounge Radio, we'd be happy to do that for you.

1159
01:15:58,366 --> 01:16:00,667
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I'm making Jamie or Loki do it next time.

1160
01:16:02,087 --> 01:16:05,129
[SPEAKER_04]: It's www.myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1161
01:16:05,189 --> 01:16:06,469
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have more pictures of the Humvee.

1162
01:16:07,169 --> 01:16:09,190
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get more picture things because we were doing picture things.

1163
01:16:09,691 --> 01:16:12,992
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get you guys to use your art talents because you have much more than I do, that's for sure.

1164
01:16:13,752 --> 01:16:14,072
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1165
01:16:14,392 --> 01:16:20,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so add us on the MySpace, myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and other cool things to come to the MySpace eventually.

1166
01:16:21,334 --> 01:16:25,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it here for the first part of our podcast.

1167
01:16:25,557 --> 01:16:30,280
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay tuned to the podcast and a little later this week will come part number two.

1168
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:35,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1169
