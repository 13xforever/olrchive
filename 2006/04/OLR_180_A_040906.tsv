14096	26447	Tonight, April 9th, 2006, new screenshots from the revolution hit the internet, Xbox Live prepares for lots of new arcade games, and which Japanese company might be finding itself in big trouble this tax season?
32679	33900	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, Asian Bird Flu,
55780	56660	No, I don't know.
57100	60221	She has a really high fever or something, so she had to call in tonight.
60241	62982	So we hope you feel better soon, DarkSakura, if you're out there listening.
63402	72485	Secretly, though, I think she's just like... You know how when a really popular video game would come out, you'd stay at home, call in sick, and play hooky to play that game?
72765	74325	I think Kingdom Hearts 2 did that to her.
74585	76506	I think she called in sick to stay home and play Kingdom Hearts 2.
77346	78226	No, of course I'm teasing.
78946	80227	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
80247	84268	You know what's funny is I feel like I'm actually Jamie right now because...
85473	88014	I'm sitting in a chair with a laptop.
88954	90535	I know, because you got your new laptop, didn't you?
90595	91896	Yeah, so this is weird.
92296	93556	And you did not buy a Mac.
93976	94717	I did not buy a Mac.
94777	97498	Despite the advice of our listeners.
97978	105761	Honestly, you've got to compare the specs, and then you see clearly that the way to go is the way I did.
105841	106941	Well, I'm not a fan of Gateway.
106981	107562	How does that feel?
108102	109963	I'm not a fan of Gateway either, to be honest.
110143	110803	But you know what?
110883	113444	This computer is at the right price and has the right specs.
114319	116361	To me, Gateway is merely the case it's in.
116561	117822	So, whatever.
119003	125309	Well, helping us out tonight, since we're one person short, we had to call on someone at the last minute and always prepared to lend a hand.
125649	126790	Say hello to Spike.
128311	128652	Hello.
128892	129392	How you doing?
130293	131194	I'm doing very good.
131434	131654	Good.
131855	132295	Good to hear it.
134182	141784	All right, he's feeling a little pressure a little bit because we literally asked him about an hour ago, hey, can you sit in and be a host tonight on a radio program on the internet?
142244	143045	But you've done this before.
143065	143665	You were here before.
143825	144765	It's always good times.
144965	146366	All right, yeah, you know a lot about games.
146406	149326	I know you don't really lead it on very much, but you know a lot about games.
149346	149807	You really do.
150747	154288	What was that Japanese game you're saying you're going to bring me next week that was some PS2 launch title?
154608	156469	Primal Image It's like, you know...
179442	179762	I don't know.
179963	183885	It's the best feature of the game because the game itself is very slow and boring.
184545	186066	But you said it reminded you of this game.
186446	187047	Well, yeah.
187267	192550	It's basically Pokemon Snap with half-naked virtual models.
193391	198794	And they go around doing their various poses as you circle around them taking photos.
199074	203657	And you get bonus points for the sort of more suggestive photos you take.
204657	205138	Very fun.
205498	206919	But they did not release this game in the U.S. ?
208050	208811	And Mischief Makers
235266	236087	No, I never played that.
236107	238410	Oh, you've got Dropjaw.
238430	239251	What is Mischief Makers?
239291	239931	I've never heard of this.
241313	242514	I've heard of Mischief Makers.
242614	243816	It's not as bad as it sounds.
244016	244436	What is it?
244917	245217	Tell me.
246098	246619	What is this game?
246639	247159	What are you doing it?
247940	251504	If I remember correctly, it's based off an anime, I want to say.
251564	252845	No, don't look like that.
253366	254167	It's not like that.
254367	256249	It's a good game.
256549	257450	It's an anime game.
257911	258211	All right.
259591	268993	Alright, we're going to go around and start this show off as we usually do with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week, where we go around and check in and see what we've been playing this week and what we like and what we hate.
269693	270853	Loki, what have you been playing this week?
271353	276294	I've been playing Far Cry Instinct's Predator, and that game's pretty, I don't know, long.
277695	288557	It's a fun game, you know, but then again, it's one of those games, like achievement-wise, if you're going for achievement points in this game, you might as well spend your time elsewhere because to beat the game, you get 10 points.
289437	298679	And you have to beat it in every single difficulty through both the Instinct storyline and the Evolution storyline.
299279	301059	And then do a bunch of other shit.
301339	307201	Where some of those Xbox Live Arcade games are like, You press the L trigger, you get 20 points!
307581	312282	That would be hilarious to have a game with a thousand achievements and each one's a point.
312682	315462	You know, like pushing direction up, pushing direction down.
315942	318563	That would be hilarious, but no, unfortunately...
319042	319843	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
339090	340350	I don't know, so that game's kind of fun.
341171	342591	I did get Rumble Roses XX.
342751	345412	I did not buy Rumble Roses XX, just to make that clear.
345732	347593	I would not spend money on that game, unfortunately.
347833	348993	But I did get it.
349173	355155	I haven't played it, though, yet, because I got a laptop and haven't had a chance to waste time on that game.
355535	358196	But it looked interesting, I guess.
359736	365118	Right now, I've gotten pretty much every game for March, except for...
366537	368898	Blazing Angels, and that's the only one I don't have yet.
369078	373558	But I'm not really going to be buying games until June now, because I don't like Tomb Raider.
374039	375879	I don't really care for Top Spin.
375939	377939	Battlefield 2, never played it, don't really care.
378760	390442	And the stuff in May, you know, X-Men 3, maybe Time Shift, and MotoGP 2006 moved, and Rockstar's Table Tennis, no thank you.
391582	395463	I have to admit, my interest has somewhat peaked at Rockstar Table Tennis, I must say.
395711	398553	I've been playing, of course, more Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City Stories.
399233	400114	It's just fun.
400914	403216	Six months, I mean, now it doesn't get old.
403976	404837	It's just really fun.
404877	409620	The multiplayer is the best part, and I hope the god that has the multiplayer when it comes out on the PlayStation 2 version.
411541	412521	Instincts tell me, though, no.
412962	413482	It's not gonna.
414102	414382	Alright.
415203	415563	Anything else?
416444	416784	That's it.
416984	417264	Alright.
417965	420566	Spike, my friend, what have you been playing this week?
421387	424949	I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XII, XI, oh my god.
426414	428595	You're too eager for the XII, aren't you?
428775	429056	I am.
429136	431037	I want to play it so badly.
432057	439321	Which is a marked change from how I felt initially, but now all my time with XI has me really excited about that same base gameplay, but with a story.
439402	439782	See?
439902	441002	That's what I'm telling people.
441042	445625	To really appreciate the Final Fantasy XII demo, you must have had some exposure to XI.
445925	446546	Yeah, it's true.
446686	447786	I definitely agree with you now.
448307	452689	I'm also replaying Kingdom Hearts, the first game, to get ready for the second one.
453730	453870	And...
455004	457526	Is this because you're poor and you'll have to wait until it's a $20 game?
457946	459608	That's almost exactly why.
460388	461950	I'm just giving you a hard time.
462450	466013	But yeah, I put in 17 hours over that last week.
466113	466613	Dang.
467634	474979	And I forgot how much I hated the camera, but I really like everything else about the game.
475019	478002	That perfectly sums up my review of Kingdom Hearts, the first one.
479003	480384	Hate the camera, love everything else.
480764	480884	Yep.
481365	483006	So yeah, that's my week in gaming.
483346	483666	Awesome.
484287	485727	Let's see what I've been playing this week.
485787	494232	I just picked up Top Spin 2, the tennis game on the Xbox 360, which was the only Xbox 360 game I played at last year's E3.
494292	499135	So I think it has somewhat sentimental value to me because it was the only game that had no lines last year at E3.
499235	504558	No, I actually played it, instead of playing it at the Microsoft booth, I played it at 2K Games' booth.
505038	526018	and there wasn't nearly as many people there because they were kind of in a different spot so I got to play Top Spin 2 and I don't think I've played this game thoroughly enough to give it a good review yet I did notice like my first impressions were character creation whoa like okay it's it's right up there with Oblivion okay you know how Oblivion like will let you totally customize everything
526966	527647	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
544640	546000	What exactly did they do with that?
546100	549361	They did the whole... There was that skit that they did on Saturday Night Live.
549441	550322	Young Chuck Norris.
550582	551902	The whole song that goes along with that.
552382	556583	And he kicked and he punched and... It's really funny.
556623	557244	You gotta check it out.
557284	558324	I think it's on YouTube.
558984	565806	And they really... Just using the normal character creation, they made it really look like Chuck Norris.
566166	568447	And it was hilarious because he was beating up the shop owner.
569167	573008	It went through basically everything that was on the Saturday Night Live music video.
573353	575053	They just kind of recreated Oblivion.
575073	575814	It was pretty funny.
576134	576414	Awesome.
577414	584296	So besides the character creation, then I started doing career mode a little bit, but I found that I kind of sucked at the game because I didn't know what I was doing.
584716	588177	I didn't think the game had a very friendly tutorial mode or anything.
588917	595299	There was really nothing to tell me, press A to do a light bounce, press X to do a slice, and all that stuff.
595619	600921	And I would like a tennis game that's built for the retarded tennis player like myself.
601499	604420	Who is too fat to play real tennis.
606220	609421	Who might be able to benefit from knowing what a slice really is.
609441	611081	Assuming maybe I haven't played tennis before.
611141	612181	Okay, I know what it is.
612281	613241	But you know what I mean?
613341	616142	I would have liked something that really started me from an amateur level.
616442	620163	Whereas the game kind of threw me right in there and expected me to know stuff.
620243	623724	Even in the first training, it's like, okay, I've got to serve 10 balls.
623944	625684	And you're like, okay, what the hell am I doing?
626044	627565	It didn't really explain it for me.
627645	630107	So I actually had to open the instruction manual and read it.
630488	631889	I don't like having to do that with games.
631989	635452	Instruction manuals are dated things.
635512	637473	I don't ever read instruction manuals with games.
637614	637814	Ever.
638254	638774	I don't need them.
639095	639455	Usually.
639555	640796	But I needed it for this.
641096	641997	That made me a little sad.
642698	643859	But the graphics are really pretty.
644039	650764	I played a tournament in a Japanese cup or something and it was all decorated very Japanese style.
650964	652946	Totally stereotypical, but it was cool.
653787	653867	Um...
655302	669893	Besides that, I've been playing holdovers from last week, Beatmania, Kingdom Hearts 2, and I downloaded Feeding Frenzy, which is an Xbox Live Arcade title, which I guess came out a couple weeks ago, because I wanted a new arcade game, and Street Fighter 2 is still not available.
670133	671094	What the hell's with that?
671314	671694	I don't know.
672195	677398	Well, they had major lag problems that they had to fix.
677559	681922	A friend of a friend mentioned that there's major lag issues going on, and that's, I don't think...
682645	684226	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
708343	709504	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
726790	736293	And I think it's because Geometry Wars, and I really suck at Geometry Wars, but it has me skilled enough to dodge things really well using the analog stick, like using my sprite to dodge things.
736953	741294	And that's pretty much all Feeding Frenzy is, is a poor man's Geometry Wars with no shooter.
742575	746896	No, it's just, here's the thing I don't like about some of these Xbox Live Arcade games.
746916	747836	How about no trackball?
747896	750697	Because that game is way better with a trackball than it is a controller.
751657	753438	I didn't mind the controller, because I'm...
753891	754612	The game's okay.
754692	758317	I do like the fact that it saves your progress, because the game is kind of crappy.
758337	760681	I wouldn't want to have to go back and replay the whole game.
762604	768612	The thing, though, I don't like about it is that all these web games are getting ported over.
768632	769954	They're just Flash games.
770315	770455	Yep.
770871	775913	And let me take a moment to introduce the chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.
776533	780574	We do tape live every Sunday night to provide listener interaction.
780614	782575	We're one of the few podcasts that allow this.
782655	783155	It's awesome.
783175	783795	We love doing this.
784896	786016	And you guys get your input.
786076	792938	GK128 says in the chat room, Feeding Frenzy, free on the PC, $10 on Xbox Live Arcade.
793479	793939	And you know what?
793959	794799	You're absolutely right.
794939	795859	I'm a consumer whore.
795899	799881	There's absolutely no reason I should have paid for this except for...
800561	813225	The fact that as opposed to sitting in my little office chair and playing on the PC little screen, I like being able to plop my butt on the couch, you know, have my cup of tea or whatever I'm drinking that night, and play on the HDTV.
813886	815046	There's something to be said about that.
815126	820708	I mean, that's why I plan to get Final Fantasy XI in a couple weeks, which makes absolutely no sense because I already have it on the PC.
820808	828311	But I'm just that lazy where I want to plop on the couch and not have to move or anything and lay down and, you know, all that stuff.
828731	828871	Just...
829136	832359	Make sure you buy a USB mouse and keyboard.
833279	833580	Duh.
834300	838784	Well, X defers upgrading, so I think I'm going to steal that one and use it as the Xbox thingy.
839344	841346	Okay, I'm just saying, though, make sure.
841366	853176	Yeah, no, there's no way in hell I would play, and I would advise anybody out there that's going to get into Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360, do yourself a favor, buy a USB keyboard and a USB mouse, because you will be a sad, sad person otherwise.
853696	855878	Actually, you might be able to fake it without the mouse.
856573	858314	You could probably do it without the keyboard.
858454	868137	The mouse, yeah, the mouse, because I remember I didn't really use the mouse at all during the game, so the keyboard's fine, especially with all the shortcuts and everything, so that's not a problem.
868177	873219	And honestly, I already have a USB mouse that I use on my laptop, and it's wireless, so why not just take it and use it on the 360?
873299	879242	And the keyboard's good anyways because you can actually use it in other games, like, for example, putting in cheat codes in Far Cry and Sinks.
879602	881082	It makes it a lot easier with a keyboard.
881102	882443	There you go, there you go.
883410	888939	VXJasonXV says Street Fighter 2 is now on GameTap Magic Sword is now on GameTap Hello, like one of my favorite Capcom games ever
898331	898911	Any word on Black Tiger?
915012	919713	No, but VXJasonXV stays on top of that stuff more than I do, so he will probably be able to stay.
919953	921833	He did tell me King's Quest is on the way, though.
922074	928395	He saw in some movie thing on GameTap TV that King's Quest is coming, to which I said something about, oh, it's about time.
929955	931635	Let's see, other questions.
931935	939997	I noticed our chat room is playing Mario Kart DS tonight, so if you're trying to find friends for DS and you're listening live, go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com and click on chat.
940922	943965	and you can find some folks to play Mario Kart DS with.
944446	947830	I do see a lot of agreements for Mischief Makers.
947870	951033	HitStun in our chatroom says, Mischief Makers fucking owns.
951674	952134	And I quote.
952915	954417	So somebody knew what you were talking about.
954847	955768	Spirit Snare agrees.
955808	957169	Mischief Makers was indeed awesome.
957289	959170	That's because you guys have the best listeners.
959390	959711	We do.
959791	960591	We seriously do.
960932	961712	I love our listeners.
961732	962313	They're so awesome.
962333	963493	We've got a full chat room tonight.
964194	968297	I demanded last week that more people visit our MySpace and it worked.
968897	972900	We've like doubled our numbers on MySpace and people are actually leaving us comments now.
972960	973601	It's awesome.
973701	974642	I love you guys for doing that.
974962	977884	If you want to visit MySpace.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
978144	978645	All one word.
980046	983008	Hurry before they take MySpace down because of all the, you know...
985336	986977	The Nintendo DS is the new stalker system.
987017	991498	Your little girl might go on PictoChat and get raped.
991558	992259	I mean, seriously.
992279	992759	The hell was that?
1009890	1011251	That news is like two months old.
1011312	1021040	I would love to do that, just like, you know, do a little skit or something, like doing PictoChat and says, I'm going to rape you, and then have like a picture to go with it.
1021180	1022021	OLR TV.
1022161	1023983	Just save these ideas for OLR TV.
1024303	1024644	Okay.
1026005	1027126	Before you know who steals it.
1027918	1028598	Yeah.
1028858	1034861	But wait, I was going to say, the videos, speaking of which, you updated OLRPSP.com with videos, right?
1034901	1035562	Yeah, that was fun.
1035702	1047448	Including something that we purposefully cut out of last week's show because it didn't make the podcast because I had the giggles a little too much going into one segment, but DarkSakura had a lot to do with that.
1047708	1050989	But you taped the whole thing and put a video of it on OLRPSP.com.
1051009	1051910	Yeah, it was fun.
1052210	1053771	So more videos to come in the future.
1053831	1055352	Yeah, more videos to come in the future.
1057179	1066024	We can't say too much yet, but... Yeah, and I'm trying to... Well, the whole video thing was kind of an experiment because the PSP itself doesn't like downloading the videos.
1066064	1067085	It thinks it's a web page.
1068165	1071347	It's kind of retarded when you think of it because you have to save the link as.
1071847	1075989	So I've got to put some different instructions on there and work at it that way.
1076450	1078651	Well, we're learning now because we've got something big planned.
1078791	1078971	Yeah.
1079171	1079972	That's all I have to say.
1080012	1082253	We've got something big planned for like a month.
1082413	1083734	It's going to be huge.
1084094	1084314	Yeah.
1084374	1084594	Huge.
1085715	1085955	All right.
1086658	1093203	Let's get into some news, and we'll start it off tonight with Loki, and I got some news over there on the Revolution.
1093764	1102391	Oh yeah, they've actually had some screenshots of Red Steel, one of the games that's coming to the Revolution, leaked to the internet.
1102411	1108496	They're actually out of the new issue of Game Informer, the May issue, and you know what?
1109637	1115722	I'm starting to think here that the Revolution might be as powerful as some of these other systems out there.
1116345	1116885	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1145086	1147387	You can do that too, which is really neat.
1147667	1149427	And use it also as a sword in the game.
1150368	1160971	But by the screenshot so far, I would say this looks pretty on par with even stuff like Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter, and even Rainbow Six Vegas.
1161031	1162952	It looks really good.
1163432	1168754	I'm really shocked, especially since they're saying that the specs aren't that great and stuff.
1169355	1170296	I think it looks really good.
1170396	1172398	This is a great comment from our chatroom right here.
1172578	1175801	Ota G says, Specs don't make a game look good.
1176021	1177863	Developers make games look good.
1178043	1188213	Exactly, and here's the thing too, and a lot of people, when they're looking at these, they're saying, well, you know what, just because the specs aren't as powerful, because they're not going HD, they can use that extra, you know,
1188893	1191034	and processing power to make it look even better.
1191274	1196417	Yeah, but Nintendo, can't you do a little HD?
1196597	1197838	Well, they're doing something.
1197858	1200559	They're doing 480p, so that's something.
1200579	1201300	Does that mean widescreen?
1201600	1202581	That's progressive scan.
1203201	1204181	I know what means progressive scan.
1204201	1205382	Does it mean I get widescreen too?
1205422	1206142	I think so, yeah.
1206162	1206423	Hooray!
1206923	1208384	So it's something.
1209044	1209724	And you know what?
1210265	1210605	I don't know.
1210665	1213026	They can change that later maybe.
1213126	1213486	I don't know.
1214207	1214347	But...
1215928	1217169	I don't know, it just looks really good.
1217770	1218230	Really good.
1219272	1219632	Alright.
1220152	1222475	Now, Spike, I saw these pictures in your live journal.
1222495	1223996	What do you think of Red Steel?
1224705	1225585	I'm really impressed.
1225865	1230067	I, as many others, I was really excited about the revolution for the gameplay innovation.
1230607	1236648	I had my hopes set on maybe we'd see games eventually that looked like Resident Evil 4.
1237549	1241530	I'm already like, wow, this is past that, and I'm really impressed.
1241570	1242290	I'm really happy.
1242630	1253253	The only issue I have with this, in looking at the pictures, I mean, the game looks pretty hot, don't get me wrong, and I'm really glad to see that Nintendo, you know, even if this is leaked out, I'm glad to see we're finally seeing something on the revolution.
1253693	1259999	My only hesitation is that I think a gun game using that controller is like the most cliche thing you could possibly do.
1260579	1261760	Although I agree with you.
1262060	1264202	It is a game being produced by Ubisoft.
1264823	1267725	Which, first off, you know, that's kind of expected, I'd think, from them.
1268225	1274311	But that says to me an even deeper message about developers are taking this very seriously.
1274371	1278714	They're not just, you know, making $10 shovelware ports for the revolution.
1278734	1280696	They're actually coming up with ideas and...
1281366	1289375	VXChaseNextV in chat says, Cliche, but it makes sense.
1290317	1290777	I suppose.
1290977	1297204	I mean, I just hope that... I want to see more like the demo with the chopping the vegetables thing.
1297244	1298626	Now, that was unique.
1298766	1300809	Are you looking forward to the next Nintendogs?
1302607	1307355	If it's like the DS one, I really hope they expand on it big time.
1307436	1308858	They announced 50 launch titles.
1309439	1310020	For real?
1310661	1313927	50 launch titles, 20 of which are going to be put out by Nintendo.
1315379	1316280	Where did you get this?
1316440	1317140	I haven't heard of this.
1318281	1319462	I don't remember where I read that.
1319903	1323245	Well, then I have to take it with a grain of salt if you cannot cite a fact.
1323265	1324206	That's what they're saying, though.
1324927	1327229	But if that's the case, though, you will see these innovative things.
1327289	1338578	But still, though, the thing about the revolution is, and they're trying to get away from the Nintendo being looked at as a kid system, a system that's meant for little kids, and that's it.
1339078	1343842	And that's what Microsoft and Sony want you to believe, is that the system is meant for
1345345	1351210	Well, something tells me this little game with the gun thing is going to dispel that pretty quick.
1351310	1355534	Well, I don't know, but it just looks good.
1355634	1357956	That's all I've got to say.
1358036	1367684	A Nintendo fanboy's answer to whenever a Microsoft or Sony fanboy presents them with that is Resident Evil 4, which usually is a GameCube fanboy's answer to everything.
1367904	1370226	When somebody tries to doggone... Resident Evil 4, bitch.
1370666	1371127	Resident Evil 4.
1372091	1373211	Resident Evil 4, bitch.
1373411	1374032	That's great.
1374532	1376072	I've said that exactly, actually.
1376132	1376692	Have you really?
1376933	1377353	I have.
1378133	1379974	I think everybody should use that in a sentence today.
1380254	1383115	Challenge yourself to tell a friend, Resident Evil 4, bitch.
1385095	1385915	Snakes on a plane.
1387416	1387696	Shut up.
1389318	1390219	Snake's on a Resident Evil 4...
1419388	1423611	Brain Age, Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day, which I'm really looking forward to trying out.
1423751	1427894	Even if it does have Sudoku in it, which I'm a little tired of, I think the rest of it will be pretty cool.
1428114	1429254	So I'm really looking forward to that.
1429294	1430315	So I want to try this demo.
1431096	1433097	And True Swing Golf is also another demo in there.
1433397	1439141	Now, I did a quick search in our area, and it looks like GameCrazy is the chain that's going to be carrying this a lot.
1439161	1441362	GameCrazy is the one that's in Hollywood Video, right?
1442493	1443734	Some Hollywood videos.
1443774	1445754	Some Hollywood videos have them, but not all.
1445814	1449375	But the one nearest me has one, and they have a download station, supposedly.
1449995	1452296	Best Buys are also going to be a huge chain that has them.
1452616	1454296	But again, that's just in my area.
1454356	1455837	Who knows where they are near you?
1456177	1461518	Head on over to Nintendo.com slash DSDownloadStation, all one word, to locate...
1462099	1482554	A DS download station near you And all you gotta do, you go into download play And they'll all come up right on there And you choose what you want to download And here's my tip, I learned this at E3 When they did something similar All you have to do, close your DS, put it in sleep mode You can take the DS home with you as long as you don't turn it off Demo's still there I did that with the Polarium demo last year for E3 Jesus, why?
1482594	1491581	That game was awful Sorry I liked it enough to buy it after the demo The only game I think I hated more than that Was Sprung
1492199	1493820	Otherwise, I thought Polarium was a waste of my time.
1495001	1496703	Now, now, what about Ping Pals?
1497203	1499865	Oh, that's not even a game.
1499925	1501707	That just burns in hell.
1501727	1502447	I gotta love that.
1502467	1505690	You gotta wonder if they were developing that game before.
1505710	1506330	I think so.
1506451	1508512	I think that was before PictoChat was announced.
1508572	1512335	And then when PictoChat was announced to be included, they were like, ah, fuck.
1516519	1518000	So that's why it's a bargain bin title now.
1518877	1520337	Seriously, you could probably find that game for like $5.
1521238	1522258	It's not even worth that.
1522578	1522938	Maybe $0.99.
1523958	1530599	Like, if you can find that game at $0.99 clearance center or the $0.98 store or whatever, then maybe it might be worth a look.
1530619	1532880	But otherwise, that game is of the suck.
1532900	1534240	It's a Dollar Tree special.
1534920	1538161	Speaking of the DS, when do the pretty new ones come out, Loki?
1538661	1539361	Hopefully soon.
1539821	1547663	And the estimated date is going to be around the same time that, you know, Mario, or the new Super Mario Brothers is coming out.
1548427	1552912	Anyways, according to the latest issue of EGM, they're reporting May.
1553032	1554934	And I think we reported May a while back too.
1554954	1558958	I don't remember what the source was from, but it looks like it's going to be May.
1559138	1561140	I mean, it makes sense.
1561421	1565945	It's right when this brand new game comes in and it would be a really good pack-in game.
1566907	1570130	So yeah, I think that's when it's going to happen, sometime mid-May.
1570150	1570230	Okay.
1571343	1572863	Didn't we kind of talk about that last week?
1572943	1579745	Like, theories were around on the internet saying that it's possible that the DS Lite... Well, first Mario Bros.
1579785	1582305	was pushed back, but then I read that that was actually wrong.
1582365	1583005	It got pushed back up.
1583025	1583646	It was a week.
1583846	1586026	They were kind of like... They've been volleying back and forth.
1586066	1586346	Yeah.
1586446	1587346	Like a game of Top Spin.
1588326	1588847	With the dates.
1589387	1590867	But now it's back to the 15th.
1591047	1591787	It's back to the 15th.
1591807	1594228	So we totally reported a false story last week.
1594288	1594608	Our bad.
1595648	1600229	But it's back now, and maybe for the DS Lite to come out at the same time.
1600269	1600409	Yeah.
1601010	1602031	They would have to announce that pretty soon.
1602051	1604633	That would have to be a big surprise thing at E3.
1605074	1608176	The DS Lite is coming out, and it's on store shelves right now.
1609397	1609958	Is that feasible?
1609998	1610438	They could do that?
1610478	1612120	Pull a Sega Saturn?
1612700	1613240	They could.
1615402	1615923	I'm trying to think.
1616403	1619085	Yeah, that would actually be the Monday-Tuesday after E3.
1619105	1621447	Yeah, that makes sense.
1621668	1621988	There you go.
1625086	1628649	Moving on, I've got a story for you guys in regards to Mario as well.
1629650	1634274	There's new postage stamps coming out in Japan that feature the Mario Bros.
1634315	1634715	sprites.
1635331	1639452	And it's 80 yen to get a 10 stamp sheet.
1639472	1639752	I'm sorry.
1639992	1642273	No, it's 80 yen is the value of the stamps.
1642553	1646014	And there's 10 of them, so it would be 800 yen to get one of these sheets.
1646535	1654877	And they're stamps, and they have things like the Cheep Cheeps, Mario, a Koopa, and then that horrible, horrible sprite of the princess.
1655977	1659298	It always looked to me like the princess had a buck tooth in that sprite.
1659338	1660979	I don't know if it's just me, but that's always the way I saw it.
1660999	1664060	It looked like she had funky teeth, like she was Princess White Trash.
1664120	1664400	I don't know.
1665878	1667178	Check that out if you're in Japan.
1667239	1672782	Or if you're not in Japan, check out eBay because I'm sure a lot of these are going to show up for collectors that want to get this stuff.
1673623	1674483	Super Mario Bros.
1674804	1675264	stamps.
1676765	1682048	Also in Revolution news, Zookeeper is going to be coming out for the Revolution.
1682068	1682529	Why?
1682729	1686331	This was from an interview in Nintendo Power, I believe is where this is from.
1688052	1688152	XBOX 360
1718107	1723449	I cannot fathom that they would release this game as a $39, $49 title.
1723809	1729072	And without some really freaking incredible bells and whistles, this game is not worth it.
1729392	1734854	Like, I'd rather see, you know, I'd rather see real animals falling down, not these, like, you know, tiles.
1735274	1737575	As a DS launch title, it was okay.
1737895	1741517	But for a Revolution title... It wasn't even a launch title, and it wasn't a very good title.
1741557	1742377	It's gonna be poopy.
1742817	1744538	However, this is what this makes me think.
1745419	1748321	Nintendo Revolution is going to have a service very similar to Xbox Live Arcade.
1748942	1749482	Yeah, of course.
1749702	1751704	Everybody's going to have a service just like that.
1751784	1758209	Well, I think this kind of just confirms that, and I bet you these old classic titles are probably fitting into that same scheme.
1758509	1764954	So not only are you going to be able to download classic titles, but probably these other games as well, all on the Revolution.
1765094	1771038	I couldn't cite you a specific source, but I'm pretty sure Iwata said something like that at a Game Developers Conference.
1771098	1771699	Oh, probably.
1772599	1773620	Yeah, he said something about like,
1774008	1779011	They're going to make titles that are going to be distributed via the virtual conference.
1779112	1782894	Oh, and I thought I dreamt up this little theory all by myself.
1782954	1783535	Oh, well.
1783975	1784235	Oh, well.
1784635	1785296	Rain on my parade.
1785316	1785776	See if I care.
1786757	1791240	Well, anyway, Zookeeper's coming to both those systems, and we do not care here at Orange Launch Radio.
1792321	1794642	Loki, I'm so glad we gave you this story tonight.
1796303	1799005	There's something going on in the Apple world, right?
1799245	1799986	Yeah, that's right.
1800766	1801447	Well, you know what?
1802193	1811815	Gaming, it's not really been a strong thing on the Apple and now with the Intel chips and the Intel Macs out there.
1813415	1820216	Basically, Apple, their response to gaming on the Mac is use Windows.
1820876	1823837	That's right, because the Mac is useless, so you have to use Windows.
1824237	1831598	Anyway, so you can use this program called Boot Camp that will let you install Windows XP without moving your Mac data.
1832438	1836219	and basically what it'll do is basically a dual boot in the beginning.
1836579	1840720	And you can run Windows XP and it'll run a lot of stuff on there, that's for sure.
1841260	1849622	A lot of games, I can't remember whether it's basically saying, but just a lot of the major games out there right now.
1849822	1854623	So definitely worth checking out if you want to play some games on a Mac.
1856243	1856583	You know what?
1856603	1858384	You can already play World of Warcraft on a Mac.
1858944	1860265	Which is usually... Hey, real games.
1860285	1861385	But not Final Fantasy.
1861565	1862346	No, you can't, no.
1862746	1864026	So, here's the thing.
1864106	1867388	Okay, first off, Macs do to do something.
1867968	1874751	On my iBook, I have made CDs and DVDs faster and prettier than I have on the PC and all that other stuff.
1874771	1877132	How do you make a CD prettier?
1877332	1882654	Just with all the pretty stuff that Apple makes for it to pretty-fy your CDs.
1882874	1883315	I've done it.
1883855	1884095	Like...
1885253	1886875	Pretty Sound... I don't know.
1886935	1888236	I'm thinking more DVDs, okay?
1888276	1891279	Like pretty menus and pretty things that I just could not do on the PC.
1891759	1893521	They were just too weird for me.
1893741	1896003	You couldn't do or PC couldn't do.
1897164	1897885	Look, shut up.
1897985	1898625	It doesn't matter.
1898986	1900567	My point is, I love my Mac.
1900587	1901047	Hey, listen.
1901148	1902329	Don't get mad at me.
1902569	1903930	Get mad at freaking Apple.
1903950	1905752	They're the ones saying use Windows, so...
1907467	1908428	That's not stupid.
1908448	1909128	That's smart.
1909608	1913750	Because now people are going to go, you mean I could do both on one system?
1913850	1914530	That's smart.
1914930	1915190	Good.
1915250	1921353	If you want to get a computer that's pretty, then that way you can run Windows and do stuff on Windows.
1921773	1924274	How is that not the perfect solution?
1925254	1927035	It's pretty and it does everything you need to do.
1928275	1930196	You know, that's just like,
1931547	1932968	That's just stupid, okay.
1933548	1934328	But whatever, okay.
1934709	1946995	If you're really confident that Mac OS X or whatever is great for, you know, doing your video and audio or whatever, and to be honest, it's only better for print media, okay, then great.
1947255	1951137	Use your Mac OS X for that and then use Windows for everything else.
1951758	1956700	Meanwhile, I'll use Windows for everything because, well, it can do everything that Mac OS X can.
1956760	1958401	So, there.
1959662	1960062	You're a jerk.
1961949	1965692	Let's move on to another story and this is interesting.
1965752	1967834	We always love gaming and politics stories.
1968355	1975320	There is a conservative political website out there that was actually defending gaming this week which I thought was very interesting.
1975380	1980265	It's nationalreview.com is the name of the site and they make some very interesting bullet points here.
1980965	1981606	He kind of
1982046	1986907	Adam Therer Of all the games that were reviewed by the ESRB in 2005, less than 13% were rated mature or adults only.
1986987	1988628	Over 80% were either E or T.
2002052	2008156	Every important social indicator has been improving in recent years even as video game use among youths have increased.
2008737	2013860	Aggregate violent crime by juveniles fell 43% between 1995 and 2004.
2014761	2020505	A quick glance at the back of any game box provides parents with plenty of information to make decisions for their families.
2020845	2028770	with most new video games costing between $40 and $60, it's likely that adults will need to be present when their kids purchase games.
2029050	2043819	So, kind of interesting there, coming from a conservative blog, which, I don't know, kind of is trying to set the stage that makes it look like liberals are for these gaming restrictions and conservatives are against them, but I don't really believe that because I've
2044605	2050227	Traditionally vote usually liberal, not 100% of the time, but usually liberal, and I certainly don't support it.
2050447	2073076	I think it's a lack of education on most politicians, and let's not forget, in order for these laws to pass most of the time in the states and everything, it's got to have bipartisan support, because usually you don't pass with just one side of the house, but that's just my... You've got to wonder how many of these actual lawmakers out there are just bored out of their mind, and they just want to go home, so they're going to agree to whatever you put in front of them.
2073356	2073716	No idea.
2074997	2077899	But yeah, it's kind of... It's like, another one of these bills?
2078519	2079179	Fine!
2079580	2080240	Just do it.
2080280	2081080	I want to go home.
2081721	2082441	And screw a hooker.
2085383	2086463	That's what politicians do.
2087384	2095268	Yeah, speaking of M-rated games in which you might be screwing hookers, Loki, there's some interesting statistics out there this week on M-rated games?
2095388	2098230	Yes, because Harvard, you know, because they have nothing better to do than...
2098680	2099480	Thank you for watching!
2116055	2125457	Basically, the report's conclusion was parents and physicians should recognize that the popular M-rated video games contain a wide range of unlabeled content.
2125557	2137259	No, actually, I think most of the content is labeled on the back there in that little label that says M and may expose children and adolescents to messages that may negatively influence their perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors.
2139039	2139199	No.
2139699	2143060	I think that it clearly says, you know, rated M for violence.
2143100	2144240	It doesn't say rated M for
2145017	2148228	104 violent deaths per minute or hour or whatever.
2151699	2154821	Why are they wasting our money on doing studies like this?
2155181	2158484	Seriously, I could look at a game and go, hmm, that's pretty violent.
2158524	2164488	When the game's called I'm Gonna Kill Your Fucking Mother, you probably can guess, hmm, it's pretty violent.
2164508	2170473	Instead of Happy Puppy Fun Time is not going to have freaking violent deaths in it.
2171093	2173035	Seriously, what's the big deal?
2173075	2174656	Why are they doing studies on this?
2175076	2178859	R-rated movies are bad, okay, because they have R-rated content.
2179229	2182291	Well, M-rated games are going to have bad content in them as well.
2182392	2184413	So it makes perfect sense.
2184433	2185654	Well, my thought is only 104?
2186555	2187596	That's child's play.
2187636	2188516	That's a low score.
2189097	2190798	Haven't you ever played Smash TV?
2191139	2195582	Do you know how many violent deaths occur in the scope of like two minutes when I'm playing Smash TV?
2197724	2200706	Like you tear through just people among people.
2200726	2204069	Have you seen games like Dynasty Warriors and 99 Nights and stuff like that?
2204149	2207912	I mean, seriously, you're killing thousands of people in like minutes.
2208317	2210358	I would like to know what games were sampled.
2210518	2213338	I mean, I don't know, and I don't really care.
2213718	2226261	All I know is... And did they, like, were you playing a game like, I don't know, like, I hate to use this as an example, but Driver 3, where, like, when I play, I aim for the people, and that's how I play Driver 3, is I purposely try to run over as many people as I can.
2226281	2230582	Shouldn't you be, like, trying to find a cure for cancer or something, other than doing, you know, stupid research like this?
2231022	2232223	I mean, what's this actually prove?
2232343	2233803	Wow, we knew what we already knew.
2234843	2235163	Great.
2235464	2237024	Give me my A. You know, seriously.
2238666	2238946	I don't know.
2239647	2240127	That's great.
2241287	2244769	I'm going over to the chat room, www.orangelongeradio.com.
2244789	2245310	Click on chat.
2245330	2246370	I think this is very funny.
2246951	2253914	Dark Tetsuya was responding to the whole like all the information is on the back of the box thing from the conservative blog.
2253934	2257396	And he says, yeah, but parents would actually have to check the back of the box.
2258437	2258857	Oh, that's right.
2259137	2260938	All the effort to rotate the box.
2262299	2263460	Why was I even thinking that?
2263500	2266001	Because parents don't have that kind of energy.
2266844	2269528	Let alone to watch kids and monitor what they do.
2270248	2270969	This is what I think is great.
2270989	2273733	Can I tell a story about my childhood and my mother from my childhood?
2274053	2275114	Okay, here we go.
2275695	2282984	When I was a kid, my mom would spend literally an hour at the video store reading the back of every single box of every movie that's new that week.
2283264	2283685	She's in the store.
2283705	2283945	She's going,
2284414	2285875	Do I want to rant this one?
2286695	2287415	Or do I want to rant that?
2287455	2288776	Oh, this one sounds violent.
2288796	2289837	I don't know if I want to get that one.
2290137	2293358	Oh, this might be, you know, she'll spend like an hour reading the back of every box.
2293898	2296380	And then like I'll, you know, take a game that I want to rant.
2296440	2298481	I'll walk up to her and I'll be all, can I rant this?
2298901	2300101	And she'll ask me, what's it about?
2300121	2302763	It's about fun.
2304143	2305064	Happy puppies.
2306605	2308846	I mean, can I rant Mortal Kombat 2?
2309106	2309706	What's it about?
2311147	2312907	People playing together.
2313428	2313728	Okay.
2314870	2324940	I mean seriously, yet in the same scope, I mean I love my mom, in the same scope she would spend like an hour reading the back of all the movie boxes and you know, she'd have to ask me what the game's about.
2324960	2332567	You know I was thinking like games like Smash TV, how many people do you think you kill in that game, you know, in an average minute?
2333268	2333668	Probably about 104.
2335628	2336669	I'd go more like 300.
2337309	2339610	Are you playing two-player or one-player?
2339931	2340611	Yeah, it depends.
2341471	2346414	And somebody in the chatroom, Dark Knight, mentioned the sequel, Total Carnage, which is probably twice as bad.
2346614	2348875	Exactly, and here's another thing, too.
2349155	2357560	If you're counting violent deaths, say I'm playing a Star Wars game or something like that, and I destroy the Death Star or something.
2357740	2359901	How many millions of people are in the Death Star?
2359941	2363343	I mean, that's really going to throw the statistic out.
2365043	2367164	Out there, so I don't know.
2367884	2370245	Does the AT-ST count for 30 deaths?
2370685	2371886	I think that's a good question.
2372266	2373406	And it should if it doesn't.
2373606	2375107	Oh, I'm so glad to know I'm not alone.
2375187	2379148	Fireboma in our chatroom says that's the exact same thing my parents did, Sky.
2379669	2381769	So I'm not alone in the world.
2382430	2382810	Good to know.
2385611	2386131	Moving on.
2387779	2389780	Just a friendly warning to folks out there.
2389820	2390640	There was a story.
2390720	2391561	Another study.
2392481	2395862	This was according to Reuters actually ran this study here.
2396523	2398604	I don't know if they conducted the study, but they actually ran it.
2398884	2404046	But they just want you to know, mature rated video games may contain mature content.
2405140	2406021	Did you?
2406561	2407282	No, here's the deal.
2407362	2408723	Pornos may contain sex.
2408743	2409464	No, here's the deal.
2409964	2419172	The study shows that a big black M on the front of the game may not be enough to show that there's violence, nudity, or whatever else is in the game.
2419512	2424216	Because it doesn't go into as much details as you might have thought.
2424896	2426738	Kimberly Thompson was the study's author.
2428019	2432823	She's concerned that parents might take this as a sign that the game is just peachy for kids, saying that
2433323	2439106	Parents should not interpret the absence of a content descriptor to mean the absence of content.
2439707	2448972	The study found that 80% of M-rated games included sex, violence, profanity, gambling, or drug and alcohol use, none of which was described on the labels.
2449312	2450713	This was ran by Reuters.
2451033	2452374	You know, Super Mario Bros.
2452394	2459038	3 contains gambling as well because you can get your power-ups, you have to match them, and that's like a slot machine.
2459518	2461219	Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?
2461840	2462060	I don't...
2464048	2465829	I mean, come on, why wasn't that rated M?
2466669	2468770	You know, here's another thing, too, I was wondering.
2469010	2474093	Maybe we should change our ranking system to NP for mature-rated games, not Peachy for kids.
2474373	2475073	I like that better.
2476167	2477428	Seriously, what do we need to have?
2477488	2482010	Like a person's decapitated head, you know, that says, this may contain violence.
2482030	2483230	Well, I didn't know!
2483490	2487012	I couldn't tell that the decapitated head meant violence.
2487312	2487772	I didn't know.
2487792	2490334	Maybe that's what we need to do is start putting little pictures on the thing.
2490374	2493855	Like, you know, a little decapitated head may contain violence.
2494235	2496797	A pair of titties may contain nudity.
2497297	2500838	Like, just write fuck on the box, you know, might contain profanity.
2500858	2501839	That one's...
2502399	2506281	Can you imagine what the cover of Grand Theft Auto would look like?
2508081	2508942	You know what I'm gonna say.
2508962	2513044	No, seriously, though, this is why we have to put on, like, you know, spray paint bottles.
2513084	2513764	Do not eat.
2513984	2519946	I mean, just because people out there are that fucking retarded that they can't figure this stuff out.
2519986	2526749	Seriously, if you're that dumb, you know, that you can't understand what the words mean, maybe you shouldn't be playing games.
2526809	2528370	Maybe you should learn how to read instead.
2530421	2533243	Fireboma would like to point out Kingdom Hearts 2 has blood in it.
2533323	2535204	Maybe it should be rated M for Slash.
2536285	2541068	Dark Knight is suggesting some other family-friendly games that parents could buy here.
2541368	2542889	Mary-Kate and Ashley get a clue.
2543730	2546091	That might be a good one for parents to play.
2546652	2547332	That'd be really good.
2547992	2550074	And then, of course, now they're talking about Super Mario Bros.
2550114	2556878	hacks, because somebody said Super Titty Bros., which I guess was really a hack that was out there, and now they're talking about all the other hacks.
2556978	2557779	Super Porno Bros.
2557799	2558479	Cracks out there.
2559100	2559380	Lame.
2560458	2562319	Everybody and their mother did a Super Mario Bros.
2562359	2562599	hack.
2563740	2568223	Speaking of hacks, we have a story on our old buddy Jackie Poo, right, Loki?
2568383	2569304	Yes, Jackie Poo.
2569924	2573466	And his modest proposal, part two.
2574147	2580591	Basically, he, I don't know what he has against Joystick and why he's reading so much of this website.
2580891	2581912	Because they'll report on him.
2582552	2583853	I guess, you know.
2584383	2590605	But anyways, he says, hey, how about a video game depicting killing of people who run Joystick?
2591105	2596647	I bet they'd be real interested in doing something about a certain game then.
2597148	2601069	Maybe they would feel how cops and women feel about Grand Theft Auto.
2601649	2604170	Oh, but that would require some actual thought.
2604210	2605871	And I forgot, you're all gamers.
2606311	2609572	So Joystick is running a contest now to design a game.
2609592	2609672	Yeah.
2610265	2630955	and stuff and it's to be honest it's real stupid and yes joystick I love that response joystick's response is to run a contest encouraging the deaths of joystick uh bloggers horrifically and the best one will win a prize or whatever it is I mean that's great I don't understand what this guy's problem is I mean seriously why is he going out to gaming blogs I mean that's like
2632602	2634424	Because thousands of people read joystick.
2634564	2637146	I read joystick, you read joystick, Spike, you read joystick.
2637286	2637666	Damn right.
2637686	2638907	That's three out of three right there.
2638927	2641770	100% of gamers read joystick.
2641790	2643431	100% of us don't care what he says either.
2643691	2643972	I know.
2643992	2648896	I mean, doesn't he understand that that's... See, did you like how I ran that study?
2648976	2649956	That's what other people do.
2650097	2652779	I said 100% of gamers read joystick because we all do.
2652899	2653159	So that's 100%.
2655501	2658163	You know... Send it to Harvard.
2658183	2659804	That should be our new tagline.
2660165	2661646	100% of gamers listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
2662824	2663364	Wouldn't that be great?
2664985	2674371	You know, I'm sorry, but Jackie Poo needs to seriously, he needs to do something.
2674451	2675332	He needs to get a hobby.
2676052	2682436	And because this whole, you know, holy crusade that he's going on is just ridiculous.
2684197	2688080	I mean, he's like the freaking Batman of the legal world.
2688120	2688600	I mean, he's,
2689076	2697139	He will not stop until he gets revenge with the people who killed people because they played Grand Theft Auto or something.
2697760	2701041	RavensDolphin in chat says, Orange Lounge Radio is next for Jack.
2701121	2701581	Look out.
2701941	2702421	You know what?
2702742	2704602	Hey, here it is, right there on the table.
2705003	2715907	If Jackie Poo wants to come on this show and have a professional interview, as long as he's prepared to answer the difficult questions, because we don't BS around, I will treat him with respect and dignity forever.
2716423	2717123	Thank you for watching!
2731721	2732941	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2755472	2758994	Conduct yourself like a lawyer and not like a little kid.
2785926	2786827	Jack's latest tirades and such.
2786847	2788928	Well, they are wiping their ass with his name.
2789168	2789428	Literally.
2789448	2789869	That's mature.
2813875	2821301	Yes, in fact, if you want to buy some Jack Thompson toilet paper, they have it available on Jinx.com.
2821721	2823823	It's only $5.95 for a roll.
2824604	2826745	The question is, is it two-player or one-player?
2827126	2828927	That's a lot for a roll of toilet paper.
2828947	2834011	$5.95 at Target will get you like a 12-pack, at least, of toilet paper.
2835312	2838795	That's not a lot of ass to wipe there with the Jack Thompson toilet paper for $5.95.
2839075	2842798	But every time you use the bathroom, you'd come out smiling.
2844417	2845197	That's worth something.
2845217	2846257	Maybe I already do that.
2846277	2846657	You know what?
2846697	2849658	In case if that's not enough, they also have RIAA toilet paper, too.
2849698	2850098	Oh, goody.
2851178	2852899	Do I get a discount if I order them both?
2854839	2855179	I don't know.
2857259	2861140	I don't condone buying this because it looks like single ply and not very comfortable.
2861600	2870462	And our chat room is making all sorts of sophomoric comments that I'm not going to read out loud because it's about first grade humor level, but it is really funny.
2870482	2871202	And we're not?
2871522	2872122	It's really...
2874315	2874695	F.U.s of the Week
2906773	2908454	Yes, it's time for the FUs of the week.
2908534	2911535	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight since DarkSakura is absent.
2911715	2913155	FU to whatever made Jamie sick.
2913976	2915696	Yes, and fuck you.
2916617	2924860	I know this is typical of laptops, but my freaking crotch is on fire from this stupid laptop because this thing is so damn hot.
2925200	2926480	It's just not even funny.
2927100	2928541	Could somebody please wiki quote that?
2928601	2930382	My crotch is on fire from this laptop.
2930402	2931022	That would be awesome.
2931042	2931322	Thank you.
2932534	2934295	They're going to take me out of my page anyway.
2934395	2936836	Your wiki quote thing got queued for deletion, didn't it?
2937157	2939138	Yeah, it's because somebody out there is bitter.
2939318	2939858	It's not me.
2940058	2940659	I didn't do it.
2940699	2941639	Yes, I know it wasn't you.
2941919	2943360	Save the wiki quote page.
2943400	2947082	Actually, somebody suggested to move it to an Orange Lounge Radio wiki quote page.
2947102	2949724	And I like that idea because I want to get quoted once in a while too.
2950044	2952565	I say some pretty profound things in the show once in a while, don't I?
2953106	2953386	Don't I?
2953926	2954226	Don't I?
2954526	2954806	Yes.
2954967	2955207	Okay.
2956648	2957728	Save the wiki quote.
2957748	2958188	All right, anyway.
2958509	2958929	Yeah, that...
2959861	2961602	Typical, fuck you, slow drivers.
2961662	2963464	Because they're out there, they're out there in numbers.
2963764	2976314	And it seems like every time I'm trying to go someplace, you know, and get there in a timely manner, there's always someone that has to drive 30 miles an hour while, you know, sticking their hand out the window pretending it's like a fucking wing or something that they're flying a plane with their hand.
2976654	2979596	I'm like, fucking drive instead of playing with your goddamn arm!
2980117	2981738	So, you know, that's it.
2982979	2983359	Alright.
2983699	2986241	Spike, do you have any FUs that you want to give out?
2986442	2989624	Or are you in a good, happy, huggy, tree-hugging mood
2990239	2994203	The only F view that I can really think of, it's really minor.
2994743	3001169	I'm really bothered by the edits that Square Enix made to Kingdom Hearts 2 for a US release.
3001490	3007335	And they were talking in the chatroom about it, and you know, it's not really a big deal, and that's absolutely correct.
3008256	3014282	But it still seems pointless to me to change guns to not look so realistic in Kingdom Hearts.
3015430	3019052	Do that because Kingdom Hearts they think is more of a kids game because of the Disney element?
3019292	3020273	I would expect so.
3020653	3029679	I read on, I think it was Kotaku, but don't quote me on that, that it actually helped them to get a younger rating by changing the guns to look more cartoony.
3030999	3037704	But, I just, it bothers me that such a little thing could make such a big difference, you know?
3039204	3045008	We can't, like, stop, you know, 187 from, you know, people killing people, but...
3045816	3045956	My F.U.
3045976	3046316	goes to Konami.
3074093	3078336	and I realized that this show, if it weren't for DDR, we probably wouldn't be doing this show.
3079197	3082039	But seriously, Konami, fuck you this week.
3082079	3082539	You know why?
3083119	3086181	Because you are also in the business of making slot machines.
3087582	3091465	And those slot machines stole $60 from me at the casino the other night.
3091585	3097388	So F you, you makers of one-armed bandits that steal my money and don't give me any back.
3097869	3101171	Although I could definitely go for a Suikoden slot machine.
3101191	3101351	Correct.
3103939	3105613	Yeah, how about a Rumble Roses slot machine?
3106331	3106771	You know what?
3107071	3108892	Maybe that's a future list list we need to do.
3108992	3110573	A slot machine we'd like to see Konami make.
3110974	3112655	Does Konami do the fortune cookie one?
3112675	3113775	That one is hilarious.
3113935	3116156	It's the most racist slot machine I've ever seen.
3116497	3127983	The fortune cookie, and you play it, and if you get all the fortune cookies, then the guy who runs the Chinese restaurant comes up and goes, This is Mr. Lucky's Chinese... I'm like, it's the most racist thing I've ever seen in my life.
3128403	3128703	One of them.
3129264	3131485	And I'm just like, is that Konami that made that?
3131545	3131905	I don't know.
3132085	3134887	Oh no, if you win on my money, I have no money to buy rice!
3135427	3136087	It's horrible.
3136207	3136828	It's horrible.
3137348	3139249	I'm not making this up.
3139389	3142871	Go to a casino if you're over 18, 21, whatever the age is in your state.
3143172	3145433	Go to a casino and check out that fortune cookie machine.
3146033	3147414	And actually play it for a little bit.
3147454	3147814	It's bad.
3150776	3151056	Anyway.
3152337	3152917	Moving on.
3153177	3153638	Loki.
3154798	3156379	There is a sequel being made.
3156959	3157480	Finally.
3158020	3159501	After many failed attempts.
3160261	3160942	A game that I love.
3161122	3161782	Exactly.
3162142	3162923	Pilotwings.
3163442	3164082	It makes sense.
3164122	3165903	They're going to put one on the revolution.
3167304	3173407	But that's basically rumored according to EGM on the latest issue.
3173727	3177729	They had it in their rumor section, so it makes sense.
3177849	3183852	I would think so, especially with the remote, the revmote or whatever, and the way you would be able to use that in the game.
3183952	3187474	It sounds like it would be gimmicky enough to where they would do that.
3188956	3189637	Thanks for watching!
3200975	3208401	and you would have maybe a Smash Brothers and maybe Metroid and Pilotwings.
3208421	3209382	I'm trying to think what else.
3209722	3210323	Pokemon.
3210823	3212084	Pokemon Beatdown.
3212184	3214847	I still have a hard time believing that all these games are going to be out at launch.
3214927	3217809	Unless you mean by at launch, like the first six months.
3218349	3219070	That I would believe.
3219350	3221512	But 50 games, like the week the system comes out?
3221932	3222433	Hell no.
3223133	3223714	Hell no.
3224795	3229679	Well, I do think that, if anything, the first party games will be there because obviously they've been working on those the longest.
3230402	3235905	If Nintendo has 20 first party games out on launch day, I will do something crazy.
3236266	3237066	Give me something to do.
3237306	3237827	I will do it.
3238187	3241169	Well, let me see.
3241209	3245171	I can't remember if it's 20 games or 20% of the 50 games.
3245571	3247192	Oh, that's a little different.
3247212	3247913	That's a little bit different.
3247933	3249754	Now we're changing our story, aren't we, a little bit?
3250334	3253956	I remember the number 50, 50 games, but 20% of them.
3254076	3258199	How about $50 for 20 games that will be available in the first month?
3258339	3259740	I think that's more realistic.
3260686	3261127	I don't know.
3262088	3263010	We'll just see it at E3.
3277566	3281208	Rub myself in $340 worth of pudding, says DJ Poo Eater.
3281528	3282068	How about this?
3282388	3284089	Maybe I won't go for $340.
3284409	3290532	However, if Nintendo puts out 20 games on the launch day, it has to be on the day, otherwise it doesn't count.
3290572	3297316	If Nintendo puts out 20 days, I will get a six-pack of those Jell-O pudding things and rub it all over myself live on air.
3298442	3299542	Can we take photos?
3299763	3300703	Yes, can we take photos?
3300823	3301243	Awesome.
3301443	3302004	Take video.
3302344	3304785	Alright, you can do a video and put it on our PSP.
3304805	3309947	But remember, Nintendo has to release 20 games on the launch day, and it's not going to happen.
3311027	3312448	So I can feel comfortable saying that.
3313668	3313929	Alright.
3316209	3319451	To which our chatroom is having a little bit of a scary thought there.
3319471	3320851	What, did DarkTetsuya have a better idea?
3322712	3323232	What did he say?
3323272	3324473	Would you say Spike in the chatroom?
3325641	3328223	DarkTetsuya asks, will you go straight?
3328283	3332165	If I would go straight, you know, I think the person I'm seeing will have a big problem with that.
3332586	3334567	If I went straight suddenly over a stupid bet.
3335388	3336608	I think he'd laugh.
3337529	3338430	250 jello shots.
3339410	3339991	I'll die.
3342332	3347536	No, we'll do Rob's Puddin' Adventure and put it on OLR PSP.
3348096	3349417	Remember, it's got to be 20 games.
3349437	3349417	19?
3349957	3351098	Doesn't work.
3352519	3351098	21?
3353099	3353700	Maybe I'll get 7.
3356687	3361071	Well, wouldn't 20% of 50 be 10 anyways?
3361231	3363313	Wouldn't 20% of 50 be 10 anyways?
3364214	3364454	Yeah.
3364855	3365936	So how about 10 games?
3369600	3371301	It would make for compelling radio.
3371442	3372202	I don't know.
3372302	3374364	See, 10 might be realistic to me.
3375626	3377107	How many did they have on GameCube at launch?
3377348	3378288	They only had like 4 or 5.
3378429	3379590	On the day the system came out?
3381803	3383104	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3411414	3413776	Xbox 360 got a new demo this week.
3413836	3415977	It's the demo for Tomb Raider Legend.
3416077	3421321	It hit the store and was on Tuesday, April 4th is when that demo went to the store.
3421961	3422442	The Marketplace.
3423042	3424683	I keep saying the store, but the Marketplace.
3424963	3427965	I actually went and I downloaded it and it sucked.
3428286	3428946	I didn't like it at all.
3429266	3429787	It's pretty.
3430902	3431782	But not pretty enough.
3432003	3435744	I thought the framerate was not where it should be for an next-gen system.
3436524	3440586	I felt the gameplay feels about 10 years old, like an old Tomb Raider game.
3441006	3443648	And I was bored, and I didn't even finish the demo.
3443828	3445628	I thought it was craptacular.
3445929	3447529	Didn't like it, not gonna buy the game.
3447889	3449450	And I thought the controls were crap, too.
3449770	3452512	It doesn't feel fluid to me.
3453492	3459194	Unless something big changes between this demo and the final release, I am in no way interested in Tomb Raider Legends.
3460135	3460355	Loki?
3461094	3466356	I watched someone play the game and I did like some of the details that they had in, like the water effects looked pretty cool.
3466376	3467416	I thought the water effects were crap.
3467456	3471437	Did you get to a point where you were like behind the waterfall and the camera would get behind the waterfall?
3471457	3472237	It looked like crap.
3472497	3474758	It looked like a bunch of snow, like white snow on the screen.
3474778	3475218	I didn't see that.
3475258	3481540	But anyways, I did like the smoke coming out of the guns, even though it looked kind of blocky, but still kind of neat.
3481980	3484981	And the voice acting, I guess, was okay.
3485401	3487642	But I don't like Tomb Raider, period.
3487862	3488302	And so...
3489150	3490010	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3519978	3523582	Gizem in our chatroom says, bah, on the Tomb Raider, hey, I like the demo.
3523622	3524683	Hey, to each their own.
3524743	3526205	I'm sure there's people that disagree with me.
3526225	3527025	In fact, I know there are.
3527326	3529768	In reading some websites and things, there's people that disagree with me.
3530269	3531170	I didn't like it.
3531310	3532992	I just didn't get what the big deal is.
3533513	3534253	Didn't sell me on it.
3534414	3534714	Sorry.
3535295	3536436	Maybe it's just not my kind of game.
3537228	3537568	I don't know.
3537628	3540129	I'm not huge on the platformers anymore.
3540589	3549192	I used to like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro and those type of games, but I don't know how huge... But that's not true, because Mario I still like and those types of things.
3549252	3553273	So I don't know what Tomb Raider's problem is, but I didn't like it.
3554134	3554414	Sorry.
3556554	3558595	Moving on to another story.
3560575	3560956	Loki!
3561456	3564358	Lots of stuff going on with Oblivion this week, right?
3564398	3565698	Lots of controversy and things?
3565879	3567800	Yeah, lots of stuff.
3567820	3569181	There's more like it.
3569901	3576785	They had this stupid... I don't even know why the hell anyone would buy this, but they had this stupid thing that they put on the marketplace.
3577465	3578666	It's a horse armor pack.
3578686	3581027	And I remember talking about this a while back when they announced this.
3581668	3584049	And it's basically just like it sounds.
3584389	3585250	Horse armor pack.
3586414	3588856	But it's not different stats or anything, right?
3589596	3592258	I guess your horse is armored now, a little bit.
3593158	3593719	Here's the thing.
3594339	3596461	It costs you money, first off.
3596481	3598302	200 Microsoft points, which is, I think, about $3.
3599763	3602284	And you have to buy the armor in the game.
3602625	3604066	You don't just get the armor.
3604466	3605847	It just makes it available for purchase.
3606968	3609389	Oh, so you don't even get the armor on your horse automatically.
3609409	3610710	You still have to work for it in the game.
3610890	3611070	Yeah.
3611471	3612151	That's crappy.
3613392	3613552	And...
3614130	3615171	To be honest, it looks stupid.
3615972	3628202	So basically, I'm paying $2 for a graphic file that's probably 400 pixels by 400 pixels that's going to be laid around my horse in a shapely way.
3628622	3629363	That's what I'm paying for.
3630304	3632906	I'm paying for a sprite.
3633887	3634747	You're not paying for a sprite.
3634767	3636969	You're paying for a polygon model.
3637109	3637770	Oh, sorry.
3638210	3639371	But still, yeah.
3639391	3639892	Same difference.
3642274	3642574	I don't know.
3643055	3643835	I think it's stupid.
3644036	3648318	Then again, I know enough people obsessed with Oblivion that they're probably excited about this.
3665305	3666446	There, you're at the town.
3666786	3669008	I mean, you don't have to ride a horse anywhere.
3669048	3670009	It's not required.
3670549	3671910	So, who cares?
3672250	3681157	And besides, I heard there's a part in the game where you can actually get a horse that is armored or, like, undead or something, and it basically can't be hurt anyways.
3681557	3684099	So, what's the point in getting a horse armor anyways?
3685220	3685860	You know what, though?
3685880	3690604	For all of this common sense... And you're not going to show it to any of your friends anyways because the game's not on live, so...
3691607	3692307	Who cares?
3692928	3708296	For all of this common sense, though, I saw on LiveJournal at least 20 people who had talked about purchasing this pack as a positive thing, as buying upgrades for so small amounts of money being a good thing in the direction that gaming is going.
3708536	3709557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3730174	3738079	Well, it's tough, because Halo was even weirder, because the maps were free, but you could buy them three months in advance for so much amount of money.
3738379	3739900	That was always kind of weird to me, too.
3740180	3748365	But a lot of things on the original Xbox would be free, like additional maps and things on different games, and costumes and things.
3748705	3757771	The only things that I remember paying for would be songs in DDR, which to me is a little different, because you're really adding to the game...
3758351	3762613	by getting brand new songs to play and step charts and everything, but I don't know.
3763013	3764554	Maybe people would disagree with me and say that's a waste.
3764574	3773218	The reason why they charged what they did for this is because Cameo, they have the new costume things, and that's what they charge for their costumes, so they took it as an example to charge that for it.
3774439	3775499	Well, that's kind of crappy, too.
3775760	3776580	I'm excited.
3776660	3781903	Cameo's retarded in the fact that you can download costumes that do nothing other than reskin the character.
3782083	3784564	But you can dress like Killer Instinct characters.
3787659	3789280	Who cares?
3790561	3791181	Who cares?
3791682	3793303	That doesn't make Cameo better.
3793583	3794083	Including Orkut.
3794103	3795504	Nothing would make Cameo better.
3795904	3796124	Yes.
3796225	3796965	Well, that's kind of cool.
3797125	3798286	But I'm still not going to pay for that.
3799547	3800467	I'm not going to pay for that.
3802268	3803049	Horse armor.
3803910	3804530	Seriously?
3806051	3806431	I don't know.
3807732	3809253	Why would you need horse armor anyways?
3809493	3813676	I have a hard enough time killing somebody that's a human, let alone a horse.
3816874	3818915	What else have they modded in Oblivion lately?
3820516	3822677	Other things that they've modded in Oblivion.
3823217	3830721	Well, like most things that have to do with the PC, they have released a topless mod.
3831201	3831782	That's right.
3832302	3836024	Your Oblivion characters, or female characters, can go wild.
3837444	3840006	And they have this patch out there.
3840026	3840466	Apparently...
3841269	3842910	All they've done is remove the clothing.
3843070	3848034	This skin was already in there, so I guess you can kind of almost say, Oh, no!
3848535	3852157	It's, you know, a hot coffee mod type thing without sex.
3852377	3862925	But, yeah, pretty much there's really nasty, ugly people because, of course, any character you generate with the character generator is ugly that are naked.
3863306	3865027	So, really nasty, ugly, naked people.
3866148	3866288	Enjoy.
3866308	3866408	Enjoy.
3868314	3872658	Why is it whenever there's a game that comes out, somebody finds out a way to make the lead character naked?
3873559	3874780	I mean, always, without fail.
3874880	3875901	You want to hear something funny?
3876121	3877082	This is a great story.
3877202	3877742	I don't know.
3878103	3878483	Do I?
3878903	3882226	This is about Tomb Raider, and about how it might be delayed.
3882587	3894277	Apparently, and this is why here, there is a certain scene in the game where, I'm not sure if it's Lara Croft or if it's one of the other sub-characters that's in there, but
3894884	3895324	Thanks for watching!
3912335	3913576	So popping out would not be good.
3914616	3917297	Gizem says, OMG, I need the PC version now.
3917377	3917978	Fat, fat, fat.
3918378	3922320	Laser123454321 says, Girls Gone Wild in Oblivion.
3923300	3926401	Fireboma says you can be like that guy who was wanking off to World of Warcraft.
3927062	3931684	Oblivion, I think it's great that they have a PC mod thing so you can actually mod PC versions.
3932024	3938327	But that's another thing, too, is then why would I want to buy the horse armor mod for the PC if I can just mod it for free?
3940148	3940468	I don't know.
3942190	3942590	All right.
3943431	3949096	Moving on, we're going to go to another story here, and it's actually a contest.
3950778	3951418	That's right.
3952039	3958444	We are giving away some prize packs from 24 The Game.
3960026	3963269	We were kind enough to get passed along some prize packs for 24 The Game.
3963289	3965391	We're going to give it away on tonight's program.
3966773	3968874	and all you have to do is send us an email.
3968934	3982780	The email is jack24 at orangeloungeradio.com That's all one word, jack24 at orangeloungeradio.com The prize pack includes a copy of the game, a CTU t-shirt or a You Don't Know Jack t-shirt, a 24 mouse pad,
3984401	3988786	A 24 coffee mug and a 24 keychain all comes with us.
3988826	3992149	All you have to do, send us an email, jack24 at orangelaunchradio.com.
3992590	3997215	And if you've been watching the show 24 this season, you know that the body count has been through the roof this season.
3997475	3999898	It's almost annoying how many people have died.
3999938	4001539	Like tons of people's favorites have died.
4001840	4003622	All you have to do, do a little research.
4004429	4006049	And hopefully you're a fan of the show and you already know.
4006349	4010090	Tell me any two people that have died this season.
4010750	4012791	Any two people that have died this season on the show.
4013171	4022793	And that will qualify you to win the 24 prize pack, copy of the game, CTU t-shirt or You Don't Know Jack t-shirt, 24 mouse pad, 24 coffee mug, and a 24 keychain.
4022813	4024893	That's jack24 at orangehauntradio.com.
4025213	4027214	Any two people that have died in season 5 of 24.
4028274	4031335	Random extra number 1 and random extra number 2, that doesn't count.
4031475	4033475	You have to give me names of actual characters, okay?
4034383	4035604	Main characters.
4036444	4038665	Or even supplemental characters will work.
4038685	4040046	Because main characters is a little vague.
4040386	4042847	So it's got to be somebody that has a name.
4042967	4043587	Let's put it that way.
4043627	4044528	So random extra.
4044568	4048330	Like if you saw the episode where people were dropping like flies at CTU, then work.
4048370	4050611	Unless you can name me specific people that were involved in that.
4051391	4051751	Good luck.
4052011	4052432	Excellent.
4052732	4053172	Good luck.
4053512	4057974	By the way, in segment B, we're going to give away an Amped 3 prize pack.
4057994	4058635	So stay tuned.
4058955	4059415	It's awesome.
4060075	4060676	It's a great game.
4061276	4061556	All right.
4062344	4064325	Moving on, let's go to another story.
4065306	4070208	We have an open letter from Sony Online Entertainment to PC Gamer Magazine.
4070248	4071389	This was kind of interesting.
4071709	4074910	Sony Online Entertainment actually wrote to the magazine.
4075311	4084055	You may remember that PC Gamer Magazine said they were no longer going to accept ads from gill sellers and gold sellers and other types of currency sellers.
4084075	4085316	They were not going to put this in their magazine.
4085676	4087997	And Sony Online Entertainment wrote this letter.
4088517	4090938	And Joystick is actually where I got a copy of this letter from.
4090958	4091919	You can check it out over there.
4092619	4104070	In this letter they were saying that these companies that sell these and the farmers that usually accompany their services have been as much of an issue for our company as they are for your readers, the people who play online games.
4104470	4109855	Over the last few years the problems associated with the secondary market have impacted Sony Online Entertainment greatly.
4110335	4113418	Blah blah blah blah blah, gold farmers are evil, blah blah blah blah blah.
4113758	4116640	But this is the part of the letter I think that's interesting.
4117620	4130308	We have taken substantial steps towards solving these and other problems, as well as balancing the desires of those who wish to engage in legitimate real money transactions by launching Station Exchange in EverQuest 2.
4130968	4134270	We will continue to develop innovative solutions in the future.
4135131	4140554	So in other words, what they're saying is that selling things for money is bad unless it's us doing it.
4141755	4141995	Right?
4142907	4144048	It's bad, okay?
4144128	4146208	As long as we get a cut, it's good.
4146388	4149750	Does anything strike somebody funny there about that?
4155172	4156953	Isn't there a weird inconsistency there?
4157113	4160334	I mean, couldn't they have just left that part out in their little letter?
4160734	4163696	The little plug for their service for selling things?
4163896	4164556	Yeah, I think so.
4165697	4165857	Yeah.
4166477	4166777	I don't know.
4167177	4167757	Just my thought.
4167777	4168958	All right.
4169521	4171803	Questions on the 24 Contest coming from the chatroom.
4171844	4174586	Fireboma asks, does it have to be from this season?
4176388	4179251	Yes, they have to be from Season 5 for the 24 Contest.
4179291	4185557	Jack24 at OrangeLunchRadio.com News story.
4186197	4188840	Loki, IGN, what did they report this week?
4189761	4191783	They reported stuff that I reported weeks ago.
4192558	4198082	Basically saying that Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam is going to be a Revolution launch title.
4198722	4208990	I reported this back when we had the Activision list from the Destination PlayStation event.
4209570	4212532	So blow me, IGN.
4212992	4214233	I reported that weeks ago.
4214894	4215614	Where were you?
4217095	4218076	Maybe you're the source.
4218897	4224461	Well, that'd be surprising to me since they didn't mention a source, so yeah, it could possibly be.
4225622	4228724	But, hey, what do you expect?
4228984	4230966	Another launch game, Tony Hawk, cool.
4232087	4232407	Alright.
4235329	4242154	One more story for you guys, this segment of the program, and it has to do with, oh, who doesn't love Bob Ross?
4242174	4242194	I
4242873	4243854	I love Bob Ross.
4243874	4246217	I remember Bob Ross from when I was a kid.
4246517	4248780	I mean, who doesn't love a white man with an afro?
4248900	4249260	Come on.
4250521	4251422	Unless he's Napoleon Dynamite.
4251442	4252624	Bob Ross was awesome.
4252804	4254946	Bob Ross was totally awesome.
4255587	4256808	And Bob Ross is actually...
4257679	4258460	and DarkSakura.com
4281470	4290641	Whoever owns the rights to him now, they contacted him and they said, the press release is not a joke, but the side effect of people thinking it might help us get noticed.
4290901	4297068	But they really are going to make a game for the DS and the Revolution to teach you how to paint your own happy little tree.
4298095	4299156	I am so excited.
4299476	4302298	I can't draw for shit, but I will pick up these games.
4303159	4305601	Why don't they release this for the PC, too?
4305841	4308483	Using a stylus or something?
4308563	4311065	Those tablet things, because I know Jamie bought one of those.
4311105	4313047	She paid good money for those tablets.
4313087	4316129	I don't think enough people own those, but I think it's a good idea.
4318411	4318691	Who knows?
4321534	4325477	My question is, is this the next logical evolution of a Mario Paint type game?
4326641	4327922	That's a very good question.
4328102	4334428	I mean, we haven't seen Mario Paint on any system lately, and I'm kind of surprised we haven't seen it on the DS yet.
4334888	4340713	Doesn't Mario Paint seem like a totally logical idea for the DS, especially with the whole dual screen thing?
4340733	4346739	I mean, you could be painting on the bottom screen, and the upper screen could be showing coordinated music or animation.
4347079	4351503	I mean, let's face it, Mario Paint for the Super Nintendo, it kind of sucked.
4352406	4357170	I mean, a lot of us have fond memories of it, and the things that were in Nintendo Power.
4357470	4365397	I remember Nintendo Power had a little guide, and you could create your own little things from it, like the musics and the animations.
4365538	4366999	It would show you how to do it step by step.
4367299	4372003	But in the big scope of things, you could only really do nine frames of a small animation.
4372344	4373364	That's really shitty.
4373765	4378369	I mean, we have fond memories of it, but it really wasn't that great.
4380030	4384291	Now, I think a game like that could be pretty awesome, especially with, hello, Wi-Fi.
4384711	4386432	I could beam things across.
4386692	4392053	This could be like the evolution of PictoChat and maybe a way to commercialize PictoChat and get a little money off it.
4392073	4396214	Because think about Mario Paint could be like something you could chat with people online.
4396814	4399555	I wonder if they're going to include PictoChat as part of the revolution.
4400882	4401302	Possibly.
4401322	4402523	Over the internet.
4402664	4402944	Who knows?
4402984	4407347	But then are we going to get close to PictoRape that we were talking about earlier?
4407367	4411751	Oh, you mean like... Well, no, because you know Nintendo would say everybody has to be on the friends list.
4412111	4413172	They have to be your friends list.
4413893	4414754	People.
4415154	4418217	Did you know in Metroid you can't voice chat with people unless they're your friends list people?
4418737	4418837	Oh.
4419097	4419358	Yeah.
4419838	4421199	So that whole like, ooh, voice chat.
4421499	4427604	I have maybe like two people on my Metroid friends list and I haven't really played Metroid lately because of all these other damn games that have come out.
4428025	4428125	So...
4429042	4433083	I wonder if Bob Ross and his happy little trees, they'll probably be M-rated, you know.
4434024	4442607	Yeah, because of the fact that I might be able to paint a penis or a vagina in this game, which is likely to be the first thing many of you try to paint.
4442747	4444347	Would it be a happy little vagina?
4445168	4447789	It would be a very happy little penis or vagina.
4450549	4453490	Does this game have to be rated M because of what you can do with your imagination?
4454651	4454931	I don't know.
4455595	4460276	Can you imagine some parent suing Bob Ross Foundation or whatever over this horrible, horrific game?
4460776	4462277	My kid painted a penis!
4467758	4472039	And on that note, I think we're going to go ahead and go to our break.
4472599	4473579	So stay tuned.
4473659	4476560	We'll come back at you a little later with Part B of tonight's show.
