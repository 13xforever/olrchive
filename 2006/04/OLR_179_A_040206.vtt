00:00.000 --> 00:20.320
Today, April 2nd, 2006. April Fools hits the web, but is Final Fantasy 13 a joke? Is the

00:20.320 --> 00:28.040
Xbox 360 drought finally over? And are UMD movies about to meet an untimely fate?

00:28.040 --> 00:37.720
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.720 --> 00:43.000
We are here gathered together to talk about video games, our favorites and sometimes our

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
least favorites.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.120
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.120
You might know me as Sky.

00:46.120 --> 00:56.120
Joining me, as always, say hello to the lovely co-host, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers, and also

00:56.120 --> 00:59.960
Also in corner number two, say hello to the not-so-lovely Loki.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.960
Hey, how you doing?

01:01.960 --> 01:02.960
Good.

01:02.960 --> 01:03.960
Alright.

01:03.960 --> 01:04.960
Dark Sakura.

01:04.960 --> 01:05.960
What?

01:05.960 --> 01:06.960
I see you eating food here.

01:06.960 --> 01:07.960
Did you bring enough to share?

01:07.960 --> 01:08.960
No.

01:08.960 --> 01:09.960
What's this you're munching on?

01:09.960 --> 01:10.960
I'm responsible for my own dinner.

01:10.960 --> 01:11.960
Alright, what's this you're munching on?

01:11.960 --> 01:19.320
I'm eating an organic unbleached flour mushroom leek strudel with black sesame seeds on it.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.760
I'm not sure what to think of that.

01:20.760 --> 01:21.920
That sounds a little...

01:21.920 --> 01:22.920
Ew.

01:22.920 --> 01:23.920
It's delicious!

01:23.920 --> 01:26.520
I don't know if it's ew, but it just it sounds very intimidating

01:26.520 --> 01:27.460
It's like it's like, you know

01:27.460 --> 01:32.640
Those people that get married and have hyphenated last names and then their kids get married and all have like the hyphenated last names

01:32.640 --> 01:34.640
That's what it sounds like. You just ate

01:34.960 --> 01:37.840
Like eight of those names. It's it's very delicious

01:37.840 --> 01:44.960
I I do a lot of my shopping now at Whole Foods markets, which is all organic food. It's expensive. It is expensive

01:44.960 --> 01:45.600
Oh my god

01:45.600 --> 01:51.840
but I have felt so healthy the last two months since I've started eating all organic and vegetarian and

01:51.840 --> 01:55.360
and cut out red meat and I don't drink soda anymore.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.000
I had a soda yesterday.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.600
I had a diet vanilla Pepsi and it made my stomach hurt.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.480
I still drink diet but I try very hard

02:04.480 --> 02:05.320
not to drink regular soda.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.920
I make my own soda now.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.440
I buy club soda and Torani, the flavored syrup.

02:10.440 --> 02:11.640
Oh, so kind of like Italian soda.

02:11.640 --> 02:12.880
Yeah, I do Italian sodas.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.920
Okay, oh, because you can get the sugar-free ones.

02:14.920 --> 02:15.760
Those aren't so bad.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.040
And I also make carbonated lemonade.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.720
using club soda and lemon juice

02:21.720 --> 02:25.540
and lime juice and Splenda. Not for me. I like ice cream tea.

02:25.540 --> 02:29.040
That's my drink of choice. Anyway, we're starting to sound like Food Network over here. Sorry guys.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.480
I have been all about the cooking though. I've really been...

02:32.480 --> 02:36.680
I need Iron Chef the game. What would you recommend? Make this gaming related

02:36.680 --> 02:40.280
somewhat. What would you recommend gamers who are typically

02:40.280 --> 02:44.640
sitting there with a bag of Doritos playing, you know, EverQuest all night

02:44.640 --> 02:45.000
long?

02:45.000 --> 02:49.320
What's a good recommendation for them to like break that habit? What's something

02:49.320 --> 02:52.520
else they could do to feed their snack addiction or what have you?

02:52.520 --> 02:56.240
Carrots. Sliced apples.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.600
Popcorn. You know, like some plain popcorn.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.720
Soy nuts. They're good. Cashews.

03:02.720 --> 03:06.440
Cashews are very good for you. They have good oils. And brown rice.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.520
And super bacon. No super bacon.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.800
That's bad for you. That's like a heart attack recipe right there.

03:12.800 --> 03:16.920
Alright, let's get away from the Food Network and do a little bit of how was your gaming

03:16.920 --> 03:17.920
week?

03:17.920 --> 03:20.400
The part of the show where we talk about what we've been playing this week and what we've

03:20.400 --> 03:21.400
been up to.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.320
And I know I've got a lot, I don't know about the others, but DarkSakura, you always start

03:25.320 --> 03:26.320
us off.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.320
What have you been playing this week?

03:27.320 --> 03:30.920
Well, we've had quite a bit of new gaming coming in the house.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.840
I've actually got BeatMania, been playing the crap out of it.

03:33.840 --> 03:37.520
I have Kingdom Hearts 2, but since I was already playing it in Japanese I've been sort of not

03:37.520 --> 03:38.720
so much about that.

03:38.720 --> 03:43.000
I'm going to start over on that probably within the week after I get my stupid flash

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
homework done.

03:44.000 --> 03:52.360
Um, and I'm also, we, uh, Fries, of all places, is carrying import, um, PSP games.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.760
I noticed that last time I went to Fries, for those, because we're nationwide, Fries

03:55.760 --> 03:59.240
is a big electronics chain on the west coast, and they've started to carry limited import

03:59.240 --> 04:00.240
games.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.240
We bought Initial D!

04:01.240 --> 04:02.240
Oh wow!

04:02.240 --> 04:03.240
That's cool.

04:03.240 --> 04:06.440
The, the new Initial D game is really, really cool, it's based off of, I think, the version

04:06.440 --> 04:12.800
three that's out in the arcade and it's really pretty it's eurobeat fantastic

04:12.800 --> 04:18.920
lots and lots of eurobeat but it's it's initial d I guess not much else I can

04:18.920 --> 04:22.560
say about that they're also had out the title collection that we're sort of

04:22.560 --> 04:25.640
considering except that it's coming out in the u.s. sort of like a no point to

04:25.640 --> 04:29.160
that and we almost picked up a guilty gear but that's also coming out in the

04:29.160 --> 04:34.640
u.s. so we were sort of not so much on that too but and Dan and his friend have

04:34.640 --> 04:40.800
been playing a whole lot of burnout oh my god I'm so tired of that game

04:40.800 --> 04:46.200
well why am I so tired of the burnout just anything over and over I'm in my

04:46.200 --> 04:51.800
okay my computer room is on the other side of where our big TV is so I'm in

04:51.800 --> 04:55.440
the middle of working on like my my flash homework right now is to do this

04:55.440 --> 04:58.800
big photo slideshow so I've been trying to get my photos all together and I'm

04:58.800 --> 05:10.320
just about to do my last little touch great and then we've also had a MAME

05:10.320 --> 05:15.360
action going on because one of Dan's co-workers and a friend of mine George

05:15.360 --> 05:20.900
neko boy right he and our friend Tim who is actually for anyone who's in cosplay

05:20.900 --> 05:25.560
circles he is very well known because he does the fabulous Rick Hunter Macross

05:25.560 --> 05:31.960
outfit. He did Ava One at Anime Expo. He's been in Japanese cosplay photos. He also

05:31.960 --> 05:35.840
has been helping build main cabinets in my garage.

05:35.840 --> 05:39.640
So you have more than one now? We're building George.

05:39.640 --> 05:43.160
We haven't talked about this on the show in a while, but both Dark

05:43.160 --> 05:46.480
Sakura and Loki have main cabinets in their house. Now Dark Sakura, you guys

05:46.480 --> 05:50.440
took a pole position? We took a stand-up pole position. They're building this

05:50.440 --> 05:55.200
one out of some other generic one, but it has this fabulous 1982

05:55.200 --> 05:59.160
aren't on it and so it's it's like really super cool but they were they

05:59.160 --> 06:02.580
were working on this all day while me and the fabulous miss Tia were running

06:02.580 --> 06:05.540
around where where did they get the specs on how to do this like are they

06:05.540 --> 06:10.580
doing it off a website off of just crash and burn there is a website and if you

06:10.580 --> 06:15.120
give me just a second I can get it because um it's the one that my husband

06:15.120 --> 06:18.960
goes to which happens to be on my favorites bar called it's a arcade

06:18.960 --> 06:23.200
controls comm slash arcade dot HTM is basically build your own arcade

06:23.200 --> 06:28.620
controls FAQ this is how to build your it goes a lot into the cabinets it goes

06:28.620 --> 06:31.980
into how to build the controllers what you need for it it's really really neat

06:31.980 --> 06:37.940
um and actually I'll talk to Dan about getting the specs on his cabinet so if

06:37.940 --> 06:43.540
anybody else is interested all right sounds cool yeah all right Loki how was

06:43.540 --> 06:47.740
your gaming week play any of your main cabinet now you actually built your

06:47.740 --> 06:52.060
cabinet you didn't convert a machine you built a brand new yes and it shows we

06:52.060 --> 06:57.300
You were roommates back when you were building that, and I just remember that was a project.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.620
Yeah, to say the least.

07:00.620 --> 07:05.260
Most of the project is being stored at my parents' house over in their garage because

07:05.260 --> 07:10.800
the, like what, six other control panels that go with it, I don't have any room to store

07:10.800 --> 07:13.820
them if I were to even build them.

07:13.820 --> 07:17.500
But soon, as soon as we get a house, that sucker's getting built.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.500
Someday.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.500
Alright, how was your gaming week?

07:20.500 --> 07:27.340
Okay, I played a lot of 360 stuff again, I think I played a little bit of Oblivion, I

07:27.340 --> 07:30.420
played more Outfit, and I realized that game really sucks.

07:30.420 --> 07:31.420
Really?

07:31.420 --> 07:32.420
What?

07:32.420 --> 07:37.260
Now this isn't really my kind of game, so I haven't really been playing a lot of it,

07:37.260 --> 07:41.060
but I've listened to other shows that seem to really like this game, so what's your issue

07:41.060 --> 07:42.060
with it?

07:42.060 --> 07:46.440
It's, well my issue with it, I try to play multiplayer, and again, we're just with two

07:46.440 --> 07:53.440
2 player split screen, which is fine. For one, the controls really suck in it. Like,

07:53.620 --> 07:58.460
I kept calling in the destruction on demand, the big feature where you get stuff to fall

07:58.460 --> 08:04.340
from the sky, and the stuff falling from the sky kept crushing my characters. I would aim

08:04.340 --> 08:10.460
it further away from me, and the stupid piece of crap jeep or whatever I was calling into

08:10.460 --> 08:16.740
battle would get caught in the wind and crush. There goes half my team. So that's actually

08:16.740 --> 08:20.820
you can use that I guess to your advantage if you know you have stupid AI that you're

08:20.820 --> 08:24.820
fighting against you can just call in some destruction on demand and they would drop

08:24.820 --> 08:30.620
a jeep on the other team or something. I don't know but I didn't find it very fun at all.

08:30.620 --> 08:35.940
I did however pick up Far Cry Instincts Predator which I've never played the original Far

08:35.940 --> 08:40.300
Cry Instincts but from what I hear it's not very different as far as graphics and stuff.

08:40.300 --> 08:43.300
a little bit of graphic upgrades and stuff but um...

08:43.300 --> 08:45.700
it is pretty fun. It is kind of...

08:45.700 --> 08:47.300
actually it's very hard

08:47.300 --> 08:49.900
um... very frustrating

08:49.900 --> 08:51.300
so I started to cheat

08:51.300 --> 08:52.940
and now it's fun

08:52.940 --> 08:56.340
I love how they put the cheats in there because cheats make it fun. It's still really

08:56.340 --> 08:59.300
challenging but it kind of

08:59.300 --> 09:01.480
lightens it up a little bit

09:01.480 --> 09:04.740
so I'm kind of looking forward to that and then

09:04.740 --> 09:06.820
played more Burnout, more

09:06.820 --> 09:08.620
Ghost Recon

09:08.620 --> 09:20.260
And uh, here are the cheats working that too. And what else? Me, Mike Katamari, Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City, Stories. All that fun stuff.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.820
I played a little bit of Beatmania. Didn't like it.

09:22.820 --> 09:24.020
Oh, why not?

09:24.020 --> 09:32.620
The interface is too colorful and to be honest I didn't think the new controllers were that great.

09:32.620 --> 09:38.420
And I don't know why. I mean before they seemed to be pretty good but that turntable doesn't seem- it seems to be sticky, the turntable.

09:38.420 --> 09:41.740
and it loosens up after you play with it a bit

09:41.740 --> 09:45.860
and I don't know it's just even new songs were kinda okay but

09:45.860 --> 09:49.540
I just wasn't very impressed by it. It was just kinda

09:49.540 --> 09:53.060
yay cool Beatmania anything

09:53.060 --> 09:56.620
you know to go I'm not gonna go rush out they'll go buy it though

09:56.620 --> 10:01.720
so. Alright. My gaming week also consisted of Beatmania

10:01.720 --> 10:05.780
which I picked up earlier in the week so kinda funny there we've all played that

10:05.780 --> 10:10.580
But, of course, that's not a surprise when you consider that we started as a music gaming station.

10:10.580 --> 10:12.580
Obviously, we owe a lot to Beatmania.

10:12.580 --> 10:15.980
I think it's very interesting, Beatmania, because when you consider it,

10:15.980 --> 10:18.980
Beatmania is about, what, eight years old?

10:18.980 --> 10:23.280
And this is really the first time that it's coming out in the U.S. for console.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.780
I mean, of course, we had the hip-hop mania in the arcades a couple years ago,

10:26.780 --> 10:28.580
but nobody really remembers that.

10:28.580 --> 10:33.080
So, this is really the first time we've had Beatmania or 2DX on a console here.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.520
So it's really BeatMania's first release.

10:35.520 --> 10:40.060
It's really interesting how they've kind of thrown it all together like this blender together

10:40.060 --> 10:44.980
of stuff from the five key world and the seven key world.

10:44.980 --> 10:51.000
As expected, this version is much more accessible to beginners in the fact that there is no

10:51.000 --> 10:57.760
separate mode for beginner mode, but they fuse the beginning level songs into the normal

10:57.760 --> 11:02.700
game, which I think is good because I think you don't want to scare people off because

11:02.700 --> 11:08.420
even though Beatmania is selling itself as bringing the arcade experience home, which

11:08.420 --> 11:13.700
kind of is a little weird to me because there's really nothing but import machines for Beatmania.

11:13.700 --> 11:20.700
It was kind of weird there. I think it's a good first exposure for people. I find it

11:20.700 --> 11:21.700
...

11:21.700 --> 11:24.580
There was a lot of the old Five Key music in there, did you notice?

11:24.580 --> 11:28.220
Oh yeah, I noticed a lot of really old, like Hunting For You and Metal Gear. This is really,

11:28.220 --> 11:31.540
really old songs, but I think that's cool because they picked some good stuff. They

11:31.540 --> 11:35.400
They have a very interesting song list, I think the five key song list is actually pretty

11:35.400 --> 11:36.400
solid.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.640
I think they got a good mix of stuff.

11:37.640 --> 11:43.540
Seven key, for me, could use some more recent stuff, but I think I understand why they're

11:43.540 --> 11:47.220
doing what they're doing, because if there is to be a second mix, then they can start

11:47.220 --> 11:50.720
dipping into the later stuff and things, you know.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.040
Yeah.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.440
Did you like the Moby song?

11:53.440 --> 11:55.760
I did like the Moby song, I like the video.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.600
I think the Timo Ma song's the best, though.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.880
Dan and I sat there with the Moby song going, what is this?

12:01.880 --> 12:06.400
I liked it, I think it's good. Dan and I are both like Moby, but we just didn't like that one.

12:06.400 --> 12:10.160
Here's the interesting thing is that I notice this in a lot of reviews. BeatMania has

12:10.160 --> 12:12.880
been getting a lot of negative reviews out there on the circuit right now

12:12.880 --> 12:16.200
and a lot of people can't seem to

12:16.200 --> 12:19.880
not want to compare this to Guitar Hero. Everybody's comparing this game to Guitar

12:19.880 --> 12:20.460
Hero, which

12:20.460 --> 12:25.080
I think is kind of funny because this game existed long before Guitar Hero

12:25.080 --> 12:28.880
in the world scope of things but in the US scope of things since its first time

12:28.880 --> 12:30.120
it's getting a release here

12:30.120 --> 12:33.560
you know it's it's inevitable people are gonna compare to Guitar Hero.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.840
It's not like actual reviewers do any research on anything.

12:36.840 --> 12:41.880
Anyway doesn't matter so I think though there is an inevitable comparison to be

12:41.880 --> 12:45.760
made to Guitar Hero though because what Guitar Hero did successfully

12:45.760 --> 12:49.840
and the reason why everybody loves Guitar Hero is the song list

12:49.840 --> 12:52.840
and yes even though they have a bunch of cover songs

12:52.840 --> 12:58.700
They're done. Well, the cover songs are done. Well, they're pretty faithful to the originals and it really ups that fun factor

12:58.900 --> 13:05.200
the problem with beat mania and why I don't think beat mania is gonna have that same buzz as guitar hero is now set the

13:05.200 --> 13:09.640
Bars that a lot of these songs are not recognizable to most people

13:09.640 --> 13:14.260
They tried a little bit with the song list that you know, you got toxic and funky town

13:14.260 --> 13:20.820
Okay, people know those songs, but there's a lot of songs in there. They're not so recognizable. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

13:20.820 --> 13:27.140
That thing, I don't know, I'm spoiled by years of Japanese releases, so I do recognize all

13:27.140 --> 13:28.140
the songs that are in there.

13:28.140 --> 13:32.100
It's hard for me to look at this game impartially when I've been raised on the Japanese series

13:32.100 --> 13:37.140
for years and years.

13:37.140 --> 13:38.140
It's just weird.

13:38.140 --> 13:39.140
I don't really know.

13:39.140 --> 13:41.880
I think it's going to be interesting to see how the general public reacts to this.

13:41.880 --> 13:45.580
Are they going to pick up on this game even though there aren't a lot of recognizable

13:45.580 --> 13:46.580
songs?

13:46.580 --> 13:47.580
I don't know.

13:47.580 --> 13:51.180
last night including some people who don't play games a whole lot and I know

13:51.180 --> 13:53.780
a few of them were really digging on Beatmania they thought it was kind of

13:53.780 --> 13:57.060
fun and very pretty even though they didn't really recognize a lot of the

13:57.060 --> 14:02.180
songs in it so did you notice that three two one stars is the another yeah just

14:02.180 --> 14:08.160
to make it a little harder there plus they they did something weird with five

14:08.160 --> 14:11.060
keys is that there's only the one difficulty I thought that was kind of

14:11.060 --> 14:16.180
odd they just made some very odd changes like the one that really irks me is that

14:16.180 --> 14:21.100
they made the triple A's a lot lower in score to be able to get and just in

14:21.100 --> 14:25.060
general the grading is a little easier and I think I mean look I understand why

14:25.060 --> 14:27.380
they want to do that again they're trying to cater to the beginners and

14:27.380 --> 14:31.580
people haven't seen the game before but I kind of go you have to lower the bar

14:31.580 --> 14:35.420
on triple A's I mean people aren't gonna just get discouraged if they get an A or

14:35.420 --> 14:38.900
a double A on a song but you know did you have to make triple A's easier to get

14:38.900 --> 14:44.660
to like I don't know I don't know overall I like Beatmania and I think

14:44.660 --> 14:48.500
people who are into music games should check it out, and I think it's a very solid first

14:48.500 --> 14:51.900
release, especially when you put it side by side with DDR first mix.

14:51.900 --> 14:55.260
It's a hell of a good first release compared to what DDR first mix was, and I think there's

14:55.260 --> 14:59.940
a potential for really great stuff in the future, and you just kind of have to think,

14:59.940 --> 15:04.580
okay, if Beatmania can grow the same way DDR did, it's going to be great, but you know,

15:04.580 --> 15:08.020
we have to have a little faith here in the beginning, so we'll see what happens.

15:08.020 --> 15:12.540
I want to say hello to our chat room over at www.orangelaungeradio.com.

15:12.540 --> 15:20.780
a chat and always looking for your comments there let's see the 23rd Magus

15:20.780 --> 15:25.020
says I believe this is a response to Guitar Hero they made music games

15:25.020 --> 15:28.580
accessible they made music games accessible it's a very you know

15:28.580 --> 15:31.700
interesting statement is that a lot of people sometimes get put off by the DDR

15:31.700 --> 15:36.220
pad and by the you know turntables and the keys and seeing all those notes

15:36.220 --> 15:38.980
falling but there was something about Guitar Hero was a little different I

15:38.980 --> 15:43.260
I don't know, very interesting.

15:43.260 --> 15:48.360
So again, if you want to join our chat, www.orangelaungerator.com and click on chat.

15:48.360 --> 15:52.160
And 23rd Magus wants to also point out that they actually have the calculations, if you

15:52.160 --> 15:57.360
want to look at calculations for the true AAAs, that there are websites out there that

15:57.360 --> 16:00.440
will let you know how your score compares to the Japanese version.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.420
One of them he's mentioning is VJ Army.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.760
So pretty interesting.

16:04.760 --> 16:10.060
I did notice that it was ridiculously easy, but it was sort of nicer because the good

16:10.060 --> 16:14.940
thing about this is that I could play it with Dan, and Dan's not really a BeatMania person.

16:14.940 --> 16:17.560
He was playing on my old controller.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.560
That's cool.

16:18.560 --> 16:24.400
I felt so bad for him, because really my old controller is now hitting the crappy phase.

16:24.400 --> 16:29.480
I think, and what I call these folks sometimes are the Japanese elitists out there on some

16:29.480 --> 16:33.440
of the websites, that nothing is good enough unless it's the Japanese version.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.360
The American versions will always be shit.

16:35.360 --> 16:39.940
I think the problem with the Japanese elitists out there on the message boards when it comes

16:39.940 --> 16:44.280
to Beatmania is that they forget that these games aren't made for them.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.860
They think that Konami owes them something because they've been buying the games for

16:47.860 --> 16:49.960
years and years.

16:49.960 --> 16:54.460
That got Konami to release the game here, but still, the game is not for you.

16:54.460 --> 16:57.040
It's for everybody.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.620
They'll toss a couple frickin' bones at the loyal supporters.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.500
was a couple night style songs in there and there's there's some you know kind

17:03.500 --> 17:06.100
of neat stuff I think just having the five key and seven key in there is

17:06.100 --> 17:11.100
pretty neat you know but the game's not for you it's for everybody well I

17:11.100 --> 17:14.060
honestly did think that the song selection was pretty sparse in

17:14.060 --> 17:17.580
comparison because think about like the last one that I bought was eighth style

17:17.580 --> 17:22.260
and think about just how many freaking songs were in eighth style but still

17:22.260 --> 17:25.820
when you consider that we have both modes I do sort of wish that you could

17:25.820 --> 17:30.780
do the seven key stuff in five key mode you know to do that too but I see why

17:30.780 --> 17:33.980
they did it the way that they did it really is like you're getting two games

17:33.980 --> 17:39.620
in one just both with very sparse song lists so I recommend beat mania if for

17:39.620 --> 17:42.980
no other reason than I want to see a beat mania second mix released here in

17:42.980 --> 17:46.100
the u.s. and you know it is good I think everybody should at least check it out

17:46.100 --> 17:50.260
you know because even if you're scared of DDR there's no reason to be scared of

17:50.260 --> 17:54.380
beat mania well I know I personally I didn't pick it up because one I know

17:54.380 --> 18:00.220
economics send me a free one too because if it's anything like guitar hero I'll

18:00.220 --> 18:04.860
play it once and not play it for again which I did with my guitar hero it is

18:04.860 --> 18:10.660
leaning up against my main cabinet because eventually it will be used for

18:10.660 --> 18:14.460
good guitar freaks guitar guitar hero is a party game for me it's like it's

18:14.460 --> 18:16.820
sitting there in the corner and then when people come over they go what's

18:16.820 --> 18:20.980
that guitar hero yeah you know and it's you know I think beatmania is gonna be

18:20.980 --> 18:24.300
kind of a similar thing around here I'm still playing in an awful lot but I

18:24.300 --> 18:25.960
I find that I'm gonna use my controller

18:25.960 --> 18:27.380
to go back to the Japanese mixes.

18:27.380 --> 18:28.800
But you know, I'm different.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.620
I'm not like most of the people listening to this show.

18:30.620 --> 18:33.980
I've played the hell out of those Japanese mixes.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.560
You know, for me, this is controller,

18:36.560 --> 18:38.880
good new controller plus best hits

18:38.880 --> 18:39.720
is what this game is to me.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.680
Yeah, that really is how I feel about it.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.180
But the good thing about it is that

18:43.180 --> 18:46.200
now I can have friends pick up, you know,

18:46.200 --> 18:47.700
who are like, oh, that's neat,

18:47.700 --> 18:49.240
but be so intimidated by it.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.500
They've got access now to one

18:50.500 --> 18:51.840
that's gonna work on their PlayStations,

18:51.840 --> 18:53.160
they can practice at home,

18:53.160 --> 18:56.120
and then come over and play the imports with me.

18:56.120 --> 18:59.240
And it's gotten me back into the money

18:59.240 --> 19:02.400
because having a new DDR arcade mix

19:02.400 --> 19:04.280
is all fine and dandy and everything,

19:04.280 --> 19:06.320
but I've got a new Beatmania in my house

19:06.320 --> 19:08.360
that I've been playing the hell out of.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.380
And as I went hunting the other day

19:10.380 --> 19:11.760
to try to find my copy of 8th Style

19:11.760 --> 19:13.880
and I'm actually considering going and buying 10th.

19:13.880 --> 19:14.720
Awesome.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.600
Well, let's leave it at that.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.440
That sums it up.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.540
Okay, more games.

19:17.540 --> 19:18.740
Good thing it's a slow news week

19:18.740 --> 19:20.160
because I've got a lot of games to talk about.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.340
Kingdom Hearts 2.

19:21.340 --> 19:22.620
I

19:22.620 --> 19:28.320
Didn't like Kingdom Hearts 1. You know why I didn't like Kingdom Hearts 1 when we ship the camera the gummy ship

19:28.460 --> 19:34.860
It's it's like Kingdom Hearts 1 was such a phenomenal idea and I but this is the weird thing. I'd love the story

19:34.860 --> 19:41.880
I love the music. I love the cinema. I love everything about Kingdom Hearts except playing the game

19:42.060 --> 19:44.060
That's my problem

19:44.180 --> 19:50.860
Kingdom Hearts 2 it's all fixed. It is all fixed the camera not a problem for me anymore

19:50.860 --> 19:58.080
more. Minimap, there now to help my, you know, 3D confused butt get through the levels. It's

19:58.080 --> 20:03.400
phenomenal. Kingdom Hearts 2 is phenomenal. I cannot, I can't describe how incredible

20:03.400 --> 20:07.920
I think this game is. I have not been sucked into a game this much, I don't think since

20:07.920 --> 20:11.720
the Super Nintendo game. I have literally been playing with every spare moment I have

20:11.720 --> 20:13.440
this week, I've been playing Kingdom Hearts 2.

20:13.440 --> 20:17.080
I have noticed that Roxas doesn't annoy me as much in English as he does in Japanese.

20:17.080 --> 20:21.120
I think what's great about it, and I know a lot of people have been bitching about that

20:21.120 --> 20:24.200
three-hour prologue, I don't want to give any spoilers, but there's like a three-hour

20:24.200 --> 20:27.720
prologue essentially, you have to play this game for three hours, three hours, fifteen

20:27.720 --> 20:32.200
minutes until you see the title screen, the nice thing about it is for those of us that

20:32.200 --> 20:36.120
didn't really play it the whole way through, Kingdom Hearts 1, it really does explain it

20:36.120 --> 20:40.800
in a not cheesy manner, like it's kind of, I don't want to, I'm trying to do it without

20:40.800 --> 20:41.800
spoilers, it tells it through flashbacks essentially.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.800
It also ties in with Chains of Memories, that's the whole point.

20:43.800 --> 20:48.260
Right, because Chains of Memories was more event- well, I knew actually quite a number of people who played it.

20:48.260 --> 20:48.760
Uh-huh.

20:48.760 --> 20:56.220
Um, I'm actually- my plan is to go back and play Chains of Memories, I just haven't had time to, but it's- it's a complete story.

20:56.220 --> 20:58.700
I like that it sort of brings you back into it.

20:58.700 --> 21:04.520
I mean, if you're not gonna play Kingdom Hearts 1, you're playing Kingdom Hearts, you just read the spoiler fact for Chains of Memories, read the spoiler fact for Kingdom Hearts,

21:04.520 --> 21:08.320
and at least that way it'll kinda catch you up with the story, and then you can enjoy the game.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.860
You've seen the ending of Kingdom Hearts, right?

21:09.860 --> 21:22.160
I have seen the ending of Kingdom Hearts, because it's funny because the way I was introduced to Kingdom Hearts is I dated someone a long time ago who was really, really into it, and I kind of saw everything, you know, I got shown all of that, so, I don't know.

21:22.160 --> 21:28.860
Did, um, did you see the final movie from, I did send you the final movie from the Deep Dive, didn't I?

21:29.860 --> 21:38.560
Which was, with the international version in Japan, after Kingdom Hearts came out, they labeled it the Deep Dive, it had, like, the Sephiroth battle in it.

21:38.560 --> 21:42.380
okay and on it had this extra movie file which part of it plays in the

21:42.380 --> 21:45.520
prologue where with the

21:45.520 --> 21:48.700
the nameless people at the end

21:48.700 --> 21:51.860
okay so I'll show that to you later

21:51.860 --> 21:54.900
but no I really recommend for people before you play

21:54.900 --> 21:58.460
Kingdom Hearts 2 go back and get that movie off a deep dive because it really

21:58.460 --> 21:59.060
does

21:59.060 --> 22:02.860
tie in a lot more too familiarize yourself just even the slightest bit

22:02.860 --> 22:05.000
with the Kingdom Hearts 1 story and I think you'll be okay

22:05.000 --> 22:08.540
but yeah the game itself is is fantastic it's so

22:08.540 --> 22:13.040
it's so deep there's so much to it like you know I love the

22:13.040 --> 22:17.640
drive and the limits and I just fought this one battle not that long ago I was

22:17.640 --> 22:18.100
doing

22:18.100 --> 22:21.960
it's the Beauty and the Beast level and though the final battle you do and I

22:21.960 --> 22:24.860
don't give away too much but the final battle you do in there is in the ballroom

22:24.860 --> 22:28.620
but you're doing things like you using the chandelier to attack the monster and

22:28.620 --> 22:29.340
stuff and it's just

22:29.340 --> 22:33.980
it is I haven't been like that like whoa like at an RPG

22:33.980 --> 22:37.200
since like I first saw a summon in Final Fantasy 7. Well I heard

22:37.200 --> 22:40.440
like, what is it, the new system that they have where it's like this

22:40.440 --> 22:45.160
action system where you hit the triangle button, depending on certain things that are going on,

22:45.160 --> 22:49.320
it'll do kind of like the God of War, you know, where you'll do like a kind of

22:49.320 --> 22:50.720
cinematic attacks and stuff.

22:50.720 --> 22:54.120
Those are really impressive in the game.

22:54.120 --> 22:57.200
Now, Kingdom Hearts does have a few things that are kind of,

22:57.200 --> 23:01.080
you know, okay, here's the thing. If you don't like, like,

23:01.080 --> 23:05.160
long cutscenes and a little bit of action in between,

23:05.160 --> 23:10.880
That might bug you about Kingdom Hearts because it is a lot a lot of cutscenes that go on for a long time and sometimes

23:10.880 --> 23:14.200
The battles in between are very short. So that might kind of annoy you a little bit

23:14.880 --> 23:22.160
The other thing some of the portrayal of some of the characters really kind of didn't sit well with me like cipher in this game

23:22.160 --> 23:27.840
I mean not that I'm a big Final Fantasy 8 fan, but no cipher was not cool and set sir

23:27.840 --> 23:32.760
I was so excited when I heard that set sir was gonna be in this game, but he was kind of dorky

23:32.760 --> 23:35.080
I didn't like Setzer in this game at all.

23:35.080 --> 23:39.880
VV, however, was badass, and there's a part, again, I don't want to spoil it, but there's

23:39.880 --> 23:43.280
a part where there's multiple VVs, and it's really cool.

23:43.280 --> 23:48.280
So the whole game is made up of these little fanboy things, and if you watch Disney movies

23:48.280 --> 23:51.800
at all, and I don't watch a lot of Disney movies, I've seen most of the big ones, or

23:51.800 --> 23:54.720
if you play the Final Fantasy games at all, there's so many things in there to just make

23:54.720 --> 23:56.920
you go, ee, ee, ee, you know?

23:56.920 --> 24:01.500
So I highly recommend Kingdom Hearts II, although I think there's going to be some folks out

24:01.500 --> 24:04.820
there listening to this going I know I wouldn't like Kingdom Hearts I don't

24:04.820 --> 24:08.420
really like those action RPGs fine you probably won't like any more there's

24:08.420 --> 24:12.300
nothing about this game that's really gonna win you over but I just think for

24:12.300 --> 24:15.020
those that are into these types of games it's so in-depth there's so much to do

24:15.020 --> 24:19.300
you probably already have your copy honestly so what else have I played this

24:19.300 --> 24:23.900
week I didn't end that there's more I played I borrowed a need for speed

24:23.900 --> 24:29.540
underground or most wanted underground ever that game is on Xbox 360 okay this

24:29.540 --> 24:32.780
This is the weird thing about Most Wanted on 360.

24:32.780 --> 24:35.080
It's like the showgirls of video games to me.

24:35.080 --> 24:38.100
It's so bad, I can't stop playing it.

24:38.100 --> 24:43.300
Now you see what I was dealing with for, what, three months at my house?

24:43.300 --> 24:45.540
There is seriously nothing to like about that game.

24:45.540 --> 24:53.340
The cutscenes are stupid, and washed out, and the graphics are crap compared to Ridge

24:53.340 --> 24:57.020
Racer and even Full Auto and some of the other games I've played.

24:57.020 --> 25:00.220
There is really not a lot to like about this game.

25:00.220 --> 25:02.260
I can't stop playing it.

25:02.260 --> 25:05.840
Until I got Kingdom Hearts, I could not stop playing that game.

25:05.840 --> 25:06.840
I don't know what it is.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.600
Now to play Devil's advocate here.

25:09.600 --> 25:13.080
The cutscenes, they're done and it's supposed to be like that.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.080
The washed out.

25:14.080 --> 25:17.240
Because it's supposed to be kind of like comic book-ish.

25:17.240 --> 25:20.220
And I thought the cutscenes were actually pretty cool.

25:20.220 --> 25:22.160
There were too many of them, granted.

25:22.160 --> 25:27.320
The graphics weren't that bad, but they weren't much better than the Xbox version.

25:27.320 --> 25:31.600
And I don't know, I'd never really gotten the need for speed, but I thought the game

25:31.600 --> 25:32.800
was okay looking.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.840
I liked the whole Fast and the Furious thing.

25:34.840 --> 25:38.320
I thought you could totally tell it was an upgraded Xbox game, but you could totally

25:38.320 --> 25:39.320
tell.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.320
Okay, that is true.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.500
You could totally tell that.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.600
Here's the funny thing I have to laugh about.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.120
You know how the cutscenes are done this?

25:45.120 --> 25:48.160
Well you know that game coming out, Ace Combat Zero, the Belkan War?

25:48.160 --> 25:51.560
Imagine that style of cutscenes with Top Gun.

25:51.560 --> 25:56.240
basically but the game is cool so I don't know I don't know why I can't stop

25:56.240 --> 26:01.700
playing I haven't played any of my racing games on Xbox 360 nearly as much

26:01.700 --> 26:06.560
as I played and it's weird because like rich racer is obviously a superior game

26:06.560 --> 26:10.580
yet I keep playing this one I don't know why I'll just have to take it back and

26:10.580 --> 26:15.660
let you borrow it no no no you're not taking no you can take it until I beat

26:15.660 --> 26:18.860
Kingdom Hearts all right let's let's go to chat room because I'm sure chat room

26:18.860 --> 26:22.100
some stuff they want to say on these games. Legend of Zaku, Kingdom Hearts 2

26:22.100 --> 26:26.260
equals makes fanboys cream in their pants. You know what though? There's

26:26.260 --> 26:30.660
things here that not just for fanboys. I think there's a lot that's... I placed a

26:30.660 --> 26:34.780
revival in the chat room. Did you? Yeah, Kingdom Hearts 2 is fangirl fodder.

26:34.780 --> 26:40.660
It's both. So much fangirl fodder. It's both. Let's see, also in the chat room, Rini

26:40.660 --> 26:46.460
says, VV is the friggin win. Absolutely, but I haven't gotten to the Tron level

26:46.460 --> 26:50.780
yet so let I'm not I'm gonna hold back on the friggin win I it better not let

26:50.780 --> 26:54.140
me down Tron level better not let me down I've seen the Tron level it won't

26:54.140 --> 26:58.040
let you down thank is a tree get to play light cycles yes you get freakin light

26:58.040 --> 27:03.780
cycles but the light cycle part actually is not as cool Wow but you do get light

27:03.780 --> 27:09.420
cycles that is great no you're talking about all the the

27:09.420 --> 27:13.220
yaoi DJ poo eater in the chat room which by the way is one of my favorite

27:13.220 --> 27:17.480
DJ Pooh Eater in chat says, nothing wrong with the fanboys, nope, nothing at all.

27:17.480 --> 27:19.660
You know what, everybody's fanboy about something.

27:19.660 --> 27:25.660
For some people it's football, basketball, for some people it's crocheting, for some

27:25.660 --> 27:26.660
people it's Kingdom Hearts.

27:26.660 --> 27:30.780
You know they were saying that they're going to announce at E3 this year that they're continuing

27:30.780 --> 27:36.540
the Kingdom Hearts series but in a different way, something, definitely it's something

27:36.540 --> 27:41.260
they're going to keep making games, but they're thinking about expanding it in different ways,

27:41.260 --> 27:44.020
maybe not like Chains of Memories but

27:44.020 --> 27:45.860
god I'm hoping... You know what?

27:45.860 --> 27:48.620
Do you know what we were theorizing when we were playing Kingdom Hearts outside? Some of the

27:48.620 --> 27:50.560
boys were over, we were talking about it.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.460
Here's the thing.

27:51.460 --> 27:54.580
They say they want to do something different with Kingdom Hearts.

27:54.580 --> 27:59.060
Square Enix says they're working on a new MMO.

27:59.060 --> 28:02.780
Would Kingdom Hearts not make the coolest MMO? You know that would totally get me back

28:02.780 --> 28:03.760
to play online.

28:03.760 --> 28:07.200
I don't think that's going to be what happens because, one,

28:07.200 --> 28:11.180
uh... they're working on something else, not that for

28:11.180 --> 28:15.660
an MMO cuz I've I remember hearing about it like last year I know I heard that

28:15.660 --> 28:18.980
they're doing something else but I mean it's just my brain couldn't help but go

28:18.980 --> 28:22.880
there it's like oh it's just something about that seems oh so right can you

28:22.880 --> 28:26.860
imagine like and the MMO could be updated with new Disney and square look

28:26.860 --> 28:33.060
I see them doing an anime series or no ABC I rather see yeah I actually I'm

28:33.060 --> 28:36.220
very surprised they haven't already did you know there's actually Kingdom Hearts

28:36.220 --> 28:40.920
manga they could do a CG like anime because this game I mean basically

28:40.920 --> 28:46.160
cel-shaded CG anyways and it looks really good I mean it looks very

28:46.160 --> 28:49.640
realistic to you know true to the animated series that they're pulling

28:49.640 --> 28:54.840
from but um oh my god it would make one hell of a kick-ass movie it would be one

28:54.840 --> 28:58.880
franchise Disney would you know rock with because it appeals to everybody

28:58.880 --> 29:01.780
that's what's kind of cool about the game too because if you know most people

29:01.780 --> 29:05.620
that haven't played it they're like oh cool King you know Disney characters you

29:05.620 --> 29:08.940
you know, let their kids play it and then it's actually got a really good storyline

29:08.940 --> 29:09.940
to go with it.

29:09.940 --> 29:13.620
You know what's funny is the girl at Toys R Us was so obviously new when I bought the

29:13.620 --> 29:16.580
game and she was like, what's the big deal about this game?

29:16.580 --> 29:22.020
A bunch of people have been coming in here today and I'm like, imagine Disney but like

29:22.020 --> 29:28.700
with a more mature storyline to it and you get to interact with it and be in it.

29:28.700 --> 29:32.100
That's the great thing about this game and she was kind of like, hmm, sounds interesting,

29:32.100 --> 29:35.260
know but it's kind of interesting to try and explain Kingdom Hearts and I'm

29:35.260 --> 29:41.980
thinking well you get to interact with Winnie the Pooh and Mulan I can't the

29:41.980 --> 29:46.060
games are a lot more hardcore than that I know I know it's it's but it's so hard

29:46.060 --> 29:52.700
to explain okay let's see more comments from chat room more more more dirty thief

29:52.700 --> 29:58.620
theorizes Kingdom Hearts 3 could be a theatrical sequel for the movies for GS

29:58.620 --> 30:03.660
S191 says, I would be okay with a Kingdom Hearts MMO, but do a damn true sequel to Super

30:03.660 --> 30:05.660
Mario RPG first.

30:05.660 --> 30:07.580
Seriously, definitely.

30:07.580 --> 30:08.820
This is what we need.

30:08.820 --> 30:10.500
Screw this Paper Mario crap.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.700
I am done with Paper Mario.

30:12.700 --> 30:16.580
I want a goddamn Super Mario RPG 2.

30:16.580 --> 30:18.220
Just remake the whole damn thing.

30:18.220 --> 30:23.740
Dirty Thief in our chatroom says, everyone's going to be a Keyblade holder if you do a

30:23.740 --> 30:25.580
Kingdom Hearts MMO.

30:25.580 --> 30:26.580
Not necessarily true.

30:26.580 --> 30:30.780
like you notice how in Kingdom Hearts 1 and in this one there's always these

30:30.780 --> 30:34.680
like gangs of kids that hang out together I think there's something you

30:34.680 --> 30:37.620
could do with that and not necessarily everybody has to be a Keyblade holder it

30:37.620 --> 30:41.100
could be like you know it could be all about adventuring together with friends

30:41.100 --> 30:44.500
because that's how I noticed Kingdom Hearts 1 what I did play if you know

30:44.500 --> 30:47.980
hearts 1 2 kind of both open up with that same theme adventuring with your

30:47.980 --> 30:52.500
friends and that's like a big theme through the games too so I think it

30:52.500 --> 30:57.500
would be a perfect MMO but what do I know I don't design them Tiger Claw says

30:57.500 --> 31:02.180
hey how about a Super Mario MMO huh dirty thief says he has a way to

31:02.180 --> 31:08.420
explain Kingdom Hearts you like Disney you like Final Fantasy play it well said

31:08.420 --> 31:14.460
alright let's get into tonight's news we actually do have some news first off a

31:14.460 --> 31:19.820
disclaimer ok April Fools was yesterday and I hate April Fools day April Fools

31:19.820 --> 31:23.560
What happened to April Fools being a day instead of a month?

31:23.560 --> 31:27.880
April Fools is actually against my religion, so I don't really practice April Fools.

31:27.880 --> 31:30.100
You'll notice on Orange Lawn's radio we did no April Fools gag.

31:30.100 --> 31:33.380
There will be no gag in tonight's program, I'm sorry.

31:33.380 --> 31:38.140
We did a gag last year, but it was stupid and obvious, and we thought about doing them

31:38.140 --> 31:41.220
this year, but then we realized, or at least I was realizing...

31:41.220 --> 31:44.020
We're just too lazy and procrastinating too much.

31:44.020 --> 31:48.380
In the time it takes to set up an April Fools prank, I could be doing something more constructive

31:48.380 --> 31:49.700
for the website in the long term.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.700
I like the one we did on DDR Freak.

31:51.700 --> 31:55.700
The one where all the text was translated into gibberish for a day or whatever?

31:55.700 --> 31:58.700
We changed it into Rot13.

31:58.700 --> 32:03.700
Honestly, I have to admit, as it's been with the past three years of the DDR Freak April Fools prank,

32:03.700 --> 32:07.700
I click, I go to the site, I roll my eyes, I go somewhere else.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.700
That's been my April Fools visits.

32:09.700 --> 32:12.700
I was laxing my moderator duties yesterday.

32:12.700 --> 32:13.700
Everybody was.

32:13.700 --> 32:16.700
To be honest, I think the Blizzard ones have been the best.

32:16.700 --> 32:17.700
Blizzard has had some good ones.

32:17.700 --> 32:22.460
Panda Express or Pandaren Express whatever it was in their game. Did you see this one?

32:22.460 --> 32:28.060
The new alliance class is the WISP. No, not the WISP. It was, what was it, Burger Craft.

32:28.060 --> 32:32.700
Oh yeah. Their new fast food cheat that they're gonna. That was hilarious. I think that's

32:32.700 --> 32:38.420
great. What were some other great April Fools pranks played out there on the internet? Game

32:38.420 --> 32:45.220
Facts telling you not to cheat. Actually, my favorite one, another site that I moderate

32:45.220 --> 32:51.580
on as gorillas unofficial and that was actually my favorite prank and I I knew

32:51.580 --> 32:54.360
it was a prank when I saw it and I went and I went to the sources and hey was

32:54.360 --> 32:59.460
this prank yeah it is but don't tell anyone so um they posted a perfectly

32:59.460 --> 33:04.740
photoshopped article well written for a music match magazine which doesn't

33:04.740 --> 33:09.060
really exist in the UK uh-huh saying that uh for anyone who keeps up with the

33:09.060 --> 33:13.300
whole gorillas fandom saying that Paula was rejoining gorillas and that noodle

33:13.300 --> 33:16.900
was out of the picture for a while and I was like oh yeah and I loved I just

33:16.900 --> 33:20.660
loved watching everybody going oh my god oh my god oh my god and I'm sitting

33:20.660 --> 33:24.780
there going haha you know what's funny is I read about that on the Wikipedia

33:24.780 --> 33:28.260
like Wikipedia had a giant list of every April Fools prank on the internet

33:28.260 --> 33:33.120
yesterday and that was on there was girls an official prank I loved slash

33:33.120 --> 33:40.020
dots prank they turned the site pink and was like you know my little pony just

33:40.020 --> 33:45.380
nerdy stuff that was cute I actually nobody got my prank because people I

33:45.380 --> 33:49.640
guess believed it and didn't comment on it I know I knew it was a prank the one

33:49.640 --> 33:55.420
in your LJ I said that I was leaving my job next month to be a like a writer for

33:55.420 --> 33:58.980
a holistic magazine and you know what my reaction was to that I went I read it I

33:58.980 --> 34:02.780
rolled my eyes and went to the next story I didn't even read it from two

34:02.780 --> 34:07.060
years ago which was when I said I was moving to Washington because you'd

34:07.060 --> 34:08.340
threatened to do it before.

34:08.340 --> 34:13.820
Because Dan's been wanting to move us to Washington now for like the past five years.

34:13.820 --> 34:17.060
The very first episode of this program you said something about moving to Washington

34:17.060 --> 34:18.060
and that hasn't happened yet.

34:18.060 --> 34:20.060
You can't go, you have this show, you can't go.

34:20.060 --> 34:22.420
But I can do a spinoff in Washington.

34:22.420 --> 34:27.060
A spinoff would be called It's Raining Here.

34:27.060 --> 34:29.320
It's Raining Rain.

34:29.320 --> 34:33.340
We should though bring up our announcement.

34:33.340 --> 34:34.340
Oh yeah good.

34:34.340 --> 34:35.340
We have an announcement.

34:35.340 --> 34:36.340
This is not a fool's print.

34:36.340 --> 34:44.660
real honest to God or whoever you believe in announcement we are doing two

34:44.660 --> 34:50.020
panels at Fauna May this year in San Jose I'll be getting dates and

34:50.020 --> 34:53.220
everything we'll be putting it up on our website Memorial Day weekend right it is

34:53.220 --> 34:57.700
Memorial Day weekend last weekend in May mm-hmm we will be there with two panels

34:57.700 --> 35:02.860
one for sure is on podcasting we'll be doing full-on presentations I will be

35:02.860 --> 35:08.020
cosplaying I might too I I have some ideas on what I want to do I am actually

35:08.020 --> 35:13.020
I am actually taking a suggestion by one of our longtime listeners DJ run mass and

35:13.020 --> 35:16.960
I am cosplaying tamari from Naruto like everybody else in the universe freaking

35:16.960 --> 35:20.380
cosplays Naruto I want I have an idea for cosplay I'll tell you off here I

35:20.380 --> 35:23.860
think it's easy and I think it's cute and we could all do it but then I had

35:23.860 --> 35:29.580
another idea because I know him who came over gave us resident evil stars air

35:29.580 --> 35:31.400
or soft guns with laser sights.

35:31.400 --> 35:33.280
Dan and I have been shooting each other all day.

35:33.280 --> 35:34.860
It's been fantastic.

35:34.860 --> 35:37.520
So I'm sort of thinking about reviving the Jill costume,

35:37.520 --> 35:38.520
but I'm not sure.

35:38.520 --> 35:39.200
Awesome.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.720
OK, we're about like 40 minutes into the show.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.160
We haven't even gotten to the first story yet,

35:42.160 --> 35:43.080
so we have a game movie.

35:43.080 --> 35:43.800
Video games?

35:43.800 --> 35:44.600
What the hell?

35:44.600 --> 35:45.600
Fonami's going to be happy with it.

35:45.600 --> 35:46.480
So we're doing podcasting and what?

35:46.480 --> 35:47.820
The other one is just gaming?

35:47.820 --> 35:48.320
Gaming.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.440
E3 wrap up or something?

35:49.440 --> 35:49.920
Yeah.

35:49.920 --> 35:50.880
I don't know, something like that.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.560
Yeah, it will be right after E3, so yeah, that'll be.

35:53.560 --> 35:54.800
OK, so check that out.

35:54.800 --> 35:55.560
It'll be awesome.

35:55.560 --> 35:56.240
We'll be there.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.000
We'll probably be giving stuff out, too,

35:58.000 --> 36:02.800
We will be doing, I know for sure that our panel, one of them is on Saturday, I'll be

36:02.800 --> 36:05.600
getting official time as soon as they're given to me by my contact.

36:05.600 --> 36:06.600
Sweet.

36:06.600 --> 36:07.600
We'll post all that info on the website.

36:07.600 --> 36:11.640
Thank you to Fonomay for inviting us and letting us ruin your con.

36:11.640 --> 36:16.560
No, no, no, no, Rob is Manfay.

36:16.560 --> 36:17.560
Manfay's been done.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.920
What, is that something in the chat room there?

36:19.920 --> 36:23.040
23 Magus brought that up.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.040
I'm not gonna be Manfay.

36:24.040 --> 36:29.680
Are there any cosplayers, Man-Fei is this guy who's not very attractive, cosplaying

36:29.680 --> 36:31.320
Fei from Cowboy Bebop.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.320
Okay.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.320
Yeah, it doesn't work.

36:33.320 --> 36:37.360
Look, Rama's offering to send me the Black Mage costume I wore at Katsu-Khan.

36:37.360 --> 36:41.260
Here's the thing, if you listen to the first 30 minutes of the show, you know where my

36:41.260 --> 36:43.860
fanboyism is right now.

36:43.860 --> 36:48.760
So fill in the blanks, you can guess what I probably have planned for the cast of OLR.

36:48.760 --> 36:49.760
You're great.

36:49.760 --> 36:53.160
Alright, nope, that's, yep, you're gonna be the duck.

36:53.160 --> 36:56.720
I'm kidding. That's not it. That's not it. I'll tell you later. All right

36:59.120 --> 37:03.920
Everybody thought this was a joke, but one up calm is saying no, this is not a joke

37:03.920 --> 37:08.080
This was not our April Fool's prank this we are picking this up from legit sources

37:08.080 --> 37:13.320
And that is Final Fantasy 13 is going to be a surprise at maze e3

37:13.320 --> 37:19.160
There's going to be a brief teaser video and confirmation from the publisher that the RPG will be a PlayStation 3

37:19.160 --> 37:24.160
exclusive and of course now one up published this on March 30th of 06

37:24.160 --> 37:28.240
people were saying it was an early April Fool's joke but one up and in fact even

37:28.240 --> 37:33.120
Square Enix came out and said don't forget that people like to play April

37:33.120 --> 37:36.280
Fool's pranks around this time of year but one up published another story that

37:36.280 --> 37:41.780
said no your Square Enix is trying to deflect we we have inside sources says

37:41.780 --> 37:48.560
this is gonna happen and that was followed up by Game Informer really I'm

37:48.560 --> 37:58.560
While there have been numerous rumors about Final Fantasy XIII, Square Enix has never released any information about the title.

37:58.560 --> 38:05.560
The recent online article stating that the title will be exclusive for PS3 and Shona A3 is not based on any official information obtained by us.

38:05.560 --> 38:08.800
I hope the readers will remember April Fool's Day is tomorrow

38:08.800 --> 38:13.600
and may print and many print and online outlets pull pranks every year

38:13.600 --> 38:18.920
before they get their hopes up or before they get their hopes crushed by a joke.

38:18.920 --> 38:23.800
So still rumor. And 1up.com ran a follow-up story that said

38:23.800 --> 38:27.480
nope Square Enix is just trying to deflect we we have inside sources says

38:27.480 --> 38:28.520
this is the real deal.

38:28.520 --> 38:34.520
Now I think logically we all know Final Fantasy 13 is going to happen on

38:34.520 --> 38:40.280
PlayStation 3 because let's see you had 7 8 9 on PlayStation 10 11 12 on

38:40.280 --> 38:45.840
PlayStation 2 13 14 15 on PlayStation 3 seems pretty logical we also had the

38:45.840 --> 38:49.840
first three on the NES and the second three on the SNES exactly right they've

38:49.840 --> 38:54.960
always 3 3 3 okay the only big shock was that they moved from Nintendo to Sony

38:54.960 --> 38:59.520
but that's years old news and the crap that comes out on the stupid you know

38:59.520 --> 39:02.960
and 10-2, I'm not even counting any of that.

39:02.960 --> 39:06.440
Not counting any of that. It's inevitable we're getting Final Fantasy 13 on

39:06.440 --> 39:07.640
PlayStation 3.

39:07.640 --> 39:10.760
It would be hard to talk me out of that notion.

39:10.760 --> 39:15.560
Well, here's what the problem is. The surprise is, 12's not even out on shelves over here yet,

39:15.560 --> 39:17.840
so to announce 13 seems a little...

39:17.840 --> 39:21.720
Well, here's what I don't like. I don't like people ruining surprises like this, for one, because, yeah,

39:21.720 --> 39:24.840
of course they're always gonna have something that they're surprising everybody with. Hell, we

39:24.840 --> 39:28.920
probably know stuff that we can surprise people with, you know, that I haven't heard about yet, but

39:28.920 --> 39:32.320
Obviously, you can't say anything about it until E3, so...

39:32.320 --> 39:36.040
Yeah. Well, we'll see. Of course,

39:36.040 --> 39:40.040
there's nothing else to be said about this game so far, just that E3, they're

39:40.040 --> 39:44.120
gonna show it. That it will come out before Final Fantasy 12 will in the United States.

39:44.120 --> 39:47.480
You know what, though? It makes sense, because what else is Square gonna show

39:47.480 --> 39:48.160
this year?

39:48.160 --> 39:52.440
They just released Kingdom Hearts. I don't think 11 has any life left in it,

39:52.440 --> 39:55.860
and their expansion is coming out. I think it'll be the last one.

39:55.860 --> 40:00.840
Treasures of Aht-Ur-Gon. Sorry, I'm gonna get hate mail. All that crap that they showed

40:00.840 --> 40:06.200
last year that never came out. I don't wanna get hate mail from the Final Fantasy 11 fans.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.360
I'm just saying I think this next expansion is the last one. I don't see them doing another

40:09.360 --> 40:12.520
one after this, because they've done three expansions now. Because Rise of the Zillert

40:12.520 --> 40:17.120
technically was an expansion, we just got it for free here in the US. I bet one more

40:17.120 --> 40:22.140
will be coming out and that's about it. I think a new MMO will replace it. That's just

40:22.140 --> 40:23.140
That's my thoughts.

40:23.140 --> 40:24.140
Alright, anyway.

40:24.140 --> 40:28.300
Now, I know some buddies of mine were in town this weekend and one thing they did today

40:28.300 --> 40:31.060
was go shopping for an Xbox 360.

40:31.060 --> 40:32.660
And why would today be the day for that, Loki?

40:32.660 --> 40:36.860
Today would be the day because everyone has been hoarding them up because all those increased

40:36.860 --> 40:42.940
shipments, you know, Best Buy and Target and stores like such were doing their, I guess,

40:42.940 --> 40:45.220
third launch of the system.

40:45.220 --> 40:51.680
Best Buy's had 60 systems per store and I think it was similar over at Target and whatnot.

40:51.680 --> 40:57.120
they're out there you can find him now finally so I one of our and he'll be

40:57.120 --> 41:00.480
here for part B he ran out for a little bit they went somewhere but Miklotov

41:00.480 --> 41:05.440
was in town this weekend he went to Best Buy this morning he they're crazy they

41:05.440 --> 41:08.960
drove by it like 3 a.m. to make sure there wasn't gonna be a line and then

41:08.960 --> 41:13.000
they came back went to bed and went like right before it open and sure enough he

41:13.000 --> 41:17.200
got there and got a premium system and he said they had 80 in stock they still

41:17.200 --> 41:20.720
have some there right now he called a little bit ago because I think he wanted

41:20.720 --> 41:23.380
to take it back because he was afraid of something was wrong with it I don't know

41:23.380 --> 41:27.560
I haven't been following the whole thing I'll grill him in part B but um yeah

41:27.560 --> 41:31.280
they apparently still have a bunch in stock and it's not just best by doing

41:31.280 --> 41:35.200
this there's GameStop was gonna release a bunch today as well GameStop had some

41:35.200 --> 41:40.180
EB and I think I think somebody else was doing this too. I overheard GameStop earlier this week

41:40.180 --> 41:46.560
when I picked up Far Cry that they were gonna be having more in so that's great

41:46.560 --> 41:49.920
I mean that's great because now we'll see some better games come out because

41:49.920 --> 41:53.180
Because some of the publishers have been pushing back their games because they're afraid there's

41:53.180 --> 41:55.680
not many units out there that sell their games.

41:55.680 --> 42:00.040
So that's why the whole Splinter Cell double agent got pushed back this September.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.480
Does this mean the shortage is over of Xbox 360s?

42:02.480 --> 42:03.480
This is it?

42:03.480 --> 42:04.480
The end?

42:04.480 --> 42:05.480
It's getting better.

42:05.480 --> 42:06.480
Let me put it that way.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.480
Okay.

42:07.480 --> 42:08.480
I know our company is selling them in May.

42:08.480 --> 42:12.040
We're going to have them for sure in May in all of our warehouses.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.560
So I get them like $5 cheaper than retail.

42:14.560 --> 42:18.560
I'm just asking, will we declare the shortage officially over now?

42:18.560 --> 42:22.820
When 80 Xbox 360s are sitting there in Best Buy and there's still some on the shelf halfway

42:22.820 --> 42:24.940
through the day, does that mean the shortage is over?

42:24.940 --> 42:29.980
I would say, well think about it this way, they're going to be getting maybe about half

42:29.980 --> 42:34.660
that next week, so they're going to start getting them regularly on the shelves, so

42:34.660 --> 42:37.900
if you don't have one yet now you can probably get one.

42:37.900 --> 42:41.580
And it's a good time too because you're starting to get, the games are starting to slow down

42:41.580 --> 42:46.620
a little bit, it's kind of dip in the year, and there's plenty of good titles out right

42:46.620 --> 42:51.460
now. March was a great month, so go for it.

42:51.460 --> 42:56.500
We're going to move on here, keep it moving. Now take this with a grain of salt as you

42:56.500 --> 43:01.580
should every story tonight because somebody could be playing an April Fools prank on us.

43:01.580 --> 43:04.160
This is one I've kind of seen going back and forth a little bit because I think I saw another

43:04.160 --> 43:08.900
story dispute this, but there was a story floating around the internet this week where

43:08.900 --> 43:16.180
Iwata over at Nintendo is saying that the simultaneous global revolution launch is not

43:16.180 --> 43:21.200
gonna be likely quote we don't think it's necessary to do the simultaneous

43:21.200 --> 43:26.520
worldwide launch simply because others are doing this you and you know Sony of

43:26.520 --> 43:29.080
course is doing this big thing where they're gonna do a worldwide launch and

43:29.080 --> 43:30.840
they're supposed to be region free and all that stuff

43:30.840 --> 43:36.680
Nintendo saying I mean we don't need to do the same thing so could that mean

43:36.680 --> 43:40.000
that the revolution comes out in Japan this year and we still have to wait I

43:40.000 --> 43:43.320
hope not I think it's gonna be out in both markets for the end of the year are

43:43.320 --> 43:44.980
Are we talking two week difference?

43:44.980 --> 43:46.300
Month difference?

43:46.300 --> 43:47.140
Who knows?

43:48.240 --> 43:50.060
I think they'll launch it worldwide

43:50.060 --> 43:53.380
if they have the units to do it.

43:53.380 --> 43:55.100
I mean, because why not?

43:55.100 --> 43:58.260
But if they don't, big deal.

43:58.260 --> 44:00.180
I think the unfortunate thing is that

44:00.180 --> 44:04.700
some of the countries are probably gonna get the shaft

44:04.700 --> 44:05.940
that usually tend to get the shaft

44:05.940 --> 44:07.660
when it comes to these launches,

44:07.660 --> 44:09.620
like Australia, sorry guys.

44:09.620 --> 44:12.020
You know, some of those other countries

44:12.020 --> 44:17.260
that aren't the U.S., Japan, and Europe, and even Europe gets the shaft half the time,

44:17.260 --> 44:20.540
probably aren't going to see this at the same time, which is, you know, too bad.

44:20.540 --> 44:22.060
It's unfortunate.

44:22.060 --> 44:25.340
We'll see, we'll see.

44:25.340 --> 44:28.420
Alright,

44:28.420 --> 44:31.940
let's go over to Loki, who has another follow-up story there on the Revolution.

44:31.940 --> 44:36.140
Yeah, of course, you know, kind of tying in with the whole Revolution being cheaper

44:36.140 --> 44:37.060
than the

44:37.060 --> 44:38.480
competition out there,

44:38.480 --> 44:57.480
The Revolution first party games are going to be seeing a price tag of basically $50 or less, which, you know, is good and all, but I don't think it's too impressive because if you look at, you know, the first party 360 games, those are also $50, so I don't know.

44:57.480 --> 45:14.480
Hopefully that will kind of start the trend of games being a little bit cheaper, but since, you know, obviously the development costs are going to be less than, you know, developing for the 360 and the PlayStation 3, I could definitely see them having, you know, cheaper games.

45:14.480 --> 45:19.480
Yeah, I mean it would be kind of stupid to release the least expensive system and then the most expensive games

45:19.640 --> 45:25.880
So I think this kind of makes sense if you know and Nintendo's I think trying to affirm that yes

45:25.880 --> 45:28.680
we're gonna be the cheapest system when this thing releases and

45:29.640 --> 45:35.200
You know, I think their games have to match that is that the games have to stay competitive. So but you're right

45:35.200 --> 45:41.920
I mean, it's not that competitive if they'd come out and said no game under 40 or even $30 now, that would be whoa

45:41.920 --> 45:49.440
I'll be something else. In not so much console gaming news but going on to a

45:49.440 --> 45:53.160
certainly big gaming event that's happening this month right around Dark

45:53.160 --> 45:58.360
Sakura's birthday. Yes. We have the Silent Hill movie coming out right? Yes there's

45:58.360 --> 46:02.920
actually a little bit of talk from Roger Avery who is the author of the

46:02.920 --> 46:08.880
screenplay for the Silent Hill movie. He has basically tried to give his

46:08.880 --> 46:13.300
assurance says that it will be very much based around the actual games which a

46:13.300 --> 46:19.040
lot of us who've been looking into this have heard him say already but he did

46:19.040 --> 46:24.680
speak to a reporter in Hollywood recently and is quoted saying Christoph

46:24.680 --> 46:30.160
Christoph Ganz and I knew how passionate the video game fans are for Silent Hill

46:30.160 --> 46:33.840
at the minimum we didn't want to piss them off we want to make this movie for

46:33.840 --> 46:41.580
them he also mentioned that it isn't always that way the with video game

46:41.580 --> 46:46.760
tie-ins another quote from him says Hollywood executives are very quick to

46:46.760 --> 46:50.980
throw out the source material of the game doom kills me this was one of the

46:50.980 --> 46:54.280
movies I wanted to do so badly I met with them early on and I looked at the

46:54.280 --> 46:59.880
original script and asked them where's the doom in this well the doom in this

46:59.880 --> 47:04.280
will be the box don't you remember the first-person shooter part well at any

47:04.280 --> 47:10.560
rate I do also have a UK release date for the movie it will be out on April

47:10.560 --> 47:15.560
25th well that's not much of a delay not much of a delay at all ours is the 21st

47:15.560 --> 47:21.600
oh that's that's nothing for standard movie delays so awesome you know I've

47:21.600 --> 47:25.200
said this on the show before I'll say it again I think when we were lucky enough

47:25.200 --> 47:29.640
to go to Konami gamers day a few months ago to have a Kiriyama Oka sitting next

47:29.640 --> 47:36.540
two, Christophe Gans, introducing the trailer together, saying, we are bringing this to

47:36.540 --> 47:39.900
you, and Kiryamoka, of course, being the producer of the last two Silent Hill games and doing

47:39.900 --> 47:43.660
all the music for all of them, and Christophe Gans being the director, I think that spoke

47:43.660 --> 47:48.000
volumes right there, that they're working together, they're presenting this together,

47:48.000 --> 47:51.660
and I don't think you ever saw that happen with previous games, you know, sure, maybe

47:51.660 --> 47:55.140
they say nice things about each other before the movie came out, and then after the movie

47:55.140 --> 47:58.180
comes out, they all distance themselves from each other and blame each other for the movie

47:58.180 --> 47:59.180
sucking.

47:59.180 --> 48:03.500
like explain you know the different differences between obviously this

48:03.500 --> 48:07.820
movie is based on the first and third games and I like how they explain the

48:07.820 --> 48:11.820
differences between why the main character is a female instead of male and

48:11.820 --> 48:16.180
stuff like that and it made a lot of sense and it's not like oh well we did

48:16.180 --> 48:20.300
this because uh we get this actress or you know we did this because we wanted

48:20.300 --> 48:25.820
explosions or you know something stupid so I definitely am confident that this

48:25.820 --> 48:31.420
will finally be a Sean Bean movie you get the sense that this movie is a

48:31.420 --> 48:37.620
little more Japanese than any other game movie we've gotten yet the trailer is

48:37.620 --> 48:42.460
like freaking totally Silent Hill I mean I can't see it as anything but it's sort

48:42.460 --> 48:45.940
of like Silent Hill alternate universe you know what's the problem is now is

48:45.940 --> 48:48.860
that the bar is so high for this movie that it better rock or we're gonna come

48:48.860 --> 48:51.940
in on the show that next week and trash it and pick every little thing that's

48:51.940 --> 48:57.260
wrong with it don't let us down guys all right then again we might be a little

48:57.260 --> 49:02.820
bit more mellow since it'll be the day after that's true I'll be hungover

49:02.820 --> 49:08.140
Loki you have a follow-up relating to Silent Hill yes of course a tie-in with

49:08.140 --> 49:11.980
the movie release Konami's announced a few things of course he previously

49:11.980 --> 49:16.940
announced Silent Hill experience that one's actually has a date now it's gonna

49:16.940 --> 49:23.900
to be coming out, well maybe a little bit after the movie, on May 28th.

49:23.900 --> 49:29.340
Which is actually, if I remember correctly, the same day as the Metal Gear Solid Digital

49:29.340 --> 49:30.340
Comic.

49:30.340 --> 49:32.180
Which, same week there.

49:32.180 --> 49:33.300
So that's kind of cool.

49:33.300 --> 49:38.580
And that's basically a bunch of digital comics, some music, and some backstory to some of

49:38.580 --> 49:39.580
the Silent Hill games.

49:39.580 --> 49:42.740
Kind of tying it all together nicely for the PSP.

49:42.740 --> 49:47.420
And then, of course, also announced is the Silent Hill collection for the Playstation

49:47.420 --> 49:54.060
2, which is including games 2 through 4, and that's slated for April 13th, about a week

49:54.060 --> 49:56.900
or so before the movie.

49:56.900 --> 50:00.020
You know what we need is the Game Boy one.

50:00.020 --> 50:01.780
I keep forgetting about that one.

50:01.780 --> 50:03.060
Because we never got it over here.

50:03.060 --> 50:05.580
Or maybe it would be a bonus or something.

50:05.580 --> 50:07.520
Could be like a bonus unlockable, who knows.

50:07.520 --> 50:11.380
I don't know. I haven't actually found the translation of it

50:11.380 --> 50:14.080
outside of FAQ format.

50:14.080 --> 50:17.560
I've been hunting. Speaking of movies, you know I got invited to go see Stay Alive this

50:17.560 --> 50:18.320
weekend.

50:18.320 --> 50:21.720
I'm sorry. I turned it down.

50:21.720 --> 50:25.000
Yeah, I know I do the show on video games and stuff, but I just really

50:25.000 --> 50:26.520
don't want to see it.

50:26.520 --> 50:29.720
Even though somebody gave it a not so bad review. Didn't we get a not so bad review in the

50:29.720 --> 50:30.600
mailbag last week?

50:30.600 --> 50:34.920
I still just... I'll wait for Netflix. It's not something I can make myself go see.

50:34.920 --> 50:40.920
Alright, somebody was mentioning it in chatroom right now, so I just wanted to drop that.

50:40.920 --> 50:45.700
Moving on to other gaming news, Mario Brothers DS, you know, it was announced a little while

50:45.700 --> 50:50.920
ago and they keep pushing it back, well guess what, got pushed back one more time, May 21st

50:50.920 --> 50:53.760
over on the game's homepage is when they say this game's coming out.

50:53.760 --> 50:57.360
Now that's not too bad of a delay because it was only a week.

50:57.360 --> 51:03.660
However, now people are theorizing that, hmm, could this be because the DS Lite is being

51:03.660 --> 51:07.200
positioned somewhere around here because of course Super Mario is probably going

51:07.200 --> 51:12.540
to be the next big DS game after this Tetris Metroid combo we got so maybe the

51:12.540 --> 51:16.500
light is being positioned to be launched at the same time. That would be a good

51:16.500 --> 51:20.420
packing game with the DS Lite. A very good packing game for the DS Lite so

51:20.420 --> 51:23.760
maybe this is why the repositioning is happening. Of course we won't know the

51:23.760 --> 51:27.780
answers until E3 which is kind of a running theme across most of our stories

51:27.780 --> 51:32.340
over the next couple months. Everything will be... it's like one of those movies

51:32.340 --> 51:36.380
They're one of those games with a really contorted plot everything is explained at the end

51:37.420 --> 51:41.100
Everything will be explained at e3 and if it's not explained we're gonna be pissed

51:41.100 --> 51:41.620
Oh, yeah

51:41.620 --> 51:46.900
I forgot to mention and I was reminded by illusion here the other thing they announced was they're doing a Silent Hill

51:47.220 --> 51:52.860
Game for the PSP not the Silent Hill experience on top of that. That's right there. I had read that too

51:52.860 --> 51:54.860
They're gonna be do like a whole new game on the PSP

51:54.900 --> 51:57.660
The rumor is that supposed to be a remake of the first one

51:57.660 --> 52:01.100
I don't know maybe you remake of the first one with the characters from the movie

52:01.100 --> 52:06.580
I've been actually hearing about a possibility of them doing the movie version of the game

52:06.860 --> 52:10.340
Which is ironic because I did that as my homework in illustrator

52:11.020 --> 52:14.660
Did and you also posted a recent homework thing to our forums, huh?

52:14.660 --> 52:18.620
Like a little scary little thing that made me jump out of my chair when I clicked on it because that's right

52:20.300 --> 52:25.980
In the chat room I did for my flash homework we were supposed to animate a banner

52:25.980 --> 52:30.700
so what I did is not a banner but animate an ad so I took the Silent Hill

52:30.700 --> 52:37.440
movie poster and made it pulse in like a dark dried blood color and with this

52:37.440 --> 52:40.680
rain effect over it and when you click it the picture turns red and it plays

52:40.680 --> 52:43.500
part of the Silent Hill theme and pulls up the website so when you start working

52:43.500 --> 52:49.340
on a new website I'm actually gonna be doing a splash for us um within the next

52:49.340 --> 52:52.780
couple of months because my spring break is actually next month very cool you

52:52.780 --> 52:55.780
know I'm excited to hear Silent Hill's coming to the PSP because I think that's

52:55.780 --> 52:59.420
That's one of those franchises you can't really do on the DS as well as you can on the PSP.

52:59.420 --> 53:03.460
I think the PSP's technology with the movies and everything, I think it'll lend itself

53:03.460 --> 53:08.140
a lot better to the Silent Hill franchise than the DS would.

53:08.140 --> 53:11.940
That's me tossing the PSP fans that say I rip on the PSP too much.

53:11.940 --> 53:13.100
That's me tossing you guys a bone there.

53:13.100 --> 53:16.380
I think Silent Hill will kick butt and I don't think they could do it on the DS as well.

53:16.380 --> 53:17.780
We don't rip on the PSP fans.

53:17.780 --> 53:20.780
We have a whole page dedicated to the PSP.

53:20.780 --> 53:21.780
That's true.

53:21.780 --> 53:22.780
I know.

53:22.780 --> 53:23.780
A whole website.

53:23.780 --> 53:31.180
weeks ago they were getting vicious. Alright, anyway, now the 360 has kind of gotten a cold

53:31.180 --> 53:36.260
shoulder in Japan. People kind of don't care. But what's Microsoft going to do to try and

53:36.260 --> 53:41.320
make people care? They're going to do over. Can we get a do over? They're going to relaunch

53:41.320 --> 53:48.900
the 360. Mulligan in Japan on, well the rumor date right now is June 29th. It's supposed

53:48.900 --> 53:54.500
coincide with many of the new games coming out, especially one of my favorites, Chrome

53:54.500 --> 53:59.820
Hounds is going to be coming around that time. But some better games will be out by then.

53:59.820 --> 54:04.900
I don't see how you can actually do over a launch. You can't just pretend it doesn't

54:04.900 --> 54:08.900
happen. I mean, it's like, what are you going to do? Put more systems out there and go,

54:08.900 --> 54:15.620
hey look, we're here still. Well, I've heard of CDs being relaunched, like when there's

54:15.620 --> 54:19.180
a really popular song on the CD that gets in like a movie or something, then they'll

54:19.180 --> 54:23.820
re-release the CD, but they'll call the CD by the name of the song that was in the movie

54:23.820 --> 54:27.260
and give it new artwork, maybe that's what they'll do with the Xbox, it'll be like, it'll

54:27.260 --> 54:33.420
come in a prettier box, and it'll be like, Xbox 360 International Edition, now with,

54:33.420 --> 54:37.740
I don't know, free stickers or something, I don't know, new faceplate, I don't know.

54:37.740 --> 54:43.700
Super Japanese Happy Console! Play all your favorite games! I, I, I don't know. I don't

54:43.700 --> 54:50.780
think so I don't think it'll be that bad we'll see what happens 60 I choose you

54:50.780 --> 54:54.240
all right since we're traveling abroad right now

54:54.240 --> 54:57.260
dark Sakura likes to travel the world from her computer and tell us what's

54:57.260 --> 55:01.200
going on in the UK for our buddies over there overseas what's up I am so

55:01.200 --> 55:06.360
friggin international um there's been an update to the world of Warcraft

55:06.360 --> 55:12.120
downloader um basically we've had a bunch of players saying a blizzard uh

55:12.120 --> 55:23.920
no so they actually did a change with a patch oh 1.10 that's meaning to the

55:23.920 --> 55:29.600
downloader will run constantly even if the program is closed oh so there's a

55:29.600 --> 55:37.600
There's a quote on here from one of the World of Warcraft players from the forums.

55:37.600 --> 55:42.100
So I was playing Wednesday morning after installing the 1.0 patch and in the middle of playing

55:42.100 --> 55:46.600
my firewall says the Blizzard Downloader is still trying to make an outgoing connection.

55:46.600 --> 55:49.600
Yeah, stealing bandwidth, not good.

55:49.600 --> 55:50.600
Interesting.

55:50.600 --> 55:53.600
Now I heard about the new patch, I mean that was a worldwide thing of course.

55:53.600 --> 55:58.600
But of course, you know, things that happened in the UK and picked up over there often happen over here.

55:58.600 --> 56:02.180
um... but uh... i didn't know about that that's interesting basically they're

56:02.180 --> 56:04.840
doing that they're taking the bit torrent method

56:04.840 --> 56:07.360
right at the end they've done that before but

56:07.360 --> 56:10.080
they didn't run in the background that sounds like the difference there it was

56:10.080 --> 56:11.840
it what you knew when it was running

56:11.840 --> 56:14.080
as interesting well basically when you're done downloading the patch the

56:14.080 --> 56:18.380
connection is going to stay open so that you can share with everybody else

56:18.380 --> 56:20.440
you are becoming a part of

56:20.440 --> 56:21.240
the whole

56:21.240 --> 56:22.800
network

56:22.800 --> 56:24.140
uh...

56:24.140 --> 56:25.580
but

56:25.580 --> 56:29.620
you know all you're sending out is the the patch content but a lot of people

56:29.620 --> 56:34.340
were saying that you know part of the agreement is that they did they never

56:34.340 --> 56:38.820
once agreed to offer up their services to blizzard they're paying blizzard for

56:38.820 --> 56:44.500
their services instead so blizzard updated their downloader with an option

56:44.500 --> 56:48.460
that you can make it stop running in the background you can turn it off if you

56:48.460 --> 56:55.340
want to hmm interesting but yeah you know I honestly I think that it's it was

56:55.340 --> 56:59.220
a very poor practice on their part, where I understand the logic behind it.

56:59.220 --> 57:01.220
Especially with such a huge patch.

57:01.220 --> 57:02.380
It's not really...

57:02.380 --> 57:05.380
I don't recall seeing anything to that effect in the user agreement.

57:05.380 --> 57:09.300
I mean, I'll look back through it again, but I really don't believe that...

57:09.300 --> 57:14.020
And you allow your bandwidth to be used for Blizzard's own purposes.

57:14.020 --> 57:18.020
But to Blizzard's credit, they've been making a lot of mistakes this year, because I can't

57:18.020 --> 57:22.980
help but think back to the political Lee-ish issue from a few months ago.

57:22.980 --> 57:27.420
But they've been pretty good about coming up with really intelligent fixes, not always

57:27.420 --> 57:31.740
the fastest way, but at least they fixed their mistakes, unlike some companies.

57:31.740 --> 57:34.460
So I've got to hand it to them there.

57:34.460 --> 57:35.460
What else?

57:35.460 --> 57:39.860
We also have a demo for Blazing Angels on the PC.

57:39.860 --> 57:49.440
There is a 467 megabyte download available for the demo.

57:49.440 --> 57:57.100
get to train a biplane fly around Dunkirk and London shoot stuff I'll go

57:57.100 --> 58:03.320
ahead and link the the demo in the chat room but it is available at 3d gamers

58:03.320 --> 58:12.520
comm slash games blazing angels all right we also have a demo for galactic

58:12.520 --> 58:20.440
civ2 by a stardock corporation it's called a galactic civilizations 2

58:20.440 --> 58:25.320
dreadlords it's a sequel to the I guess the first one but it's set in the

58:25.320 --> 58:32.480
future where you go in you know go into space you have different factions that

58:32.480 --> 58:39.760
you choose from different available options for customization the demo for

58:39.760 --> 58:45.420
this is also up at 3d gamers if you go to 3d gamers.com slash game slash

58:45.420 --> 58:50.060
galactic civ 2 slash downloads you can find it there as well and I'll also link

58:50.060 --> 58:58.340
that the chat room cool and the last one that I have is

58:58.340 --> 59:06.220
Nintendo is offering basically their European audience a chance to air their

59:06.220 --> 59:15.240
grievances basically there was such a long delay for Animal Crossing wild

59:15.240 --> 59:24.040
world a lot of people got very upset over this in fact there was a website

59:24.040 --> 59:28.960
opened up called Nintendo of Europe watch to basically go over a lot of the

59:28.960 --> 59:32.720
problems including a Hall of Fame a Hall of Shame for good and bad release

59:32.720 --> 59:39.600
schedules there actually and there were a few games that you know they mentioned

59:39.600 --> 59:43.720
that made it over there before they made it here first like another code which I

59:43.720 --> 59:51.720
have been waiting on for a while but there are delays from days to months you

59:51.720 --> 59:55.320
know so many and even with the release schedules that I've announced there's

59:55.320 --> 59:59.160
been lots of different changes going between them I seem to recall reading

59:59.160 --> 01:00:04.760
When I checked out that site that like Wario were twisted was just coming out over there and like that game came out here

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.620
Like last year, I mean that was a horrendous delay

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:12.320
I don't know what caused that but they they they didn't get that game for like six nine months after we got it

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:18.560
That's which is too bad because it's kind of a cool game, but there's you know more interesting stuff on the DS now

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.060
But I would I would though check out that site in Nintendo of Europe watch

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:28.500
because it's a place to I mean it's basically giving people an opportunity

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:34.420
to voice their concerns over the massive changes in and even if you're in the US

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:40.060
you can see just how good you have it yeah yeah we really they've been pretty

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:44.780
much on on the level with us but then again we can go to Washington and knock

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:48.740
on their door but you know at the same time we sometimes feel like we have to

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:52.260
wait for Japan to get it then we'll get it then Europe gets it you know we're

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:57.140
We're not we're not on the top of the ladder either. No, but it of course it depends on the type of game

01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:02.460
Because of course we get some games before Japan does just it all depends on who's making it. Yep. All right, and

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:10.540
The last bit of news is release dates going over the upcoming release dates for this week

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:17.960
All these are going to be on the seventh. We have Def Jam fight for New York. Hooray

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:23.900
Iron Warriors we have Lara Croft Tomb Raider Legend, Magna Carta on PS2,

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:32.680
Painkiller Hell Wars on Xbox, Plarium Advance on a GBA, Top Spin 2, and also

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:37.560
they're coming up the following week is Auto Assault on PC Dragon Quest 8.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.560
Oh about time. Yeah that's a good one. Sims 2, Family Fun Stuff, Mega Man Battle Network 5.

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.040
Didn't Def Jam Fight for New York come out here like a year ago because I

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:52.320
remember incessantly making fun of that title. Is that on PSP? Oh. Yeah, it's PSP. Oh, nevermind.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:59.920
Nevermind. Nevermind. I stand corrected. Thank you. I also get Tomb Raider for us. Yes. Hey,

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:05.360
that's one for you. K? But it is items. Hooray, the 20 millionth Tomb Raider game. But of course

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.560
it's the first. You know, Tomb Raider 2 I actually liked for two things. One was locking the annoying

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:15.200
butler in the freezer, and, cause then he didn't follow you around anymore in the house. And the

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.400
second was hopping up on the balcony in her main room and making her jump off

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:25.760
and break her neck. You could also make her explode. There was a little button press code you

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.740
could do to make her explode. It was awesome. Eat Taco Bell? No. Loki what's

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:34.760
coming out in the U.S.? The U.S. not too much this week it's actually pretty slow

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.720
but um for the PC you've got full spectrum warrior 10 hammers only about

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:47.560
a week late, but still pretty good. Also, wow, Double Dare 3. That's pretty lame. Anyways,

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.720
um, yeah, so apparently not any- Oh, like the Nick show Double Dare? The Nickelodeon-

01:02:52.720 --> 01:03:01.480
Yeah. Wow, okay, whatever. Anyways, uh, not too much. But, um, PlayStation 2-wise, though,

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:07.260
You've got MLB 2K6, same also coming out on the Xbox this week.

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:14.060
Also you've got for the Playstation 2 Tourist Trophy, which is going to be the Gran Turismo

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.360
of motorcycles.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:22.420
And Commando Strike Force on both PC, Playstation 2 and Xbox.

01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:28.860
And finally, if you happen to be a fan of basketball games, NBA Ballers Phenom is finally

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:36.060
coming out in PlayStation 2, and also on PSP from Russia with Love and Bust-A-Move Deluxe,

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:42.380
which is pretty cool, and Cabal's Dangerous Hunts for the redneck in you.

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:46.040
I have a hard time believing Bust-A-Move Deluxe is cool because it's gonna be the same fucking

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.040
game on another system.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.040
It is the same.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.040
I mean, come on!

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.040
Come on!

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.040
How many times does that game have to come out?

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.880
Just go buy the Taito collection.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:57.300
And why did they have to steal the name of the, you know, popular dance game?

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.900
Puzzy Bobble is such a cuter name. I know. Stupids.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:06.120
Alright, now if you like to play games an awful lot you might be trying to set a

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.140
new record

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:12.440
and Loki, you know Twin Galaxies, one of these big sites that tracks records, what are they up to?

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.500
They're up to no good as usual.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:18.820
What they're doing actually, they have a couple things going on. The first is

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.700
they're actually holding a contest

01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:24.420
it's called Who's the Toughest Gun in Dodge City

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:26.460
of video games.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:33.020
And to kind of tie in with everything, there's going to be a bunch of contests being held,

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:37.860
kind of demonstrations to see who can get the highest score in like Dig Dug, Donkey

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:46.340
Kong, Gorf, Galaxian, Joust, Ms. Pac-Man, Qbert, and Zookeeper.

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:52.180
And what they're also doing is they're tying this all into the 2007 Guinness Book of World

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:58.920
records and actually that Twin Galaxies is going to be tied in with the Guinness Book

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:01.020
so all these records will be going into the Guinness Book.

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:02.140
No Burger Time?

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.140
No Burger Time.

01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:04.140
Worthless!

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:08.420
So, um, it's kind of funny though, I had to laugh because the Qbert one, they actually

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:13.660
have this one old woman that's going to be competing.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:16.300
Is that the Granny Hardcore or whatever her name is?

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:20.700
Yeah, yeah, it's one that, I can't remember her name, but yeah, I saw it in the email

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:26.300
all I got from them but it yeah so basically this older woman she held the

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:31.220
record on the show she held the record like you know years ago and finally you

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:36.660
know basically been practicing between bridge matches and stuff like that and

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:42.060
you know coming out to compete against this up-and-coming guy and I don't know

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:48.140
I think that's kind of neat but I don't know you know who I would like to

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:51.740
interview one day, is the guy who beat Pac-Man.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:55.220
Well, you can't

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:58.660
technically beat it because the game was meant to just repeat the levels over and

01:05:58.660 --> 01:05:59.680
over again until they

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.460
errored out. Yeah, right, right. And he did it on stage in Namco Japan.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:07.820
255 or something, right? Yeah. I would like to, I would like to meet

01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:11.860
that guy and have him on. Yeah, why not? Let's get some people on the show. Yeah, her name is

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:15.980
Doris. By the way, we have a follow-up in our chat room thanks to

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:20.900
GK 128 would like to point out Double Dare 3 is actually a Nancy Drew game

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:25.060
Which makes it worse. I want to I wanted Mark Summers

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:31.540
Nancy Drew books. I was little I wanted Mark Summers to have to explain, you know

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:35.140
The slime pit that he had to jump through and get really freaked out by it because he was obsessive-compulsive

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:40.860
Right. Remember we all saw the 2020 dateline whatever the hell it was. It heard that special. What does he do now?

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:47.020
What does Mark Summers do today? He's a producer. He's a host of show called unwrapped on food. Oh, I

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.700
Should know that you

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:55.380
Also was a producer. In fact, I actually saw him. What was that show where they would play these massive pranks on people?

01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:01.000
He handed camera. Well, no, it wasn't that it was another one, but he was

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:14.200
Well, they got him to host a show on there where they were destroying this guy's car

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:18.200
and I mean they really didn't destroy his car, they destroyed a duplicate of it, but

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.200
it was pretty funny.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.520
Okay, for everybody in chat room yelling out what would you do, okay, hello and welcome

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.720
to like 10 years ago, okay, that's not what he's currently doing anymore, I think the

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:36.560
the pie pod is a long gone, that's fucking sad I know that, anyway, last week big announcement

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:41.600
from Game Developers Conference that Nintendo Revolution was going to have Sega Genesis

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:46.800
and Turbo Graphics games on it, well here's the deal, Hudson is saying that, oh it gets

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:56.360
better, CD-ROM2, CD games are also going to be on the Nintendo next gen system, so Snatcher,

01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:02.920
trap it might happen my heart is happy and the way because the Dracula whatever

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:09.680
Dracula Dracula X red blood sapphire strider the one that they poured it over

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:13.680
to Super Nintendo that was crap on Super Nintendo it actually was fun as a game

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:19.040
but when you not the original no yep it's poop oh I brought it on the show

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.880
once I'm playing on the webcam remember I yes a long time ago I was back in the

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.780
three-hour live show days.

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:30.180
Well, we could get away with doing stuff like that because nobody was listening.

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:33.900
Loki, what else is going to be cool about the revolution?

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.200
Well, I don't know if this is cool.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:45.980
This is just IGN with their exclusive on what they found out as the specs on the up and

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.500
coming revolution system.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:56.760
Basically they are saying that the CPU is clocked at about 729 MHz, which in comparison

01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:06.980
is not quite twice that from the Gecko CPU in the GameCube, but pretty close.

01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:14.980
Also that the Revolution GPU's ATI Hollywood chip is going to be 243 MHz, which the GameCube

01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:17.600
GPU ran only at 162.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:24.300
all this together they said it's about as powerful as a current-gen Xbox so

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:31.700
interesting I don't know I mean I don't know I I'd have to see because specs

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:35.260
don't mean anything when it comes to games I mean you have to see what the

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:40.620
games look like you could put the uber processor of God in those machines and

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:46.220
it wouldn't matter if the games suck so it's all about the games and if that

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:49.340
That ends up being what the specs really are, Nintendo better put their games where their

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:55.180
mouth is when it's, you know, it's, we're all about the games, or what's the surprise

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:59.860
or element of surprise, what was that thing he kept saying at the game developers conference?

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.500
Games are meant to be one thing, fun, fun for everyone.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:06.940
Surprise, what was that thing, he said surprise element, displacing the scene, I don't remember

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.580
what the hell the word was.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:12.340
Disrupting, disruption, disruption, that was the word.

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.780
Disracing, where the hell was my line?

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:15.780
Disruption gaming.

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.580
I WANNA PLAY YOU AGAIN!

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.580
That's like, really?

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:25.580
That's when a little kid is bugging you wanting to play the game at the kiosk at GameStop.

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.580
I WANNA PLAY AGAIN!

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:27.580
That's disruption.

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:30.480
I can't wait, I can't wait until they get like the funniest home videos where like the

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:35.180
kids are playing the revolution system and little Billy pisses off his brother Tommy

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:39.980
and the fucking kid just backhands him with the goddamn rev mode and just you know knocks

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:41.220
the kid into a coma.

01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:42.580
That'd be great.

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:46.520
And kudos to Berchas, who was first in the chatroom to correct us there.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.660
There's a slight delay between when we say things and when the chatroom hears it, but

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:53.540
he was the first to say, or she, sorry, I don't know, Berchas says the first to say

01:10:53.540 --> 01:11:00.020
disruptive gaming was the term there used at the Game Developers Conference.

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.900
Alright, really quickly, we're going to wrap this segment up, but we have a couple quick

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:06.420
top ten stories that we're going to get to first.

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:10.660
And speaking of Japan, we were talking a couple stories in this segment about Japan, we haven't

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:14.560
talked a whole lot about what their best selling games are, but we thought tonight we'd run

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.260
over their top 10 sellers.

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:21.340
No surprise there that Final Fantasy XII is at the top of their charts.

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:25.860
In their second week, they've now sold over 2 million copies of Final Fantasy XII in Japan.

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:27.380
That's pretty awesome.

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:30.180
Also in the top 10, at number 10, Mario Kart DS.

01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:36.100
At number 9, and I apologize in advance for this horrible pronunciation, Haru Kanaru Toki

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:47.660
No Uchi, Day 3, Unmei no Meikuyu.

01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:49.420
Number 8, Brain Training for Adults.

01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:51.260
Number 7, English Training.

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:53.440
Number 6, Dynasty Warriors 5, Empires.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.360
Number 5, Brain Training 2.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:00.980
Number 4, Animal Crossing Wild World in its 18th week on the Japanese charts, 2.2 million

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:01.980
copies.

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:04.000
Number 3, Ace Combat Zero, The Belkan War.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.960
Number two, Pokemon Rangers Diamond and Pearl.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.760
And number one, of course, was Final Fantasy XII there.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:16.040
So very interesting, one, two, three, three brain training games in the top ten there.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.560
And it has not come out here.

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.480
Alright now, Loki, you have another top ten of sorts.

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:25.840
Top ten games being played on the Xbox 360 or live.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:29.840
So I'm kind of questioning the whole live bit of it when you'll find out.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.500
First one, of course, being Halo 2 at the top of the list.

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:37.180
Number two is Oblivion, which I don't understand how that would be played on Xbox Live.

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.060
Is that an April Fools joke, maybe?

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:43.820
Because either it's got to be just counting the time that you're signed in actually playing

01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:44.820
the game.

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:45.820
It must be that.

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:49.300
But in which case, this chart doesn't serve the purpose I thought it did.

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:53.700
I thought these charts were supposed to tell us what games people are playing online head

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:54.700
to head.

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.300
I don't get it, but whatever.

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.300
Or whatever.

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:58.300
Keep going.

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.540
Number three, Ghost Recon 3 Advanced Warfighter.

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:03.180
Number four, Call of Duty 2.

01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:09.540
five fight night round three number six project Gotham racing three and number

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:13.260
seven perfect dark zero which is surprising because the game sucks number

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:16.820
eight a lot of people a lot of people disagree with that statement just so

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:20.820
you know I didn't like it either but a lot of people disagree with us you know

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:25.220
what I'm going back to play the games again all the way through I will play it

01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:30.580
so you know whatever I might change my opinion later just seriously though they

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:37.140
should be able to jump. And number 8, Battlefield 2 Modern Combat, whether that be the demo

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:45.140
or the original Battlefield 2. Number 9, Dead or Alive 4, and number 10, Burnout Revenge.

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:49.360
See, I have a hard time believing Burnout Revenge is that far down on the list. When

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.380
all those games have Xbox Live Aware. It doesn't make any sense to me either. Comment from

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:57.140
Chatroom's GK128 says this is probably ranked by how many games are signed on as Live Aware.

01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:00.640
yep I agree I think that's the only way this list can be legit but and I

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.340
apologize if I'm pronouncing this name wrong

01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:07.560
Tyrico says that on oblivion you have the chat for live so you can get help for

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.500
quests and stuff

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:12.160
so I guess that's true I mean the live aware element

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.400
you can chat with your friends for instance you know what you know

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.800
your buddy Eric and Mel right yeah okay Mel just got on Xbox Live and so I was

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.520
playing Hexic

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:24.060
or what yeah Hexic I was playing that game earlier she was sending me all these

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:25.340
messages while I was playing

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:28.980
and I was sending your voice messages back. So you can do the chat things.

01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:32.260
I need to friend them, because I don't have them on my list.

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.260
I'll tell you where to get their names.

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:38.180
By the way, you can post your names if you want to maybe be our friend. We

01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:39.620
sometimes friend people randomly.

01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:43.080
I friend everybody. I'll friend long-time listeners of the show.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.900
I don't friend people that come out of the woodwork, but I friend people who are long-time listeners.

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.980
But if you annoy me, I'll delete you.

01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:53.320
It's on our forums, originslaunchradio.com and there's

01:14:53.320 --> 01:15:02.520
on the forums. Speaking of which, Jason, Jason, he told me, you know, hey, add me, I sent

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:07.580
him a friend request. Never added me. Our webmaster, Jason? Our webmaster, Jason. Shame

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:12.660
on you, Jason. Also, I want to give a shout out real quick to our MySpace, because we

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:16.520
got a comment on MySpace this week where somebody said we don't talk about the MySpace enough

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:20.460
and maybe people don't know that it's there, but yes, we have jumped the shark and gotten

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:26.660
ourselves in MySpace. MySpace, where the internet goes to die, we know, we know. However, we're

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:30.960
using it to bring you clips from episodes that you may not even be able to get anymore,

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:37.580
and this week, I actually went through, and everybody on our friends list, I left comments

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:41.700
in MySpace. Actually, I didn't get everybody, because some of your pages are really wacky,

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:44.280
and I couldn't even figure out how to add a comment. So if I couldn't figure it out

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.620
in five seconds, I didn't comment you. I'm so sorry. Send a message, and I'll look at

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:51.940
it again but we're leaving comments with people now so and that took a little

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:56.200
while but it's all good so if you want to get a comment on your myspace from

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:59.760
