487	19074	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19761	25326	And we're back here with Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 179, April the 2nd, 2006.
26447	32252	Remember, guys, we're coming off of April Fool's Day, so take everything you hear tonight with a grain of salt.
33093	39159	One thing that is the real deal, though, we have a special guest here joining us for Part B. Say hello, everybody, to OLR favorite Miklatov.
39519	39940	Hello.
40180	40620	How you doing?
41041	41581	I'm fine.
42302	44063	And Miklatov, of course, works over at Konami.
44524	44724	Yes.
44963	46903	but due to NDAs can't really tell us anything.
47043	47343	Yes.
47944	49904	Are there any good games coming out this year from Konami?
51184	51464	Yes.
51924	52304	Yes.
52764	54665	Okay, I guess that's about all we can figure out.
54945	55685	Hooray!
57025	59345	Can you tell us anything about sequels to popular franchises?
59485	59806	No.
59866	60946	Can you tell us anything about Metal Gear 4?
60986	61286	No.
61306	61906	Alright.
63426	64946	So he'll be giving us one word answers all night long.
64966	66647	He can tell you that it is coming out.
67887	68127	Sure.
68167	70027	Well, that's public information.
70047	70947	We've all seen the trailer.
71588	71868	Alright.
73308	74448	How's Beatmania?
75063	75303	DarkSakura
104577	106137	Yeah, maybe.
106717	107198	If I'm good?
108278	111618	If you eat your vegetables and clean your room and make your bed.
111718	112139	I'll try.
112899	115419	Guitar Room Man Live to PSP.
116900	125441	Our listing is being put up by several of the Japanese retailers for a PSP title called Guitar Room Man Live due out in Japan at the end of May.
126201	129842	No details out, nothing official has been said about it.
130802	132263	But the hint's there.
132943	133483	You never know.
134022	137244	I'm surprised we haven't seen a Parappa the Rapper game for PSP.
137364	138744	That's a good point as well.
138965	141226	Why drag the system sales down further?
141706	143567	Parappa's awesome, you shut up.
143607	145568	I like him jammerlammy, I don't like Parappa.
145888	157014	Do you think maybe the success of Guitar Hero is causing people to go, of course, this is Japan now, not the US, but I would assume that if this comes out in Japan, we'd luck out and get it here in the US too.
157274	159115	They need to bring out the Taiko no Tatsujin.
160017	160437	for the PSP
182978	183799	Thanks for watching!
206118	209960	Alright, so I hope that really happens.
210000	221588	I really do hope so, and also I have to say that for the message board for where we found this, I do think that whoever posted this, Filler Bunny, has the best name ever.
222648	231674	But anyway, I'm really hoping that we see it because, I mean, the one problem with that though, for anyone who played Guitar Room Man is...
232902	236025	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
259838	264721	I was getting hung up on the stupid Parapara stage with the stupid Parapara UFO.
264781	266082	Isn't that like the second stage?
266382	266663	I know.
266723	267503	I love that song.
267703	268304	It's so good.
268344	269445	It's like right at the end of it.
269805	271706	It's not as good as the Eurobeat song that's in there, though.
271726	273047	That is the Eurobeat song.
273067	273888	That's the Eurobeat song.
273908	274208	No, no, no.
274228	275128	There's another song in there.
275168	276129	No, that's the one you're thinking of.
276149	278411	No, that's the Eurobeat stage with the Parapara UFO.
278451	278931	My bad.
278971	279411	My bad.
279431	280452	Parapara Eurobeat.
280994	281875	That's such a good song.
282115	282576	I know it is.
286319	287039	That game is so good.
287600	293605	Moving on, another game that I think a lot more people are looking forward to, Loki, we might have some news on.
294225	294526	Yes.
295046	296968	There's a lot more fans of this one than Guitar of Adam.
296988	298529	I got to follow up on something we talked about.
298709	300190	Remember the Forerunner rumor?
300471	302132	It actually was in Game Informer.
302152	303213	That was that Halo thing, right?
303333	304234	Yeah, Halo 3.
304274	308377	That whole article was in Game Informer and I actually got to read it.
310137	313138	I don't know what source they're taking it from.
313498	317159	I don't think it's going to be what Halo 3 is.
317439	324160	Obviously they're going to call it Halo 3 or Halo 4 Runner or something like that, which will be Halo 3, like Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter type thing.
325200	337403	Anyways, so supposedly the word on the street is that IGN, once again their anonymous source, has found out that
337748	340310	Halo 3 is supposed to be shipping March 2007.
340810	344472	And the story is not dated April 1st?
344693	346554	No, the story came out March 30th.
346854	348635	However, it is close enough to that.
349396	352498	But it sounds about right, time-wise.
353418	354159	I guess, yeah.
354179	356180	Don't they want to save it for the holiday season?
357221	363065	I mean, it'll sell either way, but... You always pick your biggest things at the holiday season, I thought.
363185	366467	Not if they think Sony or Nintendo is plotting something around the same time frame.
368322	371763	Maybe they think that maybe that's when the PlayStation 3 is actually going to launch.
372263	372683	Who knows?
372903	373223	Who knows?
373663	373943	I don't know.
373963	376164	Yeah, I'm kind of surprised they wouldn't try to release it in time for Christmas.
376184	378624	But of course, you know, something like Halo, you don't want to screw that up.
378825	381165	Well, technically that is in time for Christmas.
381545	382605	Just really early.
384006	384706	Wrong year.
384746	385066	Wrong year.
385586	391168	Remember the rumors that Halo 3 was supposed to disrupt the Sony PlayStation 3 launch?
391368	393068	Didn't Gates say that or something?
393348	393728	I don't know.
394008	396969	I'm going to be very happy if everything's been kept under wraps.
397569	398470	Like I think it has.
399050	403194	Well, you think that this is Microsoft's big thing at E3?
403254	405296	Because they don't have a new system to show off this year.
405356	406617	Now they've got to give us a big game.
406697	407998	Or so we know.
408498	408919	Oh, that's true.
408939	411381	They could have their portable that everybody's been rumoring about.
412261	418447	I think Halo 3 is definitely going to be the thing that they kick off the focus of their announcements.
419047	419688	It's got to be.
419748	420008	I mean...
420785	421065	All right.
421205	429251	Because that's, what else are you going to do when PlayStation 3 will be like, oh, look how pretty everything is, and, you know, Nintendo's going to be, look how innovative everything is.
430452	432274	Microsoft will be like, look, we have Halo 3.
432374	433815	I mean, so.
435396	437137	And the fanboys go, yay!
437157	443642	Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention, three more games have been added to the compatibility list.
444683	445064	Oh, really?
445264	448386	Winning 11-9, so some soccer for you.
449127	449467	Black,
450784	453145	and... God damn it, I forgot the last one.
453165	453605	That's alright.
454605	461528	So, that whole, like, oh, Xbox 360's gonna be constantly updated with, you know, new backwards compat... Bullshit!
461548	463649	We got three in the past couple months.
463689	464469	Okay, yeah, sure.
466087	466968	Okay, interesting.
467468	470270	It was just in time for their third relaunch of the system.
470310	473893	So I can play Barbie, but I still can't play DDR.
474253	475074	Or Silent Hill.
475834	477916	Okay, speaking of which, you bring this up.
478136	484681	We touched on this in the first part of the show and I tried to kind of retell your experiences, but how was it at Best Buy this morning?
484761	488244	How did you come to find out that they were going to be doing this sale and all that good stuff?
489204	492527	Well, I have a relative who works at Best Buy and he informed me
493129	498671	That Best Buy was doing yet another relaunch type deal of the Xbox 360.
499131	500632	And it was very hush-hush apparently.
500952	504734	When we got there, it was only like 8.30 and nobody was there.
505374	508335	And by the time the place opened, there was about 10 people in line.
508375	510976	And they had about, I think about 90 systems.
511797	517319	And my first one was defective, kind of, in my own weird way.
517919	522701	And so, I mean, I took it back right before they closed and they still had plenty of systems, so...
523971	525372	Is the shortage over from what you saw?
526633	528715	At that Best Buy, yeah.
529056	535221	There was nobody in there today, but I assume it's getting better now, after today.
535401	535922	Well, enjoy your 360.
536923	537263	Maybe.
537383	538464	The second one that you're on now.
539044	540446	I have to see if it works still.
540726	541627	What games did you get?
542167	542488	Nothing.
542508	546291	Are you going to tell us your gamer tags so all the DDR fanboys can start adding you?
546874	548957	are you going to get Rumble Roses XX?
549098	560796	no, because I worked on that game and I know it's not a good game wow see, that's the point though here's the point though I know I can get that game for free because Konami loves our company and they send us free stuff
561511	567856	and usually the people that work with me don't like the Konami stuff because they aren't into music games and stuff.
568216	569437	And no one has a 360.
570018	576162	So I'm looking forward to getting Rumble Roses for free because I'm not buying the game.
576182	578204	I didn't play Dead or Alive 4.
578304	581086	I thought, oh, I've got to get this game because it's a really good fighting game.
581627	582347	No, I didn't like it.
583268	585790	But it looked fun because at least they're
586795	588016	Nippalicious, I don't know.
588737	596163	The good thing about Rumble Rose's XX is that it has really nice lighting and sometimes good graphics.
596724	597424	That's it.
597764	600987	I want to make the most offensive looking character to play online.
601267	605471	Miklatov, you're lying because you told me yourself the photo mode was awesome.
605791	606812	Oh yeah, photo mode.
606912	613398	If you're a dirty, dirty pervert, which I am, it is really good for you because you can take
614059	636969	really really bad pictures and share them with your friends when we were testing it I guess some reviewers in Mexico had already gotten it I don't know why Mexico has systems but like they had pictures for us to download and I swear I haven't seen things that bad in a long time wow
642742	647565	DarkSakura, any interest in taking dirty photos on Rumble Roses XX and sending them to all your friends?
648185	648726	No.
649566	652048	That sure beats seeing the spam.
652088	654750	Check out my burnout clip.
654910	658052	I so wish things had worked out so you could have gone to... Wait a second.
658072	660874	So what you're saying is you can actually spread those clips online?
661054	661334	Yeah.
661554	663155	You can download them.
663896	667718	They have this place where you can just download photos that people have uploaded.
668138	670420	And you can do whatever you want with them.
670500	672321	Now, can you download them if you don't have the game?
673032	676413	No, because it's like an option in the game.
676894	679295	Ah, damn, because we could have a totally awesome contest.
680175	683256	You know, Rubber Roses XX, Dirty Photo Contest.
683717	684957	Who can make the dirtiest photo?
684977	686678	You can also put outlines around your pictures.
686738	691940	So when we were testing it, we had two of the chicks really close to each other, and we put a heart around it.
692000	693821	It was pretty funny and cute.
694681	696162	But that game is worthless.
696582	698643	It's so confusing and not fun.
700464	701004	Interesting.
703331	704172	Like the actual game.
704552	704912	All right.
705312	706113	Let's move on.
706373	707593	Talk about some other news.
707954	710835	Do you guys remember the whole Flowers for Jack?
711015	711736	That was like weeks ago.
711756	712736	We actually gave money to that.
713057	716639	Well, now it turned into this whole other thing that Pixelante is now what they're calling themselves.
716939	718540	Well, they're selling shirts now.
718780	721301	And Game Politics ran a story on this earlier in the week.
722062	723343	They are selling their T-shirts.
723463	729266	They are able to be purchased now on Zazzle, which I think is a competitor to Cafe E-Press or whatever that is.
729605	730886	So Zazzle sells this now.
730906	734449	You can see it at Zazzle.com slash Pixelanti Charity.
735010	736331	And the shirts are around $15.
737192	737872	But here's the part.
738453	750523	For every sociopath with a mouse, as Jack Thompson calls it, for everyone that buys one of these shirts, Game Politics is going to donate all the profits to the Get Well Gamers Foundation.
750823	751604	Just to rub it.
751992	753973	Jack Thompson's head on a donkey and making a jackass shirt.
781001	784444	because actually he couldn't say it was harassment because it's legal under parity.
785986	786686	I don't know.
788508	791210	All right, let's go over now to DarkSakura.
791731	796235	DarkSakura likes to surf the interweb, and she combs it up and down.
796515	797436	Day in, day out.
797476	806064	And she finds at work, and she finds that one website special enough to share with you kids in a little segment we call DarkSakura's Website of the Week, correct?
806304	806464	Yes.
810458	819785	Today's website of the week is Kingdom Hearts Ultimania, which is one of my absolute favorite Kingdom Hearts sites for a long, long time.
820265	826190	Not only does this place have stories on here, it has information about Final Mix, images, artwork, videos, audio.
826866	827386	You name it.
827506	829427	It has lyrics translated.
830848	835131	They have it in the Kanji, Romanji, English, everything.
835811	838252	It's really, really just an excellent site.
838292	845036	You can get there by going to www.kh2.co.uk Very, very good site.
845116	845957	Excellent forums.
846097	851500	It's just really top notch as far as it's the place to go for Kingdom Hearts information.
853040	855762	So all those fanboys and fangirls, somebody labeled it earlier?
856442	857923	I usually try not to look at it.
857943	861766	I didn't play the first game, but I read a lot of Slash thanks to my friends.
885273	890480	I've seen some very interesting Yaoi doujinshi posted a while back.
891000	891901	Very interesting stuff.
893904	895726	It was very disturbing because they're children.
896267	897949	And I was like, why am I looking at this?
898189	900372	You know what was better about the Slash than the first game?
900392	901694	It had a better camera.
905373	906474	Oh, that was a Kingdom Hearts joke.
906514	906814	I get it.
906834	907455	Yeah, it was.
907575	907895	All right.
908796	916502	Loki, speaking of trashy things, are kids able to still pick them up, those trashy, trashy games, the evil games that Jack Thompson says we play?
916742	930814	Well, the Federal Trade Commission released some results of their nationwide undercover sting operation, I guess, of electronic and video game stores.
931134	934257	They're basically checking to see if people are still
934838	937280	Selling these games to minors.
937880	940882	And, well, actually they found that it's been a decrease.
941842	955010	According to the survey here, 42% of the secret shoppers, children between the ages of 13 and 16 who attempted to buy an M-rated video game without a parent were able to make a purchase.
957051	958392	However, it says in 2003, the...
962605	966187	The percentage was 69%, so it's actually gone down quite a bit.
967268	978714	And it says now there's more stricter sales of M-rated games and only about 35% of secret shoppers were able to purchase them now.
980195	983677	I bet you 35% is still kind of a high number for this stuff, you know?
984337	986858	I just feel like we're still going to not hear the end of this.
986958	991541	There's no actual laws in place for this in most states.
992110	993671	There's no real laws for this.
993751	996692	So, I mean, it's just a recommendation.
997072	1008717	And it's all company enforced, so if 35% is down, that's actually pretty awesome that a company can enforce their will upon their employees to make sure that they check for ID and stuff like that.
1010318	1010578	Alright.
1011670	1012991	The Exception Rather Than The Rule
1038052	1044835	Universal Studios, one executive over there was quoted saying, sales are near zilch, it's another Sony bomb.
1046055	1047516	Ooh, burn.
1048316	1050557	Has anybody actually tried to watch a UMD movie?
1050577	1051217	Because it's not fun.
1051237	1051477	I did.
1051537	1052178	I did on the plane.
1052298	1053118	I did on a plane, too.
1053218	1053678	I did, too.
1053718	1057240	I tried to watch Spider-Man 2 because it came with my system and it was not fun to watch.
1057300	1058260	I watched Hellboy.
1058760	1059821	I saw Tron.
1059841	1061461	Yeah, it was fine.
1062302	1063122	Tron looked pretty hot.
1064974	1067256	They have nice, those PSPs have nice screens.
1067576	1075642	The problem is those movies are 20-something dollars, in some cases more expensive than what they are on DVD, and I can't play those on my DVD player.
1075682	1077964	And you don't get the bonus features for the most part.
1078084	1079385	That's right, and that's the problem.
1079985	1086310	So the format, it was a good idea at first, I think, but I think the problem is there's no...
1086989	1095012	If there were players that supported UMD, hell, even if they would announce that the PlayStation 3 would support the UMDs, which, what, you just pointed, what, Loki?
1095932	1105115	Actually, I thought that was one of the things they were going to announce at E3, is that there will be some sort of way to play UMD movies on TVs.
1106395	1107896	Well, it's maybe too late.
1108836	1109676	I think it's stupid.
1109696	1112937	I mean, okay, good, you can play a UMD movie on TV.
1113297	1115498	Okay, why do I have to buy a UMD movie over a DVD then?
1116854	1117114	On Occasion
1151300	1155162	My FU of the week would have to go toward Mountain Mike's Pizza.
1156502	1162785	It was very nice of my boss to buy our team pizza, and she was very thoughtful to get vegetarian pizza.
1163645	1166927	Except that I reacted to this vegetarian pizza the way that I react to meat.
1167727	1172329	My stomach hurt like I had been doing a bajillion crunches, and yet I felt very full.
1173089	1175110	I felt this way until yesterday morning.
1175990	1179732	So a big FU goes to Mountain Mike's Pizza for trying to poison me.
1181806	1182066	Loki!
1182926	1190068	My FU goes to Best Buy and the stupid person they have working in their camera department in their Citrusite store.
1191328	1192129	Guy was an idiot.
1192149	1193229	I asked him questions.
1193249	1199090	I was buying a video camera yesterday and I asked him, okay, what's the difference between this camera and this other camera?
1199291	1200271	That was newer!
1200591	1202391	Okay, well, that didn't tell me anything, you dumbass.
1202431	1203592	I can tell that by looking at it.
1204432	1204652	So...
1205109	1206010	Completely useless.
1206130	1212557	However, I did find a camera after having to drive a half an hour to the Elk Grove store, so that sucked.
1213458	1214519	That and stupid drivers.
1216262	1220304	My FU goes to male PMS because I think I've had that all weekend.
1220324	1223806	I know you can't tell during the show because I'm my peppy self, but I've had male PMS.
1223886	1225486	It sucks.
1226147	1232970	I'm not having woman issues, but you know that whole study that shows that men get that chemical imbalance that makes them all moody too once every so often?
1232990	1234831	I think I have that this weekend.
1235631	1238552	So be careful around me.
1238872	1240193	In my brain, in my head, yes.
1242674	1244555	The area between... Never mind, I'm not going to go there.
1245225	1246546	The other area is just fine.
1247766	1248386	It's my brain.
1250867	1255429	As many people throw their iPods out the car window in horror at that thought.
1256229	1257310	And they won't be missed.
1258430	1258851	Shut up.
1259391	1261332	Miklatov, do you have a nephew of the week you'd like to get?
1261372	1261732	Of course.
1263137	1272005	LightLikeLoki, MyFUGoesToTheBestBuy, Citrus Heights, for treating me like a criminal for wanting to take back my 360 today because I had issues with it.
1272725	1282694	And when we were walking my new one over to the counter so they could kind of fake ring me up to swap it out, the guy from Meteor was like, there's another person taking back their 360?
1282954	1284656	Do they not know how to work it or something?
1285176	1285997	I wanted to punch him.
1286877	1290801	And preemptive FU to Microsoft because I have a feeling this one will be broken too.
1292133	1293154	DJ Poo Eater is so winner in the chatroom.
1293174	1293934	He says, I get PMS every month.
1293994	1294735	He's a man, he's a mini.
1294775	1296276	I get PMS every month.
1296376	1297457	It's the day after my wife's PMS.
1323217	1323757	That's a joke.
1324917	1325857	Ha.
1326018	1328698	Ha.
1328798	1329138	Ha.
1329638	1332659	Wouldn't it be the same day because she's bugging him?
1333219	1337740	No, but he's so exhausted after helping her.
1337840	1338340	Forget it.
1338860	1341160	Men have no idea what PMS is like.
1341940	1345141	You have no way of knowing what PMS is like.
1345381	1346021	I don't know.
1346221	1350582	The day that you grow a uterus and it decides to... With the exception of the
1351503	1356145	You know the birds and bees part that you learned about in fourth grade and the biological element of it all.
1356705	1357265	I don't know.
1357525	1362227	Some days I get pretty grumpy and irritable.
1364168	1366669	Okay, I do know that... Ask my loved ones.
1366749	1368209	And I crave junk food, too.
1368489	1369610	I go through the whole motions.
1369710	1373631	It's short of the physical aspect of that.
1375832	1376312	Anyway, sorry.
1377673	1380654	Loki, please bring this back to games.
1380694	1380954	Don't die.
1382310	1389852	Okay, well, there's actually been a recall on the Pelican Power Brick Battery Charger.
1391272	1396313	It's basically this giant brick that you attach to your PSP that gives it more battery life.
1396814	1404375	Unfortunately, there's a little problem with it being that, well, it overheats and has actually caused fire damage.
1405796	1407756	According to the website...
1411098	1412338	might be dangerous.
1412578	1424761	According to the website powerbrickrecall.net, there has actually been 143 reports of the recalled battery charger overheating, including one report of fire damage.
1425422	1426922	No injuries have been reported.
1428042	1438685	So basically, what you need to do, and they give you some information of hotlines to call, you need to send it back, is
1439636	1441619	I don't know, there's better batteries out there, to be honest.
1442020	1444224	So, I don't know.
1446307	1447649	Anyways, yeah.
1447710	1453259	So don't buy these battery accessories, you know, for your PSP, because, to be honest, it lasts long enough as it is.
1454824	1455064	GameTap
1476861	1477781	Star Trek and Bonsai?
1496469	1499253	and presented by people that seem to actually enjoy games.
1499493	1500775	It's something unreal there.
1501135	1511928	So, GameTap, by the way, has also added, I guess, Neo Geo stuff now, because I checked out Baseball Stars, and then they also have Darkstalkers, so that means Capcom's on their way in, too.
1511948	1512309	Ooh.
1512649	1517030	and I heard some rumor they're doing a big Street Fighter thing, so I just thought I'd drop that out there.
1517571	1519151	But what's interesting, oh, they also lowered their price.
1519251	1521092	GameTap's now only, I think, $9.95 a month.
1521352	1524753	And I hate to sound like a marketing thing, because really, you know, GameTap has its issues.
1524793	1525993	They still need multiplayer.
1526273	1527754	That would really help them sell their things.
1528274	1532755	But I do think it's a really just neat concept idea, and I hope it's successful.
1533035	1536977	But a lot of people are saying it's doom and gloom, because, oh, price cut means they've got to move things.
1537037	1538677	But not necessarily.
1538817	1541438	It could be just an incentive to get more people on, you know?
1541789	1543510	Maybe $15 is a little too high.
1543570	1544351	People might go for $10.
1545192	1545532	We'll see.
1546333	1547414	All right, Loki.
1547994	1551497	One game you can play on GameTap is Tomb Raider, but the old ones.
1551597	1552658	But there's a new one coming, right?
1553018	1560244	Yeah, well, Tomb Raider Legend right now is coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and PSP in May.
1561025	1565749	Now, the only thing it isn't coming out on is the Nintendo systems.
1565909	1568231	No GameCube, no Nintendo DS.
1569051	1569532	However...
1570586	1572647	It's possibly coming out later this year for them.
1573507	1596573	And apparently, once again from IGN, they have talked to Eidos, and apparently Bill Gardner, the Eidos North America CEO and president, basically said, Laura likes Reggie, referring to Reggie over at Nintendo of America.
1596753	1598014	And basically...
1600011	1606693	You know, they're talking about it being released later on, possibly, I don't know, probably the end of the summer would be my guess.
1607894	1613716	Now, the only thing, though, this was announced kind of around April Fool's, so we don't know.
1614836	1620878	Personally, I don't think it's gonna, because the GameCube's not really a big system right now as far as releases go.
1620918	1629521	There's like maybe two a month, and the DS, well, you know, it's pretty good, but I don't see being able to port this very well over the DS, so...
1630501	1632744	I'm gonna call bullshit on this story, to be honest.
1632924	1636529	I don't think it's coming out on the GameCube or any Nintendo system anytime soon.
1637630	1638491	Well, that's my thought.
1639332	1639713	We'll see.
1641956	1643418	That's the problem with April Fool's Day.
1643458	1644659	It's like, you don't know what to believe.
1644719	1645941	But, you know, the GameCube...
1646895	1652939	Maybe the fact that a lot of people still own one and there isn't a lot of games coming out for it is an incentive to put this game out on GameCube.
1652999	1653299	I don't know.
1653739	1656221	I think it'd be a waste of money.
1656941	1665446	Well, of course, we all know one of the incentives to getting a revolution is going to be the backwards compatibility with not only Nintendo products, but Sega and TurboGrafx as well.
1665966	1668827	And we think we might know some of the games coming, possibly?
1668927	1671688	Well, there was a wish list that was posted.
1673028	1676609	Game Daily had an article up where they put up a wish list of games.
1677909	1684471	And these were some of the ones that made the list, which are actually all games that I own except for one, which is the last one on the list.
1686092	1686312	But...
1687679	1688820	BUNKS ADVENTURE, BUNKS REVENGE
1718329	1726398	Dracula X, Rondo of Blood, Splatterhouse, and Air Zonk.
1728200	1732645	Okay, so what we have to do now to follow that up is we have to make a wish list of our own.
1732926	1734868	And you know there's only one way we can do that, right?
1735943	1739807	Are we going to be including the games that were already on this list if we'd really like to see them?
1739907	1743851	I think so because those are all the really good TurboGrafx ones.
1743891	1746834	I think we need to let those on the list because I have one I want to use.
1746874	1754302	So anyway, the way we do it around here, if you've never heard it before, the way we make lists is through a little segment we call ListList.
1756411	1757031	Thank you for watching!
1780407	1781147	That's a given.
1781507	1782708	So we got to think outside the box.
1782728	1786788	So games we most want to see on the revolution besides Sonic from Sega and NEC.
1787209	1790689	So the way it works, you guys, we're going to go around and give our top three.
1790729	1793830	Myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and our guest Miklatov will give our top three.
1794230	1795250	Then the fun part comes.
1795310	1797611	We take one off of the list, each of us.
1798111	1800551	And then you guys, the chat room, get the final say.
1800591	1802572	You get two votes, so number one and number two.
1803312	1806333	and what you think should be on the wish list.
1806493	1810635	And maybe we'll send this wish list to Nintendo and Sega and NEC somehow.
1811255	1814977	We'll look in our little black book and see if we have some addresses we can send this to.
1815697	1818018	Alright, so here we go.
1818098	1819198	Who wants to start us off tonight?
1819458	1820479	DarkSakura, you want to start us off?
1820699	1820939	Sure.
1821079	1824740	Alright, what is your number three pick for Sega or NEC game you most want?
1824840	1825941	I am making a disclaimer.
1826941	1831803	Two of the games I would really like to see on there, I'm not going to list because nobody's heard of them, like Emerald Dragon and Sapphire.
1833052	1833392	Gotcha.
1833432	1835754	But I suggest people give them a try if they can.
1835915	1836155	Okay.
1836395	1840519	So my number three is Star Parodia, which also probably only a handful of people have heard of.
1841019	1851068	However, it's a shooting game featuring a flying bomber man, a flying PC engine, and, um, let's see, what was the other thing in there?
1851088	1853090	Because it was three different flying machines.
1853950	1858555	Um, oh yeah, and, uh, a, uh, super deformed Vic Viper.
1859636	1860116	So, uh,
1860635	1868339	It was this cute little game, like if you play as the PC Engine, which I always did, you could shoot out CDs and cue cards as your firepower.
1868719	1869419	It was really cute.
1869700	1870320	Alright, very cool.
1870420	1871300	Loki, what's your number three?
1871961	1876643	My number three, I would have to say Splatterhouse.
1876663	1879124	That game's fun.
1879144	1885127	You gotta love a game that kind of mocks Friday the 13th and has a guy that's main weapon is a 2x4.
1886928	1888289	Miklatov, your number three pick.
1888929	1889970	I have a disclaimer too.
1890535	1891937	All my games are really random.
1892177	1892517	Okay.
1893118	1898043	So my number three would be Panic, because that game was awesome and very scary when I was little.
1898083	1899684	It was on the Sega CD.
1900085	1901246	Oh my god!
1901666	1905470	At first I thought I'd never heard of this game, and now, oh my god, I have heard of Panic.
1905490	1912537	It's that little kid, and you push buttons and things, and you go to another room, and you get taken places, and it's scary, but I loved it.
1912718	1913639	Okay, sounds good.
1914139	1915700	DarkSakura, what's your number two pick?
1915720	1915941	Popful Mail
1936840	1938961	Actually, Working Designs brought it out in the U.S.
1939561	1941162	Really fun, cute little translation.
1941662	1944503	Very, very hard to get your hands on a copy of this now.
1945063	1947624	But it's a little side-scrolling adventure RPG.
1947904	1950125	Now, I've never heard of this game, I have to admit.
1950185	1951005	Did I spell it right there?
1951465	1951986	Popful?
1952246	1955787	P-O-P-F-U-L, and then mail as in, you got mail.
1956061	1956901	Okay, cool.
1957801	1963282	But it's such a cute little game, and I'll bring over my Sega CD one day so you can see this game.
1963302	1964202	Yeah, I'd have to see this.
1964222	1966843	But it was one of the Working Designs projects back in the day.
1967423	1971284	So you know the types of games that Working Designs brings us.
1972224	1972824	Loki, your number two.
1973704	1974444	My number two.
1974464	1978705	No, it was kind of a fun game.
1978925	1980245	Oh, Shadow Dancer.
1983186	1984846	One of the best Shinobi games.
1985305	1986446	Shadow Dancer was excellent.
1997685	1998465	Smooth Criminal.
1998705	2000966	You got to throw your hat.
2001707	2006349	My number two would be one of the greatest and most overlooked Sega CD games of all time.
2006609	2017013	And remember that this is, and we don't even know if Sega CD games are going to end up on Nintendo Revolution, but just the whole idea of seeing this on the Revolution would make me giggle in places I didn't even know I had.
2017694	2020975	Night Trap is my number two pick.
2021075	2022055	It had What's-Her-Face in it.
2022075	2022856	With Dana Plato.
2022916	2023136	Yeah.
2024957	2027659	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2051155	2051615	Road Rash Road Rash
2077942	2078883	Yeah, but not next gen.
2079003	2082745	There hasn't been anything since, like, um... There was one on PlayStation.
2083465	2087467	Yeah, the original PlayStation, maybe... There was one on 3DO.
2088247	2089448	I remember the 3DO one.
2090148	2091689	Alright, what was Road Rash all about?
2091709	2092950	I remember the name, but I don't remember the game.
2092970	2096071	Road Rash is, it's basically motorcycle racing and combat.
2096151	2100073	So you're, you know, riding motorcycles and hitting people with chains and baseball bats and stuff.
2100473	2100673	Oh!
2100734	2101814	I've seen the Final Fantasy 7.
2102014	2103295	Okay, I have played that game before.
2104252	2104952	Alright, sounds good.
2105852	2112054	Let's see, our chat room says, GK128 says, Road Rash was E3, but there was one on PS2 that was canned.
2112654	2114434	So I guess they started to do one and didn't.
2115434	2117095	Mikotov, your number one pick.
2117475	2121336	This is a game nobody will know, so it should get kicked off right away.
2121576	2122416	It's called Zoom.
2122816	2124436	It's on Genesis, you know that?
2124596	2125456	I know Zoom.
2125476	2126597	That game was so awesome.
2126637	2127697	Isn't that a puzzle game?
2127797	2128057	Yes.
2128077	2129077	That game sucked.
2129197	2130237	No, that game was sweet.
2130257	2131258	That game was awful.
2131278	2132698	It was an MTV game, wasn't it?
2132738	2132878	What?
2133218	2133979	Yes, I think it was.
2134259	2135299	No, you're thinking Zoop.
2135819	2136780	Oh, I am thinking of Zoop.
2136960	2138741	But this is also a puzzle game.
2138841	2139341	Oh, okay.
2139581	2145544	You're like this pig head thing with legs and you drew squares and you had to watch out for the scrubbing bubbles things.
2145905	2147285	Okay, that sounds kind of cool.
2147325	2148266	I was thinking of Zoop.
2148686	2149206	Yeah, Zoop.
2149246	2149846	You're thinking Zoop.
2149867	2150547	That game was awful.
2150707	2154609	No, this is like really old first generation Genesis game.
2154869	2156330	All right, so I get the last say.
2157330	2158051	Number one pick.
2158311	2160412	I was really tempted to do ToeJam & Earl.
2160472	2162693	I'm sorry, chat room, because chat room is yelling out ToeJam & Earl.
2162953	2164994	But I have to do this for the simple irony.
2165134	2175900	If you were a kid when this whole thing went down, you would know why I have to say Mortal Kombat, the Genesis version, has to be on the Nintendo Revolution.
2176280	2180222	So Nintendo finally gets some Mortal Kombat with blood in it and not sweat.
2180582	2182504	And really small characters.
2182864	2183144	Yes.
2184304	2185125	Wonder Boy in Monster Land
2213462	2215763	Alright, here's the list as it stands right now.
2215924	2229172	Star Parodia, Splatterhouse, Panic, Devil's Crush, Popful Mail, Shadow Dancer, Moonwalker, Night Trap, Dracula X, Rondo of Blood, Road Rash, Zoom, and Mortal Kombat.
2229572	2232153	Boy, this was way more random than I thought it would be.
2232574	2233194	We're weird.
2233774	2234455	Alright, but here it is.
2234495	2237076	Here's the part to get rid of the most weird stuff.
2237557	2240538	We eliminate one pick before we let the chatroom vote.
2240839	2242880	So, DarkSakura, what's coming off the list?
2244118	2244618	Night Trap.
2245699	2246519	Aw, you're no fun.
2246599	2250780	Because Dan and I tried to play through that game and it was so stupid.
2251280	2255521	But it's slumber parties and Dana Plato and zombies.
2256081	2260202	You know, if I wanted to watch stupid, I could watch the Toxic Avenger movies.
2261563	2262883	Loki, what's coming off this list?
2262943	2265224	You know, I should have put Zombies Ate My Neighbors.
2265304	2266344	Zombies Ate My Neighbors.
2267576	2268056	Super Nintendo 2
2293243	2295044	I think that would have won.
2295064	2297364	I can't believe I didn't say Bomberman either.
2297924	2300325	Yeah, nobody said Bomberman, stupids.
2300745	2302246	We've had Bomberman on Super Nintendo.
2302486	2302966	Oh, that's true.
2303926	2305547	It was completely different on Genesis, though.
2305567	2305907	That's true.
2305967	2307607	Alright, 64 is pretty fun.
2307647	2308088	Let's see.
2308248	2309168	Jamie, I want to take it off.
2309868	2312049	Okay, Matt didn't have one taken off, so I'm going to be fair.
2312129	2316430	I'm going to take off... I don't know.
2316710	2321952	I'm going to take...
2323234	2324035	Final Fantasy VII Skitchin
2338470	2341431	All right, here it is.
2341471	2343952	You guys can vote for your favorites in chat room right now.
2344072	2353956	Star Parodia, Splatterhouse, Panic, Devil's Crush, Popful Mail, Shadow Dancer, Moonwalker, and Mortal Kombat.
2354336	2360238	So send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your number one and your number two picks.
2360618	2363399	and we'll let you know at the end of the show who the winners are.
2363920	2366060	And boy did we end up weird.
2366100	2367201	That was a really weird list.
2367261	2371343	I sort of wish though now that I put Emerald Dragon on there because Emerald Dragon was such a good game.
2371363	2371583	I know.
2371623	2379726	I wish that they would say, let's bring Saturn games on because then I could say, you know, freaking Black Matrix because that game will never come out over here.
2381027	2387929	I think, though, even though our list is really random, I think that's a good thing because we're thinking of titles that a lot of people sometimes don't think of right away when they think of Sega Genesis.
2387949	2389070	I mean, everybody thinks of Sonic.
2389370	2390690	But, you know, I think this is good.
2390890	2399373	But there's also some pretty, you know, there were pretty mainstream games on there because Devil's Crush and Shadow Dancer, those were really popular.
2401974	2408736	I remember just sitting in the same room watching Dan play through Shadow Dancer and I was like, yeah, this game's awesome because you have a dog.
2409713	2411139	Yeah, that's why I couldn't take it off the list.
2411400	2411822	It's too good.
2414520	2418042	DarkSakura is the administrator of our mailbag.
2418082	2428949	And when you guys send your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, she puts on the rubber gloves, because you never know what people send us, and gets in the mailbag and pulls out some letters and reads them for us every week.
2429169	2431050	Sometimes my hands get some spam on them, too.
2431650	2436733	Yeah, if you're adding Orange Lounge Radio a spam email, just freaking stop.
2437113	2437614	It's annoying.
2438134	2439034	We'll hunt you down.
2439075	2439675	Yeah, we'll kill you.
2440335	2441316	Cheese grater, lemon juice.
2441957	2444378	DarkSakura, who's in the mailbag this week?
2446178	2460883	I have email from, well, I guess, I think this is Sakurina, I think, but didn't sign it, about DDR Supernova.
2462711	2467092	First of all, I'll just go ahead and read the email.
2467172	2468713	First things first, I played Supernova.
2468853	2469613	It was awesome.
2469673	2470393	I really enjoyed it.
2470713	2472934	The left pad was kind of sticky, but the music was awesome.
2472974	2474794	I highly recommend Seduction Vocal Mix.
2475254	2476935	But yes, it was really awesome and it looked nice.
2478255	2478955	Hooray!
2480776	2483856	The next one is from TheOtherJamie, who spells the name differently.
2484617	2486837	Remember the fun last year with the Mega Man effect?
2486977	2490258	Though it only could run on a Mac, they've ported it.
2492743	2493924	Oh, the Mega Man effect thing.
2493944	2494585	I remember that.
2494665	2495145	What's that?
2496386	2498307	When you would boot up a... Check out the MySpace.
2498327	2499728	There's a clip from the show on there.
2499788	2501069	MySpace.com.
2501089	2503171	I don't have time for MySpace.
2503211	2503631	Too bad.
2503811	2504172	There it is.
2504192	2504852	That's all I'm giving you.
2505953	2507414	Jerk.
2507554	2512398	Our dear friend Rob with two B's sent us an email about Sega Sammy.
2514319	2518702	I would also like to say Rob with two B's has a higher gamer score than anybody on my Xbox friends list.
2518982	2519883	Congratulations, my friend.
2521834	2525516	He actually posted a bit of an article in here about Sega debuting a new headquarters.
2525837	2526877	Sega Amusements, the U.S.
2526917	2532862	game factory that has emerged from the merger of Japanese game giant Sega Corp.
2532902	2544991	and the equally powerful Sammy Corporation, have held a grand opening recently for their new 77,000 square foot sales development and game and prize warehouse facility in the Chicago suburb of Elk Grove Village.
2546432	2550235	Special guests at the event included Sega Sammy Holdings CEO Hajime Satome,
2551298	2560408	who engineered the merger and oversees the combined companies in Japan as well as local dignitaries such as Mayor Craig Johnson.
2560808	2565633	The combination has dramatically enhanced the company's capabilities, said Satomi through an interpreter.
2566054	2570138	Take a look around at what we have to offer and then think about what Sega can do in the future.
2571379	2573742	So, it's...
2576022	2576582	More Sega.
2576883	2577403	What can I say?
2577443	2578984	Hopefully we'll see some good things come out of them.
2579384	2581786	I want to see more freaking Planet Harrier.
2584008	2592013	Now we also got an email from someone whose gamertag is Ldriver but E-I-I-E.
2592994	2593294	Awesome.
2593874	2594655	Like Kill Bill.
2594915	2595095	Yeah.
2595556	2595796	Love it.
2596196	2597477	So I'm going to go ahead and read this email out.
2598178	2601681	I found out about your site slash show about three weeks ago, and I've been listening ever since.
2602002	2607887	You put out great content that's not only really funny and informative, but also socially responsible and different in relation to gaming.
2608308	2612131	Not to plug another podcast, but Gamertag Radio is also another place I hear similar topics.
2612732	2623162	As a 20-something working professional adult gay gamer, or gamer myself, I was really appreciative to the segments in your past two shows about how not all gamers are straight nerdy teenage boys.
2623786	2629910	You guys also happen to be darkly sarcastic about almost everything like me, so I find myself laughing out loud while listening to your show.
2630130	2630550	Me?
2630650	2631611	Sarcastic?
2631771	2632351	Never!
2632812	2635914	In places like my subway ride to work or at my desk.
2636614	2638195	I do have one quick question for you three.
2638355	2640357	Who or what do you think will steal a show at E3?
2640477	2647421	I personally think PS3 is becoming overhyped, especially in the past few weeks, and that Microsoft and or Nintendo will use E3 to surprise everyone.
2647481	2648202	What are your thoughts?
2648562	2650363	Thanks for putting out great shows and keep up the great work.
2650592	2656395	I actually got to see the videos from the Game Developers Conference, including all the wonderful PS3 in-game shots.
2656875	2658076	Ooh, does it look nice.
2658776	2660157	I think the revolution will be awesome.
2661757	2663778	I think it's going to be information overload this year.
2663858	2666680	I think E3 is going to be so monumental in a way you've never imagined.
2666760	2668521	I don't think any one person can steal the show.
2668641	2671322	I think everybody's going to be constantly one-upping each other the whole day.
2672302	2679606	I think if anybody, I think Nintendo's got the biggest secret out there, and they stand to either really...
2681081	2681861	This is actually my first launch E3.
2681881	2684102	I don't count last year as a launch E3 because...
2705382	2705622	Boom!
2705722	2706923	And we're going to see it.
2735836	2736956	I was able to pull up that program.
2737016	2738397	Oh, the Mega Man thing?
2738417	2738977	It's pretty funny.
2739037	2739817	That's great.
2739837	2740017	Firefox.
2740037	2740157	Cute.
2765249	2766130	Oh yeah, very cute.
2766310	2770933	Yeah, you better take that off the computer before Extrovert tries to go play World of Warcraft because he's going to go, what the fuck?
2771774	2775177	Too bad you can't do the little trick where you turn the stars into chickens.
2777178	2778039	Who remembers that?
2778119	2778859	I do, I do.
2778880	2779680	That would be a cool hack.
2780080	2780761	Alright, any more email?
2781481	2783403	Yes, there is more email, so huh.
2783523	2783603	Um,
2785832	2790274	One of our listeners, Justin, has a question for us, and I'll read his letter.
2790914	2794075	I noticed that Lemmings was out for the PSP, but only in the UK.
2794135	2798957	I was wondering if the UK version will play on my US PSP, and if so, what is the best way to import this game?
2799057	2800297	Keep up the good work on the live show.
2800877	2802138	Is PSP region free?
2802178	2802638	I don't remember.
2802658	2803978	Yeah, PSP is region free.
2803998	2804439	There you go.
2804679	2805219	Import away.
2805639	2807059	Find whatever.
2807219	2810541	Make sure you check the Better Business Bureau before picking an importer.
2810941	2811421	Trust me.
2812274	2813475	Never buy anything from BuyRite.
2836670	2837651	or Toys and Joys.
2837932	2839934	Actually, Toys and Joys has given me nothing but good service.
2840074	2841736	Really?
2841796	2842157	Jerks.
2842377	2851489	I bought my guitar controllers for Guitar Freaks from them for cheaper than anywhere else had them and they had just got their shipment in and packed it up that day.
2851809	2852910	We did a phone order.
2854032	2855674	I got it within like a week.
2855894	2857275	I've not shopped at any of those stores.
2857475	2863239	I've used a place in the past called Japan Video Games because I went to their actual store once and so I've been loyal ever since.
2863419	2866200	Of course, that's where I got my drum controller from.
2866521	2869402	But now we just sort of take the drive to Burlingame and go to Network.
2870083	2871043	Isn't Network closed?
2871484	2872745	Didn't they just close recently?
2872985	2873605	I don't think so.
2873685	2875206	Because we were trying to go there the other day.
2875246	2876447	They are closed on a weird day.
2876467	2877548	I think they're closed on Tuesday.
2878048	2878148	Oh.
2878788	2879389	Anyway, we've got to go.
2879429	2879769	Okay.
2879809	2880089	Sorry.
2880970	2881110	Yeah.
2881610	2882551	Worldwide show, guys.
2882571	2883051	Yeah.
2883752	2884732	Actually, that was the last email.
2885072	2885352	Okay.
2885772	2886192	All right, then.
2886513	2887313	Send us more email.
2887353	2888053	More, more, more.
2888393	2888873	We crave it.
2889013	2889453	Mailbag.
2889553	2891273	OrangeOnTrader.com is where to send it.
2892074	2892514	All right.
2893034	2897314	We will reveal the listless winner very soon.
2897354	2899675	However, we have a couple stories real quick for you guys.
2899695	2900715	There is a small announcement, though.
2901015	2901535	Oh, what's this?
2902155	2904376	Next week, we will be rolling out a contest.
2905316	2905776	That's right.
2906276	2911117	We're not going to say anything about it, but make sure that you tell everyone to tune in next Sunday.
2911795	2917280	because also, of course, it's going to be repeated on our podcast, but the first details will be on our live show.
2917300	2919122	But we're working with somebody else to do it.
2919242	2920283	Yes, it's a big thing.
2920523	2920803	All right.
2921524	2921804	All right.
2923605	2925527	Loki, you got a story for us.
2926088	2927509	Yes, I do.
2928330	2938719	Now, anyways, before I just play with all this stuff here, basically, we have information, and it's not really much of a surprise because we knew this was going to happen, but
2940163	2946288	They're going to be announcing DOA Extreme Beach 2 at E3.
2946708	2952672	Now, I'm not sure if it's going to be volleyball this time, because I heard basketball is another rumor they're going to do.
2952712	2959698	But basically, yes, the jiggly game will be shown at E3 or announced at E3.
2959738	2961719	So, hell yeah.
2961739	2963060	Whatever.
2963140	2963621	Whatever.
2965103	2968607	The Future of Credit Cards, earning virtual currency for spending in the real world.
2983903	2985104	and Otherworld Bridging.
2985344	2986624	I'm going to make this real quick.
2986664	2987545	I'm going to sum this up.
2987865	2994489	You know how sometimes credit cards give you rewards such as frequent flyer miles and things of that sort for every dollar that you spend?
2994929	3001692	Well, now they're thinking of why not give in-game currency as a reward for spending money?
3002393	3007675	That would just screw up whatever currency, whatever economy you've got going on in that environment.
3007695	3012678	So when you use your credit card on in-game currency, you can score more in-game currency?
3013750	3014272	Essentially.
3015377	3015699	Excellent.
3017389	3018550	So, just kind of interesting there.
3018570	3019670	It's a very lengthy blog.
3019690	3021111	I'm not going to read all the details there.
3021131	3024732	If you want to check it out for yourself, check out from March 2006, there was a blog there.
3025192	3028334	But it's just now, I mean, it's an old blog, but it's just now making the rounds on the gaming blogs.
3028914	3031495	Makezine.com is the name of the site there.
3031955	3033396	And they go into a lot of details there.
3033416	3034856	But it's certainly an interesting idea.
3034936	3036437	I mean, nobody's really thought of that before.
3036597	3043100	But, I don't know, most MMO hardcore players I know that might actually sign up for something like this also hate...
3043820	3047104	GoldSellers and GilSellers or whatever the currency is in the game you're playing.
3047404	3052910	So I don't see this working because I think there's a conflict of interest there, but whatever floats your boat.
3055673	3057695	Shall we reveal the winners of tonight's list list?
3058188	3059029	Please do.
3087549	3089250	of tonight's listless.
3091191	3103899	All right, top three games we want to see on the Nintendo Revolution that is not Sonic from Sega or NEC from the TurboGrafx.
3104559	3105880	There's a lot of ties tonight.
3106500	3112504	We have in third place, we have a tie there for third place, Star Parodia and Splatterhouse tied for third place.
3113115	3114937	Good job, everybody.
3115438	3116859	Second place, we have a tie.
3117240	3121004	Shadow Dancer and Mortal Kombat tied for number two.
3121144	3121664	Good job.
3122625	3125008	But the number one game they want to see?
3126890	3127550	Moonwalker.
3127851	3128592	I win.
3128672	3129392	Hooray.
3130554	3130874	All right.
3130914	3131995	Good job, everybody.
3132015	3132656	Thanks for voting.
3133470	3135632	And we'll be sending that list to our round file.
3135712	3136552	No, just kidding.
3137093	3138774	We'll see what we can do about passing that along.
3139534	3142977	Hopefully we have some insider industry people that listen to the show.
3143457	3144338	You should email us.
3145118	3147400	We'd like to talk to you, get you on the show and interview you.
3147440	3150082	We want some new faces and things on the show.
3150302	3151583	We haven't had an interview in a while.
3151963	3156346	We've been trying to reach out to people, but everybody's like, wait till E3, wait till E3.
3156706	3157207	So whatever.
3157847	3159688	If you don't want us to wait till E3, we'll talk to you now.
3159708	3161790	All right, let's go to Skype line.
3162597	3164418	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
3164839	3165119	Hi.
3165399	3166099	Hi, who's this?
3166860	3167520	Raven's Dolphin.
3167640	3168761	Hello, Raven's Dolphin.
3168781	3169502	What's on your mind, buddy?
3170602	3172544	Uh, the UMD movies.
3173044	3173304	Yes.
3174765	3175266	What about them?
3175686	3176847	You a fan of UMD movies?
3177547	3178288	Not at all.
3178368	3179529	I'm glad they're going away.
3179729	3179989	Why?
3181170	3181470	Why?
3181610	3184552	Because I haven't bought one since that movie.
3185493	3186453	I bought one movie on it.
3186994	3187414	What was that?
3189451	3189952	Evil Dead.
3190472	3191092	That was about it.
3191192	3191733	Well, that's a good choice.
3191753	3192933	Well, you have good taste in movies.
3194254	3195935	It's all about Bruce Campbell and his chin.
3195995	3200618	I suppose if you're going to buy one UMD, you might as well buy that or Tron or Kill Bill.
3200878	3202239	Labyrinth.
3202339	3202999	Something cool.
3203219	3207221	Starring David Bowie and his... Why the hate for the UMDs then?
3207241	3208842	Were you just not impressed with Evil Dead?
3209943	3210963	No, I was impressed with it.
3211063	3215446	It's just I'm getting all my movies off BitTorrent and I'm just encoding it on my computer.
3216403	3230090	I guess that's the realistic world of what PSP has to deal with, is that, you know, the kids want to hack it and put their own movies on there, so it's a questionable legality thing there, but I guess that's what people are doing.
3230130	3235093	Well, the other thing, too, is they're also pushing these larger memory sticks, and what the hell are you going to use them for?
3235193	3236093	Obviously not pictures.
3236133	3240536	You're going to be ripping DVDs or whatever to... Downloading great podcasts like Orange Lounge Radio.
3241316	3242096	Okay, but still, though...
3243416	3244837	Every week on my PSP.
3245097	3246578	All right, I hear you.
3246598	3248459	Have you checked out olrpsp.com?
3250200	3252581	Can I plug another podcast, another site?
3253002	3254142	Oh, all right, sure.
3254943	3257904	pspdrive.com, it has your website.
3258965	3259485	I've heard of that.
3260126	3262227	I've seen our listing on pspdrive.com.
3262267	3262947	It's a good site.
3262987	3263888	I've actually used the portal.
3263908	3264468	It's a nice site.
3265449	3270732	Yeah, they have a PSP 2.0, and I just downloaded wirelessly to the PSP.
3271916	3274438	They were supporting podcasts before Sony was.
3274458	3278101	I think it's a good site.
3278141	3284545	I've seen our little teeny reduced version of our graphic on there for PSPs, which I think is really cool because somebody obviously had to take the work to do that.
3285026	3286647	I really appreciate those guys.
3286947	3289569	That's awesome.
3289689	3292931	I just want to say that I have two Windows computers just like Loki.
3293732	3296834	He's a big Windows supporter and I support Windows just like he does.
3297402	3301446	Well, it's good to hear from a Loki fan, because sometimes we get the hate mails from the Mac users.
3301486	3302066	So, alright.
3302687	3303187	Have a good one.
3304208	3304909	Thanks for calling, buddy.
3306030	3306550	Thanks, Guy.
3306730	3307251	Not a problem.
3307291	3307591	Take care.
3307611	3316459	Of course, if you don't know what we're referring to there, Loki has made comments about Macintoshes, and he's really sick of hearing about it, too, I think.
3318040	3319001	I'm... yeah.
3319021	3319101	Yeah.
3319520	3320641	I just really, I don't care.
3320721	3323624	That's what happens when people download a show that's weeks and weeks old.
3323664	3325865	Let's go over to this one.
3325965	3327807	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3328708	3329568	Hey, I'm on Lyft.
3330469	3331390	Hello, hi, who's this?
3334833	3336494	Oh, it's Ranma calling in right now.
3336514	3338456	Look, you can see the video of Ranma there.
3338916	3342539	But the problem is, Ranma, when you run in the video, it's really hard for us to hear you.
3342619	3344941	But there he is, his little Zelda hat.
3345041	3345502	That's cute.
3346519	3347219	Ramma, call back.
3347559	3348740	Turn off the video and call... Oh, there it is.
3348800	3349140	It went off.
3349700	3350280	There you go.
3350340	3350920	Much better.
3351000	3351380	Much better.
3351400	3351821	What's on your mind?
3352521	3354441	Hey, I want to cover a couple of things for you guys.
3354741	3354921	Okay.
3355342	3357522	Remember when you talked about Penn & Teller Smoke and Mirrors?
3357802	3361563	Yes, the game that was like, yeah, ran on... I'm glad you called in on this.
3361763	3362124	What's up?
3362904	3368505	It seems that when I was listening to Penn Jillette's radio, his podcast, he talked about the game.
3368886	3369266	Really?
3369646	3370106	What did he say?
3370126	3370226	Yes.
3370990	3376733	He was basically the point of Smokey Mirrors was to go after Janet Reno who hated violent video games.
3379655	3380435	That's fabulous.
3381076	3381576	That's funny.
3382436	3384197	I am posting a link in the chat room now.
3384217	3386679	If you scroll down, you'll find where you can download it.
3386739	3389920	It's called Penn & Teller's Real Life Games.
3390321	3395303	Alright, it's 923freefm.com and you can probably navigate the site from there if you're not in chat right now.
3395984	3396284	Yeah.
3396624	3396904	Alright.
3397945	3399086	Okay, what else Ranma?
3399106	3399706	What else is on your mind?
3400245	3402027	Alright, let's go back to Catscom for a bit.
3402147	3405470	Remember the awesome Zelda skit everybody was talking about?
3405550	3406511	Yes, the one I didn't see.
3407672	3409254	I'm posting a link to it right now.
3409970	3410830	Oh, you can download it.
3411290	3416472	Yeah, if you scroll that all the way down, it's called Katsu2006-link.
3416732	3421453	Okay, and that video is on the website Usagichan3.com, so check that out.
3421853	3424954	All right, post it in our forums or something so people can find that link later.
3425154	3427795	Did you guys see that Zelda fan movie that someone made?
3427975	3428935	I heard about it.
3428975	3429395	I saw that.
3429435	3430095	That was awesome.
3430155	3434596	It missed the cut for tonight's show because it's not really official, but it's interesting.
3435016	3436837	It would be interesting if they actually finish it and...
3439539	3442840	Don't you think Nintendo is going to bring down the Swift Hammer of Justice on that project?
3442860	3444140	Not necessarily, I don't know.
3444160	3446121	It's just fan stuff.
3446181	3448641	Ranchan, you need to come to Fanime with us.
3449221	3450262	Fanime 2007.
3451062	3452602	Alright, we'll be there.
3453082	3457783	If our panels go over well, tell your friends in the anime community to come to our panels.
3458483	3458883	I will.
3459664	3461124	Unlike they did at KatsuCon.
3462048	3463649	Look, you got screwed over.
3463709	3465450	Believe you me, I'm just as pissed as you are.
3465530	3467011	I had to put a dig in there somehow.
3467051	3467731	It's fine.
3467771	3468411	I learned a lot.
3468471	3468872	I learned a lot.
3468892	3471653	I did make sure to specify that our panel is on a Saturday.
3472293	3472714	Very cool.
3473174	3475555	And I met some great people at Katsugana.
3475575	3476396	That's the important thing.
3477984	3478685	That's the important thing.
3478705	3481107	And now there's a guy out there handing out flyers for us.
3481167	3481687	It's awesome.
3482007	3482728	I love our fans.
3482748	3483328	They're so great.
3483769	3486311	Ranma, I've got to let you go so we can get to more of our listeners, okay?
3486811	3487312	You take care.
3487372	3489233	Have a good one, buddy.
3489573	3490234	I just cut him off.
3490274	3490975	Sorry, didn't mean to.
3491435	3492696	All right, let's go to another call here.
3493537	3494858	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3497320	3498841	Hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
3500542	3501243	No, they're not.
3501443	3502304	Hi, who's this?
3503965	3505386	This is Xander from China.
3505746	3506827	Hi, Xander from China.
3506847	3507488	What's on your mind?
3509738	3510978	Kingdom Hearts 2 I'm like 17 hours into it right now.
3511439	3511559	Yeah?
3511579	3511619	So...
3533700	3539367	Yeah, obviously I'm liking it quite a bit because otherwise I wouldn't have bothered going through all the stupid cutscenes.
3540168	3547977	But I think that's probably one of my biggest complaints about the game is that the cutscenes are really low quality, in all honesty.
3548037	3548678	Most of them are.
3549279	3549599	Really?
3549780	3551662	I think the cutscenes have been great so far.
3552563	3553284	Well, how far are you?
3553680	3557321	The worst one for me, though, that ruined it, was the one in Mulan.
3573510	3574711	10 Heartless Chasing Him
3597919	3598980	and there's no music.
3600641	3601981	I was so pissed off.
3623279	3624319	I hate their costumes.
3625400	3628301	The part that's funny about that, though, is playing it in Japanese.
3629241	3632563	Hearing them sing Under the Sea in Japanese is just hilarious.
3633583	3636565	I can't believe it's a music game where you press one button.
3638346	3640867	Xander, any other comments on Kingdom Hearts 2?
3640907	3644288	I've got to keep it moving because we've got a lot of people trying to call in tonight, but any other comments on Kingdom Hearts 2?
3645089	3646169	I'm really enjoying it.
3646249	3648150	It's very different from the first game, so...
3648735	3653597	You know, if you didn't like the first game, you might like this one, although you wouldn't understand it if you didn't finish it.
3654577	3656418	I agree, but Miklatov's shaking his head no.
3656578	3658299	Because it still has a bad camera.
3658319	3659879	No, it's much better, much better.
3659899	3660380	It's still bad.
3660620	3663341	All you do is lock onto the target, and the camera follows it.
3663401	3663841	It's easy.
3664421	3670524	In the first game, you would lock on, and the camera would still go behind smokes and mirrors and everything, and it made it a pain in the ass, but this one's much better.
3671084	3672144	I actually disagree on that.
3672164	3672344	Really?
3672404	3674065	I think the camera's actually worse than this one.
3674485	3676346	I had less problems with the camera than this one.
3676366	3676766	Screw you people!
3678493	3687197	I'll tell you what, my favorite part so far, I know I just played this part, I don't want to give spoilers, but the boss fight in Beast's Castle was awesome.
3688437	3689078	It was awesome.
3689538	3690218	The end one?
3690418	3690658	Yes.
3691359	3692079	Don't say much more.
3692559	3693119	It was awesome.
3693960	3695440	Oh man, yeah, that was good.
3695841	3696861	Alright, that's all I can say.
3697101	3697761	Were you watching?
3697861	3698822	Yeah, I was watching.
3698842	3699822	It was okay.
3700122	3701023	It had a bad camera.
3701083	3704184	Alright, Xander, I gotta let you go before Shane pisses me off more, okay?
3704204	3705645	Okay, that's fine.
3705685	3706325	Have a good one, bye.
3707938	3708458	Alright, let's go.
3708498	3709919	I'll do one more call.
3710479	3711840	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3715201	3716122	Hello, can you hear me?
3716422	3717362	Yes, what's on your mind?
3720944	3724046	Um, I'm in a really hacky mood.
3724686	3725846	You're in a hacky mood?
3727467	3730369	Yeah, I've been hacking a lot of things recently, like physically.
3730809	3731629	Who is this, by the way?
3731669	3732530	I forgot to ask who this is.
3732570	3732950	Who is this?
3733190	3733270	Oh.
3734059	3734739	Nintendo Maniac 64
3749318	3752261	You know, I haven't even thought about doing that.
3752301	3753582	I read that on a forum this week.
3753622	3756245	Somebody just casually said putting their controller in the PC.
3756585	3757927	And I thought, that's a really good idea.
3758007	3759789	I could use that for Final Fantasy and stuff.
3760009	3760529	Does that work?
3760569	3761811	Can I just plug it in and go?
3761931	3764013	Or do I have to hack it?
3764053	3767136	You can download the drivers off of Microsoft's site.
3767336	3768697	I was asking the caller.
3768778	3770079	No, that's fine.
3770119	3771080	But those drivers suck.
3772079	3773039	I don't know, they worked fine for me.
3773359	3773779	What did you find?
3773799	3774980	There's better drivers out there.
3775220	3777520	You can get them off redcloud.com.
3777620	3778340	I'll post the link.
3778700	3779681	All right, yeah, post the link.
3779701	3785342	I'll check that out because I want to use it for Final Fantasy XI on the computer, which is ironic because I want to get Final Fantasy XI on 360.
3785402	3786002	I'm so sad.
3786502	3787842	Yes, we are sad.
3787882	3788742	Yeah, you're doing it too.
3790283	3794123	What do you find that you're using the Xbox 360 controller for on the PC?
3794183	3797164	Are you emulating games or what are you doing with it?
3798061	3803062	I do some of that, but not much because my computers are so much crap that I can't do much of that.
3804282	3809944	Like, pretty much the main thing I do is I play F-Zero Climax.
3812004	3812544	Oh, that's cool.
3813024	3813404	Very cool.
3813464	3813724	Yeah.
3814304	3814605	Alright.
3814665	3818325	Hey, I did some other hacking.
3818505	3819005	Okay, what else?
3819726	3820146	Let's see.
3821986	3826327	Oh yeah, I got my standard headset mic that I'm using right now to work with my DS.
3828224	3833507	Oh, is that why you were saying in chat earlier in the show that you really wanted to play Metroid with somebody for voice chat?
3834047	3835368	Yeah, I wanted to test it out.
3835588	3836108	Gotcha.
3836128	3838830	You know, I played my first multiplayer Metroid last night, finally.
3839410	3841291	I owned at it, I'd just like to say.
3841932	3842812	Yeah, it was when you were sleeping.
3842832	3843192	It was fun.
3843212	3843712	It was good.
3844153	3846094	You were sleeping because you had to go to Best Buy at 3 a.m.
3846114	3847555	because you were afraid there was going to be a huge line.
3847595	3847955	Yeah.
3848635	3849376	I'm stupid.
3849736	3849996	All right.
3850656	3853298	Nintendo Maniac 64, I've got to let you go because we're running really long here.
3853338	3854138	But have a good one, okay?
3854158	3854999	Okay.
3855079	3855319	All right.
3855339	3855679	Bye-bye.
3856872	3857452	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3885282	3885482	Yeah.
3886162	3888243	Well, Panzer Dragoon and Die Hard.
3888363	3889324	Okay, I've got my attention.
3899437	3923044	which for anyone who knows about this in Japan it was a Panzer Dragoon RPG but it's really hard to get your hands on however though for the Sega Ages collection there is a Panzer Dragoon collection and Die Hard which was a Dynamite DECA in Japan but however keep in mind these are Sega Ages these are meant to be cheap the Sega Ages 2900 is named 2900 for 2900 yen as in really cheap
3929471	3930372	I'm sorry, 2,500.
3930472	3930952	My apologies.
3931532	3940518	So, don't expect them to be, you know, made uber pretty, all gorgeous, everything, but they are supposed to be retouched, looking better.
3941339	3946882	And so, which would be a good thing because I really liked the Dynamite DECA series and Panzer Dragoon was really neat.
3947103	3949784	So, should be fun.
3950365	3950645	All right.
3951348	3954389	I actually did find them up for pre-order on a couple sites.
3954469	3957690	I like those Sega Ages games, unlike some people.
3958430	3961451	Well, Phantasy Star 2 was just released on the Sega Ages.
3962992	3966133	But we haven't seen any translations for these come out yet.
3967033	3967513	I guess that's true.
3967533	3970034	We've been basically playing them when we have a friend over.
3972095	3973255	But the remakes are really nice.
3973295	3979637	And of course, I have the Phantasy Zone and Space Harrier remakes, which are really, really nice.
3980789	3983150	I can vouch for these Sega Ages collections.
3983371	3987433	Quite a bit of these have been re-released.
3989034	3997918	I also like that Sega and Ages are... Not acronyms, but when you shuffle the letters around.
3997978	3999399	Antigrams, thank you.
3999459	4000400	You're welcome.
4000440	4001240	Oh, you're so smart.
4001360	4001780	I am.
4001800	4004522	Is that how you get jobs with video game companies?
4004822	4005162	Yes.
4005402	4006463	You're a smart feller.
4006892	4009213	All right, Loki, anything for us, last minute-wise?
4010013	4018456	Yeah, the first thing I was going to mention is that the cheat device for Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories is finally 1.0 now, and they added a few things.
4018836	4020596	Hover cars, which is pretty cool.
4021216	4030019	Gather spell, which causes the objects on the screen to basically hover around some fixed gravity point or something like that, and you can throw them at stuff.
4030939	4036461	They have a full-size video recorder now, and also drivable RC toys.
4037796	4038937	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4063888	4064148	All right.
4065329	4066370	Any other last-minute stories?
4066811	4067091	Anyone?
4067451	4067731	Anyone?
4068332	4068592	Anyone?
4070333	4070594	All right.
4070714	4071074	Bueller?
4071935	4076258	I don't have any really good, fuzzy last-news story of the night, so sorry to say.
4076319	4078480	So that brings us to the end of the show.
4079021	4082544	April Fool's Day kind of screwed everything up this week news-wise, so what can you do?
4083565	4083825	Anyway.
4084574	4086234	It's the end of the show, and that's no joke.
4086795	4088215	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
4088495	4091176	Miklatov, thanks for joining us, even if it was for only half the show.
4091336	4092096	You're welcome.
4092176	4093636	Have fun with your Xbox 360.
4093816	4094356	I'll try.
4094416	4097797	May you go through the same hell I went through with the groundbreaking... I can only hope.
4099518	4101038	Add me to your friends list, OMG.
4101198	4101718	I already did.
4101758	4102198	I know you did.
4102298	4103338	I'm just being stupid.
4103378	4105739	May all your camera angles be nice and joyous.
4105799	4108840	Yes, may all your camera angles not be like Kingdom Hearts, okay?
4109220	4109700	Hooray.
4109720	4110000	All right.
4110707	4111568	Loki, your final thought.
4113189	4114129	Did I let you have a final thought?
4114169	4114489	I'm sorry.
4114629	4114990	No.
4115070	4115830	What is your final thought?
4116070	4116470	Yes.
4116911	4117191	All right.
4117371	4118511	Loki, what's your final thought?
4119052	4122934	My final thought is I may be buying a laptop this week.
4125595	4127096	My final thought is buy an iBook.
4127116	4127776	You know you want one.
4127997	4128357	No, I don't.
4128477	4129757	DarkSakura, your final thought.
4131498	4133239	I'm going to have my iMac very soon.
4134440	4135401	It's two against one, Loki.
4136221	4137222	I'm not buying an iMac.
4137262	4139823	But I'm keeping my nice PC laptop.
4140705	4143426	Like I said on a previous episode, I'm bi when it comes to computers.
4143946	4144466	I use both.
4145046	4146786	And then the next one will be my Linux box.
