1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Bring on the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth.

3
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:24,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we are.

4
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,331
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the part of the show you can only hear on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

5
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:29,111
[SPEAKER_11]: It's too hot to podcast, people.

6
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:33,553
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this comment from SSJ100Matt in our chat room.

7
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:36,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Those two should have a Friday Night Nerd podcast.

8
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:38,455
[SPEAKER_11]: I think referring to Spike and DarkSakura.

9
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:40,477
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,672
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's the plan for the Silent Hill movie, yo?

11
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:11,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we've got to go see it, but what?

12
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:22,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I want to get a big, big group together on Friday because I'm having one of our listeners and a good friend come up from the Bay Area to come to the movie with us.

13
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,841
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just want to get as many people together to just nerd out the movie.

14
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:34,623
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would be cool, though, if we all had those cheese hats and repainted them to look like Pyramid Head.

15
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:36,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerd!

16
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,155
[SPEAKER_03]: That is such a good idea.

17
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:43,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I would totally do that and like carry around like, you know, a little three inch spear.

18
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,479
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's sad, though, is that I'm getting invited to a lot of these things.

19
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,860
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'll probably do Jamie's because she does have the birthday advantage.

20
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Booyah!

21
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:57,742
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, I know there's a lot of people planning on going to see this, like a lot of video game fans.

22
00:03:57,762 --> 00:04:01,363
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm very excited for how... I just hope they don't disappoint us with this movie.

23
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:02,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very excited.

24
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:07,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to do the cosplay, though, at the movie because that is fucking nerdy.

25
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,856
[SPEAKER_11]: We could put out a press release and everything in the media would be there taping us in our pyramid head hats.

26
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,437
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be great.

27
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:13,599
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

28
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a hot dog.

29
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:17,485
[SPEAKER_11]: We should call a movie theater and try to sponsor something locally.

30
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:18,207
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be awesome.

31
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:28,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm going to be putting out a massive review on our stuff.orangechallengeradio.com which has been given some attention by me lately.

32
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:32,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I actually looked at it the other day and you're the only one updating it.

33
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's going to actually see a lot of updating during E3.

34
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:45,286
[SPEAKER_05]: My personal plan is to go to the business center at E3 and do intermittent stuff updates.

35
00:04:45,706 --> 00:05:01,313
[SPEAKER_11]: and we're still trying to figure out how we're going to do podcasts unfortunately we're in a weird situation where our hotels are going to be very far apart so I'm just hoping that we can somehow do the podcast still in some way I've got shuttle from my hotel to E3 if someone can get me right back to my hotel

36
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:02,974
[SPEAKER_11]: We might be able to make that work.

37
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:03,534
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gravy.

38
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:10,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Except, now this is what my hard thing is going to be is because I'm pulled between doing DDR Freak stuff and doing Orange Lounge stuff.

39
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,560
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know.

40
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,002
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm trying to fit everything in.

41
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:15,523
[SPEAKER_11]: So if worse comes to worse.

42
00:05:15,743 --> 00:05:17,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably going to skip Roscoe's this year.

43
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:19,987
[SPEAKER_11]: You might have to contribute individual reports or something.

44
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:20,707
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll figure something out.

45
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:22,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably going to skip Roscoe's this year though.

46
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Roscoe's is overrated now.

47
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,331
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so 2004.

48
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:29,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't eat Roscoe's anymore just because I get sick off of most food now.

49
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:30,254
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

50
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:30,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

51
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:31,977
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how was your week?

52
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:34,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the bird flu.

53
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:46,062
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I worked.

54
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:50,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was my spring break when I had the bird flu, so thankfully I didn't have to go to class on Tuesday.

55
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:54,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was my flash class anyway, and I would have been dead.

56
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:56,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have been like, ugh, flash, blah.

57
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:58,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I love my flash class, but God.

58
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:06,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, though, it was pretty funny because the week before, the teacher had us review our animated ads.

59
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,149
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I did the Silent Hill one.

60
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,451
[SPEAKER_05]: And she spent like maybe two minutes on everybody else, like 15 minutes on mine.

61
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:15,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

62
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:45,814
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to figure out how to do that because I'm still a Flash newbie, but at least I've got the design part down.

63
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, congratulations.

64
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:48,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

65
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually working on a Flash design for us.

66
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:57,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm working on doing a special Orange Lounge photo gallery, but I need to take a picture of your desk.

67
00:06:58,337 --> 00:06:58,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God.

68
00:06:59,277 --> 00:06:59,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

69
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:05,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm going to use your computer as the frame for the placeholder for the images to pop up in.

70
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:05,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

71
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,081
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's going to be a month or so out.

72
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:10,482
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to require some work.

73
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:12,042
[SPEAKER_11]: With all the crap all around and everything?

74
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:15,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the crap is... I'm actually going to add in more crap in Illustrator.

75
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:15,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, goody.

76
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:21,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be the uber crappy desk, and I'm going to expand your desk by another two feet.

77
00:07:21,386 --> 00:07:22,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I wish I could really have that.

78
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:23,167
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be nice.

79
00:07:23,948 --> 00:07:26,250
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

80
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:58,801
[SPEAKER_10]: and I basically went to Golf Land drunk and went and played some mini-golf and I apparently played some Mario Kart GP which I am right now recording to my computer so we can put it on the website because I'm doing a lot of yelling.

81
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:03,704
[SPEAKER_10]: And the face that I have on the thing is hilarious.

82
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:05,565
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to see this.

83
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:07,566
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I look...

84
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:13,307
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember actually playing Mario Kart.

85
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:17,429
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish I could tell you if it was good or not, but I don't remember.

86
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:22,992
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I'm not getting married anytime soon, but I kind of want to have a bachelor party just so I can get drunk and be the center of attention for a night.

87
00:08:23,832 --> 00:08:25,533
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll go, and I'll buy you drinks.

88
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:26,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

89
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:30,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I can have an anti-bachelor party, I don't know.

90
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:34,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I was punching the screen!

91
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,215
[SPEAKER_11]: As you were, it was great.

92
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:38,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, check out that video soon.

93
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:39,696
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be up on OrangeLandrider.com.

94
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:42,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Spike, how was your week?

95
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:42,597
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your day?

96
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:49,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I threw a party Friday night, which was basically a big excuse to play Power Stone with people I don't really know.

97
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,300
[SPEAKER_11]: And I played Karaoke Revolution several times.

98
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't we sing I Got You, Babe?

99
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:55,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we did!

100
00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:56,721
[SPEAKER_11]: I do a mean share.

101
00:08:56,981 --> 00:08:57,842
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to point out.

102
00:08:58,262 --> 00:08:59,762
[SPEAKER_11]: I love doing a mean share.

103
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:00,523
[SPEAKER_11]: It was awesome.

104
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:01,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

105
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:03,244
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

106
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:04,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that it?

107
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:07,606
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just a regular party animal.

108
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:08,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

109
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:09,527
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

110
00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:12,949
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, no, I had a very game-centric week.

111
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:14,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Threw a party, played games.

112
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Played games, not at a party.

113
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,452
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the long and the short of it.

114
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:19,432
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

115
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:20,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds awesome.

116
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:22,763
[SPEAKER_11]: My week of my day was pretty good.

117
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:28,705
[SPEAKER_11]: I played a little bit of Final Fantasy XI and played other games.

118
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:31,745
[SPEAKER_11]: I had an overall pretty mellow week.

119
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:36,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Easter was today, so I went to my parents' where we had leftovers because my parents didn't feel like cooking.

120
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:44,568
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, I'm trying to think, Friday we went to that party, so that was part of the weekend there because you don't exactly live around the corner, so it's a little bit of a drive.

121
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:45,689
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's good.

122
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:46,929
[SPEAKER_11]: It was all worth it.

123
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:50,950
[SPEAKER_11]: But I was probably the only sober person there, which was kind of interesting.

124
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,770
[SPEAKER_11]: So that made me a little sad.

125
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Your share would have been a little better drunk, I think.

126
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably.

127
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,431
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have been a lot louder and probably woken up the neighbors.

128
00:09:58,471 --> 00:09:59,811
[SPEAKER_03]: But then driving home wouldn't have been fun.

129
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:04,212
[SPEAKER_03]: See, the reason I threw a party this week is because my downstairs neighbors were evicted.

130
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:05,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

131
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:07,732
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I wasn't telling anyone to shut their mouth.

132
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:09,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God, that's great.

133
00:10:09,973 --> 00:10:10,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

134
00:10:10,273 --> 00:10:12,153
[SPEAKER_11]: We should have held the party downstairs.

135
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:13,233
[SPEAKER_11]: We could have broke in.

136
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:14,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a good idea.

137
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:15,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Would have been awesome.

138
00:10:16,394 --> 00:10:16,714
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

139
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:21,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, moving on, let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

140
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:22,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Sound like a plan?

141
00:10:22,757 --> 00:10:22,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

142
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:33,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, since we have new people listening for the first time tonight, the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match is where we play three songs for you guys, a clip of last week's winner, and then two new songs for you guys.

143
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:44,203
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, you guys vote, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week music and video game program.

144
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:46,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Or I should say video game and music program.

145
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:47,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

146
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,865
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we got song number one tonight.

147
00:10:50,885 --> 00:10:53,126
[SPEAKER_11]: You only get to hear a clip of that because it won last week.

148
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:56,807
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Loki's pick, and I believe it was the X-Noise Diffusion.

149
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:57,908
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the name of the song?

150
00:10:58,308 --> 00:10:58,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

151
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:02,589
[SPEAKER_11]: So here it is, a clip of song number one, last week's winner you can vote for tonight.

152
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:10,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, you cannot place a vote until all three songs have played, and at that time I'll tell you how you vote, but you have to be in the chat room to do it.

153
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:11,912
[SPEAKER_11]: OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat.

154
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:14,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a clip of song number one, X-Noise with Diffusion.

155
00:11:20,476 --> 00:11:21,117
Thanks for watching!

156
00:12:39,096 --> 00:12:46,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that's song number one you can vote for tonight, X-Noise with Diffusion, but it has to beat two other songs, two brand new songs going into tonight's cage match.

157
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:54,841
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one is my pick, and I decided to pick a song by a group called Bittersweet, which I think is a good name for a band.

158
00:12:55,141 --> 00:13:00,683
[SPEAKER_11]: And the song's called Dirty Laundry, and I have a lot of that on the floor of my bedroom, so I think this is a very appropriate choice.

159
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:03,324
[SPEAKER_11]: And I like this because it's kind of jazzy.

160
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:05,147
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I like about this.

161
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:05,970
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's my pick.

162
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:09,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number two, Bittersweet with Dirty Laundry.

163
00:13:10,004 --> 00:13:10,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

164
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,812
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, that was song number two in tonight's case match.

165
00:16:37,092 --> 00:16:38,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Bittersweet with Dirty Laundry.

166
00:16:39,073 --> 00:16:44,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go around and see if they like that song in the studio or if they want to wash it.

167
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:45,855
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.

168
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,676
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cute and it wasn't trance.

169
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:48,236
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets a nine.

170
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:49,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

171
00:16:50,337 --> 00:16:50,897
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

172
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:51,697
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets like an eight.

173
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:52,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Spike.

174
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:56,859
[SPEAKER_03]: That flashed me back to the Sharon Apple portions of Macross Plus.

175
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Big, big bonus in my book.

176
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd definitely go with like a nine for that.

177
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:04,588
[SPEAKER_11]: That for me was music to spank someone to.

178
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:05,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Ow!

179
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:06,750
[SPEAKER_11]: That gets a nine from me.

180
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:08,071
[SPEAKER_11]: That's hot.

181
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:10,573
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been a naughty listener.

182
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:12,475
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been a very naughty listener.

183
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:16,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number three comes to us from DarkSakura.

184
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:20,481
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you decide to annoy the listeners, I mean bring joy with tonight?

185
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:20,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey!

186
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:22,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Just teasing.

187
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:24,124
[SPEAKER_05]: This song's called Emo Kid.

188
00:17:24,765 --> 00:17:25,545
[SPEAKER_05]: That should say it all.

189
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:27,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, here it is then.

190
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number three in tonight's cage match, Emo Kid.

191
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:34,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Just don't call DarkSakura one or she'll rip your heart out and then stomp on it.

192
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:38,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear Diary, Mood, apathetic.

193
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:40,787
[SPEAKER_01]: My life is spiraling downward.

194
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:44,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't get enough money to go to the Blood Red Romance and Suffocate Me Dry concert.

195
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:53,313
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks cause they play some of my favorite songs like Stab My Heart Because I Love You and Rip Apart My Soul and of course Stabby Rip Stab Stab.

196
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:56,614
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't help that I couldn't get my hair to that flippy thing either.

197
00:17:57,195 --> 00:17:58,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that guy from that band can do.

198
00:17:59,436 --> 00:17:59,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Some days...

199
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:24,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost emo enough to start shaving my legs Cause I feel real deep when I'm dressing in drag I call it freedom of expression, most just call me a fag Cause our dudes look like chicks and our chicks look like dykes Cause emo is one step below transvestite Stop my breathing and slit my throat

200
00:18:32,832 --> 00:19:01,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm dark and sensitive with low self-esteem The way I dress makes every day feel like Halloween I have no real problems but I like to make believe I stole my sister's mascara, now I'm grounded for a week Sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies I can't get through a Hawthorne Heights album without sobbing Girls keep breaking up with me It's never any fun, they say they already have a pussy They don't need another one Stop my breathing and slit my throat I must be emo, I don't jump around when I go to shows

201
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:17,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I must be emo, dyeing my hair and polish on my toes I must be emo, I play guitar and write suicide notes I must be emo My life is just a black abyss, you know?

202
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:27,258
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so dark, and it's suffocating me Grabbing a hold of me and tightening its grip Tighter than a pair of my little sister's jeans Which look great on me, by the way

203
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:57,766
[SPEAKER_04]: When I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction Hearing songs about getting dumped give me an erection I write in a live journal and wear thick rimmed glasses I tell my friends I bleed black and cry during classes I'm just a bad, cheap imitation of God Figuring me catch her in the rye and watch me jack off I wear skin tight clothes while hating my life If I said I like girls, I'd only be half right I look like I'm dead and just like a homo I must be emo, screw Xbox, I play old school Nintendo

204
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,493
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents don't get me, you know?

205
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:17,394
[SPEAKER_01]: They think I'm gay just because they saw me kiss a guy.

206
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:19,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a couple guys.

207
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:21,376
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, it's the 2000s.

208
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:25,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't two or four dudes make out with each other without being gay.

209
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:28,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, chicks dig that kind of thing anyways.

210
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:29,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, diary.

211
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I think you're the only one that gets me.

212
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:33,861
[SPEAKER_01]: You're my best friend.

213
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:37,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like tacos.

214
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number three in tonight's KH match, Adam and Andrew with Emo Kid.

215
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:49,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see what kind of emotional reactions that got out of our judges here in the studio.

216
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:51,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, our votes don't count, yours do.

217
00:20:51,843 --> 00:20:52,884
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you how to vote in just a minute.

218
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:53,504
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.

219
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:54,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Eleven.

220
00:20:56,745 --> 00:21:02,487
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my friends played that for me, the one who... That song is, like, the best.

221
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:03,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

222
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:04,787
[SPEAKER_05]: It made me crack up.

223
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:05,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki!

224
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:08,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't care for it very much.

225
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:09,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Six.

226
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:14,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Spike, my whole life is a dark room.

227
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:17,218
[SPEAKER_02]: One big dark room.

228
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:20,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, definitely a nine.

229
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:21,941
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, though?

230
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:26,525
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to give that song a high score, but then they had to go and make fun of people that play classic Nintendo.

231
00:21:26,605 --> 00:21:28,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, not cool.

232
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:29,527
[SPEAKER_11]: So you lose some points for that.

233
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:32,510
[SPEAKER_11]: However, it does entitle the song to get a six.

234
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,913
[SPEAKER_11]: As in, six, six, six, the sign of the devil.

235
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:39,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I want tacos.

236
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:44,488
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a 39 cent taco.

237
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:47,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Diary, Mood, Apathetic.

238
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,210
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

239
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:49,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Here you go.

240
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:51,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the three songs you can vote for tonight.

241
00:21:51,532 --> 00:21:53,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number one, X Noise, Diffusion.

242
00:21:59,636 --> 00:22:00,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that was a shitty clip.

243
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:01,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's try that again.

244
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:06,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Much better.

245
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,060
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

246
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number two you can vote for tonight, Bittersweet with Dirty Laundry.

247
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:25,301
[SPEAKER_11]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Adam and Andrew with Emo Kid.

248
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:26,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, place vote now.

249
00:22:26,302 --> 00:22:28,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

250
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:29,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.

251
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:29,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.

252
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:29,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.

253
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:29,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I'll cut you.

254
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:48,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

255
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:20,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Artistic in this context.

256
00:23:20,862 --> 00:23:22,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that another word for emo?

257
00:23:24,184 --> 00:23:24,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

258
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:25,985
[SPEAKER_05]: But not really.

259
00:23:26,565 --> 00:23:27,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Heart!

260
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:33,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear DeviantArt, My soul is black.

261
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,711
[SPEAKER_05]: It is as black as the bottom of a kettle.

262
00:23:38,232 --> 00:23:44,396
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of the darkness within me, I feel the need to draw nothing but pretty light-colored flowers.

263
00:23:45,677 --> 00:23:47,658
[SPEAKER_05]: With sunshine and rainbows.

264
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:52,514
[SPEAKER_05]: to express my desire to have love in my life.

265
00:23:53,414 --> 00:23:55,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Because otherwise it's a pit of loneliness.

266
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:58,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I want burritos.

267
00:23:59,217 --> 00:24:00,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that the name of the new Morrissey single?

268
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:02,458
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was You Have Killed Me.

269
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:04,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's actually true.

270
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,180
[SPEAKER_05]: The new Morrissey stuff is pretty cool.

271
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:13,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, so like, let's just go back and just have Viva hate and then kill him before he can make his other records.

272
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:21,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I like the one he did with Suzy.

273
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:23,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Interlude.

274
00:24:23,356 --> 00:24:24,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was awesome.

275
00:24:26,158 --> 00:24:27,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that one a whole lot.

276
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:34,885
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm tallying up cage match votes right now, and Did You Lose a Sock actually has a DeviantArt he wanted to share.

277
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:35,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at it.

278
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:37,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay, cool.

279
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:40,150
[SPEAKER_05]: And hooray for everybody giving Morrissey love.

280
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:41,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

281
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:43,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually a really big Morrissey fan.

282
00:24:43,031 --> 00:24:44,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen them like four times.

283
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:46,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, this new stuff doesn't work for me.

284
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:54,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shoot, but the Babyland last night though, I cannot rave enough about how awesome they were.

285
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is how the night went to start off.

286
00:24:57,582 --> 00:25:02,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Iguana Girl and I go and get sushi, which you know, me and her and sushi, we fell right into a sushi coma.

287
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:04,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was beer.

288
00:25:04,327 --> 00:25:04,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

289
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:05,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck I love sushi.

290
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:07,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.

291
00:25:07,063 --> 00:25:08,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to take you to this place.

292
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,284
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, really yummy.

293
00:25:09,304 --> 00:25:12,905
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Sugata in Berkeley.

294
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:13,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Really good.

295
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:21,347
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when I was out in Chesapeake, Virginia weeks and weeks ago, that trip I was on for a couple weeks, I had really freaking good sushi when I was there.

296
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:24,427
[SPEAKER_11]: And who would have thought you could get good sushi in Chesapeake?

297
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:25,808
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was actually really good.

298
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:26,708
[SPEAKER_11]: I was surprised.

299
00:25:27,368 --> 00:25:29,929
[SPEAKER_05]: This place that I went to was really expensive, but they were very good.

300
00:25:29,949 --> 00:25:31,469
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got a free Japanese lesson.

301
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:35,036
[SPEAKER_05]: He asked me something that I didn't quite understand.

302
00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:36,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, uh, chotto.

303
00:25:36,957 --> 00:25:38,078
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, chotto!

304
00:25:39,078 --> 00:25:41,259
[SPEAKER_05]: He's so happy that I used it right.

305
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,541
[SPEAKER_05]: So I said, next time I come in, I'm going to order like this.

306
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:46,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Koreto, koreto, koreto.

307
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:47,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, are.

308
00:25:48,823 --> 00:25:49,903
[SPEAKER_05]: And he laughed at that.

309
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:50,564
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty funny.

310
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:51,564
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a bad joke, but hey.

311
00:25:51,824 --> 00:25:53,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I guess you have to speak Japanese to get it.

312
00:25:53,745 --> 00:25:54,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was funny.

313
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:55,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that cute?

314
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,047
[SPEAKER_11]: She sounds like a cartoon.

315
00:25:57,227 --> 00:25:58,808
[SPEAKER_05]: This and this and this and oh, that.

316
00:26:00,376 --> 00:26:00,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

317
00:26:01,257 --> 00:26:10,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so we went on to the venue and the first band sucked, so we went and got beer at the brewery across the street.

318
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we went back and the Mormons were on and they sucked, so we went and got more beer.

319
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:16,845
[SPEAKER_05]: We missed Ninja Academy.

320
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:21,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Go back to listen to 8-Bit and then Babyland freaking owns my soul.

321
00:26:22,568 --> 00:26:22,928
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

322
00:26:23,188 --> 00:26:24,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you done tallying now?

323
00:26:24,189 --> 00:26:24,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they're done.

324
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:24,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm done.

325
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:25,550
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm ready to go.

326
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,471
[SPEAKER_11]: You ready to hear who won tonight's cage match?

327
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:27,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo-hoo!

328
00:26:28,513 --> 00:26:29,554
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good time.

329
00:26:29,614 --> 00:26:30,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's check it out.

330
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:31,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I was surprised.

331
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:33,516
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't quite a landslide vote tonight.

332
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:35,056
[SPEAKER_11]: All three songs got a lot of lovin'.

333
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:37,438
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the end, there could be only one.

334
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:40,059
[SPEAKER_11]: And the wave of the future is... Emo.

335
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,760
[SPEAKER_11]: You silly little emo kids, you.

336
00:26:48,971 --> 00:26:52,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Sky, what do you think the revolution's other secret is?

337
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:10,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

338
00:27:27,654 --> 00:27:28,434
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

339
00:27:52,168 --> 00:27:52,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe... You know what?

340
00:27:52,768 --> 00:28:00,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of me cosplaying at Faname, I think my iBook should cosplay, and it can cosplay as Bjork.

341
00:28:01,135 --> 00:28:02,176
[SPEAKER_11]: I could cosplay as Bjork.

342
00:28:02,216 --> 00:28:02,796
[SPEAKER_11]: That might be fun.

343
00:28:02,896 --> 00:28:03,076
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

344
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:04,797
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you have to cosplay with me.

345
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:06,419
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not doing Naruto.

346
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,441
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a headband you could borrow.

347
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:10,482
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you do.

348
00:28:10,502 --> 00:28:12,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I just picked up my Sand Village because I'm cosplaying Tamari.

349
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:15,385
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too big for my head.

350
00:28:15,405 --> 00:28:16,126
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

351
00:28:16,949 --> 00:28:19,189
[SPEAKER_11]: And this whole time I thought you had a huge head.

352
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:19,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

353
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,970
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

354
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,370
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

355
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:23,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

356
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

357
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:24,331
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

358
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:26,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

359
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:26,331
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

360
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:27,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo.

361
00:28:27,411 --> 00:28:27,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

362
00:28:28,851 --> 00:28:29,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

363
00:28:29,492 --> 00:28:29,672
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

364
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:30,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

365
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,052
[SPEAKER_11]: So your birthday party's next week.

366
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:32,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

367
00:28:32,692 --> 00:28:35,233
[SPEAKER_11]: And your birthday birthday itself is on... Wednesday.

368
00:28:35,353 --> 00:28:35,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Wednesday.

369
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:36,533
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, when day is it?

370
00:28:36,593 --> 00:28:36,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

371
00:28:37,073 --> 00:28:38,473
[SPEAKER_05]: And Thursday, right?

372
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:40,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we're doing something on Thursday.

373
00:28:40,874 --> 00:28:41,174
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

374
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:44,618
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

375
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:00,551
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not as bad as 40, so smile!

376
00:29:22,515 --> 00:29:27,118
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, I hung out with Disney Punk 10 on last Saturday.

377
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,020
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I went to see Babyland last night.

378
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,383
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Wednesday I'm going to eat at Bon Lair.

379
00:29:34,783 --> 00:29:36,565
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pub downtown for fish and chips.

380
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:39,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't tell the Stalker fans where you're going to be.

381
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:41,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

382
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Thursday we're doing something.

383
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,091
[SPEAKER_05]: And Friday is Silent Hill.

384
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:49,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And Saturday is my birthday party at my annual Dave & Buster's.

385
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,871
[SPEAKER_05]: and Sunday is me falling into a coma and sleeping.

386
00:29:54,213 --> 00:29:57,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Monday my massage therapist is taking me to the pub.

387
00:29:58,709 --> 00:29:59,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Lucky.

388
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:02,993
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want a massage therapist at all, let alone one to take me out.

389
00:30:03,293 --> 00:30:05,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you going to get a massage at the pub?

390
00:30:05,855 --> 00:30:06,075
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

391
00:30:06,496 --> 00:30:07,156
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no, no.

392
00:30:07,176 --> 00:30:07,777
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be hot.

393
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:10,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this pub going to do the candle thing again?

394
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that sounds awesome.

395
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see it.

396
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

397
00:30:12,741 --> 00:30:14,842
[SPEAKER_05]: They every so often do Ye Olde Pub Night.

398
00:30:14,902 --> 00:30:16,804
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish they would play pipe organ music, too.

399
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:17,905
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be badass.

400
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:18,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in a pub.

401
00:30:18,565 --> 00:30:21,128
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to have bagpipes or something.

402
00:30:21,928 --> 00:30:22,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a pan flute.

403
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:23,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

404
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:52,025
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I'm waiting for birthday money I'm actually getting something I've asked for one of my birthday presents the one from my husband to be something for the show sweet I've asked for a high MD mini disc recorder I want that camcorder Loki has I've decided it'll make the home porno so much easier I may have my own camera person I may have my own camera person at E3 too if all works out

405
00:30:52,628 --> 00:30:53,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Very cool.

406
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:53,809
[SPEAKER_11]: We hope.

407
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:54,370
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying.

408
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,010
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

409
00:30:55,711 --> 00:30:57,773
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fierce like a diva in a good way.

410
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:05,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I wear a peacock dress like Margaret Cho does?

411
00:31:07,342 --> 00:31:07,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Ew.

412
00:31:08,382 --> 00:31:08,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Ew.

413
00:31:08,943 --> 00:31:09,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Ew.

414
00:31:09,163 --> 00:31:09,564
[SPEAKER_10]: What, Loki?

415
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:09,804
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

416
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:12,987
[SPEAKER_10]: They put out the floor plan for E3 this year.

417
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:13,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's up?

418
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:17,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, I personally love hanging out at Konami's booth.

419
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:19,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately.

420
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:22,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of Buena Vista being where it was.

421
00:31:22,817 --> 00:31:23,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

422
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:24,919
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the N-Gage Arena!

423
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,180
[SPEAKER_11]: What?!

424
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, they put Konami next to N-Gage?

425
00:31:28,442 --> 00:31:30,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, N-Gage, no.

426
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:34,086
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard SNK's not in the main building this year.

427
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:35,167
[SPEAKER_11]: They're down in Kenshia.

428
00:31:35,508 --> 00:31:37,229
[SPEAKER_11]: So who took their place, is what I want to know.

429
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:38,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

430
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:41,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but Ketch is the cool place to hang out.

431
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:42,735
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the indie place.

432
00:31:42,795 --> 00:31:43,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but, you know.

433
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:44,176
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like where all the hipsters hang out.

434
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:46,097
[SPEAKER_10]: And Rockstar doesn't have a booth this year either, I heard.

435
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:48,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, 2K has a booth, and that might as well be Rockstar.

436
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:54,743
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we never answered the poor guy's question, what do we think the next secret on the revolution is.

437
00:31:55,403 --> 00:31:57,565
[SPEAKER_11]: We've mentioned holographic, or what was it?

438
00:31:57,645 --> 00:31:58,846
[SPEAKER_11]: What was this?

439
00:31:58,946 --> 00:32:00,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Stereoscopic 3D?

440
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:02,768
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the... Holo projections.

441
00:32:02,828 --> 00:32:04,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Also mentioned nachos.

442
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

443
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,852
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the best serious answer I've got for you.

444
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:12,879
[SPEAKER_11]: and Roz says more like N-Gay.

445
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:13,739
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm sorry.

446
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,660
[SPEAKER_11]: The N-Gage is not allowed to be gay because that would disrespect my people.

447
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:19,341
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to go there.

448
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,022
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see an America's Army booth, though.

449
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:23,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

450
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:25,883
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

451
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:31,725
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to have a contest now, thanks to the chat room, where I give out my infamous nacho cheese sauce recipe.

452
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:35,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get to the chat room, FU, shall we?

453
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:36,287
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think so.

454
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:38,728
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to give them an old classic song to start us off.

455
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:56,102
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, chatroom FUs.

456
00:32:57,163 --> 00:32:58,584
[SPEAKER_05]: We're using that again from now on.

457
00:32:58,705 --> 00:33:01,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark Knight says, FU to me working on Easter Sunday.

458
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:01,908
[SPEAKER_11]: End of line.

459
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:06,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Illusion says, FU goes to Loki for not singing karaoke last night.

460
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:14,539
[SPEAKER_11]: VXJasonXV says, FU to the chatroom.

461
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,320
[SPEAKER_11]: That song blew.

462
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:18,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

463
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:25,042
[SPEAKER_11]: GK128 says, F you to my GPU fan that it decided it wants to keep flickering on and off, leaving my laptop hot.

464
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I have to try and fix you, you bastard.

465
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:34,226
[SPEAKER_11]: MiniMe283 says, F you to EGM for still not sending me my first issue, and I renewed in freaking December.

466
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:39,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I complained to them last week, and they said I'd get my April issue in six to eight weeks.

467
00:33:41,314 --> 00:33:42,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's just like Game Informer.

468
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:44,456
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't freaking got my May issue yet.

469
00:33:44,676 --> 00:33:47,537
[SPEAKER_11]: MiniMe283, you won our freaking 24 contest.

470
00:33:47,557 --> 00:33:48,738
[SPEAKER_11]: You have no right to be upset tonight.

471
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:51,599
[SPEAKER_11]: I retract that FU.

472
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:59,623
[SPEAKER_11]: The23rdMagga says, Quick FU to having to spend an entire week feigning interest in every little thing a relative says you should be interested in.

473
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:03,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Also a big FU to being cooped up in a hotel for an entire week.

474
00:34:03,565 --> 00:34:10,329
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to being forced to watch five straight hours of Law & Order to the point where you root for the asshole defense attorney who looks nothing like Phoenix Wrong.

475
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:16,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Legend of Zaku says, something and I haven't played in five months.

476
00:34:16,923 --> 00:34:18,584
[SPEAKER_11]: But the first part of his FU got cut off.

477
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:19,965
[SPEAKER_11]: How sad.

478
00:34:20,986 --> 00:34:23,368
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkTetsuya says, FU to Travis Donovan.

479
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:26,270
[SPEAKER_11]: He threatened to move his show to Sunday just to mess with you guys.

480
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:26,851
[SPEAKER_11]: LOL.

481
00:34:27,591 --> 00:34:29,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, oh, bring it, bitch.

482
00:34:29,272 --> 00:34:30,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you know what?

483
00:34:30,213 --> 00:34:37,319
[SPEAKER_11]: If you even try and move a show on to Sundays, we will bring the Spike and Dark Sakura nerd show to Saturday nights.

484
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:41,700
[SPEAKER_05]: And who volunteered to do this for me?

485
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:47,482
[SPEAKER_11]: I think somebody's just bitter that we have higher ratings this one month.

486
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:51,684
[SPEAKER_11]: It's alright, we have love for Travis.

487
00:34:51,944 --> 00:34:55,106
[SPEAKER_11]: For the people who don't know out there, why don't you explain who Travis is?

488
00:34:55,606 --> 00:35:04,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, he's the host of UnderStationLive.org, which I shouldn't be giving him a free plug when he says such nasty things about us, but it was the show that I got my start on.

489
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I should say my second song, because I actually started on a college show.

490
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:08,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I was the most often guest.

491
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:15,543
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, DarkSakura had a lot of experience on that program as well, and it was the first live 365 thing we did.

492
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:19,289
[SPEAKER_10]: And to answer your question, who's taking SNK's booth, it would be Game Infinity.

493
00:35:21,272 --> 00:35:21,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they were there.

494
00:35:22,114 --> 00:35:22,635
[SPEAKER_10]: They were there, though.

495
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:28,951
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, chatroom guys, you need to send those over private message to me, otherwise I miss them.

496
00:35:28,991 --> 00:35:34,916
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll try, because I know we have new chatters tonight, I'll try and read them out of the chatroom, but please, please, please send them over private message if you want to make sure I get them.

497
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:41,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to myself for not putting more money in for playing Supernova when I went to my nearby location test.

498
00:35:42,022 --> 00:35:46,967
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to having shitty stamina while playing Supernova since I made the mistake of wearing Converse.

499
00:35:48,872 --> 00:36:07,410
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100 Matt says F you to Anizona the Arizona anime convention for putting a 1200 person cap on the convention second year in a row they've underestimated the anime fan population in Phoenix Ranma says F you to the internet and file sharing I can't find the theme to Finders Keepers damn that was an awesome game show

500
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:13,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeremy Todd 1 says, F you the week goes to my school because we don't have a spring break.

501
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,495
[SPEAKER_11]: We just get a three-day break for Easter.

502
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:16,255
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to school.

503
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:21,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and F you to making me sit by the computers for a couple hours straight to listen to your show.

504
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Boss Tone says, F you to not having a supernova test location near me.

505
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:28,142
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think there was one in the chat from somebody new.

506
00:36:29,283 --> 00:36:32,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, did you lose a sock says F you to the people who hated the emo song.

507
00:36:32,505 --> 00:36:33,586
[SPEAKER_11]: I have it on my iPod.

508
00:36:34,006 --> 00:36:35,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And DJ Kibbles and Bits says,

509
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:40,788
[SPEAKER_11]: says F you to OXM trying to qualify scoring a 10 for Fight Night Round 3.

510
00:36:42,528 --> 00:36:45,249
[SPEAKER_11]: And HitStun says F you to the feedback of my voice on the Skype line.

511
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:45,969
[SPEAKER_11]: It's distracting.

512
00:36:46,949 --> 00:36:48,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Turn your volume down when you do that.

513
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:49,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

514
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,150
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

515
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:52,990
[SPEAKER_11]: What, Extifer?

516
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:53,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Why'd you steal a microphone?

517
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:54,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have something to say?

518
00:36:56,171 --> 00:36:57,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you gotta turn it on, too.

519
00:36:58,511 --> 00:36:59,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ever gonna do a show again?

520
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:00,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure!

521
00:37:01,232 --> 00:37:01,532
[SPEAKER_08]: When?

[SPEAKER_08]: On...

523
00:37:04,053 --> 00:37:04,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Someday.

524
00:37:05,494 --> 00:37:05,994
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

525
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:07,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I still want a title.

526
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:12,118
[SPEAKER_08]: If people can come up with a fucking title, I can come up with a show.

527
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:13,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you were going to do Extover's World of Thursdays.

528
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:15,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I can.

529
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:16,060
[SPEAKER_05]: You can call it Friday Eve.

530
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:19,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, I won't, but thank you for that.

531
00:37:19,282 --> 00:37:19,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, fine.

532
00:37:22,383 --> 00:37:25,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Miklatov, say hello to our listeners.

533
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:25,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

534
00:37:25,945 --> 00:37:26,426
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing?

535
00:37:27,326 --> 00:37:27,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine.

536
00:37:27,806 --> 00:37:28,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

537
00:37:28,627 --> 00:37:32,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything you want to say about, you know, stuff going on in the world?

538
00:37:35,257 --> 00:37:35,657
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

539
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:36,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

540
00:37:36,638 --> 00:37:41,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that was five minutes of radio.

541
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:45,823
[SPEAKER_08]: He said no like that was just clever or something.

542
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:46,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you high?

543
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:47,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesus.

544
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:53,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Friday is Eve.

545
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:55,048
[SPEAKER_08]: That might work, actually.

546
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:57,109
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to do it for tonight's Afterbirth.

547
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:58,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a great week, everybody.

548
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo, doggie!

549
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:01,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you have something to say, Miklatov.

550
00:38:02,092 --> 00:38:05,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody go watch Silent Hill the movie this coming week.

551
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,494
[SPEAKER_09]: We already talked about that.

552
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:08,835
[SPEAKER_09]: When is that?

553
00:38:09,475 --> 00:38:10,476
[SPEAKER_05]: On Friday.

554
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:11,336
[SPEAKER_09]: On Friday?

555
00:38:11,817 --> 00:38:12,077
[SPEAKER_09]: When?

556
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,118
[SPEAKER_05]: The 21st, the night it opens.

557
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:16,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I will talk to you more about it later than what time.

558
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking either the last or second to last show.

559
00:38:19,272 --> 00:38:20,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I could probably do one of those.

560
00:38:20,335 --> 00:38:21,959
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll post a time up in my lab journal.

561
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, cool.

562
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:23,623
[SPEAKER_11]: I will go.

563
00:38:23,703 --> 00:38:25,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell him about the cheese head idea.

564
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:28,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to get cheese hats and repaint them to be pyramid head.

565
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,202
[SPEAKER_09]: So, the color of rust?

566
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:31,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

567
00:38:31,983 --> 00:38:32,663
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be hot.

568
00:38:32,763 --> 00:38:38,484
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we all go in... We have to fill in the holes, because I don't want to be a broken pyramid head.

569
00:38:38,744 --> 00:38:42,765
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be the broken pyramid head society.

570
00:38:43,225 --> 00:38:44,265
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds depressing.

571
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:47,846
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need little, like, three-inch, you know, spikes to go.

572
00:38:48,446 --> 00:38:49,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just take a knife.

573
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:50,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Plastic knives!

574
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:52,407
[SPEAKER_09]: How about a real knife?

575
00:38:52,727 --> 00:38:53,747
[SPEAKER_09]: We go in with sporks.

576
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:55,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sporks would be cool, actually.

577
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:56,048
[SPEAKER_09]: We go in with sporks.

578
00:38:56,108 --> 00:38:56,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Sporks.

579
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:58,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a legend.

580
00:38:58,568 --> 00:38:59,008
[SPEAKER_11]: I am a legend.

581
00:39:26,562 --> 00:39:27,803
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I said alleged.

582
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:28,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

583
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:30,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I was legend.

584
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,044
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're not.

585
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:31,684
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great book.

586
00:39:32,004 --> 00:39:32,825
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great movie.

587
00:39:33,065 --> 00:39:33,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

588
00:39:33,925 --> 00:39:34,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop talking.

589
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:37,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I like beer.

590
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:39,487
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you want to say, Christopher?

591
00:39:40,268 --> 00:39:42,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Wondershowsin is so freaking hilarious.

592
00:39:44,658 --> 00:39:47,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob got to watch some of it last night.

593
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,639
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm seriously ending this show.

594
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:53,580
[SPEAKER_11]: So tune in next week for more fun here on Orange Lounge Radio.

595
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is, kids, your fortune cookie message.

596
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the day.

597
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,401
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send a flood to wipe out all the bad things.

598
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:03,321
[SPEAKER_00]: I will save two of everything, but everything else goes.

599
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:04,842
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be a lot of umbrellas.

600
00:40:05,662 --> 00:40:09,042
[SPEAKER_00]: You, Noah, stop what you're doing and build me an ark.

601
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:11,943
[SPEAKER_00]: And Noah, who is Sean Connery, who is...

602
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,193
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on a speedboat at the moment.

603
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Speedboat's much faster.

604
00:40:19,176 --> 00:40:21,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll shoo across the water a lot faster.

605
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:24,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Be great photos for the Bible.

606
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:36,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I appreciate your sense of publicity, but I want an ark with a big room for poo.

607
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:37,772
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be important.

608
00:40:40,788 --> 00:40:42,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Speedboat, let's go for a speedboat.

609
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,789
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get all the animals with long ears.

610
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:49,270
[SPEAKER_00]: They can sit along the side of that ears and... Because I like that.

611
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,610
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you build me an ark.

612
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a big motor in an ark if you want compromise.

613
00:40:55,851 --> 00:40:57,591
[SPEAKER_00]: So he started to build himself an ark.

614
00:40:57,611 --> 00:40:58,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Started sawing up timber.

615
00:41:01,312 --> 00:41:02,832
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not actually how you start sawing, is it?

616
00:41:03,312 --> 00:41:08,613
[SPEAKER_00]: You start sawing by going... That first bit where you...

617
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:22,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're into the middle bit of where you feel like your dad.

618
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,123
[SPEAKER_00]: When your dad used to say, I'm off out to the garage to saw a plank of wood in heart.

619
00:41:33,845 --> 00:41:36,046
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.

620
00:41:38,828 --> 00:41:39,629
[SPEAKER_00]: No reason for it.

621
00:41:40,925 --> 00:41:43,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's see if Dr. Bronowski's still on television.

622
00:41:43,546 --> 00:41:44,786
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ascent of Man.

623
00:41:47,127 --> 00:41:48,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Sundays with my dad, that was.

624
00:41:49,847 --> 00:42:00,730
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, um, so the middle bit of the song, and then the end goes back into, and after a while, Noah realized he was actually punching a baboon.

625
00:42:04,351 --> 00:42:04,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Get off me!

626
00:42:10,081 --> 00:42:11,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright kids, that's it.

627
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:11,963
[SPEAKER_00]: End of line.
