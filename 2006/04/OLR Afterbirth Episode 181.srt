00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Thank you.

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:24,240
Bring on the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth.

3
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Here we are.

4
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,440
It's the part of the show you can only hear on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

5
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,840
It's too hot to podcast, people.

6
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,560
I love this comment from SSJ100Matt in our chat room.

7
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,600
Those two should have a Friday night nerd podcast.

8
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,000
I think referring to Spike and Dark Sakura.

9
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,320
Would you like to be a guest on Pump Up the Volume

10
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,080
in the next couple weeks?

11
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,160
It'll take a little bit of effort to be out here,

12
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,480
but I would love to.

13
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,200
Tuesday night, we will have geek chat

14
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,560
in between music requests.

15
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,200
Kill me.

16
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,160
No, I'm kidding.

17
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,640
I love this new wallpaper.

18
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,800
What's the wallpaper you got?

19
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Someone in the chat room put up Taiko no Tatsujin wallpaper

20
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,680
off of 4chan, so it's now my wallpaper on my laptop.

21
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,120
It replaced Silent Hill.

22
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,640
She'd be proud.

23
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,680
So what's the plan for the Silent Hill movie, yo?

24
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,520
I know we've got to go see it, but what?

25
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,440
Yeah, I want to get a big, big group together on Friday,

26
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,040
because I'm having one of our listeners and a good friend

27
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,840
come up from the Bay Area to come to the movie with us.

28
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,720
and just want to get as many people together to just nerd out the movie and it would be cool though

29
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,600
if we all had like those cheese hats and repainted them to look like pyramid head

30
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,960
you nerd that is such a good idea i would totally do that and like carry around like you know a

31
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,840
little three inch spear you know what's what's sad though is that i'm getting invited to a lot

32
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,160
of these things i mean i i'll probably do jamie's because she does have the birthday advantage

33
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,640
so who yeah so I'm but you know I know says it's a lot of people planning on

34
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,320
going to see this like a lot of video game fans I'm very excited for how

35
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,760
I just hope they don't disappoint us with this movie I'm very excited I would

36
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,200
love to do the cosplay though at at a the movie cuz that is

37
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,660
fuckin nerdy I mean we could put out a press release and everything in the

38
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,720
media would be there taping us in our pyramid head hats I'll be great

39
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,240
that would be awesome like a hot we should call a movie theater and try to

40
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,480
sponsor something locally they'll be awesome

41
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:26,280
Well, I know I'm going to be putting out a massive review on our stuff.orangechallengeradio.com

42
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,920
which has been given some attention by me lately.

43
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,800
Yes, I actually looked at it the other day and you're the only one updating it.

44
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,640
I think that's going to actually see a lot of updating during E3.

45
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:45,760
My personal plan is to go to the business center at E3 and do intermittent stuff updates.

46
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,280
And we're still trying to figure out how we're going to do podcasts.

47
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Unfortunately, we're in a weird situation where our hotels are going to be very far apart.

48
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,280
So, I'm just hoping that we can somehow do the podcast still in some way.

49
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,280
If, you know, I've got shuttle from my hotel to E3 if someone gave me a ride back to my hotel.

50
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
We might be able to make that work.

51
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,280
It's gravy. Except, now this is what my hard thing is going to be.

52
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,280
It's because I'm pulled between doing DDR Freak stuff and doing Orange Lounge stuff.

53
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,280
So, you know.

54
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,280
I'm trying to fit everything in.

55
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
So, if worse comes to worse.

56
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,280
I'm probably going to skip Roscoe's this year.

57
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,640
You might have to contribute individual reports or something. We'll figure something out.

58
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,560
I'm probably gonna skip Roscoe's this year though.

59
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,240
Roscoe's is overrated now. It's so 2004.

60
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,240
I can't eat Roscoe's anymore just because I get sick off of most food now, so.

61
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,960
Yeah.

62
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,400
You know, unless I cook it myself.

63
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,560
All right. Anyway, let's do a little bit real quickly of how was your week, how was your day?

64
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,200
Just real fast and then we'll move on here to the cage match. DarkStalker, how was your week?

65
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,640
I had the bird flu and then I worked and it was my spring break when I had the bird flu

66
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,640
So thankfully I didn't have to go to class on Tuesday

67
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,320
Which was my flash class anyway, and I would have been dead. I've been like flash blah

68
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,560
I love my flash class, but God I did though. It was pretty funny cuz a week before

69
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,000
The teacher had us review our our animated ads, you know

70
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,860
I did the Silent Hill one and she spent like maybe two minutes on everybody else like 15 minutes on mine

71
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,800
What was she saying about it? She loved it. She said that it was fantastic

72
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,120
And I got I got a good scrawn except to turn it in a little bit late

73
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,620
But you know she just and then we actually had a discussion because I have that rain effect

74
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,840
But it trails off and so we decided that the way to get it to complete to

75
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,340
continuously scroll the rain effect is to set up new frames of animation on the

76
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,380
main story reel and have it replay them at different times so I'm trying to

77
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,220
figure out how to do that because I'm I'm still a flash newbie but at least

78
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,580
I've got the design part down well congratulations thank you I'm actually

79
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,780
working on a flash design for us I'm working on doing a special orange

80
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,660
lounge photo gallery but I need to take a picture of your desk oh god why I'm

81
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,520
going to use your computer as the frame for the placeholder for the images to

82
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,240
pop up in. Oh okay. But it's it's gonna be it's gonna be a month or so out it's

83
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,980
gonna it's gonna require so with all the crap all around and yes the crap is I'm

84
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,060
actually gonna add in more crap in Illustrator. Oh goody. So it's gonna be

85
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,420
the uber crappy desk and I'm gonna expand your desk by like another you

86
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,100
know two feet. Yeah I wish I could really have that that would be nice. So I'm

87
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:37,380
gonna be working on it. Alright. Um. Loki, how was your week? How was your day? Well,

88
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,340
my week was pretty good. I had my bachelor party last night, and I got very sick drunk,

89
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:49,540
and I basically, we went to Golf Land, um, drunk and went and played some mini golf,

90
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:55,100
And I apparently played some Mario Kart GP, which I am right now recording to my computer

91
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,060
so we can put it on the website, because I'm doing a lot of yelling.

92
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,380
And the face that I have on the thing is hilarious.

93
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,820
You have to see this.

94
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:14,260
But yeah, I look really wasted there, and I don't remember actually playing Mario Kart.

95
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,460
I wish I could tell you if it was good or not, but I don't remember.

96
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,700
I know I'm not getting married anytime soon, but I kind of want to have a bachelor party

97
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,740
just so I can get drunk and be the center of attention for a night.

98
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,180
I'll go, and I'll buy you drinks.

99
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,460
Yay!

100
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,660
Maybe I can have an anti-bachelor party, I don't know.

101
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,420
I was punching the screen, that's just- Yes you were, it was great.

102
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,620
Right, check out that video soon, it'll be up on OrangeLodgeRadio.com.

103
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,420
Spike, how was your week, how was your day?

104
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:48,580
I threw a party Friday night, which was basically a big excuse to play Power Stone with people

105
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,220
I don't really know.

106
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,540
And I played Karaoke Revolution several times.

107
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,020
Didn't we sing I Got You Babe?

108
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,520
Yes, we did!

109
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,180
I do a mean share, I just wanted to point out.

110
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,860
I love doing a mean share.

111
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,860
It was awesome.

112
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
Good times.

113
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,860
Alright.

114
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Is that it?

115
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,860
Um.

116
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,020
You're just a regular party animal.

117
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,020
Oh yeah.

118
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,020
No.

119
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,500
So, yeah, no, I had a very game-centric week.

120
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,660
Threw a party, played games.

121
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,900
Played games and not at a party.

122
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,140
That's the long and the short of it.

123
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,220
All right.

124
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,460
Sounds awesome.

125
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,220
My week of my day was pretty good.

126
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,980
Played a little bit of, oh, fancy 11, and played other games.

127
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,940
And just kind of, I had a overall pretty mellow week.

128
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,900
Easter was today, so I went to my parents'

129
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,560
where we had leftovers because my parents

130
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,940
didn't feel like cooking.

131
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,820
And then, I'm trying to think.

132
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,700
Friday we went to that party so that was you know part of the weekend there

133
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,220
because you don't exactly live around the corner so it's a little bit of a

134
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,340
drive but it's good it was all worth it so but I was the probably the only sober

135
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,700
person there which was kind of interesting so that made me a little sad

136
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,580
tear your share would have been a little better and drunk I think probably I

137
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,900
would've been a lot louder and probably woken up the neighbors but then driving

138
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,020
home wouldn't have been fun see the reason I threw a party this week is

139
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,300
because I my downstairs neighbors were evicted oh that's why I wasn't telling

140
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,020
anyone to shut their mouth oh god that's great oh yeah we should have held held

141
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,500
the party downstairs could have broke in such a good idea

142
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,820
would've been awesome all right uh moving on let's get into the orange

143
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,940
lounge radio cage match sound like a plan sure all right since we have new

144
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,020
people listening for the first time tonight the orange launch radio cage

145
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,260
match is where we play three songs for you guys a clip of last week's winner

146
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,660
and then two new songs for you guys and

147
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,660
You guys vote and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge radios

148
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:46,760
24-hour day seven a week music and video game program or I should say video game and music program. Hello

149
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,000
So we got song number one tonight. You only get to hear a clip of that because it won last week

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,440
It's Loki's pick and I believe it was the X noise diffusion. That was the name of the song. Yes

151
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,440
So here it is a clip of song number one last week's winner you can vote for tonight

152
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,160
Remember you cannot place a vote until all three songs have played and at that time

153
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,840
I'll tell you how you vote, but you have to be in the chat room to do it orange launch radio.com click on chat

154
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,560
Here's a clip of song number one X noise with diffusion

155
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
I

156
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:41,200
Alright, that's song number one you can vote for tonight.

157
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,480
noise with diffusion but it has to beat two other songs two brand new songs

158
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,440
going into tonight's cage match the first one is my pick and I decided to

159
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,320
pick a song by a group called bittersweet which I think is a good name

160
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,800
for a band and the song is called dirty laundry and I have a lot of that on the

161
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,480
floor of my bedroom so I think this is a very appropriate choice and I like this

162
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,440
because it's kind of it's kind of jazzy that's what I like about this so here's

163
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Here's my pick, song number two, Bittersweet with Dirty Laundry, enjoy.

164
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:46,440
And when he needs an alibi, he can use me all night

165
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:54,440
Ooh, was it fun to play the same?

166
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Ooh, I think I'd rather misbehave your way

167
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:18,440
I'm just a bad girl, that's why we get along We'll make excuses for anything on the way

168
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:28,440
I'll pull the trigger, hit a flash, watch her hurry, step back

169
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Ooh, what's a fun and plain escape

170
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Ooh, wouldn't you rather misbehave

171
00:14:43,440 --> 00:15:12,440
Oh, baby, show me the money, my evil friend

172
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Let's go to Mexico, drink margaritas and

173
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,440
I'll light a candle, walk in love

174
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Come on baby, let's

175
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Ooh, what's a fun and plain to say

176
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Ooh, I think I'd rather misbehave Your way, was it fun and play inside?

177
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Ooh, I think I'd rather misbehave

178
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:22,440
I'm simply bad

179
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:37,200
Alright, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

180
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Bittersweet with Dirty Laundry.

181
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Let's go around and see if they like that song in the studio or if they want to watch

182
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
it.

183
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Dark Sakura.

184
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,440
It was cute and it wasn't trans, it gets a nine.

185
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Loki.

186
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
It was okay.

187
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
Gets like an eight.

188
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Spikes!

189
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,600
That flashed me back to the Sharon Apple portions of Macross Plus.

190
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,280
big big bonus in my book i definitely go with like a nine for that uh that for me was music

00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:39,640
heart out and then stomp on it dear diary mood apathetic my life is

197
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,200
spiraling downward I couldn't get enough money to go with the blood red romance

198
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,160
and suffocate me dry concert it sucks cuz they play some my favorite songs

199
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,160
like stab my heart because I love you and rip apart my soul and of course stab

200
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,240
And it doesn't help that I couldn't get my hair to that flippy thing either

201
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,040
Like that guy from that band can do Some days, you know

202
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,760
I'm an emo kid, non-conforming as can be You'd be non-conforming too if you looked

203
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,760
just like me I have paint on my nails and makeup on my

204
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,600
face I'm almost emo enough to start shaving my

205
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,000
legs Cuz I feel real deep when I'm dressing in

206
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,080
drag I call it freedom of expression which just

207
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,920
call me a fag Cuz our dudes look like chicks and our chicks

208
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,520
look like dykes cause emo is one step below transvestite

209
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:28,840
Stop my breathing and slit my throat I must be emo, I don't jump around when I

210
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,200
go to shows I must be emo, I'm dark and sensitive with

211
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,080
low self esteem The way I dress makes every day feel like

212
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,840
Halloween I have no real problems but I like to make

213
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,120
believe I stole my sister's mascara now I'm grounded for a week

214
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies I can't get through a Hawthorne Heights album

215
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,160
without sobbing. Girls keep breaking up with me. It's never any fun, they say they already

216
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:57,640
have a pussy. They don't need another one. Stop my breathing and slit my throat. I must

217
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:04,640
be emo, I don't jump around when I go to shows. I must be emo, dyeing my hair and polish on

218
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:12,480
my toes. I must be emo, I play guitar and write suicide notes. I must be emo. My life

219
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
I must be emo

220
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,480
My life is just a black abyss, you know?

221
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,480
It's so dark, and it's suffocating me

222
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Grabbing a hold of me and tightening its grip

223
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
Tighter than a pair of my little sister's jeans

224
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,480
Which look great on me by the way

225
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,480
When I get depressed, I cut my wrist in every direction

226
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,480
Hearing songs about getting dumped give me an erection

227
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
I write in a live journal and wear thick rimmed glasses

228
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,480
I tell my friends I bleed black and cry during classes

229
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,760
I'm just a bad, cheap imitation of goth You could even catch her in the rye

230
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,880
And watch me jack off, I wear skin tight clothes While hating my life, if I said I like girls

231
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,680
I'd only be half right, I look like I'm dead And dress like a homo

232
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,680
I must be emo, screw Xbox, I play old school Nintendo

233
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:06,920
I must be emo, I like to whine and hit my parentals I must be emo, me and my friends

234
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:15,240
all look like clones I must be emo my parents don't get me though they think

235
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,400
I'm gay just because they saw me kiss a guy well a couple guys but I mean it's

236
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,640
the 2000s can't two or four dudes make out with each

237
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,280
other without being gay I mean chicks dig that kind of thing anyways I don't

238

247
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,780

248
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:39,660
As in 666 the sign of the devil I want tacos

264
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,720
because we don't have much time so somebody needs to talk about something

265
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,680
to take attention away from me for a minute. Everyone needs to look at my last

266
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:10,040
deviantart picture because I'm you know my whole inner artist. What's up with

267
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:16,280
deviantart? Isn't that kind of an emo site? No it's just where people go to be

268
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:25,720
artistic artistic in this context is that another word for emo yes but not

269
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:36,200
really heart dear deviant art my soul is black it is as black as the bottom of a

270
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:42,400
kettle and because of the darkness within me I feel the need to draw nothing

271
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:49,780
but pretty light colored flowers it was sunshine and rainbows to express my

272
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:57,040
desire to have love in my life because otherwise it's a pit of loneliness I

273
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,920
want burritos isn't that the name of the new Morrissey single no that was you

274
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,280

275
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:12,240
okay yeah so like let's just go back and just have Viva hate and then kill him

276
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:19,960
before he can make his other records well I like some of them I like the one

277
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:27,000
he did with Susie Oh interlude yeah that was awesome I like that one a whole lot

278
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,280
but I'm tallying up cage match votes right now and did you lose a sock

280
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,240
for everybody giving Morrissey love. Yay! I'm actually a really big Morrissey fan, I've

281
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,720
seen them like four times, I just, this new stuff doesn't work for me. The, um, oh she,

282
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,600
the Babyland last night though, I cannot rave enough about how awesome they were. Okay,

283
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,640
this is how the night went, to start off. Iguana Girl and I go and get sushi, which

284
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,180
you know, me and her own sushi, we fell right into a sushi coma, and it was beer. Fuck I

285
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:13,180
I love sushi. I have to take you to this place. It's really, really yummy. It's called Sugata in Berkeley. Really good.

286
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:21,180
You know, when I was out in Chesapeake, Virginia weeks and weeks ago, that trip I was on for a couple weeks, I had really freaking good sushi when I was there.

287
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:27,180
And who would have thought you could get good sushi in Chesapeake? But it was actually really good. I was surprised.

288
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:32,180
Well, this place that I went to was really expensive, but they were very good. And I got a free Japanese lesson.

289
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,480
He asked me something that I didn't quite understand. I was like,

290
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,680
uh, chotto. He's like, chotto!

291
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,180
He was just so happy that I used it right.

292
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,880
So I said, next time I come in, I'm gonna order like this, corretto, corretto, corretto.

293
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,680
Ah, are! And he laughed at that. That's pretty funny. It was a bad joke, but hey.

294
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,080
Yeah, I guess you have to speak Japanese to get it, because I thought it was funny.

295
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,880
Isn't that cute? She sounds like a cartoon. This, and this, and this, and oh, that.

296
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:09,060
okay anyway so we went on to the venue and the first band sucked so we went and

297
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,260
got beer at the brewery across the street and then we went back and the

298
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,220
Mormons were on and they sucked so we went got more beer we missed Ninja

299
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:22,700
Academy go back to listen to 8-bit and then Babyland freaking owns my soul so

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,620
all three songs got a lot of love in but in the end there could be only one and

304
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:50,100
the wave of the future is emo you silly little emo kids you all right if you

305
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,900
would like to send in an F you of the week now's a good time to do so cuz

306
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,020
going to read Chatroom FUs and then we're going to call it a show. Meanwhile, comments

307
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,540
from Chatroom, let's see, there was somebody had said something about, oh, Jeremy Todd

308
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:10,860
1 was asking, Sky, what do you think the revolution's other secret is? I think we've kind of talked

309
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,140
about this a little bit on the show before. It makes nachos. Yes, actually it will do

310
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:22,580
your dishes. File your taxes. Yes, and reminder, boys and girls who aren't dependents on somebody

311
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:28,040
else's. Taxes due tomorrow. Guess who hasn't done hers? In the US, yeah. Because if you're

312
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,160
in another country, you don't have to do taxes tomorrow, but the rest of us do. I did my

313
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,180
taxes back in February like a good boy, so I'm already done. Me too. Na na na na na.

314
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:41,520
I've already spent my return. Me too. Where do you think my iBook came from? Or as I call

315
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,640
it, actually my, it's the iBook. Because I named it after Bjork, so it's an iBook. How

316
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,760
cute. Will it wear a swan? I want it to.

317
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,240
Maybe, you know what, instead of me cosplaying

318
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,360
at um, Fonami, I think my

319
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,240
iBook should cosplay and it can cosplay as Bjork. I could cosplay as Bjork.

320
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,480
That might be fun. What? No, you have to cosplay with me. I'm not doing no doe.

321
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,560
I think you have to. I have a headband you could borrow.

322
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,860
I know you do. I just picked up my Sand Village because I'm cosplaying Tamari.

323
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,600
It's too big for my head.

324
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,720
And this whole time I thought you had a huge head. Shut up.

325
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,000

336
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,960
You're supposed to feel better because you're not actually 40

337
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,840
30

338
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,400
But it's not as bad as 40 so sorry now

367
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,680
unfortunately

368
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,620
instead of when it is to being where it was uh...

369
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,200
is the engage arena

370
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,000

371
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,240
I heard SNK is not in the main building this year. They're down in Kenshia.

372
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,360
So who took their place is what I want to know.

373
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,760
Yeah, but Kenshia is the cool place to hang out. It's like the indie place.

374
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,080
Yeah, but, you know. And Rockstar doesn't have a booth this year either, I heard.

375
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,840
Well, 2K has a booth and I might as well be Rockstar.

376
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,720
You know, we never answered the poor guy's question, what do we think the next

377
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,800
secret on the revolution is.

378
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,120
We've mentioned holographic, or what was it? What was this

379
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,800
stereoscopic 3D?

380
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,240
the low project hollow projection mention not just yes

381
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:12,240

382
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,040

383
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,400
that would disrespect my people I was just gonna go there

384
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,440
I don't see an America's Army booth though

00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,060
The 23rd Magus says, quick FU to having to spend an entire week feigning interest in

418
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:54,960
It's all right. We have love for Travis for the people who don't know out there. Why don't you explain who Travis is?

419
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:02,040
Oh, he's the host of under station live org, which I shouldn't be giving him a free plug when he says such nasty things about us

00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,200
I could probably do one of those. So I'll post a time up in my life journal.

475
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,440
Okay cool. And tell him about the cheese hat idea.

476
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,580
I want to get cheese hats and like repaint them to be pyramid head.

477
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:35,600
So the color of rust? Yeah. That'd be hot. So we all go in. We have to fill in the holes.

478
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,200
Cause I don't want to be a broken pyramid head. We'll be the broken pyramid head society.

479
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,320
haha haha haha that sounds depressing

480
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,600
and we need a little like three-inch you know spikes

481
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,360
I'll just take a knife

482
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,200
how about a real knife? We go in with sporks. Oh sporks would be cool.

483
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,720
We go in with sporks.

484
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,200
Extrofer, Darktide Studio sent me a private message suggesting if you make like a

485
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,600
forum thread or something they'll help you with names

486
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,000
really? So make a post. I'll see if I can

487
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,320
pull that out of my ass. There you go.

488
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,840
So... I love how a talk about pulling things out of your ass suddenly made you go,

489
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,320
Oh, hey! I was peaking and pulling things out of my ass.

490
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:23,560
Um, forgot what I was going to say, so thank you, Sky, or Ski, or your legend Sky name.

491
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,400
I'm a legend? Yeah. I am a legend!

492
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,200
No, I said alleged. Oh.

493
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,960
I thought I was legend. No, you're not. That's a great book.

494
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,120
That's a great movie. Yeah. Stop talking.

495
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,280
Um, I like beer.

496
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,160
What do you want to say, Ex-Super?

497
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,120
Wonder shows and is so freaking hilarious.

498
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,840
Like cancer.

499
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,080
Rob got to watch some of it last night.

500
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,920
All right.

501
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,880
I'm seriously ending this show.

502
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,840
So tune in next week for more fun here on Orange Lounge Radio.

503
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,680
Here it is, kids.

504
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,760
Your fortune cookie message over the day.

505
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,800
I will send a flood to wipe out all the bad things.

506
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,640
I will save two of everything, but everything else goes.

507
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,580
And there will be lots of umbrellas.

508
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,620
You, Noah, stop what you're doing and build me an ark.

509
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,220
And Noah, who is Sean Connery, who is...

510
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,300
I'm working on a speedboat at the moment.

511
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:22,900
Speedboat's much faster. It'll shoo across the water a lot faster.

512
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,900
It'd be great photos for the Bible.

513
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:37,020
No, I appreciate your sense of publicity but I want an ark with a big room for poo, it's

514
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,020
going to be important.

515
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:43,740
Speed boat, let's go for a speed boat and we can get all the animals with long ears

516
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,740
they can sit along the side of their ears and blow them out.

517
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,980
Because I like that.

518
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,340
No, you build me an ark, put a big motor in an ark if you want compromise.

519
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,840
Alright. So he started to build himself an arc, started sawing up timber.

520
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,840
That's not actually how you start sawing, is it?

521
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,840
You start sawing by going...

522
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,840
That first bit where you...

523
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,840
Then you're into the middle bit of...

524
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,520
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, where you feel like your dad.

525
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,960
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, when your dad used to say,

526
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,240
I'm off out to the garage to soar a plank of wood in her.

527
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,360
Ooh, ooh, ooh, kiddo.

528
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,040
There we go.

529
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,240
No reason for it.

530
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,560
Let's see if Dr. Banosky is still on television.

531
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,040
Be a scent of man.

532
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:54,480
Sundays with my dad that was so yes, so the middle bit of song whoo and then the end goes back into

533
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,600
After a while Noah realized he was actually punching a baboon

534
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:28,400
Alright kids, that's it, end of line.
