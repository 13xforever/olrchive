who syndicates our show weekly.
We also let them have a crack at this little live segment.
So tonight we thought, okay, we're not going to be having a live show next week because Loki's getting married, right, Loki?
Yes.
All right.
So we thought, and we have a lot of chatters who wants to know, who is Loki getting married to?
So we asked her to sit in for a little bit so we could say hello.
So please say hello to Nellie.
Hi, everybody.
How you doing?
I'm doing good.
So you're getting married to Loki next week, correct?
Sadly enough, yes.
Why do you say sadly enough?
I don't know.
Sadly for him.
Okay.
First thing they wanted to know, are you into video games at all?
No.
No, why not?
Because they're boring.
Do you think they take away from cuddle time or...
No, I have a pretty rigid regime in the house where he can't play him when I'm there.
No, I don't know.
I just, like, I don't understand the fascination.
You don't?
No.
That's right.
I don't even know how to use the buttons.
What are you into?
Porn.
As you've told everybody already.
I was just teasing, though.
You don't have to say that just because I said that.
Are you really into porn?
I guess.
And what kind of porn do you like?
All kinds.
Alright, well that's cool.
Dog porn.
So there's not a single... You don't like dog porn?
She's just trying to make yourself sound freaky because you're marrying her.
How long have you and Matt been together?
It's going to be five years in July.
So what made you choose the 30th for your wedding date of April?
I don't know, random.
Did you just throw a dart at the calendar and that's what you got?
Um, actually, sort of.
I opened the calendar and I pointed my finger and there it was.
How did he propose?
I can't say.
It was that awful.
Okay.
No.
But there was a lack of clothing at the time.
Ew!
Oh God, I gotta wash my brain, I gotta wash my brain.
No, it wasn't that bad, it was very sweet.
I was Loki's roommate at the time.
Yes, you were.
I think you were probably like right outside too, like with your computer.
Doing video games.
Masturbating, I don't know.
Oh, maybe, I don't know.
Let's see.
What else was I going to ask you?
So he's going to E3, like a couple weeks after the wedding.
I know, bastard.
And does that piss you off?
We've come to an agreement about it.
Okay, what's the agreement?
He gets to go to E3.
And he gets me a present.
But what if he brings back a t-shirt?
Then he's going to be in trouble.
No, anything he'll bring me, I will love because I love him.
And he basically lets me have whatever I want anytime I want.
So it's about time I gave something back.
What is it that you see in Loki?
Because a lot of our listeners think he's a dick.
They're fucking dicks.
I'm just kidding.
Everybody loves Loki.
Great.
I'll kick some ass.
Except for the Apple fans.
Do you use computers now?
A computer?
Yeah, I know you're not that big a retard.
She likes those stupid, pretty computers.
Oh my gosh, the Apples.
They're so pretty.
So you like Apples?
Only because they're cute.
I don't need to do anything on it.
I just need to be able to access my email, look up porn, of course.
And that's about it.
Yeah, the first day I had this laptop, I freaking couldn't even work on it at work because I had to go in a conference room to remove the porn that she put on the backdrop.
I'm funny, shut up.
It was great.
It was like this giant vagina and the girl didn't even do a good job waxing because you could see the little hairs growing back.
It was so funny.
Now I got a bleach in my brain.
Oh, God.
This is why we don't podcast this little bonus segment here.
Well, I actually did that during the show.
I know.
The week he got that laptop, the first thing you did was started putting porn on it.
Yes.
Because I was asking if you want a gay porn site so you could use.
I was just trying to save him some time.
What kind of work do you do for a living?
You don't have to tell us where, but what kind of work?
I talk on the phone and yell at dumbasses all day.
Really?
Ever had any really annoying customers you just got to yell at completely?
I don't yell at customers.
I yell at notaries, and every notary is an idiot, pretty much.
I don't know.
I don't have any funny stories.
I should have prepared better.
That's all right.
Well, you came on here last minute.
You're a good sport.
Did you see the shirt we got him last week?
Yes, it's funny.
He wore it to work.
Did he?
Okay.
That's good.
We just want to make sure you weren't going to be offended by it, but I knew you.
Game over.
You know it's totally true.
I know.
He's done for.
The chatroom is saying Loki's whipped.
Is this true?
No.
Hey, sometimes I wish we were a TV show.
Oh, plug my Myspace thing.
It's got a picture of how whipped he is, I guess.
Does it?
Okay, so you're in the top eight on our Myspace, I believe.
Yes, I am.
Didn't we move you in there?
I think we did.
So if you go over to Myspace.com slash Orange Launch Radio, Nellie is in our top eight, I believe.
I believe we put her in there.
I think so.
So check it out.
And they want to know what Loki's shirt in the video you just put up on OLRPSP.com says.
I'm a groom, I'm doomed, show me your hooters Did you see the little buttons, Nelly, too, that we had?
The little bachelor party in progress, the little light-up titties?
Yeah, those are cool.
Those lit up for a really long time.
The next day they were still flashing.
Mine never flashed, ever.
I guess I knew I was gay.
So, who planned the wedding?
You or Loki?
Me.
Oh my god, I should let them plan a wedding.
It'd be like all computer party wedding.
Oh, shut up.
Whatever.
Video games.
You know, I went to a wedding where they had Halo at the reception.
A Halo wedding cake?
Yeah, a Halo wedding cake and a reception with Halo.
Can you guess who that was?
Oh, wait.
A friend of yours.
I don't know.
He's a friend of the show.
Yes.
All right.
We'll tell you.
We'll talk more about it later.
I don't know if there was anything else I was going to ask you.
Is there anything else I should ask her about?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
My co-worker Idrine, who knows my taste, she got me this video.
It's called, I Walk a Mile to See Some Camel Toe.
And we watched it, and my boss watched it, and so now everybody knows I'm weird.
Oh, can we put that on our website?
What?
The video?
If you want to.
What was I going to say?
Let's see, somebody was saying here, somebody wanted to know your boob size, but you don't have to tell them that.
Or you make it up.
They kind of vary.
If I gain weight, it's a D. If I lose weight, it's a C. Right now, I'm fat, so...
I'm so hot I know, I'm going to bed too I know
I know, Rob's in the wedding.
Don't I have to subject myself to Jewish traditions for the wedding?
Yes, you do.
Because you're a little yarmulke.
Shut up, Matt.
Because you're Jewish, right?
Yeah, I'm a Jew.
Okay, well, that's not a problem.
We have listeners that are Jewish.
I am a Jew gold.
After we're married, I shall show Matt where I stash it.
Oh, you see, you like South Park.
Yeah.
Okay, there you go.
Oh, boy.
Too hot for podcasts.
That's right.
You know, I will only subject myself to such, you know, religious traditions.
Well, one, I've never met a Jewish person I didn't like.
Seriously.
I've never met a Jewish person I didn't like.
I can show you a few.
I know.
I'll probably meet some at the wedding, you know.
Ha!
Yeah.
But, you know, I'm willing to try new and interesting things.
It'll be fun.
Yeah, they're all kosher.
All right.
All right.
We're going to talk about games.
So anything you want to say to our listeners, our hundreds of thousands of listeners, listen to us.
Hi, listeners.
Get a life.
Okay, thank you.
That's Nelly, everybody.
Loki's fiance, the lucky gal.
All right, let's shut the door.
New listeners in chat tonight.
We really appreciate that, you guys.
Thank you so much for tuning in and supporting us.
It must be working.
People must really be telling their friends.
Or maybe it could have been that story, too, that got a little bit of publicity a couple weeks ago.
I wonder if we got anybody through that.
I don't know.
Most people actually probably ignored that.
There was only one site that actually mentioned us.
Well, not really mentioned us.
They mentioned a site that stole the story from another site that stole the story from another site about
The story being correct.
When the whole Castlevania thing came out.
Yeah, that's right.
When the Nintendo Power confirmed the Castlevania thing, nobody said, oh, I guess this proves Orange Lounge Radio's story is true.
But that's how it works, is that people don't care where the news originally came from.
So why stop caring, too?
Well, we'll see.
You know what?
We're going to just make announcements on the air only so that only our listeners get to hear it from now on.
We've done that before and everyone ignores it.
That's true.
Well, who cares?
Our listeners found out.
That's the important thing.
Maybe it was just me.
I don't give a shit about other people.
What?
I seem to have an entourage of newbies.
Maybe it was just me.
I don't know.
Maybe.
Alright, let's go around.
This is the afterbirth portion of the show.
We don't podcast this because, you know, we talk, maybe we talk a little bit about games, but, you know, we talk about us and, you know, what we've been up to and just a way for our fans to connect with us over the past few years.
Because we used to do this show for three hours when it was the Balmani show, but if you actually listened back then, you know it would be about 30 minutes of Balmani and then two and a half hours of, you know, fucking around.
It was a train wreck, but it was THE train wreck.
Yes, it was a train wreck everybody was buying tickets for.
At least, you know, all three of you that listen regularly.
How was your week?
How was your day?
Magus!
Ah, my week, my day.
Well, my week, high point of the week was going down to Dave & Buster's for a very special birthday.
Not mine this time, though.
And a little bit of pet peeve about that, they card everyone who goes in, and me, I'm almost 21, almost.
They card me, I can't get in.
Until, uh, the special birthday guest comes on in, and, uh, says, oh, oh, oh, he's with me.
But, uh, little thing about Dave & Buster, Dave & Buster's is awesome, if you haven't been there, it's, Rob put it best one time as, uh, Chuck E. Cheese for Grown Ups.
Or I also say it's a Las Vegas hotel without gambling.
Well, pseudo-gambling, you have like the, uh... Okay, gambling for children, the tickets thing.
Yeah, tickets.
But you can get all sorts of shit there, and just all the machines they have are just pristine.
Aside from that, I haven't really been doing much lurking game facts a bit, getting some World of Warcraft, trying to get my character up a couple honor ranks.
Um...
What level is your character in WoW?
Currently 56, almost 57.
Orc Rogue on Maelstrom.
That's RP PvP.
Emphasis on RP.
Maelstrom.
I wonder if that's the same one he plays on.
No, but it's not PvP.
His isn't PvP, I don't think.
He plays on Malfurion.
Malfurion, yeah.
Very close name.
It's PVE.
It's one of the newer PVE servers.
He's 60 on Malfurion.
Extifer is what we keep pointing to, my roommate.
But I stopped playing World of Warcraft.
I think my highest character was like 25.
I didn't play very much.
It's kind of sad, and I'm kind of ashamed of it.
I started on Maelstrom on the day Maelstrom was launched, the day RPPVP servers were launched.
I started my character.
I started Kroth.
I started that rogue.
and it's been about six months since the server came out and I'm just now getting to 60.
Wow.
Well, you know what?
That's okay.
Stop and smell the steel bloom.
I played Final Fantasy XI for two years and never got a character to 75.
In fact, my highest level is 55, which is like nothing.
Nothing.
Like right before I quit, I was finally doing Genkai 1, which is the break the limit for 50.
Because I'm a slow player.
But now I'm making better progress the second time around on my new server.
I'm having a good time.
Even though I gave Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 a negative review, I'm still playing it on Xbox 360.
Because I do like getting to sit my fat ass on the couch and play.
I just think a lot of people are really going to be turned off by the whole front end stuff.
And you don't want to feel like you wasted the money on it?
Yeah.
I guess that's part of it too.
I don't want to feel like my money's wasted.
Alright, anything else?
No, that's about it.
Loki, how was your week?
How was your day?
Um...
DarkSakura.com
So, it's just because at the end, you know, everybody's submitting their stuff last minute.
I know.
I hope I get something tomorrow or I'm going to cry.
So, just, yeah, be patient.
I've been doing, like, business cards and stuff, website stuff, and just, I don't know, getting ready for everything.
Finally, I got kind of a surprise.
My coworker
Ironically enough, one I don't like too much.
But apparently she has her good streaks now and then.
She's all, so you're on the A3?
I'm like, yeah.
And she's all, well, um...
DarkSakura and I want to go to that too.
I want to go to Sony, too.
Here's the thing.
Hook me up.
Hook a brother up.
They had a hell of a time getting me in, and they don't have any extra passes.
Otherwise, you know, it would be no problem.
But, you know, probably next year will be a little different story.
So I'm looking forward to it because I cannot wait, you know, to try it, the revolution stuff.
So, yeah, it should be awesome.
My day and my week were okay, as I mentioned before.
I've kind of talked about a lot of it already, because of course I went to DarkSakura's birthday thing yesterday at Dave & Buster's and watched her drink a little bit.
By the way, just so you guys know what I got her for her birthday, I got her a thing of Patron, the tequila she really likes.
It ain't cheap, let me put it that way.
But it's hers.
Let's see, what else did I do?
Thanks for watching!
Scary stuff.
And we just booked our hotel, finally, too.
We're going to be not that far from the E3 Outpost, because we're going to be doing stuff with our buddies over there at allgames.com, which should be fun.
And it is open to the public all but Wednesday night.
I think all the other days it's open to the public, so you can come down to the E3 Outpost, and they're going to be doing games and all that good stuff.
It's basically, it's kind of like a cyber cafe from what I understand, but it's consoles.
and you can rent consoles.
They have like HDTVs and Scott Rubin who used to be with G4TV.com and his buddy Lawrence, they do a show there every day over at AllGames.com.
So they're going to be doing that for E3 as well.
We're going to be doing something I don't know, with our buddy Bobby who also does a show over there.
Should be fun!
Um, let's see.
Should we get into Cage Match?
Do you guys have anything you want to talk about?
Anything random?
I don't have an agenda for tonight.
I didn't come up with anything, so.
I've been actually working on that, because, okay, I'm trying to, my stupid laptop, now, granted, I know everyone's like, you don't even got a Mac.
No, listen, I want to do stuff with my laptop.
So anyways, the whole problem was I found out the reason why my laptop was crashing is because the RAM I had apparently was bad.
And so I had a gig stick in here that I bought for $100 or whatever.
And I looked at it.
I'm like, you know, this already has a gig in it.
And upgrading it only to a gig and a half for $100 isn't really a great deal.
So I turned around, took that money that I got from the gig stick, bought a minidisc player.
for recording audio interviews and wireless mics to go with that.
So that's kind of cool.
But on top of that, I've been trying to get my computer to network my computer at home.
It networks fine with this one.
Of course, I just fucked it up about a second ago when I said disable the wireless connection because I was trying to change the network because it wasn't seeing you.
But anyways, hopefully now it's working.
No, it's not because Windows sucks.
Good job!
Anyways, my cage match is on the internet and you need to download it.
Well, then I guess we should get into tonight's cage match, shouldn't we?
So, cue the music.
Remember to participate in the cage match.
You have to be in chat.
www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
Click on chat.
The way the cage match works, since we have some noobs tonight, we're going to play three songs for you guys.
You hear a clip of last week's winner and then two new songs.
And the winning song goes into our regular rotation over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com all week long until we claim another winner.
So starting off tonight, DarkSakura's pick won last week.
You guys like the emo song.
So it's the winner.
It was Adam and Andrew was the artist and it was Emo Kid.
And I've seen this on a lot of my spaces.
So maybe some of you guys have heard this before.
Here is a clip of song number one you can vote for tonight.
Adam and Andrew with Emo Kid.
Mood apathetic.
My life is spiraled outward.
I couldn't get enough money to go to the Blood Red Romance and Suffocate Me Dry concert.
It sucks cause they play some of my favorite songs like Stab My Heart Because I Love You and Rip Apart My Soul and of course Stabby Rip Stab Stab.
And it doesn't help that I couldn't get my hair to that flippy thing either.
Like that guy from that band can do.
Some days, you know.
I'm almost emo enough to start shaving my legs Cause I feel real deep when I'm dressing in drag I call it freedom of expression, let's just call me a fag Cause our dudes look like chicks and our chicks look like dykes Cause emo is one step below transvestite Stop my breathing and slit my throat
I must be emo I'm dark and sensitive with low self-esteem The way I dress makes every day feel like Halloween I have no real problems but I like to make believe I stole my sister's mascara, now I'm grounded for a week Sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies I can't get through a Hawthorne Heights album without sobbing Girls keep breaking up with me It's never any fun, they say they already have a pussy They don't need another one Stop my breathing and slit my throat I must be emo I don't jump around when I go to shows
I must be emo, dyeing my hair and polish on my toes I must be emo, I play guitar and write suicide notes I must be emo My life is just a black abyss, you know?
It's so dark, and it's suffocating me Grabbing a hold of me and tightening its grip Tighter than a pair of my little sister's jeans Which look great on me, by the way
All right, that was song number one tonight's cage match.
Last week's winner, Adam and Andrew with Emo Kid.
A nice long two-minute clip for you guys.
Will it win tonight?
It's up to you guys in chat, but you can't vote until all three songs have played.
And the second song tonight is my pick, Me, Me, Me.
And I picked a song by a band that I like, a little trancy band called Phragma.
And the song I picked tonight is called Radio Waves, which I think is appropriate.
and I just downloaded some random trance compilation and this was on it and I figured you guys needed a good trancy song.
So here it is, Pragma, Radio Wave, song number two.
Enjoy.
There's no way back, but I still see you I'm searching through, forgotten airspace And through white noise, you reach out to me You reach out to me
Radio waves through the empty mind Radio waves through the lows and highs Radio waves keeps the flame alive
Thanks for watching!
Song number two was by Fragma tonight, Radio Waves.
Let's go around and see what our studio thought of that.
Remember, our opinions are just that, opinions.
It's your votes that make the decision.
Andrew, what do you think?
I like good chopped up type of beat.
It doesn't get boring.
Good synth, really meaty bass.
I could have used a little more kick to it in some of the higher regions, but really good, really trance-y little tune.
Really good for ambi.
I'd give it a nine.
That was a really comprehensive review.
Usually we get people in here and just go, sucked, three.
Good job.
Loki, okay, seven.
See?
See what I mean?
Look at what that asshole did.
Me, I like it.
I think the only problem I have with it is it gets a little quiet in the middle part, and I'm like, ooh, I'm going to fall asleep, and then, oh, shit, I just woke up.
Like I said, could have used a little more kick.
Exactly.
Could have used a little more kick in the butt in the middle.
Needs more cowbell.
Yes, more cowbell would have done good in the middle.
Viva.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
All right, Loki, what'd you pick tonight?
I picked a song, a remix of a song that we actually won Cage Match.
Yeah, butch, by the way, it's been in the Cage Match about four times now under different remixes.
No, it has not.
Listen, it has not been under in different remixes.
It's only been under the Cage Match once.
One time.
This is a remix of Pendulum, Hold Your Color.
This is the bipolar mix, and it's actually quite different than the original.
How appropriate.
We have a bipolar song and an emo song in tonight's cage match.
Gotta love OLR.
It's good.
Trust me, it's off their single, so it's pretty cool.
Alright, here it is.
You be the judge.
Chatroom, song number three, Hold Your Color, the bipolar mix by Pendulum.
Enjoy.
Song number three in tonight's cage match, Pendulum, Hold Your Color.
Don't hold your votes, though.
What do you think, Andrew?
I liked it.
It kind of had the kick that Rob's song kind of lacked.
It was like they couldn't decide on a tempo.
It went from mellow to upbeat to fucking hyper.
I like it.
I'll give it a 9.5, half point off, because, Loki, you're a goddamn cheater.
We love that about Loki.
Amen to that, Loki.
It's a remix.
Goddamn cheater.
What's your vote?
Completely different song.
At least it wasn't like the last one I picked.
I give it a 10 because I've been listening to the song.
I love it.
I must be emo, I'm dark, insensitive, but low self-esteem The way I dress makes every day feel like Halloween
And song number two you can vote for tonight, Fragma with Radio Waves.
And song number three you can vote for tonight, Pendulum, Hold Your Color, Bipolar Mix.
Place vote now.
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
Do it now, now, now, now, now.
Punch the keys for God's sake.
What, Loki?
What are you?
What?
Okay.
I don't see you make disgusting faces often.
It takes a lot to shock Loki.
They announced another game that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
Uno.
What?
That's cool.
I'm sorry.
I like Uno.
Screw you.
Screw that.
That's a fucking chatroom game.
That's not an Xbox game.
Fuck Uno.
You know what card game needs to come to Xbox Live.
And if you know this game, I love you.
So I'm waiting for the chatroom to shout it out.
It better be bullshit.
Come on.
Come on.
Not bullshit.
Come on.
Milborn
It's a French card game, and you're like a car, and you gotta go a thousand miles, and you have the stop sign, or the red light, green light, and then you can puncture people's tires.
It's all a card game, and I'll tell you what, it's one of my favorite card games I remember from when I was a kid.
I swear to God I'm not crazy.
Stop leaving me like that.
Somebody in chat room has got to know what I'm talking about.
Screw that.
I'll just play speed.
There was a computer version of it not that long ago.
I need to find that again.
Maybe one of our listeners knows of like an abandonware site or something where I can find this because they had a collection.
It had Rakko and Milbourne and there was another one.
What was that other really popular one?
Phase 12 I think is one of them.
I think there's another one, though, that's really popular.
It's like a gin rummy thing.
Okay, I'm looking at chat now.
Okay, some people know what I'm talking about there.
See, some people have it there.
Okay, well, tell us more about Uno on Xbox.
Well, I've got actual screenshots of it.
Apparently Xbox Oxide or whatever, Xboxide, whatever.
Their website, they have not only that, they have pictures of MotoGP 2006 gameplay.
Apparently they were sent some debug ones.
But for our in-studio guests, there's a picture of it.
That looks cool!
Impressive.
I know.
And you actually get to play it against other players online.
That's cool.
How can you say that that looks bad?
You're a bad man, Loki.
I know.
I don't know.
It doesn't say.
They just have a debug version of it right now on live.
Phase 10 says Color of Sakura.
That was the thing I was trying to think of earlier.
They are showing some of the achievements.
Uno, Bluff, Multiplayer, Quick Change Artist, Wild Abandoned, and Ace.
I don't know what the hell those are.
So for you achievement point whores, have fun.
Ooh, Color of Sakura linked me to a Millborn game.
That's funny.
This is not the same one I'm thinking of, but this will work.
You can change the rules.
That's kind of neat.
I don't know.
I guess I'd play this.
All the horsepower they have in that system, they're using it to play card games.
Kind of a waste.
This is just the Xbox Live Arcade stuff.
Alright, alright.
Fair enough.
More power to them for putting games on there.
Yeah, Xbox Live Arcade is supposed to be for shitty little games.
But there's some good stuff in there.
I want some damn Monopoly or Scrabble on Xbox Live Arcade.
Here, here.
I want old game shows turned into Xbox Live arcades.
I want Match Game on Xbox Live.
Remote Control on Xbox Live.
Remote Control!
Hell yeah.
These shots of... Charum wants a link to what you're looking at, Loki.
They're getting foamy at the moment.
Buy links now.
Okay, it's XboxSide.com.
They actually also have PlaySide.com.
Same type of thing.
It's basically a site that has a bunch of media on it.
So I will give you the link to the site.
Bookmark it.
It's a really good read.
You can watch some videos of stuff that you might not even see in other places.
Anyways.
Do-do-do.
DarkResurrection.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I'm done, ready to go.
I don't give them much time anymore to vote.
You gotta vote quick.
Alright, it was very, very close.
Only one vote determined the winner, but in the end, there could be only one.
And it was... Hold Your Color!
Which goes to show me that you all support goddamn cheating.
Good job.
Whatever.
Oh, Color of Sakura linked me to another Millborn PC game.
The one I'm thinking of had other card games in it.
It wasn't just Millborn.
It was like the official Millborn game, and it had Racco, and see, this is another Shareware one.
Good, a good start, but not the same one I'm thinking of.
It had Racco in, I think, Phase 10, and there's some other game.
I just can't think of the name.
Alright.
We're about ready to get into the chatroom FUs of the week.
I'm just waiting to get a few, so they're open.
If you want to send in your FUs of the week, send those over private message.
Meantime, what was the chatroom talking about earlier?
Clerks 2, right?
When's that movie supposed to come out?
I don't remember.
Soon, I know that.
I have to admit, I'm not that excited about it.
I love Kevin Smith movies, don't get me wrong, except I didn't really, like Jersey Girl was kind of whatever, but I understand why that movie was made.
But I don't know, my excitement for this movie hasn't been that as great as it should be.
Is that a sign that I'm turning 30 soon?
No.
I'm starting to wonder.
I'm no longer an angsty 20-something.
August 18th.
I'll go see it.
I'll see it too.
I will.
I've watched every single Kevin Smith film, good or bad.
And I did watch Jersey Girl and I didn't like Jersey Girl.
But you know what?
I sat through it and watched it.
And I will go see this because I love the Clerks movie.
I love the Clerks cartoon.
More the cartoon than the movie.
Oh, yes.
I think it could be still funny.
I'm just worried that they're going to try to pull it off like... You know, Jane Silent Bob Strike Back, not so good.
I mean, it was an okay movie, but it just wasn't as good as... edgy as Clerks.
It wasn't, you know, smart.
Just kind of dumb humor.
But, um...
I'm all for the Clerks animated movie, which is supposed to be coming out after Clerks 2.
That's the next thing he's working on.
Clerks, Clerks, Clerks.
I see another network going this way, and it's really sad.
Cartoon Network is putting reruns of Saved by the Bell on there.
No, that's awesome.
You shut up.
That's awesome, because they showed Jesse's song on Thursday night, which, by the way, is the episode that is...
I'm so excited!
I'm so excited!
I'm so excited!
Got you.
Got you.
GK128 says there's a rumor that Cartoon is actually trying to produce new Saved by the Bell episodes.
What?
Like Saved by the Bell the newer class.
Year 3 or Year... Get Elizabeth Berkley back.
What the hell's she done?
And Lark Voorhees.
What the hell happened to her?
No love for Lark.
Unless it takes place in the 80s, fuck it.
I don't want a modernized Saved by the Bell.
I don't want it.
I lived through that.
I don't want it.
I think they should make Saved by the Bell edgy like what was that one show that was on Fox for a while that had to deal with the faculty and stuff.
I don't remember what the hell it was called now.
Teachers?
Tiger Claw says what Cartoon Network needs is to put that old 80s Chuck Norris cartoon on.
Oh, hell yes.
Color of Sakura says they need to bring back Freakazoid, which met with much cheers in the chat room.
Freakazoid movie, live action, Jim Carrey playing the lead.
That would be the coolest shit ever.
SSJ100, Matt says Adult Swim should stop putting full house and putting fucking clerks on there.
They have full house on Adult Swim?
How rude.
The fuck?
Is that for real?
I don't think so.
Better not be.
I only heard of, um, just save at the bell.
Interesting.
But how long is it going to last?
Are they really going to have that for a long time?
That seems like one of those things.
They're airing all the big episodes.
They're not airing everything I don't think.
I don't know.
Because Jesse's song had the music video in it too.
It's a great episode.
It's quality television.
I T-voted it.
I swear to God.
If they want to play something at like 3 in the morning that's like, you know, just like the 80s live action TV show hour, that's fine.
They can do that.
But don't go with G4's doing this.
Ha, ha.
Ichiban Crush says in chat, Saved by the Bell is only going to be on Adult Swim for two weeks.
Okay, well, that's cool.
Then they can see they're airing all the memorable episodes, and then they can go to a different crappy 80s show.
I think that's cool.
I'm sorry.
Okay, that's fine, then.
But the whole thing is I don't like what they're doing in G4.
I'm just like, who the hell is directing?
I mean, seriously, someone needs to go.
Okay, yeah, G4 is supposed to be TV about games.
Please explain how...
Fastlane, Star Trek, Brainiac,
They sidestepped it.
They sidestepped it.
It's not TV about games.
It's TV for gamers.
Yeah, and it's not really games.
They've kind of admitted it's not really about games anymore.
Not all gamers watch Star Trek.
Most of us do.
Plus, didn't you see the press release this week that they hired Howard Stern's girlfriend to be the new host of Filter?
I thought that show failed.
It wasn't because of the host.
They're bringing it back, and it's not about gaming topics.
And they're going to be – Icons is now no longer – It wasn't about gaming topics when it was –
Icons is no longer going to be about gaming topics.
It's going to be about J.J.
Abrams and who's the guy that did X-Men?
Bryan Singer and all that stuff.
And what was the other thing?
Something about Attack of the Show being retooled.
They're adding another co-host to it.
Yeah, who is not even a game type person.
Well, most of them weren't anyway.
Anyway.
I'm still pissed when I ate up Tech TV.
I'm still sore over that.
That's why we like getting to work with Scott Rubin as limited as we do because we get to work with someone who jumped ship before it all went downhill.
That's how we know he's a smart man.
He got off that sinking ship before it hit rock bottom.
I don't get it.
Alright, I'm a gamer and I don't get it.
Let's get to FUs, okay?
We're gonna get to the chatroom FUs.
We have a lot of them, so here we go.
Tonight's FU music is being provided by Kid Whatever, who was on the show earlier tonight.
Dun dun dun.
Alright, um... Shaoran says FU to Girl Scouts for selling amazing cookies at such a high price.
I don't have no big monies to buy no fancy cookies.
FU to my computer for turning off at random moments for no good reason.
FU to myself for only just finishing my huge project for school.
Laser123454321 says, F you to Sky.
There's your shirt.
Where's my era?
Good, cool, fat mix.
I think I remember something.
It's something from the Rob Roberts show.
I have to check out this link.
I'm supposed to send them an MP3, and I haven't.
My bad, Laser.
I'm sorry.
I know.
Let's check this out here.
Control-V.
In which Rob gets completely whipped by his fans.
I can't get the link to come up, how sad am I?
Copy?
Hey, dap you to my computer for causing the- okay there we go, finally, let's see this.
Who's in control here?
Oh, it's the shirt.
This is what I want.
I said I want somebody to design a shirt that says, I figured out how to quit you.
Bye.
In the western font, like Brokeback Mountain.
And there it is.
I figured out how to quit you.
Bye.
Oh, God.
You know, I wish I knew how to quit you.
I'm gonna send that idea over to Busted Teaser.
I'll tap four, bitch.
I'll tap four.
Laser posted in the chat.
DidYouLoseASock says, What was song number two that lost by one vote?
It was the Emo Kid song.
And then the other one was only two votes.
Fine.
F you to Nintendo of America for not bringing Mother 3 stateside, but tip of the hat to Nintendo of Japan for actually making the game.
If you lose a sock, don't lose hope yet.
If it's not announced at E3, then get angsty, okay?
Gizm says, F you to Oblivion for taking up all my time.
You're on my Xbox Live friends list.
You are always on that damn game.
GK128, of course I'm always on Final Fantasy XI.
GK128 says, F you Natsume for taking three shitty This Gen Harvest Moon games to finally release one awesome one in Magical Melody.
What, Natsume?
Make another Lufia.
We want it.
Andy THPS says, F you to Korean online games for their insane XP curves.
The Ichiban Crush says, F you to that shitty Famicom game I had to review for LostLevel.org, which made me lose my love for Puyo Puyo.
DanceCook says, F you to my friend Andy.
He talked me into playing Strip Advanced Wars with him and I lost horribly.
That's hot.
Also, F you to the book Pulp because the ending made me really emo.
By the way, I wasn't mad when you called me DanceCook earlier.
Well good, because I just called you that again.
PhoenixRising says, F you to having to work so hard to level in MMOs and the overratedness of World of Warcraft.
Phoenix Rising would also like to say F you to Sony for opposing homebrew so much.
I will gank you.
ColorofSakura says F you to DreamLineOut for canceling their appearance at Bomani Fest 2006 and making Tokyo Game Action look bad.
I didn't know that.
That sucks.
That was like their big draw was that Mr. T, oh my gosh, that sucks.
Oh, yeah, the whole Tokyo game.
I didn't know that.
That's the first I heard of that.
Yeah, go to Bomaiso, read the front pages.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I'm gonna do that right now.
W-W-W dot B-E-M-A-N-I-S-T-Y-L-E dot C-O-M.
And this is Rob typing aggressively.
That's me typing with one hand, because the other hand's on the microphone.
Sure it is.
Yes, an actual microphone.
Wow, that's a big ol' no, Jesus Christ.
I can't read that much.
I'm sorry.
I need Cliff Notes.
Is somebody... Is Rennie listening?
Rennie, I need that article done in bullet points.
Please.
Thank you.
SSJ100Matt says, Sky, they are putting Full House on Adult Swim.
They just announced it.
Maybe that's the follow-up to Saved by the Bell.
SSJ100Matt would like to say, F you to Major League Baseball for not accepting my application for Final Cut Pro Editor.
Sephiroth1215 is passing along an F you to my hoes not getting me money.
BossTone says, F you to G4 for not showing the exact episode of the four shows they used to have for two months.
TetrisDSManiacoo64 says, F you to Hitstun for his mad TetrisDS skills.
He's been playing since the beginning and TetrisDS is my first.
F you to Loki for originally back months ago taking the whole Rush 2049 thing wrong and driving me insane, making me have to Skype today.
F you to Sky for mistaking me thinking that I have a wireless 360 controller.
I don't even have a 360, mind you.
I only have a wired 360 controller.
with the red cloud with zero drivers that I use for the few PC games I can play.
Here's me going, Wah!
Legend of Zaku says, F you to the freshmen and drunk assholes who happen to have Link Syndrome, if you get what I mean, trying to intrude on our private party in our apartment this weekend.
Control-Alt-F'd said a continuous F you to my workplace.
I'm tired of retail.
F you to the USPS for losing another Gamefly rental.
Dark Knight says F you to returning to work.
And lastly, Ryoma says F you to Mega Man X Maverick Hunter for being worse than the original.
That was a lot of FUs.
You all are some angsty motherfuckers tonight, I'll tell you that.
They must be emo.
Color of Sakura says Konami is giving that arcade a supernova machine.
That's very nice.
Speaking of which, we forgot to mention that Konami is going to have two supernova machines close to final at E3, which will be fun to play and film and record any audio from said machines.
Thanks for watching!
and um Ryoma said F you to the people this is a late one but I think this is interesting F you to the people who ignored me on my birthday on Wednesday because a gay lesbian silenced day
What is gay lesbian silence day?
I am gay and I don't even know about it.
Just like everything else in the gay circle, I'm always the last to know.
I think they had this whole high school college demonstration where people would be silent for a few hours and I don't know what the hell it was supposed to signify, but it was supposed to be some sort of gay rights thing.
Okay.
I don't get it either.
I don't get it.
That's not being gay.
Most gay people I know are fucking loud.
You're telling me.
I only can make fun because I am gay.
Whatever.
All right.
I think that's going to do it.
I think we're done with tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio.
We've got a long time here.
We're damn near on four hours now.
So I think it's time for us to stop broadcasting.
So it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
Loki, your final thought.
I have lots of work to do this week.
And I don't know if I'll see you.
Oh, God.
There's one story I forgot.
H2V2.ggl.com H2V2.ggl.com
Yeah, Ryoma clarified here.
They were ignoring people because gays were being ignored or something like that.
When I'm around, I can't be ignored.
How hard is it to ignore?
Andrew, your final thought.
I have fury.
My final thought is time for me to go play more Final Fantasy XI.
Addict.
Shut up, you're not Jamie.
Okay, okay, I'm a WoW addict.
I have no room to talk.
Remember, kids, no live show next week, but tune into the podcast stream.
When you next hear Loki, he will be a married man.
Sucker.
And I will be the only unmarried OLR host.
How sad.
And since, you know, with laws being the way they are, I won't be getting married for a while.
Wah, wah, wah.
Unless I move to Massachusetts.
Oh well, who cares.
Oh well, you're not a sucker, right?
Hey, it just gives me the right to be bitter.
So when I'm especially bitter on the show, I can just go, hey, it's because I'm not married.
Have a good one, everybody.
We'll see you next time.
Stay tuned to the podcast stream.
Two weeks, by the way.
Big announcement on the show.
In fact, maybe before that.
Stay tuned to the website around May 1st-ish.
Right, Loki?
Yes.
We'll tell you this much.
We're launching a new website, and it's a PSP thing.
Yes.
And that's all we'll say.
Yes.
And if you love OLRPSP.com, you're going to love it.
So stay tuned.
Yes.
All right.
Have a super day, everybody.
We'll talk to you later.
And thanks for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting Internet Radio.
Please reconnect to the stream in about 15 seconds to resume... Oh, shit!
I almost forgot the fortune cookie message of the day.
Shit!
It's because DarkSakura's not here to give me the death stare.
Here it is, your fortune cookie message of the day, which I almost forgot.
Damn me.
This is a special moment right now.
We'd like to take this time to tell all the kids at home, send your parents out of the room.
This is a kid's song.
Life's gonna suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up Life's gonna suck when you grow up, it sucks pretty bad right now Hey, if you know the words, sing along!
You're gonna have to mow the lawn, do the dishes, make your bed You're gonna have to go to school until you're seventeen It's gonna seem about three times as long as that
Hey cheer up kids, it gets a lot worse!
You're gonna have to deal with stress, deal with stress, deal with stress You're gonna be a giant mess when you get back from the war Santa Claus does not exist and there's no Easter Bunny You'll find out when you grow up that Drake Bird isn't funny Life's gonna suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up Life's gonna suck when you grow up, it sucks pretty bad right now
You're gonna end up smoking crack On your back, face the back You're gonna end up hooked on smack And then you're gonna die And then you're gonna die
DarkSakura is a damn dirty cheater too.
That song was just in like four weeks ago, I think.
Oh well.
Oh well.
No, it was in last week's pre-show.
That's why it sounds like it was in last week's pre-show, but it wasn't Fortune Cookie not that long ago.
The moral of the story is, it pays to cheat.
You know what, that's one of my favorite Fortune Cookie messages anyway, so I don't care.
I'll play that every week if you kids don't shut up.
Just kidding.
Love ya.
Have a great night, everybody, and reconnect to the stream in about 15 seconds for more Orange Lounge Radio.
