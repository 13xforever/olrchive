Tonight, April 23rd, 2006, Loki spills tentative release dates for Sony games, many companies begin announcing their E3 plans, and Kid Whatever, musician from In The Groove, joins us to talk about the game and his new CD.
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
This is episode number 182 for this April the 23rd, 2006.
My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky, not joining us tonight.
DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers, she is off tonight for her birthday.
And I can say I did attend her birthday festivities.
We went to Dave and Buster's last night in the Bay Area and watched her get mighty drunk.
and it was a good time.
So she's recovering today.
She probably has a little bit of a hangover.
No, I guess she doesn't really get hangovers or at least she claims not to but she's up to no good either way.
And she also gets to be lazy next week because next week we are not going to be having a show because of our other co-host right over there, Loki.
Yes.
What did you do now?
I had to go get married.
That's right.
Loki's getting married next Sunday.
Congratulations in advance.
We're not going to be here next Sunday because Jamie and I are obviously going to the wedding, so we won't be able to do the show.
However, stay tuned to the podcast stream.
We will have something for you guys we're cooking up, but we will not be here live, I'm sorry to say.
However, there will be playing live an old classic episode, maybe something that's been in popular demand for a little while to be replayed now involving a certain karaoke episode.
We'll see.
We'll see.
I'll have to dig it up if I can find it.
I may have to actually talk to one of our people that archived this show, like Misty or Angel or something, see if I can dig it up.
So we'll see.
For the prosperity of the show, I suppose I could give you the recordings.
We are here to talk about video games that you guys really want to know about, try to avoid things that suck.
One thing that the critics thought really sucked was the Silent Hill movie that came out this week.
Of course, we have been talking and talking about this movie for a long time, hyping this up on the show.
Loki, did it deliver?
Did it disappoint?
What did you think?
Well, their excuse was that they couldn't figure out what was going on in the plot.
I don't know.
It seemed pretty straightforward to me.
I don't know.
Yeah, it didn't.
I think the plot was, and of course we're trying to make this spoiler free so let's be good and not spoil this for anybody because not everybody's seen this but I think the plot is open to interpretation especially at the end because there's been arguments on LiveJournal back and forth between me and other people on what the ending really represents and does it mean one thing versus another thing so I think any movie that can get you to talk about it long after you've seen it is a good movie
I think movies are things you should be able to talk about.
Well, I don't know.
There's movies of different entertainment values.
Some movies, like, you know, take Terminator.
Okay, that's just bang, bang, shoot him up.
There's nothing to really talk about.
That's a different type of entertainment.
But, you know, Silent Hill was a different type of film.
What did you think, though, overall?
You like it?
Didn't like it?
It was okay.
It was okay?
Yeah, it was cool.
I don't know.
I haven't really watched that many video game movies, so I can't really say if it's better or worse than any of them.
I would say it's definitely worth seeing.
It's not bad.
I think it was pretty good, actually.
Even for just a horror movie, it was pretty good.
My whole complaint with the whole movie is just towards the end.
It gets a little weird.
PYRAMID HEADS
is the scariest thing in the whole movie.
I mean, seriously.
Because, you know, I think a lot of you guys have heard about one scene in particular, but I won't say it to spoil it for you guys.
But that's not the only, like, scary moment.
I mean, there's another scene that's just, like, really freaky.
And I'll tell you what, the sound when Pyramid Head walks and the sword scraping on the ground, like, it was just awesome.
That was pretty cool.
I thought that the monsters were done very well.
It was very...
Very true to the whole storyline, so that's good.
It was well done.
It wasn't like some crappy, you know... It was just a really crappy movie or anything.
What do you think?
Best video game movie ever?
Well, I don't know.
After all, Double Dragon was pretty good.
It was...
So far, it's pretty good.
I don't know if it's going to be the best ever, but I liked it.
It was definitely a very strong start.
Who cares if the critics don't like it?
Most of the critics didn't know what they were talking about and were just saying stupid stuff.
Granted, the dialogue sucked.
Yeah, the dialogue was my biggest problem with the movie.
We'll give them that.
The plot not being able to be understood...
It was pretty straightforward to me.
I was even looking at it in a sense, how could you confuse this?
I didn't think the plot was nearly as bad as the critics made it out to be.
I don't understand how they could be confused with that stuff.
I personally think they didn't try, or they just didn't care.
Something somebody said in my live journal, which had me thinking a little bit, was the dialogue intentionally bad to be like the games?
Maybe.
There were some parts that was like, huh, why is this like, it seemed like part of a game.
PYRAMID HEAD PYRAMID HEAD
That was fan service.
I didn't need the movie to feel like the video game.
In a way, it did feel like the game.
Everything outside of dialogue, like the fog ambience and the characters were very Silent Hill and the monsters were awesome and all that stuff.
I think it was cool.
I would have liked to have seen less of the cult stuff towards the end and more of just the beginning of the movie.
If they took the beginning of the movie and doubled that
That would have been a really good movie.
Tell me that siren thing isn't the freakiest thing, though.
That was awesome.
It was cool.
Yeah, it just...
I don't know.
Alright.
I think the first monsters that you see were, I thought were the scariest, but they're at least the creepiest, I mean, but I don't know, that's just me.
And again, just for my thoughts, I wasn't like, OMG, best movie ever, and the movie wasn't without its, you know, pretty big flaws, but I thought it was good, and you know, it's really violent, it totally delivers on the violence and blood and gore thing, and it's pretty freaky.
It's a different type of scare.
It's not slasher movie scary, it's like WTF, question mark, exclamation point,
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
Anyway, also joining us tonight, say hello to, make sure the mic's on over there, the 23rd Magus, also known as Andrew.
Yeah, it's been a while.
It has been a little while since you've been on the program.
Well, there's not much else to say about it.
Just been away for a long time.
Sorry, your volume's been pretty bad.
I'm just adjusting you on the fly there.
All right, how's this?
There, much better.
All right, awesome.
Sounds good.
So you used to come on the show a lot back in the old days when we weren't doing the podcast thing, when we were just like a live-only thing.
Yeah, it was...
Big fun.
It was a good time.
Back when the show wasn't like kind of crappy like it is now, when it was just plain crappy back in the day.
It was broke down ghetto Bomani radio.
Exactly.
Well, we don't do the Bomani thing.
Well, I mean, we do.
I mean, we have big music game thing.
We actually have a special guest tonight who's a big part of music games.
Not Bomani, but music games.
And, you know, we still definitely do our tribute once in a while to music games, but we try to think everything.
Yeah, we think as a whole.
Yeah.
Video Game Fans First
Somehow, I think they got reprinted.
I managed to pick up Rez and Guitaroman.
They were marketed as used at a local GameStop.
Yes, I don't know.
They've been having a lot of the older games just suddenly popping up on shelves everywhere.
I have no idea why.
No, Rez would make a good PSP game.
It would.
Alright, speaking of games, I'd like to start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week?
What kind of stuff have you been playing?
What have you been into?
Loki, start us off.
I've been playing, well mainly today, I've been playing Mutant Storm Reloaded or whatever that is.
And that game is pretty cool.
I'm trying to go through the, what was it?
It's not the adventure mode, the other one.
Anyways, so I was trying to get up there.
I'm like...
rank 2,445 or something now because I actually have to play through the game.
I didn't realize you get more points if you play it on black belt and stuff.
So, I've been playing everything I'm up through like, oh man, I want to say like 65 on yellow belt and then I'm just starting to replay them all again on black belt.
The difficulty gets friggin' annoying just in some of the games.
But, um,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and so I crashed into the car and then they win.
I'm like, what the fuck was that?
So it's just ridiculous stuff like that.
The other thing I've been playing, of course, we started doing team games in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and this is where the game starts to fall apart.
Not necessarily in the fact that team games suck on it because team games are really fun and have actually kind of made the whole game new again.
It's just that the programming that they did for the team games is so horrible that you cannot...
Most of the time you can't get them to work.
In fact, a lot of times we'll spawn and you'll be a ball instead of a player.
And you'll have to reboot the whole thing.
The whole thing will crash.
So, you know, big fuck you to Rockstar for really dropping the ball and programming the multiplayer in this game.
It just completely makes it unplayable sometimes.
So, it's weird.
And because we have six players team games and it won't work.
But if you do six players just one-on-one, you know, everyone for themselves, it works fine.
So, that doesn't make any sense at all, but I don't know.
I hope they fix this in the next one.
Otherwise, someone's going to need to be punched in the face.
And then, other than that, I haven't really played too much else.
I tried playing a little bit more Rubble Roses XX, and I don't know.
I'm going to try playing through the game just to get some more achievement points.
That's about it, but, you know.
And, yeah, that's pretty much it.
I've been playing a couple games this week.
I checked out Brain Age on the DS.
Train your brain in minutes a day.
It's different.
It's not your typical kind of game.
I think if you're going in expecting some type of 20 hours to beat type start to finish game, you're going to be a little bit disappointed.
That's not the point behind brain training.
Basically, what it is, is that you've got a lot of little games, like mini-games, that you play, and it's supposed to get you thinking.
It's supposed to get your brain moving.
It's like brain exercises, essentially.
For instance, one of the game is do 20 math problems as fast as you can.
I know that sounds a little cheesy, but it's actually kind of fun, you know, to like get your brain moving.
And you have to be a little bit nerdy, I think, to like it though, because if you're just like, if you're like, ew, math, you're probably not going to get as big of a thrill out of it.
Which is cool because it recognizes your handwriting, although if you have crappy handwriting like me, you're going to have some problems.
For instances, I write my eights, like I don't write a big curve, like, you know, like a big loop.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The other problem the game has is with voice recognition.
There's another game where what you're supposed to do is that the name of a color will show up on the screen, like it'll say red, but the word will actually be written either in the same color or a different color.
And you're supposed to say not the word, but the color that the word is written in.
So it like messes with you a little bit because even though it might say red, it's in black text.
You have to say black.
So you get either red, black, yellow, or blue.
Well, here's the thing.
The DS has a real hard time recognizing me saying blue.
Like I'll say blue and it goes, try again.
Blue, try again.
Blue!
And it still doesn't work.
And I'm not the only one that had this problem.
My roommate had this problem.
I've listened to other people review this game have the same problem.
I have the fix for you.
This is how to get the game to recognize what you're saying.
And I know this is going to sound really wrong.
It's going to sound really, really wrong, but it works.
If you don't believe me, try it.
Instead of saying blue, say brew, and it works.
Just change your L's to an R, and it works.
I'm not even kidding.
Why am I somehow not surprised?
That is completely racist, bro.
You know what?
Do it.
If you're having problems with the game, recognize you saying blue.
Try, brew, brew, brew, and it'll work.
It completely worked for me.
It has not misread me saying blue once yet, ever since I started talking.
I thought having Phoenix Wright not recognizing objection was bad.
Exactly.
Alright, so the game is fun.
It kind of reminds me of those old puzzle books that you can get at the supermarket, like Games Magazine, I think was the one that would always have little puzzles in it, and the penny press and all those little things.
If you like those types of things, because Sudoku's in the game too, and Sudoku is really big in those magazines, I think you're really going to like this.
and I think it's just kind of a it's really a groundbreaking game because you know it's been advertised in Time Magazine and they're showing it on TV in these different style commercials I think they're really trying to reach a different audience with this game so it's gonna be very interesting to see how well this game does because they are not trying to reach your typical gamer and I'll tell you most
and typical gamers, quote unquote.
Probably not the folks that listen to this show, but like when I say gamers, like those that play like Madden and Halo shoot-em-ups exclusively that don't play a lot of the other stuff, probably aren't going to like this.
This is definitely geared towards a different audience, but I think it's a good investment.
$20 is a pretty good price for a DS game.
And you know what?
You get Sudoku, which is, you know, really popular and all that stuff.
Even though it's a little bit overrated, it'll keep you busy for a long time.
or just buy it used when it, you know, you'll probably see it used in a few weeks.
For 15.
Yeah.
So I got my, I would like to say I got my brain age down to 21, which is really, as low as you can go is 20.
But the first time I tested because it had problems picking up blue, I had to go, blue, blue.
My brain age was like 54 or something the first time.
It was kind of sad.
Anyway, heading on over to www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat to hear from our chatters.
Let's see, DidYouLoseASock says, I'm dyslexic and I write all my letters backwards.
The letters don't appear backwards.
I start and finish writing a letter different than normal people.
So yeah, those of you that have a different style of writing things might be in for a shock.
Now, I write my A's kind of funny.
I don't write my A's like most people do.
Most people do like an O with a tail.
I draw mine like a printed letter A, like an upside down E. That's how I write my A's.
And the game recognizes that, so at least I have that.
So the game isn't totally stupid.
But some of you guys that have weird handwriting things are going to have some challenges there, so be careful.
And BlackWolf, who also does a show over there on All Games Radio, BlackWolf says, Sudoku is just the side game.
It's not part of the main Brain Age gameplay.
No, it's not a part of the main gameplay, but it does kind of fit along with that same theme of, you know, exercise your brain.
And when you go into it, it says, Sudoku is a great way to exercise the cortex part of your brain, all that stuff.
So,
It kind of, even though it's like a side game, it fits into the same idea.
So it's, you know, a little bonus.
Which makes the advertising of the game appropriate.
I have that little sticker that says Sudoku included.
Woo!
Alright.
Also, the other game I played.
This might surprise you.
I love Final Fantasy XI.
You know this, right?
I talk about it a lot on this program.
I've invested far too many hours into this game.
It's an MMO that sucked away my life.
Okay?
I'm going to give Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 a negative review.
Here's why.
Final Fantasy XI on 360 is not going to work for your typical Xbox 360 gamer.
I feel like I have to give this a negative review because your typical 360 gamer is going to get so pissed off trying to play this game.
Because there are so many hurdles that you have to clear.
And for a PC gamer, which is where I started the game, it's okay.
And for...
PlayOnlineHurdle.com
And I understand it's necessary to get the game to be compatible with PC and PlayStation 2.
I'm not an idiot.
I know why it's there.
But I'm saying it really cripples the game.
I'm telling you, you cannot turn on this game and just go and play.
It takes, literally, I'm going to time it.
We're going to put a video up on the website.
I'm going to time it and show you that it takes well over a minute from the time you turn on your Xbox for you to actually log into the game.
That is really annoying.
I'm sorry, there's no easy way to just get in there and go.
You've got to go through that ugly play online thing, which really, they need some type of quick button or something where I just go right into Final Fantasy XI and start with my primary character or something.
Here's the other thing.
I was so excited to play Final Fantasy XI on my HDTV because, you know, widescreen.
And don't get me wrong, the game is very, very pretty.
And it looks very nice and it's very colorful.
The text is blurry!
The text is blurry on an HDTV.
You cannot make out the number of hit points my character has in the corner.
Yes, I've tried adjusting my TV settings, contrast, brightness, all that stuff.
I didn't have to adjust it for any other Xbox game I own.
And even in adjusting it, I can't get it to look the way it does on my computer.
It's annoying.
I couldn't believe it.
So I...
Even though I might once in a while play Final Fantasy XI on my Xbox 360 and I'm kind of screwed where I can't take it back really, I can't recommend this game because I think people that play Xbox 360 that want to get into role-playing games are honestly going to want something more like Oblivion.
Yes, Andrew?
Speaking of which, how many massive RPGs does the Xbox 360 have?
I can name one.
Oblivion.
No, no.
Oblivion is not a massive game.
It's just a massive RPG.
Okay, sorry.
Huge RPG.
Not massively multiplayer.
Just huge RPG.
Right.
Personally, I don't think the Xbox 360 caters to that type of gamer, at least not yet.
I mean, I've done a little bit of lurking on forums for the 360 version of Final Fantasy XI, and these people who have played the demo are just pissed off that it's not the fast type of game that they're used to, like, say, Halo.
It's not what the people who buy a 360 would typically enjoy.
So the community might take a hit on that.
and also the thing that we should all be pissed off about, other than the fact, granted it's not $60, it's still $50, which is still way too much, the fact they didn't do anything with it, the graphics don't look any better, the resolutions aren't any higher.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Compress the guide button and get custom soundtracks from CDs they've ripped or their computer if they took a little extra effort.
And the fact that you could do live chat and the whole Xbox 360 interface is kind of neat, although I imagine most PC players are already doing Ventrilo anyway, so it doesn't matter.
But I think the price is actually right, because considering you get the expansion with the game and everything, I think the price is fair.
I think $50 is a fair price for the game.
I've been reading stories on the internet where people are pissed off that there's an extra $12.95 fee to go with the game.
It's an MMO, dumbass.
Seriously.
I couldn't believe it.
I don't know if I was reading on Joystick, Kotaku, one of those sites.
Yeah, it was just some retard that didn't realize.
It says right on the box in the upper left-hand corner, required internet connection, monthly fee.
It says right on the box in small print.
Anarchy Online, Guild Wars,
I can name the third one, RuneScape
It sucks, but it's popular.
Or Ragnarok on pirated servers, which is what most people are doing.
I guess I forgot to mention.
Oh, God, now the chat room is just flooding there.
Guild Wars.
Yeah, I already said Guild Wars.
MapleStory.
Oh, I forgot about MapleStory.
Okay, fair enough.
All right, so maybe there's a few.
But come on, the popular ones, World of Warcraft, Lineage, EverQuest, Final Fantasy, they all have monthly fees.
Guild Wars is probably the most popular one that doesn't have a monthly fee.
And Guild Wars is a good game.
I like Guild Wars.
But anyway, I can't believe that some guy was stupid to not think there was going to be this extra monthly fee.
Even Phantasy Star Online on the Xbox had a monthly fee.
And it's a bitch to cancel, might I add.
They will not just stop billing you when you stop playing.
It's pretty annoying.
Anyway, so I'm sorry.
I think the only way folks are going to like this game on 360 is if they know what they're in for.
And there's probably Final Fantasy XI fans all ready to write me an angry email.
Okay, well, look, I play Final Fantasy a lot too.
I knew what I was kind of in for on the Xbox, but I'm trying to look at this as a game that people who have an Xbox 360 and maybe have never played an MMO before...
because Microsoft fans really probably haven't played an MMO before.
If you're exclusively an Xbox or Xbox 360 owner, you probably haven't played an MMO before unless you played Phantasy Star.
But you certainly haven't played anything about Final Fantasy XI.
This is not the most user-friendly introduction of these games.
It's probably going to turn a lot of people off to it in the future.
All right.
All right.
I like this.
Chat room comments here.
BlackWolf again says, Dear Sky, your review made me a sad panda.
Love, Sephiroth420Rules.
If you think MMOs with people named Sephiroth are bad, log into Final Fantasy sometime.
You'll see Sephiroth and Sephiroth.
Legolas, Drist, everyone.
You'll see Tidus and Una, Unia, Unilesca.
Change one letter from a popular character and you got it.
Everything.
Everything.
Alright, so, sorry guys, I think the only way I would recommend Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 to you is if you've played it on another system and you already know what you're in for, because you better be patient.
And you better make sure you have a USB keyboard.
And if you don't believe me, a timed video will be coming to OLRPSP.com very soon.
You should see the installation time, let alone... It was an hour to install, and then that doesn't even count the patching.
Yeah, so... I remember the beta, and then trying to find how to take the beta off the hard drive.
That was great.
You know what, though?
On PC, it didn't bother me, because I expect that type of thing from PC games.
That's why I think Final Fantasy XI is a great game on PC, and I think it's passable on PlayStation 2, because PlayStation 2 doesn't have any nice Xbox Live-type service, so I think people had to expect something like that.
But Xbox 360?
People are going to be in for a shock.
Okay, I'm done.
I don't want to talk about Final Fantasy XI anymore.
Andrew, what have you been playing?
How was your gaming week?
Oh, how was my gaming year?
No.
No, just this week.
All right, all right.
I've been getting into guitar here a little bit more.
I've got two more songs to go on Expert.
Just can't pass Bark in the Moon or Cowboys from Hell, but it's been a lot of progress.
I've been playing World of Warcraft, happily almost 57 Rogue on Maelstrom.
Doing a couple of Black Rod.
See?
Blue, brew, brew.
Blackrock Depths runs, 2 of 8 on Shadowcraft, trying to get myself in a high-end rating guild once I hit 60.
Been playing some Rez, trying to get into that, can't pass level 5, but the game is just uber trippy.
I'm ashamed of myself that I didn't get into it the first time it came around.
Actually, there's not much else that I can really say about how I was my week, but World of Warcraft is awesome and is getting better all the time.
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
against the raid boss of the expansion.
I still want the panda people.
Pandarins?
Pandarins probably won't make it.
I know, but I still want it.
Oh, yeah.
Isn't it nice to want it?
Hopefully they'll announce some NPCs, Pandarins, over in Outland.
You think we'll find out at E3?
You think Blizzard's just sitting on it for E3 now?
I know that they were definitely holding out on it until April Fool's Day so they could unveil...
That was a little silly.
That was a little silly.
All right, well, just looking at some more comments in our chat room here over at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
Click on chat.
YouWillBowToMe says, 50% of MMO names have Sephiroth in them.
The other 50% have 420 in them.
That's very true.
Let's see.
Who said the thing about 69?
Oh, DJPooEater says, 69 is always a popular name to use as well.
So, very.
What are other popular MMO names I see all the time?
Yeah, Legolas is always like Dan L. Name Legolas.
We're going to move on and get into some gaming news this week.
First to start off, we're going to talk about release dates, right Loki?
Of course.
Loki got some more release dates he wants to share with you guys.
Remember that these are all tentative.
But first, if you still don't believe us on these release date things, two things got confirmed this week.
First off, Nintendo Power's recent issue, their cover, and what's on the cover of the latest Nintendo Power?
Castlevania, Portrait of... whatever Portrait of Ruin, for those people that said Orange Lounge Radio is pulling that name out of their ass Nope, there it is, confirmed by Nintendo Power Portrait of Ruin, and what was the other thing?
There was the Tony Hawk game you mentioned like a month ago Tony Hawk, Downhill Jam, it was part of the Destination PlayStation news I did on those mini-podcasts that we had And apparently no one paid attention to any of that stuff Because they just released all that same info as new this week
Well, we're a no-name site, remember.
Yeah, including the PSP 50 Cent game, the Eragon game.
Let me see what was on my list here.
The Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which I think at the time I was calling it Marvel Legends.
That was the working name.
And what else was there?
Oh, the gun for PSP.
Um...
What else do we have here?
I don't know.
I think that's pretty much all the major stuff that they're talking about.
Oh, Miami Vice.
They were talking about that coming out.
Well, let me reaffirm a few more things since I said them before and now people are starting to listen a little bit.
Here's a few more that they still have not mentioned.
Okay, so granted we have Tony Hawk.
These are all new this week?
Well, this is stuff I said before.
Okay, so before we said Tony Hawk's downhill jam for the revolution.
Okay, well that's still coming.
Marvel Ultimate Alliance is coming on the Revolution, probably at launch.
So that should be good.
We're also having on the PSP, Pimp My Ride the Game.
Remember, I said this before.
Pimp My Ride the Game coming to the Xbox 360 and PSP, among other joy and rapture.
So remember that.
Pimp My Ride the Game coming.
Call of Duty is going to be coming to the PSP.
at some point as well.
And of course, Call of Duty 3 on the PS3 and Xbox 360 and all that stuff.
Not a big surprise there.
All right, tell us the new ones already.
I want to hear the new ones that you posted this week on the site and no one noticed.
Okay, well anyways, the ones I posted, starting off with Itoy Play 3, which is coming out.
Okay, get to the good stuff.
Okay, SOCOM combined assault.
This was also announced on other sites too.
They're talking about this game coming out and that's actually supposed to be coming out on November 15th.
Gangs of London, which is the Getaway series spinoff, that's coming also on November 15th.
SOCOM Fireteam Bravo 2, also on the 15th on the PSP.
The next Ratchet and Clank game coming to the PSP, that's actually in 2007 on Valentine's Day.
And the day after that, God of War 2 will be coming out on February 15th, which is awesome.
and there are some sports games as well NBA 07 coming out in October on PS2 Rogue Galaxy on October 4th and then if you're an ATV fan ATV Off-Road Fury 4 coming out on PlayStation 2 September 27th and ATV Off-Road Fury Pro on the PSP on October 18th which is going to be pretty cool then from Square Enix
Valkyrie Profile Lenneth Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Cerebus Final Fantasy XII for the United States September 12th Release dates always subject to change Especially with Squeenix
Yeah, so this is what is currently... Stuff could move around, but this is going to be the information everyone has right now until we hear otherwise.
Well, good job, Loki.
Keep your ears out there for any other release dates coming up to E3.
There's another one, too.
I think in September, LEGO Star Wars 2, the original trilogy, is coming out.
That was the other one I thought was kind of cool.
But I'm just saying, you know, we had...
A lot of the stuff from Destination PlayStation.
See, no one was reporting on it because no one went to Destination PlayStation.
It's only a retail-only event.
Well, keep your ears out there in the retail scene so we can, you know, before people catch on that, you know, that's where we're getting our news.
Anyway, let's get into some other news tonight.
Talk about games that are officially announced by the company, even though we all knew it was coming.
Guitar Hero 2 was officially announced.
It's going to be coming out.
Guitar Hero 2 was announced earlier, I guess a press conference or something like that, by...
Red Octane.
And of course there's even a little interview that you can look at over on IGN.
They have a whole little thing going on there.
And they're going to be able to do the lead guitar, rhythm guitar, and bass guitar.
And so they have it separated into all those different tracks as well.
And there's going to be, I guess, the multiplayer as well where you can kind of do the separate things going on.
I'm just going to
Really quickly derailed this train.
Before anyone starts calling this innovative, let me remind you Guitar Freaks has been doing this for years with the whole bass track.
In a way, in a way.
About 55 songs are supposed to be in the game.
They're saying also more difficult songs for folks that have mastered the original.
And, of course, the multiplayer co-op, which I also hinted at before, that will be coming as well.
No song hints, but we're imagining there's going to be a demo D3 that ought to give some of that away.
That and they're also saying that now that they're able, that it's had such a success with the original, they're able to get bigger name bands now before they were like, huh?
That's good.
Maybe a multi-platform at some point would be nice, but don't hold your breath because that means I have to do new controllers, but we'll see.
Of course, it will work with the old controller.
They're not going to screw you into getting a new controller, which is good news, I'm sure.
So, we shall see.
I'm hoping for some GWAR myself.
I would love to see that in Guitar Hero, complete with the costumed people, like, you know, just
Crowdsurfing and all that would be hot.
Loki, another confirmation of something I believe we rumored last week, correct?
Yeah, Sony has actually lowered the price of the PS2 down to $129.99 retail.
And that's not really much of a surprise.
And it's effective as of, you know, last week, basically.
And, you know,
and so on.
Awesome.
So, no $99 yet, though, huh?
Give it time.
You've got probably Christmas around PS3 launch.
About the time.
You know what's interesting, though?
$129 is also the cost of a DS, because I lost that bet with Extifer.
Today was six months since we'd made a bet, and I had to buy his DS today, and that's how much I paid for it.
$129.
So, DS will cost you just as much as a PlayStation.
That is until the next DS price drop, which I'm sure is
Maybe around the time the light comes out?
I don't know.
Probably.
Who knows?
Who knows?
Big, big rumor going around this week.
This is from a site, pro-g.co.uk.
Is Xbox Live Arcade going to get MAME games as well as Sega games?
That could be very interesting.
There's a Microsoft source, but of course they can't say who, that says, quote, Xbox Live Arcade has seen some pretty serious deal-making in this first quarter.
It's been a real priority.
The deal-making has been a no-brainer for everyone we've spoken to, and aside from a few licensing issues with existing products, Xbox Live Arcade is going to smash Nintendo's virtual console to pieces.
Keep in mind, that's coming from a Microsoft source, so it's a little bit biased.
Well, here the quote goes on.
I think this is interesting.
You've heard of the MAME, or I'm sorry, you've heard of MAME, right?
We're just doing a legal version of MAME, meaning that all the game owners get paid and the users get quality product based around a community.
Imagine the biggest arcade in the world just a thousand times bigger.
It'll have as many machines as we can possibly get, all with score rankings and other community stuff.
It's not a secret that MAME was massive for hackers of the original Xbox, and the pull in sales of retro game packs on current machines is still really high.
If this is taken and put under the right noses, it should become the biggest thing in mainstream
Hardcore Gamer Crossover in the industry
They're also saying that Sega's going to jump on board.
Sega games will be included in a major way.
It's a surprising addition to the deal and will include games that Nintendo will also be selling.
The Nintendo deal, not exclusive.
Again, take that with a big grain of salt there.
The MAME thing is a little hard for me to get.
I can see maybe using some of the same code.
I just couldn't see them calling it MAME on the Xbox.
Hello, they've already got arcade games on there.
They're the same thing.
I mean, look, Gauntlet.
Smash TV, Robotron.
But those games take a little extra that MAME doesn't.
I mean, because those games have co-op and they have, you know, the Xbox Live achievements and rankings and things that MAME doesn't exactly have programmed into it.
I think it would be stupid for them to put like thousands of games on there.
I mean, I just... I don't because I think that's what Nintendo plans to do.
Slowly but surely.
I don't know.
MAME doesn't seem like a good way to do it.
I think the idea is there, like they're going to be bringing more arcade games.
I don't think it's called MAME.
They're not going to call it MAME.
I don't know.
But that's, again, I know what it's like, and you know what it's like to be on the other side when you're the site reporting the rumor and have everybody going, oh, you guys are liars.
So I don't know.
I think the Sega thing is true.
I don't see why that wouldn't be true.
It makes complete sense to me.
Whatever.
As long as they put good games on there.
Where's all my gal's pen of games?
That's what we need on Xbox Live Arcade.
Problem for Microsoft, though.
People are still going to use MAME.
People are still going to hack their Xboxes and put MAME on there.
People are still going to use MAME on their PCs.
People are still going to do that.
Most people that probably have a 360 probably own a PC.
And they'll be like, wow, MAME on my 360.
Uh, no, I think I'll just play it for free.
Wait a minute, though.
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Because Gauntlet is still a great selling game because many of those people are also achievement point whores.
So they will buy the game to get 200 achievement points or however many they can squeeze out of it.
Huh?
Yeah, and by the way, getting achievement points out of Xbox Live arcade games is retarded because it's freaking hard.
Comments from our chatroom, Orange Lounge Radio, click on chat.
The time point ratio sucks.
Phoenix Rising says, I want Neo Geo on live.
And also says, Blaster Master for live.
Ooh, that's a good one.
Fireboma says, the Simpsons arcade game is a classic.
Ooh, that's something that definitely should be on Xbox Live.
That would be awesome.
Well, they were talking about the Ninja Turtles game.
Maybe.
Ooh, that would be cool.
We shall see.
I'd play that.
All right.
Moving on, going to the next topic.
Loki.
Anyways, um, I can't believe Mame freaking retarded.
Anyways, um, so yes, there's this whole thing that was actually out in one of my nice retail industry magazines talking about this brand new Microsoft portable system that is in the works right now.
Codename the X-Player.
It's expected to arrive in 2007, possibly something they announce at E3.
Anyways, um,
The X-Player is in development in Redmond, Washington, according to Dean Takahashi, author of the upcoming Spider-Works Press book, The Xbox 360 Uncloaked.
Takahashi previously wrote inside the Xbox for Prima.
It basically has good sources inside Microsoft.
Basically, they're kind of confirming the original rumor, saying Jay Allard and his team...
X-Player with this iTunes-like store.
I don't know.
Interesting.
But it says Microsoft recently signed a deal with Epic Records, which is to bring their music exclusively to Xbox Live.
Actually, their music videos.
I think we've been seeing that, actually, with the stuff that they've had on live right now.
So it should be interesting.
But this is coming straight out of, well, not a magazine most people would be reading, but let's see here.
Home Media Retailing for all those wonderful video retailers out there.
Sorry, I had my mic off.
I was going to say, interesting, is that just another fancy name for the origami?
Because that's what our chat room seems to think.
No, it's not the origami.
Something completely different.
It hasn't come out yet.
2007 for this.
And this is something that I've heard earlier was being worked on.
So if you're looking for a bomb to be dropped at E3, here it is.
Interesting.
I know.
I find it interesting that in every article like that, it says it's going to be a PSP killer.
They're going to compete directly with Sony.
You notice they're not... Microsoft hasn't tried to compete directly with Nintendo, whether they think Nintendo is just beneath them or just not on the league.
They always try to go for the brute force approach and try to out...
Outpower the other systems That's because Microsoft's trying to create a Trojan horse entertainment system That's basically going to get into your house You buy the 360 because you want to play games on it But oh look, now it also records TV Oh look, now I can download videos from the internet Oh look, now I can download movies from the internet And oh look, now it's the center of my entertainment in my household Basically kind of what Sony's doing also Except being less shady Well, I don't know what less shady about it, but
you know slightly less shady about it um that's what they kind of want to do with the PSP because well the PSP UMD movie sucked and that didn't really take off but um
This whole e-distribution thing that they're planning on doing with the PSP, well, sure, Microsoft wants to get a piece of that action.
I mean, why not?
They think that they can defeat Sony in the console world.
Why not try to defeat them in the handheld market?
And to be honest, they don't really see the Nintendo DS as a threat because it's not playing movies or music or anything like that.
So it's just a gaming system.
Well, you've got two companies who market their products as able to do everything, and they have one...
Thanks for watching!
It's not very easy to browse with, let me put it that way.
You can use it.
It's great.
Not enough people designed just for the PSP.
I think there's a lot to be milked out of the PSP.
And I think you're going to see some pretty innovative things coming soon.
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
Oh, yeah.
All right.
Anyway.
And then, yeah, comments from our chat room.
Jada2006 says, OLR PSP looks awesome on Firefox.
Well, look, we don't design it for Firefox.
Speaking of which, OLRPSP does have a brand new video that I've uploaded.
Straight from the bachelor party is me playing Mario Kart GP.
And to be honest, what you see on the video is all I remember of it because I don't remember actually playing the game.
I've just watched the video.
Yeah, Gizm just asked about that in chat.
That video is up.
It just went up before the show started tonight, the Mario Kart video.
So check that out.
Did you lose a sock?
Comment from our chat room.
You can't have the origami in the X player.
Microsoft is backing the origami or the UMPC so much.
Why would they back both?
Because that one's a PC, this is an actual video game console.
Interesting.
Other comments in the chatroom.
YouWillBowToMe says, $50 says the X-Playo will be the size of a fucking brick.
And SpiritSnare says, $60 the X-Playo will be big.
Play on the word big there.
Like big as in, you know, brick.
Here's my other question is, what will G4 think of this?
Who cares?
Because it has X-Playing.
Well, Fireboma thinks it'll be the great repetitive jokes and sarcasm from Morgan Webb and Adam Sessler trying to piss you off more and more until you get better just as you can stop playing.
But you know what?
We're complete.
You know what?
I forgot who's going to dominate the market.
The brand new Phantom.
No, not the Phantom.
N-Gage 2.0
The pile of crap.
It's a big, smelly, engaged boot.
Big, smelly, engaged boot.
So bring your hazmat suits.
Yes, Loki, DarkSakura, and I are going to E3 this year, and we will be bringing you extensive coverage.
You don't even know what we've got planned for you guys.
I really hope you guys are satisfied with what we're bringing you this year.
We're bringing you more than daily podcasts this year.
Let's just put it this way.
It's going to be great.
We're excited.
All right, moving on.
Let's see, wanted to go to this story.
This is something that's been floating around the internet.
It originally started over at IGN.
Again, people feel the need to put together a top ten list, but this one's a little bit funny.
It's a top ten worst in-game quotes of all time.
Before I read any off the list, what would you guys think?
Die, Monster, you don't belong in this world.
Die, Monster from Castlevania.
What do you think, Loki?
The truck have started to move.
The truck have started to move from Metal Gear.
Well, here it is, their top ten.
Shine Get from Super Mario Sunshine.
Number nine, A Winner Is You from Pro Wrestling.
Number eight, The Donkey Kong Rap from Donkey Kong 64.
All right, all right.
Number seven, You Can't Give It Up, Triumph or Die from Street Fighter Alpha 3.
Number six, I Feel Asleep from Metal Gear.
Metal Gear.
5.
Yo Gangsta, get ready to gangbang from Busta Groove 4.
You were doomed as soon as you lost the ability to love from Castlevania Symphony of the Night 3.
Jill, why don't you, the master of unlocking, take this lockpick from Resident Evil 2.
I am Error from Zelda II The Adventures of Link 1.
All your base are belong to us.
Of course.
What about Are You Enjoy?
That is not on the list.
What is that one game on MAME?
Speaking of MAME, there's nothing like Frying Over the Jungle or something like that.
Brad or somebody was showing me that game not that long ago.
I'm sure people in the chat room will light up with it or on email.
But yeah, there's that one too that I think about.
I see a notable lack of the president has been kidnapped by ninjas.
Are you a bad enough dude to save the president?
Oh, there you go.
That's just bad dialogue, not necessarily.
I'm a bad enough dude.
Yes, there was a big E3 email that went out, and one of the things on there was something mentioning The Revolution.
And what was it, you may ask?
Well, it's going to be a flight game put out by Hudson Soft, and of course, we can only speculate what that's going to be like, but it should be fun, at least.
Of course, more Revolution stuff going to be shown at E3, you know, playable demos of Red Steel and that type of thing, but...
Always looking for more innovative stuff.
Maybe this is the next Pilotwings.
To be honest, I don't remember Hudson's off putting out Pilotwings, so I doubt that.
Didn't Hudson have something to do, though, with Smash Bros.
Melee?
Maybe, I want to say.
That was Hal Labs, not Hudson.
Well, anyways, basically they said you're going to be taking this guy's way that you've never experienced before on any home console using the Revolution's gesture system.
which I don't remember what the gesture system is but I imagine it has something to do with the controller built into their innovative controller Hudson's new flight game allows total plane control as players pilot their planes through various acrobatic flight maneuvers ranging from sky artistry to bomb drops alright they should have like a paper airplane controller attachment or something something innovative there
Yeah, a little different.
Alright, this is the part of the show where we would have done the mailbag.
However, DarkSakura is not here.
Thanks for watching!
We have some pretty funny listeners.
Actually, because we leave comments on people's journals, and we have about four pictures that we cycle through.
We're trying to add a couple more to be original, but some people have actually been parroting those pictures and then reposting them back on our MySpace, which has been pretty funny, so we appreciate that sense of humor.
I'm going to read a message I got here, and I'm not sure the guy's real name.
It's Classy Plastic Lumber.
Plastic Lumber is his display name right now.
You guys rock.
But yeah, I've been listening to your show since the PSP got the RSS feature, and I'm just now trying to listen in live.
I have the Java chat working well, and I'm still working on the live stream, so hopefully I'll listen in on Sunday, and you should see me in the chat.
And he gives his nickname there, and let me see, did he make it into chat?
He did not make it into chat, so unfortunately he failed.
So here's a little help on how to listen to our show live, for those of you guys that want to do so.
Head on over to www.orangehauntrader.com, and there's actually a little picture with the Live365 logo, and if you click on that...
on Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
That's how you can tune into us live.
Keep in mind, we actually go live at 5.30 and we can only have 50 slots for people to listen live.
We only have 50 slots.
And that's been filling up lately.
So we're looking at alternatives on how we can get more slots without having to pay an assload.
So that's going to be coming soon, hopefully.
But for right now...
DarkSakura.com
So you can listen to that, and then we're live.
And we're here from 6 o'clock till about 8 o'clock, 8.30, whenever we finish.
And then we do a bonus live show called The Afterbirth, which is just, it's insanity.
We don't even really talk about games.
We just talk about, it's dick and fart jokes and other fun stuff, whatever we feel like.
So tune in for that.
It's a good time.
Alright, so again, if you want to send us an actual email, it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and maybe we'll read some of those on whatever we do next week, because I think we're going to do like a mini-show or something, even though we won't be here live, and then definitely we'll get all caught up on that when we come back.
I want to say May 1st is that show?
No, I guess a little after.
It's going to be the one right before E3, May 7th is when we'll be back.
It'll be our big E3 preview show, so look forward to that.
Yeah, alright.
Moving on, let's go back over to Loki, who is going to tell us about a very popular series getting a sequel.
Yes, Command & Conquer 3, it's Hiberian Wars.
It's been officially announced by EA, and basically kind of picking up where the last game left off.
It takes place in 2047, and will feature the latest in RTS technology.
Also featuring the GDI, the Brotherhood of Nod.
Just looks pretty...
Pretty cool.
And I'm a huge Command & Conquer fan.
I really hoped they'd bring it over to the 360, especially Red Alert.
I loved Red Alert.
But anyways, so that should be coming soon.
Hopefully we'll see that at E3.
Hope I get to check it out.
And it looks pretty cool.
Alright.
Oh, it's coming out in 2007 for Windows PC.
So.
Look for that, Command & Conquer fan.
That's a series I just couldn't get into.
I understand why people love it.
It's just a certain genre of game I don't really play.
You know what, though?
I loved it for a different reason other than the fact that I loved it because you can customize it.
Because you can actually mod it using this thing called the rules.ini file and I can make my own custom troops that were really powerful and stuff and just completely cheat in the game.
But it made it fun because you could do that.
You could send that file to somebody else, play online and play with those customized troops.
And I thought that was really cool, the whole customization part of it.
But
NAMCO BANDAI
Project Gotham Racing 3
You know, I mean, just that much better.
And that's pretty bad if that's a first-gen game and they're already doing what Project Gotham did.
Easy.
I mean, I don't know.
We'll see.
I think it's going to be awesome.
And I'm looking forward to it.
I didn't see... I loved Ridge Racer 6.
Granted, they haven't changed anything since Ridge Racer 4.
Or even maybe before that, but...
So what?
You know, it's still the same game, it's good, it's fun.
Burnout, haven't changed anything in Burnout except for the cars that have bad AI.
Not my favorite racer on the 360, but a solid one, and a long, you know, respected series.
It sort of makes sense that Namco is going full circle with Ridge Racer 7 being a launch title for the PS3.
Ridge Racer Vision 2010
So check that out.
That'll be just a couple weeks.
We're like, what, two weeks away from E3?
By the way, if you do own Ridge Racer 6 for the 360, I swear to God, you gotta constantly watch that marketplace.
There was more cars to download.
They literally have over like 60 downloads for Ridge Racer 6.
And most of them are free.
All of the cars are free.
I've downloaded like 30-some cars for this thing.
I mean, it's excellent.
You really need to check it out if you haven't yet.
and by God, by now, it should be used for pretty cheap.
I mean, it was one of the launch titles that no one liked.
It's definitely worth it.
Wait a minute, you're saying no one liked it?
Okay, it was at the very bottom of the list as far as popularity goes.
I thought Amp 3 was the least selling title.
No, no, Amp 3, I think, didn't even... It was number one in Japan.
It was the number one launch title in Japan, but in the United States, it just bombed, which I don't understand.
It didn't look bad.
It wasn't like, you know... I thought it was a pretty good game.
It's fine, it's fine.
It's a solid game, let's put it that way.
Alright, speaking about E3 coming up in a couple weeks.
Loki, news is starting to get out.
Who's showing what?
Huge emails went out to the attendees this week, right?
Yes, of course.
They have the big, you know, kind of like showing, basically advertising some of the new properties that we're going to see there this year.
Some basic ones I've got to mention.
Elvion, which is one of the 360 games that looked really sweet using the Unreal 3 engine.
Desperate Housewives Diet Queen
One of those educational games, I guess.
Okay.
Or die trying.
This one's interesting, though.
They're actually creating Video Game Tycoon, where you get to be a video game design company.
So that one's kind of neat.
That's cute.
Some other things, Bomberman X-Zero.
Oh, wait.
We talked about that before.
Oh, gee, where did I hear that one already?
And Rengoku 2.
Yeah, we talked about that, too.
Funny.
Silent Hill fans will be interested to know that there's going to be a mobile version coming to cell phones.
Same with Hellboy.
No, they won't, because cell phone games suck.
We'll tell that to the people that own the N-Gage.
Okay, N-Gage owners, cell phone games suck.
Get a real system.
Super Pac-Man is being released by Namco, which no surprise there.
Of course, they're also working on Dragon Spirit, which should be interesting, and Snoopy and the Red Baron.
I guess that's kind of neat.
The only decent cell phone game I've ever played is Sudoku, and that's because it's Sudoku, it's hard to fuck that up.
This one sounded kind of interesting when I read the little thing on it.
R2 Beat, being developed by this company called Seed9 Entertainment, and it's going to combine, it's an online rhythm action racing game.
So, I guess it's basically kind of combining both music beat and extreme speed.
So it sounds like if
I don't know, Amplitude or whatever was a racing game?
I don't know, it might be kind of neat.
King of Fighters 2006 coming from SNK and a whole bunch of Metal Slug crap including the Metal Slug collection which I thought they were all the same anyways but yeah, that's basically it.
Alright, things to look forward to at E3.
Expect a full report on the Diet Revolution?
What was that called?
Diet Girl.
Oh, can't wait to play that.
Yes, that can be maybe my subtitle on the show in the future.
If you'd rather not hear about new stuff, but you're still living in the retro gaming phase, then you'll be happy to know.
Or if you bought Oblivion for the 360 and just loved it, and you want to know a little more about the series history, head on over to TheElderScrolls.com, because you know what?
The original Elder Scrolls arena game
Star Siege Tribes
Exactly.
Alright, Loki.
Now, if you don't like your gaming free, but you like to spend a little more money, you might be able to buy a super special upgrade coming to the 360 soon, right?
Yeah.
Like a $100 HD DVD drive.
That'll be external.
Costs about $100.
Supposed to be shown at E3.
Why?
This is interesting to me because didn't HD DVD players just come out for $1,000?
Yes.
And now they're saying it's only going to be $100.
That was Blu-ray, I thought.
But yeah, I don't understand why they're releasing this.
For one, I don't understand why they're releasing it as an external drive because that would look ugly as hell on a 360.
And I don't think it has the bandwidth through USB to do it, so I don't know how they're planning on pulling it across unless it's going to kind of slap on top maybe where the hard drive goes or something to run it SATA or something.
I don't know.
But...
Also kind of related in the same article, they're talking about 100GB hard drive is supposed to be shown at E3 as well.
No price and date available.
And also the premium pack will be dropped $100 to $299 retail in October.
And the core system will be $80 less, which is the other story.
I can see that happening because they've got to compete with the PS3 when it comes out.
I don't know about... I don't believe the $100 mark for the system.
$100 seems really, really low.
I would have to see... We'd have to see about that, because that's kind of... I don't know.
That's going to really screw all those other HD DVD standalone players, but then again, maybe that's Microsoft once.
Maybe they're willing to take a hit on it so people will get that gaming system, and as you say, the Trojan horse in their living room.
I've not really heard you say that before, but I really like that, because it's true.
Yeah.
Another Xbox story sure to piss off people that bought their Xboxes launch week.
Yeah, well, this isn't really... They shouldn't be too pissed off about it.
The CPU is getting upgraded.
Basically, all they're doing is they're making the same CPU.
It's a bit smaller, so it's going to take less power, less heat.
That's about it.
Although, they're really having many issues with the CPU overheating.
That was never the problem.
It was the GPU overheating.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
I was just going to say, trust me, those Xbox 360s had problems.
If you don't believe me, go back and listen to the show when I bought my Xbox 360 that same week.
I was a little unhappy.
All you have to know is it's not going to make your Xbox 360 any faster.
So if you bought it launch day, whatever, and it's still working, not to worry.
And it's not really expected it's going to cause any compatibility issues.
But then again, I've seen them screw up smaller things.
Although hopeful models...
hopeful modders might find a way to overclock it with that more thermally efficient CPU.
You think they haven't done it yet?
They might.
I don't think so.
We shall see.
is powered by a pair of ARM processors, has an open source API and development tools, and can run thousands of classic console video games, online retailer Dynamism says.
I think that's it, Dynamism.
The GP2X was originally known as the GPX2.
It's got 64 megs of RAM, Flash, expandable via an SD card slot,
3.5 inch QVGA LCD monitor that supports 170,000 colors, 4-way controller and a small thumb joystick on the left, I.O.
ports include stereo headphone jack, USB 2.0, and TV out.
And of course, people are loading that crap up with emulators.
Kind of interesting.
Would anything like this ever make it big?
No, why not?
I mean, this sounds great!
It's a total geek thing, but hey, it plays thousands of games.
It plays thousands of games.
It's great.
But where's the challenge of putting Linux on that?
I mean, get this, $170 to $200 for this thing.
Is that not cheaper?
Isn't the PSP $199 still?
I can't remember.
$199 to $149?
Yeah, it's about that.
This thing is as much as a PSP.
And it's just made for developing.
GK128 says you can put a different Linux distro on.
That's the challenge.
He's got a point.
is basically sick of Duke Nukem Forever.
And he's, you know, from 3D Realms, basically saying, you know, it's taken so long to actually develop the game.
Just right now, you know, the problem is when they show it off, you know, people are going to be like, eh, whatever.
But they just want to finish it.
They want to get it done, get it out there, and try to recover some of that many, many dollars spent on developing it.
So they can work on the sequel that apparently they were talking about working on.
I can't believe they're talking about a sequel for Duke Nukem Forever.
I mean... It's called Duke Nukem.
No, really.
No, really, what they should do is change the name of Duke Nukem Forever.
Change it to something else.
Yeah, Duke Nukem Forever isn't coming out, but... It's, uh... Duke Nukem 3.
Luke Socketum Forever.
I mean, honestly, I think what they should do is they should develop the game and just release all the partial games that they had, like the one on the Quake 2 engine, the one on the Unreal engine...
Just scrap the name and call it Duke Nukem 4.
That's all you gotta do.
I don't know.
We'll see.
Do you want to be the first person in the world to play the Nintendo Revolution?
I bet you do, you little fanboys and girls.
Well, here's the deal.
Nintendo and AOL.com are teaming up, and they're going to be having a contest.
One lucky Nintendo fan gets to go to Los Angeles, touch and play with the Revolution before the conference, and then present the machine to the world a few hours later at the Nintendo Conference.
By the way, you're going to the Nintendo Conference, aren't you, Loki?
Maybe.
I hate you.
I hate you.
How did you get in?
I've got connections.
Oh, you little bitch.
I'm not going.
DarkSakura's not going, but Loki is going to Nintendo Conference and we'll let you know firsthand what happens.
But you're not going to be the second person in the world to play the thing either, right?
I'll beat people up.
Well, they're going to be having the black eyed peas there to distract people so I can play the console, so...
All right.
But I'm going to definitely get to play before E3.
Here's the funny thing.
Three finalists are going to be chosen by entries that are given on AOL's website, but only one person is going to be selected once they're all out there to actually do it.
Wouldn't that suck to be one of the other two?
But they all get to go to E3 anyway, huh?
Who cares?
They get to go.
So what?
I was the first to play in the world.
Whatever.
I mean, it's no big deal.
Yeah, get out of my way.
I want to play.
I was the first.
I guess I wasn't really the first non-Kanami employee to play Supernova in the United States, so that was kind of cool.
It's just like Final Fantasy XI this week.
I was the first person to get Corsair!
Well, I was the first person to get laid tonight.
Is there any quests involved with that?
Yeah, there's big quests and the whole thing.
So is everybody Puppet Master now?
Everybody just has to be first.
Everybody just wants to be first.
It's like, I'm looking for a white mage, but all we have is blue mage and Corsair and Puppet Master.
I wish I had time for that game.
I'm sorry, it's just the 360 thing just could have been better.
So anyway, if you want to enter AOL, I think you have to be on AOL to do it, so I hope you're there.
Anyway, but Rob, how will I ever find a CD to sign up for AOL?
I don't know, maybe go to AOL.com?
Oh, maybe.
Loki, do you have any other release dates for us?
I slotted some time to talk about release dates, but I don't know if you have your list or whatever.
What's coming up this week?
Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories moved dates.
It moved to June 6th, and they dropped the price again to $19.99 retail.
Oh, I'm being corrected by our chat room.
It's not AOL only.
It is open to non-AOL members as well.
GK128 said it first.
Thank you, guys.
I should go sign up for that and see if I can win it.
I know, maybe I should go sign up too.
I don't want to get AOL crap.
Well, then again, I already get it.
How much, how worse could it be?
Because I had AOL for two weeks because I bought it for a trip.
Just don't, I don't want to, I feel dirty.
You don't leave AOL.
I know, I know.
Ever.
No, but next week, or actually I should say this week, great stuff coming out, finally, finally,
Finally, Advent Children is finally coming out.
Is it finally here?
Finally.
They're advertising it on TV, so you can go pick it up.
You might even be able to find it in stores now if you're listening to the podcast because people like Breaking Street Date.
But definitely go check it out if you haven't seen it yet, although you probably have on the internet.
But now's your chance to get it.
Nice English copy of it.
Go check it out now.
Also, coming out this week, I have Outrun 2006 Coast to Coast, which is going to be pretty fun.
Also, Rampage Total Destruction coming out, which isn't really any different than the last few Rampage games.
And then, Windback 2, Project Poseidon is coming out.
not too much buzz on that but that's still good.
Ace Combat Zero, The Balkan War.
If you're a flight sim fan you're going to love that.
I believe that was all the big stuff.
I was really looking for Grand Theft Auto but they had to move it.
Hopefully they're either working on multiplayer or fixing multiplayer because their multiplayer sucked.
God damn lazy programmers.
It's no wonder that is what's going to take 2 down.
Delphi
Maybe not, CompuServe.
Minespring?
Maybe.
If you go all the way back to Commodore 64, there was one, it was before AOL, because AOL bought them out.
Quark, I want to say it was called?
Yeah, Quark.
I used to freaking go on a bulletin board, which had internet access.
BBSs were hardcore.
I used to do BBSs in Sacramento area, like hardcore locally.
Grab the California Computer News, a little free publication that was out there, have the BBS list in the back, and you can find a bunch of stuff on there.
Remember back in the day, those you guys used to call into BBS, it's probably if you're more like our age, like in your 20s, although I imagine there's some teens that remember this too.
It wasn't about the size of your internet penis, but it was about how much of the SysOps ass you kissed to get access points.
It was for more time with door games, so you could play Legend of the Red Dragon and The Pit and Trade Wars 2002 and all those games.
It was all about downloading registered shareware programs, 2400 BPS, or you know, 56K BPS, and also, and basically, you know, using that wonderful Z-Batch protocol to download everything in your, you know, telnet.
56K?
Are you kidding?
9600 baud?
I want an Orange Lounge Radio BBS.
That's what I want.
Can we have that?
Can we make that happen?
Can't you do it through Telnet now or something?
I'm going to talk to our webmaster.
Why would we want a BBS?
Because it's a BBS.
You can play Legend of the Red Dragon in the pit.
We have the technology.
Yes, we have the technology.
We can build it.
My mother would never let me get a second phone line to run a BBS when I was a kid.
I want one now.
Can't we just do something on the website that'll look like a BBS?
No, I want a BBS.
I want message boards and everything.
Let's just make a mod and call it a day.
Fuck a mud, I want to be BS.
I played muds for like two weeks, and then I was like, oh my god.
Two weeks?
Oh my god, you're like uber hardcore.
I know, I was like, after two weeks, I was like, this is the nerdiest I've ever been in my entire life.
And that's saying quite a bit.
That makes me feel nerdier than usual.
Alright.
Anyway, we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this little break.
Kid Whatever, one of the artists from In The Groove, is going to be with us in Part B, so definitely, definitely stay tuned.
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
