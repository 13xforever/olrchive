1
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:24,230
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, boys and girls, we're back here for the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth.

2
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,273
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that part of the show that's too hot to podcast, only available when you listen live here on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

3
00:00:31,954 --> 00:00:32,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

4
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,095
[SPEAKER_04]: What should we get into first?

5
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:35,876
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a little bit of how was your week, how was your day?

6
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:39,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat room, go ahead and send me your FUs.

7
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:40,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Send them over private message.

8
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:42,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I have neglected them for the past two weeks.

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It's high time we got to read some for you guys.

10
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:47,783
[SPEAKER_04]: So go ahead and private message me your FUs, and we'll read them tonight.

11
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:50,685
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, let's do a little bit of how was your week, how was your day.

12
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:51,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you want to start us off?

13
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:53,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, my week.

14
00:00:54,587 --> 00:01:00,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally got my bonus money to which I purchased my laptop.

15
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:03,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this Gateway, it's an MX7525.

16
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:12,811
[SPEAKER_01]: and mobile Athlon 64 bit 4000 plus.

17
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:18,513
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got, well, had one gig of RAM in it, now has a gig and a half because that's all that the motherboard will allow.

18
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:22,974
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 gig hard drive, which is all the motherboard will allow because I think it's a bit older.

19
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:33,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Windows Media Center Edition and an ATI Mobility X600 card with 128 megabytes of RAM dedicated and 128 that shares from the main RAM.

20
00:01:36,258 --> 00:01:37,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is awesome.

21
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:39,544
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty hot.

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,901
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, literally pretty hot.

23
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:43,663
[SPEAKER_01]: My lap is really warm.

24
00:01:43,763 --> 00:01:45,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to really get one of those cool mats for this.

25
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:48,347
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a pretty slick computer.

26
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:50,448
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some interesting stuff on it.

27
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:53,111
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I don't like about it, one, it's gateway.

28
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:56,093
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really dig the cow computers too much.

29
00:01:56,474 --> 00:02:00,817
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was an open box computer, so I got it for $300 less than it was.

30
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:03,239
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it wasn't bad.

31
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,343
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, it's going to be great for video editing.

32
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:09,405
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

33
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:35,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Spike, thank you for filling in tonight.

34
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:36,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.

35
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:37,266
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my pleasure.

36
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:37,926
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a good time.

37
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:43,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to take you away from festivities in the living room for a little while to do our crappy little show, but we appreciate your contributions.

38
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:49,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, cosplay at Fanime, per our conversation at IHOP earlier, is going to rock.

39
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the best idea ever.

40
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:54,052
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be a legendary cosplay, that's all I have to say.

41
00:02:54,372 --> 00:02:57,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It took everything in my power not to bring it up during the show.

42
00:02:57,634 --> 00:02:58,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

43
00:02:58,774 --> 00:03:01,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to wow you all with my elite cosplay skills.

44
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:02,976
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your week?

45
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:03,497
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

46
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:10,901
[SPEAKER_03]: My week was really great, except that I hate having to earn money to make my life happen.

47
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, that whole, like, earning money things.

48
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:16,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Jobs are so overrated.

49
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:18,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

50
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:25,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, but, uh, no, my day and my weekend, which I've, you know, spent in your apartment has been awesome.

51
00:03:28,152 --> 00:03:29,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you had a good time.

52
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:30,893
[SPEAKER_04]: My apartment's a fun time.

53
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:32,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as fun as my bedroom, though.

54
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:33,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

55
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:34,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Jokes!

56
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:34,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi!

57
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:36,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, snap.

58
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:38,694
[SPEAKER_04]: So, cosplay.

59
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:39,554
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

60
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:40,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be a duck.

61
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:41,914
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

62
00:03:41,974 --> 00:03:43,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, now you just jumped the shark.

63
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:44,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, nah, nah.

64
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:47,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else, Spike?

65
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,176
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not really.

66
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:55,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent my whole week with my free time playing Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy XI, which I was hoping was XII.

67
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:57,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't work out that way.

68
00:03:58,206 --> 00:03:58,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

69
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:01,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to come back to Final Fantasy XI this week.

70
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a week break because I needed to give Miklatov some time to catch up to us.

71
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:09,540
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really want to play Final Fantasy XI with us, you can always send me a private message on the forums.

72
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't send it to me in chat because I'll miss it tonight.

73
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:14,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Best way is to send me an email or private message and we'll get you.

74
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:17,570
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to play me on Xbox Live sometime, just know this.

75
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Because some more people have been adding me to Xbox Live lately.

76
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:27,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I do a podcast on video games with my friends does not necessarily mean I am very good at gaming.

77
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,750
[SPEAKER_04]: It means I love gaming.

78
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to play games.

79
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:31,531
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't mean I'm good at them.

80
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:33,571
[SPEAKER_04]: So chances are you will kick my ass.

81
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:36,352
[SPEAKER_04]: So please don't expect that I will actually be a challenge.

82
00:04:36,412 --> 00:04:39,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Chances are I will be like playing a 10-year-old.

83
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,393
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a one hell of a challenge at full auto.

84
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:44,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I sold the game back because I got all my achievement points.

85
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:44,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you.

86
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:49,224
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I were to borrow it again, I would be one hell of a match.

87
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:53,567
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just one of those games, you know, online wasn't that great.

88
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:57,050
[SPEAKER_01]: It was laggy and really glitchy at times.

89
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,773
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe Full Auto 2 when that comes out.

90
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:04,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that game fucking, oh, I love that game.

91
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Needs deathmatch.

92
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:12,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Needs a deathmatch like Twisted Metal because I think that's the only thing that was missing from that game is Twisted Metal style deathmatch.

93
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:14,422
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

94
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:17,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my week and my day.

95
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:21,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really have a whole lot to say outside of the gaming stuff.

96
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:25,834
[SPEAKER_04]: The casino was fun, I guess, this weekend, even though I lost money.

97
00:05:25,894 --> 00:05:27,855
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good to just kind of go with friends and hang out.

98
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:29,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Watched some movies Friday night.

99
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:32,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Watched Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which I hadn't seen yet.

100
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:34,879
[SPEAKER_04]: That movie was funny.

101
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,321
[SPEAKER_04]: You just made a wincing noise over there, Loki.

102
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:37,781
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't like it?

103
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:38,822
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

104
00:05:38,862 --> 00:05:39,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was funny.

105
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:40,623
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a fun movie.

106
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:41,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you watch E?

107
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:06,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

108
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,474
[SPEAKER_04]: The brother was pretty good looking.

109
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:33,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Her brother.

110
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:35,676
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, her ex, Billy Bob.

111
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:36,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, thanks.

112
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:37,117
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

113
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:38,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, forget it.

114
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,481
[SPEAKER_04]: This conversation is going... I also watched a really old movie.

115
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:44,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not really old.

116
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:45,141
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from a few years ago.

117
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:45,942
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an Academy Award.

118
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:48,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched In the Bedroom.

119
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:49,344
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good.

120
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:50,104
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sad.

121
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:51,005
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.

122
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:53,498
[SPEAKER_04]: This has nothing to do with gaming whatsoever.

123
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,562
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you get when you turn into the afterbirth is you get to hear our stupid stories from the week.

124
00:06:58,142 --> 00:07:01,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't it have been great if they made a game based on the movie?

125
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:03,006
[SPEAKER_04]: In the bedroom, the game?

126
00:07:04,187 --> 00:07:04,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

127
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:08,770
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.

128
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:10,412
[SPEAKER_03]: As stupid as the guy game?

129
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:13,694
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the second stupidest idea I've ever heard.

130
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:15,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever played Chuck Rock?

131
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:16,737
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

132
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:18,478
Rats.

133
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:19,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever played...

134
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:23,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think of the worst 8-bit games I've ever played.

135
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:26,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who.

136
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever played that game?

137
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:29,612
What a what?

138
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:31,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you make me remember that?

139
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:36,475
[SPEAKER_04]: You're so hardcore for remembering a Color Dreams game.

140
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:38,616
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me love you even more.

141
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:42,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Color Dreams, Loki?

142
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:44,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Color Dreams?

143
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:46,200
[SPEAKER_04]: You're so not cool.

144
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:48,042
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because you're a kid.

145
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:49,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a kid.

146
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:50,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just teasing you.

147
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you should see, oh my god, we're just lit up with FUs tonight.

148
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:21,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like, they're just, and I bet you half of these are gonna say, FU to Sky for cutting out the FUs for the past couple weeks.

149
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,317
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

150
00:08:23,257 --> 00:08:24,098
[SPEAKER_04]: We've just been busy.

151
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:25,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Deal with it.

152
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into tonight's FUs.

153
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:30,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I'm queuing up some music we can listen to for the FUs.

154
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,704
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll use some of our old theme songs here.

155

164
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:02,934

00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:25,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Such a short time for free.

174
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:26,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you ask me to pay $50.

175
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:28,917

176

180
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:13,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I could barely scrape together an outphase expert course, let alone a Taku or Taka themed one.

181
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:15,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and F you to the mode that's depicted in the attract mode.

00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:17,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami says, it's not actually in the game.

183
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:19,278

187
00:10:35,598 --> 00:10:39,619
[SPEAKER_04]: My TV turns black and white after a few minutes and it sucks to play games and watch TV on it.

188
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a new TV.

189
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:41,119

[SPEAKER_04]: I started off just getting headaches.

192
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,541
[SPEAKER_04]: It developed into a 103 degree freaking fever.

193
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:52,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I somehow screwed up my back and couldn't walk for four damn days which drove me insane because I can't hold still.

194
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:58,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortunately, I still had Advance Wars, although when you're about to pass out, you will probably not be on top of your game in Tactical Warfare.

195
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:02,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Advance Crack, F you to Uzyum because it's so incredibly lame.

[SPEAKER_04]: Xander C says, F you to Latin.

197
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:07,396
[SPEAKER_04]: It still isn't done.

198
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:08,877
[SPEAKER_04]: People still have to learn Latin?

199
00:11:09,558 --> 00:11:10,298
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me sad.

200
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:11,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn, Romans.

201
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,704
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Kingdom Hearts 2, says Xander C. Sure, it rocks, but now I suck even worse at Guitaruman.

[SPEAKER_04]: F you to not having any ecstasy.

204
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:22,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, ecstasy.

205
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Shame, shame.

206
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:25,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you mean the song in DDR.

207
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:26,894
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to not being a duck.

208
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:29,617
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to the big face that chases me down in the kitchen.

209
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:31,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I like you.

210
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:32,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Too much ecstasy.

211
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zaku says F you to not being able to use up all my meals for the week due to Easter vacation.

212
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:46,269
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to my school for not acting fast enough to get rid of a mouse that was terrorizing my apartment since we had to corner it and scoop him up in a box and release him outside.

213
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:50,232
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to my sneakers since they are on their last breaths leaking water into my feet.

214
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:59,811
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ PooEater would like to say F you to the guy who cut me off this morning, making me spill my chocolatey ice cream treat onto my lap.

215
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:00,792
[SPEAKER_04]: F you, guy.

216
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:01,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you to hell.

217
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:03,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss my chocolatey treat.

218
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:04,296
[SPEAKER_04]: My pants are wet.

219
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:05,237
[SPEAKER_04]: My lap is cold.

220
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:05,818
[SPEAKER_04]: F you, guy.

221
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:26,634
[SPEAKER_04]: GS191 says F you to myself for sucking at Beatmania F you to the postal service for losing my Gamefly mail F you to the MacBook Pro for not having a delete key I have to log into a domain and can't do a control alt delete to log in By the way, I'm not buying a MacBook Pro until they fix this And F you to work for making me work stupid long hours Fuck working in retail

00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:31,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Illusion says, F you to people that hate Bucky O'Hare for NES.

223
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:32,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

224
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:38,953
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, F you to my boss for trying to get me to work on Thursday, which is a Jewish holiday that I requested a month ago.

225
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:44,056
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to totally unrelated Skype calls killing everyone else's time that has something related to say.

226
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:49,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to Nintendo for not throwing people a curveball and not naming the revolution the dolphin.

227
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:58,064
[SPEAKER_04]: and lastly, Agent 47 says F you to EA because they're evil and F you to the guy that directed House of the Dead.

228
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,169
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, chat room.

229
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:03,050
[SPEAKER_04]: You got your F yous.

230
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:03,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't you happy?

231
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:05,565
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

232
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:26,196
[SPEAKER_04]: The chat room is always there.

233
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:33,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there's a few people like Dark Knight and Dark Tetsuya and Misty and some of them that check in during the day and will say hi to you if they see you there.

234
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,520
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out.

235
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:39,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there's also spinoff shows that we do here on this network.

236
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesday nights, pump up the volume.

237
00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:42,905
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura brings you her request show.

238
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:46,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine she will be back, assuming she's over her sickness.

239
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:47,888
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll be back this Tuesday at 7 o'clock.

240
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Rob Roberts show is on Wednesday at 7 o'clock.

241
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:50,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that's me.

242
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,530
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my show.

243
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:52,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And we, you know...

244
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,654
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

245
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget the wiki quote.

246
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt's wiki quote is currently being queued for deletion.

247
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:21,223
[SPEAKER_04]: If you wiki heads want to do anything about that, that would be great.

248
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:25,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody suggested merging it into an Orange Lounge Radio article, which I think is a great idea.

249
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:29,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then somebody could also quote the line from tonight, Resident Evil 4, bitch.

250
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:31,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Would be a great quote from tonight and other things.

251
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,949
[SPEAKER_04]: So save the wiki quote, those of you wiki heads that know how to do that.

252
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:37,570
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it gets deleted, we're not going to cry.

253
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:39,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the end of the world.

254
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:41,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt would probably rather see it go.

255
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:42,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming.

256
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:44,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

257
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:48,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have something you wanted to add, Loki, before we get into Cage Match?

258
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:59,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Reading, they have some more info about Red Steel, that game we were talking about in Part A. They're actually talking about some of the stuff that's done with the controller anyways.

259
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,491
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also from the Game Informer article.

260
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:06,813
[SPEAKER_01]: The development of the game started just right after E3 2005, which is interesting.

261
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:13,534
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

262
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,392
[SPEAKER_01]: The first, like, third game, they said you have to be extremely brutal in killing people.

263
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:35,853
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was kind of cool?

264
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:42,295
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have multiplayer online and split screen and a bunch of different unique multiplayer modes.

265
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:45,777
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.

266
00:15:45,817 --> 00:15:47,457
[SPEAKER_01]: It says it doesn't feel like a light game.

267
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:54,060
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says AI is intelligent, will cover while you're attacking and attack while you're reloading.

268
00:15:55,251 --> 00:16:22,229
[SPEAKER_01]: and it says the AI is based on benchmarks set by FEAR or the game FEAR looks pretty sweet alright oh and one thing I thought was interesting they're going to have some different like I guess interactive parts where you'll be talking to people and you can are given like yes no answers and you can nod your head using the rev mode for yes or no that's kind of neat

269
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:26,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else really quickly before we get into tonight's cage match?

270
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no.

271
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:32,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, then let's do the cage match, shall we?

272
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:39,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I just passed this song on Beatmania the other day, finally.

273
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:39,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Got my way back.

274
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,452
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm getting my skill back at Beatmania, finally.

275
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:46,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually passed a couple of others, even though they were the low-end 4s and 6s.

276
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:49,376
[SPEAKER_04]: But I passed some 7 stars, and I'm working on the 8s.

277
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:50,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I used to be able to pass Colors.

278
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:51,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Nemesis.

279
00:16:51,838 --> 00:16:52,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I passed Nemesis once.

280
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:54,640
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's probably the hardest song I've ever passed.

281
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,461
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm starting to get my Beatmania skills back.

282
00:16:57,201 --> 00:17:00,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And I ordered 9th Style, because there was a website having a sale.

283
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not going to give them a free plug, but they were selling it.

284
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:06,488
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to know, send me a private message, because they're selling it for only $40, which I thought was a good deal.

285
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:09,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into Cage Match tonight.

286
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one is a holdover.

287
00:17:11,411 --> 00:17:14,713
[SPEAKER_04]: It was DarkSakura's winner for the last two weeks in a row.

288
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:16,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it win again tonight?

289
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:17,654
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have the final say.

290
00:17:17,674 --> 00:17:19,696
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to be in our chat room to play along.

291
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:20,756
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

292
00:17:20,776 --> 00:17:21,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Click on chat.

293
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:22,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one tonight.

294
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:24,739
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only a clip because you heard it last week.

295
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,999
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Babyland.

296
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Some great indie rock here with Gary is the song.

297
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:29,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

298
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:15,630
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, song number one in tonight's cage match, Babyland with Gary.

299
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:17,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it win again tonight?

300
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,595
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to you after you hear these other two songs.

301
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number two comes to us from Loki.

302
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:22,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what did you pick tonight?

303
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:25,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mic's not on.

304
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:30,027
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked this song off of this album called Who Am I?

305
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:31,890
[SPEAKER_01]: It's by, I want to say...

306
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:35,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken O, X-Noise, Diffusion

307
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,571
Time, Space

308
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:22,337
DarkSakura, DarkSakura

309
00:24:06,584 --> 00:24:09,066
Thanks for watching!

310
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:34,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that was song number two in tonight's Cage Match X-Noise with Diffusion.

311
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:37,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and see what everybody in the room thought of that one.

312
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:37,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki!

313
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn your mic on, buddy.

314
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:41,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it.

315
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:46,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a longer version than I normally listen to, so that one was off of kind of a mix.

316
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:48,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, nine.

317
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Spike!

318
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:53,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was a pretty good song.

319
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:56,148
[SPEAKER_03]: And grade it on a scale of 1 to 10.

320
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, on a scale of 1 to 10, probably an 8.

321
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, super.

322
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Extifer, hi!

323
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:02,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

324
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:03,792
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you give that song?

325
00:27:04,132 --> 00:27:06,193
[SPEAKER_00]: I would give it a damn 8.

326
00:27:06,753 --> 00:27:06,813
[SPEAKER_00]: An 8.

327
00:27:07,714 --> 00:27:08,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Any reason why?

328
00:27:09,314 --> 00:27:10,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely no reason whatsoever.

329
00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:15,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Nelly, what would you give your fiancé's song there that he put in the cage, Matt?

330
00:27:16,978 --> 00:27:19,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't listening, but I'll give it a 10 because I love him.

331
00:27:21,577 --> 00:27:24,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, she's putting porn on my laptop, by the way.

332
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:24,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I noticed that.

333
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:31,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you such a... Nelly, why are you just... She really is putting porn on your laptop.

334
00:27:31,221 --> 00:27:36,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Nelly, why are you... Oh my, that's a... Why are you putting that on his laptop?

335
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:39,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Because look how disgusting, that'd be so funny.

336
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:44,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if he shows it to somebody and he doesn't know it's there, like, I shouldn't even show him that I'm putting it on there.

337
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:46,486
[SPEAKER_04]: They know it's there.

338
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:48,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you endorse your fiancé looking at porn?

339
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:49,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

340
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:51,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

341
00:27:53,035 --> 00:27:53,415
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

342
00:27:55,677 --> 00:27:56,017
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

343
00:27:56,297 --> 00:27:57,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to song number three.

344
00:27:57,978 --> 00:27:59,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number three is my pick tonight.

345
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:05,301
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the goth in me that's making me put in this song, or the EBM master.

346
00:28:05,342 --> 00:28:06,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to say.

347
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:07,623
[SPEAKER_04]: But I like this band.

348
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,424
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been around forever, but I've just started really liking them.

349
00:28:10,444 --> 00:28:11,785
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is their new single.

350
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:15,247
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Chrome, and the band is VNV Nation.

351
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:15,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

352
00:33:01,877 --> 00:33:06,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that was song number three in tonight's cage match, BNV Nation with Chrome.

353
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:10,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have a look and see what the folks in the studio thought of that one.

354
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:10,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki.

355
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:12,112
[SPEAKER_04]: That was okay.

356
00:33:12,732 --> 00:33:16,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven, I was a bit distracted by my fiancé trying to put four in my laptop.

357
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:16,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't we all?

358
00:33:17,018 --> 00:33:17,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Spike.

359
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to give that one probably a 9.

360
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:22,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big fan of VNV.

361
00:33:22,243 --> 00:33:26,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to spin them at clubs years back, following them for a long time.

362
00:33:26,165 --> 00:33:27,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like those guys.

363
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:29,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Spike, do you have any live shows coming up you want to plug?

364
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:31,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have given you another opportunity on the podcast.

365
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:37,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I have something coming up, but I don't want to talk about it until it's a good deal, but probably in late May I'll be doing a few clubs.

366
00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:40,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Come back to the show and give it a plug.

367
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:43,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw in something gaming related for us.

368
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:43,818
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all we ask.

369
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:47,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'd probably close the night with one of the Xanadu mixes from DDR.

370
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:48,523
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so badass.

371
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:51,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, well, the thing is, one of the shows would be at a gay club.

372
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:52,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there you go.

373
00:33:52,808 --> 00:33:53,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Xanadu, bam.

374
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:03,632
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I will associate Cunt with that song because I saw it on Loki's computer.

375
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,153
[SPEAKER_00]: So that deserves a pretty much a 9.

376
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:09,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear it.

377
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:12,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Nelly, what did you think of VNV Nation with Chrome?

378
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, wasn't listening, so I'll give it a 10.

379
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:17,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

380
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:17,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

381
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:21,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I give that song like a 9 because I like VMV Nation.

382
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:23,586
[SPEAKER_04]: That song makes me want to dance like I'm in Silent Hill.

383
00:34:25,627 --> 00:34:26,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the people do at the club.

384
00:34:26,808 --> 00:34:29,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you've ever been to the golf club, they dance like they're in Silent Hill.

385
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:33,051
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like... The sirens are going off.

386
00:34:34,632 --> 00:34:36,933
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, place vote now.

387
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's review the three songs you can vote for tonight.

388
00:34:39,095 --> 00:34:40,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one, Babyland, Gary.

389
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:41,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Babyland.

390
00:34:45,578 --> 00:34:49,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number two you can vote for tonight, X-Noise with Diffusion.

391
00:34:51,461 --> 00:34:52,082
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a bad clip.

392
00:34:52,122 --> 00:34:52,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try that again.

393
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:54,643
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Noise with Diffusion.

394
00:34:57,685 --> 00:34:59,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't find a good clip for this song.

395
00:34:59,086 --> 00:35:00,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

396
00:35:00,086 --> 00:35:00,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

397
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:00,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the beat.

398
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:03,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the beat.

399
00:35:03,748 --> 00:35:04,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

400
00:35:09,996 --> 00:35:15,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is VNV Nation with Chrome.

401
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:24,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Lace vote now.

402
00:35:25,015 --> 00:35:31,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.

403
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:38,250
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have about 60 seconds to do it because we're about ready to pull the plug on this show because if you can believe it, we've been on air for three and a half hours straight.

404
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,091
[SPEAKER_04]: We need air.

405
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,312
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to go outside.

406
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Extifer, you came into the studio.

407
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:43,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you wanted to ruin the show somehow.

408
00:35:43,996 --> 00:35:44,697
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to say?

409
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:47,265
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have anything.

410
00:35:47,285 --> 00:35:49,566
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought Harry Potter in Russian today.

411
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:50,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

412
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:51,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's pretty cool.

413
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:52,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you watch it yet?

414
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:54,247
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched some of it.

415
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, for those that don't know, you're learning Russian.

416
00:35:57,308 --> 00:35:57,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

417
00:35:57,828 --> 00:36:06,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, some folks figured this out because I posted a picture of the TV on our forums over at OrangeSoundsRadio.com because I was showing my Xbox 360 with a Mario Kart background.

418
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:06,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

419
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,451
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can actually see the little tag on the TV that says the word television in Russian.

420
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:11,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

421
00:36:12,531 --> 00:36:16,454
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's because you have scattered the apartment with index cards.

422
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,815
[SPEAKER_04]: They're only supposed to be there a week, if I remember right.

423
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:21,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take them off now.

424
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:22,778
[SPEAKER_00]: I know them now.

425
00:36:22,798 --> 00:36:23,338
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's fine.

426
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:26,600
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you say television in Russian?

427
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,801
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's learning.

428
00:36:30,785 --> 00:36:31,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I like lesbians.

429
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:05,804
[SPEAKER_00]: I told ya!

430
00:37:06,084 --> 00:37:06,785
[SPEAKER_00]: I told ya!

431
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, God, you really lucked out, didn't you?

432
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:17,250
[SPEAKER_00]: Nelly's the funniest person in the world, and the reason why is because earlier we watched the Silent Hill making of little thing.

433
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,570
[SPEAKER_00]: I already told this story during the show.

434
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:18,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.

435
00:37:18,951 --> 00:37:19,371
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

436
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:20,351
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it again.

437
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,032
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell your way if you want.

438
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:23,273
[SPEAKER_00]: No, she's just funny.

439
00:37:23,293 --> 00:37:26,114
[SPEAKER_00]: She's just like, pussy scared of paper.

440
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:28,355
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny.

441
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,717
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are so easily amused.

442
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:33,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Not funny.

443
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:34,550
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.

444
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:37,872
[SPEAKER_04]: People should go to Nelly's MySpace, too.

445
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:40,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Nelly has the best MySpace I've ever seen.

446
00:37:40,914 --> 00:37:42,856
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even have Orange Launch Radio friended, though, do you?

447
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:44,697
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I will today.

448
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then how can they find Nelly on Myspace?

449
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:49,002
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your username?

450
00:37:49,022 --> 00:37:49,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

451
00:37:50,022 --> 00:37:50,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Nelly.

452
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:51,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just Nelly?

453
00:37:51,642 --> 00:37:52,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

454
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:54,103
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not going to bring up the rapper?

455
00:37:54,203 --> 00:37:55,343
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it will bring up the rapper.

456
00:37:55,383 --> 00:37:59,904
[SPEAKER_01]: What you got to do, it's kind of like the six degrees of Orange Lounge or something.

457
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to Orange Lounge, go to Rob's page.

458
00:38:04,425 --> 00:38:06,065
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because she's not in my top eight right now.

459
00:38:06,105 --> 00:38:06,845
[SPEAKER_01]: She's in my top eight.

460
00:38:06,865 --> 00:38:08,026
[SPEAKER_04]: She's in Extover's top eight, though.

461
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:10,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so go to Orange Lounge and Extover's in the top eight and then Nelly.

462
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:12,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And your picture isn't really of you, though.

463
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:14,427
[SPEAKER_04]: It's of you throwing babies, right?

464
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:14,487
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

465
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:15,743
[SPEAKER_02]: See, you gave it away!

466
00:38:15,783 --> 00:38:19,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, it's a picture of my favorite sport, which is baby throwing.

467
00:38:19,885 --> 00:38:23,946
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hilarious, and nobody at my work thought it was funny because of bastards.

468
00:38:24,726 --> 00:38:28,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, Nellie has the best MySpace page I've ever seen, and you'll know why when you go there.

469
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:35,510
[SPEAKER_04]: So go to the Orange Launch Radio MySpace, then hop over to Xtapers, and then make sure your sound's up, and hop over to Nellie's.

470
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:38,831
[SPEAKER_04]: And I helped.

471
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:45,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to count up cage match votes now, so somebody's got to fill time.

472
00:38:47,647 --> 00:38:49,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, help us fill time here.

473
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:52,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, think of a story that we haven't talked about yet tonight.

474
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:55,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see here.

475
00:38:55,769 --> 00:39:09,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, there's another grant that's out of Liberty City Stories, PSP cheat device update, and they added now where you can just the water levels, so you can flood cities and stuff and drive around the boat, which is kind of fun.

476
00:39:10,493 --> 00:39:16,536
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I'm surprised they should really put out tools like that because it is, you know, it adds more replayability to the game.

477
00:39:17,377 --> 00:39:28,002
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that they take, you know, a lesson from, you know, the users' requests on, like, you know, more customization for the multiplayer games and stuff like that because it really needs it.

478
00:39:29,881 --> 00:39:36,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I was going to say I hope I get my Game Informer soon because everyone gets theirs before me.

479
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:39,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't got my new issue of Xbox Magazine.

480
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:40,786
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already in newsstands.

481
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:45,288
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is the point of subscribing to a magazine then if I'm getting it late?

482
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:47,208
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the demos on the new Xbox Magazine?

483
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:48,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it worth me buying?

484
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:51,990
[SPEAKER_01]: The new Xbox Magazine is going to have a 360 demo on there.

485
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:52,871
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something good.

486
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:56,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say the 360 version of...

487
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:01,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitman, Blood Money.

488
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:02,483
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say it's on there.

489
00:40:02,863 --> 00:40:05,584
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't be positive, but I thought that's what it was.

490
00:40:06,324 --> 00:40:08,305
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know it has Hitman on there as a demo.

491
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:10,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if it's current gen or next gen.

492
00:40:10,245 --> 00:40:13,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, what else was on there?

493
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:15,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Just some really good demos.

494
00:40:15,407 --> 00:40:18,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say Hitman was on there.

495
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:19,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember, though.

496
00:40:19,848 --> 00:40:21,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at it for like half a second.

497
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:23,930
[SPEAKER_01]: But Game Informer is always good.

498
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,370
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always near the one.

499
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,291
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really weird because their website...

500
00:40:28,951 --> 00:40:31,553
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the news is really sketchy.

501
00:40:31,673 --> 00:40:34,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it's accurate, most of it's not.

502
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:37,417
[SPEAKER_01]: But in their magazine, it's pretty accurate.

503
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:40,779
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be like they have a lot of exclusives and stuff.

504
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:44,302
[SPEAKER_01]: There's such a separation between the website and the actual magazine.

505
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:49,065
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready to hear who won tonight's cage match?

506
00:40:49,705 --> 00:40:49,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

507
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:58,929
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a landslide vote tonight, and although all three songs got a pretty fair amount of votes, we had a lot of participation tonight.

508
00:40:58,969 --> 00:40:59,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, chat room.

509
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for exercising your democratic right to vote.

510
00:41:03,631 --> 00:41:04,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

511
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:06,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I will shove this microphone up your pee hole.

512
00:41:07,873 --> 00:41:13,375
[SPEAKER_04]: The song, the winning song tonight is X-Noise with Diffusion.

513
00:41:16,493 --> 00:41:16,773
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

514
00:41:16,873 --> 00:41:20,435
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was either this or a song that was by Rammstein.

515
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:21,876
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounded like it should be in Silent Hill.

516
00:41:23,877 --> 00:41:27,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And SSJ100Matt would like to remind you, P. Diddy says vote or die.

517
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:28,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Vote or die.

518
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:31,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I don't think P. Diddy voted in some of the earlier elections.

519
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,201
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey.

520
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:33,401
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Diddy now.

521
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:34,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

522
00:41:34,602 --> 00:41:35,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Diddy what?

523
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:36,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Diddy what?

524
00:41:36,303 --> 00:41:36,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, wait.

525
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:37,823
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Diddy?

526
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:38,804
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost the P?

527
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,540
[SPEAKER_01]: A fucking artist.

528
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone knocked the P out of him.

529
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:43,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick with a name.

530
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:44,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.

531
00:41:44,821 --> 00:41:46,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pick a name and stick with it.

532
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:54,663
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, you know, they're not like, you know, different clothes or whatever, or Pokemon cards or something like that.

533
00:41:54,703 --> 00:42:03,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Extover, your audio is so jacked up tonight because I had to turn it up for Spike, and now that you've got it, you're like... Yeah, that's exactly what you sound like.

534
00:42:03,444 --> 00:42:03,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Cranbor.

535
00:42:03,885 --> 00:42:05,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Just take the mic away a little bit.

536
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:08,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody needs me!

537
00:42:08,169 --> 00:42:09,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody needs me!

538
00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:10,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Hobobot or whatever.

539
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Winobot.

540
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I learn new things about porn every day.

541
00:42:33,206 --> 00:42:34,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Cunts really do look like flowers.

542
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:39,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here it is kids, your fortune cookie message of the day.

543
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:09,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki

544
00:43:36,474 --> 00:43:38,115
Thank you for watching!

545
00:44:02,648 --> 00:44:03,809
Thank you for watching!

546
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:48,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And there it is, the Kotimu version of V. Always a good time.

547
00:44:48,823 --> 00:44:49,544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it, guys.

548
00:44:49,584 --> 00:44:53,967
[SPEAKER_04]: We're now going to cut off the stream and take you back to Bomani and video game music and much more.

549
00:44:54,268 --> 00:44:58,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys, of course, as always, for supporting Independent Radio and Orange Lounge Radio.

550
00:44:58,231 --> 00:44:59,171
[SPEAKER_04]: We love you guys so much.

551
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:01,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, get better soon if you're listening, and take care.

552
00:45:01,973 --> 00:45:02,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great week.
