00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,520
Alright boys and girls, we're back here for the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth, it's that

2
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,520
part of the show that's too hot to podcast, only available when you listen live here on

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,640
OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Let's see, what should we get into first? How about a little bit

4
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,200
of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day? Chat room, go ahead and send me your FUs. Send

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,960
them over a private message. I have neglected them for the past two weeks. It's high time

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,280
we got to read some for you guys. So go ahead and private message me your FUs and we'll

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,280
read them tonight. In the meantime, let's do a little bit of How Was Your Week, How

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,760
Was Your Day. Loki, you want to start us off?

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:01,520
my week. I finally got my bonus money to which I purchased my laptop. I got this

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:14,200
gateway. It's an MX 7525. An Athlon, a mobile Athlon 64 bit 4000 plus. It's got, well

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,640
had 1 gig of RAM in it, now has a gig and a half because that's all that the

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,440
motherboard will allow. 100 gig hard drive, which is all the motherboard will

13
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:31,120
allow, because I think it's a bit older. Windows Media Center Edition and an ATI Mobility X600

14
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,380
card with 128 megabytes of RAM dedicated and 128 that it shares from the main RAM, which

15
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:44,000
is awesome. And it's pretty hot. I mean, literally pretty hot. My lap is really warm. I need

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,480
to really get one of those cool mats for this, but it's a pretty slick computer. It's got

17
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,660
interesting stuff on it. The only thing I don't like about it, one it's Gateway. I

18
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,100
don't really dig the cow computers too much, but this was an open box computer

19
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:06,400
so I got it for $300 less than it was, and so it wasn't bad. And also it's gonna be great

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:15,140
for video editing. That's all I can say about that. And what else? Yeah, bought an

21
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,500
G2 card for it. It's pretty slick and good for podcasts. It's just gonna be pretty nice

22
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,580
to have something on the go. I did get an orange backpack that goes with it, you know,

23
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:34,420
because I want to be cheesy like nerd. And yeah, it's gonna be awesome. All right. Spike,

24
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,860
thank you for filling in tonight. Appreciate it. It was my pleasure. It's always a good time.

25
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,140
Sorry to take you away from festivities in the living room for a little while, you know,

26
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,780
to do our crappy little show, but we appreciate your contributions.

27
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,300
And by the way, cosplay at Fanime, per our conversation at IHOP earlier, is

28
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,180
gonna rock.

29
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,260
I have the best idea ever. This will be a legendary cosplay, that's all I have to say.

30
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,620
It took everything in my power not to bring it up during the show.

31
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,460
I appreciate that. I'm gonna wow you all with my elite cosplay skills.

32
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,900
How was your week? How was your day?

33
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,940
My week was really great, except that I hate,

34
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,780
you know having to earn money to make my life happen

35
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,060
i know that all like earning money things i do

36
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,340
jobs are so overrated

37
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,160
seriously

38
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
on them but uh...

39
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,180
no much my day and my weekend

40
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,860
which i've you know spent in your apartment has been awesome

41
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,540
i'm glad you had a good time

42
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,060
my part is a fun time

43
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,300
not as fun as my bedroom though

44
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,140
just kidding

45
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,220
jokes i

46
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,860
old snap so

47
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,020
cosplay

48
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:46,540
i want to be a duck don't you know what that now you just jump the shark nana

49
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,020
anything else bike

50
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,200
no i'm not really i spent my whole week with my free time playing kingdom hearts

51
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,060
and uh...

52
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,140
final fantasy eleven which i was hoping was twelve

53
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,060
and it didn't work out that way

54
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,100
mom sorry

55
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,180
i'm i'm gonna come back to promise eleven this week i took a week break

56
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,700
because they need to get me put off some time to catch up to us

57
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,500
If you really want to play Final Fantasy XI with us, you can always send me a private message

58
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,560
on the forums. Don't send it to me in chat, because I'll miss it tonight.

59
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,460
Best way is to send me an email or private message and we'll get you.

60
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,940
If you want to play me on Xbox Live sometime, just know this,

61
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,620
because some more people have been adding me to Xbox Live lately,

62
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,500
just because I do a podcast on video games with my friends does not necessarily

63
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,860
mean I am very good at gaming.

64
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,740
It means I love gaming. I like to play games. That doesn't mean I'm good at them.

65
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,900
So chances are you will kick my ass.

66
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,300
so please don't expect that i will actually be a challenge chances are

67
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,260
i will be like you know playing a ten-year-old i was a one hell of a

68
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,620
challenge at full auto unfortunately i sold the game back because i got all my

69
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,540
achievement points damn you

70
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,580
but if i were to borrow it again i would be one hell of a match

71
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,180
it was just one of those games you know

72
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,780
online wasn't that great

73
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,660
it was laggy and

74
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,460
really glitchy at times so

75
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,940
full auto 2

76
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,900
when that comes out second uh... i'd love that game

77
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,900
needs

78
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,980
death match

79
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,340
needs a death match like twisted metal because i think that's the only thing is

80
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,340
missing from a game is twist mill style death match

81
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,220
uh... let's sell my week in my day uh... i don't really have a whole lot to say

82
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,220
outside of the gaming stuff uh... you know just uh... i have with the casino

83
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,740
was fun i guess this weekend even though i lost money it was good to just kind of

84
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,100
go with friends and hang out

85
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,880
watch some movies friday night uh... watch

86
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,000
mister mrs smith which i hadn't seen yet

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,280
that was funny i like it would you just made a wincing noise over there low-key

88
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,660
in like it was okay it was funny it was a fun movie why do people hate on

89
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,840
angelina jolie so but she's really funny like i really like to remember the

90
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,980
i don't know why it's considered like selling out to be an angelina jolie

91
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,540
fan she's really funny

92
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,060
so what if she's like you know adopts cambodians or whatever i think that's

93
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,800
She's into helping the world and all that stuff.

94
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,160
You say it like it's a bad thing, like we should throw rocks at her for it.

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,760
People make fun of her for it all the time.

96
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Do you watch E?

97
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,780
I know you watch the same shows I do on E television, they totally rag on her all the

98
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,780
time.

99
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,780
There's nothing...

100
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,240
That's for being crazy and having her ex-husband's blood in a vial around her neck, it has nothing

101
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
to do with the children.

102
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Okay well that's a little weird.

103
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,900
Okay you know what though, that just makes her kind of like Frankie in a, I don't know.

104
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,840
I had the making out with her brother thing, but come on, the blood?

105
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,180
He wasn't even hot.

106
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,320
I know.

107
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,740
Like that would have made it okay. The brother was pretty good looking, her brother.

108
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,980
But yeah, her ex, Billy Bob, yeah, no, thanks, no, bleh.

109
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,060
Alright, forget it.

110
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,860
This conversation is going, eepshh.

111
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,140
I also watched a really old movie, well not really old, it's from like a few years ago,

112
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,980
it was Academy Award, I watched In the Bedroom.

113
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,900
It was, you know,

114
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,640
it was good, it was sad,

115
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,940
a little bit.

116
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,660
this has nothing to do with gaming whatsoever that's what you get when you turn into the

117
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,260
afterbirth is you get to hear our

118
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,140
our stupid stories from the week. Wouldn't it have been great if they

119
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,980
made a game based on the movie?

120
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,140
What, in the bedroom the game?

121
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,300
Yes.

122
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,640
No, that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard. As stupid as the guy game?

123
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,520
That's the second stupidest idea I've ever heard.

124
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,120
Have you ever played Chuck Rock? No.

125
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,280
rats have you ever played uh...

126
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,280
i'm trying to get like the worst eight big games i've ever played

127
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,040

you so not cool

134
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
It's because you're a kid.

135
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
I'm not a kid. I'm just teasing you.

136
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Someone in the chatroom just badmouthed

137
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
the Bucky O'Hare game for NES.

138
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,160
I think that was a Konami game. That game was awesome.

139
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
I don't think I played it, I gotta be honest.

140
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
It played like a licensed Mega Man game.

141
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
Really.

142
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Wow, that's cool.

143
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Alright, let's go to the chatroom and read

232
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,660
right now we love it we love this attention that you guys show us our chat

233
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,940
room is open 24-7 during the week although we know you guys you know have

234
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,720
other things you want to do than lurk in our chat room all the time necessarily

235
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,900
but the chat rooms always there and I know like there's a few people like dark

236
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,800
night and dark Tetsuya and misty and some of them that check in during the

237
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,960
day and we'll say hi to you if they see you there so check that out also there's

238
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,100
There's also spin-off shows that we do here on this network.

239
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,900
Tuesday nights, pump up the volume, Dark Sakura brings you her quest show.

240
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,420
I imagine she will be back, assuming she's over her sickness.

241
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,900
She'll be back this Tuesday at 7 o'clock, and the Rob Roberts show is on Wednesday at

242
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,900
7 o'clock.

243
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:56,980
Hey, that's me, that's my show, and we play music and talk about tech geek stuff and whatever

244
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,060
sounds like fun.

245
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,860
And if you're Xander, you hate all the music that I play, so, you know, because I have

246
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,540
bad taste in music apparently. Well I do, didn't you get the memo that was going around

247
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:15,900
the office? Alright, oh, don't forget the wiki quote. Matt's wiki quote is currently

248
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,780
being queued for deletion. If you wikiheads want to do anything about that, that would

249
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,660
be great. Somebody suggested merging it into an Orange Launch radio article, which I think

250
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,740
is a great idea, because then somebody could also quote the line from Tonight Resident

251
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,060
Evil 4 bitch would be a great quote from tonight and other things so save the

252
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,460
wiki quote those you wiki heads that know how to do that but if it gets

253
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,900
deleted we're not gonna cry it's not the end of the world that Matt would

254
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:47,300
probably rather see it go I'm assuming maybe are you just want to add lucky

255
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,500
before we get in the cage match reading they have some more info about red steel

256
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,540
we're talking about in the first part a they're actually talking about like some

257
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,740
of the stuff that's done with the controller anyways. This is also from the Game Informer

258
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:11,660
article. The development of the game started just right after E3 2005, which is interesting.

259
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,160
Basically it's going to be a martial arts setting. The camera will be controlled by

260
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,460
the rev mode. The analog stick and the two buttons are going to be for moving and jumping

261
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:29,340
up and down, or jumping and ducking, I should say. You can actually... the first, like,

262
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:35,360
third game, they said you have to be extremely brutal in killing people. What else was kind

263
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,960
of cool? They're going to have multiplayer online in split screen, and a bunch of different

264
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:47,960
unique multiplayer modes, and... I don't know, it says it doesn't feel like a light game.

265
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,960
And it says, AI is intelligent, will cover while you're attacking, and attack while you're reloading.

266
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,960
And it says, the AI is based on benchmarks set by fear, or the game Fear.

267
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,960
So, looks pretty sweet.

268
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,960
Alright.

269
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,960
Oh, and one thing I thought was interesting.

270
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:12,960
They're going to have some different like, I guess, interactive parts where you'll be talking to people.

271
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,880
and you can are given like yes no answers and you can nod your head using

272
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:25,720
the rev mode for yes or no kind of anything else really quickly before we

273
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,640
get into tonight's cage match no all right then let's do the cage match

274
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:39,660
shall we I just passed the song on beat mania the other day finally got my way

275
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,980
way back I you know I'm getting my skill back at beatmania finally I can I

276
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,780
actually passed a couple of others even though they were the low-end fours and

277
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,860
sixes but I passed some seven stars I'm working on the eights because I used to

278
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,300
be able to pass colors that was a nemesis I passed nemesis once that's

279
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,020
probably the hardest song I've ever passed so I'm starting to get my beatmania

280
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,780
skills back and I ordered night style because there was a website having a

281
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,900
sale and I'm not gonna give them a free plug but they were selling it if you

282
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,620
want to know send me a private message because they're selling it for only $40

283
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,620
which I thought was a good deal so alright let's get into cage match night

284
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,820
song number one is a holdover it was dark Sakura's winner for the last two

285
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,940
weeks in a row will it win again tonight you guys have the final say you got to

286
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,900
be in our chat room to play along orange launch radio.com click on chat song

287
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,900

288
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:31,800
Babyland, some great indie rock here with Gary is the song. Enjoy!

289
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:10,260
We grow from experience We go on because we know there's nothing worth

290
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:16,260
And quitting to bow down to the negatives

291
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,260
We hold strong

292
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,260
Because we know there's something worth awaiting

293
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,260
This is the part of me that I understand

294
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:34,260
No, I can't control the wonder that I'm surprised

295
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,260
It's building, it's building

296
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:46,260
Don't tell me I'm wrong I'm living hard to be part of something new

297
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,260
The straight lines and the stereotypes are gone

298
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:59,260
As nature continues to crawl Curved lines in the big city skies

299
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,260
Bright lights and open your eyes to your eyes

300
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:14,260
We live for the experience

301
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:22,260
We go on because we know there's something to this wanting

302
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,260
Drown it in your eyes

303
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,260
Drown it in your eyes

304
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,260
Let's go!

305
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,260
I've got the super power

306
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,260
I do what I can, but that ain't gonna fly

307
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,260
Cause I know what I am and I apologize

308
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,260
I can't remember the artist who puts the compilation together.

309
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:47,260
But anyways, it's this song brought to you by this group called XNoise, and it's called

310
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,260
Diffusion.

311
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,260
It kind of reminds me of a Beatmania song.

312
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Alright, here it is, XNoise with Diffusion, song number two.

313
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,260
Enjoy

314
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,260
Space, energy, an illusion

315
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,260
Oh

316
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,260
Oh

317
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,260
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

318
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,260
Oh

319
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,260
Oh

320
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:34,860
Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, X-Noise with Diffusion.

321
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,740
Let's go around and see what everybody in the room thought of that one.

322
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,740
Loki!

323
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,980
Turn your mic on, buddy.

324
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,980
I liked it.

325
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:47,380
I have a longer version than I normally listen to, so that one's off of a mix.

326
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,380
Nine.

327
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,380
Spike!

328
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:55,020
I thought it was a pretty good song.

329
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,180
And graded on a scale of 1-10?

330
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,460
Oh, on a scale of 1-10, probably an 8.

331
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,460
Alright, super.

332
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,460
Uh, Xtafur, hi!

333
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,460
Hello!

334
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,080
What would you give that song?

335
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,780
I would give it a damn 8.

336
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,780
An 8.

337
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,180
Any reason why?

338
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,380
Absolutely no reason whatsoever.

339
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:16,900
Nelly, what would you give your fiancé's song there that he put in the cage mat?

340
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,700
I wasn't listening, but I'll give it a 10 because I love him.

341
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,700
Awwwwww.

342
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,580
She's putting porn on my laptop, by the way.

343
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,580
Why are you such a...

344
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,580
Nellie, why are you just...

345
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,580
She really is putting porn on your laptop.

346
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,580
Nellie!

347
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,580
Why are you...

348
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,580
That's...

349
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,580
Oh my...

350
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,580
That's a f***ing matter.

351
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,580
Why are you...

352
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,580
Why are you putting that on his laptop?

353
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,580
Because look how disgusting.

354
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,580
That'd be so funny.

355
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,580
Like, if he shows it to somebody and he doesn't know it's there, like, I shouldn't even show

356
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,580
him that I'm putting it on there.

357
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,580
I know it's there.

358
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,120
Do you endorse your fiance looking at porn?

359
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Absolutely.

360
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Okay.

361
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Can't be a hypocrite.

362
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
Alright.

363
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,080
Alright, let's go to song number three.

364
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,480
Song number three is my pick tonight.

365
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,520
It's the goth in me that's making me put in this song, or the EBM master, I don't know

366
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,720
what to say, but I like this band, they've been around forever, but I've just started

367
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
really liking them.

368
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,400
And this is their new single.

369
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:19,400
It's called Chrome and the band is VNV Nation, enjoy.

370
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:52,400
A million faces each, a million lies For each and all, a crown disguise

371
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Prompts for action, false reaction Embodied promise to a machine so pure

372
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Have the measure of blind ambition The testament to your singular disease

373
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Get so wisdom you heed no warning Your desires giving you away

374
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:29,400
If I could change your mind I wouldn't save you from the path you wander

375
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:35,400
In desperation dreams And this soul can set you free

376
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,400
And I still hear you scream

377
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,400
And everyone, you'll never see no motion

378
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Fighting innocence, a fire to set you free

379
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Your actions turn conquest to dust

380
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Importance to fate

381
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,400
You foolishly place trust

382
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Sense fear in your broken breathing

383
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Resolve to shadows till your body splires

384
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,400
All creation has a promise of heaven

385
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Until you travel the road to hell

386
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,400
I'm saying nothing for the good of myself

387
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,400
But I'm still talking and you're not listening

388
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,400
If I could change your mind

389
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,400
I wouldn't save you from the path you wander

390
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
In desperation dreams

391
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,400
And this soul can set you free

392
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,400
And I still hear you scream

393
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
In every breath

394
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,400
In every single motion

395
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
But in innocence

396
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,400
A fire to set you free

397
00:31:45,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Snythe descends upon the city The streets are cold, the lights go by

398
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:17,400
In the stories of the people A million faces, a million lives

399
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:32,400
They'll never say they feel what you feel But they can see the world you see

400
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:47,400
And in their faces there are explosions A million faces, a million lies

401
00:32:47,400 --> 00:33:06,760
Okay, that was song number three in tonight's gauge match, BnV Nation with Chrome.

402
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,080
Let's have a look and see what the folks in the studio thought of that one, Loki.

403
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,080
That was okay.

404
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,080
This is seven.

405
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,640
I was a bit distracted by my fiance trying to put porn in my laptop.

406
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,640
we all spike I'd have to give that one it and probably a nine I'm a big fan of

407
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,120
V&V I used to spin them at clubs years back following them for a long time I

408
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,120
really like those guys spike do you have any live shows coming up coming up you

409
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,600
want to plug I should have given you another opportunity on the podcast um I

410
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,040
have something coming up but I don't want to talk about it until it's a good

411
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,520
deal but probably in late may I'll be doing a few clubs come back to the show

412
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,480
and give give it a plug and throw in something gaming related for us that's

413
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Well, I'd probably close the night with one of the Xanadu mixes from DDR.

414
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
You're so badass.

415
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Because, well, the thing is, one of the shows would be at a gay club.

416
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Okay.

417
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
So, Xanadu, bam.

418
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
All right.

419
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,480
Extover.

420
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
V&V Nation, Chrome.

421
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:04,480
I think, um, I will associate Kant with that song, because I saw it on Loki's computer.

422
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,480
So, that deserves a pretty much a 9.

423
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,480
I'm glad to hear it.

424
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Uh, Nelly!

425
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
What did you think of V&V Nation with Chrome?

426
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Again, wasn't listening, so I'll give it a 10.

427
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Yay!

428
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,480
Yay!

429
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,480
I give that song like a 9, because I like VMV Nation, and that song makes me wanna dance

430
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,680
like I'm in Silent Hill.

431
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
Like the people do at the club.

432
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,240
Like, have you ever been to the Goth Club?

433
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,800
They dance like they're in Silent Hill, they're like, oooh, and the sirens are going off.

434
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,160
Alright, place vote now!

443
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,720
ready to pull the plug on this show because if you can believe it we've been

444
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,840
on air for three and a half hours straight and we need air we need to go

445
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,300
outside extra fur you came into the studio I'm sure you want to ruin the

446
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,340
show somehow what do you want to say I didn't have anything I bought Harry

447
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,980
Potter and Russian today why because it's pretty cool did you watch it yet I

448
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,340
watched some of it now for those for those who don't know you're you're

449
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,180
learning Russian mm-hmm now some folks figured this out because I posted a

450
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:05,380
picture of the TV on our forums, over at ornithonshire.com, because I was showing my Xbox 360 with a

451
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:10,140
Mario Kart background, and you can actually see the little tag on the TV that says the

452
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:16,420
word television in Russian. And that's because you have scattered the apartment with index

453
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,420
cards. They're only supposed to be there a week, if I remember right, but they're all

454
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:25,500
still there now. I can take them off now, I know them now. No, it's fine, but how do

455
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:31,800
you say television in Russian? Televizor. Oh, so he's learning! That's great. So tell

456
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,900
us about, now what was your adventures today? My adventures today in Russian? I went to

457
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:42,180
a Russian video store and it was like I was in another country and Nellie was with me

458
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:48,540
and she's putting porn still on Loki's computer. I was going to give her gay porn websites,

459
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:54,860
she didn't want to do it. Aww, do gay porn! I think I got the impression that Nellie thought

460
00:36:54,860 --> 00:37:06,420
the gay porn was porn was boring didn't you think that I like lesbians I told

461
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,340
you boy God no you really lucked out in you no he's the funniest person in the

462
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,620
world and the reason why is because earlier we watched the science the

463
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:19,820
Silent Hill making of little I already told the story during oh man sorry you

464
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,820
You can do it again. You can tell your way if you want.

465
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,820
Oh no, she's just funny. She's just like,

466
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,820
the pussy's scared of paper.

467
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,820
That's so funny.

468
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,820
You guys are so easily amused.

469
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,820
It's not funny.

470
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,820
It's funny. People should go to Nellie's

471
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,820
MySpace too. Oh yeah.

472
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,820
Nellie has the best MySpace

473
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,820
I've ever seen. You don't even have Orange Lawn's

474
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,820
Radio Friended though, do you? No, but

475
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,820
I will today. Okay, well

476
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,820
then how can they find Nellie on MySpace?

477
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:52,540
know. What's your username? I don't know. Nellie. Is it just Nellie? Yes. So it's not

478
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,420
like the rap. It's not going to bring up the rapper? No, it will bring up the rapper. What

479
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:00,300
you got to do just it's kind of kind of like the six degrees of orange lounge or something.

480
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,980
Go to orange lounge. Go to Rob's page or actually no because she's not in my top eight right now.

481
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,180
She's in my top eight. She's in extraverse top eight though. Okay. So go to orange lounge and

482
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,860
extraverse in the top eight and then Nellie. And your picture isn't really of you though.

483
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,940
It's of you throwing babies, right? See, you gave it away. I was going to say. I'm sorry.

484
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:23,940
It's a picture of my favorite sport, which is baby throwing. It's hilarious and nobody at my work thought it was funny because of bastards.

485
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,940
Seriously, Nellie has the best MySpace page I've ever seen and you'll know why when you go there.

486
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,940
She does.

487
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,940
So go to the Orange Lodge Radio MySpace, then hop over to Exeter first.

488
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,940
Make sure your sound's up.

489
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,940
And then make sure your sound's up and hop over to Nellie's.

490
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,940
Yeah. That's how they do it.

491
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,940
And I helped.

492
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,940
I need to count up cage match votes now, so somebody's gotta fill time.

493
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,940
Matt, help us fill time here.

494
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,940
Loki, think of a story that we haven't talked about yet tonight.

495
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,940
Well, let's see here.

496
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,940
Oh, I was going to say, there's another Grand Theft Auto Liberty City story.

497
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,940
It's a PSP cheat device update.

498
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,940
And they added now where you can adjust the water levels.

499
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,940
So you can like flood cities and stuff and drive around the boat.

500
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,940
Which is kind of fun.

501
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,940
You know, and I'm surprised they should really put out tools like that.

502
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:18,080
that because it is you know it adds more replayability to the game and I hope

503
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,140
that they take you know a lesson from you know the users requests on like you

504
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,180
know custom more customization for the multiplayer games and stuff like that

505
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:32,940
because it really needs it other than that I was gonna say I hope I get my

506
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,620
game informer soon because you know friggin a everyone gets theirs before me

507
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:40,340
I haven't got my new issue of you know Xbox magazine it's already in newsstands

508
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:45,120
So it's like what the hell is the point of subscribing to a magazine then if I'm getting it late?

509
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:50,480
What are the demos on the new Xbox magazine is it with me buying the new Xbox magazines gonna have?

510
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,800
What was the 360 demo on there? It was something good. It was I

511
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,400
want to say the 360 version of

512
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,620
Hitman blood money I want to say is on there I

513
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,280
Can't be positive, but I thought that's what it was. I do know it has hit man on there as a demo

514
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:14,280
I'm not sure if it's current gen or next gen, but, oh god, what else was on there?

515
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,720
Just some really good demos though, but I want to say Hitman was on there.

516
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
I can't remember though.

517
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,680
I looked at it for like half a second, so.

518
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,960
But Game Informer is always good, they're always, you know, the ones.

519
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,320
It's really weird because their website, a lot of the news is like really sketchy.

520
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,760
You know, some of it's, you know, accurate, most of it's not.

521
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,720
But their magazine, it's, you know, pretty accurate.

522
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,780
you know seems to be like they have a lot of exclusives and stuff it's like

523
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:45,420
there's such a separation between the website and the actual magazine but I'm

524
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,800
I don't know all right you ready to hear who won tonight's cage match sure all

525
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,700
right it was a landslide vote tonight and although all three songs got a

526
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,300
pretty fair amount of votes we had a lot of participation tonight thank you

527
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:04,120
chatroom thank you for exercising your democratic right to vote I'm sorry I

528
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,840
I will shove this microphone up your p-hole.

529
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,000
The winning song tonight is X-Noise with the fusion.

530
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,800
There you go.

531
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,520
It was either this or a song that was by Rammstein.

532
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,760
It sounded like it should be in Silent Hill.

533
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,080
And SSJ100Matt would like to remind you,

534
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,160
P. Diddy says, vote or die.

535
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,660
Vote or die.

536
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,280
Even though I don't think P. Diddy voted

537
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,880
in some of the earlier elections.

538
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,600
But hey, it's Diddy now.

539
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:40,600
I'm sorry. Diddy what? Diddy what? Wait, it's just Diddy. He lost the P. Fucking artist.

540
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,660
Someone knocked the P out of him. Stick with a name. Yeah, I know. Just pick a name and

541
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:51,680
stick with it. You know, it's like, you know, they're not like, you know, different clothes

542
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,080
or whatever, or Pokemon cards or something like that. Next to her, your audio is so jacked

543
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,740
up tonight because I had to turn it up for Spike and now that you've got it, you're like

544
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,660
That's exactly what you sound like.

545
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,660
Crambor.

546
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,340
Just take the mic away a little bit.

547
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,340
Nobody needs me.

548
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,340
Because Spike holds the microphone way down here.

549
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,340
Nobody needs me.

550
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,340
But you hold it like you're going to make love.

551
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,340
Nobody needs me.

552
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,340
There you go.

553
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,340
Much better.

554
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,340
Alright.

555
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,700
Hobo, hobo, bot, or whatever.

556
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,700
Winobot.

557
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,700
Winobot.

558
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,780
Alright, we'll allow a chance for Xdefer and Nelly to give their final thoughts since they

559
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,900
didn't get a chance yet, and then we'll get into our cookie message of the day.

560
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,900
Nellie, do you have a final thought?

561
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,900
I learn new things about porn every day.

562
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,900
Exta for your final thought.

563
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,900
Cunts really do look like flowers.

564
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,900
Alright, here it is kids, your fortune cookie message of the day.

565
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,900

00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:48,980
