19861	20301	Orange Lounge Radio
46001	46601	Deja Vu
71630	73432	Final Fantasy XI Game Boy Advance Space Channel 5
98756	101016	I brought along Vib Ribbon, of course, for the PS1.
101056	101697	It's a classic.
101757	103517	That I've seen before, but it is a classic.
103997	107018	Yeah, it's a pretty common one, but on the off chance.
108058	111938	The main one that I was excited to bring to you was Primal Image, which we talked about last week.
111958	112238	That's right.
112278	114999	Primal Image was the Pokemon Snap with supermodels, right?
115679	117239	Yeah, except I played it again.
117279	119620	I mean, they don't really look like supermodels.
119860	120960	Just people.
121540	122700	Supermarket models.
122780	123440	Superwhores.
124180	124561	Yes.
125041	125361	All right.
126121	126801	Sounds awesome.
127631	134594	All right, one system that has gotten a lot of attention lately with all the things you can do with it is the Nintendo DS.
134974	139496	And we thought we'd start this segment of the show off with some hacking news.
139916	142498	Loki, what's going on with Nintendo DS, hack-wise?
142858	147360	Well, hack-wise, you know, they've done some really cool things.
147440	151281	Like at E3 last year, they had this thing called the DS Download Station.
152262	157084	And you can actually download demos of games to your DS.
157819	160501	And these have actually started to roll out into stores now.
161342	167627	And you might see them at a local Best Buy or that type of thing.
168567	172691	The only thing is, if you don't have one nearby, what are you to do?
172911	173691	What are you to do?
174372	175873	Well, build your own.
177174	177714	That's right.
178335	184219	Actually, plans were put up on the internet on how to build your own DS station.
184460	186881	And they have the files out there to do it.
188632	189192	A whole tutorial.
189212	189912	It's pretty simple.
190052	196034	You just basically need to get an RT2500 based Wi-Fi card in your computer.
196555	202737	Or sometimes your laptop will have one too because you can do the PCMI card.
203877	204857	Can I do it on my Apple?
206198	207278	You might be able to.
207338	207858	I'm not sure.
207898	208358	I'll try it.
208719	209199	I'm not sure.
209699	215541	But they have a whole list of stuff that's available to basically do this.
215921	216021	And
217026	223409	All the demos that they have on here, which I'm sure I don't know how they got the demos off the demo station, but they're all the ones that are currently out there now.
223489	226130	Brain training and all that fun stuff.
226230	231312	So if you really want to do it, I wanted to get this done on my laptop so we could actually do it in the studio.
231652	236314	Maybe for next week, but... Isn't it just a matter of time before they figure out a way to beam the games over?
236434	238655	Not just the demo, but possibly the whole freaking games?
238835	241356	I'm not sure if they can store that much on there.
242076	242596	Ah, okay.
242876	244837	But still, you know...
245276	245696	Interesting.
245836	255059	And apparently, though, if you do have a Game Boy Advance flash cart, you can record the games to that, and there's a way around where you can actually play them off of that, too.
255619	257880	Nintendo's probably a little irked at this news.
258721	259921	Probably, yeah.
260621	265883	You know, for those folks who maybe live in a remote part, or maybe, you know, I think what would be very interesting is using this in other countries.
266805	279655	I think some folks who are in other countries like Japan, the UK, who might not be seeing these games for a little while otherwise, and even the demos, can play these long before they're released in those, well, not Japan so much, maybe the UK, released in that country.
279895	281016	Yeah, I think that's pretty cool.
281717	289863	Or the other thing is maybe modify it to put Homebrew on there to play Homebrew games that you can transfer via Wi-Fi without having to have all this fancy stuff.
294961	298884	GamerDude1212 says, Nintendo hates all this piracy stuff.
299064	299825	I don't doubt it.
300345	301226	I don't doubt it at all.
301326	301967	I'm sure they do.
302387	303468	Most companies do hate it.
305009	308092	It's probably not going to be an issue later because think about it.
308452	314837	The virtual console, the fact that the Revolution is going to have Wi-Fi, the fact that it's going to be able to hook up to the DS...
315867	320889	You'll probably be able to download these for free off of the DS, or the Revolution anyways, so what's the big deal?
320969	326010	How cool would that be anyway to, you know, go to Nintendo.com and download something that you can beam?
326230	335773	Forget this whole store, you know, why not bypass the kiosks and stores and be able to download demos to your DS just like you can on Xbox Live, but you do it through your computer?
336173	338854	I think they should be endorsing this stuff, not turning their back on it.
339234	340215	But, yeah, whatever.
340815	341495	What do I know?
343109	348733	I do know this, Xbox Live is going to be doing another free week, but it's during the week of E3.
349153	354617	This time it's not just, I don't think it's just one weekend, I think it's actually doing a whole week, no I'm sorry, it is just one weekend.
354897	357399	But the weekend that they're going to be doing this is May 8th.
358159	360861	No, it is a full week, it's because it's running through May 15th.
361461	369627	And it's going to be sponsored by, well I'm not sure, I thought I saw the name of the sponsor there.
370819	379142	I thought, um, not FIFA, um... Well, FIFA World Cup Soccer 2006 might hit the marketplace during that same week.
379582	384844	It wasn't FIFA, it was a shoe brand that was, um, doing it.
385205	385685	I can't remember.
386425	387565	I'm trying to see if I can find it here.
388806	389146	Adidas.
389306	390166	Adidas, that's it.
390206	390667	They were doing it.
390967	391987	I knew I could find it, yay!
392947	396169	So, Adidas, all day I dream about.
397423	400705	Sorry, my mind just can't help but go there.
401385	403766	Good idea, bad idea to do this during the week of E3.
404527	411571	Because most of the hardcore gamers will be either at E3 or glued to their computers reading updates on E3.
412731	413692	So is this a smart thing to do?
418584	421986	Right now you can go play a demo of it on Xbox Live Arcade.
422086	423247	That would be very cool.
423287	424348	You think they would actually do that?
424748	426409	Play the demos that they're playing at E3?
426789	427590	Download them right now?
427610	428090	No way.
428150	428551	Why not?
428971	430912	Because they just don't do that.
430992	431973	Or maybe limited ones.
432913	437878	Maybe, but is there anything so wrong with putting those demos out there on Xbox Live for everybody to play?
438158	440180	Is it just because the games are usually half finished or what?
440840	444604	There is actually one out on Xbox Live now, the Tomb Raider one.
444804	447687	Right, well they have several of those demos.
447727	458497	I think it would be a good idea, but not like, have it be like a specific download, like you have a certain amount of points, you can download it, something like that.
460017	461398	I mean, how cool would that be?
461739	464481	This is the closest you can get to E3, you know?
465082	465702	Right here in your living room.
465722	467985	Play the same demo they're all playing at E3 right now.
468005	469666	I think that would be great publicity stunt.
469706	477473	Especially since, bless their hearts, they decided to not give everybody who works for anyone who sells video games passes.
478414	482238	So, it is going to reduce the amount of
482738	495372	People who are going to be able to go to E3 Somehow this no-name site got in though, which is amazing We actually report I know, we're a legitimate business, believe it or not We don't work in the garden section at Walmart Exactly
496195	505837	One thing that I could see turning a lot of prospective developers away from that, though, is that the average E3 demo is nowhere near as polished as a demo you might get on a demo disc.
506258	514780	And a lot of people who are casually downloading off the marketplace might be using this as, you know, is this my final decision on purchasing this game?
515340	517280	And that would definitely scare a lot of people away.
517500	520881	You play a demo of an unfinished game, it's not very good.
521261	524302	You don't come back to it six months later when it's really ready to be played.
524582	524822	E3 Demo
545999	546900	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
565868	568709	That would target them and make them feel like they're a part of something.
568829	574492	I think a lot of gamers would really go for, oh, this developer is targeting me, I want to play this.
574572	576453	You know what, we need to start an Xbox development company.
576913	577313	Right now.
579454	580214	I have a better idea.
580234	581475	Green Lounge Gaming.
582155	582735	How about this?
583055	583255	What?
583576	586497	How about we sell 360 games with hamburgers?
586917	587937	Ah, I love this idea.
588398	589038	I love this idea.
590455	591215	Can any of us cook?
591375	592036	Oh, how about this?
592076	592716	No, no, I got it.
592936	593437	Excuse me.
593757	596578	Xbox Live with Super Bacon.
598459	601581	Okay, my stomach has just turned really awfully now.
601621	602361	I feel nauseous.
603802	606463	I feel nauseous too, but now I want Super Bacon.
606683	608104	All right, anyway, moving on.
609244	613507	One Xbox Live, or one Xbox title, I should say, in general has been turning heads is Oblivion.
614087	614527	Right, Loki?
614867	620190	Oblivion has been turning heads, and it's been selling and selling and selling and
620953	622473	I want to say 2.5 million.
622933	623954	That's a lot of copies.
624534	625274	A lot of copies.
625294	627354	You know what I think selling these?
628214	628774	Nude Patch?
629234	629635	Oh yeah.
631115	631975	Is that all there is to say?
632035	632795	It's just sold a lot?
633695	635275	No, not at all.
635396	637276	I'm just bullshitting.
637656	642617	Basically, it's gotten really good scores out of a lot of the magazines that reviewed it.
643537	648898	They've sold over 1.7 million units of Oblivion for the PC and the 360...
650642	653124	since they've shipped from launch.
653664	656586	And it's been on the covers of magazines.
657306	658707	It's just really good.
659067	660989	It's ended world hunger.
661869	665071	It's basically accounted for approximately... It found Osama Bin Laden.
665111	665731	It's amazing.
666752	671195	It accounted for 13% of all PC game sales in the first week since it was released.
671535	675377	And by the way, the other 87% was World of Warcraft, amazingly.
676398	676858	Go figure.
676878	679960	You know what I want to know?
680290	683191	Where the hell is my free feel?
683611	683911	I don't know.
702588	708730	I think we should do all of our games in Commodore 64 Basic because I know how to program in Commodore 64 Basic.
709311	711071	Is there a way we... Oh, Spike's doing this.
711251	711852	You, me, you.
711912	712072	Yep.
712412	718414	Let's program some games in Commodore 64 Basic and somehow find somebody to port them to the Xbox 360.
718554	720155	That would be awesome.
721875	722916	You have banana.
723056	723476	Throw?
724176	724696	YN?
724716	725637	You have bacon.
725657	725757	Eat?
726917	726957	YN?
730959	731719	Syntax Error.
731779	732019	Ready.
735861	744704	Speaking of Xbox Live, Saints Row is going to be having a very large demo going to the Xbox Live Marketplace.
745046	745786	Grand Theft Auto, The Saints Row
762413	763234	Yeah.
763374	767857	It's kinda... It was supposed to be the Grand Theft Auto killer that never freaking came out.
767957	768277	Gotcha.
768298	774422	Well, it's on its way, and it's supposedly gonna have multiplayer, so there's supposed to be a very large demo coming to Xbox Live.
774442	776183	They just don't say when, just sometime before release.
776203	776724	You know what I say?
776744	778045	To hell with the Saints Row.
778065	779225	It's all about Crackdown.
780166	781607	Crackdown is gonna be awesome.
781647	786270	If you've gotten this month's official Xbox magazine, they have a trailer for Crackdown.
786291	786831	It's like...
787639	792783	Grand Theft Auto with basically a superhuman as the lead in it so you can throw cars at people.
793483	797867	Nothing says, give me my money, bitch, than throwing a fucking car into your head.
800209	801590	That takes me back to Narc.
804676	805137	Very good.
806698	808660	The chat room is still talking about this game thing.
808900	812364	You know that we did have somebody make Orange Launch Radio the game already.
812604	813245	That was Illusion.
813305	815127	One of our fans actually made that, and it's in the forums.
815427	817449	But now people want to take this to the next level.
817509	821273	DJ PooEater says that he knows the Flash programming.
821553	822715	I know DarkSakura knows that too.
822995	824296	Maybe we could have them team up.
824636	825597	I know how to do ads.
826438	827098	Oh, but not the programming.
827118	828419	And I know how to do slideshows.
828439	830079	Well, maybe you could do the art and he could do the programming.
830219	831940	I'm halfway through my flash semester.
832260	834201	You can make an awesome opening cinema.
834721	835241	There you go.
836221	836782	There you go.
837282	838022	I love this idea.
838042	839503	Can I do it for my homework?
840243	840483	Sure.
841843	843324	If I get school credit for it, okay.
845301	846242	Check that out on the forums.
846262	847482	I think Illusion still has that up.
847982	851924	I'm supposed to put it on our MySpace or our website as well, though.
852144	852984	I totally forgot.
853024	856786	I forgot to send them a private message saying we can move it and suck our own bandwidth away.
858026	859126	It's fabulous.
859387	860507	It's a text adventure.
860947	863668	It's the most fun you'll ever have playing Orange Lounge Radio the game.
863888	865629	You had me at text adventure.
867029	867750	I'm invincible.
870471	872432	Every time I type in an attack, nothing would happen.
872612	873512	Spoiler alert!
875026	876347	Oh my god, spoilers.
876507	880328	I can't believe you ruined the Orange Lounge radio game for everybody.
880348	881409	I didn't say what happened.
881449	882449	I just said I'm invincible.
884310	885730	And you know what happens on page 290?
886811	888051	Jamie kills Dumbledore.
888111	888731	It's amazing.
889612	890512	That's not a spoiler.
891773	892973	I didn't say what happens in the game.
892993	893953	I just said I'm invincible.
894714	895034	Alright.
895414	896114	Aerith died.
896915	897695	And I cheered.
898769	901130	I still have my memory card saved.
901231	903352	Okay, you've told this story five times on the show.
903992	907454	More than that, but I still think that... It's like one of her crowning moments.
907794	909295	It's something I'm very proud of.
910336	911637	I still have my file.
911897	914318	You should sell that card on eBay, that memory card.
914458	915039	Hell no!
915079	917240	Jamie's saved game at Dead Aerith.
917500	919882	No, no, no, this memory card is special.
919902	920322	I'd buy it.
920722	922803	It's my first memory card I ever had.
922883	924164	It's an off-brand one.
924564	925805	It has a Sakura sticker on it.
928693	934339	and it has all of my old Tekken 3 save files and bus to move.
935900	938062	So yeah, that memory card is special to me.
938743	940665	Oh, and my Symphony of the Night files with 210%.
940705	940845	Dork.
940865	941045	Alright.
945174	950795	DarkSakura likes to travel the world from her computer because she has buddies over in the UK and she doesn't want them to feel left out.
950955	955456	So she serves some of the UK news sites to find out what's going on in gaming in the UK.
955736	956656	What's going on in gaming.
956816	960357	But of course, you know, what goes on over there often affects what happens over here.
960477	963657	So we don't like to think of it as necessarily UK only news.
963717	965578	It's just news from the UK.
965818	966638	Nice disclaimer.
967298	967718	You're welcome.
969098	971419	I find I have to use them quite frequently with you.
972139	973719	Hey, what's that supposed to mean?
974386	974666	Nothing.
974746	975026	Heart.
975206	976306	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
977707	979547	You need to just be nice to me because I hurt.
979727	980027	Heart?
980207	981627	Don't make heart signs at me.
981687	984028	That's not going to make me... It's the OLR gang sign.
984048	984568	A little heart.
985828	987708	I think this should be the official OLR gang sign.
988008	988989	Make a heart with your hands.
989049	991609	If you don't know how to do it, we'll take a picture.
991629	992469	You're retarded then.
992689	993689	There is a picture... Shut up!
994850	995730	There is a picture of you.
996490	996830	Doing that?
997150	997650	Doing hearts.
997730	998010	Sweet.
998230	998650	From the club.
998970	999230	Sweet.
999350	1000030	I'll put it up online.
1000651	1002671	You also look really silly in that picture too.
1002731	1003111	You can't use...
1003959	1007802	No, I'm going to do Brazil News now.
1009284	1012907	It's a Polish developer called Nibris, I guess is how it's pronounced.
1013207	1021534	They're working on a film noir inspired game for the revolution called Sadness, which I automatically want to play it because it's very emo and goth.
1023296	1026258	But they are basing it off of movies like Sin City.
1027839	1030641	And they're saying the whole game is going to be done in black and white.
1030782	1032803	It's set before the World War.
1034004	1037667	We don't get any of the depression prohibition stuff.
1038268	1042431	But you get to complain about different things.
1042571	1043532	Sin City the game what?
1043972	1046415	It's based off of movies like Sin City.
1046475	1046815	Oh, okay.
1049397	1050598	Did we get chicks with guns?
1050618	1052860	Because that was the best part of Sin City was chicks with guns.
1053356	1054157	Chicks with a Sword
1066075	1067096	I haven't seen Sin City.
1067476	1068096	Spoiler!
1068376	1069957	You haven't seen Sin City.
1069977	1071478	What is your problem?
1071558	1073679	You need to go out right away and see this movie.
1073719	1077121	I have something called Life, and I've had the movie since it came out on DVD.
1077181	1080203	I feel Sin City was slightly overrated, but it's worth seeing.
1080243	1081944	It's worth your time.
1082024	1083205	On a rainy day.
1083745	1086587	I have this thing that's called Life, where I go to school.
1086627	1093571	Next time you're sick with whatever plague you catch next, on the couch, instead of Kingdom Hearts 2, put that down and watch Sin City for a little bit.
1094424	1094845	Ace Combat on PSP
1110749	1116835	Ace Combat X, Skies of Deception, and I think it is X and not 10 because they haven't gone up to past 5.
1119317	1122400	So it's going to be on the PSP.
1123021	1129967	It's a combination campaign-based single-player plane thingy with wireless multiplayer.
1130107	1134712	And speaking of numbers, I have not played one Ace Combat game.
1135467	1136488	I have Ace Combat 4.
1139230	1142312	I actually, wasn't the first one on Super Famicom?
1143933	1147115	I have not played one Ace Combat game, original PlayStation.
1147856	1148156	That's right.
1148316	1150298	No, it's another game I'm thinking of.
1151578	1152159	Anyway, it doesn't matter.
1152759	1154601	If it's not Top Gun, I don't care.
1155201	1156062	Dude, Top Gun was awesome.
1156082	1157362	Top Gun's coming out for the DS.
1157703	1159524	Fuck yeah!
1159924	1162066	But is it going to be incredibly difficult to land?
1162699	1165641	How hard is it going to be to refuel your damn plane?
1167082	1167602	Don't remind me.
1167782	1168123	Nightmares.
1169704	1179170	Famitsu stated that Namco said that Skies of Deception will feature an original storyline all told through CG.
1180851	1187075	You'll be a pilot in the Griffith Squadron of the Federal Republic of Aurelia.
1187998	1194521	Yeah, four planes, the F-14D Super Tomcat, Tornado F-3, F-2A, and MIG-31 Foxhound.
1195641	1196142	Foxhound.
1196162	1198383	You know what they need to tie it in with?
1199123	1200944	Ace Combat 6 Oblivion.
1202684	1203085	Shut up.
1204665	1208987	So it's actually slated to be out this fall in Japan.
1210228	1210468	Hot.
1210988	1211548	Guess what?
1211969	1212149	What?
1212329	1213229	MMOs!
1213489	1215650	Oh goody, another crack for me to get addicted to.
1215730	1216911	Pirates of the Caribbean.
1217131	1217351	Ooh!
1218123	1219344	which I think is going to be kind of key.
1219444	1220725	I already played Puzzle Pirates.
1221746	1222206	You know what?
1223887	1224948	Yeah.
1226129	1228251	I used to bilge and bilge and bilge.
1228291	1228751	Oh, sorry.
1228831	1234976	You were fussing at me for not doing the stupid thing and I changed it and then you decided to change the subject and what the fuck?
1238479	1239759	Sorry, Miss Dark Sakura.
1241020	1241641	Damn straight.
1242562	1246785	So, as I was saying before Rob so rudely interrupted me,
1248069	1248869	What were you saying anyway?
1249950	1251551	You were talking about Pirates of the Caribbean.
1251571	1252231	You better go.
1254912	1255672	Disney.
1256313	1257073	We love Disney.
1258794	1267518	They announced the PC MMO Pirates of the Caribbean Online will be there to show at E3, but not on stores until 2007.
1268698	1276202	It was supposed to launch with the next film coming out, Dead Man's Chest, in the summer, but it's going to be later this year.
1277512	1279374	The speculation is that it'll be out with the third film.
1280254	1284437	You can create your own pirate and interact with the characters from the movies.
1287219	1289640	Hundreds of customizations available.
1289760	1294363	Buried Treasure, Scary Pirates, and a subscription.
1294603	1295584	Scary Pirates 2?
1297285	1299106	You know why I want to get this game the day it comes out?
1300007	1301648	So I can have a character named Arr.
1302468	1302649	Arr.
1303349	1304850	I want a character named Ger-Arg.
1304870	1306271	I just want Arr.
1306661	1308041	Our Buffy fans will know this.
1309062	1310502	Yes, unfortunately they will.
1311302	1313643	I'm going to actually hunt this one down to check out at E3.
1314963	1320505	And last but not least, everybody's favorite part, release dates.
1324166	1325887	Because release dates make for the happy.
1329568	1334089	Since I didn't get to mention anything that came out last week, the only thing really worth mentioning is
1335426	1362925	Dragon Quest Journey of the Cursed King, Daxter Mega Man Battle Network 5 That's about it Coming up this upcoming week On the 20th we have Final Fantasy XI Treasures of Art Erg Blah Art Ergen That's what I'm calling it anyway 99 Nights on Xbox 360 Desperados 2, Cooper's Revenge, Dragon Ball Z, Shin Budokai Electroplankton Woohoo
1364870	1368953	More Final Fantasy XI than you can stick at on the 21st.
1370814	1375778	And actually, to correct myself, the Desperados, Dragon Ball Z, Electroplankton, those are all on the 21st.
1376238	1378780	We also have Iron Warriors, Rogue Trooper, SOCOM 3.
1379821	1383564	We have Spellforce 2, Shadow Wars on the PC, State of Emergency 2.
1384364	1385185	Tamagotchi!
1385926	1387767	When is Tamagotchi going to freaking die? !
1388553	1391634	I mean, they made up for it with... Give one to me, I manage to kill them all the time.
1391814	1393215	They made up for it with Digimon.
1393335	1395535	I actually have one of the old, original Digimon.
1395595	1396036	It's great.
1396776	1398556	And yeah, also on the 21st Tetris DS.
1399557	1400717	For the DS.
1402598	1403098	Imagine that.
1403858	1404639	Oh, what a shock.
1405099	1407139	And then also Jamie's birthday, the game.
1408380	1409180	Celebrated worldwide.
1410121	1410441	Alright.
1411101	1411381	Loki!
1412790	1414290	There's nothing coming out this week.
1414710	1416231	Not except for Final Fantasy XI.
1416451	1417311	Both of them.
1417331	1418691	360 and the expansion on PlayStation 2.
1419211	1419912	And then the PC.
1419932	1424693	But other than that, really, there is nothing coming out this week.
1424853	1428513	No other games that are worth a damn... Oh, actually, I should take that back.
1428533	1431194	There's going to be... What was it?
1431414	1433835	Dream Falls coming out on the Xbox this week.
1433855	1435955	But other than that, there's nothing.
1437335	1438075	Slow news week, huh?
1438095	1439396	Tokyo Extreme Race or Drift.
1440236	1440676	That's it.
1441533	1443654	Alright, tell us about another MMO, Loki.
1443694	1446275	We had DarkSakura talking about Puzzle Pirates 2.
1448476	1451078	Puzzle Pirates... Never mind.
1451498	1452939	You were the addict to Puzzle Pirates.
1453219	1453999	It was a fun game.
1454019	1461403	I would like to announce that they actually announced the MMO last year at E3.
1462644	1469227	They gave out these stupid gold coins that you would get to go have special access to the...
1470632	1472413	Show Floor, or something, this year.
1473293	1475474	So, yeah, we knew it was coming.
1475934	1482657	Anyways, we didn't know what was coming, though, was this game coming from Acclaim, who's doing a martial arts MMO.
1483857	1485738	That's right, martial arts MMO.
1486759	1487239	No one cares.
1487819	1492661	Anyways, it's going to be called Nine Dragons, being developed by Indie21.
1494162	1500144	And it's supposed to be to put gamers in their own kung fu fighting online game.
1501246	1504487	Sounds kind of like, was it Matrix Online to me?
1505467	1506808	Because that game is all Kung Fu.
1508228	1512749	Anyways, it's currently planned to be released later this year.
1513169	1514670	So, look for that.
1518111	1519671	First off, why are there so many MMOs?
1519851	1526173	I mean, because not only do you get the sucker to buy the game at first, but then you get them to pay for it every month.
1526333	1526773	That's why.
1528034	1529214	Because we keep buying them.
1531129	1531409	I guess.
1534152	1535813	Where's my Blaster Master MMO?
1537414	1543299	You might remember one very popular MMO started on a Dreamcast, on the Dreamcast, that was Phantasy Star.
1543479	1547983	Although I don't know if I'd call Phantasy Star so much an MMO as it is like a multiplayer experience.
1548743	1553707	It's a multiplayer repetitive action game, which I actually still occasionally play.
1555322	1563647	A story from Retro Gaming has been circulating the blogs, video game stuff out there this week.
1564027	1567108	It's games that defined the Dreamcast.
1567389	1570710	So I thought maybe we could nerd out a little bit and talk about the Dreamcast for a minute.
1571031	1573912	What do you think are some games that defined the Dreamcast?
1574152	1580536	Since you mentioned Phantasy Star Universe, I'd like to mention that Phantasy Star Universe is supposed to be coming out on October 25th.
1580936	1581956	One of the ones I forgot to mention.
1581996	1583057	Is that from your little list there?
1583157	1583397	Yeah.
1583477	1584078	Alright, there you go.
1584638	1584718	Um...
1585134	1585734	Blue Stinger.
1588096	1591398	And I'm referring specifically to the Japanese version because the US version was ass.
1591638	1595741	As in not even a nice one, as more like a stinky unwashed ass.
1596762	1597542	Thank you for that visual.
1599744	1605788	The Japanese one had these really massive camera angles, just cinematic.
1606068	1613193	And even though the gameplay was pretty, you know, beat thingy with stick, lightsaber...
1613945	1615426	Run Up A Tower, blah, blah, blah.
1616327	1618229	The camera angles, I thought, were just so neat.
1618269	1627636	It was such a different experience playing that as opposed to a lot of the stuff that was on the PlayStation because, you know, you scroll out too far on PlayStation, it would just completely look crap.
1627756	1630458	But it's kept such a good look.
1630478	1634342	I mean, it made it difficult to play in places, but, you know, I actually liked Boostinger.
1634822	1639185	I traded my copy of the Dragon Ball GT game.
1640346	1640627	All right.
1640847	1642568	Which at the time was stupid because it was going for $150 on eBay.
1643891	1644651	Oh, we all make mistakes.
1645671	1648152	Loki, Spike, any defining Dreamcast games for you?
1648732	1654533	Power Stone, Crazy Taxi, and Jet Set Radio.
1655193	1658734	That's another... Crap.
1660474	1661434	Evolution, actually.
1662394	1666755	I thought, because it brought out... Actually, Grandia 2 was also another good one.
1666935	1668316	Space Channel 5.
1669196	1670736	Spike, anything that comes to mind for you?
1673323	1675892	So Project Justice definitely comes to mind.
1676133	1676775	Amen!
1677377	1679463	The Japanese one with the little board game.
1680006	1680306	Yes!
1680606	1683048	That was so much fun, and you could customize your character.
1683228	1683768	You know what, though?
1683808	1689212	I have to admit, I was a little upset that we didn't have another school life mode, like the Japanese PlayStation games.
1689632	1694936	The, um, yeah, the second rival schools, the Shiri to Justice Kakouen that they did?
1694996	1695236	Yeah.
1695456	1698178	I actually, I paid 90 bucks to import that thing.
1698438	1698578	Me too.
1698598	1700699	Because I had such a hard time finding it.
1701380	1703401	And I love playing through the high school mode!
1703721	1705903	And I got wished happy birthday by Batsu.
1706323	1709145	Aw, see, I was always trying to get Nagare to fall in love with me.
1710450	1711031	I never did.
1711251	1726654	But it's the game that gave us, uh, the, uh, you could play as, uh, Ran, as Ran, as, uh, Nagare, um, but, uh, but, uh, Moaru, uh, Justice Kakuen gave us, um, Zaki, who was
1728750	1737492	I actually, one of my first pieces of fan art that ever got published by another site was one of the big rival schools websites took a fan art I did of Zaki.
1737792	1740153	You're listening to the Geeky Dreamcast Gamer Podcast.
1740713	1745334	And of course, we've got to mention DDR Second Mix Club version.
1746854	1748395	That was my first DDR that I owned.
1748535	1752616	Extover wants to participate in tonight's show by naming, I guess, something, a Dreamcast game?
1753376	1756297	I'm surprised that you didn't name it, but Sonic Adventure.
1757317	1757537	Right?
1760202	1761343	Gutsu's Voice
1787927	1788107	Icaruga
1810276	1832815	The Dreamcast Direct version of Vampire Chronicles, much better than the Chaos Tower BS, super long load time PSP version There was also the For Matching Service series of Street Fighter games Yes, which, you know, SNK vs. Capcom 2, you know, because the game was messed around on the Naomi board Guilty Gear X, absolutely, although, you know Virtual On
1834332	1834833	Oh yes!
1835154	1838098	And if you've got the twin sticks, oh yeah.
1838379	1841644	I actually, I bought the little Saturn adapter so I could use my Saturn twin sticks.
1841744	1843066	I still need Saturn twin sticks.
1843146	1843747	Alright, nerds.
1843767	1845430	Did you ever have Dreamcast sex?
1846451	1846712	Alright.
1847208	1847548	Stop it.
1847949	1850690	Nerds, we've got to get to the chatroom feedback here.
1850750	1852852	Dark Knight says SNK vs. Capcom 2.
1853893	1856094	HitStun says Metropolis Street Racer.
1857415	1860577	TigerClaw says Don't Forget Crazy Taxi on the Dreamcast.
1862679	1864500	Amplitude says MVC 2.
1865220	1866401	Lots and lots of good choices.
1866581	1868542	GS191 hit the nail on the head.
1868643	1869083	Seaman.
1871051	1897860	The original story named these games, Soul Calibur, Shenmue, Jet Grind Radio, Space Channel 5, Crazy Taxi, Virtua Tennis and Tennis 2K2, Skies of Arcadia, the both Power Stone games, both Sonic Adventure games, Samba de Amigo, hello, we started as a music thing, we should have known about that one, Virtua Fighter, Echo the Dolphin, Defender of the Future, Choo Choo Rocket, Phantasy Star Online, Street Fighter 3 Third Strike, Ikaruga,
1898519	1900741	and import games like Rez.
1903142	1903763	There was Rez.
1903963	1904483	Good stuff.
1905204	1907365	Alright, that was our Dreamcast geeky moment.
1907585	1907905	Enjoy.
1908125	1911248	Actually, I do have one of the crappiest games ever for Dreamcast.
1911348	1911728	Shenmue?
1912188	1913269	No, it was import only.
1913329	1914089	Super Producers.
1915530	1918072	Where you manage the career of a pop idol.
1918532	1920153	You know what my favorite Dreamcast game is?
1920794	1921514	DC Ness.
1924556	1924977	Definitely.
1925037	1925557	Definitely.
1927535	1928776	You know what else game came out?
1928816	1931197	Was the roommate 2-1-3 or something?
1931597	1933437	Where you play as some guy's roommate?
1934818	1936279	I thought of a really, really good one.
1936339	1937119	I thought of a really good one.
1937619	1938500	The Typing of the Dead.
1938800	1940060	Typing of the Dead!
1940080	1940140	Yay!
1940800	1941621	Yay, I win.
1941661	1943882	I get to participate in the geeky chat.
1944002	1947323	It also has spawned some of the best cosplay ever.
1948183	1951845	I plan on eventually doing some cosplay once people kind of forget about that game.
1952185	1953746	All right, we really, really got to move on.
1953806	1954106	I'm sorry.
1954126	1954346	All right.
1954807	1958929	Some people are saying that the Xbox 360 is kind of a new version of the Dreamcast.
1958969	1959289	I don't know.
1959349	1959869	Take it or leave it.
1960210	1964272	But what's going on with Burnout on the Xbox 360, Loki?
1964732	1968915	They finally, finally fixed it.
1969475	1974898	So now I can play the damn car I downloaded off the Xbox 360 kiosk months ago.
1976259	1977180	Stupid bastards.
1977780	1981322	Teasing me at the damn car they'll be able to play when they get the game and couldn't play it for months.
1982990	1990036	Anyways, but they did add some new cars to download as well online, so you can get a bunch of cars that they've whored out from different sponsors.
1990897	2002947	And one of the updates, well, other than the cars on the kiosks working now, you cannot spam your recommended clips to people on your recent players list.
2003207	2005129	In other words, people that you just played in games.
2005149	2006890	You can't go, hey, look at my clip that I made.
2007010	2007551	That sucks.
2007611	2008671	I just want to get achievements.
2008832	2009252	So there.
2011906	2013447	I was sitting here like, what's yellow card?
2013467	2014367	Thank you, Rob.
2014407	2014828	You're welcome.
2038601	2040802	I did check it out a little bit.
2041483	2044364	But the only thing that I don't like is you have to unlock the cars in the game.
2045845	2046726	So, that kind of sucks.
2046966	2047206	Alright.
2050068	2050848	Go check that out.
2051108	2051588	Download it.
2051668	2052049	Enjoy it.
2052909	2054810	One person that will probably not be playing... Yes?
2055030	2057492	The chatroom just made me happy because they remembered Rod Caliber.
2058732	2059052	Dorks.
2059552	2060353	We're done with Dreamcast.
2060373	2060913	We're done with Dreamcast.
2060933	2063254	I know, but it has a special place in my heart.
2063414	2065355	We can never be done with Dreamcast.
2065535	2069477	One person that never touched a Dreamcast, you can be certain, is Jack Thompson.
2069537	2072118	And what's Jack up to this week, DarkSakura?
2072298	2074199	Jackie Poo is being a poopy head.
2075359	2075840	Oh, I'm sorry.
2075920	2076840	Professionalism, right.
2078601	2081742	Well, he's filed suit against the Florida Bar Association.
2082863	2083123	So...
2084469	2092091	Basically, as reported by a daily business review, also reposted with GamePolitics, who are our heroes.
2092451	2092931	Oh, we love them.
2093231	2103614	Yeah, he's filed a million-dollar federal lawsuit against the Florida Bar saying that the organization is harassing him by investigating his baseless complaints.
2105074	2106594	One million dollars!
2109335	2113196	But, and I love what GamePolitics commented on this, just to quote,
2113891	2119162	We're glad someone enjoys what Jack does but we've reread the First Amendment umpteen times and still can't find the right to annoy people.
2122008	2122349	Amen.
2123600	2125582	I love this post in our forums.
2125782	2127043	If I could read this from our forums.
2127124	2130707	I love this listener.
2130747	2132508	He makes a lot of great posts on our forums here.
2132588	2134050	The Ichiban Crush.
2134210	2136292	He posted the bunny picture on my MySpace.
2136632	2139074	We love our listeners, and this guy's just living proof.
2139094	2140035	I love this post he made.
2140496	2144319	Regarding Jackie Poo, I actually hope no one makes a game to his description.
2144339	2149744	This is a follow-up to last week's story where we talked about the whole Jack Thompson hates joystick and all that.
2150384	2152706	Because with his last modest proposal, what did he do?
2153047	2156950	Back out of his promise of donating $10,000 to charity when someone called his bluff.
2157350	2163955	Oh, and let's not even get into the hissy-fits he targeted towards everyone who pointed out Jack's lack of credibility or paid the fee on his behalf.
2164376	2171441	Why are we even giving a shit about this parasitic, ambulance-chasing, morally bankrupted, failure of a lawyer and human being anymore?
2171742	2177086	In the grand scheme of things, has he made an ounce of influence in the way we as gamers or the game industry does its thing?
2177406	2178267	No, not at all.
2178587	2181250	What we have here is an over-glorified internet troll.
2181590	2182832	Nothing more, nothing less.
2183212	2186836	His own actions weaken any and all chance for these holy crusades coming through.
2187156	2191461	This isn't even about fundamentalist antics anymore because it seems even those guys are laughing at him.
2191801	2193503	So no, I wouldn't give him what he wants.
2193803	2196206	More people to cry wolf about to the authorities.
2196506	2197808	It's trolls bait, folks.
2198208	2199069	Don't bite.
2200834	2201094	Love it.
2202576	2202816	Love it.
2202936	2204717	Should we even be reporting on him anymore?
2204818	2205238	I don't know.
2205318	2211523	I feel like we have an obligation to, but at the same time, I totally get the village idiot perspective.
2212624	2213185	I'm sick.
2213585	2217128	I'm really sick of everything having to do with his name coming up.
2217168	2221272	We dealt with him in the mid-90s over the whole cop killer thing for Ice-T.
2223314	2224935	And now we're dealing with him over video games.
2245735	2253522	I don't see, you know, of course people are going to complain about him because he's displayed this utter lack of professionalism in all of his dealings with everybody.
2254182	2263550	And, you know, people have reposted emails where he has just completely gone to name-calling and finger-pointing like a freaking schoolyard bully, you know.
2263931	2266273	That's all he is, is an overblown bully.
2268383	2271728	All he's trying to do is keep his name in the spotlight.
2271768	2273731	This isn't about helping families.
2273771	2276175	This isn't about cleaning up America.
2276276	2279941	This is about keeping money in his pocket and the spotlight on him.
2280748	2288814	You know, one thing, though, that I guess is good, a good thing that comes from all this reporting on this guy is it really does bring the game community together in really interesting ways.
2288894	2292056	Take that whole, you know, Pixelante thing, the flowers for Jack.
2292817	2298120	At least there's that good, that little silver lining that comes out of it as it brings people together out of their hatred for this guy.
2298220	2304305	Well, what he needs to also keep in mind that the majority of people who buy video games are in our age group.
2305250	2308373	The people in this room, we are the ones who are paying for these games.
2308933	2310715	We are the ones who are doing a lot of the playing.
2310755	2315760	And true, yeah, a lot of teenagers and younger kids are playing games.
2316260	2318983	But we're the ones who've been keeping the industry going.
2319043	2320144	We were there from the beginning.
2320885	2326330	And like I've brought up before,
2327143	2333628	There has been so much concrete proof to refute everything he's saying and he just refuses to accept fact as fact.
2334529	2335930	I honestly am sick of him.
2336130	2339773	I'm sick of how utterly stupid he is.
2340113	2344777	He's proof that one can have a college education and still be retarded.
2346834	2349276	You can address those cards and letters to DarkSakura.
2349296	2350137	Please do.
2350838	2353020	If he emails anybody, email me.
2353100	2354662	I will tell you exactly what I think about you.
2354862	2357144	Mailbag at OrangeLawnRadio.com if anybody wants to comment.
2358083	2359905	The U.S.
2359965	2362567	isn't the only place where video games are investigated.
2363527	2370813	Japan's National Police Agency is currently investigating the effects playing video games and watching anime has on children.
2371173	2377838	This is being led by a former Deputy Governor of Tokyo, Yutaka Takahana.
2379139	2385303	These guys met on April 10th in Tokyo to discuss violent video games and sexual content on the internet.
2385883	2398430	Previously, though, there really hasn't been a whole lot of controversy in Japan regarding the in-game violence, but this current generation of games, of course, Grand Theft Auto and so on, sort of brings this back to the spotlight there.
2400606	2410494	Also, it should be pointed out, the sale of Grand Theft Auto 3 was actually banned from being sold to anyone under the age of 18 in two separate Japanese prefectures.
2410975	2418901	So, and so on, so they're just doing this study here, I guess seeing if maybe they need to be a little more tighter on this stuff in Japan.
2421023	2422064	I don't know, doubt it'll happen.
2422124	2427508	I think the only thing anime does is just warp our sense of what kind of women we can achieve, you know.
2428246	2430908	and women don't have breasts that are that big.
2431829	2433070	At least not that many of them.
2434291	2437474	And also, tentacle rape is not good.
2439139	2445566	All this stuff about the laws and the people that keep talking about this stuff, it just makes me angry.
2445626	2448770	I don't know about you guys, but I get a little bit angry when I think about this stuff.
2449070	2455537	And so that's why we have a segment here on Orange Lounge Radio dedicated to getting a little bit of this angst out of our system.
2455977	2457419	And it's called the FUs of the Week.
2457819	2459501	Are you ready to get angsty, boys and girls?
2473717	2503350	DarkSakura F you to whatever that fatigue shit I had was earlier in the week because it sucked I actually like being able to get out of bed and do stuff and I hate missing the show so yeah just F you to whatever has caused the weird random fatigue I had Loki F you to the amount of alcohol I drank last night because that sucked and F you to certain sites
2504383	2508844	Thank you.
2513805	2514165	Spike!
2515445	2516245	Do you have any FUs?
2517265	2519166	FU to cellular phones that don't work.
2520866	2522226	That would make me angry too.
2523126	2528007	My FU this week goes to Loki for not singing karaoke last night, despite how drunk we got him.
2529267	2531468	You'll have to kill me for this, you big pussy.
2532188	2533328	Will you sing when you die?
2534508	2534788	Maybe.
2536888	2538189	He'll sing when he's dead.
2540769	2541129	Loki!
2542369	2545470	Sing to us a little bit about Nintendo DS's other news.
2546270	2548510	The DS is getting a TV... No, I said sing.
2549851	2550471	I'm just kidding, go ahead.
2550491	2552171	The DS is getting a TV tuner.
2553271	2556012	A TV tuner the size of an Xbox.
2556952	2558852	No, the TV tuner is ginormous.
2559932	2563253	And, yeah, it's not very portable.
2564059	2565840	But if you're interested, it is available.
2566560	2569362	And apparently, well, I don't know.
2569942	2572423	It's being reported by Famitsu Magazine.
2572663	2573424	They have a picture of it.
2574404	2576865	And it literally is bigger than a DS.
2578266	2579727	And we're talking old DS.
2581368	2581588	Wow.
2583029	2588872	And apparently, you know, if it's like any of the other TV tuners out there, probably doesn't get very good reception.
2590873	2591193	Alright.
2592193	2593654	So why would anybody want to buy this?
2594445	2595407	I don't know, fair enough
2600143	2603664	All right, also coming to the DS, Sudoku Gridmaster.
2604264	2606645	Nintendo recently announced that they're going to be putting this out.
2606865	2612707	It's going to have over 400 puzzles and use the DS's touchscreen and handwriting recognition software.
2613027	2616368	You'll have practice mode, easy mode, normal, and hard mode.
2617108	2618248	The game is supposed to come out June 26.
2618328	2622650	What I'm not sure of, though, is if that means Japan or the US.
2623270	2627031	And I'm thinking, come on, another freaking Sudoku game?
2627791	2632072	I think the only way this game would sell is if they made it look like Tetris DS.
2632092	2634853	Like, put 16-bit Nintendo characters in it.
2634993	2636693	Oh, it's Mario presents Sudoku!
2636753	2639274	And then it would sell like freaking crazy.
2639454	2640054	What do you want to bet?
2641134	2646635	Sudoku, just put Link on it, put Zelda's face on it, do something, and people will eat that shit up.
2646695	2647116	It's the Nintendo way.
2647136	2647996	The legend of Sudoku.
2648096	2649456	That's the legend of Sudoku.
2650656	2652437	I'm going to name my firstborn Sudoku.
2652797	2652957	Why?
2654600	2654960	I'm not.
2655861	2658682	But I am naming my... When I have a son, I'm naming him Richter.
2659222	2660063	After Richter Belmont.
2660083	2660803	Because you're a geek.
2661403	2663784	Can you pronounce it like the bad English dub?
2663905	2664525	Richter.
2664645	2665345	Richter.
2666466	2668487	Where you have to wipe out your eye every time you talk to Maria.
2668927	2670788	Thank you for knowing where I was going with that.
2671028	2674990	Before DarkSakura coughs up a lung there with the Richter thing...
2677802	2679726	The Grudge is like two years old now, stop.
2680087	2684195	Although they do make a reference to The Grudge in Scary Movie 4, which came out on Friday.
2684235	2685197	Yes, but I heard it sucks.
2685477	2686479	I thought it was funny.
2687068	2687368	I don't know.
2687828	2688529	You heard wrong.
2689169	2691210	Well, it's a matter of everyone's opinion.
2691250	2692591	What did it get on the tomato meter?
2692631	2693851	That's what I want to know.
2694312	2695492	I really have no interest in seeing it.
2695712	2696693	All right.
2696813	2698894	Loki, more DS, new Mario Brothers.
2698954	2699634	What's happening with that?
2699875	2702896	Yeah, they're going to be having some of the mini games in Mario Brothers.
2703656	2706718	Very similar to what you saw in Super Mario 64 for the DS.
2707018	2709660	To be honest, I think I played the mini games more than I actually played the games.
2710400	2714482	But this time around, you'll actually be able to play the multiplayer, which is pretty sweet.
2715603	2719005	So some mini-game action for you to be shared with friends.
2719986	2720766	That's going to be fun.
2721446	2721787	Can't wait.
2721807	2722947	It's going to be fun-tastic.
2723208	2723848	Fun-tastic.
2725269	2727830	Another friend code for you to have to manage with your friends.
2727890	2728531	That should be a lot of fun.
2728571	2731853	Well, I don't know if it's over the internet.
2731933	2733253	I don't think it's through your Wi-Fi service.
2733293	2734214	I think it's just local.
2735074	2735195	Oh.
2736135	2736395	Lame.
2737356	2737636	All right.
2740011	2748715	DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down researching Dreamcast games, but once in a while she comes on another website that she wants to share with all of you guys.
2748775	2750976	It's DarkSakura's website of the week.
2751256	2754418	And where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week, DarkSakura?
2755258	2768404	This is the site that's had me mesmerized for about three hours as a few people online, Ranma's one of them, can attest to because I kept linking pictures, Snopes.com, S-N-O-P-E-S.com.
2769159	2771041	It's basically an urban legends reference page.
2771381	2772002	It's fabulous.
2773183	2782270	In fact, someone on my... And I knew about this site for a while, but someone actually linked a picture of the world's largest rabbit, who was like as big as a dog.
2783391	2784332	Like a golden retriever.
2785593	2790618	And it's real, and there's lots of interesting pictures in here, like the Cyclops cat, and...
2792842	2794602	A twin, well, a two-headed baby.
2795122	2799144	It actually was like a head and half of a body attached to her head.
2799644	2801145	They actually had the other twin removed.
2802265	2805687	But yeah, I mean, some of this is, you know, there's the fake ones on here.
2805707	2811029	It's basically any urban legend that's been reported and they investigate it and let you know if it's real or not.
2811289	2817033	I love this site because I get those crappy forwards from coworkers all the time of these totally untrue things.
2817634	2824799	And what I'll do is I'll go onto Snopes.com and find the little article, and I'll just copy-paste the link in an email back, and I always reply to all.
2825780	2826120	Good.
2826801	2834026	But just for a little overview, the hottest 25 urban legends as of...
2835174	2837336	This week is there's one about gas.
2837356	2838376	There's the giant rabbit.
2839557	2842960	One about Bill Gates doing a Microsoft and AOL giveaway.
2844040	2845461	And about the brown recluse spider.
2845982	2846962	The effects of the brown recluse.
2848483	2849364	All right.
2849944	2850285	Check it out.
2850325	2854047	It should be required reading for anybody who wants to send a forward email.
2855508	2858410	For the sake of the chat room, I am going to link the giant rabbit story.
2858430	2858751	All right.
2858771	2859131	There you go.
2860572	2862093	Otherwise, you'll have to beg for it in the forums.
2862398	2869702	I forgot to mention when we were talking about useless games and stuff that's coming out this week, Brain Age is actually coming out this week.
2870262	2870682	Oh, is it?
2870862	2871383	Yeah.
2871563	2872743	Oh, it's this week?
2873223	2873664	I believe so.
2873724	2874104	Cool.
2874924	2876465	Well, so much for useless games coming out.
2876485	2877245	I really want that one.
2877526	2878386	It's still not a game.
2879266	2880147	I want to check it out anyway.
2881512	2885595	One game I've always been meaning to check out that I seem to never get around to is Civilization 4.
2886376	2894581	Well, there's actually a patch, see what I'm waiting for is I'm waiting for like the ultimate Civ 4 compilation to come out for 20 bucks in like a year because that's what always happens with Civilization games.
2895041	2900545	But anyway, if you're a rabid Civilization fan who's getting your fix right now, there's a brand new patch.
2900985	2901245	and so on.
2916534	2917575	Subtitles by Subtitle Workshop
2939915	2942618	This is a good one right here, Civilization IV, Make Your Own Scenarios.
2943359	2946203	It is down to $30 if you want to pick up the game.
2946243	2948385	It's down from, I think, $50 when it first came out.
2948425	2951289	It's down to $29.99, or as I call it, $30.
2955534	2956415	Moving on, Loki.
2957316	2957676	Yes.
2957997	2958938	What's making a comeback?
2960148	2963110	Hopefully not a weeble, but Alone in the Dark.
2964350	2971014	I remember they were showing some pictures of Alone in the Dark, the new one, and that actually looked kind of pretty cool, and they have some screenshots up right now.
2971455	2976598	But 1UP is reporting that Alone in the Dark will rear its head on next-gen consoles very soon.
2977218	2979419	Something you probably will see at E3, maybe.
2981301	2982221	But we'll have to wait.
2982241	2986263	They're going to be showing it in, I think, the next Electronic Gaming Monthly.
2987904	2988705	Should be interesting.
2991863	2993004	Are You Alone in the Dark?
2993404	2996407	Yes, and I'm playing a crappy video game called Alone in the Dark.
2996787	2999369	If I remember correctly, I did read a little bit about this.
2999389	3000270	I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
3000330	3009818	It's actually supposed to be set in Central Park in New York in something about I don't remember now, but something paranormal, of course.
3010618	3012260	Violent paranormal hobos?
3013040	3014962	Horrible movies being made.
3016343	3017204	Who's responsible?
3018245	3019926	I want to see Typing of the Dead make a comeback.
3021468	3022388	Sudoku of the Dead
3039980	3043823	There's actually Guitar Room Man on the PSP.
3045885	3054551	Basically, on the Japanese PlayStation site, there's a product posting announcing a second Guitar Room Man.
3054872	3056453	Of course, published by Koei.
3057273	3059095	Koei gave us KO Flying Squadron.
3059135	3059655	I like them.
3060436	3060516	Um...
3061500	3072543	But as Guitar Man Live for the PSP, follow-up to the first Guitar Man that was on PlayStation 2, there's speculation that there's going to be demos at E3.
3073304	3074704	Hopefully, that will be true.
3075124	3077125	I will be living at wherever that is.
3080026	3080226	But...
3083356	3110050	there's very few details out on it right now although there's a new feature that's being advertised that has network play but not online compatible and you can compete head to head or cooperative in duet mode it's supposed to be a bit more balanced the music and vocals are provided by actual Japanese pop stars maybe it'll be someone that we've heard of over here
3111019	3111519	It'll be cool.
3111540	3112420	I think it's going to be pretty cool.
3112880	3113781	I'm looking forward to it.
3114061	3114301	All right.
3114361	3114702	Sounds good.
3115762	3119144	Our Skype line is open over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
3119164	3120225	Click on Interact With Us.
3120665	3122086	So let's pick up some calls.
3122627	3122887	Hello.
3122927	3124208	You are on Orange Lounge Radio.
3125128	3125429	Sweet.
3125489	3126249	I'm the first one on.
3126289	3126849	It's Ranma.
3126950	3127470	Hi, Ranma.
3127490	3128030	What's on your mind?
3128791	3129271	Not much.
3129331	3132273	I want to cover a couple of things and I'm on my way out of here.
3133013	3133614	Runtime.
3134540	3135540	Hi, Ukyo!
3136601	3137421	Alright, stop.
3137941	3139102	Less love, more news.
3139182	3139522	What's up?
3139922	3140262	Hey!
3140362	3150846	Alright, I want to talk about the Xbox emulator, and I can explain better why it's taking it so long to convert games, make them all compatible and stuff.
3152647	3153927	Oh yeah, what is up with that?
3155228	3158669	On the 360, very few games are compatible.
3158689	3159209	What's up with that?
3159850	3163131	Yeah, from my knowledge of working with computers and technology, it's like this.
3163960	3169563	Xbox is Pentium 3 and Xbox 360 is like a core cell processor, something like that.
3170003	3173905	Basically, the emulator has to convert the coding and stuff so it'll work.
3174665	3181928	As for the graphics processor, that part really doesn't matter per se because even though it's optimized for NVIDIA, it's still like a generic graphics set.
3181948	3185810	It'll still work on the quote-unquote new ATI graphics chipset or whatever.
3185830	3187631	It's not optimized for NVIDIA.
3187671	3189151	It's built by NVIDIA.
3189572	3190312	It's a little different.
3191771	3203937	I still think it's fucked that you can play Barbie and not DDR.
3203957	3204777	I mean, fuck that.
3206098	3206458	I agree.
3206578	3213241	I mean, I understand why, because, you know, they get one game to work, and usually about ten games are very similar to that, but still, it's messed up.
3214081	3214782	It's wrong.
3215102	3215902	It's wrong!
3216543	3217583	I know, I know.
3217603	3219424	Alright, anything else, Ranma?
3220083	3222072	How goes your training against Jack Thompson?
3222092	3224121	I got 51 odds on you to kick his ass.
3225563	3227543	I don't know, he's kind of old and broken.
3227763	3229304	I think I'd win in a fight.
3230264	3233405	No, we don't want to get sued over threatening to fight him or whatever.
3234865	3246087	I'm just speculating that if I had to defend myself, if a rabid Jack Thompson came to Sacramento and wanted to beat me up or give me rabies, then I would win in a fight.
3246268	3247688	He's coming right for us.
3249308	3252549	Jamie, you didn't hear last week's show, did you?
3253289	3254490	I was sort of dead.
3255090	3257011	Rob basically told Jack to bring it on.
3257211	3257932	Oh yeah, that's right.
3257952	3258993	I called Jack out.
3259233	3260694	I said, bring it, bitch.
3260754	3261414	I said, bring it.
3261834	3263875	We would own him so hard.
3263895	3264336	Not physically.
3264376	3265356	I said, we could have a war of words.
3265616	3271080	I said I would be cordial to him and let him have his say, but then he would have to listen to everything I have to say in return.
3271560	3272240	You know what, though?
3272260	3277523	That wouldn't be fair because, well, we would just completely decimate him.
3278144	3278384	I know.
3278664	3281526	You cannot have a battle of wits against an unarmed opponent.
3282506	3283108	Point taken.
3283710	3286560	Alright Ranma, we gotta get some more calls, but thank you so much for the call.
3287162	3287744	No problem.
3287884	3288165	Love it.
3288366	3288968	Love you guys.
3289048	3289369	Bye.
3290270	3295413	Some folks in the chat room are asking, SSJ100, Matt wants to know, did we do peep jousting this year?
3295473	3298916	That's actually something that happened on the old show, Vanilla Sky, one of my spinoff shows.
3299896	3301978	We did not do peep jousting this morning.
3302058	3306961	And for those that don't know what peep jousting is, that is when you, on Easter, actually, you can do this any day.
3307702	3310323	Take some marshmallow peeps, but it's easiest around Easter.
3310604	3317108	Take some marshmallow peeps and stick some toothpicks in them and then put them in the microwave and watch them get really, really, really, really big.
3317128	3320130	And then at one point, one peep has to slaughter the other.
3320530	3321510	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3345239	3347081	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3370011	3370231	Hey.
3370651	3371292	Hi, who's this?
3371992	3373273	This is Did You Lose a Sock?
3373713	3374854	Did You Lose a Sock?
3374914	3375954	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
3375974	3376875	I don't recognize that name.
3376915	3378576	It's very cool.
3378876	3380737	Long time podcast listener.
3380877	3382518	First time listening live.
3382778	3383418	Very cool.
3383439	3384419	Well, welcome.
3384819	3385440	Welcome to the show.
3385460	3386020	Welcome to the madness.
3386380	3386760	Thank you.
3386800	3387301	Appreciate it.
3388181	3390482	I just wanted to call in and say awesome show.
3390522	3391603	Loved it.
3392223	3396606	And I think it's stupid that people think Mac gaming is going to die.
3397745	3399325	That Mac gaming is going to die?
3399925	3403266	I think it's... Oh, because the whole dual boot thing?
3403826	3406947	Yeah, I think people are stupid thinking that it will die.
3407027	3408427	I don't think it will.
3409047	3409488	You know what?
3409528	3412848	Commodore 64 gaming is still not dead in many ways.
3412908	3415629	So Mac gaming will never die either.
3416449	3418189	There's rabid fans for everything.
3418209	3421630	I don't think the dual boot thing is going to take off right away.
3421810	3422851	It's going to be a little while.
3423411	3424851	I think there will still be some good stuff on Mac.
3425979	3432524	Yeah, with the switch to the Intel processor, I think actually porting games will make it a lot easier.
3432664	3435527	So I think we're going to see more games on the Mac.
3435967	3437468	All right.
3438789	3439590	We'll see what happens.
3440090	3440531	I hope so.
3441231	3441492	All right.
3441912	3442412	Anything else?
3443393	3444694	Mr. Sock?
3444754	3445595	Keep up the good work.
3446175	3446516	All right.
3447196	3447797	Thank you very much.
3447837	3449538	We appreciate the ego boost call once in a while.
3450118	3450359	Okay.
3450459	3450639	All right.
3450659	3451099	Have a good one.
3452140	3452881	We like new people.
3453301	3454482	Love it when new people call on the show.
3455384	3457004	Alright, let's go to another call here.
3457064	3458585	We'll go over here.
3459205	3460585	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3461605	3462225	Hey, what's up?
3462465	3463025	Hi, who's this?
3463825	3465526	This is HitStun.
3465646	3466926	Hi, HitStun, what's on your mind?
3466966	3467286	Hello.
3467926	3470167	Hey, I got a couple things I wanted to go over here.
3470287	3470587	Okay.
3470627	3471807	I want to throw out an idea.
3472947	3481068	I noticed earlier today, well, earlier this week, about how Walmart dictates the contents of games.
3481128	3484069	Like, I posted this up on, well, I saw this posted on the forums, too.
3485011	3507485	But like, they can dictate things like... It's cool, I know what article you're talking about, and for some reason it didn't make this week's show roll, but I do remember reading something on it, like Walmart is, when a AA title comes out, Walmart supposedly gets to review the title before it's released.
3508305	3514689	You know why I don't... I think one reason we kind of didn't originally intend on covering it is because I don't know if I believe it.
3516113	3517774	Um, well, I can explain some.
3517854	3518614	Okay, go for it.
3519314	3520955	It's like they only have so much shelf space.
3521295	3526316	Like, they only have room for so many adventure games, so many RPGs, you know, so many strategy games, whatever.
3526816	3529777	And if something isn't popular enough, they're not going to have the room to carry it.
3530858	3532318	So, I had an idea.
3532718	3535579	There should be an independent publisher that's like Cafe Press.
3535619	3540141	You know how Cafe Press does, like, t-shirts and coffee mugs and stuff for whoever.
3540441	3541701	Right.
3541721	3542101	They make it.
3543162	3544442	Someone should do that for video games.
3545404	3546085	That's my idea.
3546806	3547767	Stamp your video game on a 360?
3547807	3550070	Yeah, exactly.
3550250	3556859	Anyone who wants to publish their game should be able to send it to this company and have people order it from the site and get copies of it.
3557240	3558822	I think I'd blow this whole thing wide open.
3559372	3559752	DarkSakura.com
3578795	3579876	I don't know about that baby.
3579936	3582559	I still have my old Zack Bimani t-shirt.
3582659	3584741	You must hand wash that baby or something.
3584901	3586363	No, I run it through the washer.
3586383	3586903	Yeah, take care of that.
3587004	3590047	Here is why Walmart, you know, how they dictate games.
3590507	3592749	Okay, so you have this game coming out called Halo 3.
3592950	3593230	Yeah.
3594211	3596613	Does it have hunting deer in it?
3597534	3598335	Because it doesn't.
3598896	3599737	We don't want to carry it.
3601786	3609271	I don't buy music at Walmart because I don't agree with their... I really don't shop at Walmart in general because I'm such a Target whore for one.
3609631	3611433	And I just think Walmart is nasty.
3611573	3615135	I mean, I don't know about the Walmarts in your neck of the woods, but around here, they are nasty.
3615555	3617396	You walk in and it smells like dirt.
3617757	3620899	When you live in Alabama, Walmart's the primary source of entertainment.
3622420	3622660	I know.
3622720	3625642	I understand that in some areas, Walmart's your only option.
3625682	3626402	I'm not joking.
3626562	3627563	But you guys have online.
3627583	3629484	We've got some nice independent stores here.
3629944	3630205	All right.
3630225	3630685	Well, that's good.
3632188	3637212	And one more thing, I need to pwn you guys a Tetris DS.
3637772	3645398	Any of you who have Tetris DS, like, listen in the chat, or, I know Sky, you got it, I gotta take you out.
3645658	3649481	Let's plan it some way, make a thread in the forums, and we'll plan a night, alright?
3649882	3655546	Yeah, I mean, eh, whatever, I'm not, like, unbeatable or anything, but
3656631	3658032	and I gotta take you guys out.
3658352	3658873	It'll be fun.
3658913	3662735	We like to show our listeners just how bad at video games we really are.
3663776	3666437	But I know you guys can turn around and kill me at Mario Kart.
3666778	3668879	Well, we'll dish it out at some point.
3668919	3669820	Start a thread in the forums.
3669840	3670580	We'll try to make it happen.
3671781	3672601	Alright, thanks guys.
3672682	3673262	Have a good one, buddy.
3673762	3674303	Alright, later.
3674443	3674723	Bye-bye.
3675123	3675723	Okay, okay.
3675944	3678205	Ranma Sani heard my accent.
3679306	3681247	I don't have an accent since I moved to California.
3681267	3682968	And talking about Walmart nonetheless.
3683008	3683388	That's wonderful.
3683408	3683909	Walmart.
3684795	3685135	All right.
3685835	3688076	Thank you guys so much for calling in on the Skype line tonight.
3688096	3691057	We appreciate it, but we've got to get to the last-minute stories.
3691117	3693218	Does anybody have a last-minute story they'd like to share?
3693778	3698059	Yeah, Project Gotham 3 is getting an update on Xbox Live.
3699820	3707922	Basic stuff that they're going to be adding, one of them is the ability to lock the host car in a host car class.
3709023	3711504	So, again, just what kind of car class you're racing as.
3712224	3712604	Also...
3713351	3721236	Added wheel support for some of these brand new steering wheels out there being put out by Madcatz and stuff like that.
3721837	3727681	Also, finally, they're going to be doing spectator mode.
3730803	3731283	So I know that.
3731983	3733284	Fear is coming to the 360.
3733424	3735226	It's supposed to be shown at E3.
3735266	3737767	That's supposed to be the story I think 1UP was talking about.
3737787	3738748	We're going to be
3739298	3740320	PC Games 360 Liberty City Stories
3753945	3756665	I hope that's not true because that game's awesome.
3758246	3762487	I hope it has online multiplayer because I'm going to fucking kick everybody's ass.
3763247	3763827	Everybody's ass.
3764187	3766467	I remember one of the videos that we had of me drunk.
3766847	3770188	Hey, how about a game of Grand Theft Auto right now?
3770208	3773348	I'm like, I'll fucking kick your ass, even if I am drunk.
3774149	3774549	That was fun.
3775489	3776009	DarkSakura?
3777209	3779610	There were 5,400 World of Warcraft players banned.
3780510	3781750	Oh my gosh, what did they do?
3782655	3786437	Basically, they were trying to clamp down on gold farming and cheating.
3786617	3790258	And funeral party raiding.
3790958	3800122	10,700 accounts were suspended for participating in activities that violate the game's terms of use, including using third-party programs to farm gold and items.
3800682	3806985	According to Blizzard, and I quote, such actions can severely impact the economy of a realm and the overall game enjoyment for all players.
3807543	3812806	and selling World of Warcraft content such as gold items and characters can result in permanent ban of the involved accounts.
3812826	3816067	If you want to cheat like that, you better go play Oblivion.
3816467	3821470	However, a new patch, 1.10.1, is released.
3821930	3832115	The Jagged Obsidian Shield is now bind-on equipped, and the Titanic Leggings pattern will now drop slightly less frequently, which is obviously, you know, it's going to...
3833442	3834783	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3859877	3860918	A little bit more news.
3862159	3865941	1.11 is coming out soon, which is basically mage-specific.
3865982	3867302	There will be a talent review.
3868703	3880992	Patch is going to introduce a new 40-man raid dungeon, the Necropolis of Naxxramas, which is home to the Dreaded Lich, unpronounceable name insert here.
3882473	3882733	All right.
3883567	3884908	There's also a little bit more.
3884928	3887491	Capcom's going to be loading us with stuff at E3.
3888572	3889312	And you know what?
3889432	3890714	I hate Firefox all of a sudden.
3891174	3891574	What did it do?
3891594	3892075	Crash on you?
3892255	3892735	Yes!
3892896	3893456	Oh no!
3893736	3894977	So let's see if I can get around this.
3896259	3897820	I'll just go ahead and leave it off of there.
3897840	3900502	Alright, I can do a fill-in real quick if you get to bring it up.
3900523	3902104	Nah, I'm not even going to play with it.
3902845	3903025	Alright.
3904042	3909703	GoNintendo has an interesting little quote from Ubisoft Montreal CEO's Yanis Mallet.
3910143	3916625	I can say definitely as any other developer, we are looking at this magical platform and we want to be a part of the adventure.
3917045	3922446	I'm pretty sure we'll see other Revolution games from Ubisoft and some of them I'm sure will be made from Montreal.
3922746	3927647	So he's quoting there that the Revolution is a magical platform.
3927707	3930007	It's full of magic.
3930667	3933128	And they're going to make magic games.
3934306	3938348	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3964005	3964345	and Spike.
3965586	3966407	Die, monster.
3966587	3968309	You don't belong in this world.
3968970	3972173	And... It was not by my hand that I was given flesh.
3972333	3972913	Nerds!
3974315	3974895	Nerds!
3975976	3976276	Loki.
3978258	3981822	Um... Well... Ooh, video.
3982762	3985605	We'll have to... I'm really trying to get this on the website.
3986085	3986366	Alright.
3987046	3988548	You do that, Mr. Loki.
3989335	3992657	Alright, that's going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
3992717	3999722	Thank you guys so much for downloading us, checking us out, tuning in live, breaking some record numbers for us listening live tonight.
3999742	4001823	I really appreciate that, you guys.
4002383	4005145	Again, all we ask, if you enjoy the show, we do it for free.
4005445	4006305	Just tell a friend.
4006405	4016309	Tell somebody you know about Orange Lounge Radio because that's really the best way for us to advertise because we don't have any big sites backing us and we don't have those ads and things.
4016609	4021770	So unless Loki can manage to leak some more release dates, we don't get attention very often.
4021830	4023311	So we need you guys to help us out.
4024791	4025251	DarkSakura?
4026172	4026872	I almost forgot.
4026912	4027752	Reject false icons.
4027872	4028352	Oh, there you go.
4029053	4030693	And on that note, that's going to do it.
4030973	4031533	Have a good week.
4031714	4033074	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4036812	4039235	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
