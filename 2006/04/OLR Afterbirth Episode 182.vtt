WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
who syndicates our show weekly. We also let them have a crack at this little live

00:03.760 --> 00:04.260
segment.

00:04.260 --> 00:08.520
So tonight we thought okay we're not going to be having a live show next week

00:08.520 --> 00:09.320
because

00:09.320 --> 00:12.560
Loki's getting married, right Loki? Yes.

00:12.560 --> 00:16.300
So we thought, and we have a lot of chatters who wants to know, who

00:16.300 --> 00:20.240
is Loki getting married to? So we asked her to sit in for a little bit so we could

00:20.240 --> 00:22.200
say hello. So please say hello to Nellie.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.600
Hi everybody. How you doing? I'm doing good. So

00:25.600 --> 00:28.680
you're getting married to Loki next week, correct? Sadly enough, yes.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.720
Why do you say sadly enough?

00:31.720 --> 00:36.520
Sadly for him. First thing they wanted to know, are you into video games at all?

00:36.520 --> 00:41.320
No. No, why not? Because they're boring.

00:41.320 --> 00:45.320
Do you think they take away from

00:45.320 --> 00:50.400
cuddle time? No, I have a pretty rigid regime in the house

00:50.400 --> 00:54.400
where he can't play them when I'm there.

00:54.400 --> 00:58.360
I don't understand the fascination.

00:58.360 --> 01:02.120
You don't? No. That's right. I don't even know how to use the buttons.

01:02.120 --> 01:06.200
What are you into? Porn.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.720
As you've told everybody already. I was just teasing though. You don't have to

01:09.720 --> 01:12.120
say that just because I said that. Are you really into porn?

01:12.120 --> 01:15.720
I guess. And what kind of porn do you like? All kinds.

01:15.720 --> 01:22.120
All right, that's cool. Dog porn. So there's not a single like dog porn?

01:22.120 --> 01:25.560
She's just trying to make herself sound freaky because you're marrying her.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.560
How long have you and Matt been together?

01:27.560 --> 01:29.560
It's going to be five years in July.

01:29.560 --> 01:33.560
So what made you choose the 30th for your wedding date of April?

01:33.560 --> 01:35.560
I don't know, random.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.560
Did you just throw a dart at the calendar and that's what you got?

01:37.560 --> 01:41.560
Actually, sort of. I opened the calendar and I pointed my finger and there it was.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.560
How did he propose?

01:43.560 --> 01:45.560
I can't think.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.560
It was that awful.

01:47.560 --> 01:53.560
No, but there was a lack of clothing at that time.

01:53.560 --> 01:58.000
Ew! Oh God, I gotta wash my brain, I gotta wash my brain. No, it wasn't that bad, it was very sweet.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.760
I was Loki's roommate at the time.

01:59.760 --> 02:03.080
Yes you were, I think you were probably like right outside too.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.960
Like with your computer. Doing video games. Masturbating, I don't know.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.640
Oh maybe, I don't know. Let's see.

02:10.640 --> 02:13.840
What else was I gonna ask you? So he's going to E3

02:13.840 --> 02:16.960
like a couple weeks after the wedding. I know, bastard. And does that

02:16.960 --> 02:20.360
piss you off? We've come to an agreement about it.

02:20.360 --> 02:24.000
Okay, what's the agreement? He gets to go to E3? And then he gets me a present.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.040
But what if he brings back a t-shirt?

02:28.040 --> 02:32.360
Then he's gonna be in trouble. No! Anything he'll bring me I will love

02:32.360 --> 02:36.240
because I love him and he basically lets me have whatever I want anytime I want.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.040
So, it's about time I gave something back. What is it that you see in Loki?

02:40.040 --> 02:43.120
Because a lot of our listeners, you know, think he's a dick.

02:43.120 --> 02:48.840
They're fucking dicks. He's hot! I'm just kidding. Everybody loves Loki.

02:48.840 --> 02:52.240
all right they just you know it's just the man except for the Apple fans cuz

02:52.240 --> 02:54.040
that would you do you use computers now

02:54.040 --> 02:57.800
a computer yeah

02:57.800 --> 03:00.880
I know you're not that bigger he likes those stupid

03:00.880 --> 03:04.120
pretty computers oh my god you like apples

03:04.120 --> 03:07.480
they sell pretty so you like apples only cuz they're cute

03:07.480 --> 03:12.240
I don't need to do anything on it I just need to be able to access my email look

03:12.240 --> 03:13.720
a porn of course

03:13.720 --> 03:17.520
not that it yeah the first day I had this laptop

03:17.520 --> 03:21.160
I freaking couldn't even work on it at work because I had to go to a conference room to

03:21.160 --> 03:24.000
remove the porn that she put on the backdrop. I'm funny, shut up.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.360
It was great. It was like this giant vagina

03:28.360 --> 03:31.720
and the girl like didn't even do a good job waxing because you could see the

03:31.720 --> 03:33.520
little hairs growing back. It was so funny.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.700
Now I gotta leisure my brain.

03:36.700 --> 03:40.640
This is why we don't podcast this little bonus segment here.

03:40.640 --> 03:45.120
Well I actually did that during the show. I know you were, the week he got that laptop

03:45.120 --> 03:47.240
you were, the first thing you did was started putting porn on it.

03:47.240 --> 03:50.480
yeah cuz I was asking if you want a gay porn site so you could use I was trying

03:50.480 --> 03:51.480
to send him some time

03:51.480 --> 03:56.080
what kinda work do you do for a living

03:56.080 --> 03:59.360
you don't have to tell us where but you know what kinda work I talk on the phone and yell at

03:59.360 --> 04:02.920
dumbasses all day really ever had any really annoying customers you just gotten a yell at

04:02.920 --> 04:06.680
completely I don't yell at customers I yell at notaries

04:06.680 --> 04:09.920
and every notary is an idiot pretty much okay

04:09.920 --> 04:12.960
I don't know I don't have any funny stories I should have prepared better

04:12.960 --> 04:15.960
that's alright well you came on here last minute you're a good sport did you see the

04:15.960 --> 04:16.640
shirt we got him

04:16.640 --> 04:20.720
last week? Yes, it's funny, he wore it to work. Did he? Okay.

04:20.720 --> 04:24.040
That's good. We just want to make sure you weren't going to be offended by it, but I knew you.

04:24.040 --> 04:27.240
Game over! You know it's totally true.

04:27.240 --> 04:31.560
I know! He's done for!

04:31.560 --> 04:35.840
The chat room is saying, uh, Loki's whipped. Is this true?

04:35.840 --> 04:39.400
No.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.720
Sometimes I wish we were a TV show. Oh!

04:42.720 --> 04:46.040
Plug my Myspace thing, it's got a picture of

04:46.040 --> 04:51.080
how whipped he is, I guess. Does it? Okay, so you're in the top eight on our MySpace, I believe.

04:51.080 --> 04:54.280
Didn't we move you in there? I think we did. So if you go over to MySpace.com

04:54.280 --> 04:57.720
slash Orange Launch Radio, Nellie is in our top eight, I believe. I believe we put her in there.

04:57.720 --> 05:02.600
I think so. So check it out. And they want to know what Loki's shirt in the video you just put

05:02.600 --> 05:09.320
up on OLRPSP.com says. It says, I'm a groom, I'm doomed, or something. What? I'm a groom, I'm doomed,

05:09.320 --> 05:15.640
show me your hooters. Didn't they custom make that shirt for you? Yeah, it was my best man's

05:15.640 --> 05:19.640
fiance that did that and then there's also bumper secret says

05:19.640 --> 05:23.640
I have a large penis I just didn't bring it with me or something like that it's

05:23.640 --> 05:26.520
stuck on the back. Did you see the little buttons Nellie too that we had the little

05:26.520 --> 05:28.920
bachelor party in progress a little light up titties

05:28.920 --> 05:31.960
yeah those are cool those lit up for a really long time the next day they were

05:31.960 --> 05:34.840

05:34.840 --> 05:38.280
yeah I knew I was gay

05:38.280 --> 05:43.480
uh so who planned the wedding you or Loki? Me

05:43.480 --> 05:47.480
Oh my god, I should let him plan a wedding. It'd be like all computer party wedding

05:51.000 --> 05:54.400
You know, I went to a wedding where they had halo at the resale a wedding cake

05:54.400 --> 05:59.760
It was a yeah halo wedding cake and a reception with halo. Can you guess who that was? Oh, wait a friend of yours

06:02.080 --> 06:03.720
He's a friend of the show

06:03.720 --> 06:06.720
Yes. All right. I don't we'll tell you we'll talk more about it later

06:07.360 --> 06:11.560
Um, I don't know if there was there anything else I was gonna ask you is anything else I should ask her about

06:11.560 --> 06:16.480
about? I don't know. What do the listeners want to know? Oh, the listeners already linking

06:16.480 --> 06:18.880
your MySpace page. They're in the chat room. They're good.

06:18.880 --> 06:23.840
Wow. It's really not that interesting. It's just a specific picture. Again, Matt's best

06:23.840 --> 06:29.040
man's fiance made me a little favor too to take with me for my bachelorette party because

06:29.040 --> 06:31.920
I had my party the same day. What did they do at the bachelorette party?

06:31.920 --> 06:38.320
Nothing. They wouldn't let me have a stripper. And then my coworker, Ejreen, who knows my

06:38.320 --> 06:44.080
taste she got me this video is called I walk a mile to see some camel toe and we

06:44.080 --> 06:49.120
watched it and my boss watched it and so now everybody knows I'm weird and I had a

06:49.120 --> 06:58.200
peanut cake. Oh can we put that on our website? What? The video? If you want to. What was I gonna say? Let's see

06:58.200 --> 07:01.520
somebody was saying here uh somebody want to know your boob size but you

07:01.520 --> 07:07.800
don't have to tell them that. Or you make it up. You know they kind of vary if I gain weight it's a D if I lose

07:07.800 --> 07:14.240

07:14.240 --> 07:18.760

you hate video games you know I love you I know all right let's see I'm just

07:26.400 --> 07:30.680
trying to think there's any more here they want us to do a broadcast from the

07:30.680 --> 07:33.400
wedding but I don't think that's gonna happen I'm actually in the wedding I

07:33.400 --> 07:36.840
know Rob's in the way don't I have to don't I have to subject myself to Jewish

07:36.840 --> 07:43.240
traditions for the wedding? Yes, you do, you have to wear a little yarmulke. Shut up, Matt, nobody asks you.

07:43.240 --> 07:47.720
Because you're Jewish, right? Yeah, I'm a Jew. Okay, well that's not a problem. We have listeners that are Jewish.

07:47.720 --> 07:54.600
I have my Jew gold. After we're married, I shall show Matt where I stash it. Like South Park. Oh, you see, you like South Park.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.940
Yeah. Okay, there you go. Oh boy, too hot for podcasts. That's right, you know, I will only

07:58.940 --> 08:02.360
subject myself to such, you know, religious traditions. Well, one, I've never met a

08:02.360 --> 08:05.480
Jewish person I didn't like. Seriously, I've never met a Jewish person I didn't like.

08:05.480 --> 08:09.280
I can show you a few. I know, I'll probably meet some at the wedding, you know.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.320
Ha! Yeah. But, you know,

08:13.320 --> 08:16.480
I'm willing to try new and interesting things. It'll be fun.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.560
Yeah, all kosher.

08:20.560 --> 08:24.520
Alright, we're going to talk about games. So anything you want to say to our

08:24.520 --> 08:28.720
listeners, our hundreds of thousands of listeners? Hi, listeners! Get a life!

08:28.720 --> 08:32.520
Okay, thank you.

08:32.520 --> 08:36.640
That's Nellie everybody, Loki's fiancee, the lucky gal.

08:36.640 --> 08:40.360
Alright, let's shut the door. New listeners in chat tonight, we really appreciate that you guys.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.560
Thank you so much for, you know, tuning in and supporting us.

08:43.560 --> 08:47.320
It must be working, people must really be telling their friends, or maybe it was the,

08:47.320 --> 08:50.920
could have been that story too, that got a little bit of publicity a couple weeks ago.

08:50.920 --> 08:54.560
Wonder if we got anybody through that, I don't know.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.620
Most people, who have their microphone on, most people

08:57.620 --> 09:01.240
actually probably ignored that. I know a lot, there was only one

09:01.240 --> 09:05.000
site that actually mentioned us, well not really mentioned us, they mentioned a site

09:05.000 --> 09:05.240
that

09:05.240 --> 09:08.320
stole the story from another site, that stole the story from another site,

09:08.320 --> 09:12.560
about the story being correct

09:12.560 --> 09:15.720
when the whole Castlevania thing came out. Yeah, that's right, when the

09:15.720 --> 09:19.080
Nintendo Power confirmed the Castlevania thing, like,

09:19.080 --> 09:23.160
nobody said, oh I guess this proves Orange Lawn's radio story is true.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.320
But you know, that's how it works, is that people don't care

09:26.320 --> 09:29.720
where the news originally came from. So why stop caring too?

09:29.720 --> 09:33.640
well we'll see it was you know what we're gonna just make announcements on

09:33.640 --> 09:36.780
the air only so that only our listeners get to hear it from now on and then the

09:36.780 --> 09:38.960
rest of you guys can see it. I've done that before and everyone ignores it.

09:38.960 --> 09:42.800
That's true. Well who cares? Our listeners found out that's the important thing.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.840
Maybe it was just me. I seem to have an entourage of newbies. I don't give a shit about other people.

09:46.840 --> 09:50.480
I seem to have an entourage of newbies. Maybe it was just me. I don't know. Maybe.

09:50.480 --> 09:54.840
Alright let's go around. This is the after-birth portion of the show.

09:54.840 --> 09:58.120
We don't podcast this because you know we talk, maybe we talk a little bit about

09:58.120 --> 10:02.960
games but you know we talk about us and you know what we've been up to and just

10:02.960 --> 10:07.240
a way for our fans to connect with us over the past few years because we used

10:07.240 --> 10:11.560
to do this show for three hours when it was the Balmani show but if you

10:11.560 --> 10:15.240
actually listen back then you know it would be about 30 minutes of Balmani and

10:15.240 --> 10:20.320
then two and a half hours of you know fucking around. It was a train

10:20.320 --> 10:25.080
wreck but it was THE train wreck. It was a train wreck everybody was buying

10:25.080 --> 10:29.080
tickets for, at least all three of you that listen regularly.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.080
How was your week?

10:30.080 --> 10:31.080
How was your day?

10:31.080 --> 10:32.080
Magus!

10:32.080 --> 10:33.080
Ah, my week.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.080
My day.

10:34.080 --> 10:38.620
Well, my week, high point in the week was going down to Dave and Buster's for a very

10:38.620 --> 10:41.340
special birthday.

10:41.340 --> 10:44.220
Not mine this time, though.

10:44.220 --> 10:45.700
And a little bit of pet peeve about that.

10:45.700 --> 10:51.040
They card everyone who goes in, and me, I'm almost 21, almost.

10:51.040 --> 11:01.400
They card me, I can't get in until the special birthday guest comes on in and says, oh, he's

11:01.400 --> 11:02.760
with me.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.600
But the thing about Dave and Busters, Dave and Busters is awesome.

11:05.600 --> 11:11.800
If you haven't been there, it's, Rob put it best one time as Chuck E. Cheese for grownups.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.920
Or I also say it's a Las Vegas hotel without gambling.

11:14.920 --> 11:19.920
Well, pseudo-gambling, you have like the- Gambling for children, the tickets thing.

11:19.920 --> 11:20.920
Yeah, tickets.

11:20.920 --> 11:27.920
You can get all sorts of shit there, and just all the machines they have are just pristine.

11:27.920 --> 11:41.920
Aside from that, I haven't really been doing much lurking game facts a bit, getting some World of Warcraft, trying to get my character up a couple honor ranks.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.920
What level is your character in WoW?

11:43.920 --> 11:50.920
Currently 56, almost 57, Orc Rogue on Maelstrom, that's RP PvP, emphasis on RP.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.920
Wait, Maelstrom, I wonder if that's the same one he plays on.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.920
No, but it's not, it's not PvP, his isn't PvP, I don't think.

11:56.920 --> 11:57.920
He plays on Malfurion.

11:57.920 --> 11:58.920
Malfurion, yeah.

11:58.920 --> 11:59.920
Very close name.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.920
It's PvE, it's one of the newer PvE servers.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.920
He's 60 on PvE, or on Malfurion.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.920
Xtifer is what we keep pointing to, my roommate.

12:06.920 --> 12:10.920
So, but I stopped playing World of Warcraft, I think my highest character was like 25.

12:10.920 --> 12:11.920
I didn't play very much.

12:11.920 --> 12:33.920
It's kinda sad and I'm kinda ashamed of it. I started on Maelstrom on the day Maelstrom was launched, the day RP PvP servers were launched. I started my character, I started Croth, I started that rogue. And it's been about six months since the server came out, and I'm just now getting to sixty.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.920
Wow. Well, you know what? That's okay.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.920
Stop and smell the steelbloom.

12:37.920 --> 12:41.920
I played Final Fantasy XI for two years and never got a character to 75.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.920
In fact, my highest level is 55, which is like nothing. Nothing.

12:44.920 --> 12:48.920
Like, right before I quit, I was finally doing Genkai 1, which is the...

12:48.920 --> 12:49.920
Limit Break 1.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.920
Yeah, break the limit for 50.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.920
And I... just... because I'm a slow player.

12:54.920 --> 12:58.920
But now I'm making better progress the second time around on my new server.

12:58.920 --> 12:59.920
I'm having a good time.

12:59.920 --> 13:04.920
Even though I gave Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 a negative review, I'm still playing it on Xbox 360

13:04.920 --> 13:10.920
because I do like getting to sit my fat ass on the couch and play. I just think a lot of people are really going to be turned off by the whole front end stuff.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.920
And you don't want to feel like you wasted the money on it?

13:12.920 --> 13:17.920
Yeah. I guess that's part of it too. I don't want to feel like my money's wasted.

13:17.920 --> 13:18.920
Alright, anything else?

13:18.920 --> 13:20.920
Uh, no, that's about it. I'm doing much.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.920
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

13:22.920 --> 13:27.920
Um, my week was okay. I've been busy.

13:27.920 --> 13:39.520
Just, I don't know, just kind of getting work stuff done. I have a ton of stuff we've been doing for E3. I've been buying lots of things.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.520
I still don't have my confirmation. I'm getting scared.

13:41.520 --> 13:49.520
I would just email them. Personally, I wouldn't worry about it, because if I got in, why wouldn't you get in? That makes no sense.

13:49.520 --> 13:54.520
So, it's just because at the end, everybody's submitting their stuff last minute.

13:54.520 --> 13:57.520
I know. I hope I get something tomorrow or I'm going to cry.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.920
Just, yeah, be patient.

13:59.920 --> 14:11.400
I've been doing business cards and stuff, website stuff, and just, I don't know, getting

14:11.400 --> 14:12.800
ready for everything.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.760
Finally, I got kind of a surprise.

14:15.760 --> 14:21.560
My coworker, ironically enough, one I don't like too much, but apparently she has her

14:21.560 --> 14:23.000
good streaks now and then.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.600
She's all, so you're on the E3?

14:24.600 --> 14:25.600
I'm like, yeah.

14:25.600 --> 14:34.320
And she's all, well, um, Joel, do you want to, um, we have an extra invitation for the Nintendo party. Do you want to go?

14:34.320 --> 14:37.920
I'm like, hell yeah! Do I want to go? So, um, they were-

14:37.920 --> 14:40.000
Does the chicken have a pecker? Of course I want to go!

14:40.000 --> 14:43.440
Yeah, they were, they were, apparently they're going. I don't know how they got in.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.600
Um, apparently someone she knows, she has good ties with people, so I'm getting in.

14:47.600 --> 14:51.280
Have her pass those ties along to us! Jesus, Dark Soccer and I want to go to that too.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.600
I want to go to Sony too.

14:53.600 --> 14:54.560
Here's the thing, hook me up.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.360
Hook a brother up.

14:55.360 --> 15:00.280
But they had a hell of a time getting me in, and they don't have any extra passes, otherwise

15:00.280 --> 15:02.240
there would be no problem.

15:02.240 --> 15:06.240
But you know, probably next year will be a little different story, so I'm looking forward

15:06.240 --> 15:13.840
to it, because I cannot wait to try it, the revolution and stuff, so yeah, it should be

15:13.840 --> 15:14.840
awesome.

15:14.840 --> 15:21.240
Alright, my day and my week were okay, as I mentioned before, I've kind of talked about

15:21.240 --> 15:24.520
a lot of it already, because of course I went to Dark Sakura's birthday thing yesterday

15:24.520 --> 15:27.320
at Dave and Buster's and watched her drink a little bit.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.860
By the way, just so you guys know what I got her for her birthday, I got her a

15:29.860 --> 15:31.200
Thing of Patron,

15:31.200 --> 15:34.640
the tequila she really likes.

15:34.640 --> 15:37.160
It ain't cheap, let me put it that way.

15:37.160 --> 15:41.880
But it's hers. Let's see, what else did I do?

15:41.880 --> 15:46.000
Besides my car getting broken into, I just kind of sat around on my big butt

15:46.000 --> 15:48.080
and played video games. It was kind of fun.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.400
And went and saw Silent Hill. So yeah, I pretty much talked about my week already in

15:51.400 --> 15:52.960
different parts of the podcast.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.160
I don't live that exciting of a life, I'm sorry to say.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.800
But I'm looking forward to E3 coming up very soon.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.320
What are we, like two weeks away, three weeks away?

15:59.320 --> 16:01.440
I remember we have this coming work week, another week, and

16:01.440 --> 16:02.680
then E3 week.

16:02.680 --> 16:03.360
Scary stuff.

16:03.360 --> 16:06.120
And we just booked our hotel finally, too.

16:06.120 --> 16:09.640
So we're going to be not that far from the E3 outpost,

16:09.640 --> 16:11.240
because we're going to be doing stuff with our buddies

16:11.240 --> 16:13.400
over there at allgames.com, which should be fun.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.160
And it is open to the public all but Wednesday night.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.680
I think all the other days it's open to the public.

16:17.680 --> 16:20.120
So you can come down to the E3 outpost, and they're going to

16:20.120 --> 16:24.680
be doing games and you know all that good stuff it's basically it's kind of

16:24.680 --> 16:27.960
like a cyber cafe from what I understand but it's consoles and you can rent

16:27.960 --> 16:33.360
consoles they have like HDTVs and Scott Rubin who used to be with G4TV.com and

16:33.360 --> 16:38.200
his buddy Lawrence they do a show there every day over at AllGames.com so

16:38.200 --> 16:41.120
they're gonna be doing that for E3 as well we're gonna be doing something

16:41.120 --> 16:44.520
I don't know with our buddy Bobby who also does a show over there should be

16:44.520 --> 16:51.520
Let's see, should we get in the cage match? Do you guys have anything you want to talk about? Anything random?

16:51.520 --> 16:53.520
I don't have an agenda for tonight. I didn't come up with anything, so...

16:53.520 --> 16:55.520
I've been actually working on that, because...

16:55.520 --> 16:59.520
Okay, I'm trying to... My stupid laptop... Now, granted, I know everyone's like,

16:59.520 --> 17:03.520
Yo dude, I got a Mac! No, listen, I wanted to do stuff with my laptop.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.520
So anyways, the whole problem was, I found out the reason why my laptop was crashing,

17:06.520 --> 17:09.520
is because the RAM I had apparently was bad.

17:09.520 --> 17:14.240
and so I had a a gig stick in here that I bought for a hundred bucks or whatever

17:14.240 --> 17:18.480
and you know I looked at him like you know this already has a gig in it

17:18.480 --> 17:22.000
and upgrading it only to a gig and a half you know four hundred bucks isn't

17:22.000 --> 17:23.120
really a great deal

17:23.120 --> 17:26.400
so I turned around took that money they got from the gig step bought

17:26.400 --> 17:30.560
a a mini disc player for recording

17:30.560 --> 17:34.720
audio interviews and wireless mics to go with that

17:34.720 --> 17:38.480
so that's kinda cool but on top of that I've been trying to get my computer

17:38.480 --> 17:42.080
network my computer home it works fine with this one course I just fucked it up

17:42.080 --> 17:45.500
about a second ago when I said disable the wireless connection because I was

17:45.500 --> 17:48.540
trying to job I was trying to change the network because it wasn't seeing you

17:48.540 --> 17:54.020
because I GG but anyways hopefully now it's working no it's not because Windows

17:54.020 --> 17:59.340
sucks good job same as my cage matches on the internet and you need to download

17:59.340 --> 18:05.260
it well then I guess we should get into tonight's cage match shouldn't we so cue

18:05.260 --> 18:12.020

18:43.580 --> 18:46.500
you guys have heard this before here is a clip of song number one you can vote

18:46.500 --> 18:53.860
for tonight Adam and Andrew with emo kid mood apathetic my life is spiraling

18:53.860 --> 18:57.060
downward I couldn't get enough money to go with the blood red romance and

18:57.060 --> 19:01.180
suffocate me dry concert it sucks cuz they play some my favorite songs like

19:01.180 --> 19:06.080
like stab my heart because I love you and rip apart my skull and of course stabby-rip

19:06.080 --> 19:07.080
stab stab.

19:07.080 --> 19:10.900
And it doesn't help that I couldn't get my hair to that flippy thing either.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.180
Like that guy from that band can do.

19:13.180 --> 19:14.180
Some days now.

19:14.180 --> 19:20.140
I'm an emo kid, nonconforming as can be, you'd be nonconforming too if you looked just like

19:20.140 --> 19:21.140
me.

19:21.140 --> 19:24.860
I have paint on my nails and makeup on my face, I'm almost emo enough to start shaving

19:24.860 --> 19:25.860
my legs.

19:25.860 --> 19:29.260
Cause I feel real deep when I'm dressing in drag, I call it freedom of expression,

19:29.260 --> 19:33.260
Let's just call me a fag, cause our dudes look like chicks, and our chicks look like dykes

19:33.260 --> 19:36.260
Cause emo is one step below transvestite

19:36.260 --> 19:39.260
Stop my breathing and slit my throat

19:39.260 --> 19:44.260
I must be emo, I don't jump around when I go to shows

19:44.260 --> 19:48.260
I must be emo, I'm dark and sensitive with low self-esteem

19:48.260 --> 19:51.260
The way I dress makes every day feel like Halloween

19:51.260 --> 19:55.260
I have no real problems but I like to make believe I stole my sister's mascara

19:55.260 --> 19:58.260
Now I'm grounded for a week, sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies

19:58.260 --> 20:01.700
I can't get through a Hawthorne Heights album without sobbing

20:01.700 --> 20:04.140
Girls keep breaking up with me, it's never any fun

20:04.140 --> 20:07.060
They say they already have a pussy, they don't need another one

20:07.060 --> 20:10.980
Stop my breathing and slit my throat

20:10.980 --> 20:16.180
I must be emo, I don't jump around when I go to shows

20:16.180 --> 20:21.340
I must be emo, dyeing my hair and polish on my toes

20:21.340 --> 20:26.460
I must be emo, I play guitar and write suicide notes

20:26.460 --> 20:34.780
must be emo my life is just a black abyss you know it's so dark and suffocating me grabbing a

20:34.780 --> 20:40.220
hold of me and tightening its grip tighter than a pair of my little sister's jeans which look great

20:40.220 --> 20:48.380
on me by the way when i get to all right that was uh song number one tonight's cage match last

20:48.380 --> 20:53.980
week's winner adam and andrew with emo kid a nice long two minute clip for you guys uh will it win

20:53.980 --> 20:59.940
tonight it's up to you guys in chat but you can't vote until all three songs

20:59.940 --> 21:05.340
have played and the second song tonight is my pick me me me and I picked a song

21:05.340 --> 21:10.740
by a band that I like a little trancey band called Phragma and the song I

21:10.740 --> 21:15.900
picked tonight is called radio waves which I think is appropriate and I just

21:15.900 --> 21:18.580
downloaded some random trance compilation and this is on it and I

21:18.580 --> 21:25.580
I figured you guys needed a good, uh, trancy song, so here it is, Pragma, Radio Wave, song number two, enjoy.

21:48.580 --> 22:17.580
You take me back to the familiar

22:17.580 --> 22:35.260
There's no way back, but I still see you I'm searching through forgotten airspace

22:35.260 --> 22:49.260
through white noise. You reach out to me. You reach out to me.

22:49.260 --> 23:08.260
Radio waves fill the empty mind Radio waves from the lows and highs

23:08.260 --> 23:13.260
Radio waves keep the flame alive

23:14.260 --> 23:16.260
I need love soon

23:16.260 --> 23:20.260
Tryna get home

24:16.260 --> 24:33.260
Brains in my mind

24:33.260 --> 24:45.260
Brains in my mind

24:45.260 --> 24:59.140
Song number two was by Phragma tonight, Radio Waves, let's go around and see what our studio

24:59.140 --> 25:00.140
thought of that.

25:00.140 --> 25:03.940
Remember, our opinions are just that opinions, it's your votes that make the decision.

25:03.940 --> 25:05.820
Andrew, what'd you think?

25:05.820 --> 25:10.820
I like good chopped up type of beat, it doesn't get boring.

25:10.820 --> 25:15.140
Good synth, really meaty bass, I could've used like a little more kick to it in some

25:15.140 --> 25:20.820
higher regions but uh all really good really trancy little tune uh really good for ambi

25:20.820 --> 25:24.980
i'd give it a nine that's a really comprehensive review usually get people in here and just go

25:24.980 --> 25:34.020
sucked three good job uh low-key okay seven see see what i mean look at what that asshole did

25:34.020 --> 25:38.180
uh me i i like it i think the only problem i have is it gets a little quiet in the middle part and

25:38.180 --> 25:41.540
i'm like oh i'm gonna fall asleep and then oh shit i just woke up like i said could use a little more

25:41.540 --> 25:44.340
tick exactly it could use a little more kick in the butt in the middle uh

25:44.340 --> 25:47.220
he's about cowbell more cowbell would have done good in the middle

25:47.220 --> 25:51.460
eva god do you know how old that saying is i mean seriously i think we

25:51.460 --> 25:54.980
i think you know what i would like to happen is that christopher walken like

25:54.980 --> 25:59.380
goes on the today show or and something it says okay as of today that cowbell

25:59.380 --> 26:02.660
shit is retired stop and that's it people would have to

26:02.660 --> 26:05.540
listen this is christopher walking oh yeah that's all right all right uh nine

26:05.540 --> 26:10.340
from me because i like pragma all right loki what'd you pick tonight

26:10.340 --> 26:12.340
I picked a song

26:13.260 --> 26:16.180
A remix of song that we actually won cage match

26:16.180 --> 26:20.240
Yeah, butch by the way has been in the cage match about four times now under different remixes

26:20.540 --> 26:27.100
No, it has not listen. It has not been under in different remixes. It's only been under the cage match once

26:27.620 --> 26:29.620
one time I

26:30.780 --> 26:33.040
This is a remix of pendulum

26:34.060 --> 26:39.380
Hold your color. This is the bipolar mix and it's actually quite different how appropriate

26:39.380 --> 26:46.180
We have a bipolar song and an emo song in tonight's cage match. Gotta love OLR. It's good. Trust me

26:46.180 --> 26:49.620
It's off their single. So it's pretty cool. All right, here it is

26:49.620 --> 26:55.080
You be the judge chat room song number three hold your color the bipolar mix by pendulum enjoyed

27:19.620 --> 27:30.620
I will look into your eyes and so will they

27:30.620 --> 27:41.620
You try to save yourself, but the circle is complete

27:41.620 --> 27:47.620
She hasn't always been so cold

27:47.620 --> 27:52.620
Heroes killed at self-control

27:52.620 --> 27:56.620
And being able to breathe

27:56.620 --> 28:01.620
Thinking luxury

28:01.620 --> 28:04.620
She's soaking through

28:04.620 --> 28:09.620
To cut against the wall

28:09.620 --> 28:15.620
Where they take everything away

28:15.620 --> 28:24.620
Put your colors against the wall

28:24.620 --> 28:28.620
Don't leave us awake

28:28.620 --> 28:36.620
Time is slipping away

28:36.620 --> 28:40.620
No time to claim damages

28:40.620 --> 28:43.620
With me shouting to space

28:54.620 --> 28:57.620
You looked into your eyes

28:57.620 --> 29:00.620
And saw what we were made of

29:05.620 --> 29:08.620
You tried to save yourself

29:08.620 --> 29:11.420
The circle is complete

29:11.420 --> 29:16.620
You didn't need to go to waste

29:16.620 --> 29:22.120
But in a way the change was due

29:22.120 --> 29:26.120
The ship has been destroyed

29:26.120 --> 29:31.120
This is just the water

29:31.120 --> 29:34.120
Soaking through

29:34.120 --> 29:38.880
Hold your colors against the wall

29:38.880 --> 29:44.760
When they take everything away

29:44.760 --> 29:53.760
Hold your colors against the wall

29:53.760 --> 29:57.760
When I don't believe it's your age

29:57.760 --> 30:03.760
Time is slipping away

30:04.760 --> 30:08.760
No time to claim time and trust

30:08.760 --> 30:12.180
Since we're shining through space

30:38.760 --> 31:07.360
Song numero three in tonight's cage match pendulum hold your color

don't hold your votes though what do you think Andrew I liked it kind of had the

31:11.380 --> 31:15.280
kick that Rob's song kind of lacked it was like they couldn't decide on a tempo

31:15.280 --> 31:20.740
went from mellow to upbeat to fucking hyper I like it I'll give it a 9.5 half

31:20.740 --> 31:26.540

33:12.680 --> 33:13.680
I don't like bullshit.

33:13.680 --> 33:14.680
Bullshit is easy.

33:14.680 --> 33:15.680
You just never lie.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.060
And if you have one of every card, all you do is never lie.

33:18.060 --> 33:19.060
Alright, alright, alright.

33:19.060 --> 33:20.060
It's a math thing.

33:20.060 --> 33:22.820
Alright, favorite game?

33:22.820 --> 33:26.700
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Milborne.

33:26.700 --> 33:32.400
It's a French card game and you're like a car and you gotta go a thousand miles and

33:32.400 --> 33:39.460
you have the stop sign or the red light, green light and then you can puncture people's tires.

33:39.460 --> 33:42.700
It's all a card game and I'll tell you what, it's one of my favorite card games I remember

33:42.700 --> 33:44.260
from when I was a kid.

33:44.260 --> 33:46.560
I swear to God I'm not crazy, stop leaving me like that.

33:46.560 --> 33:48.060
Somebody in chat room has got to know what I'm talking about.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.180
Screw that, I'll just play speed.

33:49.180 --> 33:51.220
There was a computer version of it not that long ago.

33:51.220 --> 33:53.220
I need to find that again.

33:53.220 --> 33:56.140
Maybe one of our listeners knows of an abandonware site or something where I can find this because

33:56.140 --> 34:04.060
they had a collection it had Racco and Millborn and there was another one what

34:04.060 --> 34:10.900
was that other really popular one phase phase 12 I think is one of them I think

34:10.900 --> 34:15.300
there's another one though that's really popular it's like a gin rummy thing okay

34:15.300 --> 34:19.380
I'm looking at chat now okay some people know what I'm talking about there see

34:19.380 --> 34:26.380
some people have it there. Okay, well tell us more about Uno on Xbox. Well, I've got

34:26.380 --> 34:34.820
actual screenshots of it. Apparently, Xbox Oxide or whatever, Xbox-ide, whatever. Their

34:34.820 --> 34:41.560
website, they have, not only that, they have pictures of MotoGP 2006 gameplay. Apparently

34:41.560 --> 34:48.700
they were sent some debug ones. But, for our in-studio guests, there's a picture of Uno.

34:48.700 --> 34:50.340
looks cool impressive

34:50.340 --> 34:53.500
I know you actually the play looks like it's a players online

34:53.500 --> 34:58.060
that's cool how can you say that that looks bad I just you're a bad man Loki

34:58.060 --> 35:01.780
when this was come out I

35:01.780 --> 35:05.620
I don't know it doesn't say it's they just have a debug version of it right

35:05.620 --> 35:06.300

35:10.140 --> 35:13.480

35:13.480 --> 35:17.220

35:17.220 --> 35:22.980

35:22.980 --> 35:24.420

35:24.420 --> 35:26.660
So for you Achievement Point whores, have fun.

35:26.660 --> 35:29.500
Ooh, Color of Sakura linked me to a Millborn game. That's

35:29.500 --> 35:32.820
funny. This is not the same one I'm thinking of, but this will work.

35:32.820 --> 35:35.260
You can change the rules, that's kinda neat.

35:35.260 --> 35:38.980
I don't know, I guess I'd play this, you know.

35:38.980 --> 35:42.640
All the horsepower they have in that system, they're using it to play card games.

35:42.640 --> 35:46.480

36:51.180 --> 36:54.340

36:54.340 --> 36:59.260

36:59.260 --> 37:00.380
if you want to check those out

37:00.380 --> 37:03.660
What's that? What's Tekken Dark Resurrection? That's the PSP version of Tekken 5.

37:03.660 --> 37:08.060
Oh, okay. That's right. The arcade expansion thing. Why don't you just call it Tekken PSP?

37:08.060 --> 37:14.420
Okay, here's what you need to do. Go to PlaySide, www.playsyde.com,

37:14.420 --> 37:18.340
and check out the Ridge Racer 7 scans. And the main one I'm talking about

37:18.340 --> 37:23.700
is this picture that they actually have on the little icon for it.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.700
Look at that car and tell me that does not look real.

37:26.700 --> 37:28.300
Because that thing...

37:28.300 --> 37:32.180
I'm sorry, it looks like a real car. I mean, what do you think?

37:32.180 --> 37:35.580
I mean... Ooh, that's sexy. Yeah.

37:35.580 --> 37:39.220
That's like... See, I saw those scans for Ridge Racer 7. It looks pretty sexy.

37:39.220 --> 37:45.820
I mean, this stuff's looking a lot better than Ridge Racer 6. I don't know what the hell they did with the Ridge Racer 6, but...

37:45.820 --> 37:50.900
Ah, yeah. It's gonna be sweet.

37:50.900 --> 37:53.740
I don't know. Alright, you wanna know who won tonight's cage match?

37:53.740 --> 37:57.060
We got the votes all tallied up. I'm done. Ready to go.

37:57.060 --> 38:00.640
I don't give much time anymore to vote you get a vote quick I it was very very

38:00.640 --> 38:05.020
close only one vote determine the winner but in the end there could be only one

38:05.020 --> 38:06.660
and it was

38:06.660 --> 38:10.940
hold your collar

38:10.940 --> 38:14.580
which I goes to show me that you all support goddamn cheating

38:14.580 --> 38:18.740
good job whatever who color soccer link me to another

38:18.740 --> 38:22.100
no born PC game the one I'm thinking I've had

38:22.100 --> 38:26.220
other card games in it it wasn't just no born it was like the official mill born

38:26.220 --> 38:26.780
game

38:26.780 --> 38:30.740
and it had Racco and see this is another shareware one

38:30.740 --> 38:34.020
good a good start but not the same one I'm thinking of it had Racco and

38:34.020 --> 38:38.220
I think phase 10 and there's some other game I just can't think of the name

38:38.220 --> 38:41.820
all right

38:41.820 --> 38:45.820
we're about ready to get into the chat room FUs of the week I'm just waiting to

38:45.820 --> 38:46.540
get a few

38:46.540 --> 38:49.820
so they're open if you want to send in your FUs of the week send those over

38:49.820 --> 38:50.980
private message

38:50.980 --> 38:54.960
meantime what was the chat room talking about earlier Clerks 2 right when's that movie

38:54.960 --> 38:55.620
supposed to come out

38:55.620 --> 39:00.900
I don't remember. It's soon, I know that. I have to admit, I'm not that excited about it.

39:00.900 --> 39:04.580
I love Kevin Smith movies, don't get me wrong, except I didn't really, like Jersey Girl was

39:04.580 --> 39:10.260
kind of whatever, but I understand why that movie was made. But, I don't know, my excitement for

39:10.260 --> 39:16.420
this movie hasn't been that as great as it should be. Is that a sign that I'm turning 30 soon?

39:17.860 --> 39:20.260
I'm starting to wonder. I'm no longer an angsty 20-something.

39:20.260 --> 39:21.460
August 18th.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.500
August 18th.

39:22.500 --> 39:25.540
I'll go see it because, you know what, I've watched

39:25.540 --> 39:30.160
every single Kevin Smith film good or bad and I did watch Jersey girl and I

39:30.160 --> 39:33.600
didn't like Jersey girl but you know what I sat through it and watched it and

39:33.600 --> 39:39.280
I will go see this because I love the Clerks movie I love the Clerks cartoon

39:39.280 --> 39:43.960
more the cartoon than the movie but um I think it could be still funny I'm just

39:43.960 --> 39:48.160
worried they're gonna try to pull it off like you know Jane silent Bob Strike

39:48.160 --> 39:52.160
back not so good I mean it was an okay movie but it just wasn't as good as

39:52.160 --> 39:58.760
as edgy as Clerks. It wasn't, you know, smart. Just kind of dumb humor. But, um, I'm all

39:58.760 --> 40:02.480
for the Clerks animated movie, which is supposed to be coming out after Clerks, too. That's

40:02.480 --> 40:06.200
the next thing he's working on. Clerks, Clerks, Clerks. They need to bring that thing back.

40:06.200 --> 40:12.860
I mean, if anything, god damn it. This is totally off topic here, but, you know, speaking

40:12.860 --> 40:17.500
of, like, we were talking about G4 earlier, and how they don't really have anything related

40:17.500 --> 40:23.620
to video games anymore, I see another network going this way.

40:23.620 --> 40:24.860
And it's really sad.

40:24.860 --> 40:28.900
Cartoon Network is putting reruns of Saved by the Bell on.

40:28.900 --> 40:29.940
No, that's awesome.

40:29.940 --> 40:30.500
You shut up.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.900
That's awesome, because they showed Jesse's song

40:32.900 --> 40:34.980
on Thursday night, which, by the way,

40:34.980 --> 40:38.100
is the episode that is, I'm so excited.

40:38.100 --> 40:39.380
I'm so excited.

40:39.380 --> 40:41.540
All right, all right, it's retro and awesome,

40:41.540 --> 40:42.580
but it's not cartoons.

40:42.580 --> 40:43.540
It's not cartoons.

40:43.540 --> 40:44.540
No, you're right, it's not.

40:44.540 --> 40:45.540
But here's the thing.

40:45.540 --> 40:49.320
of the sh- you know how it usually says Cartoon Network at the very bottom of the screen?

40:49.320 --> 40:53.260
Instead what it said was, um, Crappy 1980s Live Action TV Show Network.

40:53.260 --> 40:54.260
What?

40:54.260 --> 40:55.640
Which I thought was great.

40:55.640 --> 40:59.660
Which is funny because Saved by the Bell, that particular episode was 90 or 91, it wasn't

40:59.660 --> 41:00.660
in the 80s.

41:00.660 --> 41:01.660
Got you.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.660
Serious story.

41:02.660 --> 41:03.660
Got you.

41:03.660 --> 41:04.660
Whatever.

41:04.660 --> 41:07.060
But anyways, if there's anything, they need to put, you know, the Clerks animated series

41:07.060 --> 41:09.620
on Adult Swim, because that would be perfect.

41:09.620 --> 41:10.620
God damn right.

41:10.620 --> 41:14.420
That they need to bring back Invaders M and put it on Adult Swim as well.

41:14.420 --> 41:19.700
like all these 15 minute things and they really need to resurrect a lot of these old shows on

41:19.700 --> 41:24.980
there and i think if you think about it it worked for family guy it worked for futurama what the

41:24.980 --> 41:29.700
hell give it a try with the clerks gk 128 says there's a rumor that cartoon is actually trying

41:29.700 --> 41:34.980
to produce new saved by the bell episodes what like saved by the bell the newer class

41:36.100 --> 41:41.220
year three or your that you know get elizabeth berkeley back what the hell she done you know

41:41.220 --> 41:46.380
what? Give it a try. And Lark Voorhees! What the hell happened to her? No love for Lark.

41:46.380 --> 41:53.220
Unless it takes place in the 80s, fuck it. I don't want to modernize Saved by the Bell.

41:53.220 --> 41:59.280
I don't want it. I live through that. I don't want it. I think they should make Saved by

41:59.280 --> 42:06.040
the Bell edgy. What was that one show that was on Fox for a while that had to deal with

42:06.040 --> 42:10.760
the fact faculty you know and stuff I'm where the hell is called now teachers

42:10.760 --> 42:15.200
tiger class says what Cartoon Network needs is to put that old 80s Chuck Norris

42:15.200 --> 42:19.680
cartoon on oh hell yes color of Sakura says they need to bring back freakazoid

42:19.680 --> 42:24.920
which met with yes cheers in the chat room and freakazoid movie live-action

42:24.920 --> 42:30.200
Jim Carrey playing the lead that way the coolest shit ever SSJ 100 Matt says

42:30.200 --> 42:33.240
Adult Swim should stop putting full house and putting fucking clerks on

42:33.240 --> 42:38.000
there they have full house on adults with a rude the fuck is that for real I

42:38.000 --> 42:43.840
don't think so better not be I only heard of just save a bell interesting

42:43.840 --> 42:46.480
but how was it gonna laugh are they really gonna have that for a long time

42:46.480 --> 42:50.540
that seems like one of those things like you know what Eric recently they're

42:50.540 --> 42:55.120
airing like all the big episodes they're not airing everything I don't think I

42:55.120 --> 43:00.400
don't know cuz Jesse's song was just a song had the music video in it too it's

43:00.400 --> 43:04.640
great episode. It's quality television. I t-voted, I swear to God.

43:04.640 --> 43:08.240
If they want to play something at like three in the morning that's like you know

43:08.240 --> 43:13.460
just like the eighties no live-action TV show hour that's fine they can do that

43:13.460 --> 43:16.820
but don't go with G4's doing this.

43:16.820 --> 43:21.040
Haha, Ichiban Crush says in chat, Saved by the Bell is only gonna be on Adult Swim for

43:21.040 --> 43:21.620
two weeks.

43:21.620 --> 43:25.660
Okay well that's cool. Then they can see they're airing all the

43:25.660 --> 43:29.020
memorable episodes and then they can go to a different crappy 80's show. I think

43:29.020 --> 43:29.900
that's cool.

43:29.900 --> 43:33.660
I'm sorry. Okay that's fine then, but the whole thing is

43:33.660 --> 43:37.200
I don't like what they're doing G4. I'm just like

43:37.200 --> 43:41.680
who the hell is directing? I mean seriously someone needs to go, okay um

43:41.680 --> 43:45.160
yeah G4 is supposed to be TV um

43:45.160 --> 43:48.360
about games um please explain how

43:48.360 --> 43:51.480
Fastlane, Star Trek,

43:51.480 --> 43:54.600
any of the Star Treks, Brainiac,

43:54.600 --> 43:58.800
they sidestepped it. They sidestepped it. It's not TV

43:58.800 --> 44:00.440
About games. Yeah, they're not...

44:00.440 --> 44:01.440
It's TV for gamers.

44:01.440 --> 44:05.440
Yeah, and it's not really games, they've kind of admitted it's not really about games anymore.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.740
Not all gamers watch Star Trek, most of us do.

44:07.740 --> 44:11.540
Plus, didn't you see the press release this week that they hired Howard Stern's girlfriend

44:11.540 --> 44:13.120
to be the new host to Filter?

44:13.120 --> 44:14.120
I thought that show failed.

44:14.120 --> 44:15.120
And it's not gonna be...

44:15.120 --> 44:17.940
Well because they're bringing it back and it's not about gaming topics, and they're

44:17.940 --> 44:18.940
gonna be...

44:18.940 --> 44:20.000
Icons is now no longer...

44:20.000 --> 44:22.560
It wasn't about gaming topics when it was a...

44:22.560 --> 44:26.660
Icons is no longer gonna be about gaming topics, it's gonna be about like JJ Abrams, and those,

44:26.660 --> 44:32.320
those like who's the guy that did X-Men Brian Singer and all that stuff and what was the

44:32.320 --> 44:38.640
other thing something about Attack of the Show being retooled so they're adding another

44:38.640 --> 44:45.640
co-host to it yeah who is not even a game type person so well most of them weren't anyway

44:45.640 --> 44:49.320
I feel sorry by the way Dark Knight wants you to know that the Chuck Norris cartoon

44:49.320 --> 44:55.560
show comes on at 5 45 a.m. well that's awesome what channel I guess Cartoon Network Chuck

44:55.560 --> 44:57.560
Norris wants you to get up early to watch the show.

44:57.560 --> 45:00.560
Well, let me put it this way, okay?

45:00.560 --> 45:05.560
I just feel sorry for the G4 TV staff members that are there.

45:05.560 --> 45:08.560
They're still staying there and kind of going through this transition.

45:08.560 --> 45:10.560
I mean, it's kind of lame.

45:10.560 --> 45:12.560
I'm still pissed when they ate up tech TV.

45:12.560 --> 45:14.560
I'm still sore over that.

45:14.560 --> 45:18.560
Well, you know, that's why we like getting to work with Scott Rubin as limited as we do.

45:18.560 --> 45:19.560
Hell yeah.

45:19.560 --> 45:23.560
Because we get to work with someone who jumped ship before it all went downhill.

45:23.560 --> 45:28.920
That's how we know he's a smart man. He got he got off that sink and sink and ship before

45:29.320 --> 45:32.760
It hit rock bottom. I just I don't I

45:33.360 --> 45:38.160
Don't get it all right now. I'm a gamer and I don't get it. Let's get to F use okay

45:38.160 --> 45:40.160

Shauron says,

45:49.960 --> 45:53.520
F you to Girl Scouts for selling amazing cookies at such a high price.

45:53.520 --> 45:56.400
I don't have no big monies to buy no fancy cookies.

45:56.400 --> 46:00.160
F you to my computer for turning off at random moments for no good reason.

46:00.160 --> 46:04.800
F you to myself for only just finishing my huge project for school.

46:04.800 --> 46:11.060
Laser123454321 says F you to Sky.

46:11.060 --> 46:12.060
There's your shirt.

46:12.060 --> 46:13.060
Where's my era?

46:13.060 --> 46:15.800
Good cool fat mix.

46:15.800 --> 46:20.760
I think I remember something from the Rob Roberts show, I have to check out this link.

46:20.760 --> 46:24.840
I'm supposed to send him an MP3 and I haven't.

46:24.840 --> 46:26.840
My bad, laser, I'm sorry.

46:26.840 --> 46:27.840
Boned.

Let's check this out here, I gotta, God, oh, I wanna, control V, come on.

46:36.880 --> 46:40.320
In which Rob gets completely whipped by his fans.

46:40.320 --> 46:45.080
I can't get the link to come up, how sad am I?

47:15.080 --> 47:17.080
I'm gonna send that idea over to Busta T's.

47:17.080 --> 47:19.080
Alt F4, bitch. Alt F4.

47:19.080 --> 47:21.080
Lazer, post it in the chat.

47:21.080 --> 47:23.080
Did You Lose a Sock says,

47:23.080 --> 47:25.080
What was song number two that lost by one vote?

47:25.080 --> 47:27.080
It was the emo kid song.

47:27.080 --> 47:29.080
And then the other one was only two votes fine.

47:29.080 --> 47:31.080
F you to Nintendo of America for not bringing

47:31.080 --> 47:33.080
Mother 3 stateside, but tip of the hat

47:33.080 --> 47:35.080
to Nintendo of Japan for actually making the game.

47:35.080 --> 47:37.080
If you lose a sock, don't lose hope yet.

47:37.080 --> 47:39.080
If it's not announced at E3,

47:39.080 --> 47:41.080

They're trying to help they're in negotiations with Konami to get a replacement act

They must be emo.

51:46.880 --> 51:51.880
ColorOfSakuras says Konami is giving that arcade a supernova machine. That's very nice.

51:51.880 --> 51:59.880
Speaking of which, we forgot to mention that Konami is going to have two supernova machines close to the final at E3.

51:59.880 --> 52:02.880
Which will be fun to play and film.

52:02.880 --> 52:06.880
And record any audio from said machines.

52:06.880 --> 52:08.880
Hmm

52:08.980 --> 52:13.580
We'll see they are we're already on Konami shitless though aren't we no no

52:14.280 --> 52:18.280
Whatever take me whatever they got attention. That's right

52:18.760 --> 52:25.300
It was only what it was only one week before the Nintendo power thing anyway, so when when when yeah, whatever all right?

52:25.480 --> 52:29.160
That's it. We're about ready to close down shop here and

52:29.160 --> 52:33.960
and Rheoma said F you to the people

52:33.960 --> 52:36.880
this is a late one but I think this is interesting F you to the people who

52:36.880 --> 52:40.600
ignored me on my birthday on Wednesday because a gay lesbian silence day

52:40.600 --> 52:44.720
what is gay lesbian silence day?

52:44.720 --> 52:48.040
I am gay and I don't even know about it just like everything else in the gay

52:48.040 --> 52:51.280
circle I'm always the last to know. I think they had this whole high school college

52:51.280 --> 52:54.880
demonstration where people would be silent for a few hours

52:54.880 --> 52:58.940
and I don't know what the hell it was supposed to signify but it was supposed to be some

52:58.940 --> 53:03.580
sort of gay rights thing okay I don't get it either I don't get it that's not

53:03.580 --> 53:08.380
being gay most gay people I know are fucking loud I don't know that's you're

53:08.380 --> 53:18.020
telling me I only can make fun cuz I am gay whatever all right um I think that's

53:18.020 --> 53:20.820
gonna do it I think we're done with tonight's episode of orange launch radio

53:20.820 --> 53:23.900
we're going a long time here we're damn near on four hours now so I think it's

53:23.900 --> 53:26.580
time for us to stop broadcasting so it's time to go around and get everybody's

53:26.580 --> 53:28.900
final thought. Loki, your final thought?

53:28.900 --> 53:32.700
I have lots of work to do this week and um...

53:32.700 --> 53:34.480
I don't know if I'll see you... Oh!

53:34.480 --> 53:37.840
God! There's one story I forgot!

53:37.840 --> 53:39.000
Sorry, real quick.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.460
There's a Halo 2 mash mix contest going on.

53:42.460 --> 53:43.320
What the fuck's that?

53:43.320 --> 53:45.700
Mash mix? Music?

53:45.700 --> 53:47.340
Oh! Okay.

53:47.340 --> 53:51.260
And I forget the website that was about that.

53:51.260 --> 53:54.940
But I thought that was interesting because I might have to enter that, you know, so...

53:54.940 --> 54:07.840
be pretty cool. Basically if you want to check it out, go to h2v2.ggl.com.

54:07.840 --> 54:11.600
Yeah, Ryoma clarified here. They were ignoring people because gays were being ignored or

54:11.600 --> 54:15.600
something like that. When I'm around, I can't be ignored.

54:15.600 --> 54:17.840
Yeah, how hard is it to ignore?

54:17.840 --> 54:20.940
Andrew, your final thought.

54:20.940 --> 54:23.580
I have fury.

54:23.580 --> 54:28.860
My final thought is, um, time for me to go play more Final Fantasy XI.

54:28.860 --> 54:29.860
Addict.

54:29.860 --> 54:30.860
Shut up.

54:30.860 --> 54:31.860
You're not Jamie.

54:31.860 --> 54:32.860
Okay.

54:32.860 --> 54:33.860
Okay.

54:33.860 --> 54:34.860
I'm a wow addict.

54:34.860 --> 54:35.860
I have no room to talk.

54:35.860 --> 54:38.740
Remember kids, no live show next week, but tune into the podcast stream.

54:38.740 --> 54:41.860
When you next hear Loki, he will be a married man.

54:41.860 --> 54:42.860
Sucker.

54:42.860 --> 54:48.620
I will be the only unmarried OLR host.

54:48.620 --> 54:50.380
How sad.

54:50.380 --> 54:53.480
And since, you know, with the laws being the way they are, I won't be getting married for

54:53.480 --> 54:54.480
a while.

54:54.480 --> 54:55.480
Womp womp womp.

54:55.480 --> 54:56.480
Unless I move to Massachusetts.

54:56.480 --> 54:57.480
Oh well.

54:57.480 --> 54:58.480
Who cares?

54:58.480 --> 55:00.480
Oh well, you're not a sucker, right?

55:00.480 --> 55:03.120
Hey, it just gives me the right to be bitter.

55:03.120 --> 55:09.680
So when I'm especially bitter on the show, I can just go, hey, it's because I'm not married.

55:09.680 --> 55:10.900
Have a good one, everybody.

55:10.900 --> 55:11.900

56:07.220 --> 56:13.500
Life's gonna suck when you row up, when you row up, when you row up. Life's gonna suck

56:13.500 --> 56:18.500
when you row up. It sucks pretty bad right now. Hey, if you know the words, sing along

56:18.500 --> 56:23.880
You're going to have to mow the lawn. Do the dishes. Make your bed. You're going to

56:23.880 --> 56:29.160
have to go to school until you are 17. It's going to seem like 3 times as long as that.

56:29.160 --> 56:35.140
You might have to go to war. Shoot a gun. Kill a nun. You might have to go to war when

56:35.140 --> 56:40.460
you get out of school. Eight sure up, kids. It gets a lot worse. You're going to have

56:40.460 --> 56:45.260
to deal with stress. Deal with stress. Deal with stress. You're going to be a giant mess

56:45.260 --> 56:47.260
When you get back from the war

56:47.260 --> 56:50.760
Santa Claus does not exist and there's no Easter Bunny

56:50.760 --> 56:54.260
You'll find out when you grow up that Brikford isn't funny

56:54.260 --> 56:55.760
Bunny Bunny!

56:55.760 --> 56:57.260
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

56:57.260 --> 56:59.260
Life's gonna suck when you grow up

56:59.260 --> 57:01.260
When you grow up, when you grow up

57:01.260 --> 57:02.760
Life's gonna suck when you grow up

57:02.760 --> 57:04.760
It sucks pretty bad right now

57:05.760 --> 57:07.760
You're gonna end up smoking crack

57:07.760 --> 57:09.760
On your back, face the back

57:09.760 --> 57:11.260
You're gonna end up hooked on smack

57:11.260 --> 57:13.260
And then you're gonna die

57:18.620 --> 57:21.280
And then you're gonna die

57:29.820 --> 57:31.820
Time for the kids

57:33.420 --> 57:37.820
Dark soccer is a damn dirty cheater too. That that song was just in like four weeks ago, I think

57:37.820 --> 57:43.940
Oh well. Oh well. No, it was in last week's pre-show, that's why it sounds like it was

57:43.940 --> 57:46.460
just, it was in last week's pre-show, but it wasn't a fortune cookie, but it was a fortune

57:46.460 --> 57:49.860
cookie not that long ago. And the moral of the story is, it pays to cheat. You know what,

57:49.860 --> 57:53.540
that's one of my favorite fortune cookie messages anyway, so I don't care. I'll play that every

57:53.540 --> 58:01.020
week if you kids don't shut up. Just kidding. Love ya. Have a great night everybody, and
