WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Thank you.

02:00.000 --> 02:24.240
Bring on the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.240
Here we are.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.440
It's the part of the show you can only hear on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.840
It's too hot to podcast, people.

02:29.840 --> 02:33.560
I love this comment from SSJ100Matt in our chat room.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.600
Those two should have a Friday night nerd podcast.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.000
I think referring to Spike and Dark Sakura.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.320
Would you like to be a guest on Pump Up the Volume

02:42.320 --> 02:44.080
in the next couple weeks?

02:44.080 --> 02:46.160
It'll take a little bit of effort to be out here,

02:46.160 --> 02:47.480
but I would love to.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.200
Tuesday night, we will have geek chat

02:50.200 --> 02:51.560
in between music requests.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.200
Kill me.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.160
No, I'm kidding.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.640
I love this new wallpaper.

02:54.640 --> 02:55.800
What's the wallpaper you got?

02:55.800 --> 02:58.600
Someone in the chat room put up Taiko no Tatsujin wallpaper

02:58.600 --> 03:02.680
off of 4chan, so it's now my wallpaper on my laptop.

03:02.680 --> 03:06.120
It replaced Silent Hill.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.640
She'd be proud.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.680
So what's the plan for the Silent Hill movie, yo?

03:09.680 --> 03:11.520
I know we've got to go see it, but what?

03:11.520 --> 03:14.440
Yeah, I want to get a big, big group together on Friday,

03:14.440 --> 03:19.040
because I'm having one of our listeners and a good friend

03:19.040 --> 03:24.840
come up from the Bay Area to come to the movie with us.

03:24.840 --> 03:31.720
and just want to get as many people together to just nerd out the movie and it would be cool though

03:31.720 --> 03:34.600
if we all had like those cheese hats and repainted them to look like pyramid head

03:35.800 --> 03:41.960
you nerd that is such a good idea i would totally do that and like carry around like you know a

03:41.960 --> 03:46.840
little three inch spear you know what's what's sad though is that i'm getting invited to a lot

03:46.840 --> 03:51.160
of these things i mean i i'll probably do jamie's because she does have the birthday advantage

03:51.160 --> 03:55.640
so who yeah so I'm but you know I know says it's a lot of people planning on

03:55.640 --> 03:59.320
going to see this like a lot of video game fans I'm very excited for how

03:59.320 --> 04:02.760
I just hope they don't disappoint us with this movie I'm very excited I would

04:02.760 --> 04:06.200
love to do the cosplay though at at a the movie cuz that is

04:06.200 --> 04:09.660
fuckin nerdy I mean we could put out a press release and everything in the

04:09.660 --> 04:12.720
media would be there taping us in our pyramid head hats I'll be great

04:12.720 --> 04:16.240
that would be awesome like a hot we should call a movie theater and try to

04:16.240 --> 04:19.480
sponsor something locally they'll be awesome

04:19.480 --> 04:26.280
Well, I know I'm going to be putting out a massive review on our stuff.orangechallengeradio.com

04:26.280 --> 04:28.920
which has been given some attention by me lately.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.800
Yes, I actually looked at it the other day and you're the only one updating it.

04:32.800 --> 04:37.640
I think that's going to actually see a lot of updating during E3.

04:37.640 --> 04:45.760
My personal plan is to go to the business center at E3 and do intermittent stuff updates.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.280
And we're still trying to figure out how we're going to do podcasts.

04:48.280 --> 04:52.280
Unfortunately, we're in a weird situation where our hotels are going to be very far apart.

04:52.280 --> 04:56.280
So, I'm just hoping that we can somehow do the podcast still in some way.

04:56.280 --> 05:01.280
If, you know, I've got shuttle from my hotel to E3 if someone gave me a ride back to my hotel.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.280
We might be able to make that work.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.280
It's gravy. Except, now this is what my hard thing is going to be.

05:06.280 --> 05:10.280
It's because I'm pulled between doing DDR Freak stuff and doing Orange Lounge stuff.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.280
So, you know.

05:11.280 --> 05:14.280
I'm trying to fit everything in.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.280
So, if worse comes to worse.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.280
I'm probably going to skip Roscoe's this year.

05:17.280 --> 05:20.640
You might have to contribute individual reports or something. We'll figure something out.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.560
I'm probably gonna skip Roscoe's this year though.

05:22.560 --> 05:26.240
Roscoe's is overrated now. It's so 2004.

05:26.240 --> 05:30.240
I can't eat Roscoe's anymore just because I get sick off of most food now, so.

05:30.240 --> 05:30.960
Yeah.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.400
You know, unless I cook it myself.

05:33.840 --> 05:38.560
All right. Anyway, let's do a little bit real quickly of how was your week, how was your day?

05:38.560 --> 05:43.200
Just real fast and then we'll move on here to the cage match. DarkStalker, how was your week?

05:43.200 --> 05:48.640
I had the bird flu and then I worked and it was my spring break when I had the bird flu

05:48.640 --> 05:50.640
So thankfully I didn't have to go to class on Tuesday

05:51.800 --> 05:56.320
Which was my flash class anyway, and I would have been dead. I've been like flash blah

05:56.320 --> 06:01.560
I love my flash class, but God I did though. It was pretty funny cuz a week before

06:02.240 --> 06:07.000
The teacher had us review our our animated ads, you know

06:07.000 --> 06:12.860
I did the Silent Hill one and she spent like maybe two minutes on everybody else like 15 minutes on mine

06:13.840 --> 06:16.800
What was she saying about it? She loved it. She said that it was fantastic

06:17.480 --> 06:21.120
And I got I got a good scrawn except to turn it in a little bit late

06:21.120 --> 06:26.620
But you know she just and then we actually had a discussion because I have that rain effect

06:26.620 --> 06:30.840
But it trails off and so we decided that the way to get it to complete to

06:30.840 --> 06:35.340
continuously scroll the rain effect is to set up new frames of animation on the

06:35.340 --> 06:40.380
main story reel and have it replay them at different times so I'm trying to

06:40.380 --> 06:44.220
figure out how to do that because I'm I'm still a flash newbie but at least

06:44.220 --> 06:48.580
I've got the design part down well congratulations thank you I'm actually

06:48.580 --> 06:54.780
working on a flash design for us I'm working on doing a special orange

06:54.780 --> 06:59.660
lounge photo gallery but I need to take a picture of your desk oh god why I'm

06:59.660 --> 07:04.520
going to use your computer as the frame for the placeholder for the images to

07:04.520 --> 07:09.240
pop up in. Oh okay. But it's it's gonna be it's gonna be a month or so out it's

07:09.240 --> 07:12.980
gonna it's gonna require so with all the crap all around and yes the crap is I'm

07:12.980 --> 07:17.060
actually gonna add in more crap in Illustrator. Oh goody. So it's gonna be

07:17.060 --> 07:20.420
the uber crappy desk and I'm gonna expand your desk by like another you

07:20.420 --> 07:25.100
know two feet. Yeah I wish I could really have that that would be nice. So I'm

07:25.100 --> 07:37.380
gonna be working on it. Alright. Um. Loki, how was your week? How was your day? Well,

07:37.380 --> 07:43.340
my week was pretty good. I had my bachelor party last night, and I got very sick drunk,

07:43.340 --> 07:49.540
and I basically, we went to Golf Land, um, drunk and went and played some mini golf,

07:49.540 --> 07:55.100
And I apparently played some Mario Kart GP, which I am right now recording to my computer

07:55.100 --> 07:59.060
so we can put it on the website, because I'm doing a lot of yelling.

07:59.060 --> 08:04.380
And the face that I have on the thing is hilarious.

08:04.380 --> 08:06.820
You have to see this.

08:06.820 --> 08:14.260
But yeah, I look really wasted there, and I don't remember actually playing Mario Kart.

08:14.260 --> 08:17.460
I wish I could tell you if it was good or not, but I don't remember.

08:17.460 --> 08:20.700
I know I'm not getting married anytime soon, but I kind of want to have a bachelor party

08:20.700 --> 08:23.740
just so I can get drunk and be the center of attention for a night.

08:23.740 --> 08:26.180
I'll go, and I'll buy you drinks.

08:26.180 --> 08:27.460
Yay!

08:27.460 --> 08:32.660
Maybe I can have an anti-bachelor party, I don't know.

08:32.660 --> 08:36.420
I was punching the screen, that's just- Yes you were, it was great.

08:36.420 --> 08:39.620
Right, check out that video soon, it'll be up on OrangeLodgeRadio.com.

08:39.620 --> 08:43.420
Spike, how was your week, how was your day?

08:43.420 --> 08:48.580
I threw a party Friday night, which was basically a big excuse to play Power Stone with people

08:48.580 --> 08:50.220
I don't really know.

08:50.220 --> 08:52.540
And I played Karaoke Revolution several times.

08:52.540 --> 08:54.020
Didn't we sing I Got You Babe?

08:54.020 --> 08:55.520
Yes, we did!

08:55.520 --> 08:58.180
I do a mean share, I just wanted to point out.

08:58.180 --> 08:59.860
I love doing a mean share.

08:59.860 --> 09:00.860
It was awesome.

09:00.860 --> 09:01.860
Good times.

09:01.860 --> 09:02.860
Alright.

09:02.860 --> 09:04.860
Is that it?

09:04.860 --> 09:05.860
Um.

09:05.860 --> 09:08.020
You're just a regular party animal.

09:08.020 --> 09:09.020
Oh yeah.

09:09.020 --> 09:10.020
No.

09:10.020 --> 09:13.500
So, yeah, no, I had a very game-centric week.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.660
Threw a party, played games.

09:15.660 --> 09:16.900
Played games and not at a party.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.140
That's the long and the short of it.

09:19.140 --> 09:20.220
All right.

09:20.220 --> 09:21.460
Sounds awesome.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.220
My week of my day was pretty good.

09:23.220 --> 09:27.980
Played a little bit of, oh, fancy 11, and played other games.

09:27.980 --> 09:31.940
And just kind of, I had a overall pretty mellow week.

09:31.940 --> 09:33.900
Easter was today, so I went to my parents'

09:33.900 --> 09:35.560
where we had leftovers because my parents

09:35.560 --> 09:36.940
didn't feel like cooking.

09:36.940 --> 09:38.820
And then, I'm trying to think.

09:38.820 --> 09:41.700
Friday we went to that party so that was you know part of the weekend there

09:41.700 --> 09:44.220
because you don't exactly live around the corner so it's a little bit of a

09:44.220 --> 09:49.340
drive but it's good it was all worth it so but I was the probably the only sober

09:49.340 --> 09:52.700
person there which was kind of interesting so that made me a little sad

09:52.700 --> 09:56.580
tear your share would have been a little better and drunk I think probably I

09:56.580 --> 09:58.900
would've been a lot louder and probably woken up the neighbors but then driving

09:58.900 --> 10:02.020
home wouldn't have been fun see the reason I threw a party this week is

10:02.020 --> 10:06.300
because I my downstairs neighbors were evicted oh that's why I wasn't telling

10:06.300 --> 10:11.020
anyone to shut their mouth oh god that's great oh yeah we should have held held

10:11.020 --> 10:14.500
the party downstairs could have broke in such a good idea

10:14.500 --> 10:19.820
would've been awesome all right uh moving on let's get into the orange

10:19.820 --> 10:23.940
lounge radio cage match sound like a plan sure all right since we have new

10:23.940 --> 10:27.020
people listening for the first time tonight the orange launch radio cage

10:27.020 --> 10:31.260
match is where we play three songs for you guys a clip of last week's winner

10:31.260 --> 10:33.660
and then two new songs for you guys and

10:34.380 --> 10:39.660
You guys vote and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge radios

10:40.020 --> 10:46.760
24-hour day seven a week music and video game program or I should say video game and music program. Hello

10:48.080 --> 10:53.000
So we got song number one tonight. You only get to hear a clip of that because it won last week

10:53.000 --> 10:58.440
It's Loki's pick and I believe it was the X noise diffusion. That was the name of the song. Yes

10:58.440 --> 11:02.440
So here it is a clip of song number one last week's winner you can vote for tonight

11:02.440 --> 11:07.160
Remember you cannot place a vote until all three songs have played and at that time

11:07.160 --> 11:11.840
I'll tell you how you vote, but you have to be in the chat room to do it orange launch radio.com click on chat

11:11.840 --> 11:14.560
Here's a clip of song number one X noise with diffusion

11:41.840 --> 11:43.840
I

12:11.840 --> 12:41.200
Alright, that's song number one you can vote for tonight.

12:41.200 --> 12:45.480
noise with diffusion but it has to beat two other songs two brand new songs

12:45.480 --> 12:49.440
going into tonight's cage match the first one is my pick and I decided to

12:49.440 --> 12:54.320
pick a song by a group called bittersweet which I think is a good name

12:54.320 --> 12:57.800
for a band and the song is called dirty laundry and I have a lot of that on the

12:57.800 --> 13:01.480
floor of my bedroom so I think this is a very appropriate choice and I like this

13:01.480 --> 13:05.440
because it's kind of it's kind of jazzy that's what I like about this so here's

13:05.440 --> 13:10.440
Here's my pick, song number two, Bittersweet with Dirty Laundry, enjoy.

13:35.440 --> 13:46.440
And when he needs an alibi, he can use me all night

13:46.440 --> 13:54.440
Ooh, was it fun to play the same?

13:54.440 --> 14:04.440
Ooh, I think I'd rather misbehave your way

14:04.440 --> 14:18.440
I'm just a bad girl, that's why we get along We'll make excuses for anything on the way

14:18.440 --> 14:28.440
I'll pull the trigger, hit a flash, watch her hurry, step back

14:28.440 --> 14:35.440
Ooh, what's a fun and plain escape

14:35.440 --> 14:43.440
Ooh, wouldn't you rather misbehave

14:43.440 --> 15:12.440
Oh, baby, show me the money, my evil friend

15:12.440 --> 15:19.440
Let's go to Mexico, drink margaritas and

15:19.440 --> 15:24.440
I'll light a candle, walk in love

15:24.440 --> 15:29.440
Come on baby, let's

15:29.440 --> 15:36.440
Ooh, what's a fun and plain to say

15:36.440 --> 15:52.440
Ooh, I think I'd rather misbehave Your way, was it fun and play inside?

15:52.440 --> 15:59.440
Ooh, I think I'd rather misbehave

15:59.440 --> 16:22.440
I'm simply bad

16:29.440 --> 16:37.200
Alright, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.200
Bittersweet with Dirty Laundry.

16:39.200 --> 16:44.200
Let's go around and see if they like that song in the studio or if they want to watch

16:44.200 --> 16:45.200
it.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.200
Dark Sakura.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.440
It was cute and it wasn't trans, it gets a nine.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.440
Loki.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.440
It was okay.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.440
Gets like an eight.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.440
Spikes!

16:53.440 --> 16:57.600
That flashed me back to the Sharon Apple portions of Macross Plus.

16:57.600 --> 17:03.280
big big bonus in my book i definitely go with like a nine for that uh that for me was music

17:03.280 --> 17:10.480

Like that guy from that band can do Some days, you know

18:08.760 --> 18:11.600
face I'm almost emo enough to start shaving my

18:11.600 --> 18:14.000
legs Cuz I feel real deep when I'm dressing in

18:14.000 --> 18:16.080

18:22.520 --> 18:28.840
Stop my breathing and slit my throat I must be emo, I don't jump around when I

18:28.840 --> 18:34.200
go to shows I must be emo, I'm dark and sensitive with

18:34.200 --> 18:37.080
low self esteem The way I dress makes every day feel like

18:37.080 --> 18:39.840
Halloween I have no real problems but I like to make

18:39.840 --> 18:43.120
believe I stole my sister's mascara now I'm grounded for a week

18:43.120 --> 18:47.120
Sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies I can't get through a Hawthorne Heights album

18:47.120 --> 18:51.160
without sobbing. Girls keep breaking up with me. It's never any fun, they say they already

18:51.160 --> 18:57.640
have a pussy. They don't need another one. Stop my breathing and slit my throat. I must

18:57.640 --> 19:04.640
be emo, I don't jump around when I go to shows. I must be emo, dyeing my hair and polish on

19:05.480 --> 19:12.480
my toes. I must be emo, I play guitar and write suicide notes. I must be emo. My life

19:12.480 --> 19:14.480
I must be emo

19:14.480 --> 19:17.480
My life is just a black abyss, you know?

19:17.480 --> 19:20.480
It's so dark, and it's suffocating me

19:20.480 --> 19:23.480
Grabbing a hold of me and tightening its grip

19:23.480 --> 19:25.480
Tighter than a pair of my little sister's jeans

19:25.480 --> 19:28.480
Which look great on me by the way

19:28.480 --> 19:31.480
When I get depressed, I cut my wrist in every direction

19:31.480 --> 19:34.480
Hearing songs about getting dumped give me an erection

19:34.480 --> 19:36.480
I write in a live journal and wear thick rimmed glasses

19:36.480 --> 19:39.480
I tell my friends I bleed black and cry during classes

19:39.480 --> 19:43.760
I'm just a bad, cheap imitation of goth You could even catch her in the rye

19:43.760 --> 19:48.880
And watch me jack off, I wear skin tight clothes While hating my life, if I said I like girls

19:48.880 --> 19:52.680
I'd only be half right, I look like I'm dead And dress like a homo

19:52.680 --> 19:57.680
I must be emo, screw Xbox, I play old school Nintendo

19:57.680 --> 20:06.920

21:32.780 --> 21:39.660

22:55.840 --> 23:00.720
because we don't have much time so somebody needs to talk about something

23:00.720 --> 23:04.680
to take attention away from me for a minute. Everyone needs to look at my last

23:04.680 --> 23:10.040
deviantart picture because I'm you know my whole inner artist. What's up with

23:10.040 --> 23:16.280
deviantart? Isn't that kind of an emo site? No it's just where people go to be

23:16.280 --> 23:25.720
artistic artistic in this context is that another word for emo yes but not

23:25.720 --> 23:36.200
really heart dear deviant art my soul is black it is as black as the bottom of a

23:36.200 --> 23:42.400
kettle and because of the darkness within me I feel the need to draw nothing

23:42.400 --> 23:49.780
but pretty light colored flowers it was sunshine and rainbows to express my

23:49.780 --> 23:57.040
desire to have love in my life because otherwise it's a pit of loneliness I

23:57.040 --> 24:01.920

24:01.920 --> 24:06.280

24:06.280 --> 24:12.240
okay yeah so like let's just go back and just have Viva hate and then kill him

24:12.240 --> 24:19.960

24:19.960 --> 24:27.000

24:43.240 --> 24:49.720
seen them like four times, I just, this new stuff doesn't work for me. The, um, oh she,

24:49.720 --> 24:54.600
the Babyland last night though, I cannot rave enough about how awesome they were. Okay,

24:54.600 --> 24:59.640
this is how the night went, to start off. Iguana Girl and I go and get sushi, which

24:59.640 --> 25:05.180
you know, me and her own sushi, we fell right into a sushi coma, and it was beer. Fuck I

25:05.180 --> 25:13.180
I love sushi. I have to take you to this place. It's really, really yummy. It's called Sugata in Berkeley. Really good.

25:13.180 --> 25:21.180
You know, when I was out in Chesapeake, Virginia weeks and weeks ago, that trip I was on for a couple weeks, I had really freaking good sushi when I was there.

25:21.180 --> 25:27.180
And who would have thought you could get good sushi in Chesapeake? But it was actually really good. I was surprised.

25:27.180 --> 25:32.180
Well, this place that I went to was really expensive, but they were very good. And I got a free Japanese lesson.

25:32.180 --> 25:35.480
He asked me something that I didn't quite understand. I was like,

25:35.480 --> 25:38.680
uh, chotto. He's like, chotto!

25:38.680 --> 25:42.180
He was just so happy that I used it right.

25:42.180 --> 25:46.880
So I said, next time I come in, I'm gonna order like this, corretto, corretto, corretto.

25:46.880 --> 25:51.680
Ah, are! And he laughed at that. That's pretty funny. It was a bad joke, but hey.

25:51.680 --> 25:55.080
Yeah, I guess you have to speak Japanese to get it, because I thought it was funny.

25:55.080 --> 25:58.880
Isn't that cute? She sounds like a cartoon. This, and this, and this, and oh, that.

25:58.880 --> 26:09.060
okay anyway so we went on to the venue and the first band sucked so we went and

26:09.060 --> 26:12.260
got beer at the brewery across the street and then we went back and the

26:12.260 --> 26:16.220
Mormons were on and they sucked so we went got more beer we missed Ninja

26:16.220 --> 26:22.700
Academy go back to listen to 8-bit and then Babyland freaking owns my soul so

26:22.700 --> 26:25.500

26:37.620 --> 26:50.100
the wave of the future is emo you silly little emo kids you all right if you

26:50.100 --> 26:54.900
would like to send in an F you of the week now's a good time to do so cuz

26:54.900 --> 27:00.020
going to read Chatroom FUs and then we're going to call it a show. Meanwhile, comments

27:00.020 --> 27:05.540
from Chatroom, let's see, there was somebody had said something about, oh, Jeremy Todd

27:05.540 --> 27:10.860
1 was asking, Sky, what do you think the revolution's other secret is? I think we've kind of talked

27:10.860 --> 27:15.140
about this a little bit on the show before. It makes nachos. Yes, actually it will do

27:15.140 --> 27:22.580
your dishes. File your taxes. Yes, and reminder, boys and girls who aren't dependents on somebody

27:22.580 --> 27:28.040
else's. Taxes due tomorrow. Guess who hasn't done hers? In the US, yeah. Because if you're

27:28.040 --> 27:31.160
in another country, you don't have to do taxes tomorrow, but the rest of us do. I did my

27:31.160 --> 27:36.180
taxes back in February like a good boy, so I'm already done. Me too. Na na na na na.

27:36.180 --> 27:41.520
I've already spent my return. Me too. Where do you think my iBook came from? Or as I call

27:41.520 --> 27:47.640
it, actually my, it's the iBook. Because I named it after Bjork, so it's an iBook. How

27:47.640 --> 27:50.760
cute. Will it wear a swan? I want it to.

27:50.760 --> 27:54.240
Maybe, you know what, instead of me cosplaying

27:54.240 --> 27:57.360
at um, Fonami, I think my

27:57.360 --> 28:02.240
iBook should cosplay and it can cosplay as Bjork. I could cosplay as Bjork.

28:02.240 --> 28:06.480
That might be fun. What? No, you have to cosplay with me. I'm not doing no doe.

28:06.480 --> 28:09.560
I think you have to. I have a headband you could borrow.

28:09.560 --> 28:12.860
I know you do. I just picked up my Sand Village because I'm cosplaying Tamari.

28:12.860 --> 28:16.600
It's too big for my head.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.720
And this whole time I thought you had a huge head. Shut up.

28:19.720 --> 28:23.000

31:35.240 --> 31:38.360
So who took their place is what I want to know.

31:38.360 --> 31:42.760
Yeah, but Kenshia is the cool place to hang out. It's like the indie place.

31:42.760 --> 31:46.080
Yeah, but, you know. And Rockstar doesn't have a booth this year either, I heard.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.840
Well, 2K has a booth and I might as well be Rockstar.

31:48.840 --> 31:53.720

31:53.720 --> 31:54.800

39:57.760 --> 40:00.800
I will send a flood to wipe out all the bad things.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.640
I will save two of everything, but everything else goes.

40:03.640 --> 40:05.580
And there will be lots of umbrellas.

40:05.580 --> 40:09.620
You, Noah, stop what you're doing and build me an ark.

40:09.620 --> 40:13.220
And Noah, who is Sean Connery, who is...

40:13.220 --> 40:16.300
I'm working on a speedboat at the moment.

40:16.300 --> 40:22.900
Speedboat's much faster. It'll shoo across the water a lot faster.

40:22.900 --> 40:25.900
It'd be great photos for the Bible.

40:25.900 --> 40:37.020
No, I appreciate your sense of publicity but I want an ark with a big room for poo, it's

40:37.020 --> 40:38.020
going to be important.

40:38.020 --> 40:43.740
Speed boat, let's go for a speed boat and we can get all the animals with long ears

40:43.740 --> 40:47.740
they can sit along the side of their ears and blow them out.

40:47.740 --> 40:49.980
Because I like that.

40:49.980 --> 40:54.340
No, you build me an ark, put a big motor in an ark if you want compromise.

40:54.340 --> 40:58.840
Alright. So he started to build himself an arc, started sawing up timber.

40:58.840 --> 41:02.840
That's not actually how you start sawing, is it?

41:02.840 --> 41:04.840
You start sawing by going...

41:06.840 --> 41:08.840
That first bit where you...

41:16.340 --> 41:17.840
Then you're into the middle bit of...

41:17.840 --> 41:22.520
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, where you feel like your dad.

41:22.520 --> 41:27.960
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, when your dad used to say,

41:27.960 --> 41:31.240
I'm off out to the garage to soar a plank of wood in her.

41:31.240 --> 41:35.360
Ooh, ooh, ooh, kiddo.

41:35.360 --> 41:36.040
There we go.

41:38.760 --> 41:41.240
No reason for it.

41:41.240 --> 41:43.560
Let's see if Dr. Banosky is still on television.

41:43.560 --> 41:47.040
Be a scent of man.

41:47.040 --> 41:54.480
Sundays with my dad that was so yes, so the middle bit of song whoo and then the end goes back into

41:57.320 --> 42:00.600
After a while Noah realized he was actually punching a baboon

42:00.600 --> 42:28.400
Alright kids, that's it, end of line.
