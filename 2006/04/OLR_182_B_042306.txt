Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Alright, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. This is April 23rd, 2006, our show for tonight, episode number 182.
Kid Whatever from In the Groove is gonna be here in just a little bit
but first we got some more news to get to and Loki's gonna start us off with
Nintendo Revolution
yes go revolution anyways
um one of the games that's some
form of its coming to the revolution at least that's the room we're recording the
Famitsu magazine
would be Knights yes Sega's Knights is gonna be making an appearance on the
revolution
It'd definitely be interesting to play that with the Revolution controller.
Don't know if it's going to be a new game.
Don't know if it's going to be a port.
Do know it's going to be coming.
Squee.
A lot of fans very excited about that.
I think they should make a new game.
I think it'd be cool because it's flying around stuff and that'd really work with the remote.
Or controller.
We want to keep calling it a remote because it looks like a remote but it's a damn controller.
Alright.
Also, a very popular series coming back, officially announced this week on the Xbox 360, Phantasy
Star Universe is going to be coming out.
We all knew it was coming, but SEGA has now officially announced it.
There's going to be an epic story, a single player adventure, there's going to be of course
the online mode as well, real-time battles where players choose their own strategies.
Kind of different than most MMOs, Phantasy Star is like an action-based MMO, a little
more so, especially than any other.
entirely quite MMO, it's more like a Guild Wars type MMO, instanced dungeons all the
whole way around.
It's basically Diablo 2 in 3D, but don't tell a Phantasy Star fan that, because they might
resent that.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Yeah, Diablo 2 is a great game, but that's really what I felt when I first played Phantasy
Star Online, I was like, this is Diablo 2 in space 3D.
Like seriously, that's what it felt like to me, I don't know, maybe I'm just weird.
Let's see, what's the release date for this?
I'm trying to see it was somewhere on here on the system do or do we?
Maybe it's not on here, and we just announced it a couple weeks ago right since September in it
We announced it a few weeks ago, and I don't have it in front of me
Otherwise I would tell you that's right. Let me see let me see but let me do a fine for the word September
No, it's not showing up so so much of that so no official release date yet. Although. It's September
Wait hold on there's gonna be a score done by premier orchestras and vocals from Poland, Hollywood, New York
New York online gameplay six player squads this time in multi-player so that should be
fun and 40 hours of offline gameplay they're saying endless and endless hours online and
hopefully expandable quests and all that good stuff so you're wrong oh what what did I do
October 25th oh my bad octo oh and let me do let me do a search it's for october nope
that didn't come up either so they didn't they didn't announce the official release
date but that's on playstation 2 that's the only thing that they had announced on uh currently
But I'd imagine it's coming out at the same time.
But it's coming out on Xbox 360 which is a little bit of a
oh hey cool you know it's coming out there too.
So a lot of folks would be picking it out there. Hopefully not as tricky to get
signed up and play as it is with Final Fantasy XI.
I remember I remember Phantasy Star was kind of
easy on the original Xbox to sign up and play so I don't see why the
Phantasy Star universe wouldn't be any different.
Alright, moving on, I also have a story here.
This ran on Kotaku, apparently there is a lot of buzz around the internet this week
about a new Kid Icarus game that's supposed to be happening, because there's this artwork
circulating around on the internet, and they're going OMG, finally, Kid Icarus on the revolution,
is it finally going to happen, and I guess it was actually published on a Korean game
site that said that this was supposed to be happening, well guess what guys, it actually
We LIE to you!
Somebody got it from a DeviantArt website.
Some guy made this on DeviantArt, and Kotaku actually links the dude's DeviantArt page,
and there it is. There's the concept art for Kid Icarus Revolution.
So it's not this guy's fault, it's the Korean website's fault that sort of perpetuated the rumor.
There are some fools right now who just need to be smacked straight off the face of the internet.
You know what though? Come on, can you blame them? Kid Icarus...
It's a beloved Nintendo franchise for the past, what, 20 years now that still has never really seen anything next-gen.
Didn't they have something on Game Boy or something?
They had a Game Boy release.
That's a minor release, too. It wasn't even a major deal.
So, we're just left hanging here, guys.
Why is it? I don't understand why Nintendo does not want to touch this franchise again.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Maybe they think they can't do it justice. I mean, they have... wait, what about this
flight game that they're doing with Hudson? You think they might have a cameo?
No. It's a little far-fetched, but... It is.
Nah, they're way too far-fetched. Way too far-fetched, okay.
When they're talking about bombing runs and stuff, I don't think you're going to have
Kid Icarus doing bombing runs. No, thanks.
I don't know, the Bow and Arrow had a lot of range when you upgraded it a lot.
Alright, I posted the link there to the DVR&ART page because some folks in chat were asking
for it.
So if you want to join our chat room, if you're listening live on Sunday night, www.orangelaundry.com,
click on chat.
But our chat room is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, you can just pop in there anytime.
And there's some lurkers.
Magus, you lurk in there a little bit, don't you?
You should...
All the time.
Alright, so you can be our...
In fact, I'm in there right now.
You are, even though you're here.
I'm just watching myself do nothing.
That's alright.
You're logging what people say about you in chat.
on what a horrible job you're doing tonight. No, I'm teasing, you're doing great.
And you've told no really bad jokes tonight, which I appreciate,
might I say. Give it time, give it time. We still have half the show to do.
Alright, Loki! Some Xbox Live news.
Yes, lots of fun stuff. But
first off, demos. Tiger Woods finally getting the demo on
Xbox Live, as well as Amp 3, the game we gave away last week.
and so definitely check those out if you haven't yet
of course the speed packs up there for Project Gotham Racing 3 as well as the
more co-op stuff and new
cameo downloads as well and
lots of stuff going to be coming especially E3 week
talking about a demo for FIFA World Cup Soccer 06 and
more stuff like that. MotoGP 06 is supposed to be coming too
which looked really cool. Alright excellent so check your eye
Keep your eyes out on Xbox Live for that and plenty more demos. We're hoping a lot
of good stuff during E3.
It's just me though, or does the marketplace need a facelift pretty bad?
It's starting to get a little... it's just too much there. They need a more like a...
a more user... it's not a user-friendly system to me.
I don't know. But I guess they designed it so it could be upgradable later on, right?
I would imagine so. I think it's just a dashboard upgrade.
Some other things that they're talking about coming to live soon
is custom gamer pics
that you'll be able to make yourself. About time.
Well isn't that going to kill the market for the
ones that they sell? Because wouldn't it be so easy? Yeah, that would I would think.
But maybe you have to pay to put it up or something.
Aha! There's the trick. Okay, that's probably what it is.
You might have the same problem you had with DS and PictoChat.
Random people making obscene images.
possible oh yeah I don't have to filter that that's true
because you just put a big big pair titties right there is your gamer
picture and there's
yeah and so there's no screen they're probably gonna have to a
filter and approve every single custom avatar people putting offensive things
like you know
just do who knows the postage stamps a while back remember that people were
put in like Hitler and things on postage stamps and there's big no no
so I think they may be opening up a huge can of worms are not prepared for
Oh yeah, and I think the Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter demo is on there too.
I think it came out a few weeks ago though.
I think there's an offline one now that's available. I think there was an online one, now there's an offline one.
I think. Don't quote me on that. Just going off whatever. I don't...
I have to admit, I don't follow a whole lot of the news of that series, but...
I kinda just go online and try to be surprised when I see stuff.
Yep, GK128 in chat agrees with me. The new demo's one player.
As opposed to a multiplayer. I don't like those multiplayer demos. I think it's kinda cool, but you should have a demo that you get to pick
whether it's multiplayer or not. It's just my thought.
Alright, well it's been a little while since we've had an interview on the show, right Logie?
A little bit, yeah. Alright, and we haven't really talked enough about music games
tonight, so we should bring on somebody to talk about music games tonight, right Logie?
Hell yeah. Alright, well we have another special guest on tonight's program and
that person is Kid Whatever.
Music game fans recognize the name Kid Whatever from his contributions to the
In the Groove series of games. If you watch the Anime Convention Circuit,
You may have also heard the buzz around his live appearance at SakuraCon last month.
He has a new CD out called Hi, I'm Sorry I'm Late, I Brought Some Records, and he's here
with us tonight to talk about his recent accomplishments.
Kid, whatever.
Are you there?
I'm here.
How's it going?
Hey, pretty good.
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
How are you doing?
I'm tired.
Tired?
What have you been up to?
I'm exhausted.
Nonstop stuff pretty much for the last month or so ever since getting ready for SakuraCon
and playing up there, and then came home, got my album released, and then we shot a
music video last week, which we just finished.
So it's just been non-stop work, work, work.
Awesome.
Can we check out that music video on your website, kidwhatever.com?
You can.
Yep.
Awesome.
Well, first, I've got to go back to the past and kind of set the stage here for those that
may not recognize your name.
You're involved with the dance game In the Groove, right?
That is correct.
How did you get hooked up with the In the Groove project?
Kyle Ward, the main music producer, who I'm sure you guys are familiar with, he and I
go way, way, way back to just being 19, 20 year old DDR brats, and when he got hooked
up in the game, he just asked me if I wanted to take a shot at making a song for it, and
I made While the Record Spins, and they put that on the test machine up in Seattle, and
Everybody loved it, so we just kept going, we just ran with it.
While the record spins isn't really credited to Kid Whatever, though, do you use multiple
music games?
Yeah, I have used a few different names for the game.
If I want to explore a different kind of sound, I'll just throw a different alias on there.
We notice that happens a lot in music games, is that artists tend to use multiple names.
I know Kyle does it, too.
Is that just the reason a certain genre will get a certain name in the game?
It's purposefully to confuse you.
Well, it worked.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Now, you said in there that you and Kyle met through DDR, so you guys were a fan of music
games before In the Groove?
Oh, yeah.
Way back.
Yep.
So, what do you think about all that?
I know this is a touchy subject, but I'm kind of curious what you think about all that controversy
going back and forth.
Does it just stay far away from it?
As far as what the...
Like you know the whole DDR in the groove, you know it kind of polarizes the fan base
and all that stuff, the lawsuit and all that stuff.
I don't really know any details about the lawsuits, I can't really talk about that,
but you know there's room for both games, honestly.
I love them both, they both are good in different ways, so I don't really see the point of,
you know, DDR vs. in the groove.
I think there's room for both games. Love them both. Embrace them.
There you go. Well, obviously people in the community feel the same because In the
Groove 3 was announced not that long ago, right?
You know, I don't know. I'm pretty sure they had announced it at some
arcade thing that they're gonna do In the Groove 3, so
some convention that had happened a while. I was gonna ask what your
involvement was with In the Groove 3. I'm assuming there's gonna be something
coming,
There are a couple of things that I�ve done. I want to do some more, but we haven�t really
had much time to talk about that. Kyle and I have both been very busy with a lot of other
things, so hopefully pretty soon we�ll get a chance to meet up and talk about that stuff.
Everything is still in the very early stages then?
I don�t know as far as my contribution, yeah.
Outside of the In the Groove series, you played Sakura-Con recently and there was 2,000 people
there.
How did you get involved with that?
Brian mentioned that Sakura-Con was going on and they were going to have a dance and
I just decided I wanted to DJ at it and it was just pestering everybody I knew until
I finally got to go up there and meet with them and they said yeah and they let me do
it.
It was awesome.
It was so great.
I've never played for that big of a crowd.
When I do shows here in Portland at home, there's maybe 50, maybe 100 people.
That was just incredible to see 2,000 people dancing to my stuff.
It was great.
Do you plan on doing more of these anime shows in the future?
Is this going to be a thing for you traveling the convention circuit?
I don't know yet.
I'd like to.
This one, being here in the Northwest, I was able to make connections pretty easily.
Outside of that, I don't really know anybody.
So, I don't know, if you're out there, send me an email. Let's talk about it. I'd love to play more of them.
Alright, awesome. Well, let's give them a sample right now of whatever it sounds like.
We're going to play a track. This song was included in In The Groove 1, which is available right now for PlayStation 2,
as well as still some arcades out there that haven't upgraded to In The Groove 2 yet,
but I believe this song carried over into In The Groove 2, and then now this is out on PC as well, right? In The Groove?
Or coming out, or just came out?
I'm not sure. I think it came out.
I think it just recently came out. Well, here it is, one of the tracks from the games.
I think I like that sound by kid whatever here on orange lounge radio
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I think I like how that sounds
All right, that was I Think I Like That Sound by Kid Whatever here on Orange Lounge Radio.
If you like that out, check out his website, www.kidwhatever.com.
And we're actually joined by Kid Whatever right now on the program.
And you've done a lot of promotion through the internet, through websites, and Myspace,
right?
Yeah.
Right on.
I do.
You have a new CD out called Hi, I'm Sorry I'm Late, I Brought Some Records.
First I have to know where the title came from, that's a very unique title.
The title came from, I feel like I should have had an album out a long time ago, and
There's been a couple of plans in the works to put out, like, in-the-groove soundtrack
CDs or CDs with my songs that are in the game, and all of those have fallen through repeatedly.
So I finally decided, you know what, I'm just going to do it myself.
So it's an apology, and I hope everybody will forgive me for not having something out
sooner and we can rock out together.
Now, I was going to ask, do you think that the success of your songs in the In the Groove
game is what enabled you to put together this CD?
I think I probably would have done it anyway, even if it wasn't for the video game.
What types of ways have you been marketing this CD out there?
Mostly just word of mouth.
That's really all I can do at this point.
It's hard.
It's really difficult when there are so many people who are making electronic music and
putting it on the internet that people just kind of have stopped paying attention.
So just word of mouth, message boards, email lists, just telling everybody that I possibly
can, hey, come check on my stuff, and we just made a music video, so hopefully that will
help a little bit too.
What's the music video for?
It's for the song Disco Express.
And how did you come up with the concept for the music video, what did you guys do for
it?
I had me and about four friends over here and we just decided to basically make jackasses
out of ourselves.
That's the way to do it, fun.
Did you guys come up with an idea before going to shoot the video, or were you just like
eh we'll just get a camera and see what happens?
There was definitely an idea and it all kind of came together at the last minute.
I think we spent five days on it total from concept to final edit, so yeah, you should
check it out.
It's on my website, kidwhatever.com.
Awesome.
Well, we are all for supporting independent music, especially those artists that hook
themselves up with video games and connect to the gamer culture, which leads me to this
question we always ask here on Orange Launch Radio at the top of our shows, how is your
gaming week?
So I've got to know, what kind of games have you been playing, video games?
It doesn't have to be music games, just kind of what have you been playing?
much non-stop Tetris BS.
It's the first time since I was like 9 or 10 that Tetris has taken over my life.
So I've been hanging out on the internet a little bit, hanging out down at Backspace,
a little internet cafe here in Portland and kicking everybody's ass.
Are you willing to give out your friend code over on KidWhatever.com?
Oh yeah, I should totally put that up.
All right, right on.
Check that out.
Anything else, any other projects or live shows coming up soon that you want to plug?
Nothing yet.
Just try to plan a couple of things.
Probably going to have a CD launch party here next month in Portland, but it's still too
early to say.
I definitely want to DJ and want to book some more gigs, so just keep watching on my website
and all announced stuff as soon as I got it all sorted out.
Alright, awesome. So keep an eye on Kid Whatever over at www.kidwhatever.com.
Hey, thanks so much for being on the program tonight. We really appreciate it.
No problem. Thanks for having me on, Rob. Alright, best of luck to you with your CD.
Thanks. That was awesome. You know, I'm glad that you could come on. Anyways, the next story we have is
coming from...
I was actually talking about the Major League Gaming finally coming to
the USA Network,
Which is interesting because I've never heard of Major League Gaming, but it should be cool.
Anyways, Wall Street Journal was reporting that they basically have signed a deal to do a series of seven hour-long shows that are going to be airing on Saturday morning starting this fall.
Featuring competitions between gamers ranging from everything from like really serious games from Halo 2 and Super Smash Brothers.
That should be interesting, because I remember they tried something like this with
Arena on G4, and
I don't know, it was an okay show, but I don't know.
Well, you see, the problem with that show is that it was on G4.
Have you watched G4 lately?
You know, actually, no. It was old-school G4, and
you know, it was okay. It was actually one of the, you know, better
shows on the network, probably, but
you know just I did like most things on G4 it kinda went downhill as time went on
I said today I actually you know flipped
to G4 to see if there's anything on I flipped ahead
seven hours in advance I would have had to wait seven hours before I actually
saw any programming that had anything to do with games
that's how bad it was. What was it Star Trek 2.0 all day?
Star Trek Next Generation, Fastlane
Brainiac, Bonsai
you know they should do during E3 forget protesting outside the
Convention Center people should be protesting outside G4's booth
bring back gaming television that's what people should be doing
and I guess following the same patterns MTV
you know if G4's booth, yeah but at least MTV stuff they kinda have
you know some music related stuff it's sort of music related like they'll have
music
artists doing shows and stuff like that. This has nothing to do with anything.
This is Star Trek. I have a word of advice kiddies.
If G4's booth is in the same place it was at last year,
you don't have to have a badge to get there because it's in the lobby
and it's even before the place where you pick up your badge holders.
So you could go and if you wanted to, I don't know, protest, hold up a few signs
where the cameras are, let them know what you think, what's going on. You could be there.
Ravel ravel ravel exactly if you want to cause some rabble just just saying not that I'm encouraging it
I'm just saying if you wanted to exercise your your free speech and protest right and gathering right you could do it
Just saying you'll probably get kicked out of the convention center eventually
But you know a big crowd would get noticed by somebody and basically they were right by the door
I mean they were footsteps from the door, so
Well, it's the risk they take that's right
Just saying just saying
Anyway, moving on to another story here.
The official Nintendo Magazine might be hinting a little bit at when they're going to be actually
putting out the Nintendo Revolution.
On an upcoming issue, the official Nintendo Magazine divulges info on Sega's upcoming
revolution games.
The article also promises a look at Activision's big project, which I assume is probably the
Tony Hawk game and Ubisoft's ground-making revolution title. Another
page seems to hint at the finalized date of the release for the revolution 27th
of October this of course would line up with the whole we're gonna launch before
Thanksgiving comment although that should be more of a duh because of
course your consoles gonna launch before Thanksgiving if you wanted to be
successful so 27th of October sound reasonable sound a little early what do
you think? Sounds about right. We'll see time will tell otherwise this is just
kind of another big question mark. Loki, what else you got? Yes, gotta love when people
cause violence over video games. Actually, in Nagasaki, they basically had two teenage
brothers fighting over a video game console. One of them ended up dead. To enter, one leaves
with the console. Nah. But anyway, seriously enough. Close to midnight, I have apparently
two siblings, one 13 year old and one 15 year old, fought at home about putting away the
video game console. A young brother was punched and kicked repeatedly until he was unconscious
and died later in the hospital.
First World of Warcraft and now video game consoles. When will the tragedy end? Where
was their parents? I'm just waiting for the revolution to come out when you actually will
be able to use the rev-motes to beat them into submission.
There can be only one.
You know, stories about stupid people like that that kill other people over gaming systems
make us really mad, and get us angsty, and that means it's time to bring on the anthem
for the FUs of the week.
DarkSakura no esta aqui tonight, so Loki you gotta start us off tonight.
I dislike Rockstar and their lack of programming ability in Grand Theft Auto, or at least lazy
lazy programming that's in there. I shouldn't have to find out later, six months later,
while enjoying the really wonderful single player game in Gran Torrato, that the multiplayer
does not work correctly. Especially the multiplayer on teams, because you don't want to try it
out. That fucking sucks. And really more attention is to be brought, you know, to this type of
thing, because I mean, we've seen it with San Andreas and how they left in the hot coffee
stuff, and now they're just leaving out parts of code for, you know, the multiplayer. Fucking
release complete games. Stop patching your games, stop releasing stuff that's not finished
and not working. I'm sick and tired of goddamn game publishers out there just dropping the
ball on the stuff saying, hey you know what, who cares, we'll fix it later. My FU of the
week goes to the cunt that broke into my car sometime over the week and that's the third
time now since I've lived in this apartment complex my car's been broken into. The good
news is that this time the alarm scared him off because the first time I was like, okay
cars get broken into the second time I was like okay I'm getting an alarm on
the fucker seriously this time they broke the window and that was it they
didn't even bother to take the radio or anything because the alarm obviously
scared them off so I hope you learned your lesson you stupid thief why do
people feel the need to steal things from out of my car right in front of my
own damn house that's all it's not like I live in that ghetto of an area it's
actually kind of nice over here it's just the problem is the other side of
their freeway is where the ghetto is so I think they all come over here to break
into our cars and seriously I call the apartment complex to kind of complain
like what the hell is security doing and they're just like well it's just part of living in Sacramento
it's like okay I've lived in Sacramento bitch my whole life and I've never had
my car broken into until I lived here so needless to say orange lounge radio
studio for in October because I'll be moving out of this place thank you very
much that's a good thing they haven't broken in here yet try to steal
something like the equipment can you imagine if the orange lounge radio
Real equipment got stolen, will not be something else.
Andrew, you're F.U. of the week.
Alright, this has been holding out for a long time, well maybe a week, maybe a week that's
a long time.
Okay, F.U. to these just masses of people who are just overreacting.
Now if you go to gamefacts.com, you'll notice that C&S kind of changed the logo, changed
the design of the site around to match more with their sister site of GameSpot.
Now we have all sorts of people on the forum, and they have a nice little GameSpot logo
piggybacking on the GameFAQs logo, and for such a minor cosmetic change, people are freaking
out left and right, saying that, uh, basically, this is another reminder that they sold out
to the man.
Well, it was that or half the site go under, but there are just people just freaking out
over this, over what's just a cosmetic change, saying soul a site is gone, and now that the
administrators are offering add-on premium services they say oh my god now
the entire site is going to pick go pay seriously fucking chill out what is
there is gonna be free what is new might be paid okay I have to play devil's
advocate for a minute here just just I'm not I'm Sam personally feel this way
here's devil's advocate because this is mostly a user content site is that why
people are maybe a little miffed at this whole thing with the GameSpot logo because like
I wrote that back I don't want GameSpot's name attached only because they can't read
all of the user submitted stuff is copyrighted by that user GameSpot CNET has to talk to them
and have them sell their FAQ to CNET for them to have it on a premium content system
They gave it, but they still have the copyright over it.
Everything that is free will stay free, so people just need to shut the fuck up.
It's just a cosmetic change, it's nothing more than that.
Seriously.
Chill.
Alright, you can address those cards in letters, too.
What's your name over on the game pack forum?
The 23rd Megas.
There you go.
Are you a mod over there?
What are you trying to...
I applied to be a mod, got rejected, had sort of a user map issue.
Why did they reject you?
I had a user map issue. I was sort of logging in from work and my user map was huge.
I didn't think it was exactly secure.
At least that was the reason they gave me it.
Would it help if we wrote a letter endorsing you?
No.
No, that might hurt you because we're a no-name site?
Why would you want to mod Game Facts, to be honest?
I don't know. I've been there for like five years.
They have pretty big message forums and you know you might make friends there.
Yeah, but their message forums is like...
That's almost like MySpace-ish.
okay okay okay there are parts that are pretty god damn dumb but
you can find little nuggets of intelligence there somewhere you know
what do
I bet people try to find a game on there that's like really old school
like on an Atari 20
like hey let's all go meet on the Keystone capers forums
people do that I have done that I have a secret board
well it's not so secret anymore but I don't want to say on the air but people
have done that
I think I know what it is because you told me before but I told you I'm not telling
anyone else
I'll be nice.
But seriously, you can find some intelligence on there, obviously
not as often on places like Random Insanity, but occasionally on current events
on some of the secret boards you can
find a lot of good content.
But people are just freaking out over nothing, I think.
Alright, there you have it.
Alright, views of the week, boys and girls.
Take them or leave them.
Moving on!
There's another list. I brought a top ten list, now I've got a top one hundred list
coming from a next generation reports this that's next-gen.biz develop
magazine mentioned what the top 100 development studios are and they man
today list them all it starts off with 100 is Hudson 99 magic pockets and all
the way through and let's see it finally we get to the top 10 at some point here
and let me see if I can get to the top 10 real quickly here the top 10 were
number 10 Sony London Studios number 9 travelers tales that's the Lego Star
Wars folks number 8 EA Redwood Shores number 7 polyphony digital number 6
Ubisoft Montreal number 5 Nintendo number 4 maxis number 3 konami core
number 2 pandemic studios about Star Wars Battlefront 2 all that stuff and
and number one EA Canada was named as the number one development studio
what the criteria were I'm not I'm not quite quite sure here let me see if I
can
check that out here on the beginning articles I'm very curious you know how
did they determine
what they was the 100 here
let's see and saying that develop is a definitive
success game studios ranked in terms of their UK sales
interesting all right I'll check that out if you want to that's from develop
magazine lists always sure to cause controversy there comments from our chat
room hits ten hits done says no treasure that list fails point taken all right
moving on Loki what he got for us another list this time it's a good list
it's a list of the games that Capcom is gonna have playable at e3 goody goody
Starting off with Playstation 2, we have Okami, finally, which I think was playable last year
too.
Now I want to say it was shown last year too.
God Hand, which looks pretty cool.
Street Fighter Alpha Anthology, yeah another collection.
On the 360, Lost Planet and Dead Rising, hell yeah Dead Rising is going to be awesome.
PSP Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins and Monster Hunter Freedom, surprisingly missing would
be the Power Zone Collection and the Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded and the Capcom
Puzzle Collection. DS, Mega Man ZX, and Game Boy Advance, Mega Man Battle Network 6, Psybeast
Gregor, and Psybeast Falzar are the two games that they're going to have for that.
Comments from our chatroom over at orangehonestradio.com. I like this nickname, Control-Alt-F'd. It
says Capcom home to the endless Mega Man game sequels and DJ Pooh Eater follows up
with Mega Man triple X.
That's true.
Capcom has done a lot of Mega Man. Where the hell is my Mega Man Legends sequels?
Yeah, seriously. That was a good series. That would be, you know, hey, if you don't want to
continue it on with the, you know,
PS2 or whatever, PSP, just bring it out on the revolution or something. Hell, remake
the first game,
make it bigger. Actually, I've heard rumors that ZX is gonna have a couple ties to the
Legend series.
I'm not sure if those are confirmed or not. No, Mega Man Z
was last year's
DS title. I think it was just another side-scroller game.
Danse Cook in our chat room says, needs more Phoenix Wright.
Yes, actually they are translating the Phoenix Wright
sequels, but for mobile phone.
However, it would not be too hard for people who are into, say, ROM hacking, to take the
translated scripts for the mobile versions and insert them into the Japanese GBA games.
So we'll have to see how that turns out.
Well, that's a lot of game.
I never got into Phoenix, right?
Well...
Phoenix, right?
They're just sold out right now, that's all.
They're making more.
Did I mention that they were making, what was that, the tentative date for the DDR Mario
mix was in May, May 17th?
What, for the new Mario mix?
Well, it's not new, but it's being brought back out because it's been sold out since
October.
Yeah, I think you said May 17th or something.
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know where the hell you got that from, though.
I think Roz and Chad is pissed because I called her Dan's cook.
Well, look, you changed your nickname.
That's what I'm going to credit your comments to, so just be careful.
If you change your nickname to I'm stupid, I'm going to say, hey, I'm stupid in chat,
says this.
Alright, something I ought to try.
Unless you change your nickname to something derogatory about myself or Loki or Darksider,
then I just won't read your damn comments at all, dammit.
So got you there.
Moving on, another story here.
Movie, Movie, Movie Madness tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, of course we talked about Silent
Hill in the first half, and Roger Avery played a big part of the Silent Hill script there.
Guess what?
He's also going to be writing Driver, and not only is he writing it, he's directing
it.
This, of course, Driver, the big Atari franchise, which I remember most of all from Driver 3
because it was so god-awful, and I'm kind of surprised that they're actually making
a movie out of this, but whatever.
Hope the actors have bad AI is
They're like can't figure their way around walls
You know having trouble lots of polygon clipping in the movie shooting through cars. You know, it's gonna be fun
What do you think? Well the the connection of Silent Hill, which was a pretty good gaming movie
I think that's gonna help this or it nothing is gonna save this franchise. I think to be honest. Okay, he's a good
He's a good writer and it should be good. I don't know I have to admit even though I like Silent Hill the dialogue
Kinda lame. Some of it was lame.
Okay, be honest, Driver, very vague story line.
It's car chase movie. Okay, that's basically what they can do. It's just like, you know,
House of the Dead, Zombie movie,
you know, Alone in the Dark, Supernatural movie,
Doom, Sci-Fi movie. I mean,
that's basically what it comes down to. There's no real definitive story line to
anything.
Well neither did Fast and the Furious and it sold. Yeah, they're making more of those
But well, it makes you feel better boys and girls. He also co-wrote Pulp Fiction
Okay, but here's the other thing too about this movie. It's gonna be very similar to the wheel man, which is coming out later. So
Whatever
Go ahead make your movie if it's good great. I'll see it if it's not
Whatever. All right
Loki, we talk a lot about Konami on this show, but usually there's titles that really tend
to slip in under the radar, right?
Exactly.
Like this title coming to Japanese arcades.
Basically part of Japanese biggest English school, Nova, they've basically teamed up
with Konami to bring this English learning game that's going to be coming to arcades.
and titled Study Abroad by Gaming. It's going to be really interesting, basically a bunch
of mini games that are going to be taking you through language exercises and stuff like
that. To be honest, I wouldn't think of learning another language as my preferred arcade game
when I go to an arcade, but then again, I'm not Japanese. I hope I'm not the only one
and just sees the irony in that. A company in the past known for very bad translations
of games, say, I Feel Asleep, is teaching Japanese kids to learn English. How's that
gonna work? The truck have started to move. Are you in joy? I hope they've really put
some polish into it, cause I think Konami's gonna need it in this case. So this is like
brain age for the arcade lame no that's not a bad idea I might be kind of fun
maybe I'm just a bit brainy like they made those little shooter games there's
just a bunch of little silly mini games all put together like point blank I don't
know work with me here another news article
squeamish Square Enix and Taito of course they've been coming together
lately they're also going to be launching a music and film enterprise
What happens is that they came together with Faith Inc. which is a digital content solutions
provider and theyíre going to be coming together to form Brave Inc.
Theyíre going to be investing a total of 80 million yen in the startup, 10% coming
from Squeenix, 30% from Taito and Faith going to contribute the other 60% there.
Brave is going to be working with ringtones, downloadable karaoke tracks, theyíre also
going to work with music and movie studios to produce and fund their own projects and
develop user communities around those movies and recording artists.
The new company will start up operations at the end of the month and all the earnings
will be reported under Faith Inc.
So kind of interesting there that they're going to be working a little more with music
and film, so possible tie-ins to later Squeenix titles, who knows?
Kind of a little blip, but that might turn into something big a little later on.
So I thought we'd mention it.
Loki, another movie piece.
Yes, now Silent Hill came out this week in the theaters, but that's not the only movie
that came out that was Silent Hill.
Silent Hill No Escape has actually been developed for a while now.
It's an all CG movie that's been done by a fan and I actually got to watch a little
bit of this and it's actually pretty good.
Pyramid Head in it. I haven't gotten that far yet.
So I don't know. I'm wavering down.
Better be. But anyways, it's definitely worth checking out. It's free.
If you're interested in checking out, they actually have a torrent for the
DVD image so you can burn it to a DVD and watch it.
And it's a long movie. It's about two hours long.
Some of the animation is a little rough, but it's definitely Silent Hill, so
check it out. noescape.rateofinjury.com
dot com and check it out there. They have a torrent
He's talking about actually... That's not like using the game to make movies right?
Or what do they call it? Red vs. Blue stuff.
This is a total CG movie that's been done. Wow. That's pretty hardcore.
Talk about a lot of time going into it.
But yeah, so definitely worth checking out. I mean
granted it may not be the greatest movie but
it's still worth checking out so yeah.
definitely look into that. You Will Bow to Me wants to know is the dialogue
better in this?
It's actually from what I've seen so far it's been silent.
So it's not just a clever name. It's actually
kind of a silent movie. But I think
I think there is dialogue later on but it is kind of
very creepy-ish. I mean you gotta check it out.
Some would say this woman is part CG but Angelina
Joe Lee has signed on to star as Lara Croft in Tomb Raider 3 and get this
She's gonna have to start training as soon as she pops out her next child, which I believe should be any day now
Right. I don't really follow the whole Brangelina thing, but I know they're in some country
Right now waiting to have their kid because they're trying to get away from the paparazzi right something like that
So right after she has a kid she's gonna go in training to be with Lara Croft one more time and she got to get
rid of that
that baby fat she's gonna get after having the kid and she's gonna get back into those tights and
Sign up for Tomb Raider 3 a little bit surprising is Tomb Raider 2 didn't do
Super good. I mean it did. Okay, they didn't do super good
So a little surprising but it's happening and that is the sound of them jumping on the bandwagon
Let the franchise die, please
I thought that was the sound of 14 and 15 year old boys everywhere
We've been asking for hard are Tomb Raider lots of nudity
Bring it do it. You already know she'll do topless. She'll do topless
She'll do full frontal too. That's right. Yeah. Oh, yeah
Well, she was she do full frontal after she's had the baby though. I don't know
Yeah, and I don't know if you want to see that. It's all right. That's why CG was invented
There is an actual movie out just downright horrible tonight
There's a dark soccer is not here to slap me for saying they have movie technology right now
They can get body double and they can just CG your head on there
And you know what? I've seen a movie like that and I was very disappointed that did that so
Comment from the chat room. I
Forgive forgive me if I had totally butcher your name here. I'm
Sioran says let her die. She already died in one of her games. I
I think more than one game, to be honest.
Yeah, but in the whole game it consisted of flashbacks. At least from what I understand, I never played that piece of crap.
Color of Sakura Sky, since when has a video game movie ever been good?
Silent Hill. Silent Hill? Silent Hill was good, I wouldn't say it was great,
but it was good. If you're gonna ask me when has a video game movie ever been great,
I'll probably say, I'll have to really rack my brain on that one if I can even think of one, but
Silent Hill was good, I just don't know about, you know, great.
Alright. Moving on. Loki.
Yes. As I mentioned earlier, one of the games coming into the revolution is Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
And actually, not only the revolution, but pretty much every other system out there.
One of the things though, if you did happen to pick up the May issue of Game Informer, you actually got to see some pictures of it.
looks pretty cool they've got some of the characters they featured spider-man
wolverine captain america thor doctor strange and ghost rider and silver
surfer and letra are going to be some of the playable characters basically this
game is going to kind of be very similar to the x-men legends franchise except
this time of course spanning a little bit beyond the x-men series so we're
talking dungeon crawler here so yeah basically and it looks pretty cool it's
It's kind of cel-shaded, I don't know.
It should be very similar to the other games, the other games were pretty good.
So worth checking out, might be at E3.
Let's see, one more thing, I don't know if this will be at E3, it seems a little early
for this, but LucasArts is developing a game based around Darth Vader, hmm, that should
be interesting there.
They're going to be, let's see, what's going on here, a Star Wars game, they outline a
new storyline that delve deeper into Darth Vader's history so maybe to
explain a little bit about what happened in that gap there between three and four
no press the a button to shout no god we're stupid all right Lucas arts just
needs to make another Sam a max game that I'll buy from him how about they go
back to some of that old-school PC stuff how about loom to bitch they're working
on a new Indiana Jones game.
Fine.
I'm sorry, because there's a new Indiana Jones movie, right?
Fair enough.
Fair enough.
Indiana Jones the game was pretty cool.

That's how you can do it.
Also, we've got our number back up.
It hasn't been working for the past couple weeks,
but it's working again.
you should be able to get a call 9 1 6 2 2 6 90 67 please keep in mind that is
not
in a toll-free call it is a long distance call for the majority of you
unless
by some reason you happen to live in the same town we do let's go to our first
call
hello you're on orange lounge radio hey
hi was this this is did you lose a sock hello did you lose a sock I did not lose
a sock but I we call it about tonight
about the the sequel to the greatest game ever was released this week
what's that mother three all with that all that mother three was released to
Japan I can't believe that didn't make our list for tonight
thank you for bringing this up hell yes earthbound is terrific game is
it have they said if they're gonna put this out in America not yet out they
still have no
no they haven't all I'm hoping it's Nintendo one in Nintendo's secrets for
e3 that would make me very happy
You guys really haven't talked about it much on the show, and I think a lot of
people don't really
know anything about it, so if I could do a short little spiel about the game and my
experience with it, if that's alright with you. I love the Mother series, go for it.
It shows all yours.
Okay, well, for people that don't know, Mother 3 is obviously the sequel to
Mother 2, which is
better known as Earthbound outside of Japan. That was an RPG
for the Super NES, recently made famous by the
Star, Ness, appearing in both Super Smash Bros.
Mother 3 was in development for about eight years.
It was even canceled once and then revived.
Mother 3 was finally released on like the 20th,
three days ago in Japan on the Game Boy Advance.
I gotta play a small portion of the game, but I really didn't want to spoil
anything
for me because I'm still praying that it's gonna come out outside of
Japan, which
I don't know when if if that's ever gonna happen, but I'm just hoping they'll say something at e3
fans of the original won't be disappointed because
mother 3 and mother 2 earthbound are
Connected to each other as much as two Final Fantasy games so new characters a new world but a lot of familiar stuff. Um
But I'm not surprised about this because Mother 1 was not connected to Mother 2 at all.
Probably the most interesting thing about Mother 3 was the beat rhythm.
The most important thing about Mother 3, and a lot of you beat rhythm game enthusiasts would
like is the battle system it has this weird music combo thing where um it's
the battle system is really music oriented so like each character kind of
has a musical they don't attack with the musical instrument but it makes a
musical instrument sound so um like when like the main character attacks it
sounds like a saxophone um but if you actually attack on the beat of the
battle music you get like a music combo but there's no visuals there's to like
you know make you aware of this it's all audio so you kind of gotta you know tap
along with the music or something I don't know how to explain I only got to
play it for a little bit well I'm gonna have to check it out at some point and I
know some folks in chat room are plugging this website www.starman.net
which I know is a huge earthbound community I want to say we used to have
a bunch of them that used to listen to show a while back we did we the hell
happen to them? I don't even know. We'll see if I support their crappy game if
they're gonna abandon us. No, I'm kidding. I love Earthbound. Nothing's
gonna change that. Actually, Starman.net had a long-standing petition to bring
Mother 3 into the US. Yeah, I'm sure there's petitions out there, right? I
signed that petition a long time ago. I'm a huge member of Starman.net and
that's if anybody wants to know anything about any of the Mother games, just
you know, check it out. Starman.net. Tell those kids at Starman.net to come
back we miss him yeah all right all right well thank you for reminding us
about mother three how I should be slapped in the face for forgetting about
that yes I apologize okay all right have a good one but but I Andrew get away I
didn't mean that literally you can't slap me in the face literally damn let's

yeah of course bye bye let's go over to this call hello you're on orange lounge
radio
hello hello can you hear me
yes I can who is this this is
Nintendo maniac 64 what is on your mind Nintendo maniac 64
okay I've been trying to wanting to tell Loki this one thing it's just driving me
nuts
okay what um it was a while back maybe like three weeks ago he's talking about
about how full auto didn't have deathmatch or something like that?
and this was even longer ago that I told him about rush 1049 how it was another game with
guns and cars and something like that. Well apparently he didn't realize that I was talking
about it had a deathmatch mode.
okay
And if you're looking for like a car shooter with like deathmatch things like you should like look into that except
it doesn't have online but
It does have a four player multiplayer, which is really cool, and you can get it on five systems all four
Current gen ones including Dreamcast and gamecube ps2 and
and xbox with in a midway teachers 3
and you can get on the N64 if you have an older console
for okay retro sake cool
I'll I'll do that tomorrow Loki I'll do it tomorrow
here I am that's your assignment for this week I'll just wait for Twisted Metal
no waiting for you at ps3 right cool Nintendo maniac do you do you have to
prove us wrong on anything else tonight
I'm actually I'm I'm curious about this
Loki, I just said Loki, I meant Sky.
Oh, hooray, what?
You have a 360, correct? Yes. Okay,
is it a core or a premium? I bought a core but I bought the hard drive separate
because I bought it when
they were still going crazy about Xbox 360's and they were so hard to find
that I just allowed myself to get raped financially
and I bought a core and bought the hard drive separately, because the core was all I could get
at Best Buy, they were out of premiums.
Okay, so does this mean you have corded controllers?
Yes, all my controllers are corded.
I have three corded controllers.
And actually...
I said this like earlier today.
Do you know if it would even be possible
to charge a Xbox 360 controller off a PSP?
No, you don't have to charge the corded ones at all and I don't know...
Those are just USB they plug right in and yeah, I know I meant the wireless. Oh the wireless
I don't know you would not be able to because the PSP port it does not put the
You know the right output for USB and besides you'd have to have a some sort of converter cable do that anyway
Well, I mean if you have the converter, why would you want to do that? Anyways, though?
I mean it would be because you can why do people install Linux on things?
Well, here's the thing if you don't have the black just just keep if you're really that, you know
hard-pressed to charge the battery just keep the damn you know battery case it
comes with and put two double-a batteries in there I mean it'll work
just the same and otherwise you can you know find any other USB port in your
house on your computer on your PlayStation 2 or whatever and charge
your batteries away and well the thing is if you're charged on the PSP then you
can basically still have like a wireless controller you can like go all through
your house with you I know what I'm sorry it's for some reason is not
clicking for me I don't understand why you want to do that it's because you
can't because you can I guess wait was it that question to me yes why would you
want to do that well then you can go the 11 feet into the kitchen that your
Xbox 360 or it's not gonna let you go to but then the signals not gonna
reach so what good does it do? It's not going to reach 11 feet. Let me play this
way. Most people don't play 11 feet away from their TV okay that it's just retarded first
off because you're not going to be able to see your TV. Especially if you're playing
Final Fantasy 11. Assuming that you even want to do that. Hey my uncle's couch is like 15
feet away from his TV. Okay well that's retarded anyways it doesn't matter the whole thing
is if you're going to sit that far away anyways do one of two things okay if you're going
to go through the trouble to try to even hook it up to a PSP. The cable you're going to
buy anyways is going to be about the same price as an extension cable for USB. Just
buy a USB extension cable for like $6 or whatever and then put it out the extra 6 feet or whatever.
Those corded cables are long enough anyways. I don't really think you're going to need
to go that far. Granted, I'm sure if you've had other console systems that work with wireless
controllers then you're gonna have to be in the same situation anyways just
either sit closer to the TV or just wait for some time to you know freakin charge
those things or buy a goddamn quick charge kit and do it in like a couple
hours that's the best way to do it 15 feet away how big is the TV um I'm not
sure but it's pretty big you know it's it's it's it's for the porn listen okay
Wait, wait, wait, even if Jamie's TV and Jamie's TV is pretty huge, I would sit 15 feet away
from that thing.
She's got her couches right next to that TV, too.
There's not a lot of space.
Wait, wait, wait.
When I'm sitting in a movie theater, I'm not even probably sitting that much further than
15 feet away, and that's a pretty damn large screen.
If it were anything smaller than that, I would not be sitting 15 feet away.
All right.
Too much anger, Nintendo Maniac.
Good luck with your quest to charge the 360 controller using all sorts of household devices.
I wish you luck, okay?
Good luck with that, it's not going to work though, have a good one!
Uh, Rushtales49.
Alright, yeah, we got him for that, bye.
I love our listeners.
One more, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, who's this?
Can you hear me?
Yes I can.
Can you hear me?
I can.
This is Xander from East Berlin.
Hi, Xander from East Berlin, what's on your mind?
I don't think East Berlin exists anymore, does it?
I don't think so, you really fucked that up, but that's alright, what's on your mind?
Yeah, I don't know if you reported on this earlier or not, but did you hear about what
the Katamari guy said about the rev-mote earlier this week?
We didn't report on it, so why don't you put on your OLR reporter hat and tell us about
it.
Okay, hold on, I gotta search for it here.
It might be under my homework.
It might be under the shotgun shell, seeing as you're, you know, in East Berlin.
He's sad.
Yeah.
Okay, so basically, I don't have the exact quote with me right here, but basically he
said like Nintendo is putting too much focus on the, more or less he said that Nintendo
is putting too much focus on the controller and he just didn't really understand what
what exactly they're trying to do with it and it's kind of criticizing their strategy
with it, you know, in a way.
I'd get the exact quote if I had it in front of me, but I don't.
So basically the Katamari guy called Iwata a big smelly douche, correct?
No.
Not really.
That's how I interpret it.
It's just how Duatik is reporting it.
Oh, okay.
All right.
Well, what do you think?
Is this earth changing news or what, I mean, Katamari was done anyway, so, I mean, and
I don't think any of us expected it to be on the revolution, so, I don't know.
No, but he could have done something new, you know.
Yeah, well.
I think it would have been a good console if he did something new.
He needs to go back to designing his playground equipment and leave the video game world alone.
I want the death traps for children playground equipment, that would be awesome.
The one with the razor blade at the bottom of the slide?
like uh he should somebody should show him saw right before uh he has to uh
do his uh playground design silent field the playground
all right what the fuck what the hell is that no no none of that
during the show no fapping while you're on the line
that's disgusting all right uh anything else you want to share with our listeners
um i reject false icons all right thank you very much appreciate it have a good
one god damn it Jamie's having an influence on America you hear that
reject false icons all right moving on sorry we didn't get to all the calls try

Loki any last minute stories tonight?
Just one.
So what is the next homebrew game coming to the PSP you may ask?
Well Starcraft.
They're working on porting over Starcraft.
What?
And apparently not much has been done so far but it's still early.
Starcraft PSP 1.2 A has been released and well not too much done yet just doing some
of the basic stuff, proof concept crap. But anyways, that's something fun.
That's it? You always have a ton of last minute stories, that's it? It's been slow, I've been
like filtering through stuff I don't want to talk about because it's retarded. Like
I don't like hearing people's opinions on crap like, what I think, rumors that we think
is going to happen on E3, or what we think is going to be coming out, yada yada yada.
obvious shit the revolution will have games I mean yes stuff like that it's
just getting a little bitter at the lack of news weeks before you three it is you
know been really slow but I've been really busy all right before we get to
tonight's last story I have to do an apology so cue the sad music I would
like to give my express apologies my severe condolences and apologies to
Shao Ran, not Sio Ran, because Shao Ran's getting sand in his vagina that I pronounced
the name wrong. So I apologize for pronouncing your name wrong and horribly butchering it
earlier, but this is why I will forever be on amateur internet radio. So I apologize.
I didn't mispronounce, you know, city by calling it bukkake.
Alright.
Moving on, one more story for you guys tonight.
You know you love her, Paris Hilton.
Or if you don't love her, you love to pretend that you're punching her in the face.
Maybe while doing other dirty stuff. That's dirty!
Stop thinking that! That's dirty, Andrew!
That's so dirty!
Ah, Gameloft has teamed up with Paris Hilton Entertainment
Inc. to develop, publish, and distribute
a line of cell phone games based on Paris Hilton.
The bigger question we should be asking
is, why is there a Paris Hilton Entertainment Inc.?
That surprised me.
Paris Hilton has a quote on this,
the story originally coming from Kotaku.
And they ran a quote here.
Quote, I'm excited to collaborate with Gameloft
to bring the Paris Hilton brand and the glamour
of young Hollywood.
Okay, there's nothing glamorous about her.
To the cell phones of all my fans around the world,
my phone has become an all-in-one entertainment device
and mobile...
Sorry, because I can't help but think about that list
that got leaked and all the topless photos
of her on the phone.
Yeah, definitely a one-stop entertainment stuff.
And mobile games are an integral part of that.
Mobile gaming is really hot right now
and I'm excited to be a part of this project.
Well, that's...
She doesn't use the word integral?
Yes, some publicist put that out.
Mobile games are an integral part of that. Yeah, she did not use that word.
Unless there's a game that features a target over her, I ain't playing it.
Integral? That right there is...
That's a grown-up word.
That's over her limit of syllables per word.
Now, of course, that makes our chat room go wild.
Popeanda21, I love the simple life. Did you lose a sock? I'm a slut, the game.
you will bow to me Peter Jackson's one night in Paris
the actual quote is probably like
talkie device play game. DJ poo eater Paris Hilton the whore MMORPG
I'd hit it with a baseball bat. You know what
Paris Hilton mobile phone gaming
these two shitty things deserve each other honestly I'm looking forward to
seeing it on the next Engage
I know there will be an Engage too. You bought an Engage didn't you? Launch title
That's the question we have to ask Paris Hilton.
We need to ask...
Which we won't.
You bought an N-Gage, didn't you?
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Do you think Paris Hilton will be at E3?
And then we can ask her?
Do you think, do you think, do you think?
Maybe.
Oh, oh god.
We need to somehow make that happen.
Because there's a lot I want to ask her, and only a couple of it has to do with video games.
But I know you want to hear it anyway, come on.
I wonder who's going to be at the Nintendo thing.
the Nintendo thing is on Hollywood Boulevard, so that means that they'll try to get Hollywood
types there. Where's it at on Hollywood Boulevard? Hollywood Boulevard is a dirty, dirty street.
Are they having it? Well, last year- Is it Hollywood and Highland? Because that's kind
of nice. Last year, yeah, it was right there. Oh, okay. Where the- Isn't the American Idol
finale around that same time coming up? Um, I don't think so. No, I guess, where are they
at? I think this was at the Paramount, I think. Oh, okay. Never mind. Wherever the hell that
all right forget it um oh DJ poo eater says here's the question I could ask her
what the shit are you doing at e3 you smelly dog-carrying poo face yeah that's
exactly what I'd ask what the shit we might hey eloquent we might ask the same
of Sinbad as well what the shit are you doing at e3 that's a great question I
should have user-submitted questions this is what we'll do listen to the show
Wednesday and we'll tell you what celebrities are at e3 and if we can run
into him Thursday we'll ask questions. Okay, we can guarantee these two. Sinbad, cuz he's
there every year, I don't know why, and Gary Coleman usually is there in some form. Wait,
user submitted questions. We are guaranteed your ass is kicked out of E3. That's why we
won't ask any of them until Friday. Good plan. Alright. That's it, that's the show. Let's
go around and get everybody's final thoughts. Andrew, thank you so much for being here.
