21428	24230	All right, boys and girls, we're back here for the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth.
24270	30273	It's that part of the show that's too hot to podcast, only available when you listen live here on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
31954	32434	Let's see.
33075	34095	What should we get into first?
34115	35876	How about a little bit of how was your week, how was your day?
36176	39018	Chat room, go ahead and send me your FUs.
39078	40179	Send them over private message.
40279	42080	I have neglected them for the past two weeks.
42460	44681	It's high time we got to read some for you guys.
44941	47783	So go ahead and private message me your FUs, and we'll read them tonight.
48643	50685	In the meantime, let's do a little bit of how was your week, how was your day.
50745	51605	Loki, you want to start us off?
52306	53687	Yes, my week.
54587	60091	I finally got my bonus money to which I purchased my laptop.
60972	63213	I got this Gateway, it's an MX7525.
67249	72811	and mobile Athlon 64 bit 4000 plus.
73271	78513	It's got, well, had one gig of RAM in it, now has a gig and a half because that's all that the motherboard will allow.
78533	82974	100 gig hard drive, which is all the motherboard will allow because I think it's a bit older.
83414	93117	Windows Media Center Edition and an ATI Mobility X600 card with 128 megabytes of RAM dedicated and 128 that shares from the main RAM.
96258	97060	Which is awesome.
98121	99544	And it's pretty hot.
100680	101901	I mean, literally pretty hot.
102021	103663	My lap is really warm.
103763	105684	I need to really get one of those cool mats for this.
105864	108347	But it's a pretty slick computer.
108407	110448	It's got some interesting stuff on it.
110609	113111	The only thing I don't like about it, one, it's gateway.
113631	116093	I don't really dig the cow computers too much.
116474	120817	But this was an open box computer, so I got it for $300 less than it was.
121658	123239	And so it wasn't bad.
123780	127343	And also, it's going to be great for video editing.
129025	129405	and DarkSakura.
153743	155705	Spike, thank you for filling in tonight.
155725	156525	Appreciate it.
156585	157266	It was my pleasure.
157286	157926	It's always a good time.
157946	163830	Sorry to take you away from festivities in the living room for a little while to do our crappy little show, but we appreciate your contributions.
164887	169930	And by the way, cosplay at Fanime, per our conversation at IHOP earlier, is going to rock.
170270	171831	I have the best idea ever.
171951	174052	This will be a legendary cosplay, that's all I have to say.
174372	177554	It took everything in my power not to bring it up during the show.
177634	178434	I appreciate that.
178774	181196	I'm going to wow you all with my elite cosplay skills.
182456	182976	How was your week?
183016	183497	How was your day?
184177	190901	My week was really great, except that I hate having to earn money to make my life happen.
191981	194203	I know, that whole, like, earning money things.
195203	196725	Jobs are so overrated.
197465	198446	Seriously.
200267	205571	Oh, man, but, uh, no, my day and my weekend, which I've, you know, spent in your apartment has been awesome.
208152	209272	I'm glad you had a good time.
209612	210893	My apartment's a fun time.
211153	212373	Not as fun as my bedroom, though.
213353	213753	Just kidding.
214193	214493	Jokes!
214773	214973	Hi!
215453	216353	Oh, snap.
217154	218694	So, cosplay.
219314	219554	What?
219934	220774	I don't want to be a duck.
221534	221914	You know what?
221974	223375	Nah, now you just jumped the shark.
223455	224055	Nah, nah, nah.
226575	227295	Anything else, Spike?
228095	229176	No, not really.
229216	235437	I spent my whole week with my free time playing Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy XI, which I was hoping was XII.
236177	237237	And it didn't work out that way.
238206	238807	Oh, I'm sorry.
239247	241050	I'm going to come back to Final Fantasy XI this week.
241090	244394	I took a week break because I needed to give Miklatov some time to catch up to us.
244954	249540	If you really want to play Final Fantasy XI with us, you can always send me a private message on the forums.
249580	251202	Don't send it to me in chat because I'll miss it tonight.
251582	254165	Best way is to send me an email or private message and we'll get you.
254506	257570	If you want to play me on Xbox Live sometime, just know this.
258988	261209	Because some more people have been adding me to Xbox Live lately.
261649	267510	Just because I do a podcast on video games with my friends does not necessarily mean I am very good at gaming.
268550	269750	It means I love gaming.
269790	270511	I like to play games.
270531	271531	That doesn't mean I'm good at them.
271831	273571	So chances are you will kick my ass.
273951	276352	So please don't expect that I will actually be a challenge.
276412	279113	Chances are I will be like playing a 10-year-old.
279333	281393	I was a one hell of a challenge at full auto.
281433	284354	Unfortunately, I sold the game back because I got all my achievement points.
284554	284854	Damn you.
285782	289224	But if I were to borrow it again, I would be one hell of a match.
289945	293567	It was just one of those games, you know, online wasn't that great.
293868	297050	It was laggy and really glitchy at times.
297130	301773	So maybe Full Auto 2 when that comes out.
301853	304435	Because that game fucking, oh, I love that game.
305055	306697	Needs deathmatch.
307077	312741	Needs a deathmatch like Twisted Metal because I think that's the only thing that was missing from that game is Twisted Metal style deathmatch.
314162	314422	All right.
316368	317328	Oh, my week and my day.
317769	321311	I don't really have a whole lot to say outside of the gaming stuff.
322692	325834	The casino was fun, I guess, this weekend, even though I lost money.
325894	327855	It was good to just kind of go with friends and hang out.
328215	329676	Watched some movies Friday night.
330256	332898	Watched Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which I hadn't seen yet.
334019	334879	That movie was funny.
335580	337321	You just made a wincing noise over there, Loki.
337341	337781	You didn't like it?
337821	338822	It was okay.
338862	339742	I thought it was funny.
339863	340623	It was a fun movie.
340683	341143	Do you watch E?
365956	366617	Thanks for watching!
390633	392474	The brother was pretty good looking.
392574	393015	Her brother.
393895	395676	But yeah, her ex, Billy Bob.
395836	396757	Yeah, no, thanks.
396997	397117	No.
398017	398938	Alright, forget it.
400099	403481	This conversation is going... I also watched a really old movie.
403521	404141	Well, not really old.
404181	405141	It's from a few years ago.
405161	405942	It was an Academy Award.
405962	408744	I watched In the Bedroom.
408964	409344	It was good.
409364	410104	It was sad.
410124	411005	A little bit.
411957	413498	This has nothing to do with gaming whatsoever.
413598	417562	That's what you get when you turn into the afterbirth is you get to hear our stupid stories from the week.
418142	421084	Wouldn't it have been great if they made a game based on the movie?
422145	423006	In the bedroom, the game?
424187	424447	Yes.
426589	428770	No, that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.
429091	430412	As stupid as the guy game?
431673	433694	That's the second stupidest idea I've ever heard.
434575	435896	Have you ever played Chuck Rock?
436537	436737	No.
438178	438478	Rats.
438899	439659	Have you ever played...
441328	443769	I'm trying to think of the worst 8-bit games I've ever played.
444389	446190	Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who.
446290	447391	Have you ever played that game?
449072	449612	What a what?
449712	451493	Why would you make me remember that?
453574	456475	You're so hardcore for remembering a Color Dreams game.
457276	458616	That makes me love you even more.
461397	462558	Remember Color Dreams, Loki?
463719	464299	Color Dreams?
465479	466200	You're so not cool.
467202	468042	It's because you're a kid.
468062	469863	I'm not a kid.
470124	470864	I'm just teasing you.
492870	496132	I mean, you should see, oh my god, we're just lit up with FUs tonight.
496192	501496	Because, like, they're just, and I bet you half of these are gonna say, FU to Sky for cutting out the FUs for the past couple weeks.
501876	502317	You know what?
503257	504098	We've just been busy.
504638	505059	Deal with it.
506440	508301	Alright, let's get into tonight's FUs.
508321	510643	Sorry, I'm queuing up some music we can listen to for the FUs.
510723	512704	So, we'll use some of our old theme songs here.
513445	514585	So we get into chatroom FUs.
514745	514806	FU!
520189	525090	Dark Knight would like to say F you to a six day work week coming up for me and F you to time changes.
525210	525570	Amen.
526771	530531	Fever Maniac 64 says F you to fever as soon as I sit up or stand up.
530591	530971	Headache.
531432	533972	F you to Loki for complaining about his crotch being on fire.
534132	535332	One word for you, pillow.
536072	538893	F you to you guys for maybe confusing what I said about the mouse port.
539213	542934	I'm charging off the port you plug a mouse into on your computer.
544116	545958	F you to myself for being so unwise.
546419	547400	Staying up to 12 a.m.
547420	548801	with a fever is not good.
550883	551724	You're right, sir, it's not.
551764	554627	Laser123452331 says, F you to you, Sky.
555028	557150	Where's my era good cool fat mix MP3?
557210	558832	Oh, yeah, I forgot to send that in my bed.
560034	563835	GK128 says, F you to Microsoft for teasing me with Xbox Live Gold.
564115	565596	Such a short time for free.
565936	566756	Now you ask me to pay $50.
567016	568917	You win, Microsoft.
569977	574439	Fireboma says, F you to my former choir teacher being accused of six counts of child endangerment.
574779	577860	I always wondered why the whiteboard was blocking the window on the door of the classroom.
579209	603223	Yikes Raven's Dolphin says Microsoft making prettier games gets his FU Xbox to Xbox 360 making it prettier for more money FU Microsoft There was a sentence in there somewhere Jazz says FU to Final Fantasy XI I've been camping a monster for a fucking week against guild sellers and he still won't give me his goddamn gloves Squeenix fucking hates me Welcome to Final Fantasy XI
605034	608555	Summer Camp, DarkTetsuya says, F you to Beatmania Songlist.
608575	613036	I could barely scrape together an outphase expert course, let alone a Taku or Taka themed one.
613536	615877	Oh, and F you to the mode that's depicted in the attract mode.
615897	617857	Konami says, it's not actually in the game.
618878	619278	Way to go.
621578	627680	Spirit Snare says, F you to Apple for releasing Boot Camp, which has now really wanted me to make me purchase a Mac.
629316	633277	VxJasonXV says, F you to Cox for sucking something of the same name.
634177	635518	Ranma says, F you to my TV.
635598	639619	My TV turns black and white after a few minutes and it sucks to play games and watch TV on it.
639739	640679	I need a new TV.
640779	641119	Cry.
641999	643420	Roz says, F you to illnesses.
643760	645100	I started off just getting headaches.
645380	647541	It developed into a 103 degree freaking fever.
647841	652982	I somehow screwed up my back and couldn't walk for four damn days which drove me insane because I can't hold still.
653362	658931	Fortunately, I still had Advance Wars, although when you're about to pass out, you will probably not be on top of your game in Tactical Warfare.
659332	662758	Speaking of Advance Crack, F you to Uzyum because it's so incredibly lame.
664673	666154	Xander C says, F you to Latin.
666755	667396	It still isn't done.
667436	668877	People still have to learn Latin?
669558	670298	That makes me sad.
670939	671660	Damn, Romans.
672280	676704	F you to Kingdom Hearts 2, says Xander C. Sure, it rocks, but now I suck even worse at Guitaruman.
677145	679507	F you to my friend for not bringing back my Guitar Hero game.
679927	681369	F you to not having any ecstasy.
681469	682370	Yeah, ecstasy.
682850	683651	Shame, shame.
683811	685653	I hope you mean the song in DDR.
685853	686894	F you to not being a duck.
687394	689617	F you to the big face that chases me down in the kitchen.
691098	691819	I like you.
691859	692839	Too much ecstasy.
693940	698383	Legend of Zaku says F you to not being able to use up all my meals for the week due to Easter vacation.
698944	706269	F you to my school for not acting fast enough to get rid of a mouse that was terrorizing my apartment since we had to corner it and scoop him up in a box and release him outside.
706769	710232	F you to my sneakers since they are on their last breaths leaking water into my feet.
712042	719811	DJ PooEater would like to say F you to the guy who cut me off this morning, making me spill my chocolatey ice cream treat onto my lap.
720251	720792	F you, guy.
720892	721613	Damn you to hell.
721973	723375	I miss my chocolatey treat.
723435	724296	My pants are wet.
724336	725237	My lap is cold.
725457	725818	F you, guy.
726980	746634	GS191 says F you to myself for sucking at Beatmania F you to the postal service for losing my Gamefly mail F you to the MacBook Pro for not having a delete key I have to log into a domain and can't do a control alt delete to log in By the way, I'm not buying a MacBook Pro until they fix this And F you to work for making me work stupid long hours Fuck working in retail
748246	751308	Illusion says, F you to people that hate Bucky O'Hare for NES.
751368	752169	Yay!
752629	758953	SSJ100Matt says, F you to my boss for trying to get me to work on Thursday, which is a Jewish holiday that I requested a month ago.
759754	764056	F you to totally unrelated Skype calls killing everyone else's time that has something related to say.
764457	769080	And F you to Nintendo for not throwing people a curveball and not naming the revolution the dolphin.
771755	778064	and lastly, Agent 47 says F you to EA because they're evil and F you to the guy that directed House of the Dead.
781148	782169	There you go, chat room.
782189	783050	You got your F yous.
783091	783731	Aren't you happy?
784585	785565	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
805115	806196	The chat room is always there.
806256	813040	And I know there's a few people like Dark Knight and Dark Tetsuya and Misty and some of them that check in during the day and will say hi to you if they see you there.
813140	814520	So check that out.
814881	819023	Also, there's also spinoff shows that we do here on this network.
819083	820784	Tuesday nights, pump up the volume.
821204	822905	DarkSakura brings you her request show.
822985	826027	I imagine she will be back, assuming she's over her sickness.
826327	827888	She'll be back this Tuesday at 7 o'clock.
828228	830269	And the Rob Roberts show is on Wednesday at 7 o'clock.
830309	830830	Hey, that's me.
830890	831530	That's my show.
832050	832851	And we, you know...
833331	835654	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
852039	853600	Don't forget the wiki quote.
854300	857942	Matt's wiki quote is currently being queued for deletion.
858422	861223	If you wiki heads want to do anything about that, that would be great.
861543	865465	Somebody suggested merging it into an Orange Lounge Radio article, which I think is a great idea.
865785	869547	Because then somebody could also quote the line from tonight, Resident Evil 4, bitch.
869947	871848	Would be a great quote from tonight and other things.
872208	875949	So save the wiki quote, those of you wiki heads that know how to do that.
875989	877570	But if it gets deleted, we're not going to cry.
878351	879133	It's not the end of the world.
879594	881038	Matt would probably rather see it go.
882421	882963	I'm assuming.
884246	884466	Maybe.
885865	888166	Did you have something you wanted to add, Loki, before we get into Cage Match?
889306	899070	Reading, they have some more info about Red Steel, that game we were talking about in Part A. They're actually talking about some of the stuff that's done with the controller anyways.
899710	902491	This is also from the Game Informer article.
903731	906813	The development of the game started just right after E3 2005, which is interesting.
911033	913534	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
928690	932392	The first, like, third game, they said you have to be extremely brutal in killing people.
934772	935853	What else was kind of cool?
935893	942295	They're going to have multiplayer online and split screen and a bunch of different unique multiplayer modes.
943616	945777	And I don't know.
945817	947457	It says it doesn't feel like a light game.
949158	954060	And it says AI is intelligent, will cover while you're attacking and attack while you're reloading.
955251	982229	and it says the AI is based on benchmarks set by FEAR or the game FEAR looks pretty sweet alright oh and one thing I thought was interesting they're going to have some different like I guess interactive parts where you'll be talking to people and you can are given like yes no answers and you can nod your head using the rev mode for yes or no that's kind of neat
984474	986877	Anything else really quickly before we get into tonight's cage match?
988399	989620	Um, no.
990561	992203	Alright, then let's do the cage match, shall we?
997168	999329	I just passed this song on Beatmania the other day, finally.
999370	999930	Got my way back.
1000170	1002452	You know, I'm getting my skill back at Beatmania, finally.
1002952	1006114	I actually passed a couple of others, even though they were the low-end 4s and 6s.
1006574	1009376	But I passed some 7 stars, and I'm working on the 8s.
1009396	1010797	Because I used to be able to pass Colors.
1011478	1011818	Nemesis.
1011838	1012838	I passed Nemesis once.
1013139	1014640	And that's probably the hardest song I've ever passed.
1014860	1016461	So I'm starting to get my Beatmania skills back.
1017201	1020063	And I ordered 9th Style, because there was a website having a sale.
1020103	1022025	And I'm not going to give them a free plug, but they were selling it.
1022765	1026488	If you want to know, send me a private message, because they're selling it for only $40, which I thought was a good deal.
1027768	1029690	Alright, let's get into Cage Match tonight.
1029750	1031231	Song number one is a holdover.
1031411	1034713	It was DarkSakura's winner for the last two weeks in a row.
1035093	1036434	Will it win again tonight?
1036514	1037654	You guys have the final say.
1037674	1039696	You've got to be in our chat room to play along.
1039776	1040756	OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1040776	1041377	Click on chat.
1041777	1042758	Song number one tonight.
1042838	1044739	It's only a clip because you heard it last week.
1044819	1045999	It's Babyland.
1046340	1049542	Some great indie rock here with Gary is the song.
1049622	1049842	Enjoy.
1211986	1215630	All right, song number one in tonight's cage match, Babyland with Gary.
1216171	1217072	Will it win again tonight?
1217132	1219595	It's up to you after you hear these other two songs.
1219635	1221377	Song number two comes to us from Loki.
1221437	1222378	Loki, what did you pick tonight?
1224921	1225482	Your mic's not on.
1226403	1230027	I picked this song off of this album called Who Am I?
1230047	1231890	It's by, I want to say...
1234269	1235470	Ken O, X-Noise, Diffusion
1271950	1272571	Time, Space
1341556	1342337	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1446584	1449066	Thanks for watching!
1591451	1594775	Okay, that was song number two in tonight's Cage Match X-Noise with Diffusion.
1594795	1597257	Let's go around and see what everybody in the room thought of that one.
1597558	1597878	Loki!
1599600	1600401	Turn your mic on, buddy.
1601081	1601582	I liked it.
1602103	1606447	I have a longer version than I normally listen to, so that one was off of kind of a mix.
1607568	1608409	Um, nine.
1609691	1610051	Spike!
1611873	1613235	I thought it was a pretty good song.
1614907	1616148	And grade it on a scale of 1 to 10.
1616248	1617709	Oh, on a scale of 1 to 10, probably an 8.
1617849	1619229	Alright, super.
1619830	1621330	Uh, Extifer, hi!
1622251	1622771	Hello.
1622851	1623792	What would you give that song?
1624132	1626193	I would give it a damn 8.
1626753	1626813	An 8.
1627714	1628334	Any reason why?
1629314	1630935	Absolutely no reason whatsoever.
1632196	1635878	Nelly, what would you give your fiancé's song there that he put in the cage, Matt?
1636978	1639520	I wasn't listening, but I'll give it a 10 because I love him.
1641577	1644158	Aw, she's putting porn on my laptop, by the way.
1644178	1644838	I know, I noticed that.
1645519	1651061	Why are you such a... Nelly, why are you just... She really is putting porn on your laptop.
1651221	1656982	Nelly, why are you... Oh my, that's a... Why are you putting that on his laptop?
1657423	1659543	Because look how disgusting, that'd be so funny.
1660124	1664965	Like, if he shows it to somebody and he doesn't know it's there, like, I shouldn't even show him that I'm putting it on there.
1664985	1666486	They know it's there.
1666566	1668806	Do you endorse your fiancé looking at porn?
1669267	1669787	Absolutely.
1670754	1671114	Okay.
1673035	1673415	All right.
1675677	1676017	All right.
1676297	1677938	Let's go to song number three.
1677978	1679599	Song number three is my pick tonight.
1680379	1685301	It's the goth in me that's making me put in this song, or the EBM master.
1685342	1686102	I don't know what to say.
1686502	1687623	But I like this band.
1688103	1690424	They've been around forever, but I've just started really liking them.
1690444	1691785	And this is their new single.
1692345	1695247	It's called Chrome, and the band is VNV Nation.
1695487	1695747	Enjoy.
1981877	1986484	Okay, that was song number three in tonight's cage match, BNV Nation with Chrome.
1986624	1990670	Let's have a look and see what the folks in the studio thought of that one.
1990690	1990990	Loki.
1991391	1992112	That was okay.
1992732	1996338	Seven, I was a bit distracted by my fiancé trying to put four in my laptop.
1996538	1996978	Aren't we all?
1997018	1997339	Spike.
1998320	2000662	I'd have to give that one probably a 9.
2001002	2002202	I'm a big fan of VNV.
2002243	2006105	I used to spin them at clubs years back, following them for a long time.
2006165	2007065	I really like those guys.
2007085	2009607	Spike, do you have any live shows coming up you want to plug?
2009747	2011748	I should have given you another opportunity on the podcast.
2012209	2017472	I have something coming up, but I don't want to talk about it until it's a good deal, but probably in late May I'll be doing a few clubs.
2018673	2020775	Come back to the show and give it a plug.
2021736	2023298	Throw in something gaming related for us.
2023338	2023818	That's all we ask.
2023838	2027242	Well, I'd probably close the night with one of the Xanadu mixes from DDR.
2027642	2028523	You're so badass.
2028824	2031146	Because, well, the thing is, one of the shows would be at a gay club.
2031687	2032708	Okay, there you go.
2032808	2033509	Xanadu, bam.
2036170	2043632	I think I will associate Cunt with that song because I saw it on Loki's computer.
2044292	2047153	So that deserves a pretty much a 9.
2047413	2049194	I'm glad to hear it.
2049674	2052135	Nelly, what did you think of VNV Nation with Chrome?
2053140	2055081	Again, wasn't listening, so I'll give it a 10.
2056622	2057262	Yay.
2057523	2057843	Yay.
2058563	2061365	I give that song like a 9 because I like VMV Nation.
2061445	2063586	That song makes me want to dance like I'm in Silent Hill.
2065627	2066788	Like the people do at the club.
2066808	2069649	Like if you've ever been to the golf club, they dance like they're in Silent Hill.
2069689	2073051	They're like... The sirens are going off.
2074632	2076933	All right, place vote now.
2077033	2079035	Let's review the three songs you can vote for tonight.
2079095	2080996	Song number one, Babyland, Gary.
2081016	2081216	Babyland.
2085578	2089580	And song number two you can vote for tonight, X-Noise with Diffusion.
2091461	2092082	That's a bad clip.
2092122	2092722	Let's try that again.
2092842	2094643	X-Noise with Diffusion.
2097685	2099066	I can't find a good clip for this song.
2099086	2100006	Here we go.
2100086	2100346	Here we go.
2100366	2100867	Get the beat.
2100887	2103728	Get the beat.
2103748	2104108	Here we go.
2109996	2115356	And song number three you can vote for tonight is VNV Nation with Chrome.
2123914	2124895	Lace vote now.
2125015	2131022	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.
2131042	2138250	You guys have about 60 seconds to do it because we're about ready to pull the plug on this show because if you can believe it, we've been on air for three and a half hours straight.
2138530	2139091	We need air.
2139471	2140312	We need to go outside.
2140772	2142294	Extifer, you came into the studio.
2142334	2143956	I'm sure you wanted to ruin the show somehow.
2143996	2144697	What do you want to say?
2146245	2147265	I didn't have anything.
2147285	2149566	I bought Harry Potter in Russian today.
2149746	2150026	Why?
2150586	2151786	Because it's pretty cool.
2152086	2152807	Did you watch it yet?
2153387	2154247	I watched some of it.
2154527	2157208	Now, for those that don't know, you're learning Russian.
2157308	2157748	Mm-hmm.
2157828	2166470	Now, some folks figured this out because I posted a picture of the TV on our forums over at OrangeSoundsRadio.com because I was showing my Xbox 360 with a Mario Kart background.
2166590	2166830	Right.
2167150	2171451	And you can actually see the little tag on the TV that says the word television in Russian.
2171731	2171871	Mm-hmm.
2172531	2176454	And that's because you have scattered the apartment with index cards.
2176474	2178815	They're only supposed to be there a week, if I remember right.
2179335	2181977	I can take them off now.
2182017	2182778	I know them now.
2182798	2183338	No, it's fine.
2185399	2186600	How do you say television in Russian?
2186620	2187801	So he's learning.
2190785	2191666	I like lesbians.
2224003	2225804	I told ya!
2226084	2226785	I told ya!
2227025	2229406	Boy, God, you really lucked out, didn't you?
2229806	2237250	Nelly's the funniest person in the world, and the reason why is because earlier we watched the Silent Hill making of little thing.
2237270	2238570	I already told this story during the show.
2238590	2238931	Oh, man.
2238951	2239371	I'm sorry.
2239771	2240351	You can do it again.
2240371	2242032	You can tell your way if you want.
2242072	2243273	No, she's just funny.
2243293	2246114	She's just like, pussy scared of paper.
2247375	2248355	That's so funny.
2249916	2251717	You guys are so easily amused.
2252829	2253490	Not funny.
2253950	2254550	It's funny.
2254790	2257872	People should go to Nelly's MySpace, too.
2258133	2260474	Nelly has the best MySpace I've ever seen.
2260914	2262856	You don't even have Orange Launch Radio friended, though, do you?
2263396	2264697	No, but I will today.
2265721	2267681	Well, then how can they find Nelly on Myspace?
2268082	2269002	What's your username?
2269022	2269902	I don't know.
2270022	2270382	Nelly.
2270902	2271522	Is it just Nelly?
2271642	2272342	Yes.
2272462	2274103	So it's not going to bring up the rapper?
2274203	2275343	No, it will bring up the rapper.
2275383	2279904	What you got to do, it's kind of like the six degrees of Orange Lounge or something.
2280444	2283825	Go to Orange Lounge, go to Rob's page.
2284425	2286065	No, because she's not in my top eight right now.
2286105	2286845	She's in my top eight.
2286865	2288026	She's in Extover's top eight, though.
2288066	2290926	Okay, so go to Orange Lounge and Extover's in the top eight and then Nelly.
2291266	2292947	And your picture isn't really of you, though.
2293007	2294427	It's of you throwing babies, right?
2294447	2294487	No.
2294943	2295743	See, you gave it away!
2295783	2299825	I was going to say, it's a picture of my favorite sport, which is baby throwing.
2299885	2303946	It's hilarious, and nobody at my work thought it was funny because of bastards.
2304726	2308328	Seriously, Nellie has the best MySpace page I've ever seen, and you'll know why when you go there.
2308408	2315510	So go to the Orange Launch Radio MySpace, then hop over to Xtapers, and then make sure your sound's up, and hop over to Nellie's.
2317611	2318831	And I helped.
2322545	2325826	I need to count up cage match votes now, so somebody's got to fill time.
2327647	2329067	Matt, help us fill time here.
2329207	2332308	Loki, think of a story that we haven't talked about yet tonight.
2332528	2335749	Well, let's see here.
2335769	2349033	I was going to say, there's another grant that's out of Liberty City Stories, PSP cheat device update, and they added now where you can just the water levels, so you can flood cities and stuff and drive around the boat, which is kind of fun.
2350493	2356536	You know, and I'm surprised they should really put out tools like that because it is, you know, it adds more replayability to the game.
2357377	2368002	And I hope that they take, you know, a lesson from, you know, the users' requests on, like, you know, more customization for the multiplayer games and stuff like that because it really needs it.
2369881	2376624	Other than that, I was going to say I hope I get my Game Informer soon because everyone gets theirs before me.
2376844	2379405	I haven't got my new issue of Xbox Magazine.
2379425	2380786	It's already in newsstands.
2381166	2385288	What the hell is the point of subscribing to a magazine then if I'm getting it late?
2385448	2387208	What are the demos on the new Xbox Magazine?
2387709	2388469	Is it worth me buying?
2388809	2391990	The new Xbox Magazine is going to have a 360 demo on there.
2392110	2392871	It was something good.
2392951	2396492	I want to say the 360 version of...
2399962	2401023	Hitman, Blood Money.
2401583	2402483	I want to say it's on there.
2402863	2405584	I can't be positive, but I thought that's what it was.
2406324	2408305	I do know it has Hitman on there as a demo.
2408325	2410105	I'm not sure if it's current gen or next gen.
2410245	2413706	Oh, God, what else was on there?
2414147	2415387	Just some really good demos.
2415407	2418308	I want to say Hitman was on there.
2418948	2419628	I can't remember, though.
2419848	2421149	I looked at it for like half a second.
2422609	2423930	But Game Informer is always good.
2424250	2425370	They're always near the one.
2425910	2428291	It's really weird because their website...
2428951	2431553	A lot of the news is really sketchy.
2431673	2434035	Some of it's accurate, most of it's not.
2434615	2437417	But in their magazine, it's pretty accurate.
2437617	2440779	It seems to be like they have a lot of exclusives and stuff.
2440799	2444302	There's such a separation between the website and the actual magazine.
2447584	2449065	You ready to hear who won tonight's cage match?
2449705	2449866	Sure.
2451606	2458929	It was a landslide vote tonight, and although all three songs got a pretty fair amount of votes, we had a lot of participation tonight.
2458969	2459810	Thank you, chat room.
2459850	2462991	Thank you for exercising your democratic right to vote.
2463631	2464051	I'm sorry.
2464151	2466652	I will shove this microphone up your pee hole.
2467873	2473375	The song, the winning song tonight is X-Noise with Diffusion.
2476493	2476773	There you go.
2476873	2480435	You know, it was either this or a song that was by Rammstein.
2480495	2481876	It sounded like it should be in Silent Hill.
2483877	2487298	And SSJ100Matt would like to remind you, P. Diddy says vote or die.
2488099	2488559	Vote or die.
2488699	2491820	Even though I don't think P. Diddy voted in some of the earlier elections.
2491860	2492201	But hey.
2492421	2493401	It's Diddy now.
2493621	2494122	Oh, I'm sorry.
2494602	2495462	Diddy what?
2495682	2496283	Diddy what?
2496303	2496763	Wait, wait.
2497243	2497823	It's just Diddy?
2498284	2498804	He lost the P?
2500240	2501540	A fucking artist.
2501580	2502921	Someone knocked the P out of him.
2503001	2503981	Stick with a name.
2504241	2504781	Yeah, I know.
2504821	2506281	Just pick a name and stick with it.
2506941	2514663	You know, it's like, you know, they're not like, you know, different clothes or whatever, or Pokemon cards or something like that.
2514703	2523404	Extover, your audio is so jacked up tonight because I had to turn it up for Spike, and now that you've got it, you're like... Yeah, that's exactly what you sound like.
2523444	2523845	Cranbor.
2523885	2525965	Just take the mic away a little bit.
2526909	2528109	Nobody needs me!
2528169	2529189	Nobody needs me!
2529209	2530070	Hobobot or whatever.
2530110	2530310	Winobot.
2530330	2531530	I learn new things about porn every day.
2553206	2554927	Cunts really do look like flowers.
2555167	2559448	Alright, here it is kids, your fortune cookie message of the day.
2587868	2589569	Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki
2616474	2618115	Thank you for watching!
2642648	2643809	Thank you for watching!
2685121	2688003	And there it is, the Kotimu version of V. Always a good time.
