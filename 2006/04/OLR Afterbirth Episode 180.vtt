WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:24.520
Alright boys and girls, we're back here for the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth, it's that

00:24.520 --> 00:28.520
part of the show that's too hot to podcast, only available when you listen live here on

00:28.520 --> 00:34.640
OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Let's see, what should we get into first? How about a little bit

00:34.640 --> 00:39.200
of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day? Chat room, go ahead and send me your FUs. Send

00:39.200 --> 00:42.960
them over a private message. I have neglected them for the past two weeks. It's high time

00:42.960 --> 00:47.280
we got to read some for you guys. So go ahead and private message me your FUs and we'll

00:47.280 --> 00:50.280
read them tonight. In the meantime, let's do a little bit of How Was Your Week, How

00:50.280 --> 00:52.760
Was Your Day. Loki, you want to start us off?

00:52.760 --> 01:01.520
my week. I finally got my bonus money to which I purchased my laptop. I got this

01:01.520 --> 01:14.200
gateway. It's an MX 7525. An Athlon, a mobile Athlon 64 bit 4000 plus. It's got, well

01:14.200 --> 01:17.640
had 1 gig of RAM in it, now has a gig and a half because that's all that the

01:17.640 --> 01:21.440
motherboard will allow. 100 gig hard drive, which is all the motherboard will

01:21.440 --> 01:31.120
allow, because I think it's a bit older. Windows Media Center Edition and an ATI Mobility X600

01:31.120 --> 01:36.380
card with 128 megabytes of RAM dedicated and 128 that it shares from the main RAM, which

01:36.380 --> 01:44.000
is awesome. And it's pretty hot. I mean, literally pretty hot. My lap is really warm. I need

01:44.000 --> 01:49.480
to really get one of those cool mats for this, but it's a pretty slick computer. It's got

01:49.480 --> 01:53.660
interesting stuff on it. The only thing I don't like about it, one it's Gateway. I

01:53.660 --> 01:58.100
don't really dig the cow computers too much, but this was an open box computer

01:58.100 --> 02:06.400
so I got it for $300 less than it was, and so it wasn't bad. And also it's gonna be great

02:06.400 --> 02:15.140
for video editing. That's all I can say about that. And what else? Yeah, bought an

02:15.140 --> 02:20.500
G2 card for it. It's pretty slick and good for podcasts. It's just gonna be pretty nice

02:20.500 --> 02:24.580
to have something on the go. I did get an orange backpack that goes with it, you know,

02:24.580 --> 02:34.420
because I want to be cheesy like nerd. And yeah, it's gonna be awesome. All right. Spike,

02:34.420 --> 02:37.860
thank you for filling in tonight. Appreciate it. It was my pleasure. It's always a good time.

02:37.860 --> 02:41.140
Sorry to take you away from festivities in the living room for a little while, you know,

02:41.140 --> 02:44.780
to do our crappy little show, but we appreciate your contributions.

02:44.780 --> 02:49.300
And by the way, cosplay at Fanime, per our conversation at IHOP earlier, is

02:49.300 --> 02:50.180
gonna rock.

02:50.180 --> 02:54.260
I have the best idea ever. This will be a legendary cosplay, that's all I have to say.

02:54.260 --> 02:57.620
It took everything in my power not to bring it up during the show.

02:57.620 --> 03:01.460
I appreciate that. I'm gonna wow you all with my elite cosplay skills.

03:01.460 --> 03:04.900
How was your week? How was your day?

03:04.900 --> 03:07.940
My week was really great, except that I hate,

03:07.940 --> 03:11.780
you know having to earn money to make my life happen

03:11.780 --> 03:15.060
i know that all like earning money things i do

03:15.060 --> 03:17.340
jobs are so overrated

03:17.340 --> 03:20.160
seriously

03:20.160 --> 03:21.160
on them but uh...

03:21.160 --> 03:23.180
no much my day and my weekend

03:23.180 --> 03:27.860
which i've you know spent in your apartment has been awesome

03:27.860 --> 03:29.540
i'm glad you had a good time

03:29.540 --> 03:31.060
my part is a fun time

03:31.060 --> 03:33.300
not as fun as my bedroom though

03:33.300 --> 03:34.140
just kidding

03:34.140 --> 03:35.220
jokes i

03:35.220 --> 03:37.860
old snap so

03:37.860 --> 03:40.020
cosplay

03:40.020 --> 03:46.540
i want to be a duck don't you know what that now you just jump the shark nana

03:46.540 --> 03:48.020
anything else bike

03:48.020 --> 03:52.200
no i'm not really i spent my whole week with my free time playing kingdom hearts

03:52.200 --> 03:53.060
and uh...

03:53.060 --> 03:56.140
final fantasy eleven which i was hoping was twelve

03:56.140 --> 03:58.060
and it didn't work out that way

03:58.060 --> 03:59.100
mom sorry

03:59.100 --> 04:02.180
i'm i'm gonna come back to promise eleven this week i took a week break

04:02.180 --> 04:04.700
because they need to get me put off some time to catch up to us

04:04.700 --> 04:08.500
If you really want to play Final Fantasy XI with us, you can always send me a private message

04:08.500 --> 04:11.560
on the forums. Don't send it to me in chat, because I'll miss it tonight.

04:11.560 --> 04:14.460
Best way is to send me an email or private message and we'll get you.

04:14.460 --> 04:18.940
If you want to play me on Xbox Live sometime, just know this,

04:18.940 --> 04:21.620
because some more people have been adding me to Xbox Live lately,

04:21.620 --> 04:25.500
just because I do a podcast on video games with my friends does not necessarily

04:25.500 --> 04:27.860
mean I am very good at gaming.

04:27.860 --> 04:31.740
It means I love gaming. I like to play games. That doesn't mean I'm good at them.

04:31.740 --> 04:33.900
So chances are you will kick my ass.

04:33.900 --> 04:37.300
so please don't expect that i will actually be a challenge chances are

04:37.300 --> 04:40.260
i will be like you know playing a ten-year-old i was a one hell of a

04:40.260 --> 04:43.620
challenge at full auto unfortunately i sold the game back because i got all my

04:43.620 --> 04:45.540
achievement points damn you

04:45.540 --> 04:49.580
but if i were to borrow it again i would be one hell of a match

04:49.580 --> 04:52.180
it was just one of those games you know

04:52.180 --> 04:53.780
online wasn't that great

04:53.780 --> 04:55.660
it was laggy and

04:55.660 --> 04:59.460
really glitchy at times so

04:59.460 --> 05:00.940
full auto 2

05:00.940 --> 05:04.900
when that comes out second uh... i'd love that game

05:04.900 --> 05:05.900
needs

05:05.900 --> 05:06.980
death match

05:06.980 --> 05:10.340
needs a death match like twisted metal because i think that's the only thing is

05:10.340 --> 05:15.340
missing from a game is twist mill style death match

05:15.340 --> 05:19.220
uh... let's sell my week in my day uh... i don't really have a whole lot to say

05:19.220 --> 05:23.220
outside of the gaming stuff uh... you know just uh... i have with the casino

05:23.220 --> 05:26.740
was fun i guess this weekend even though i lost money it was good to just kind of

05:26.740 --> 05:28.100
go with friends and hang out

05:28.100 --> 05:30.880
watch some movies friday night uh... watch

05:30.880 --> 05:34.000
mister mrs smith which i hadn't seen yet

05:34.000 --> 05:37.280
that was funny i like it would you just made a wincing noise over there low-key

05:37.280 --> 05:41.660
in like it was okay it was funny it was a fun movie why do people hate on

05:41.660 --> 05:45.840
angelina jolie so but she's really funny like i really like to remember the

05:45.840 --> 05:48.980
i don't know why it's considered like selling out to be an angelina jolie

05:48.980 --> 05:50.540
fan she's really funny

05:50.540 --> 05:54.060
so what if she's like you know adopts cambodians or whatever i think that's

05:54.060 --> 05:56.800
She's into helping the world and all that stuff.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.160
You say it like it's a bad thing, like we should throw rocks at her for it.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.760
People make fun of her for it all the time.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.760
Do you watch E?

06:05.760 --> 06:09.780
I know you watch the same shows I do on E television, they totally rag on her all the

06:09.780 --> 06:10.780
time.

06:10.780 --> 06:11.780
There's nothing...

06:11.780 --> 06:15.240
That's for being crazy and having her ex-husband's blood in a vial around her neck, it has nothing

06:15.240 --> 06:16.240
to do with the children.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.240
Okay well that's a little weird.

06:18.240 --> 06:23.900
Okay you know what though, that just makes her kind of like Frankie in a, I don't know.

06:23.900 --> 06:26.840
I had the making out with her brother thing, but come on, the blood?

06:26.840 --> 06:28.180
He wasn't even hot.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.320
I know.

06:30.320 --> 06:33.740
Like that would have made it okay. The brother was pretty good looking, her brother.

06:33.740 --> 06:37.980
But yeah, her ex, Billy Bob, yeah, no, thanks, no, bleh.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.060
Alright, forget it.

06:40.060 --> 06:41.860
This conversation is going, eepshh.

06:41.860 --> 06:45.140
I also watched a really old movie, well not really old, it's from like a few years ago,

06:45.140 --> 06:47.980
it was Academy Award, I watched In the Bedroom.

06:47.980 --> 06:48.900
It was, you know,

06:48.900 --> 06:50.640
it was good, it was sad,

06:50.640 --> 06:51.940
a little bit.

06:51.940 --> 06:54.660
this has nothing to do with gaming whatsoever that's what you get when you turn into the

06:54.660 --> 06:56.260
afterbirth is you get to hear our

06:56.260 --> 06:59.140
our stupid stories from the week. Wouldn't it have been great if they

06:59.140 --> 07:01.980
made a game based on the movie?

07:01.980 --> 07:04.140
What, in the bedroom the game?

07:04.140 --> 07:06.300
Yes.

07:06.300 --> 07:11.640
No, that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard. As stupid as the guy game?

07:11.640 --> 07:14.520
That's the second stupidest idea I've ever heard.

07:14.520 --> 07:18.120
Have you ever played Chuck Rock? No.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.280

07:21.280 --> 07:24.280

07:29.040 --> 07:33.560

07:33.560 --> 07:37.240

07:45.440 --> 07:47.160

07:47.160 --> 07:49.160
It's because you're a kid.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.160
I'm not a kid. I'm just teasing you.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.160
Someone in the chatroom just badmouthed

07:53.160 --> 07:55.160
the Bucky O'Hare game for NES.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.160
I think that was a Konami game. That game was awesome.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.160
I don't think I played it, I gotta be honest.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.160
It played like a licensed Mega Man game.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.160
Really.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.160
Wow, that's cool.

08:05.160 --> 08:07.160
Alright, let's go to the chatroom and read

08:07.160 --> 08:09.160

12:10.500 --> 12:13.420
F you to the Postal Service for losing my Gamefly mail.

12:13.420 --> 12:16.180
F you to the MacBook Pro for not having a delete key.

12:16.180 --> 12:19.780
I have to log into a domain and can't do a control alt delete to log in.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.980
By the way, I'm not buying a MacBook Pro until they fix this.

12:22.980 --> 12:25.700
And F you to work for making me work stupid long hours.

12:25.700 --> 12:28.300
Fuck working in retail.

12:28.300 --> 12:31.500
Illusions says F you to people that hate Bucky O'Hare for NES.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.500
Yay!

12:32.500 --> 12:37.140
SSJ100Matt says F you to my boss for trying to get me to work on Thursday which is a Jewish

12:37.140 --> 12:39.740
holiday that I requested a month ago.

12:39.740 --> 12:43.580
F you to totally unrelated Skype calls killing everyone else's time that has something related

12:43.580 --> 12:48.480
to say and F you to Nintendo for not throwing people a curveball and not naming the revolution

12:48.480 --> 12:56.660

12:56.660 --> 13:03.220
guy that directed house of the dead there you go chat room you got your F use aren't

13:03.220 --> 13:09.920
you happy now stop your bitching so much gosh it's painful no our show would be nothing

13:09.920 --> 13:13.620
without the chat room and we appreciate you guys over like 40 people in chat

13:13.620 --> 13:16.660
right now we love it we love this attention that you guys show us our chat

13:16.660 --> 13:20.940
room is open 24-7 during the week although we know you guys you know have

13:20.940 --> 13:23.720
other things you want to do than lurk in our chat room all the time necessarily

13:23.720 --> 13:27.900
but the chat rooms always there and I know like there's a few people like dark

13:27.900 --> 13:30.800
night and dark Tetsuya and misty and some of them that check in during the

13:30.800 --> 13:35.960
day and we'll say hi to you if they see you there so check that out also there's

13:35.960 --> 13:39.100
There's also spin-off shows that we do here on this network.

13:39.100 --> 13:42.900
Tuesday nights, pump up the volume, Dark Sakura brings you her quest show.

13:42.900 --> 13:46.420
I imagine she will be back, assuming she's over her sickness.

13:46.420 --> 13:49.900
She'll be back this Tuesday at 7 o'clock, and the Rob Roberts show is on Wednesday at

13:49.900 --> 13:50.900
7 o'clock.

13:50.900 --> 13:56.980
Hey, that's me, that's my show, and we play music and talk about tech geek stuff and whatever

13:56.980 --> 13:58.060
sounds like fun.

13:58.060 --> 14:02.860
And if you're Xander, you hate all the music that I play, so, you know, because I have

14:02.860 --> 14:08.540
bad taste in music apparently. Well I do, didn't you get the memo that was going around

14:08.540 --> 14:15.900
the office? Alright, oh, don't forget the wiki quote. Matt's wiki quote is currently

14:15.900 --> 14:20.780
being queued for deletion. If you wikiheads want to do anything about that, that would

14:20.780 --> 14:24.660
be great. Somebody suggested merging it into an Orange Launch radio article, which I think

14:24.660 --> 14:28.740
is a great idea, because then somebody could also quote the line from Tonight Resident

14:28.740 --> 14:33.060
Evil 4 bitch would be a great quote from tonight and other things so save the

14:33.060 --> 14:36.460
wiki quote those you wiki heads that know how to do that but if it gets

14:36.460 --> 14:39.900
deleted we're not gonna cry it's not the end of the world that Matt would

14:39.900 --> 14:47.300
probably rather see it go I'm assuming maybe are you just want to add lucky

14:47.300 --> 14:51.500
before we get in the cage match reading they have some more info about red steel

14:51.500 --> 14:56.540
we're talking about in the first part a they're actually talking about like some

14:56.540 --> 15:01.740
of the stuff that's done with the controller anyways. This is also from the Game Informer

15:01.740 --> 15:11.660
article. The development of the game started just right after E3 2005, which is interesting.

15:11.660 --> 15:16.160
Basically it's going to be a martial arts setting. The camera will be controlled by

15:16.160 --> 15:22.460
the rev mode. The analog stick and the two buttons are going to be for moving and jumping

15:22.460 --> 15:29.340
up and down, or jumping and ducking, I should say. You can actually... the first, like,

15:29.340 --> 15:35.360
third game, they said you have to be extremely brutal in killing people. What else was kind

15:35.360 --> 15:40.960
of cool? They're going to have multiplayer online in split screen, and a bunch of different

15:40.960 --> 15:47.960
unique multiplayer modes, and... I don't know, it says it doesn't feel like a light game.

15:47.960 --> 15:53.960
And it says, AI is intelligent, will cover while you're attacking, and attack while you're reloading.

15:54.060 --> 15:59.960
And it says, the AI is based on benchmarks set by fear, or the game Fear.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.960
So, looks pretty sweet.

16:03.060 --> 16:04.960
Alright.

16:05.060 --> 16:06.960
Oh, and one thing I thought was interesting.

16:07.060 --> 16:12.960
They're going to have some different like, I guess, interactive parts where you'll be talking to people.

16:12.960 --> 16:17.880
and you can are given like yes no answers and you can nod your head using

16:17.880 --> 16:25.720
the rev mode for yes or no kind of anything else really quickly before we

16:25.720 --> 16:31.640
get into tonight's cage match no all right then let's do the cage match

16:31.640 --> 16:39.660
shall we I just passed the song on beat mania the other day finally got my way

16:39.660 --> 16:42.980
way back I you know I'm getting my skill back at beatmania finally I can I

16:42.980 --> 16:45.780
actually passed a couple of others even though they were the low-end fours and

16:45.780 --> 16:49.860
sixes but I passed some seven stars I'm working on the eights because I used to

16:49.860 --> 16:53.300
be able to pass colors that was a nemesis I passed nemesis once that's

16:53.300 --> 16:56.020
probably the hardest song I've ever passed so I'm starting to get my beatmania

16:56.020 --> 16:59.780
skills back and I ordered night style because there was a website having a

16:59.780 --> 17:02.900
sale and I'm not gonna give them a free plug but they were selling it if you

17:02.900 --> 17:05.620
want to know send me a private message because they're selling it for only $40

17:05.620 --> 17:09.620
which I thought was a good deal so alright let's get into cage match night

17:09.620 --> 17:13.820
song number one is a holdover it was dark Sakura's winner for the last two

17:13.820 --> 17:17.940
weeks in a row will it win again tonight you guys have the final say you got to

17:17.940 --> 17:21.900
be in our chat room to play along orange launch radio.com click on chat song

17:21.900 --> 17:24.900
number one tonight it's only a clip because you heard it last week it's

17:24.900 --> 17:31.800
Babyland, some great indie rock here with Gary is the song. Enjoy!

17:54.900 --> 18:10.260
We grow from experience We go on because we know there's nothing worth

18:10.260 --> 18:16.260
And quitting to bow down to the negatives

18:18.260 --> 18:20.260
We hold strong

18:20.260 --> 18:24.260
Because we know there's something worth awaiting

18:25.260 --> 18:28.260
This is the part of me that I understand

18:29.260 --> 18:34.260
No, I can't control the wonder that I'm surprised

18:35.260 --> 18:38.260
It's building, it's building

18:38.260 --> 18:46.260
Don't tell me I'm wrong I'm living hard to be part of something new

18:46.260 --> 18:52.260
The straight lines and the stereotypes are gone

18:52.260 --> 18:59.260
As nature continues to crawl Curved lines in the big city skies

18:59.260 --> 19:04.260
Bright lights and open your eyes to your eyes

19:09.260 --> 19:14.260
We live for the experience

19:15.260 --> 19:22.260
We go on because we know there's something to this wanting

19:22.260 --> 19:27.260
Drown it in your eyes

19:29.260 --> 19:34.260
Drown it in your eyes

19:34.260 --> 19:36.260
Let's go!

20:00.260 --> 20:02.260
I've got the super power

20:02.260 --> 20:05.260
I do what I can, but that ain't gonna fly

20:05.260 --> 20:09.260
Cause I know what I am and I apologize

20:35.260 --> 20:39.260
I can't remember the artist who puts the compilation together.

20:39.260 --> 20:47.260
But anyways, it's this song brought to you by this group called XNoise, and it's called

20:47.260 --> 20:48.260
Diffusion.

20:48.260 --> 20:51.260
It kind of reminds me of a Beatmania song.

20:51.260 --> 20:54.260
Alright, here it is, XNoise with Diffusion, song number two.

20:54.260 --> 20:56.260
Enjoy

21:24.260 --> 21:28.260
Space, energy, an illusion

22:24.260 --> 22:26.260
Oh

23:24.260 --> 23:26.260
Oh

24:24.260 --> 24:26.260
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

25:24.260 --> 25:26.260
Oh

25:54.260 --> 25:56.260
Oh

26:24.260 --> 26:34.860
Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, X-Noise with Diffusion.

26:34.860 --> 26:37.740
Let's go around and see what everybody in the room thought of that one.

26:37.740 --> 26:38.740
Loki!

26:38.740 --> 26:40.980
Turn your mic on, buddy.

26:40.980 --> 26:41.980
I liked it.

26:41.980 --> 26:47.380
I have a longer version than I normally listen to, so that one's off of a mix.

26:47.380 --> 26:48.380
Nine.

26:48.380 --> 26:49.380
Spike!

26:49.380 --> 26:55.020
I thought it was a pretty good song.

26:55.020 --> 26:56.180
And graded on a scale of 1-10?

26:56.180 --> 26:58.460
Oh, on a scale of 1-10, probably an 8.

26:58.460 --> 26:59.460
Alright, super.

26:59.460 --> 27:00.460
Uh, Xtafur, hi!

27:00.460 --> 27:01.460
Hello!

27:01.460 --> 27:04.080
What would you give that song?

27:04.080 --> 27:06.780
I would give it a damn 8.

27:06.780 --> 27:07.780
An 8.

27:07.780 --> 27:09.180
Any reason why?

27:09.180 --> 27:11.380
Absolutely no reason whatsoever.

27:11.380 --> 27:16.900
Nelly, what would you give your fiancé's song there that he put in the cage mat?

27:16.900 --> 27:20.700
I wasn't listening, but I'll give it a 10 because I love him.

27:20.700 --> 27:21.700
Awwwwww.

27:21.700 --> 27:25.580
She's putting porn on my laptop, by the way.

27:25.580 --> 27:26.580
Why are you such a...

27:26.580 --> 27:27.580
Nellie, why are you just...

27:27.580 --> 27:30.580
She really is putting porn on your laptop.

27:30.580 --> 27:31.580
Nellie!

27:31.580 --> 27:32.580
Why are you...

27:32.580 --> 27:33.580
That's...

27:33.580 --> 27:34.580
Oh my...

27:34.580 --> 27:35.580
That's a f***ing matter.

27:35.580 --> 27:36.580
Why are you...

27:36.580 --> 27:37.580
Why are you putting that on his laptop?

27:37.580 --> 27:38.580
Because look how disgusting.

27:38.580 --> 27:39.580
That'd be so funny.

27:39.580 --> 27:40.580
Like, if he shows it to somebody and he doesn't know it's there, like, I shouldn't even show

27:40.580 --> 27:41.580
him that I'm putting it on there.

27:41.580 --> 27:46.580
I know it's there.

27:46.580 --> 27:49.120
Do you endorse your fiance looking at porn?

27:49.120 --> 27:50.120
Absolutely.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.120
Okay.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.120
Can't be a hypocrite.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.120
Alright.

27:54.120 --> 27:58.080
Alright, let's go to song number three.

27:58.080 --> 28:01.480
Song number three is my pick tonight.

28:01.480 --> 28:05.520
It's the goth in me that's making me put in this song, or the EBM master, I don't know

28:05.520 --> 28:09.720
what to say, but I like this band, they've been around forever, but I've just started

28:09.720 --> 28:10.720
really liking them.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.400
And this is their new single.

28:12.400 --> 28:19.400
It's called Chrome and the band is VNV Nation, enjoy.

28:42.400 --> 28:52.400
A million faces each, a million lies For each and all, a crown disguise

28:52.400 --> 28:59.400
Prompts for action, false reaction Embodied promise to a machine so pure

28:59.400 --> 29:07.400
Have the measure of blind ambition The testament to your singular disease

29:07.400 --> 29:15.400
Get so wisdom you heed no warning Your desires giving you away

29:22.400 --> 29:29.400
If I could change your mind I wouldn't save you from the path you wander

29:29.400 --> 29:35.400
In desperation dreams And this soul can set you free

29:35.400 --> 29:39.400
And I still hear you scream

29:39.400 --> 29:44.400
And everyone, you'll never see no motion

29:44.400 --> 29:50.400
Fighting innocence, a fire to set you free

29:51.400 --> 29:54.400
Your actions turn conquest to dust

29:54.400 --> 29:56.400
Importance to fate

29:56.400 --> 29:59.400
You foolishly place trust

29:59.400 --> 30:02.400
Sense fear in your broken breathing

30:02.400 --> 30:06.400
Resolve to shadows till your body splires

30:06.400 --> 30:10.400
All creation has a promise of heaven

30:10.400 --> 30:13.400
Until you travel the road to hell

30:13.400 --> 30:17.400
I'm saying nothing for the good of myself

30:17.400 --> 30:21.400
But I'm still talking and you're not listening

30:21.400 --> 30:23.400
If I could change your mind

30:23.400 --> 30:28.400
I wouldn't save you from the path you wander

30:28.400 --> 30:30.400
In desperation dreams

30:30.400 --> 30:34.400
And this soul can set you free

30:34.400 --> 30:37.400
And I still hear you scream

30:37.400 --> 30:39.400
In every breath

30:39.400 --> 30:43.400
In every single motion

30:43.400 --> 30:45.400
But in innocence

30:45.400 --> 30:50.400
A fire to set you free

31:45.400 --> 32:03.400
Snythe descends upon the city The streets are cold, the lights go by

32:03.400 --> 32:17.400
In the stories of the people A million faces, a million lives

32:17.400 --> 32:32.400
They'll never say they feel what you feel But they can see the world you see

32:32.400 --> 32:47.400
And in their faces there are explosions A million faces, a million lies

32:47.400 --> 33:06.760
Okay, that was song number three in tonight's gauge match, BnV Nation with Chrome.

33:06.760 --> 33:11.080
Let's have a look and see what the folks in the studio thought of that one, Loki.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.080
That was okay.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.080
This is seven.

33:13.080 --> 33:16.640
I was a bit distracted by my fiance trying to put porn in my laptop.

33:16.640 --> 33:21.640
we all spike I'd have to give that one it and probably a nine I'm a big fan of

33:21.640 --> 33:26.120
V&V I used to spin them at clubs years back following them for a long time I

33:26.120 --> 33:29.120
really like those guys spike do you have any live shows coming up coming up you

33:29.120 --> 33:32.600
want to plug I should have given you another opportunity on the podcast um I

33:32.600 --> 33:35.040
have something coming up but I don't want to talk about it until it's a good

33:35.040 --> 33:39.520
deal but probably in late may I'll be doing a few clubs come back to the show

33:39.520 --> 33:43.480
and give give it a plug and throw in something gaming related for us that's

33:43.480 --> 33:47.480
Well, I'd probably close the night with one of the Xanadu mixes from DDR.

33:47.480 --> 33:48.480
You're so badass.

33:48.480 --> 33:51.480
Because, well, the thing is, one of the shows would be at a gay club.

33:51.480 --> 33:52.480
Okay.

33:52.480 --> 33:53.480
So, Xanadu, bam.

33:53.480 --> 33:54.480
All right.

33:54.480 --> 33:55.480
Extover.

33:55.480 --> 33:56.480
V&V Nation, Chrome.

33:56.480 --> 34:04.480
I think, um, I will associate Kant with that song, because I saw it on Loki's computer.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.480
So, that deserves a pretty much a 9.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.480
I'm glad to hear it.

34:09.480 --> 34:10.480
Uh, Nelly!

34:10.480 --> 34:12.480
What did you think of V&V Nation with Chrome?

34:12.480 --> 34:16.480
Again, wasn't listening, so I'll give it a 10.

34:16.480 --> 34:17.480
Yay!

34:17.480 --> 34:18.480
Yay!

34:18.480 --> 34:22.480
I give that song like a 9, because I like VMV Nation, and that song makes me wanna dance

34:22.480 --> 34:25.680
like I'm in Silent Hill.

34:25.680 --> 34:26.680
Like the people do at the club.

34:26.680 --> 34:28.240
Like, have you ever been to the Goth Club?

34:28.240 --> 34:33.800
They dance like they're in Silent Hill, they're like, oooh, and the sirens are going off.

number three you guys have about 60 seconds to do it because we're about

35:34.340 --> 35:36.720
ready to pull the plug on this show because if you can believe it we've been

35:36.720 --> 35:39.840
on air for three and a half hours straight and we need air we need to go

35:39.840 --> 35:43.300
outside extra fur you came into the studio I'm sure you want to ruin the

35:43.300 --> 35:48.340
show somehow what do you want to say I didn't have anything I bought Harry

35:48.340 --> 35:52.980
Potter and Russian today why because it's pretty cool did you watch it yet I

35:52.980 --> 35:56.340
watched some of it now for those for those who don't know you're you're

35:56.340 --> 36:00.180
learning Russian mm-hmm now some folks figured this out because I posted a

36:00.180 --> 36:05.380
picture of the TV on our forums, over at ornithonshire.com, because I was showing my Xbox 360 with a

36:05.380 --> 36:10.140
Mario Kart background, and you can actually see the little tag on the TV that says the

36:10.140 --> 36:16.420
word television in Russian. And that's because you have scattered the apartment with index

36:16.420 --> 36:20.420
cards. They're only supposed to be there a week, if I remember right, but they're all

36:20.420 --> 36:25.500
still there now. I can take them off now, I know them now. No, it's fine, but how do

36:25.500 --> 36:31.800
you say television in Russian? Televizor. Oh, so he's learning! That's great. So tell

36:31.800 --> 36:36.900
us about, now what was your adventures today? My adventures today in Russian? I went to

36:36.900 --> 36:42.180
a Russian video store and it was like I was in another country and Nellie was with me

36:42.180 --> 36:48.540
and she's putting porn still on Loki's computer. I was going to give her gay porn websites,

36:48.540 --> 36:54.860
she didn't want to do it. Aww, do gay porn! I think I got the impression that Nellie thought

36:54.860 --> 37:06.420
the gay porn was porn was boring didn't you think that I like lesbians I told

37:06.420 --> 37:11.340
you boy God no you really lucked out in you no he's the funniest person in the

37:11.340 --> 37:14.620
world and the reason why is because earlier we watched the science the

37:14.620 --> 37:19.820
Silent Hill making of little I already told the story during oh man sorry you

37:19.820 --> 37:21.820
You can do it again. You can tell your way if you want.

37:21.820 --> 37:23.820
Oh no, she's just funny. She's just like,

37:23.820 --> 37:25.820
the pussy's scared of paper.

37:25.820 --> 37:27.820
That's so funny.

37:29.820 --> 37:31.820
You guys are so easily amused.

37:31.820 --> 37:33.820
It's not funny.

37:33.820 --> 37:35.820
It's funny. People should go to Nellie's

37:35.820 --> 37:37.820
MySpace too. Oh yeah.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.820
Nellie has the best MySpace

37:39.820 --> 37:41.820
I've ever seen. You don't even have Orange Lawn's

37:41.820 --> 37:43.820
Radio Friended though, do you? No, but

37:43.820 --> 37:45.820
I will today. Okay, well

37:45.820 --> 37:47.820
then how can they find Nellie on MySpace?

37:47.820 --> 37:52.540
know. What's your username? I don't know. Nellie. Is it just Nellie? Yes. So it's not

37:52.540 --> 37:55.420
like the rap. It's not going to bring up the rapper? No, it will bring up the rapper. What

37:55.420 --> 38:00.300
you got to do just it's kind of kind of like the six degrees of orange lounge or something.

38:00.300 --> 38:05.980
Go to orange lounge. Go to Rob's page or actually no because she's not in my top eight right now.

38:05.980 --> 38:09.180
She's in my top eight. She's in extraverse top eight though. Okay. So go to orange lounge and

38:09.180 --> 38:12.860
extraverse in the top eight and then Nellie. And your picture isn't really of you though.

38:12.860 --> 38:16.940
It's of you throwing babies, right? See, you gave it away. I was going to say. I'm sorry.

38:16.940 --> 38:23.940
It's a picture of my favorite sport, which is baby throwing. It's hilarious and nobody at my work thought it was funny because of bastards.

38:23.940 --> 38:27.940
Seriously, Nellie has the best MySpace page I've ever seen and you'll know why when you go there.

38:27.940 --> 38:28.940
She does.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.940
So go to the Orange Lodge Radio MySpace, then hop over to Exeter first.

38:31.940 --> 38:32.940
Make sure your sound's up.

38:32.940 --> 38:35.940
And then make sure your sound's up and hop over to Nellie's.

38:35.940 --> 38:37.940
Yeah. That's how they do it.

38:37.940 --> 38:38.940
And I helped.

38:41.940 --> 38:45.940
I need to count up cage match votes now, so somebody's gotta fill time.

38:45.940 --> 38:48.940
Matt, help us fill time here.

38:48.940 --> 38:52.940
Loki, think of a story that we haven't talked about yet tonight.

38:52.940 --> 38:55.940
Well, let's see here.

38:55.940 --> 38:59.940
Oh, I was going to say, there's another Grand Theft Auto Liberty City story.

38:59.940 --> 39:01.940
It's a PSP cheat device update.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.940
And they added now where you can adjust the water levels.

39:04.940 --> 39:07.940
So you can like flood cities and stuff and drive around the boat.

39:07.940 --> 39:09.940
Which is kind of fun.

39:09.940 --> 39:12.940
You know, and I'm surprised they should really put out tools like that.

39:12.940 --> 39:18.080
that because it is you know it adds more replayability to the game and I hope

39:18.080 --> 39:23.140
that they take you know a lesson from you know the users requests on like you

39:23.140 --> 39:26.180
know custom more customization for the multiplayer games and stuff like that

39:26.180 --> 39:32.940
because it really needs it other than that I was gonna say I hope I get my

39:32.940 --> 39:36.620
game informer soon because you know friggin a everyone gets theirs before me

39:36.620 --> 39:40.340
I haven't got my new issue of you know Xbox magazine it's already in newsstands

39:40.340 --> 39:45.120
So it's like what the hell is the point of subscribing to a magazine then if I'm getting it late?

39:45.120 --> 39:50.480
What are the demos on the new Xbox magazine is it with me buying the new Xbox magazines gonna have?

39:50.480 --> 39:53.800
What was the 360 demo on there? It was something good. It was I

39:54.600 --> 39:57.400
want to say the 360 version of

39:59.760 --> 40:02.620
Hitman blood money I want to say is on there I

40:03.160 --> 40:08.280
Can't be positive, but I thought that's what it was. I do know it has hit man on there as a demo

40:08.280 --> 40:14.280
I'm not sure if it's current gen or next gen, but, oh god, what else was on there?

40:14.280 --> 40:18.720
Just some really good demos though, but I want to say Hitman was on there.

40:18.720 --> 40:19.720
I can't remember though.

40:19.720 --> 40:22.680
I looked at it for like half a second, so.

40:22.680 --> 40:25.960
But Game Informer is always good, they're always, you know, the ones.

40:25.960 --> 40:31.320
It's really weird because their website, a lot of the news is like really sketchy.

40:31.320 --> 40:34.760
You know, some of it's, you know, accurate, most of it's not.

40:34.760 --> 40:37.720
But their magazine, it's, you know, pretty accurate.

40:37.720 --> 40:40.780
you know seems to be like they have a lot of exclusives and stuff it's like

40:40.780 --> 40:45.420
there's such a separation between the website and the actual magazine but I'm

40:45.420 --> 40:50.800
I don't know all right you ready to hear who won tonight's cage match sure all

40:50.800 --> 40:56.700
right it was a landslide vote tonight and although all three songs got a

40:56.700 --> 40:59.300
pretty fair amount of votes we had a lot of participation tonight thank you

40:59.300 --> 41:04.120
chatroom thank you for exercising your democratic right to vote I'm sorry I

41:04.120 --> 41:07.840
I will shove this microphone up your p-hole.

41:07.840 --> 41:13.000
The winning song tonight is X-Noise with the fusion.

41:16.520 --> 41:17.800
There you go.

41:17.800 --> 41:20.520
It was either this or a song that was by Rammstein.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.760
It sounded like it should be in Silent Hill.

41:23.760 --> 41:26.080
And SSJ100Matt would like to remind you,

41:26.080 --> 41:28.160
P. Diddy says, vote or die.

41:28.160 --> 41:28.660
Vote or die.

41:28.660 --> 41:30.280
Even though I don't think P. Diddy voted

41:30.280 --> 41:31.880
in some of the earlier elections.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.600
But hey, it's Diddy now.

41:33.600 --> 41:40.600
I'm sorry. Diddy what? Diddy what? Wait, it's just Diddy. He lost the P. Fucking artist.

41:41.840 --> 41:45.660
Someone knocked the P out of him. Stick with a name. Yeah, I know. Just pick a name and

41:45.660 --> 41:51.680
stick with it. You know, it's like, you know, they're not like, you know, different clothes

41:51.680 --> 41:56.080
or whatever, or Pokemon cards or something like that. Next to her, your audio is so jacked

41:56.080 --> 41:58.740
up tonight because I had to turn it up for Spike and now that you've got it, you're like

41:58.740 --> 42:03.660
That's exactly what you sound like.

42:03.660 --> 42:04.660
Crambor.

42:04.660 --> 42:06.340
Just take the mic away a little bit.

42:06.340 --> 42:07.340
Nobody needs me.

42:07.340 --> 42:09.340
Because Spike holds the microphone way down here.

42:09.340 --> 42:10.340
Nobody needs me.

42:10.340 --> 42:11.340
But you hold it like you're going to make love.

42:11.340 --> 42:12.340
Nobody needs me.

42:12.340 --> 42:13.340
There you go.

42:13.340 --> 42:14.340
Much better.

42:14.340 --> 42:15.340
Alright.

42:15.340 --> 42:17.700
Hobo, hobo, bot, or whatever.

42:17.700 --> 42:18.700
Winobot.

42:18.700 --> 42:19.700
Winobot.

42:19.700 --> 42:23.780
Alright, we'll allow a chance for Xdefer and Nelly to give their final thoughts since they

42:23.780 --> 42:26.900
didn't get a chance yet, and then we'll get into our cookie message of the day.

42:26.900 --> 42:28.900
Nellie, do you have a final thought?

42:28.900 --> 42:31.900
I learn new things about porn every day.

42:31.900 --> 42:32.900
Exta for your final thought.

42:32.900 --> 42:34.900
Cunts really do look like flowers.

42:34.900 --> 42:39.900
Alright, here it is kids, your fortune cookie message of the day.

43:09.900 --> 43:11.900
Oh

44:39.900 --> 44:48.980
And there it is, the Kotemu version of V, always a good time.

44:48.980 --> 44:52.480
That's it guys, we're now going to cut off the stream and take you back to Bomani and

44:52.480 --> 44:54.380
