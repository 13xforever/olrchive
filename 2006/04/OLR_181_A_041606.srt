00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,120
Tonight, April 16th, 2006, PlayStation 2 considers a price drop, Xbox Live plans another free

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,760
weekend, and a little story from some no-name website about Konami releases brings that

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:35,720
site a lot of attention this week hello everybody out there welcome to orange

4
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,920
lounge radio what gamers really want to know this is episode number 181 for this

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,680
April the 16th 2006 my name is Rob Roberts but you might know me as sky

6
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,480
joining me as always say hello to the lovely dark Sakura Jamie Summers hey how

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
How are you doing?

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,960
I always forget that you turn this thing off for me, so I will repeat, yo, what up?

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,960
How are you doing?

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Feeling better this week?

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,680
I am feeling better.

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
It was very weird.

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,240
I couldn't move.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
Last week?

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Last week.

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,160
I literally couldn't move, so I had to give blood.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,440
You made quite the turnaround because you were out rocking out last night, right?

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,740
I started feeling better by Monday, then Tuesday I felt a lot better, and Wednesday I was back

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,740
at work.

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,740
I even did my show on Tuesday, even though I said I wasn't gonna.

21
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,740
Did you hear me joking in the last podcast that you were playing hooky so you could stay home and play Kingdom Hearts 2?

22
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,740
You're not far off. No, I'm kidding. I actually did play a whole lot of Kingdom Hearts.

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,740
You know, it was kind of one of those things when I was sick when I was a kid.

24
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,740
My mom used to say, you're faking it so you can stay home and play video games.

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,740
It's like, no, but as long as I'm gonna be home, I might as well make some good use of my time.

26
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,740
People in the chatroom are saying I sound all stuffed up.

27
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,340
That's slightly true because you notice springtime, and I have allergies, but it went in fact

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:00,460
I was actually up until 4 30 a.m.. Because I went to see the most amazing live band ever

29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,460
Which was baby land I finally get to see baby land live

30
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:11,460
I'm so happy because all the other bands were like suck suck more suck, and then the Mormons and this Ninja Academy

31
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,100
8-bit was cool. We went outside

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,520
outside, um, for, uh, I, cause I went with a guano girl and she went to go, uh, have

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,080
a smoke and we were outside, while, while we were outside, this is video game related

34
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,800
by the way, I hear this bass line, cause they're sort of like kind of weird rap, you know,

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,660
group, but they're wearing hazmat suits too, but I hear this bass line that sounds familiar

36
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,740
and it turns out that it's the Zelda music as a bass line.

37
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,740
That's cool.

38
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,840
It was pretty cool, I mean, I wouldn't listen to 8-Bit all the time, but their music was

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
pretty cool.

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,200
you get them on the show at some point?

41
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,240
Maybe, but Babyland owned the stage.

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,840
I was bouncing and jumping, and we get out of there

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,480
at like 1.30.

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,880
I get home at 3.30, and of course I date my LiveJournal.

45
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,720
Like a true addict.

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,560
Like a true addict.

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,280
I have photos.

48
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,600
I will be sharing photos with our chat room tonight.

49
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,400
But it was probably the best time, I think,

50
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,800
I've ever had at a live show.

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,760
And so as a result, I'm kind of in grog mode today.

52
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,760
We went to our Easter brunch that Dan and a bunch of us

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,360
do every Easter.

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,980
Happy Easter to our listeners, by the way,

55
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,820
if you celebrate it.

56
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,120
If not, happy Sunday.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,720
Easter is a brunch day.

58
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,160
And over there is Loki, who's just waiting

59
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,000
to make a comment.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,640
Say hello to Tech Master Loki, also here.

61
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,980
Hi, I was gonna say Rabbit and Ham Day.

62
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,360
All right.

63
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,520
Anyway, usually we start off the show

64
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,500
doing a little bit of how was your gaming week,

65
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,860
But there's just one story that really caught our attention this week that we have to talk

66
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,380
about this first thing.

67
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,320
It's just such an interesting story that we have to kick off the show with this tonight.

68
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,940
And so we're going to head over to GameSpot because GameSpot ran an article this week

69
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,780
that I thought was very interesting.

70
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:05,780
Leaked Konami Schedule Reveals New DS Castlevania and PSP Silent Hill?

71
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:16,260
The source is self-styled online radio station, Orange Lounge Radio.

72
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,940
The official story, apparently Konami reps had not returned requests for comment on this.

73
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,460
Ooh, sounds pretty interesting.

74
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,500
I'm calling April Fools!

75
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,600
I think they're lying.

76
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,240
They're absolutely lying.

77
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,020
Let's see, what they heard, I'm not going to read the whole thing, if you want to check

78
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,580
it out you can go over to GameSpot.com.

79
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,540
Given that its primary focus is Konami's beat-matching series of games such as the popular games

80
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,740
Dance Dance Revolution and Beatmania, there's no question Orange Lounge Radio has its collective

81
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,620
eye on Konami.

82
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:55,440
So despite the site's low profile, people took notice this week when it crowed that

83
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,220
it had uncovered a slew of unannounced games and ship dates courtesy of a leaked list Konami

84
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,280
had sent to retailers.

85
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,060
So that's the first small correction we need to make, right?

86
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,040
Wasn't this a distributor thing or a retailer thing?

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
What was this?

88
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
It was both.

89
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Huh?

90
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,680
They basically send it to anybody who sells games, we'd probably get some sort of information

91
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
like this.

92
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Very interesting.

93
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
Blah, blah, blah.

94
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,040
They talk about the titles that this website decided to announce, DDR Supernova is going

95
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:28,080
to happen on September 13th, Dance Dance Revolution Universe on October 11th, DDR Ultra Mix 4

96
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,240
on November 14th, Castlevania Portrait of Ruin on November 15th.

97
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:43,020
By the way, that's Portrait of Ruin and then PSP Silent Hill Original Sin on October 18th.

98
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,100
Although very interesting because I seem to recall this website had a giant disclaimer

99
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:53,620
that said all these dates are subject to change as release dates always do.

100
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,540
And then of course two new Death Junior games, but people don't seem to care as much about

101
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,540
those.

102
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,820
And then I thought this was interesting too.

103
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,400
This list also promises a potentially very lucrative tie-in for Konami.

104
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,500
According to Orange Launch Radio, the list has Karaoke Revolution American Idol arriving

105
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,340
in stores on November 15th.

106
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,500
If true, the game would be the second one based on the mega-popular television series

107
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,220
after Codemaster's dismally-reviewed 2003 game.

108
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,400
Never mind that Konami already announced back in October that they were going to do the

109
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,020
American Idol franchise, I know because we covered it on this program, but you know,

110
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,020
it still is a rumor.

111
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,020
It's a dirty rumor.

112
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,020
Who actually listens to us?

113
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,020
I forgot. Nobody knows of Orange Lawn's Radio. They've been low-key for the past few years.

114
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:44,020
Alright. No, seriously, I'm picking on these guys over at GameSpot, but I think, actually, this is one of the more well-written articles on the whole thing.

115
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,020
I wonder what that hunk of plastic on my mantle is.

116
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,020
What?

117
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,020
The podcast award.

118
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:55,020
Oh, oh yeah, yeah. Never mind the podcast award. Never mind that we've actually been doing this for the past, you know, four years almost.

119
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,020
Next month it'll have been four years that we've been doing Orange Lawn's Radio.

120
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,020
But somehow, that whole time, we've managed to be low-key.

121
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,020
So our long-time fans, you know, you've been a part of something for a long time.

122
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,020
I've always been low-key.

123
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,020
Yeah, you've always been low-key.

124
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,020
You know, I'm short, so I'm pretty low to the ground.

125
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,020
No, we don't have delusions of grandeur.

126
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,020
We know that this site has always been an underground, independent thing.

127
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,020
So we're saying this very tongue-in-cheek about this whole underground thing.

128
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,020
We know that, you know, we got a lot of attention this week.

129
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,020
But the question is, did we really deserve it?

130
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,020
I mean, were any of these titles really a surprise to anybody?

131
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,020
No.

132
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,020
I mean, Castlevania was such a kick-ass game on the DS.

133
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,020
Of course there was going to be another DS game coming.

134
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,020
The Silent Hill remake has been running...

135
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,020
That was a rumor. Like, we covered that three weeks ago.

136
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,020
They talked about, well, they were going to make, other than, you know,

137
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,020
the Silent Hill experience, they were going to be doing a PSP game anyway.

138
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,020
So it's like, okay.

139
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,200
Okay, and there was a speculation given from some other commentary about

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,400
them remaking based on the movie

141
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,300
Remaking the first game based on the movie and of course DDR is going to have home release

142
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,420
They're not gonna release it at home. I'm sorry never mind the fact that when they were advertising supernova

143
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,300
They said that it's gonna have some connectivity to home versions

144
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,980
Duh, I mean obviously there's got to be a new home version coming out, so I don't know

145
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,980
Do we really deserve all this notoriety?

146
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,100
Why do people care so much about this story?

147
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,460
Because people like release dates.

148
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,100
Even though release dates are always subject to change.

149
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,940
Exactly, they're always subject to change.

150
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,300
So by the time we get down to it, well, to be honest, the DDR releases I'm not too surprised

151
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,500
on because they release DDR about the same time every year.

152
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,580
You get the Xbox version sometime in November, usually the first half, and the PS2 version

153
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,060
sometime in september

154
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,000
so it's it's the same time every year

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,820
well i found the whole fall out over the story very fascinating i think the part

156
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,580
that fascinated me most wasn't the notoriety itself because i understand

157
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,580
people care about silent hill in castlevania

158
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,460
and ddr they've got all three of them have very rabid fan bases but what

159
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,940
surprised me

160
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,740
was the reaction on the internet out there to these stories it's really funny

161
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,680
because when ddr freaked bamani style those sites picked up the story

162
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,300
it was reported as fact

163
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,660
but when other sites bigger name sites pick this up it was reported as

164
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,340
rumor which I thought was very very interesting and you bring up a good

165
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:24,700
point

166
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,260
are people just upset that we beat them to it? I don't know

167
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,700
but now remind us Loki where did this come from it's just a list that goes out

168
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,060
this

169
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,100
came in okay this information got sent to our buyer

170
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,660
the person that you know maintains our item database

171
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,780
this was sent to us and entered into our item database

172
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,860
I merely get a report every now and then when

173
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,020
they change dates. It's basically a date change report

174
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:57,260
and I notice Bomberman Act Zero, Xbox 360 and PSP. I'm like, hey, I didn't know that was on the PSP.

175
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,580
So I really quickly, I'm like, oh wait, Konami's putting that out? I didn't know that.

176
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,080
So I just, you know, real quickly looked in there and I'm like, okay, let's see what

177
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,220
we got for the rest of the year here. All of a sudden I see all of Konami's games on there. I'm like,

178
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,260
well, hey, this is interesting. Usually though, when I see stuff like this, for example, I've been

179
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,100
saying karaoke revolution country. We saw this before

180
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,060
um, you know, Konami gamers day and usually I don't

181
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,460
try to go out and post this stuff because I don't really find the announcement

182
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,580
of release dates that important. For example, there's games like

183
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,140
commando strike force. It's been delayed by a whole friggin year.

184
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,640
This game was slated for 2004 and

185
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,700
or 2005 and it finally came out, you know, just last week or so.

186
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,420
So, I don't know, release dates to me are not really a big deal, but

187
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,740
I just thought it was interesting because there's a lot of these games that we knew

188
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,380
were coming out anyways

189
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,140
and now that we had dates, it's kinda making it more official. Also kinda gives you an

190
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,580
idea what they're gonna be showing at

191
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,100
E3 this year. Wait, hold on, I thought you were gonna say some more stuff. Hold that

192
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,940
thought for a minute though.

193
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,340
No. Because, okay, here's the interesting thing because

194
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,780
what I thought was interesting about the reaction is that people didn't believe

195
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,020
it when it was on our site,

196
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:14,100
But, when somebody else, one of the big name sites reported it, then it was validated.

197
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,820
It was true.

198
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,120
Guess what guys?

199
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,260
Those big sites all copied from our list and here's the proof.

200
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,860
The proof is that when these websites ran a story that said Konami leaked information

201
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,580
or whatever, they listed the same dates we did.

202
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,580
But what we didn't tell you was, Loki only posted the games he thought you'd want to

203
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,580
know about, right?

204
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
Exactly.

205
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,260
A website that would have found this about Konami games would have picked up the other

206
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,100
Lower name titles that maybe we didn't think you originally wanted to know about but now after all this fear

207
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,820
We we guess you do want to know about yeah, so Loki. What are some other?

208
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,340
Konami games that were on this list

209
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,140
for example

210
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,680
Rengoku 2 you know it's really sad as I actually played Rengoku last e3

211
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,620
I actually brought it with me on my PSP, and I love this game except

212
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,660
But it was really boring.

213
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,020
But for whatever reason, Rengoku 2 is coming out on July 12th, that's what it's slated

214
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,020
for right now.

215
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,020
About the same time I...

216
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,820
No, actually I think Rengoku came out later than that last year.

217
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
Anyways.

218
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,940
Yeah, okay game I guess.

219
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,980
God damn screensaver.

220
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,860
I fucking hate these stupid...

221
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,020
That's why you turn them off.

222
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,460
But I like the fishies.

223
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,420
Anyways, on top of that, we've also got...

224
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,100
Let's see here, if you're a Yu-Gi-Oh fan there's going to be lots of stuff for you. You got

225
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:42,820
Yu-Gi-Oh GX Tag Force coming out on the PSP, that's on November 15th. Xialin Showdown,

226
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,260
which is apparently based on some anime show that's I think on the WB or whatever, coming

227
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:57,140
out on Playstation 2, Xbox, PSP, and I think DS. And that one's coming out on November

228
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:05,620
15th. Um, online chess kingdoms, PSP. I am so looking forward to that! Uh, also November

229
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:12,620
15th. Um. Nerd. Winx Club quest for codex. We are the Winx, we are the Winx. God, I hate

230
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,940
the Winx. That was last year's E3 for me, standing in Konami's booth jamming to that

231
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:22,100
Winx song. That you know that song? Frightens me? It's stuck in my head from last year's

232
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,300
C3 being at that booth. It's an infectious song, don't ask me.

233
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,660
Yeah, well anyways, Winx Club Quest for Codex, that's going to be coming out, looks like

234
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:36,860
October 25th, along with Steel Horizon on the PSP, which I believe is a naval warfare

235
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,660
game. Then there's a Marvel trading card game, to be honest I don't...

236
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,140
Is this all Konami? It's all Konami.

237
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,580
Dang. Marvel trading card games coming out on the

238
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:50,500
PSP, and I want to say the DS, so that should be interesting. I guess they're trying to,

239
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:56,260
You know, I guess since Yu-Gi-Oh is popular, we're trying some other stuff here.

240
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,260
And I want to say, I think, you know, Gradius Collections coming out next month, June 14th,

241
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:09,940
but I knew that for a while, Demon Chaos coming out next month, Lunar Knights Vampire Hunt

242
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,700
is going to be coming out November 15th.

243
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,300
And I think that's about it.

244
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,660
Wake me up when we get a Goemon game.

245
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:24,540
Now what I think is interesting about this is that if anybody from Konami is listening

246
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,860
and is ticked off about this, please don't be.

247
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,100
We're just repeating information that's already been put out there into the retailers

248
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,520
and we figure well since retailers know about this, maybe the gamers want to know about

249
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
this too.

250
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,860
It's the same thing like when other websites post a goddamn list from GameStop.

251
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,560
Those are internal lists that they actually scan in and throw online, so I don't feel

252
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,900
too bad to be honest.

253
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,620
And to lessen the blow a little bit, do you have anything from another game company that

254
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,620
people might want to know about?

255
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,620
Hell yeah, we do.

256
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,620
Anyways, no.

257
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,180
Let's take a look-see here, some stuff maybe later on this year.

258
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:06,580
For example, there was some games, actually they announced Open Season I think this week

259
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,600
as well, that was one of the ones that's going to be based on I think a DreamWorks movie

260
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,580
or something like that, some animated movie about animals getting back at hunters or something.

261
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,940
But that's coming out in the fall.

262
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,660
I do have, what was it, oh what was a really cool one here.

263
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,860
Oh here's one.

264
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,860
Nintendo DS.

265
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,420
SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighter.

266
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,180
It's going to be coming out on, looks like October 2nd.

267
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,700
Hey, that's awesome.

268
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,340
Because I have that on Neo Geo pocket color five years ago.

269
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,740
Can I see the big list here?

270
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,140
Because I remember there were some games on here I thought were very very interesting.

271
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:50,040
I remember seeing distinctly when I looked at this Disgaea 2, I want to say that was

272
00:15:50,040 --> 00:16:00,040
August, let's see PS2, Disgaea 2, August 30th, I had a guy that used to buy thousands of

273
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,100
these things, Cartoon Network Racing, October 18th, hey there's Dance Factory, that game's

274
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,360
been delayed forever, yeah it sucked, a game based on the movie Cars, is that what that

275
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,440
is on June 7th there um yeah that that's no what was that Naruto I bet a lot of

276
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,000
our listeners that like anime one about that they actually are bringing out the

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,960
because I I've known about this for a little while they're bringing out one of

278
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:29,320
the last Naruto games Naruto ultimate ninja that's coming out June 21st what

279
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,760
was a really cool funny one I saw here and the people might not know about you

280
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,040
ps2 Yakuza is coming out September 13th I know that was one that was pretty cool

281
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,760
I'm trying to think of some really cool stuff.

282
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,760
What's coming out way later in the year there?

283
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,280
I wish this was in order here.

284
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,120
Oh, there's a bunch of 360 games.

285
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,800
Dead Rising, I think the date's wrong on that though.

286
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,440
I think it got postponed, we haven't updated it yet.

287
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,920
Over-G Fighters, that looks kind of cool.

288
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,000
Over-G Fighters is June 8th there?

289
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,040
Yeah, June 8th, that's...

290
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,520
Splinter Cell, Double Agent?

291
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
I remember.

292
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,220
Yeah, they got postponed a while back because they didn't think there was enough systems

293
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
out there.

294
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:17,160
Snoopy vs. the Red Baron going on October, or not October, August 16th.

295
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,960
We covered that one.

296
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Yeah, I know.

297
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,720
Alright, so there you have it.

298
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,080
There's, and this stuff is all, you know, subject to change, I mean, a lot of stuff

299
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:32,160
they announce way in advance and gets pushed back and back and back and back and, yeah.

300
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,440
But I don't know, there's some good stuff.

301
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:46,240
Mega Man ZX coming out September 13th on the Game Boy Advance.

302
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,800
So yeah, lots of exciting stuff.

303
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:55,680
More of course coming from E3, granted we might see stuff at E3 that wasn't on the Konami

304
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
list.

305
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
Oh, absolutely.

306
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
I'm sure there will be.

307
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,880
For example, we don't have any Revolution or

308
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,680
PS3 titles in here yet. And there was nothing on a Metal Gear 4, right?

309
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,880
Which, you know, we know Konami's planning but they don't have a date for it yet

310
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,360
obviously. Exactly. So

311
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,680
lots of stuff coming and, you know,

312
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,160
one, I'll just keep an eye out on these dates, you know, if we see anything good

313
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,680
I'll definitely

314
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,600
you know, keep guys up to date on this stuff. Alright, sounds great.

315
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,100
Our Skype line is open if anyone wants to give us a call.

316
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,780
most specifically about this topic here is what we want you guys's feedback on

317
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,660
kinda what do you think about this whole

318
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,060
news story do you think we're full of crap

319
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,540
uh... which i hope by this point you don't but if you do it and say so will

320
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,340
you know offer our witty retorts

321
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,200
uh... do you think that did we really three

322
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,820
i hope i don't think we don't think we don't like free three to be honest if

323
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,460
anything this

324
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,060
who out there i mean other than probably a size actually no goes the e three

325
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,860
looking

326
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,100
to see what Konami is putting out. I mean I know everybody's interested in all the companies

327
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,380
and stuff, but I mean the big focus this year is going to be PS3 Revolution. I think the

328
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:11,300
fact that we put out the dates, maybe if anything, kind of helped. I don't know. It's only two

329
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,220
weeks away. I mean it's like, you know, it's not a huge spoiler.

330
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:22,200
Alright, so no calls coming out on the Skype line right now, but our chat room is kind

331
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,400
of a buzz here over at www.orangelandtrady.com, click on chat.

332
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:36,280
We have Rama says Naruto GameCube sucks, Naruto PS2 owns, or I should say pwns so to speak.

333
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,360
Dark Knight wants to know, oh my god they are going to port the Neo Geo Pocket game,

334
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,280
I wonder if that's in reference to the Capcom SNK card game there.

335
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:50,940
Naruto 2 is coming out on GameCube October 18th, oh it should be fun.

336
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:56,760
So you guys, if you guys want to comment on there, www.orangelaungeradio.com and click

337
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
on chat.

338
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,380
Here's one I was interested in.

339
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,380
September 13th, only a couple days after my birthday, Power Stone Collection for the PSP.

340
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,060
Here's another thing you might not have known.

341
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:11,140
Test Drive Unlimited, you know the 360 games, actually coming out on the current gen stuff

342
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,140
as well.

343
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,820
They're reporting it to PSP, PS2, Xbox.

344
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,820
Awesome.

345
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,700
Alright, sounds pretty good.

346
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,380
All right, well since it looks like people are being shy in our chat room right now

347
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,580
I want not want to give us a call

348
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,300
We'll we'll open up skype line a little later for other topics if you guys want to call in and talk about that

349
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,920
But for now, we'll go ahead and move on and talk about our gaming week how we usually start off the show

350
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,360
Dark Sakura, what have you been playing this week Kingdom Hearts and lots of it. Oh

351
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,420
My god, I played just like I was so in a hurry to get past all the rocks

352
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,860
Roxas crap that when I did I just was her like okay that's a relief and then

353
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:59,780
I played like for hours and I got past the space paranoid part earlier in the

354
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,620
week I waited on that said that Dan could see it because he he's also a big

355
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:09,580
Tron fan and then I did the thousand heartless battle today I hear that's a

356
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,980
fun part of the game it actually is but it's a pain in the ass cuz what's his

357
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:20,260
face the guitar boy he's he's a pain in the ass to beat but yeah I had a I've

358
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,700
been playing a lot of that and not really much else just because you know

359
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,860
it puts me back in couch potato mode and I played like a little bit of Ragnarok

360
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:34,380
was like I don't really feel like trying to get to level 50 today so that's

361
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,060
really been about all I've been playing is lots and lots and lots and lots and

362
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,660
lots and lots of Kingdom Hearts all right I hear it's I hear it's a very

363
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,340
time consuming game.

364
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,380
I haven't touched my copy in a week, I feel bad, but I need to get back into that because

365
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,640
it was a really fun game.

366
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,980
You're playing that dirty Final Fantasy 11.

367
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,180
I have been playing that dirty Final Fantasy 11.

368
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,140
Since Dark Soccer threw it over to me, I'll talk about my game of the week.

369
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,440
I've been playing that dirty, dirty Final Fantasy 11 in preparation for the Xbox version

370
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,780
and the new expansion that's coming out this week.

371
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,800
Pretty excited about that.

372
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,540
I did switch servers a while ago, trying out a new server.

373
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,880
I'm playing on seraph is the server I'm playing on and I am not sky on seraph

374
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,600
I picked a different name because you know, I just wanted I wanted some anonymity on playing Final Fantasy 11

375
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,640
But there is a sky on there, but she's it's a she and it's not me

376
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,200
I have a different name on there

377
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,880
But I ran into a lot of really nice people on that server and and some people that are helping me level my way to

378
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,440
Level 30 so I can get some of those advanced jobs because I kind of want to be a puppet master in Final Fantasy 11

379
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,080
That'll rock as far as other games. I've been playing a whole lot of new stuff

380
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,080
I ordered Beatmania 2DX night style

381
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,280
Like last week and I finally got it this week

382
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,160
so I've been playing a little bit of that beat mania's release here in the USA really got me back into playing that and

383
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,660
Outside of that. I also decided to download mutant storm reloaded the game on xbox live arcade after seeing it at Loki's house the other day and

384
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:05,680
It's it's interesting because it's very similar geometry wars, but it's not it's like the stages aren't all that same square

385
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,580
and it's it's a pretty game but not in the same way it's it's very sci-fi

386
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,560
looking and like you know pulsing cells and all that kind of look and it's

387
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:21,600
pretty fun I I think geometry wars is a little more fast-paced and really you

388
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,320
have to be a lot quicker the mutant storm but mutant storm is a fun game but

389
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,960
what I think kind of hurts mutant storm is that geometry war is only five bucks

390
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,800
mutant storm is all is ten bucks so you know there you have it however mutant

391
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,540
Storm to give it a little credit. It does have some additional modes, it has a two-player

392
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,800
mode which Geometry Wars doesn't, but you can't do it on Xbox Live, so keep that in

393
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:49,360
mind. And so it's got a little bit more to it, but I don't know if it's $5 worth when

394
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,160
you consider that such a great game like Geometry Wars is only $5. And that pretty much does

395
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,540
it for my gaming week. I mean Final Fantasy XI eats up a lot of my time. I have other

396
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,600
games that I'm waiting to try, like Spike brought some games that he wanted me to try

397
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,160
out and I got a copy of Oblivion but for the computer and I want to be checking

398
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,560
that out pretty soon as well so one of my friends let me borrow his copy of

399
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,600
Oblivion so I'll be good I wanted to add something what's that I really really

400
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,480
hate the little mermaid levels I heard the little mermaid levels are I hope

401
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,640
this is a spoiler but I heard they're a little bit beat matching yeah it's like

402
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,600
you have to hit the button on the fourth beat you know to trigger whatever but

403
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,420
The first one sucks, and then I went back and listened to it again in Japanese and the Japanese version sucks, too

404
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,600
There's only like two good songs in the whole undersea part

405
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:49,800
Mini me 283 says I love that penny arcade comic about Kingdom Hearts 2. I didn't I unfortunately didn't see that one

406
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,560
I was hoping maybe you'd seen it. Yes. I have it's Winnie the Pooh merging with Sephiroth. Oh wait

407
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,840
I didn't see that I did yeah, I did see that. Oh, it's funny

408
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,520
So Sepiros in this one too?

409
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,880
Yeah and he's not what's-his-face anymore.

410
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,400
Lance Bass from NSYNC? Yeah, but

411
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,000
whoever is Aerith sounds like she's stoned.

412
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,720
Uh, Manus Avari from American Beauty. She sucks. I don't like her in that.

413
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,000
And she's gonna be her in Advent Children. I would have rather had Mandy Moore in

414
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,880
that saying something.

415
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,560
But she's like, oh, I'm on drugs.

416
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Want to get high?

417
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Loki, what have you been playing this week?

418
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,560
Well, I've been playing Mutant Storm Reloaded. I played that last night.

419
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,560
And that was fun.

420
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
I'm getting tangled here.

421
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,560
And I was also playing more Oblivion.

422
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
And that's really cool.

423
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,560
And I'm cheating. That's even better.

424
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
I did an item dupe.

425
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,560
So I have all the Uber stuff now.

426
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:58,880
stuff now. It was kind of neat though, I got this really magic enhanced katana and I took

427
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,400
off someone's head with it and it was cool. I tried to kill a horse and people didn't

428
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:12,400
like that very much. But, what else? I played Realm of Roses XX and...

429
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,440
I had been playing with the photo taking mode?

430
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,840
No, I did create a character though and it looked pretty cool.

431
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,000
You don't get much to start off with, but it's really neat how they do the different...

432
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,360
how customizable it is. I did make a character that looked like

433
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,120
Ms. Swan from Mad TV. I was gonna say you were telling me about Ms. Swan. I wish you could have seen this.

434
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,040
That was hilarious.

435
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,080
Actually, the Ms. Swan character,

436
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,040
all you have to do is basically take the default character that they give you and

437
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,680
just make her fat and she looks like Ms. Swan.

438
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,680
so I don't know and then

439
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,300
what else did I do I actually apparently

440
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,920
I played Mario Kart GP I can't tell you anything about it

441
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,320
because I don't remember yes Loki's bachelor party was last night and as

442
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,360
part of it he got to go to golf land to play some drunken miniature golf and some

443
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,040
drunken Mario Kart I was there

444
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,920
I filmed it and I think it's going to be going up on the website at some point or

445
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,880
maybe the MySpace or something I don't know

446
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,320
We'll have to put it somewhere on one of those sites so we still need more people on our myspace

447
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,640
So maybe we ought to put it over there. We'll put it on both put it on YouTube. It's

448
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,760
The whole

449
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,580
Drunken a-hole from no-name site plays Mario Kart drunk

450
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,520
It was great. I think the best part was you know how Mario Kart arcade will take your picture

451
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:44,000
Before you start playing the picture that you did was so friggin hilarious. I can't even describe it

452
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,620
you guys are gonna have to wait for the video it's great I'm converting the

453
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:54,020
video tonight Jeremy Todd one says put it on olrpsp.com so yeah we're definitely

454
00:27:54,020 --> 00:28:00,680
going to be doing that yeah the 23rd magus says we need a drunk show I hate

455
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,680
to tell you but probably not gonna happen for a little while gonna be

456
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,140
somewhere during our next three-day weekend yeah oh yeah next the next

457
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,420
three-day weekend is Memorial Day weekend at Fauna me yeah we're doing the

458
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:15,620
panels at Fauna Mae so we'd love to meet some of our listeners. Yeah, and like like

459
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,620
the last really bad drunk show I did get very sick. There will probably be some

460
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,900
drinking at E3 Outpost because I know we're supposed to be doing that with the

461
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,320
folks over at AllGames.com. They've got the little E3Outpost.com and

462
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,660
they're supposed to have a bar so that might be a good time. That makes me a

463
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:39,220
happy bunny. Yes, yeah, we'll see. The whole thing is, I don't know, last night was

464
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:44,860
pretty bad I mean it was really bad I mean it's always your bachelor party you

465
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,180
were supposed to I don't remember half of it I guess that's supposed to happen

466
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:54,580
but luckily even though I can't remember it we do have it on video and I'm not

467
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,660
sure I don't think obviously I want to put the the Mario Kart thing because I

468
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,860
watched that today for the first time and I laughed my ass off I thought it

469
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:08,420
was hilarious the face that I made was great oh you're so funny I know that was

470
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,620
yelling at the volcano because it could

471
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,980
yeah mil foolily says and I totally

472
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,100
butchered that name sorry says that we

473
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,780
should put it on wiki quote

474
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,460
unfortunately I think Matt's wiki quote

475
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,020
got VFD'd today I don't think it's

476
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,420
there anymore so sadness but no more

477
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,700
wiki quote for us now if somebody wanted

478
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,340
to create one under orange lounge radio

479
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,620
they might be able to get away with it

480
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,140
this time I don't know we'll see

481
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,940
yeah we're we're too busy converting

482
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,940
videos to our ourselves on wiki but we

483
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,180
We know you guys love the wiki.

484
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:46,780
Then of course, I did play more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories, so it's all good.

485
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,780
Awesome.

486
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,280
Alright, let's get into some news from a bunch of no-name websites out there that we want

487
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
to share with you guys.

488
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
No, I'm kidding.

489
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,620
I'm totally kidding.

490
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,420
And I thought we'd start it off with this story tonight because I think this is very

491
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,900
interesting and it's kind of a follow-up to this whole fallout that we were talking about

492
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
earlier.

493
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,360
as people reacted to our news as, who are these guys?

494
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,540
This story comes from gamedaily.com.

495
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:21,540
No one watches online video game TV and basically it's this report that was done by Forrester

496
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:26,740
Research and the report found that 25% of online households have expressed interest

497
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:33,780
in podcasting but only 2% have experimented with audio downloads and only 1% of households

498
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,180
actually got a podcast onto a player.

499
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:43,400
So podcasting is still kind of a very niche thing and they're saying that, you know, when

500
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:49,500
you consider that PodNova has 55,000 different podcasts available out there, it's still not

501
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,720
really catching on.

502
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,240
I still say it's too new.

503
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,060
I realize podcasting, you know, it's a very trendy thing in the nerd culture right now.

504
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,100
I think it's still going to be a little while before we see this catch on.

505
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:07,420
I think video casting, honestly, is where it's at and I'd love to do a video thing someday,

506
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:12,140
but we have our own internal things to work out first before we do that, but I think until

507
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,900
it gets to the video level, that's when it's going to really be able to compete with cable

508
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:20,340
and satellite and all that good stuff, and it's starting to happen to some extent, but

509
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:25,260
even the video casts that are available out there, most of them, about half of them, are

510
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,780
pretty much shows or forms of shows that you can already find out there on the TV, so I

511
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,700
think that's probably why this hasn't really caught on just yet so something

512
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,180
to think about their online video game TV do you guys listen to any other

513
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:44,260
podcast besides this one maybe that's our have time yeah I even listen to this

514
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,780
one maybe that's part of it I listen to a couple but I wish I could listen to

515
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,500
more but I don't like listening to my own voice so I don't listen to our

516
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:56,300
podcast okay it's just I've just always been like it is a little weird hey no

517
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,460
no not your voice I'm saying it's a little weird to hear yourself back well

518
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:05,020
you know you're way too but no no uh I just kind of get weirded out by that but

519
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:12,660
I just never have any time you know I've downloaded a few podcasts from you know

520
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:17,300
for people I've actually met like at the podcast Awards mm-hmm and I've listened

521
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,500
to a few others you know I try to check out the ones that are out there but I

522
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:26,660
can't really dedicate any real time to it since I'm in school we have some

523
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,540
comments in the chatroom or in the loungeradio.com, click on chat.

524
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,700
VxjasonXV says, video casting is for porn.

525
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,020
Gives a little salute, a mode icon, yeah, there you go.

526
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,420
Rama says, bring back the OLR webcam.

527
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,980
Maybe, well, maybe, I don't know, we'll see.

528
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,060
And some other folks in chat are talking about some of the other shows that they

529
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,540
listen to.

530
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:51,100
Some folks that listen to shows over at allgames.com or

531
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,660
shows that are affiliated with all games, such as Video Game Show.

532
00:32:54,660 --> 00:33:01,900
Some folks saying they listen to Dignation, DreamStation CC, I know they sent us something

533
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,960
a while ago, we played around Christmas time.

534
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,140
So very interesting.

535
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,560
I think Overnight Scape was one of the ones I was listening to off and on, because I met

536
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,360
the guy who runs it.

537
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,900
He interviewed me at the podcast.

538
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,980
I remember, I actually heard that, it was pretty cool.

539
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,340
Alright, and you had an interview on the All Games podcast, didn't you, on Friday?

540
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,740
Yeah, All Games Interactive.

541
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,740
Yeah.

542
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,740
Good time?

543
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,740
Sure.

544
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,220
Sure. I was like in such a

545
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,260
rush that day. I don't remember what I was doing.

546
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,820
I don't know. That's alright.

547
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,020
Let's move on to another story. Let's go over to

548
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,300
Dark Sakura. Got any news on the

549
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,180
classic gaming consoles? I have something about the PS2.

550
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:49,580
Classic enough. It's gonna be classic pretty soon. Seriously, it's alright.

551
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,620
I can't believe I've had my Japanese PS2 for like

552
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,900
ever. I have a first model one and it still works.

553
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,180
That's, a lot of people... How's that for defeating the odds? Mine still works too, but I don't have a

554
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,700
first

555
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,740
gen. I got mine a couple years after it was out. I bought my Japanese PlayStation 2

556
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,180
pretty much just for Beatmania.

557
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,340
I picked up a couple other games, but pretty much that's the only one that gets

558
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,820
played on it.

559
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,660
Well, there's actually reporting from CNN Money,

560
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,700
from Chris Morris at CNN Money, stating

561
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,140
that the PlayStation 2's price is going to drop.

562
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,380
Um, right now it's at $149,

563
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,980
um, but now that the Xbox 360 is really

564
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,020
staying there, um, it looks like, uh,

565
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:37,420
they're gonna be dropping the price by about 20 bucks. Very cool. So,

566
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,660
you know, in light of all these new systems coming out, they're gonna be a little more

567
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,940
expensive. I think it's,

568
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,180
you know, formulaic almost that these old consoles drop in price a little bit.

569
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:50,900
So, some folks who still don't have a PS2 will be very happy. It's $20 though. I mean,

570
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,700
if they really wanted to make it, they've already made back their money

571
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,300
they should drop that thing to 99 and clear them out.

572
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,940
They just sell a hell of a lot of games that way. I heard a rumor that they're

573
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,800
actually talking to

574
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,260
99 later. Maybe 99 will come at Christmas when PS3 is already out.

575
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,060
I mean who out there is going, damn I'd buy that PS2

576
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:15,740
if it were only twenty dollars cheaper. Every dollar counts though if you're trying to

577
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,060
budget out. You know not everybody is

578
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,420
in the games enough to wanna buy a GameCube,

579
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,500
a PlayStation 2, and an Xbox. Never mind the DS, the PSP, and all that other stuff

580
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,060
too. You know, not everybody is

581
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,380
sick like we are and buys all those systems. Not everybody can afford it.

582
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,940
I mean, I budget for those types of expenses but, you know,

583
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,740
not everybody can do that. So, every

584
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,060
every penny counts. A penny saved is a penny earned?

585
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,320
I don't know, whatever. A penny saved is

586
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,520
a penny that you already earned a penny set aside

587
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,080
a dollar saved is when you should send to me it

588
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,240
that's a phrase that I've never been able to to get behind

589
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,800
just because a penny saved is a penny earned but you've already earned it

590
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,120
so you didn't earn it twice what's up with that pennies aren't worth anything

591
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,720
anyway

592
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,880
could you get behind the dollar saved as a dollar you should send to

593
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,360
orange launch radio I already says in my intro to pump up the volume to send me a

594
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,960
dollar

595
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,960
Two people have sent me a dollar.

596
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
For real? I didn't know that.

597
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Two people have mailed me a dollar bill.

598
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Where's the cut?

599
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
Where's our cut?

600
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,960
It was invested into the show to give me beer.

601
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Oh, okay. Fair enough.

602
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,960
That increases my entertainment value.

603
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
Loki, for those folks...

604
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,960
That bottle of fat tire that's in my fridge.

605
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Loki, for those folks who are ready to graduate to the Playstation 3

606
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,960
and can't freaking wait for it, what's the latest on Playstation 3?

607
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,880
Well, you'll get to play it at E3 this year, which is awesome.

608
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,600
Except you gotta wait in line.

609
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
A long line.

610
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,240
A very, very, very, very, very, very long line.

611
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,640
So basically, yeah it will be there, but it's gonna be pretty much like the PSP was when

612
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,940
they first showed that a couple years ago.

613
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,940
Long line.

614
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,320
You know, Sony and Nintendo love to do the, you know, long line to play something.

615
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,680
I'm sure this year Nintendo's gonna have a long line to play The Revolution.

616
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,520
a big surprise you know hopefully there will be some actual games there it gives

617
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,320
it that exclusive club feeling to it in a way you know like yeah I got to see

618
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,560
the ps3 83 and you didn't you know one of those things like I didn't I don't

619
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,360
wait in line for Zelda last year I know I'm crazy but I I just felt my three

620
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,920
hours I was waiting I could have waited in line to see Zelda or I could have

621
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,520
actually taken time to really look at some of the things in Kenshi a hall and

622
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,840
there's some pretty you know good gems down there every year so I'm saying if

623
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,400
rumor or fact on this PS3 thing? I guess we don't really know until E3, right?

624
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,720
I'm gonna say probably fact, because it makes perfect sense.

625
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,920
I mean, look at last year, they even went a step further at Microsoft's booth and they

626
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,680
said,

627
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,840
hey, you gotta be pressed in order to play the 360,

628
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:00,400
bitch. So just because you deem it fact, then it must be fact, right?

629
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,040
I'm speculating. I'm pulling that completely out of my ass.

630
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,520
You might remember a classic video game. We're jumping from classic to new, but

631
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,240
This is classic out of this world. You remember this game out of this world. It was released in 1991

632
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,040
I want to say it came out on the Sega Genesis was one of the systems. It was on this was a game

633
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,520
I never really got into but I know it has a really cult following to the game and

634
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,280
It was a really nice-looking game and used 3d polygon like really before it was because I mean this was 91

635
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,760
And we didn't really have PlayStation and things until super Nintendo baby. Yeah, super Nintendo had it too

636
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:43,840
Well, a brand new version of this was released, and you can get this at www.AnotherWorld.fr.

637
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,320
By the way, Another World is what they called this game outside the US, so if you are one

638
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,200
of our outside the United States listeners, you know this game as Another World.

639
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,960
So check out www.AnotherWorld.fr, you can download a shareware demo and unlock it for

640
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,960
only 7 euros.

641
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,660
It's only about $8.50 in US dollars, so check it out.

642
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:06,400
If you're a fan of this game, you still love this game, it's a high resolution version,

643
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,220
and the screenshot that I see here on this site, it makes it look very pretty, so definitely

644
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,480
worth checking out if you have fond memories of this game.

645
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,200
I think that's kind of a neat concept, too, to re-release your old game with a high res...

646
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,320
Of course, I guess this has been done a million times before with Namco games and other collections.

647
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,920
How about the whole Sega Ages?

648
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,440
I guess this isn't really a new thing to do, but I don't know.

649
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,000
Something about this game in particular, seeing as it was more of a small title, it's kind

650
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,520
of interesting to see this get re-released.

651
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,880
Where the hell's my remade friggin' blaster master?

652
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,280
You will get your remade blaster master when Jamie and I get our remade guardian legend.

653
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
Thank you very much.

654
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Drive-thru.

655
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
Hello!

656
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
Borderbun!

657
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,280
Or was it borderbun?

658
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Broderbun?

659
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,280
Broderbun?

660
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,280
Buh-buh-buh-buh.

661
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
Ugh-buh.

662
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,280
Borderbuns?

663
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,280
Border...

664
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Burntbuns?

665
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Well-formed squishybuns?

666
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,680
Do they even exist anymore?

667
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
You know what else they made?

668
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
No.

669
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,680
The print shop.

670
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,680
Remember the print shop?

671
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,680
No.

672
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,920
on the dot matrix printers and it would take like an hour to print your damn

673
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,160
banners that was you had the green and white paper wasn't that them I'm pretty

674
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,060
sure that was that shit do you know what sucks is that my old computer lab at my

675
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:23,280
college had dot matrix printers with the green and white paper comments from the

676
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,360
chat room www.orangeonstray.com click on chat lots of celebration around

677
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,540
blaster master 23rd magus would like you to know Broderbund also did where in the

678
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,660
World is Carmen Sandiego, which is another big title.

679
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,340
Yes they did.

680
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:40,860
Moving on to another story, let's head on over to Loki.

681
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:47,220
Yes, we have some news on the Xbox Live Arcade game.

682
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,440
Actually I have this game, yet have never played it.

683
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,940
Got it for free with one of those 12 month kits.

684
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:56,300
They get the headset and all that stuff and they give you Bank Shot Billiards 2.

685
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:03,200
Anyways, Bankshot Billiards 2 is now getting a new update to make it 3D.

686
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:10,080
This is news actually that was posted via Major Nelson on his wonderful podcast.

687
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,480
You know what's interesting is I tried to download the demo of Bankshot Billiards 2

688
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,320
and when I try to run it, it connects to try to get the update and then says it cannot

689
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,440
download the update in this time and kicks me out.

690
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,000
So I tried to download the demo to see this 3D-ness and it booted me out.

691
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,720
I also thought was very interesting 1200 points for that sucker that's 15 bucks

692
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,780
if you want to play that game it's not that good of a game really probably not

693
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,720
it didn't look it didn't look like it was something I had to own but a lot of

694
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,100
my friends list is playing it so I'm like what am I missing out on and I like

695
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:43,680
Yahoo pool I don't like billiards games I only have this on my 360 because it's

696
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,900
free that is it all right you guys like to send us emails once in a while over

697
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,720
www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, you can send your emails to Mailbag at

698
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,320
OrangeLoungeRadio.com and when you do so DarkSakura will dig through the email

699
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,960
and pull out some of her favorites and scold them on air.

700
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,560
I have to wear a hazmat suit lately. And last week we didn't really, DarkSakura

701
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,000
wasn't here so we did some MySpace messages because people have been sending

702
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,360
us messages on MySpace so we did a couple of those but we need to catch up

703
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:19,280
on some emails so let's have DarkSakura get on the suit, dig in the mailbag, pull

704
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:30,880
out some hopefully not anthrax what you get um anthrax bring the noise um we have one from blaze

705
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:38,560
uh hey sky loki and dark sakura why is my name not first i mean gee watch it after hearing the

706
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,920
discussion about kingdom hearts 2 and the extremely slight chance of an mmorpg i started thinking

707
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,720
about it in order to avoid having everyone as a keyblade holder thus resulting in no bad guy

708
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,040
characters perhaps a movie could introduce an evil keyblade allowing for

709
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,760
a balance of characters just a thought also I don't know if anyone still cares

710
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,020
anymore but Microsoft is seriously sending out their Xbox Live diamond cards

711
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,040
as fast as they were putting out the Xbox 360s sky by the way absolutely love

712
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,840
need for speed most wanted on my Xbox 360 how dare you bash it I I didn't

713
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:14,480
hold on I I may have bashed it and said how horrible looking it is but I also

714
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,840
said I couldn't stop playing it for like a whole week and I think that says

715
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,360
something that you can have a good sometimes there's it's it's the reason

716
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,940
why when games are reviewed by people there's that fun factor that contributes

717
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,780
really big to it that's outside of graphics outside of sound side of all

718
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,280
that crap there's fun factor and for whatever reason and I still can't put my

719
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:41,960
finger on it I found that game to be so much fun on the subject of eating

720
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,960
healthy while gaming I will take a six-pack of propel water I used to drink

721
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,420
this stuff all the time and drink that instead of a bunch of soda as always I

722
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:54,660
love the show keep up the good work that was good but it got to be a little too

723
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,660
sugary for me when I started cutting out a lot of sugar so now I'm drinking

724
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:03,720
oxygen water which gives you very clean breath that sounds like a way to rip you

725
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,860
off at the store it actually was cheaper than the other waters which is why I

726
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:13,140
bought it all right fair enough what else do we have um well um did you

727
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:19,380
already cover the MySpace message from Joey? Yes, that was last week. Well fine then. Sorry,

728
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:26,700
I'm stealing my thunder. Well look, you weren't here. Hey, I'm kidding. Yeah, I was in a coma.

729
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,740
I was dead at the time. You're gonna be back in a coma if you don't start reading some

730
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,140
more email messages. Hey, this is rude to point. Better watch out or I'll like kick

731
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:42,760
you from chat okay um got one from Robert M this is hey a lot of Rob's

732
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,880
involved with orange launch radio I noticed we have Rob way I'm a Rob now we

733
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,800
have Rob am all right hey again I didn't think you'd read my question on your

734
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,200
show let alone when there are two weeks worth of nails to go through thanks

735
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,960
again I've gone ahead and picked up beat mania and have two observations and two

736
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,360
questions about it. 1. Despite being a hopeless, hopeless novice right now, I really prefer

737
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:11,440
7-Key, the 2DX mode over 5-Key. The latter seems to only have 3 level 1 songs while 7-Key

738
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,980
seems to have a better variety of songs suited for all skill levels. 2. You mentioned the

739
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:21,520
overly colorful and technotrippy interface. To me, what it reminded me of most was Amplitude.

740
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,660
Although Harmonic's name doesn't appear on the game, I'm wondering how much involvement

741
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:31,220
the team had on this one. Zero. It's all Konami. Konami made this game the very first Beat

742
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:37,460
Mania was in 98 and I want to say the first 2DX was 2000 or 2001, don't quote me on that,

743
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,940
but somewhere in that area. Actually no wait, Beat Mania was probably 97 because DDR first

744
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:49,340
came out in 98. Beat Mania was 97. Needless to say, they're old. The emulator that was

745
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:55,500
the thing at the time was bm98 that's right that's right okay i still have bm98 why it sucks

746
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:00,860
no it doesn't because it has all of the all of the neat like the person who did the um

747
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:06,220
the metal gear music all right with the oh no the truck has started to move all right

748
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:12,300
speaking of amplitude and sort of of frequency is it possible to use the beat media controller with

749
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,620
those games i haven't really tried it but it seems to make sense doing so um i don't know i don't

750
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,520
think it works because I don't it those seven buttons on your 2d x controller

751
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:25,240
are not like circle square remapped it's a completely different signals I don't

752
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,740
think it works I I think they should I think harmonic should have released a

753
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,680
controller for those games I think it would have been a lot of fun but the

754
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,340
last one finally which of the songs on beat me in the u.s. would you most like

755
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:40,040
to see on TDR supernovas eventual console port just curious mr. T and one

756
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,160
of the club mixes of 20 November would be my pick I hate 20 November yeah no

757
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,000
So somebody in chat wanted me to say that earlier.

758
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,800
20 November's okay, but it's not as great

759
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,540
as people say it is.

760
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,600
Bad Boy Bass, hello, I love that song.

761
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,040
I'm really not very excited about many of the things

762
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,680
that are in BeatMania that aren't already on DVR.

763
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,540
There's stuff from like 8th Style I'd still like to see.

764
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,560
So, like I still wanna be able to play,

765
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,320
crap, now I forgot the name of the song.

766
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:16,200
that's right it was it was the um

767
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,720
I'm really mad at myself now for forgetting the name of the song cuz it

768
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,800
was the one that I was play

769
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,860
all the time the kind of a

770
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,080
Caribbean sounding one I want monkey dance

771
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,420
spunk spooky no no

772
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:35,240
that did neither of those sound alright forget it forget it neither

773
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,880
those sound anything remotely like that I'm okay we also have one from

774
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,880
I guess it's...

775
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,880
Our love?

776
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,880
You know, I've been wondering something for a little while now.

777
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,880
I have been listening to you guys and Gal for about a year now as a podcast.

778
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,880
On a consistent basis, you guys seem to bring your classic and more often than not obscure games from the past.

779
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,880
Which I love, by the way.

780
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,880
So my question is this. When are you going to do a strictly classic gaming episode?

781
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,880
I believe I remember that being suggested in passing on a show right before you changed to the new format.

782
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,240
I kind of miss DarkSakura's tips section when I hear the music for the mailbag, but oh well.

783
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:18,960
Um, I would speculate we'll probably do that if there's going to be a show where we want,

784
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,360
we can't be here again. Like, uh, a couple months ago, Loki had to fill in a couple weeks.

785
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,680
Uh, if we have time to pre-tape in advance, we'll probably do a classic game show next time

786
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,560
we're all not gonna be here. But honestly, because of E3 and everything, none of us can really afford

787
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,600
to all of us be gone.

788
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,960
I know, are you out next week, Dark Soccer, for birthday?

789
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,000
Yeah, I'm gonna be in a coma.

790
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,520
And then you're out in two weeks for wedding, right?

791
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,480
Yes, so are you.

792
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,000
But is the wedding on Sunday or Saturday?

793
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Yes.

794
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Oh, I thought it was Saturday this whole time.

795
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Oh, it's Sunday.

796
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Oh, crap.

797
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,240
Then maybe there'll be one coming up sooner than later.

798
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,720
We'll podcast your wedding.

799
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,720
Probably the day of Loki's wedding.

800
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,920
I joked about that, but yeah.

801
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,420
We need to plan on that.

802
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,100
probably the day of Loki's wedding since we can't do a show live maybe we'll do

803
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:09,060
that that's a good idea well maybe we can invite some other folks talk about

804
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:15,460
it too be fun well um there's also another bit on this when we mentioned

805
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:22,020
captain and he brought up kid video I used to watch kid video religiously when

806
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:29,740
I was what seven so yeah I know kid video is about a little garage band

807
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:34,080
they get sucked into an animated world it had the little pixie girl who would

808
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:39,960
sneeze and it was really crazy yeah I remember kid video do you remember kid

809
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:45,120
video no I've never played that game it's not a game oh so you're not even

810
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:52,780
paying attention that's correct I also have one from Mike G first off I'd like

811
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:57,000
to say that your guys's show is so awesome and I think you I think you guys

812
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,380
for bringing updates every week even if it's games that you don't like but let

813
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:07,020
me get out right to the point okay um first of all punctuation there is not a

814
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,920
single punctuation point except at the very end of this email I just thought

815
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:17,000
I'd point that out and I'm a grammar nerd yes you are so let me see if I can

816
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:26,460
I'm good at interpreting that stuff okay okay let me get right to the point I was

817
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:29,580
I was listening to your podcast last week while you had the guy from Konami.

818
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:33,700
Well my question is, I hear everybody talking about DDR Supernova, but for some reason it's

819
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,860
like they skipped flor- flor- dia?

820
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,860
I guess it's flor- flor- flor- Florida.

821
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,860
Florida.

822
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:40,860
But it said flor-dia.

823
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,860
Alright.

824
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,880
We have no release date or anything.

825
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,280
If you guys can give me a link or even some kind of update, I would be really grateful

826
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,040
because I know a lot of people out there that don't know either and you guys wouldn't just

827
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:57,040
be helping me but many people, thanks and keep up the good work on Miles Radio for Life.

828
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,040
You guys will get it.

829
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,040
I mean, every state's going to have it.

830
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,440
I think it wants to know when Supernova's coming out in Florida.

831
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,380
Supernova's coming out in Florida when Supernova comes out for everybody.

832
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:08,440
And I guess the rumor was that they were taking orders for the first 50 machines and then

833
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,440
it closed.

834
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:15,600
I don't really know how much to really credit all that, but I would say it was supposed

835
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,960
to be out this month, right?

836
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,920
So any day now, really, we should start seeing these machines pop up.

837
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,400
I don't think it'll really spread like wildfire till over the summer so you have

838
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,000
to wait till summer for your local arcade to get this

839
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,440
but if you live near a big city with a big arcade

840
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,400
that has had Xtreme and the other DDR games

841
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,300
this one will be coming as well just give it time

842
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,680
but yeah we don't keep tabs on every arcade in the country so we can't ask

843
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,660
don't be afraid to ask your local arcade it's a good way to show

844
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:49,600
that you support it too. DDR Freak. DDR Freak has a locations listing

845
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,720
That's true too. Anything that's put up there, being a moderator there,

846
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,760
we regularly verify those to make sure

847
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,160
that, you know, ratings, location, everything is there. Just use DDR Freaks.

848
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,880
Exactly. Location listing. I also, though, like the idea just to ask the arcade operator

849
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,040
because that shows that there's interest in the game and they're more likely to

850
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,520
order it.

851
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,400
It's very powerful. So get all your friends together and ask. Don't be afraid.

852
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,760
Couple more emails. Alrighty. Another one from Robert M.

853
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,400
I just listened to part A of the podcast

854
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,800
And I'd be genuinely surprised if the majority of those 50 launch titles

855
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,160
weren't the NES, Genesis, TurboGrafx-16 downloadables.

856
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,640
Uh, also, I think he'll found out in part B. I kinda corrected myself there.

857
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:37,600
Yeah. Well, I figured I'd go ahead and address this. Um, hopefully we'll see as many as six full retail

858
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,280
available titles to go with those.

859
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,200
Just out of curiosity and to compare how many Xbox arcade launch games were there.

860
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,240
Um, there's a question.

861
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,240
I'm sorry, I was reading chat. What was it?

862
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,240
How many Xbox Live Arcade games were there at one point?

863
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,240
Like 20?

864
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,240
No, not that many. Maybe 10.

865
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,240
10?

866
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:02,240
The first week that Xbox was out, probably about 10. I really don't know.

867
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:09,240
I'd say 10 to 15. I can't remember exactly. I bought a lot of them, but not all of them.

868
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,240
I think there was about 10. Ask Major Nelson, he'd know.

869
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,360
You say that and I keep thinking of I Dream of Jeannie.

870
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,880
Sorry.

871
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,160
The last one says, hey guys doing a great job with the podcast.

872
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,880
My favorite thing to do after work is to play World of Warcraft while listening to the show.

873
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:30,320
Right on. Alright, that's so cool. Speaking of World of Warcraft, did you...

874
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,960
Alright, sorry. Okay, sorry. Go ahead.

875
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,160
I saw the most effed up video this week and it was...

876
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,160
Lord of the Rings? No, no, the people crashing the funeral party.

877
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:47,800
Like, somebody in real life passed away, and they were holding an online funeral service

878
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,320
for this, I think it was a she, that passed away.

879
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:57,040
And since it was on a PVP server, these guys had posted about it on a forum, and what happened

880
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,320
is that, I think it was a Horde character, well a bunch of this whole big group on the

881
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,720
Alliance side came to the funeral and killed them all.

882
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,500
That's horrible!

883
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:13,560
Part of me is like, that is so wrong, but there's another half of me like the same half

884
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:18,560
that really likes South Park and that fucked up stuff that goes, you know, like, and I

885
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,720
know it's really wrong, but that's, let me put it this way, it goes to show why I hate

886
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,720
the PVP servers on World of Warcraft.

887
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,920
Sorry to this guy if you're a PVP player, whatever floats your boat, I personally hate

888
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,140
the PVP servers.

889
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:34,820
I had bad experience with the PVP, but anyway.

890
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,820
Can I finish my email now?

891
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,080
Yes you may, sorry.

892
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,620
Thank you, Rob!

893
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:47,160
Although this isn't exactly headline news like the Red Steel screenshots drool, I work

894
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,720
for Philips and they're working on this new technology which sounds like something I've

895
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,760
only dreamed about.

896
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:57,000
Imagine feeling the rush of wind when jumping out of your plane in Metal Gear Solid 3 or

897
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,920
having your sofa rumble and all the lights in your room flicker red when Sephiroth appears

898
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,020
in the flames in Final Fantasy VII.

899
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:09,160
This could be really cheesy, but if the technology is really good and becomes widespread, and

900
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,360
developers start creating games with this in mind, along with how excited I am about

901
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:19,400
the innovative revolution, the next few years could be huge for gaming, and where it's headed.

902
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:25,260
I gave a link to ambx.com, there's some video on the site that gives you an idea of the

903
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:30,060
lighting effects we're talking about, lightning strikes, and all the lights in the rooms flicker,

904
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:34,240
a plane flies by and creates a rush of wind, sure it's from dinky fans, but still.

905
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,260
And this isn't just for gaming, suppose it's for movies, music, PC versions of games are

906
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:42,420
supposed to already be released this year, and console versions next.

907
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,060
Look for this at E3.

908
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,060
Think this will catch on?

909
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:49,120
If not this, then technology like this revolution seems to be a step in that direction.

910
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,120
Keep up the good work.

911
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,680
If you use this, you can refer to me as Bear Who Drive...

912
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,680
Bear Who Drive Car.

913
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,360
I'm sorry, I actually didn't see that until the very end.

914
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,360
My apologies.

915
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,360
Um, P.S.

916
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,720
I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, but it's ridiculous how much I want a goddamn DS Lite.

917
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,520
I also agree with Sky, Final Fantasy XI is going to die shortly after Xbox 360 has released this expansion.

918
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,600
I did say, I said that, I guess I must have.

919
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,880
I don't think it's gonna die, I just think it's gonna, I actually think it's gonna...

920
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,040
Oh, I remember what it was. The comment was that I said the third expansion is gonna be the last one,

921
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,640
probably, and then it will start to die off.

922
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:25,360
I don't think it'll be shortly, but I think, you know, in the next couple years...

923
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:29,560
There will always be crazies that play Final Fantasy XI, probably I'll be one of them.

924
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:33,580
Just like there's crazies that still play EverQuest, and you know I use that term

925
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:38,140
endearingly, but I think the popularity,

926
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:42,900
you'll see server consolidations in a good two years.

927
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,780
So, the other thing I want to comment on that, the whole

928
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:50,020
room lighting thing, that technology's actually been around a while.

929
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:53,420
On the Commodore 64, I remember this, there used to be a program

930
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:57,220
where you could have the Commodore 64 control the lights in your house

931
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,260
for like when you're away on vacation or whatever, you could have the Commodore 64

932
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:04,220
regulating the lights in your house. So it's not this huge... Uh, I think this is a little something different.

933
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,880
Well, no, I know, but I know it's a completely, but they're saying that, you

934
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,660
know, you want to change the lights red for when Sephiroth comes in, all this other

935
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:14,380
like lighting effects you can do in your house, right? No, it'd be more like an

936
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,740
interactive station.

937
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:21,060
Alright. But, um, they actually, there were things very similar to that, the

938
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,620
previous E3s, like the,

939
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:26,140
what was it called, the ass kicker or something?

940
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:30,180
that that thing that you put under your chair and it makes and you feel the bass

941
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,540
in your butt or something

942
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:35,020
I got I thought that thing was kinda cool but you know like it

943
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:39,580
especially for the music games or for some the effects in the games

944
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,700
you know I I think though that

945
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,380
having something immersive like that is gonna be pricey but I think it really

946
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,500
would enhance the

947
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,540
experience be interesting alright

948
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:56,600
Is that it? Alright. You know what, with all that we're just one step closer to the

949
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,240
holodeck

950
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:01,760
from Star Trek. That's where gaming will be in 50 years. It'll be the holodeck.

951
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,900
You know, I had this conversation with somebody like a year and a half ago.

952
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,120
We were doing our big Trekkie nerd discussion and we were talking about how holodecks are

953
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:10,560
like

954
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:15,320
the Nintendo of the future. Pretty much. Someday we'll do this show in a

955
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:19,280
in a holodeck form. It'll be amazing. You could, you know, sit on our laps during the

956
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,300
show. No, please don't. That's violating us.

957
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:29,940
Anyway, moving on, I think we have a contest to settle, do we not?

958
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,940
Perhaps.

959
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,940
That's right.

960
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:36,420
We have a little giveaway that we did last week, and that was with 24.

961
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,100
We said we were going to give away a prize pack.

962
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:45,340
We said you had to email us, jack24 at orangelaunchradio.com, with two people that had died during season

963
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,340
five.

964
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,820
We're going to pick ourselves a winner right now.

965
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,580
MarkSakura, give me a number.

966
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,820
That many times nine.

967
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,300
Something between one and that many times nine.

968
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,620
Four.

969
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,020
Four.

970
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:58,020
You always keep them low.

971
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,020
Let's do this.

972
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,220
One, two, three, four.

973
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,220
Here's our winner.

974
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,220
Our winner is...

975
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:06,220
Oh, I have to verify that they got two characters right here.

976
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:09,040
Yes, they said David Palmer and Edgar Stiles.

977
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,420
Those are indeed two people that died this season.

978
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:17,220
So say congratulations, everybody, to MiniMe283 won the 24th contest.

979
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,220
One of our chatters.

980
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:22,300
Yes, one of our chatters. I like it when the chatty people win. Good job!

981
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,380
He was actually, I think, eating right now.

982
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:27,380
So he's away and didn't even hear that.

983
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:29,040
Yeah. Alright, well...

984
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,180
That would be mini food.

985
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,700
Alright, so DarkSucker, you remember what they're going to win in that prize pack?

986
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,940
Will I forward this to myself here?

987
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:41,840
Oh, I'm sorry. It was the game and the shirt, right? Yeah, a bunch of stuff.

988
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,100
That'll be good times.

989
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:48,620
So big thanks to our buddies over at 2K Games that are hooking us up with these prize packs.

990
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,460
Appreciate it.

991
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:55,420
It's awesome. People like to win free stuff. They like to win free stuff so much

992
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:57,700
that we're going to give away something else right now.

993
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,140
We're going to give away also a copy of

994
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,720
Amped 3

995
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,220
for the 360. That's right, for the Xbox 360.

996
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:09,380
And you've played this game a lot, Loki, right? What do you do in this game?

997
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:16,380
Well, it's a basic snowboarding game. It's really... what kind of sets it apart is the way they kind of do the storyline.

998
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:26,380
It's done with like sock puppets and just weird... it's just very trippy. Very punkish. So definitely worth checking out.

999
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:35,380
And yeah, really cool game. A lot of people kind of skimmed over it and now it's only $39.99 I think out there in stores.

1000
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:38,420
so if you can find a used copy that's even better

1001
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:44,260
so check it out. Alright let's give that one away right now we're gonna do

1002
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:47,820
Loki give me a number between one and that many times 10

1003
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:51,300
okay let's go with

1004
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:55,020
14. Alright let's see

1005
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:58,700
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

1006
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:04,580
13, 14 and

1007
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:08,780
Is that the same person that won last? No, I don't think that is. I think this is a different person.

1008
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:15,580
So I think this one wins. This goes to MikeG1amp3.

1009
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:19,380
Good job. Excellent. Congratulations to you, my friend.

1010
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:23,020
You're a winner. Thank you to everybody that participated,

1011
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:26,300
and we'll be doing more giveaways in the future, of course.

1012
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:31,900
Alright, let's move on to our next story, and that comes courtesy of me,

1013
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:36,260
Final Fantasy XI, you know I've been playing the crap out of that game lately

1014
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:40,140
and I thought this is very interesting the new expansion Treasures of Ot Urgen

1015
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:40,940
comes out

1016
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:44,200
on April 18th although I have a feeling that's the ship day meaning it'll

1017
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,880
probably really be on shelves the 19th

1018
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,460
yeah here's the thing even if you buy it on the 19th

1019
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:53,680
you can't actually play it until the 20th of April

1020
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,640
because the reason why they're doing this is because the game will be out in all

1021
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,520
territories until that time so essentially they're

1022
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,960
giving everybody the shot at starting at the same time

1023
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,440
secretly I think there's also a 420 reference to be made in there

1024
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,600
but regardless even if you buy this expansion realize you can't use it

1025
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,640
until April 20th is when they'll actually turn it on so kinda interesting

1026
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,920
I like that idea though keeps things fair yes April 20th where the secret

1027
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,040
secret character

1028
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:22,480
junkie will be available that's right junkie whore will be an unlockable job

1029
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,360
class in the new Final Fantasy I'll be great

1030
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,360
and they'll all be Mithras

1031
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,080
Imagine that, they'll all be Mithras.

1032
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:32,040
I thought they'd be Taro.

1033
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,520
I would play a Taro junkie whore.

1034
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,040
I think that would be fun, actually.

1035
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,400
It'd be a good time.

1036
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,280
All right, Loki, what do you got?

1037
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:44,640
I've got some info about the IEMA and VSDA merging.

1038
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,720
And of course, I always hear about the VSDA,

1039
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,280
just job-related stuff.

1040
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,400
The Interactive Air Team Merchants Association,

1041
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,800
basically the VSDA of video games, and the VSDA,

1042
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:02,280
the Video Software Dealers Association, who basically represent all the mass merchants,

1043
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:09,120
video specialty stores, etc. Well, now they're combined, so it's going to be one place for

1044
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:15,300
all the interactive software sales and stuff. And basically, they have to say, by coming

1045
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:20,000
together in one organization, the retailers, distributors of DVDs and video games will increase

1046
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,760
their collective power and the benefit from business acumen and product knowledge of one

1047
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:34,440
another. And that's basically quoted from the chairman, VSDA chairman Bob Geisman. So,

1048
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:39,560
I think that's pretty cool. That means I might have to go to VSDA this year. I don't know,

1049
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:44,560
they always throw a really cool show down in Vegas. So, right about the same time as

1050
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:47,480
the porno convention. Right next door.

1051
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,560
What do you think the long-term effects of this will be on the game industry?

1052
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,820
That's good. You're gonna see, definitely

1053
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:57,440
you know, the IEMA

1054
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,760
and VSDA are gonna be, you know, ones saying

1055
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:05,120
you know, hell no, we don't want these stupid video game laws, you know,

1056
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,320
ones that they're trying to pass limiting the sales of this stuff.

1057
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:12,600
It's definitely, you know, gonna be easier to go up against people that try to

1058
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,720
propose this kind of stuff.

1059
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,920
which is always good, I think, you know, let the parents regulate what

1060
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,240
their kids play. So, always a good thing.

1061
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,680
Alright, let's go on to our next story,

1062
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,840
Dark Sakura! Some people are a little too into this guitar hero, aren't they?

1063
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,640
Yeah, they've been taking hacksaws to it. I mean, sorry, they were hacking

1064
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:37,440
into the controller. They were hacksawing it with a hacksaw? It got hacksawed hardcore.

1065
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,080
No, they have actually, a group of

1066
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,760
students at University of California decided to

1067
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,840
try to turn the Guitar Hero peripheral into

1068
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:52,400
a real instrument. They've mapped different WAV files into the controller's

1069
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,640
buttons so that you press the button and it will start playing the loop.

1070
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,540
And so you, because you've mapped the different sounds, you can sort of play

1071
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,880
different stuff on it. It's more like,

1072
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,980
well, I don't know, like... It's a MIDI sequencer. Yeah,

1073
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:07,280
that's what I was about to say. But,

1074
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,680
but I mean, even Red Octane's kinda,

1075
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,120
you know thinks it's pretty cool there's a quote here that says

1076
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:18,560
we in harmonics both very much I'm sorry are both very much encouraged by this

1077
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,400
type of fandom

1078
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,920
having a game that a community like this thrives around is a great achievement

1079
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:29,640
but it's the community that keeps it going they're awesome so

1080
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,800
I thought that was actually a quote from Jon Tam I like that they endorse the

1081
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,240
hacking that's pretty cool of them

1082
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:39,360
you know well you know how I honestly think that

1083
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:44,280
we're gonna see more new innovation based on the fan community

1084
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,960
you know because I really see that a lot of

1085
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:52,440
game companies are not going to be as willing to experiment in depth

1086
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:56,200
but when it comes from the fans they see that there's a type of interest in this

1087
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,240
type of thing that

1088
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:01,080
it might turn on a few light bulbs and have the hamster wheels moving

1089
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:05,200
Alright, moving on to another story

1090
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,120
there's this new Spike Lee movie The Inside Man and

1091
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:16,160
Inside the inside man. There's actually a scene and this is a story. This is a news article coming from joystick.com

1092
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:24,440
That actually there's a scene an inside man that uses grand theft auto or a not the actual game

1093
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,560
But a grand theft auto like game

1094
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:34,880
To do this very violent scene where I guess some guy gets a hand grenade in his mouth or something is the scene there

1095
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,960
in the game

1096
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:41,200
But it's in the movie, because they're trying to depict video games as violent.

1097
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:46,360
And Spike Lee is hoping that this scene doesn't actually get done in a future game.

1098
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,360
He explains,

1099
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:51,400
I just hope people understand that that is an absolute statement about my horror at how

1100
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:56,080
violent these games that young kids play are, and also the infatuation with violence and

1101
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,280
gangster rap among the black community.

1102
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:02,960
It's not a real game, but not that far-fetched from the games that are being sold.

1103
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:08,320
It's my thought that Spike Lee has decided to believe everything he sees on TV.

1104
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,320
You know what?

1105
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,720
That's not violent enough.

1106
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,260
I'm not satisfied.

1107
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,260
You want to see more?

1108
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:16,560
You want to see more violent stuff?

1109
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,560
Hell yeah.

1110
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:22,520
Alright, might I also point out Spike Lee has brought to you many different films out

1111
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,520
there.

1112
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,400
Trying to think of some of these that are R-rated movies that he's done.

1113
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,100
What is Do the Right Thing R-rated?

1114
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,560
I think so.

1115
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:39,700
see yeah USA that was an r-rated movie and let's see how about Malcolm X was

1116
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:46,420
that rated R as well I wouldn't doubt it uh actually was pg-13 still not

1117
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:50,500
appropriate for children under 13 though you get the idea here I'm just kind of

1118
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:55,220
trying to be a smartass on this one you know Hollywood puts out the violent

1119
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:59,900
stuff too so I don't really get it it seems like it's the pot calling the

1120
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:04,020
Kettle Black, which is probably a really bad analogy to use in that scenario, but...

1121
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:09,340
You know what? I believe this is the way we should eliminate, um, contestants from American

1122
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:13,100
Idol. But... I think they need to have Battle Royale.

1123
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,300
America does not like your singing, therefore we will take off your head.

1124
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,500
You know what MMO we need? Battle Royale. The MMO.

1125
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,820
That would actually be a lot of fun. I want a game that's just shoving grenades

1126
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:25,780
in people's mouths. It'd just be a big PVP.

1127
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:28,960
Maybe that could be like the game, you know how, uh, people always make games to answer

1128
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,560
Wait a second! Wait a second!

1129
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,960
What? I do remember a game where you shove grenades in people's mouths. What?

1130
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:41,460
Blaster Master! That fucking frog had it coming to him and he tossed grenades in his mouth!

1131
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:45,760
Fuck that! Spike Lee, you were beat by it quite a long time.

1132
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,840
But that's when you hit pause while it's exploding and then you wait like six seconds

1133
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,260
and unpause and it'll kill him.

1134
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,260
Exactly, but still it's been done.

1135
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:58,600
Yes. Blaster Master did it. You know I think somebody should make a game that's

1136
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,600
like kaboom, but instead it's just a giant mouth that's catching all these grenades falling

1137
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:07,520
from the sky? That'd be great! What a perfect response to this article. And send it, send

1138
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,520
a nice little care package over to Spike Lee and say, with love, the gaming community.

1139
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:19,520
Loki. Speaking of movies soon to be made. Yes, they're making a movie for Cold Fear.

1140
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:28,600
Basically, a press release put out by Dark Works S.A., the leading French video game

1141
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:33,240
developer, although I thought Ubisoft was the leading French video game developer, but

1142
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:39,640
I could be wrong, that they are, I don't know, they're putting out another movie that's going

1143
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,840
to probably be crap.

1144
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,520
Are they making it in French?

1145
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,520
Or what?

1146
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:48,620
I don't know, to be honest.

1147
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:52,560
I see video game movie for a game that I haven't played

1148
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,160
you know

1149
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,320
I don't know

1150
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,800
although it should be noted that Darkworks

1151
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,880
they

1152
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,040
did previously release Alone in the Dark The New Nightmare

1153
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,620
which if I remember correctly I think that one sucked

1154
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:09,920
I think that was the last one that came out

1155
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,160
well moving on to a title that everybody recognizes uh... at least

1156
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,040
quite a few million of them this week

1157
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,360
what game would that be? Dark Soccer?

1158
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:22,160
that would be a skies voice the game yeah right

1159
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:26,720
actually a kingdom hearts to hit two point five million uh...

1160
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:30,040
it's actually approaching ten million uh... in the world

1161
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,040
it's pretty cool huh

1162
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:35,440
wow that's a lot of uh... sales but yeah but for japan and north america top two

1163
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,300
point five million that's one point two million for japan since uh...

1164
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,760
december twenty second one point three million in north america since uh... the

1165
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,220
twenty eighth of uh... last month

1166
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:46,360
uh...

1167
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,680
this series worldwide has hit 8.5 million

1168
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,840
with the European release they're expecting it to top 10

1169
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,840
10 million and actually

1170
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,640
the numbers are well-deserved it really is a very well done game

1171
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,320
very cool this game might sell that many copies

1172
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:09,360
probably not but Metroid Prime 3 is going to be the flagship title for

1173
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,000
Nintendo Revolution

1174
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,400
what? well that's what they're saying Nintendo is going to be showing this

1175
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:19,120
fully playable at the E3 Expo.

1176
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:23,320
Now I'm wondering if it's not Metroid Prime 3 on GameCube but with

1177
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,640
revolution enhancements

1178
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,760
sorta like they're saying is going to happen with or that would have to be

1179
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,660
happening with Zelda.

1180
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:31,920
I think that's a little more along the lines of what's really going on is that

1181
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,320
Metroid Prime 3 is probably a GameCube game but

1182
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:38,220
with revolution aspect to it. So that should be very interesting because

1183
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:41,440
this game kind of... Metroid Prime 3. Huh? Prime 3. Right.

1184
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,680
That's what I said. You said Hunters. Did I? Oh, I'm sorry. Metroid Prime 3.

1185
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:49,240
My bad. So Metroid Prime 3 is going to be shown at E3.

1186
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,120
And this kind of came out of nowhere a little bit because I think the focus has

1187
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:55,480
been on the Metroid DS game that people sort of forgot that, oh yeah,

1188
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:58,520
I guess they could do another sequel to Metroid Prime if they wanted to, huh?

1189
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:02,280
So, be very interesting to see how that goes. They could do billions of sequels. They could do billions

1190
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:07,160
among billions. So we'll see what happens. That should be an exciting time. I really

1191
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:11,000
liked Metroid Prime 2 at last year's E3, but I never really...

1192
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,360
I mean, it's just my GameCube. I have to be honest, I don't play it so much because

1193
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,540
there's not a lot of new titles to get really excited about on GameCube anymore.

1194
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:21,380
Maybe with the Zelda, we'll see. One more story for this segment, Loki.

1195
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:25,300
Yes, you know when you thought that

1196
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,940
you couldn't whore Burger King enough in 360 games,

1197
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:33,420
well you're wrong. They're gonna actually make their own

1198
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:36,900
Xbox 360 games. That's right,

1199
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:40,060
Burger King is going to be making

1200
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:44,900
games for the 360 and Xbox. I guess they will be Xbox games that will be fully

1201
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:49,020
compatible with the 360 that will be gonna be selling for three dollars and sixty

1202
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:49,740
nine cents.

1203
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:53,580
I'm sure these will be

1204
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:58,180
top-shelf games. You'll be buying them with your Angus

1205
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:58,980
cheesy bacon

1206
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:02,420
steak burger, which I might add by the way isn't very good.

1207
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,700
Not a very good game. They do have three games that are going to be coming out

1208
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,740
very appropriately deemed action,

1209
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:13,900
fighting and racing. The action game, they're comparing it to

1210
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:17,700
Halo or Destroy All Humans

1211
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:22,860
which, okay. Which will probably turn out more like Wolfenstein 3D, but yeah.

1212
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:27,300
The fighting game is supposed to be combining elements of Street Fighter

1213
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,300
and moral combat.

1214
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:32,260
That's excellent.

1215
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:35,460
Who's the king gonna fight? We all know the king would be, who's gonna fight?

1216
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:36,980
I don't know, who cares?

1217
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:40,980
the evil, he could fight, he could beat the shit out of Hamburglar and Ronald McDonald

1218
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:42,820
I don't know, they might have problems with that.

1219
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:46,860
And racing is basically gonna be combining

1220
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:50,660
or they said it's very comparable to Need for Speed

1221
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:54,660
or Forza, which I had to laugh. They do have some

1222
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:57,940
or I should say Kotaku posted some

1223
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:02,300
screenshots or I guess, I don't know

1224
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:05,380
Internal documents or something? Something like that of

1225
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:09,080
concept art I guess. I heard they've gotten a little bit of hot water

1226
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:12,440
yeah yeah but the screenshots are hilarious

1227
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:16,280
there's like one that's looking like the Kings trying to like give a hamburger to

1228
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,480
some prostitute

1229
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:22,200
and there's another one where... Is that for real? Come on, this shit has joke written all

1230
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:22,720
over it like

1231
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:26,240
a commercial or something marketing campaign. Well

1232
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:32,080
I don't know but you know it'd be interesting to try out, let me put it that way

1233
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:37,080
I don't know what kind of achievement points I can get for the Burger King games.

1234
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:40,080
Because that's really what I'm concerned about.

1235
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:44,080
Alright, looking in the chat room for some comments there.

1236
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,080
Psycoon suggests World of Burger Craft.

1237
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,080
That might be fun.

1238
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,080
Ota G says Burger Combat!

1239
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,080
Plays a little music behind that I'm sure.

1240
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:56,080
DJ Poo Eater says Clerk Killer.

1241
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:00,080
So the King could be fighting all the Burger King employees.

1242
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:06,320
employees that might be exciting who knows oh you know what how about the BK

1243
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,640
kids club remember the BK kids club that's who the king needs to regulate on

1244
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:17,360
that would be fun that'd be kick-ass all right we're gonna go to a break here

1245
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:21,340
we'll be back a little later on with more of orange lounge radio orange
