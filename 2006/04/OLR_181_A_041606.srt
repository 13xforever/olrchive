1
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:14,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:38,271
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

3
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:06,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week?

4
00:01:06,752 --> 00:01:07,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week.

5
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:10,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally couldn't move, so I had to give blood.

6
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:13,676
[SPEAKER_05]: But you made quite the turnaround because you were out rocking out last night, right?

7
00:01:15,838 --> 00:01:20,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I started feeling better by Monday, and then Tuesday I felt a lot better, and Wednesday I was back at work.

8
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:24,482
[SPEAKER_00]: I even did my show on Tuesday, even though I said I wasn't going to.

9
00:01:24,723 --> 00:01:28,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear me joking in the last podcast that you were playing hooky so you could stay home and play Kingdom Hearts 2?

10
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:31,224
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not far off.

11
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:32,104
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.

12
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:34,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did play a whole lot of Kingdom Hearts.

13
00:01:45,997 --> 00:01:48,158
[SPEAKER_01]: People in the chatroom are saying I sound all stuffed up.

14
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:52,460
[SPEAKER_01]: That's slightly true because you know it is springtime and I have allergies.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,683
[SPEAKER_01]: But when in fact I was actually up until 4.30am because I went to see the most amazing live band ever.

16
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:02,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was?

17
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:02,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Babyland.

18
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:04,625
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally get to see Babyland live.

19
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:05,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so happy.

20
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:09,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all the other bands were like Suck, Suck, More Suck, and then the Mormons.

21
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:11,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss Ninja Academy.

22
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:12,876
[SPEAKER_01]: 8-Bit was cool.

23
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:20,501
[SPEAKER_01]: We went outside for, because I went with a guano girl and she went to go have a smoke and we were outside.

24
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:30,649
[SPEAKER_01]: While we were outside, this is video game related by the way, I hear this bass line because they're sort of like kind of weird rap, you know, group, but they're wearing hazmat suits too.

25
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:37,314
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hear this bass line that sounds familiar and it turns out that it's the Zelda music as a bass line.

26
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:39,001
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

27
00:02:39,422 --> 00:02:40,142
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.

28
00:02:40,262 --> 00:02:43,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I wouldn't listen to 8-Bit all the time, but their music was pretty cool.

29
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:44,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we should get them on the show at some point.

30
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:45,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

31
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:48,148
[SPEAKER_01]: But Babyland owned the stage.

32
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:49,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I was bouncing and jumping.

33
00:02:51,191 --> 00:02:52,011
[SPEAKER_01]: We get out of there at like 1.30.

34
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I get home at 3.30 and, you know, of course I date my live journal.

35
00:02:57,896 --> 00:02:58,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a true addict.

36
00:02:58,757 --> 00:02:59,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a true addict.

37
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:00,218
[SPEAKER_01]: I have photos.

38
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:02,780
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be sharing photos with our chat room tonight.

39
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:04,121
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um...

40
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:06,287
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

41
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:37,458
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP Silent Hill

42
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:04,473
[SPEAKER_05]: How about that?

43
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:10,559
[SPEAKER_05]: The source is self-styled online radio station Orange Lounge Radio.

44
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:13,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Never heard of that.

45
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:14,282
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about that.

46
00:04:14,343 --> 00:04:15,323
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of no-names over there.

47
00:04:15,984 --> 00:04:17,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, the official story.

48
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:20,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently Konami reps had not returned requests for comment on this.

49
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:23,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, sounds pretty interesting.

50
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm calling April Fool's.

51
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:27,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally think they're lying.

52
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:30,064
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53
00:04:53,348 --> 00:05:01,391
[SPEAKER_05]: People took notice this week when it crowed that it had uncovered a slew of unannounced games and ship dates courtesy of a leaked list Konami had sent to retailers.

54
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:11,781
[SPEAKER_03]: They basically send it to anybody who sells games.

55
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:14,103
[SPEAKER_03]: We probably get some sort of information like this.

56
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:14,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

57
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:16,827
[SPEAKER_05]: And blah, blah, blah.

58
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:20,231
[SPEAKER_05]: They talk about the titles that this website decided to announce.

59
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:23,715
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Supernova is going to happen on September 13th.

60
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:27,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Dance Revolution Universe on October 11th.

61
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,540
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Ultramix 4 on November 14th.

62
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:32,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Castlevania, Portrait of Ruin on November 15th.

63
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:34,145
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, that's Portrait, not Portal.

64
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:34,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, guys.

65
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:37,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Portrait of Ruin.

66
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:42,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And then PSP, Silent Hill, Original Sin on October 18th.

67
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:49,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Although very interesting, because I seem to recall this website had a giant disclaimer that said all these dates are subject to change, as release dates always do.

68
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:50,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

69
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:51,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

70
00:05:51,277 --> 00:05:51,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, whatever.

71
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:52,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

72
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:57,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, and then of course two new Death Junior games, but people don't seem to care as much about those.

73
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I thought this was interesting too.

74
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:04,928
[SPEAKER_05]: This list also promises a potentially very lucrative tie-in for Konami.

75
00:06:05,388 --> 00:06:10,890
[SPEAKER_05]: According to Orange Lounge Radio, the list has Karaoke Revolution American Idol arriving in stores on November 15th.

76
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,933
[SPEAKER_05]: If true, the game would be the second one based on the mega popular television series after Codemasters dismally reviewed 2003 game.

77
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:24,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind that Konami already announced back in October that they were going to do the American Idol franchise.

78
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I know because we covered it on this program.

79
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:28,838
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it still is a rumor.

80
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:30,259
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dirty rumor at this point.

81
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Who actually listens to us?

82
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:32,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot.

83
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody knows of Orange Launch Radio.

84
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,362
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been low-key for the past few years.

85
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:36,942
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

86
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:38,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio

87
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:02,308
[SPEAKER_05]: But somehow, that whole time, we've managed to be Loki.

88
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:05,816
[SPEAKER_05]: So our longtime fans, you know, you've been a part of something for a long time.

89
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:06,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always been Loki.

90
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:07,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you've always been Loki.

91
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:09,636
[SPEAKER_01]: No, shut up.

92
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:36,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Castlevania was such a kickass game on the DS.

93
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:39,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course there was going to be another DS game coming.

94
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:41,858
[SPEAKER_05]: The Silent Hill remake has been running around.

95
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:42,738
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a rumor.

96
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,780
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered that, what, three weeks ago?

97
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:53,626
[SPEAKER_03]: They talked about, well, they were going to make, other than the Silent Hill experience, they were going to be doing a PSP game anyway, so it's like, okay.

98
00:07:53,646 --> 00:08:00,510
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a speculation given from some other commentary about them remaking based on the movie.

99
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:02,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Remaking the first game based on the movie.

100
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:06,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, DDR is going to have home releases this year.

101
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:08,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're not going to release it at home.

102
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:08,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

103
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:15,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind the fact that when they were advertising Supernova, they said that it's going to have some connectivity to home versions.

104
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:19,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously, there's got to be a new home version coming out.

105
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:21,064
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

106
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:22,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we really deserve all this notoriety?

107
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:25,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do people care so much about this story?

108
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:27,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people like release dates.

109
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we beat them to it.

110
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:31,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though release dates are always subject to change.

111
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:32,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

112
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,811
[SPEAKER_03]: They're always subject to change.

113
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:42,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, by the time we get down to it, well, you know, to be honest, the DDR releases, I'm not too surprised on because they release DDR about the same time every year.

114
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:47,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you get the Xbox version, you know, sometime in November, you know, usually the first half.

115
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,628
[SPEAKER_03]: and the PS2 version sometime in September.

116
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:52,650
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the same time every year.

117
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:56,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I found the whole fallout over this story very fascinating.

118
00:08:56,253 --> 00:09:03,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the part that fascinated me most wasn't the notoriety itself, because I understand people care about Silent Hill and Castlevania and DDR.

119
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,242
[SPEAKER_05]: All three of them have very rabid fan bases, but what surprised me

120
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:09,726
[SPEAKER_05]: was the reaction on the internet out there to these stories.

121
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:15,852
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really funny because when DDR Freak, Bomani Style, those sites picked up the story, it was reported as fact.

122
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:23,699
[SPEAKER_05]: But when other sites, bigger name sites, picked this up, it was reported as rumor, which I thought was very, very interesting.

123
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:24,680
[SPEAKER_05]: And you bring up a good point.

124
00:09:24,861 --> 00:09:26,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Are people just upset that we beat them to it?

125
00:09:27,743 --> 00:09:28,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

126
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:31,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, remind us, Loki, where did this come from?

127
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:33,454
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a list that goes out?

128
00:09:33,594 --> 00:09:40,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this information got sent to our buyer, the person that maintains our item database.

129
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:44,657
[SPEAKER_03]: This was sent to us and entered into our item database.

130
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:49,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I merely get a report every now and then when they change dates.

131
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:53,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a date change report, and I notice Bomberman Act 0.

132
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:54,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360, PSP

133
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:19,425
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura,

134
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:53,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, release dates to me are not really a big deal, but I just thought it was interesting because there's a lot of these games that we knew were coming out anyways, and now that we had dates, it's kind of making them more official.

135
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:56,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Also kind of gives you an idea of what they're going to be showing at E3 this year.

136
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:56,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, hold on.

137
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:58,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought you were going to say some more stuff.

138
00:10:58,892 --> 00:10:59,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold that thought for a minute, though.

139
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:00,113
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

140
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:11,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, okay, here's the interesting thing, because what I thought was interesting about the reaction is that people didn't believe it when it was on our site, but when somebody else, one of the big name sites reported it, then,

141
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:13,884
[SPEAKER_05]: It was validated.

142
00:11:14,124 --> 00:11:14,745
[SPEAKER_05]: It was true.

143
00:11:15,686 --> 00:11:16,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what, guys?

144
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:20,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Those big sites all copied from our list.

145
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:22,557
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the proof.

146
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:30,961
[SPEAKER_05]: The proof is, is that when these websites ran a story that said Konami leaked information or whatever, they listed the same dates we did.

147
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:36,464
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we didn't tell you was, Loki only posted the games he thought you'd want to know about, right?

148
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:37,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

149
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:42,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So a website that would have found this about Konami games would have picked up the other

150
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:49,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Lower name titles that maybe we didn't think you originally wanted to know about, but now, after all this fear, we guess you do want to know about.

151
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:50,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

152
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:54,160
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki, what are some other Konami games that were on this list?

153
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:56,742
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, Rengoku 2.

154
00:11:57,603 --> 00:12:00,766
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's really sad is I actually played Rengoku last E3.

155
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:05,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually brought it with me on my PSP, and I love this game, except it was really boring.

156
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,932
[SPEAKER_03]: But for whatever reason, Rengoku 2 is coming out in July 12th.

157
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,612
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's slated for right now.

158
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:16,074
[SPEAKER_03]: About the same time I... No, actually, I think Rengoku came out later than that last year.

159
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:19,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, yeah, okay game, I guess.

160
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddamn screensaver.

161
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:24,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking hate these stupid... That's why you turned them off.

162
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,860
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like the fishies.

163
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, on top of that, we've also got... Let's see here.

164
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,179
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a Yu-Gi-Oh!

165
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,800
[SPEAKER_03]: fan, there's going to be lots of stuff for you.

166
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,640
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got Yu-Gi-Oh!

167
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,462
[SPEAKER_03]: GX Tag Force coming out on the PSP.

168
00:12:38,562 --> 00:12:39,903
[SPEAKER_03]: That's in November 15th.

169
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:46,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaolin Showdown, which is apparently based on some anime show that's, I think, on the WB or whatever.

170
00:12:47,108 --> 00:12:54,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, PSP, and I think DS.

171
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:57,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one's coming out on November 15th.

172
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:01,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Online Chess Kingdoms PSP.

173
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:03,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so looking forward to that.

174
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:06,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Also November 15th.

175
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:08,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerd.

176
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:11,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Winx Club Quest for Codex.

177
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:12,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, the Winx.

178
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,340
[SPEAKER_05]: That was last year's E3 for me.

179
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Standing in Konami's booth jamming to that Winx song.

180
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,481
[SPEAKER_01]: That you know that song frightens me.

181
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,282
[SPEAKER_05]: It's stuck in my head from last year's E3 being at that booth.

182
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:24,342
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an infectious song.

183
00:13:24,382 --> 00:13:24,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't mess with me.

184
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:27,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Well anyways, Winx Club Quest for Codex.

185
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:36,919
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be coming out, looks like, October 25th, along with Steel Horizon on the PSP, which I believe is a naval warfare game.

186
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's a Marvel trading card game, to be honest.

187
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:41,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this all Konami?

188
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:42,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all Konami.

189
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:47,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvel trading card games coming out on the PSP, and I want to say the DS.

190
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:49,326
[SPEAKER_03]: So that should be interesting.

191
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:52,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they're trying to, you know, I guess since Yu-Gi-Oh!

192
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:54,109
[SPEAKER_03]: is popular, they're trying some other stuff here.

193
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And... I want to say, I think

194
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:02,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Gradius Collections coming out next month, June 14th, but I knew that for a while.

195
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:06,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Demon Chaos coming out next month.

196
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:12,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Lunar Knights Vampire Hunt is going to be coming out November 15th.

197
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:13,164
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

198
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:16,044
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that's about it.

199
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:18,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Wake me up when we get a Goemon game.

200
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:26,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what I think is interesting about this is that, you know, and if Konami, anybody from Konami is listening and is ticked off about this, please don't be.

201
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:33,958
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just repeating information that's already been put out there into the retailers and we figure, well, since retailers know about this, you know, maybe the gamers want to know about this too.

202
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:39,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's the same thing like when other websites post a goddamn list from GameStop.

203
00:14:39,702 --> 00:14:41,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are internalists that they actually...

204
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:50,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And to lessen the blow a little bit, do you have anything from another game company that people might want to know about?

205
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:51,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah, we do.

206
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:53,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, no.

207
00:14:54,447 --> 00:14:57,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a look-see here, some stuff maybe later on this year.

208
00:14:57,328 --> 00:15:00,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for example, this is not in any order.

209
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:07,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, for example, there was some games, actually they announced open season, I think, this week as well.

210
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:11,237
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of the ones that's going to be based on, I think, a DreamWorks movie or something like that.

211
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:14,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Some animated movie about animals getting back at hunters or something.

212
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,742
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's coming out in the fall.

213
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:20,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have, what was it?

214
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:22,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what was a really cool one here?

215
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:24,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here's one.

216
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:30,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo DS, SNK vs. Capcom Cardfighter.

217
00:15:30,392 --> 00:15:34,075
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming out on, looks like, October 2nd.

218
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that's awesome.

219
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:37,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Cartoon Network Racing

220
00:16:03,204 --> 00:16:04,224
[SPEAKER_03]: October 18th.

221
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, there's Dance Factory.

222
00:16:05,724 --> 00:16:07,545
[SPEAKER_05]: That game's been delayed forever.

223
00:16:07,645 --> 00:16:09,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it sucked.

224
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:10,865
[SPEAKER_05]: A game based on the movie Cars?

225
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:12,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what that is on June 7th there?

226
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's... Oh, what was that?

227
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:15,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Naruto.

228
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:18,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet a lot of our listeners that like anime want to know about that.

229
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:22,247
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually are bringing out the... I've known about this for a little while.

230
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:24,228
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bringing out one of the last Naruto games.

231
00:16:24,828 --> 00:16:26,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Naruto Ultimate Ninja.

232
00:16:26,448 --> 00:16:27,688
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out June 21st.

233
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:31,389
[SPEAKER_03]: What was a really funny one I saw here?

234
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:33,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that people might not know about yet?

235
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:36,837
[SPEAKER_03]: PS2, Yakuza, it's coming out September 13th.

236
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:38,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that was one that was pretty cool.

237
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:42,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of some really cool stuff.

238
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's coming out way later in the year there.

239
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish this was in order here.

240
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's a bunch of 360 games.

241
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:52,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Rising, I think the date's wrong on that, though.

242
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:53,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it got postponed.

243
00:16:54,003 --> 00:16:55,104
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't updated it yet.

244
00:16:57,344 --> 00:16:58,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Overgy Fighters, that looks kind of cool.

245
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Nova G Fighters is June 8th there?

246
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:02,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, June 8th.

247
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:05,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Splinter Cell, Double Agent?

248
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,229
[SPEAKER_03]: That's September.

249
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:10,630
[SPEAKER_03]: They got postponed a while back because they didn't think there was enough systems out there.

250
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Snoopy vs. the Red Baron, August 16th.

251
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,491
[SPEAKER_03]: We covered that one.

252
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

253
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:21,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so there you have it.

254
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:31,360
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, and this is, this stuff is all, you know, subject to change, I mean, a lot of stuff they announce way in advance and gets pushed back and back and back and back and, yeah.

255
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,203
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, I don't know, there's some, some good stuff.

256
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:42,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Mega Man ZX, um, coming out September 13th on the Game Boy Advance.

257
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:44,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

258
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,971
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, lots of exciting stuff.

259
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:48,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

260
00:17:49,628 --> 00:17:51,269
[SPEAKER_03]: More, of course, coming from E3.

261
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:55,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I mean, we might see stuff at E3 that, you know, wasn't on the Konami list.

262
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:56,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, absolutely.

263
00:17:57,051 --> 00:17:57,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there will be.

264
00:17:58,031 --> 00:18:03,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for example, we don't have any Revolution or PS3 titles in here yet.

265
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:05,674
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was nothing on Metal Gear 4, right?

266
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:09,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, we know Konami's planning, but they don't have a date for it yet, obviously.

267
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:09,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

268
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,077
[SPEAKER_03]: So, lots of stuff coming.

269
00:18:12,777 --> 00:18:15,979
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'll just keep an eye out on these dates.

270
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:19,340
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if we see anything good, I'll definitely, you know,

271
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:21,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep guys up to date on this stuff.

272
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sounds great.

273
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:27,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Skype line is open if anyone wants to give us a call.

274
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Most specifically about this topic here is what we want you guys' feedback on.

275
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:33,510
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about this whole news story?

276
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think we're full of crap?

277
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:38,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I hope by this point you don't, but if you do, then say so.

278
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:40,094
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll offer our witty retorts.

279
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:44,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we ruin E3?

280
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:45,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we did.

281
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:46,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we built hype for E3.

282
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,639
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, if anything, this...

283
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:56,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Who out there, I mean, other than probably us, actually goes to E3 looking to see what Konami's putting out?

284
00:18:56,366 --> 00:19:02,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know everybody's interested in all the companies and stuff, but, I mean, the big focus this year is going to be PS3, Revolution.

285
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:08,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the fact that we put out the dates, maybe if anything, kind of helped.

286
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:10,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

287
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:11,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only two weeks away.

288
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:15,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like, you know, it's not a huge spoiler.

289
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:16,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

290
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:25,096
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so no calls coming in on the Skype line right now, but our chat room is kind of a buzz here over at www.orangelantradio.com.

291
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:25,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on chat.

292
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:29,099
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Ranma says, Naruto GameCube sucks.

293
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:34,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Naruto PS2 owns, or I should say pones, so to speak.

294
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:40,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Knight wants to know, oh my God, they're going to port the Neo Geo Pocket game.

295
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if that's in reference to the Capcom SNK.

296
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Naruto 2 is coming out on GameCube October 18th

297
00:20:10,353 --> 00:20:11,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Current Gen stuff as well.

298
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:15,544
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be ported into PSP, PS2, Xbox.

299
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:17,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

300
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:20,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sounds pretty good.

301
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:21,937
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

302
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:31,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, since it looks like people are being shy in our chat room right now, not wanting to give us a call, we'll open up Skype line a little later for other topics if you guys want to call in and talk about that.

303
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:37,024
[SPEAKER_05]: But for now, we'll go ahead and move on and talk about our gaming week, how we usually start off the show.

304
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,105
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week?

305
00:20:40,385 --> 00:20:42,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Kingdom Hearts and lots of it.

306
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:44,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

307
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:48,829
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played just like I was so in a hurry to get past all the Roxas crap.

308
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:51,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear that's a fun part of the game.

309
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:52,162
[SPEAKER_01]: What's his face, the guitar boy?

310
00:20:52,182 --> 00:20:53,683
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a pain in the ass to beat.

311
00:21:20,257 --> 00:21:26,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing a lot of that, and not really much else, just because it puts me back in couch potato mode.

312
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:32,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a little bit of Ragnarok, but I was like, eh, I don't really feel like trying to get to level 50 today.

313
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:39,296
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really been about all I've been playing, is lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of Kingdom Hearts.

314
00:21:40,156 --> 00:21:42,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I hear it's a very time-consuming game.

315
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't touched my copy in a week.

316
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked a different name because I just wanted some anonymity on playing Final Fantasy XI.

317
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,638
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is a Skye on there, but it's a she and it's not me.

318
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:25,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a different name on there.

319
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:35,627
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've ran into a lot of really nice people on that server and some people that are helping me level my way to level 30 so I can get some of those advanced jobs because I kind of want to be a puppet master in Final Fantasy XI.

320
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:36,048
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll rock.

321
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:39,110
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as other games, I've been playing a whole lot of new stuff.

322
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I ordered Beatmania 2DX Nightstyle.

323
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:46,634
[SPEAKER_05]: like last week and I finally got it this week so I've been playing a little bit of that.

324
00:22:47,294 --> 00:23:02,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Beatmania's release here in the USA really got me back into playing that and outside of that I also decided to download Mutant Storm Reloaded, the game on Xbox Live Arcade after seeing it at Loki's house the other day and it's interesting because it's very similar to Geometry Wars but it's not.

325
00:23:03,203 --> 00:23:08,726
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the stages aren't all that same square and it's a pretty game but not in the same way.

326
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:11,288
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very sci-fi looking and

327
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:12,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Pulsing Cells

328
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:33,901
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

329
00:23:53,340 --> 00:24:16,330
[SPEAKER_05]: and that pretty much does it for my gaming week I mean Final Fantasy XI eats up a lot of my time I have other games that I'm waiting to try like Spike brought some games that he wanted me to try out and I got a copy of Oblivion but for the computer and I want to be checking that out pretty soon as well so one of my friends is letting me borrow his copy of Oblivion so that'll be good I wanted to add something what's that?

330
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,691
[SPEAKER_01]: I really really hate the Little Mermaid levels

331
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,022
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

332
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:47,457
[SPEAKER_05]: MiniMe283 says, I love that Penny Arcade comic about Kingdom Hearts 2.

333
00:24:48,137 --> 00:24:49,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I unfortunately didn't see that one.

334
00:24:49,877 --> 00:24:50,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping maybe you'd seen it.

335
00:24:51,138 --> 00:24:51,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have.

336
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:54,099
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Winnie the Pooh merging with Sephiroth.

337
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, I did see that.

338
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I did see that.

339
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was funny.

340
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,382
[SPEAKER_05]: So Sephiroth's in this one, too?

341
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:04,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and he's not, what's his face anymore?

342
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Lance Bass from NSYNC?

343
00:25:06,943 --> 00:25:08,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but...

344
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:11,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever is Aerith sounds like she's stoned.

345
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Mina Savari from American Beauty.

346
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:15,581
[SPEAKER_05]: She sucks.

347
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:16,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like her in that.

348
00:25:16,802 --> 00:25:18,302
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's going to be her in Advent Children.

349
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:20,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have rather had Mandy Moore in that saying something.

350
00:25:21,864 --> 00:25:25,365
[SPEAKER_01]: But she's like, oh, I'm on drugs.

351
00:25:27,285 --> 00:25:28,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to get high?

352
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:31,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what have you been playing this week?

353
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:34,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've been playing Mutant Storm Reloaded.

354
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:37,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that last night, and that was fun.

355
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:39,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting tangled here.

356
00:25:40,377 --> 00:25:42,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was also playing more Oblivion.

357
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:44,638
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really cool.

358
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:45,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm cheating.

359
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:47,279
[SPEAKER_03]: That's even better.

360
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I did an item dupe.

361
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,121
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have all the uber stuff now.

362
00:25:54,061 --> 00:25:54,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of neat though.

363
00:25:54,842 --> 00:26:01,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this really magic enhanced katana and I took off someone's head with it and it was cool.

364
00:26:02,464 --> 00:26:06,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Tried to kill a horse and people didn't like that very much.

365
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:10,212
[SPEAKER_03]: But, what else?

366
00:26:10,992 --> 00:26:18,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Rumble Roses XX, and... I've been playing with the photo-taking mode.

367
00:26:18,615 --> 00:26:21,676
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I did create a character, though, and it looked pretty cool.

368
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:27,399
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get much to start off with, but it's really neat how they do, like, the different... how customizable it is.

369
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:32,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I did make a character that looked like Miss Swan from Mad TV.

370
00:26:32,141 --> 00:26:34,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna say, you were telling me about Miss Swan.

371
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:35,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish you could have seen this.

372
00:26:35,982 --> 00:26:37,003
[SPEAKER_03]: That was hilarious.

373
00:26:37,803 --> 00:26:37,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

374
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:40,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the Ms.

375
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:47,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Swan character, all you have to do is basically take the default character that they give you and just make her fat and she looks like Ms.

376
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:47,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Swan.

377
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:50,394
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

378
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:52,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, what else did I do?

379
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:56,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually... Apparently...

380
00:26:56,886 --> 00:26:58,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Mario Kart GP.

381
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:02,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell you anything about it because I don't remember.

382
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:09,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Loki's bachelor party was last night and as part of it he got to go to Golf Land to play some Drunken Miniature Golf and some Drunken Mario Kart.

383
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:09,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there.

384
00:27:10,374 --> 00:27:15,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I filmed it and I think it's going to be going up on the website at some point or maybe the MySpace or something.

385
00:27:15,297 --> 00:27:15,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

386
00:27:15,978 --> 00:27:19,700
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to put it somewhere on one of those sites.

387
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,401
[SPEAKER_05]: We still need more people on our MySpace so maybe we ought to put it over there.

388
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:23,562
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll put it on both.

389
00:27:23,622 --> 00:27:24,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it on YouTube.

390
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:24,723
[SPEAKER_05]: It's

391
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:31,666
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole... Drunken A-hole from No Name Site plays Mario Kart Drunk.

392
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:33,567
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

393
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:39,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the best part was, you know how Mario Kart Arcade will take your picture before you start playing?

394
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:42,929
[SPEAKER_05]: The picture that you did was so friggin' hilarious.

395
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:43,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even describe it.

396
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,210
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are going to have to wait for the video.

397
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:45,710
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

398
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:48,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm converting the video tonight.

399
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:52,832
[SPEAKER_05]: JeremyTodd1 says, put it on olrpsp.com.

400
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:54,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, we're definitely going to be doing that.

401
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:55,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

402
00:27:56,992 --> 00:27:59,395
[SPEAKER_05]: The 23rd Magus says, We need a drunk show.

403
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:03,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to tell you, but probably not going to happen for a little while.

404
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,741
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be somewhere during our next three-day weekend.

405
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:06,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

406
00:28:07,023 --> 00:28:07,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

407
00:28:07,883 --> 00:28:10,807
[SPEAKER_00]: The next three-day weekend is... Memorial Day weekend at Fonamay.

408
00:28:10,927 --> 00:28:12,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're doing the panels at Fonamay.

409
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:13,509
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'd love to meet some of our listeners.

410
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and like...

411
00:28:15,473 --> 00:28:18,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the last really bad drunk show, I did get very sick.

412
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:25,980
[SPEAKER_05]: There will probably be some drinking at E3 Outpost, because I know we're supposed to be doing that with the folks over at AllGames.com.

413
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,843
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got the little E3Outpost.com, and they're supposed to have a bar, so that might be a good time.

414
00:28:31,063 --> 00:28:32,684
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me a happy bunny.

415
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:33,965
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

416
00:28:34,785 --> 00:28:37,567
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing is... I don't know.

417
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:39,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Last night was pretty bad.

418
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

419
00:28:41,627 --> 00:28:42,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really bad.

420
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,728
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your bachelor party?

421
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:46,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember half of it.

422
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:49,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's supposed to happen.

423
00:28:49,749 --> 00:28:55,671
[SPEAKER_03]: But, luckily, even though I can't remember it, we do have it on video.

424
00:28:55,711 --> 00:29:00,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to put the Mario Kart thing because I watched that today for the first time and I laughed my ass off.

425
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:01,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was hilarious.

426
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:03,833
[SPEAKER_03]: The face that it made was great.

427
00:29:05,474 --> 00:29:06,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're so funny.

428
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:07,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

429
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:09,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I was yelling at

430
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:11,632
[SPEAKER_03]: The Volcano, because I could.

431
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:19,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Milfululi says, and I totally butchered that name, sorry, says that we should put it on WikiQuote.

432
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:23,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I think Matt's WikiQuote got VFD'd today.

433
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:27,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's there anymore, so sadness, but no more WikiQuote for us.

434
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:32,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if somebody wanted to create one under Orange Lounge Radio, they might be able to get away with it this time.

435
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:32,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

436
00:29:32,444 --> 00:29:32,744
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

437
00:29:34,888 --> 00:29:39,771
[SPEAKER_05]: We're too busy converting videos or ourselves on wiki, but we know you guys love the wiki.

438
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:44,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, of course, I did play more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories.

439
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:46,114
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.

440
00:29:46,774 --> 00:29:47,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

441
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:53,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get into some news from a bunch of no-name websites out there that we want to share with you guys.

442
00:29:53,077 --> 00:29:53,617
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

443
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:54,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm totally kidding.

444
00:29:55,479 --> 00:30:03,527
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought we'd started off with this story tonight because I think this is very interesting and it's kind of a follow-up to this whole fallout that we were talking about earlier.

445
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:07,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And whereas people reacted to our news as, who?

446
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:07,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Who are these guys?

447
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:11,373
[SPEAKER_05]: This story comes from GameDaily.com.

448
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:14,595
[SPEAKER_05]: No one watches online video game TV.

449
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:22,318
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, it's this report that was done by Forrester Research.

450
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:31,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And the report found that 25% of online households have expressed interest in podcasting, but only 2% have experimented with audio downloads.

451
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:36,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And only 1% of households actually got a podcast onto a player.

452
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:50,972
[SPEAKER_05]: So podcasting is still kind of a very niche thing, and they're saying that, you know, when you consider that PodNova has 55,000 different podcasts available out there, it's still not really catching on.

453
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:52,893
[SPEAKER_05]: I still say it's too new.

454
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:57,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize podcasting, you know, it's a very trendy thing in the nerd culture right now.

455
00:30:58,176 --> 00:31:00,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's still going to be a little while before we see this catch on.

456
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:05,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I think videocasting, honestly, is where it's at, and, you know, I'd love to do a...

457
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.

458
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Something to think about there, online video game TV.

459
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:40,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys listen to any other podcasts besides this one?

460
00:31:42,018 --> 00:31:42,978
[SPEAKER_00]: I never have time.

461
00:31:43,198 --> 00:31:44,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even listen to this one.

462
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:45,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's part of it.

463
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I listen to a couple, but I wish I could listen to more.

464
00:31:48,102 --> 00:31:50,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like listening to my own voice, so I don't listen to our podcast.

465
00:31:52,265 --> 00:31:52,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

466
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:54,166
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just always been like that.

467
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:54,907
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a little weird.

468
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:55,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

469
00:31:56,228 --> 00:31:56,888
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, not your voice.

470
00:31:56,908 --> 00:31:58,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying it's a little weird to hear yourself bat.

471
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:00,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, you're weird too, but... Bite me.

472
00:32:01,071 --> 00:32:01,912
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, no...

473
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of get weirded out by that.

474
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,595
[SPEAKER_01]: I just never have any time.

475
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:12,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I've downloaded a few podcasts.

476
00:32:12,778 --> 00:32:18,004
[SPEAKER_01]: For people I've actually met at the podcast awards, and I've listened to a few others.

477
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:23,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to check out the ones that are out there, but I can't really dedicate any real time to it since I'm in school.

478
00:32:26,307 --> 00:32:29,070
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some comments in the chat room.

479
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,233
[SPEAKER_05]: VXJasonXV says, Video casting is for porn.

480
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:34,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Gives a little salute emote icon.

481
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:37,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, Bring back the OLR webcam.

482
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:39,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

483
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:39,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

484
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,263
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

485
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:46,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other folks in chat are talking about some of the other shows that they listen to.

486
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:53,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Some folks that listen to shows over at allgames.com or shows that are affiliated with all games such as Video Game Show.

487
00:32:54,735 --> 00:33:00,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Some folks saying they listen to Dignation, Dream Station CC.

488
00:33:01,138 --> 00:33:04,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they sent us something a while ago we played around Christmas time.

489
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:05,901
[SPEAKER_05]: So very interesting.

490
00:33:06,202 --> 00:33:11,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Overnightscape was one of the ones I was listening to off and on because I met the guy who runs it.

491
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:12,946
[SPEAKER_01]: He interviewed me at the podcast.

492
00:33:12,986 --> 00:33:14,166
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember I actually heard that.

493
00:33:14,186 --> 00:33:14,747
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

494
00:33:14,807 --> 00:33:14,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

495
00:33:15,814 --> 00:33:15,994
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

496
00:33:16,014 --> 00:33:19,115
[SPEAKER_05]: And you had an interview on the All Games podcast, didn't you, on Friday?

497
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:20,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, All Games Interactive.

498
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:20,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

499
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:21,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Good time?

500
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:24,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

501
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:29,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, like, in such a rush that day.

502
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:30,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what I was doing.

503
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:32,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

504
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,240
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

505
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,967
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

506
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,589
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that for defeating the odds?

507
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:02,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine still works too, but I don't have a first gen.

508
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I got mine a couple years after it was out.

509
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought my Japanese PlayStation 2 pretty much just for Beatmania.

510
00:34:07,651 --> 00:34:10,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked up a couple other games, but pretty much that's the only one that gets played on it.

511
00:34:11,812 --> 00:34:22,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's actually reporting from CNN Money, from Chris Morris at CNN Money, stating that the PlayStation 2's price is going to drop.

512
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:33,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's at $149, but now that the Xbox 360 is really staying there, it looks like they're going to be dropping the price by about $20.

513
00:34:36,382 --> 00:34:36,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

514
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:41,263
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, in light of all these new systems coming out, they're going to be a little more expensive.

515
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:46,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's, you know, formularic almost that these old consoles drop in price a little bit.

516
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:48,784
[SPEAKER_05]: So some folks who still don't have a PS2 will be very happy.

517
00:34:49,424 --> 00:34:50,465
[SPEAKER_01]: It's $20, though.

518
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:52,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if they really wanted to make it

519
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,572
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already made back their money.

520
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,253
[SPEAKER_01]: They should drop that thing to $99 and clear them out.

521
00:34:57,373 --> 00:34:59,314
[SPEAKER_03]: They just sell a hell of a lot of games that way.

522
00:35:00,195 --> 00:35:02,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard a rumor that they're actually talking $99 later.

523
00:35:03,097 --> 00:35:06,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe $99 will come at Christmas when PS3 is already out.

524
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:11,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who out there is going, Damn, I'd buy that PS2 if it were only $20 cheaper.

525
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:16,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Every dollar counts, though, if you're trying to budget out.

526
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:27,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everybody is into games enough to want to buy a GameCube, a PlayStation 2, and an Xbox, never mind the DS, the PSP, and all that other stuff, too.

527
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:30,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everybody is sick like we are and buys all those systems.

528
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:31,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everybody can afford it.

529
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:36,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I budget for those types of expenses, but not everybody can do that.

530
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:39,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Every penny counts.

531
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,931
[SPEAKER_05]: A penny saved is a penny earned.

532
00:35:43,012 --> 00:35:43,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, whatever.

533
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:48,389
[SPEAKER_00]: A penny saved is a penny that you already earned that you just set aside.

534
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,812
[SPEAKER_05]: A dollar saved is one you should send to me.

535
00:35:52,373 --> 00:35:55,136
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a phrase that I've never been able to get behind.

536
00:35:55,496 --> 00:35:59,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because a penny saved is a penny earned, but you've already earned it, so you didn't earn it twice.

537
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:01,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's up with that?

538
00:36:02,343 --> 00:36:03,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Pennies aren't worth anything anyways.

539
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:07,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you get behind the dollar saved is a dollar you should send to Orange Launch Radio?

540
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:11,716
[SPEAKER_01]: It already says in my intro to pump up the volume to send me a dollar.

541
00:36:12,176 --> 00:36:13,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Two people have sent me a dollar.

542
00:36:13,997 --> 00:36:14,498
[SPEAKER_05]: For real?

543
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:15,398
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that.

544
00:36:15,418 --> 00:36:17,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Two people have mailed me a dollar bill.

545
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:18,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the cut?

546
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:19,762
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

547
00:36:19,822 --> 00:36:20,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, where's our cut?

548
00:36:21,743 --> 00:36:25,767
[SPEAKER_01]: It was invested into the show to give me beer.

549
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:26,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, fair enough.

550
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:28,709
[SPEAKER_01]: That increases my entertainment value.

551
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, for those folks... That bottle of fat tire that's in my fridge.

552
00:36:34,628 --> 00:36:40,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, for those folks who are ready to graduate to the PlayStation 3 and can't freaking wait for it, what's the latest on PlayStation 3?

553
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you'll get to play it at E3 this year, which is awesome.

554
00:36:45,815 --> 00:36:46,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Except you've got to wait in line.

555
00:36:47,656 --> 00:36:48,156
[SPEAKER_03]: A long line.

556
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,557
[SPEAKER_03]: A very, very, very, very, very long line.

557
00:36:51,198 --> 00:36:59,102
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, yeah, it will be there, but it's going to be pretty much like the PSP was when they first showed that a couple years ago.

558
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:00,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Long line.

559
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:05,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony and Nintendo love to do the long line to play something.

560
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:08,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure this year Nintendo is going to have a long line to play The Revolution.

561
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a big surprise.

562
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:13,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully there will be some actual games there.

563
00:37:13,302 --> 00:37:15,923
[SPEAKER_05]: It gives it that exclusive club feeling to it in a way.

564
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:18,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to see the PS3 at E3 and you didn't.

565
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:20,765
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those things.

566
00:37:21,045 --> 00:37:22,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't wait in line for Zelda last year.

567
00:37:22,946 --> 00:37:35,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm crazy, but I just felt my three hours I could have waited in line to see Zelda or I could have actually taken time to really look at some of the things in Kenshiya Hall and there's some pretty good gems down there every year.

568
00:37:35,912 --> 00:37:36,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

569
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumor or fact on this PS3 thing?

570
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we don't really know until E3, right?

571
00:37:43,482 --> 00:37:46,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say probably fact because it makes perfect sense.

572
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at last year.

573
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:55,234
[SPEAKER_03]: They even went a step further at Microsoft's booth and they said, hey, you've got to be pressed in order to play the 360, bitch.

574
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:59,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So just because you deem it fact, then it must be fact, right?

575
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:01,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm speculating.

576
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:04,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pulling that completely out of my ass.

577
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:07,101
[SPEAKER_05]: You might remember a classic video game.

578
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:09,363
[SPEAKER_05]: We're jumping from classic to new, but this is classic.

579
00:38:10,043 --> 00:38:10,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of This World.

580
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:12,085
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember this game, Out of This World?

581
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:13,026
[SPEAKER_05]: It was released in 1991.

582
00:38:13,406 --> 00:38:16,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say it came out on the Sega Genesis was one of the systems it was on.

583
00:38:16,508 --> 00:38:20,411
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a game I never really got into, but I know it has a really cult following to the game.

584
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:31,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a really nice looking game and used 3D polygon really before it was... This was 1991, and we didn't really have PlayStation and things until...

585
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Nintendo, baby!

586
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:00,067
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the whole Sega Ages?

587
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:26,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess this isn't really a new thing to do, but I don't know.

588
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:33,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Something about this game in particular, seeing as it was more of a small title, it's kind of interesting to see this get re-released.

589
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:36,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the hell's my remade friggin' Blaster Master?

590
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:41,113
[SPEAKER_05]: You will get your remade Blaster Master when Jamie and I get our remade Guardian Legend.

591
00:39:41,153 --> 00:39:41,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

592
00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:42,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Drive-thru.

593
00:39:43,033 --> 00:39:45,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Borderbund, or was it Borderbund?

594
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:45,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Broderbund.

595
00:39:45,754 --> 00:39:46,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Broderbund?

596
00:39:46,194 --> 00:39:46,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Broderbund?

597
00:39:46,994 --> 00:39:47,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Broderbund?

598
00:39:47,394 --> 00:39:47,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Broderbund?

599
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:54,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Well-formed squishy buns?

600
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they even exist anymore?

601
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:57,447
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what else they made?

602
00:39:57,507 --> 00:39:57,847
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

603
00:39:57,867 --> 00:39:58,547
[SPEAKER_05]: The print shop.

604
00:39:58,868 --> 00:39:59,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the print shop?

605
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:00,149
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

606
00:40:00,169 --> 00:40:02,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Where you could print those huge, hideous banners on the dot matrix printers?

607
00:40:02,971 --> 00:40:04,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck yeah.

608
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:07,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would take like an hour to print your damn banners?

609
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:09,136
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had the green and white paper?

610
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:10,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that them?

611
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:12,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure that was them.

612
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:13,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to know what sucks?

613
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:20,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that my old computer lab at my college had dot matrix printers with the green and white paper.

614
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Comments from the chatroom, www.orangeillustrated.com.

615
00:40:25,141 --> 00:40:25,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on chat.

616
00:40:26,322 --> 00:40:28,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of celebration around Blaster Master.

617
00:40:28,903 --> 00:40:33,645
[SPEAKER_05]: 23rd Magus would like you to know Broderbund also did Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, which is another big title.

618
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:34,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they did.

619
00:40:34,925 --> 00:40:35,146
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

620
00:40:36,126 --> 00:40:41,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to another story, let's head on over to Loki.

621
00:40:41,788 --> 00:40:42,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

622
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:45,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we have some news on an Xbox Live Arcade game.

623
00:40:47,031 --> 00:40:49,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I have this game, yet have never played it.

624
00:40:49,352 --> 00:40:51,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it for free with one of those 12-month kits.

625
00:40:52,401 --> 00:40:52,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Bankshot Billiards 2

626
00:41:08,326 --> 00:41:09,847
[SPEAKER_03]: on his wonderful podcast.

627
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:36,431
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't look like it was something I had to own, but a lot of my friends list is playing it, so I'm like, what am I missing out on?

628
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:37,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like Yahoo Pool.

629
00:41:39,352 --> 00:41:40,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like billiards games.

630
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:44,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I only have this on my 360 because it's free.

631
00:41:46,014 --> 00:41:46,634
[SPEAKER_03]: That is it.

632
00:41:47,529 --> 00:41:47,929
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

633
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:52,813
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys like to send us e-mails once in a while over at www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

634
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:56,875
[SPEAKER_05]: You can send your e-mails to mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

635
00:41:56,915 --> 00:42:02,739
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you do so, Dark Sakura will dig through the e-mail and pull out some of her favorites and scold them on air.

636
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:04,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to wear a hazmat suit lately.

637
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:11,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And last week, Dark Sakura wasn't here, so we did some MySpace messages because people have been sending us messages on MySpace.

638
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:12,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did a couple of those.

639
00:42:12,646 --> 00:42:14,127
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need to catch up on some e-mails.

640
00:42:14,187 --> 00:42:16,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's have Dark Sakura get on the suit.

641
00:42:17,649 --> 00:42:21,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Dig in the mailbag and pull out some, hopefully not anthrax.

642
00:42:21,192 --> 00:42:22,513
[SPEAKER_05]: What'd you get?

643
00:42:24,214 --> 00:42:24,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Anthrax!

644
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:26,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Freeing the noise.

645
00:42:27,776 --> 00:42:28,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

646
00:42:29,678 --> 00:42:30,959
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one from Blaze.

647
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura.

648
00:42:34,381 --> 00:42:35,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is my name not first?

649
00:42:35,702 --> 00:42:36,222
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, gee.

650
00:42:36,803 --> 00:42:37,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch it.

651
00:42:38,043 --> 00:42:44,388
[SPEAKER_01]: After hearing the discussion about Kingdom Hearts 2 and the extremely slight chance of an MMORPG, I started thinking about it.

652
00:42:44,847 --> 00:42:53,935
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to avoid having everyone as a Keyblade holder, thus resulting in no bad guy characters, perhaps a movie could introduce an evil Keyblade allowing for a balance of characters.

653
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:54,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a thought.

654
00:42:55,417 --> 00:43:03,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I don't know if anyone still cares anymore, but Microsoft is seriously sending out their Xbox Live Diamond cards as fast as they were putting out the Xbox 360s.

655
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:07,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Sky, by the way, absolutely loved Need for Speed Most Wanted on my Xbox 360.

656
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:07,948
[SPEAKER_01]: How dare you bash it?

657
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:09,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't bash it.

658
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:09,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

659
00:43:11,404 --> 00:43:36,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I may have bashed it and said how horrible looking it is but I also said I couldn't stop playing it for like a whole week and I think that says something that you can have a sometimes there's it's the reason why when games are reviewed by people there's that fun factor that contributes really big to it that's outside of graphics outside of sound outside of all that crap there's fun factor and for whatever reason and I still can't put my finger on it I found that game to be so much fun

660
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:45,497
[SPEAKER_01]: On the subject of eating healthy while gaming, I will take a six-pack of Propel water.

661
00:43:45,537 --> 00:43:46,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to drink that stuff all the time.

662
00:43:47,117 --> 00:43:48,818
[SPEAKER_01]: And drink that instead of a bunch of soda.

663
00:43:49,038 --> 00:43:50,018
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I love the show.

664
00:43:50,078 --> 00:43:50,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good work.

665
00:43:52,438 --> 00:43:52,918
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good.

666
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,539
[SPEAKER_01]: But it got to be a little too sugary for me when I started cutting out a lot of sugar.

667
00:43:57,339 --> 00:44:02,060
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm drinking oxygen water, which gives you very clean breath.

668
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,501
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like a way to rip you off at the store.

669
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:07,281
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually was cheaper than the other waters, which is why I bought it.

670
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:08,002
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

671
00:44:08,462 --> 00:44:08,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

672
00:44:09,462 --> 00:44:10,002
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do we have?

673
00:44:12,036 --> 00:44:16,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, did you already cover the MySpace message from Joey?

674
00:44:16,379 --> 00:44:17,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that was last week.

675
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, fine then.

676
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I... Stealing my thunder.

677
00:44:21,362 --> 00:44:22,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, look, you weren't here.

678
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:23,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm kidding.

679
00:44:24,464 --> 00:44:25,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was in a coma.

680
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:27,846
[SPEAKER_01]: I was dead at the time.

681
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:30,388
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be back in a coma if you don't start reading some more email messages.

682
00:44:30,408 --> 00:44:31,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's rude to point.

683
00:44:31,488 --> 00:44:33,790
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to watch out or I'll kick you from chat.

684
00:44:36,772 --> 00:44:37,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

685
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:43,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey again, I didn't think you'd read my question on your show, let alone when there are two weeks worth of nails to go through.

686
00:44:43,524 --> 00:44:43,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks again.

687
00:44:55,495 --> 00:44:59,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone ahead and picked up Beatmania and have two observations and two questions about it.

688
00:45:00,919 --> 00:45:07,523
[SPEAKER_01]: One, despite being a hopeless, hopeless novice right now, I really prefer 7Key, the 2DX mode over 5Key.

689
00:45:07,964 --> 00:45:14,248
[SPEAKER_01]: The latter seems to only have three level one songs, while 7Key seems to have a better variety of songs suited for all skill levels.

690
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:18,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, you mentioned the overly colorful and techno-trippy interface.

691
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,311
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, what it reminded me of most was Amplitude.

692
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:25,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Although Harmonic's name doesn't appear on the game, I'm wondering how much involvement the team had on this one.

693
00:45:25,993 --> 00:45:26,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero.

694
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:26,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero.

695
00:45:26,953 --> 00:45:27,633
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all Konami.

696
00:45:28,394 --> 00:45:38,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami made this game the very first Beatmania was in 98, and I want to say the first 2DX was 2000 or 2001, don't quote me on that, but somewhere in that area.

697
00:45:38,597 --> 00:45:42,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, no wait, Beatmania was probably 97, because DDR first came out in 98, so...

698
00:45:44,693 --> 00:45:45,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Beatmania was 97.

699
00:45:45,734 --> 00:45:47,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Needless to say, they're old.

700
00:45:47,395 --> 00:45:51,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the emulator that was the thing at the time was BM98.

701
00:45:51,638 --> 00:45:52,979
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, that's right.

702
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have BM98.

703
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:55,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

704
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:55,622
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks.

705
00:45:56,222 --> 00:46:00,666
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't, because it has all of the neat... Like, the person who did the...

706
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:02,759
[SPEAKER_01]: The Metal Gear music.

707
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:03,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

708
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,680
[SPEAKER_01]: With the, oh no, the truck has started to move.

709
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:06,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

710
00:46:07,521 --> 00:46:12,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of amplitude and sort of frequency, is it possible to use the Beatmania controller with those games?

711
00:46:12,884 --> 00:46:15,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really tried it, but it seems to make sense doing so.

712
00:46:15,646 --> 00:46:16,086
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

713
00:46:16,366 --> 00:46:22,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it works because I don't, those seven buttons on your 2DX controller are not like circle, square, remapped.

714
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,971
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a completely different signals.

715
00:46:25,031 --> 00:46:25,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it works.

716
00:46:26,631 --> 00:46:29,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they should, I think Harmonix should have released a controller for those games.

717
00:46:29,573 --> 00:46:30,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would have been a lot of fun, but...

718
00:46:31,565 --> 00:46:32,766
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one.

719
00:46:32,926 --> 00:46:37,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, which of the songs on Beatmania US would you most like to see on DDR Supernova's eventual console port?

720
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:38,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Just curious.

721
00:46:39,051 --> 00:46:42,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. T and one of the club mixes of 20 November would be my pick.

722
00:46:42,474 --> 00:46:43,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate 20 November.

723
00:46:43,755 --> 00:46:43,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

724
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:45,636
[SPEAKER_05]: No, somebody in chat wanted me to say that earlier.

725
00:46:46,197 --> 00:46:48,679
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 November's okay, but it's not as great as people say it is.

726
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:50,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad Boy Bass.

727
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:50,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

728
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that song.

729
00:46:53,843 --> 00:46:58,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really not very excited about many of the things that are in Beatmania that aren't already on DDR.

730
00:46:59,793 --> 00:47:02,255
[SPEAKER_01]: There's stuff from 8th style I'd still like to see.

731
00:47:05,177 --> 00:47:11,901
[SPEAKER_01]: I still want to be able to play... Crap, now I forgot the name of the song.

732
00:47:14,103 --> 00:47:14,443
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

733
00:47:14,663 --> 00:47:15,003
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the...

734
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:18,470
[SPEAKER_01]: D2, Spooky, R-Love

735
00:47:44,017 --> 00:47:46,839
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've been wondering something for a little while now.

736
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:50,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been listening to you guys and Gal for about a year now as a podcast.

737
00:47:51,642 --> 00:47:56,725
[SPEAKER_01]: On a consistent basis, you guys seem to bring your classic and more often than not obscure games from the past.

738
00:47:57,206 --> 00:47:58,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I love, by the way.

739
00:47:58,646 --> 00:48:01,748
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question is this, when are you going to do a strictly classic gaming episode?

740
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:06,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I remember that being suggested in passing on a show right before you changed to the new format.

741
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:12,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of miss DarkSakura's tips section when I hear the music for the mailbag, but oh well.

742
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:20,444
[SPEAKER_05]: I would speculate we'll probably do that if there's going to be a show where we can't be here again.

743
00:48:20,524 --> 00:48:23,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a couple months ago, Loki had to fill in a couple weeks.

744
00:48:23,766 --> 00:48:28,889
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have time to pre-tape in advance, we'll probably do a classic game show next time we're all not going to be here.

745
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:34,593
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly, because of E3 and everything, none of us can really afford to all of us be gone.

746
00:48:35,734 --> 00:48:37,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you out next week, DarkSakura, for birthday?

747
00:48:38,076 --> 00:48:39,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm going to be...

748
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're out in two weeks for wedding, right?

749
00:48:43,495 --> 00:48:44,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so are you.

750
00:48:46,365 --> 00:48:47,546
[SPEAKER_05]: But is the wedding on Sunday?

751
00:48:47,566 --> 00:48:48,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

752
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:50,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought it was Saturday this whole time.

753
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:50,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, crap.

754
00:48:51,308 --> 00:48:53,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Then maybe there'll be one coming up sooner than later.

755
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,290
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll podcast your wedding.

756
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:56,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the day of Loki's wedding.

757
00:48:56,951 --> 00:48:59,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I joked about that, but yeah.

758
00:48:59,193 --> 00:49:01,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we need to plan on that.

759
00:49:01,374 --> 00:49:04,336
[SPEAKER_05]: So probably the day of Loki's wedding, since we can't do a show live, maybe we'll do that.

760
00:49:04,796 --> 00:49:05,316
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good idea.

761
00:49:06,057 --> 00:49:09,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe we can invite some other folks to talk about it, too.

762
00:49:09,399 --> 00:49:10,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fun.

763
00:49:11,556 --> 00:49:14,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's also another bit on this.

764
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,060
[SPEAKER_01]: When we mentioned Captain N, he brought up Kid Video.

765
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:23,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to watch Kid Video religiously when I was, what, seven?

766
00:49:25,626 --> 00:49:26,967
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I know Kid Video.

767
00:49:27,127 --> 00:49:29,869
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about a little garage band.

768
00:49:29,889 --> 00:49:31,330
[SPEAKER_01]: They get sucked into an animated world.

769
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:34,572
[SPEAKER_01]: It had the little pixie girl who would sneeze.

770
00:49:35,613 --> 00:49:37,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really crazy.

771
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:38,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember Kid Video.

772
00:49:39,475 --> 00:49:40,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember Kid Video?

773
00:49:40,196 --> 00:49:40,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

774
00:49:40,649 --> 00:49:41,130
[SPEAKER_03]: PUNCTUATION

775
00:50:06,633 --> 00:50:10,416
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a single punctuation point except at the very end of this email.

776
00:50:10,636 --> 00:50:12,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought I'd point that out.

777
00:50:13,198 --> 00:50:13,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a grammar nerd.

778
00:50:14,018 --> 00:50:14,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you are.

779
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:19,262
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me see if I can... I'm good at interpreting that stuff.

780
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:19,762
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.

781
00:50:19,962 --> 00:50:20,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm my mailbox.

782
00:50:20,843 --> 00:50:21,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

783
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:22,925
Meow.

784
00:50:24,866 --> 00:50:25,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

785
00:50:25,466 --> 00:50:26,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get right to the point.

786
00:50:26,347 --> 00:50:29,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I was listening to your podcast last week while you had the guy from Konami.

787
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:36,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my question is, I hear everybody talking about DDR Supernova, but for some reason it's like they skipped Flordia...

788
00:50:36,946 --> 00:50:37,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's Florida.

789
00:50:37,647 --> 00:50:38,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida.

790
00:50:38,928 --> 00:50:39,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Florida.

791
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:40,290
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's in Florida.

792
00:50:41,432 --> 00:50:41,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

793
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:43,734
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no release date or anything.

794
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:53,707
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys can give me a link or even some kind of update, I would be really grateful because I know a lot of people out there that don't know either and you guys wouldn't just be helping me but many people.

795
00:50:54,087 --> 00:50:56,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks and keep up the good work on Lounge Radio for life.

796
00:50:56,952 --> 00:50:57,833
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys will get it.

797
00:50:58,133 --> 00:50:59,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Every state's going to have it.

798
00:50:59,053 --> 00:51:01,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it wants to know when Supernova's coming out in Florida.

799
00:51:01,155 --> 00:51:03,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Supernova's coming out in Florida when Supernova comes out for everybody.

800
00:51:04,297 --> 00:51:09,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess the rumor was that they were taking orders for the first 50 machines and then it closed.

801
00:51:09,701 --> 00:51:13,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know how much to really credit all that.

802
00:51:13,563 --> 00:51:16,785
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say it was supposed to be out this month, right?

803
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,588
[SPEAKER_05]: So any day now, really, we should start seeing these machines pop up.

804
00:51:21,008 --> 00:51:24,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it'll really spread like wildfire until over the summer.

805
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:26,692
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to wait until summer for your local arcade to get this.

806
00:51:27,092 --> 00:51:37,420
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you live near a big city with a big arcade that has, you know, Hat Extreme and the other DDR games, this one will be coming as well.

807
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Just give it time.

808
00:51:39,382 --> 00:51:42,684
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we don't keep tabs on every arcade in the country, so we can't ask.

809
00:51:42,784 --> 00:51:44,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be afraid to ask your local arcade.

810
00:51:44,305 --> 00:51:46,647
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good way to show that you support it, too.

811
00:51:46,707 --> 00:51:47,328
[SPEAKER_01]: DDR Freak.

812
00:51:47,828 --> 00:51:49,409
[SPEAKER_01]: DDR Freak has a locations listing.

813
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:55,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that's put up there, being a moderator there, we regularly verify those to make sure...

814
00:51:56,174 --> 00:51:57,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

815
00:52:16,327 --> 00:52:26,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Just listen to Part A of the podcast, and I'd be genuinely surprised if the majority of those 50 launch titles weren't the NES Genesis TurboGrafx-16 downloadables.

816
00:52:27,415 --> 00:52:31,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I think he'll find out in Part B, I kind of corrected myself there.

817
00:52:31,998 --> 00:52:34,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I figured I'd go ahead and address this.

818
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:43,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we'll see as many as six full retail available titles to go with those, just out of curiosity and to compare how many Xbox Arcade launch games were there.

819
00:52:44,707 --> 00:52:46,168
[SPEAKER_01]: How many Xbox Live Arcade games were there?

820
00:52:46,568 --> 00:52:47,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say 10 to 15, because I can't remember exactly.

821
00:52:47,949 --> 00:52:49,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought a lot of them, but not all of them.

822
00:52:49,931 --> 00:52:54,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask Major Nelson, he'd know.

823
00:53:14,431 --> 00:53:16,211
[SPEAKER_01]: You say that and I keep thinking of I Dream of Jeannie.

824
00:53:16,832 --> 00:53:17,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

825
00:53:19,092 --> 00:53:22,073
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one says, Hey guys, doing a great job with the podcast.

826
00:53:22,413 --> 00:53:25,734
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite thing to do after work is to play World of Warcraft while listening to the show.

827
00:53:26,334 --> 00:53:26,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.

828
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, that's so cool.

829
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:31,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of World of Warcraft, did you... Alright, sorry.

830
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:31,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sorry.

831
00:53:32,116 --> 00:53:32,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

832
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:38,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I saw the most effed up video this week, and it was... The Lord of the Rings?

833
00:53:38,622 --> 00:53:41,022
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, the people crashing the funeral party.

834
00:53:41,383 --> 00:53:50,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, somebody... Okay, somebody, like, in real life passed away, and they were holding an online, like, funeral service for this... I think it was a she that passed away.

835
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:58,628
[SPEAKER_05]: And since it was on a PvP server, these guys had posted about it on a forum, and what happened is that... I think it was a Horde character.

836
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a bunch of... This whole big...

837
00:54:00,911 --> 00:54:03,761
[SPEAKER_05]: group on the Alliance side came to the funeral and killed them all.

838
00:54:05,447 --> 00:54:06,350
[SPEAKER_05]: That's horrible!

839
00:54:08,282 --> 00:54:35,752
[SPEAKER_05]: part of me is like that is so wrong but there's another half of me like the same half the same half that really likes South Park and that fucked up stuff that goes you know like and I know it's really wrong but that's let me put it this way it goes to show why I hate the PvP servers on World of Warcraft sorry to this guy if you're a PvP player whatever floats your boat I personally hate the PvP servers I had bad experience with PvP but anyway can I finish my email now?

840
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:36,612
[SPEAKER_05]: yes you may sorry

841
00:54:37,796 --> 00:54:39,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Rob!

842
00:54:41,598 --> 00:54:52,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Although this isn't exactly headline news like the red steel screenshots drool, I work for Philips and they're working on this new technology which sounds like something I've only dreamed about.

843
00:54:52,784 --> 00:55:03,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine feeling the rush of wind when jumping out of your plane in Metal Gear Solid 3 or having your sofa rumble and all the lights in your room flicker red when Sephiroth appears in the flames in Final Fantasy VII.

844
00:55:04,932 --> 00:55:19,180
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be really cheesy, but if the technology is really good and becomes widespread and developers start creating games with this in mind, along with how excited I am about the innovative revolution, the next few years could be huge for gaming and where it's headed.

845
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave a link to AMBX.com.

846
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:29,305
[SPEAKER_01]: I said there's some video on the site that gives you an idea of the lighting effects we're talking about, lightning strikes and all the lights in the rooms flicker.

847
00:55:30,154 --> 00:55:32,215
[SPEAKER_01]: A Plane Flies By and Creates a Rush of Wind.

848
00:55:32,255 --> 00:55:33,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, it's from dinky fans, but still.

849
00:55:34,176 --> 00:55:35,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't just for gaming.

850
00:55:35,376 --> 00:55:42,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Suppose it's for movies, music, PC versions of games are supposed to already be released this year, and console versions next.

851
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for this at E3.

852
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Think this will catch on?

853
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,361
[SPEAKER_01]: If not this, then technology.

854
00:55:46,401 --> 00:55:48,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this, revolution seems to be a step in that direction.

855
00:55:49,022 --> 00:55:49,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good work.

856
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:54,464
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use this, you can refer to me as Bear Who Drive Car.

857
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:57,346
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I actually didn't see that until the very end.

858
00:55:57,366 --> 00:55:57,926
[SPEAKER_01]: My apologies.

859
00:55:59,038 --> 00:55:59,378
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

860
00:55:59,418 --> 00:56:03,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, but it's ridiculous how much I want a goddamn DS Lite.

861
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:08,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I also agree with Sky, Final Fantasy XI is going to die shortly after Xbox 360 has released this expansion.

862
00:56:10,436 --> 00:56:11,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I did say... I said that.

863
00:56:11,797 --> 00:56:12,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I must have.

864
00:56:12,518 --> 00:56:13,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's gonna die.

865
00:56:14,019 --> 00:56:17,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's gonna... I actually think it's gonna... Oh, I remember what it was.

866
00:56:17,501 --> 00:56:21,564
[SPEAKER_05]: The comment was that I said the third expansion is gonna be the last one, probably, and then it will start to die off.

867
00:56:22,685 --> 00:56:25,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it'll be shortly, but I think, you know, in the next couple years.

868
00:56:25,947 --> 00:56:28,509
[SPEAKER_05]: There will always be crazies that play Final Fantasy XI.

869
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:29,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably I'll be one of them.

870
00:56:30,351 --> 00:56:32,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like there's crazies that still play EverQuest.

871
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:34,073
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know I use that term endearingly.

872
00:56:34,654 --> 00:56:34,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

873
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:41,129
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the popularity... You'll see server consolidations in a good two years.

874
00:56:45,215 --> 00:56:49,736
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing I want to comment on that, the whole room lighting thing, that technology has actually been around a while.

875
00:56:50,156 --> 00:57:01,319
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Commodore 64, I remember this, there used to be a program where you could have the Commodore 64 control the lights in your house for like when you're away on vacation or whatever, you could have the Commodore 64 regulating the lights in your house.

876
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not this huge... I think this is a little something different.

877
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:12,522
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I know, but they're saying that you want to change the lights red for when Sephiroth comes in and all this other lighting effects you can do in your house, right?

878
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it'd be more like an interactive station.

879
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:17,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

880
00:57:17,232 --> 00:57:25,095
[SPEAKER_01]: But they actually, there were things very similar to that, the previous E3s, like the, what was it called, the ass kicker or something?

881
00:57:27,016 --> 00:57:31,418
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing that you put under your chair and it makes, and you feel the bass in your butt or something?

882
00:57:32,679 --> 00:57:39,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that that thing was kind of cool, but you know, like it, especially for the music games or for some of the effects in the games...

883
00:57:41,685 --> 00:57:49,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, though, that having something immersive like that is going to be pricey, but I think it really would enhance the experience.

884
00:57:49,809 --> 00:57:50,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Be interesting.

885
00:57:51,249 --> 00:57:51,510
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

886
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:53,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

887
00:57:54,051 --> 00:57:54,691
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

888
00:57:54,711 --> 00:57:55,031
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

889
00:57:55,051 --> 00:57:58,673
[SPEAKER_05]: With all that, we're just one step closer to the holodeck from Star Trek.

890
00:57:58,853 --> 00:58:00,834
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where gaming will be in 50 years.

891
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,574
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be the holodeck.

892
00:58:02,611 --> 00:58:05,713
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had this conversation with somebody like a year and a half ago.

893
00:58:06,013 --> 00:58:08,295
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing our big Trekkie nerd discussion.

894
00:58:08,615 --> 00:58:12,038
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were talking about how holodecks are like the Nintendo of the future.

895
00:58:13,819 --> 00:58:14,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty.

896
00:58:14,139 --> 00:58:16,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Someday we'll do this show in a holodeck form.

897
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:16,901
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be amazing.

898
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:19,563
[SPEAKER_05]: You could, you know, sit on our laps during the show.

899
00:58:19,623 --> 00:58:20,163
[SPEAKER_05]: No, please don't.

900
00:58:20,243 --> 00:58:21,224
[SPEAKER_05]: That's violating us.

901
00:58:21,884 --> 00:58:22,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

902
00:58:23,546 --> 00:58:24,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

903
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:28,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have a contest to settle, do we not?

904
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:29,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps.

905
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:30,831
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

906
00:58:30,851 --> 00:58:31,251
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a

907
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,921
[SPEAKER_05]: You always keep them low.

908
00:58:57,961 --> 00:58:58,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do this.

909
00:58:58,801 --> 00:58:58,441
1, 2, 3, 4.

910
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:00,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's our winner.

911
00:59:00,943 --> 00:59:05,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Our winner is... I have to verify that they got two characters right here.

912
00:59:06,507 --> 00:59:08,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they said David Palmer and Edgar Stiles.

913
00:59:08,969 --> 00:59:10,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are indeed two people that died this season.

914
00:59:11,371 --> 00:59:14,193
[SPEAKER_05]: So say congratulations, everybody, to MiniMe283.

915
00:59:14,273 --> 00:59:17,035
[SPEAKER_05]: He won the 24 contest.

916
00:59:17,175 --> 00:59:17,855
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our chatters.

917
00:59:18,276 --> 00:59:19,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, one of our chatters.

918
00:59:19,456 --> 00:59:20,637
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it when the chatty people win.

919
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:21,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, MiniMe283.

920
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:23,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's actually, I think, eating right now.

921
00:59:24,819 --> 00:59:26,779
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's away and didn't even hear that.

922
00:59:27,379 --> 00:59:27,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

923
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:28,639
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well.

924
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,140
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be mini food.

925
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,701
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so DarkSakura, remember what they're going to win in that prize pack?

926
00:59:34,721 --> 00:59:35,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Will I forward this to myself here?

927
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:37,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

928
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:40,042
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the game and the shirt, right?

929
00:59:40,222 --> 00:59:41,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a bunch of stuff.

930
00:59:41,822 --> 00:59:42,623
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be good times.

931
00:59:43,143 --> 00:59:47,244
[SPEAKER_05]: So big thanks to our buddies over at 2K Games that are hooking us up with these prize packs.

932
00:59:48,584 --> 00:59:49,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.

933
00:59:51,126 --> 00:59:53,308
[SPEAKER_05]: People like to win free stuff.

934
00:59:53,328 --> 00:59:57,291
[SPEAKER_05]: They like to win free stuff so much that we're going to give away something else right now.

935
00:59:58,031 --> 01:00:02,074
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to give away also a copy of Amped 3.

936
01:00:02,674 --> 01:00:03,455
[SPEAKER_05]: For the 360.

937
01:00:03,515 --> 01:00:05,056
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, for the Xbox 360.

938
01:00:06,257 --> 01:00:07,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've played this game a lot, Loki, right?

939
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,219
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you do in this game?

940
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a basic snowboarding game.

941
01:00:12,221 --> 01:00:16,184
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, what kind of sets it apart is the way they kind of do the storyline.

942
01:00:16,484 --> 01:00:19,166
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done with sock puppets and just weird

943
01:00:19,858 --> 01:00:24,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, give me a number between 1 and that many times 10.

944
01:00:49,033 --> 01:00:51,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's go with 14.

945
01:00:53,937 --> 01:00:54,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's see.

946
01:00:54,937 --> 01:00:54,917
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

947
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:06,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the same person that won last?

948
01:01:07,006 --> 01:01:07,646
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think that is.

949
01:01:07,686 --> 01:01:08,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is a different person.

950
01:01:09,287 --> 01:01:10,568
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this one wins.

951
01:01:11,989 --> 01:01:15,432
[SPEAKER_05]: This goes to MikeG1Amp3.

952
01:01:15,992 --> 01:01:16,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

953
01:01:16,693 --> 01:01:17,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

954
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:19,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations to you, my friend.

955
01:01:20,374 --> 01:01:20,855
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a winner.

956
01:01:21,496 --> 01:01:25,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to everybody that participated, and we'll be doing more giveaways in the future.

957
01:01:25,884 --> 01:01:26,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

958
01:01:27,026 --> 01:01:27,286
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

959
01:01:27,747 --> 01:01:31,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to our next story, and that comes courtesy of me.

960
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:33,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XI

961
01:01:54,298 --> 01:01:56,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, April 20th, we're the secret secret character junkie.

962
01:02:19,417 --> 01:02:20,237
[SPEAKER_03]: will be available.

963
01:02:20,257 --> 01:02:20,677
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

964
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:23,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Junkie Horror will be an unlockable job class in the new Final Fantasy.

965
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:24,279
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be great.

966
01:02:25,899 --> 01:02:27,240
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll all be Mithras.

967
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:27,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine that.

968
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:28,841
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll all be Mithras.

969
01:02:29,141 --> 01:02:30,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they'd be Taro.

970
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:33,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I would play a Taro Junkie Horror.

971
01:02:33,562 --> 01:02:34,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be fun, actually.

972
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:35,583
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be a good time.

973
01:02:36,483 --> 01:02:36,824
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

974
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:38,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what do you got?

975
01:02:39,364 --> 01:02:44,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some info about the IEMA and VSDA merging.

976
01:02:44,847 --> 01:02:48,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, I always hear about the VSDA, just job-related stuff.

977
01:02:49,469 --> 01:03:04,277
[SPEAKER_03]: The Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association, basically the VSTA of video games, and the VSTA, the Video Software Dealers Association, who basically represent all the mass merchants, video specialty stores, etc.

978
01:03:04,998 --> 01:03:07,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now they're combined, so it's going to be one agency.

979
01:03:08,658 --> 01:03:12,641
[SPEAKER_03]: One place for all the interactive software sales and stuff.

980
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:26,132
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, they have to say, by coming together in one organization, the retailers, distributors of DVDs and video games will increase their collective power and the benefit from business acumen and product knowledge of one another.

981
01:03:26,773 --> 01:03:32,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's basically quoted from the chairman, VSTA chairman, Bob Geisman.

982
01:03:33,878 --> 01:03:35,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's pretty cool.

983
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,902
[SPEAKER_03]: That means I might have to go to VSTA this year.

984
01:03:37,922 --> 01:03:38,382
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

985
01:03:39,326 --> 01:03:45,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, they always throw a really cool show down in Vegas, so... Right about the same time as the porno convention.

986
01:03:46,788 --> 01:03:47,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Right next door.

987
01:03:48,148 --> 01:03:50,449
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think long-term effects of this will be on the game industry?

988
01:03:50,689 --> 01:03:50,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything?

989
01:03:51,129 --> 01:03:51,489
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

990
01:03:52,250 --> 01:04:08,194
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna see, definitely, you know, the IEMA and VSDA are gonna be, you know, ones saying, you know, hell no, we don't want these stupid video game laws, you know, ones that they're trying to pass limiting the sales of this stuff.

991
01:04:08,969 --> 01:04:09,269
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

992
01:04:27,543 --> 01:04:28,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero Peripheral

993
01:04:50,189 --> 01:04:55,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they've mapped different WAV files into the controller's buttons so that you press the button and it will start playing the loop.

994
01:04:56,054 --> 01:04:59,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you, because you've mapped the different sounds, you can sort of play different stuff on it.

995
01:04:59,157 --> 01:05:02,660
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like, well, I don't know, like... It's a MIDI sequencer.

996
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:05,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I was about to say.

997
01:05:06,563 --> 01:05:07,064
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um...

998
01:05:08,211 --> 01:05:12,453
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, even RedOctane kind of, you know, thinks it's pretty cool.

999
01:05:12,773 --> 01:05:19,336
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a quote here that says, we in Harmonix both are very much, I'm sorry, are both very much encouraged by this type of fandom.

1000
01:05:19,796 --> 01:05:25,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a game that a community like this thrives around is a great achievement, but it's the community that keeps it going.

1001
01:05:25,919 --> 01:05:26,479
[SPEAKER_01]: They're awesome.

1002
01:05:29,321 --> 01:05:31,842
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was actually a quote from John Tam.

1003
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that they endorsed the hacking.

1004
01:05:34,303 --> 01:05:35,724
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool of them, you know.

1005
01:05:36,304 --> 01:05:36,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,

1006
01:05:37,325 --> 01:05:45,108
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think that we're going to see more new innovation based on the fan community.

1007
01:05:45,948 --> 01:06:00,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I really see that a lot of game companies are not going to be as willing to experiment in depth, but when it comes from the fans and they see that there's a type of interest in this type of thing, it might turn on a few light bulbs and have the hamster wheels moving.

1008
01:06:03,955 --> 01:06:04,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to another story.

1009
01:06:05,974 --> 01:06:08,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Spike Lee, Inside Man, Inside the Inside Man

1010
01:06:36,735 --> 01:06:40,358
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's in the movie because they're trying to depict video games as violent.

1011
01:06:41,139 --> 01:06:45,943
[SPEAKER_05]: And Spike Lee is hoping that this scene doesn't actually get done in a future game.

1012
01:06:46,343 --> 01:06:53,790
[SPEAKER_05]: He explains, I just hope people understand that that is an absolute statement about my horror at how violent these games that young kids play are.

1013
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:57,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the infatuation with violence and gangster rap among the black community.

1014
01:06:58,234 --> 01:07:01,657
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a real game, but not that far-fetched from the games that are being sold.

1015
01:07:02,884 --> 01:07:06,507
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my thought that Spike Lee has decided to believe everything he sees on TV.

1016
01:07:08,269 --> 01:07:08,729
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1017
01:07:09,069 --> 01:07:10,330
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not violent enough.

1018
01:07:11,792 --> 01:07:12,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not satisfied.

1019
01:07:13,213 --> 01:07:13,934
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to see more?

1020
01:07:13,954 --> 01:07:16,316
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to see more violent stuff?

1021
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:16,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.

1022
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:17,477
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1023
01:07:17,837 --> 01:07:22,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Might I also point out Spike Lee has brought to you many different films out there.

1024
01:07:23,262 --> 01:07:26,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to think of some of these that are R-rated movies that he's done.

1025
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:29,667
[SPEAKER_05]: What is Do the Right Thing R-rated?

1026
01:07:30,187 --> 01:07:30,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

1027
01:07:32,455 --> 01:07:32,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1028
01:07:35,457 --> 01:07:37,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, USA, that was an R-rated movie.

1029
01:07:37,478 --> 01:07:39,579
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see, how about Malcolm X?

1030
01:07:39,619 --> 01:07:40,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that rated R as well?

1031
01:07:41,981 --> 01:07:42,821
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't doubt it.

1032
01:07:44,222 --> 01:07:46,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it was PG-13.

1033
01:07:46,143 --> 01:07:48,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Still not appropriate for children under 13, though.

1034
01:07:48,685 --> 01:07:49,846
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the idea here.

1035
01:07:49,886 --> 01:07:52,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kind of trying to be a smartass on this one.

1036
01:07:52,947 --> 01:07:57,710
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Hollywood puts out the violent stuff, too, so I don't really get it.

1037
01:07:58,231 --> 01:08:00,432
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like it's the pot calling the kettle black.

1038
01:08:01,735 --> 01:08:02,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack Thompson's Claim

1039
01:08:31,587 --> 01:08:32,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a second.

1040
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:32,828
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1041
01:08:33,108 --> 01:08:35,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I do remember a game where you shoved grenades in people's mouths.

1042
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:35,850
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1043
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:37,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaster Master.

1044
01:08:38,051 --> 01:08:41,333
[SPEAKER_03]: That fucking frog had it coming to him and he tossed grenades in his mouth.

1045
01:08:42,314 --> 01:08:42,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that.

1046
01:08:43,374 --> 01:08:45,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Spike Lee, you were beat by it quite a long time.

1047
01:08:45,796 --> 01:08:51,079
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's when you hit pause while it's exploding and then you wait like six seconds and unpause and it'll kill him.

1048
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, but still, it's been done.

1049
01:08:55,787 --> 01:08:56,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaster Master did it.

1050
01:08:57,128 --> 01:09:03,292
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think somebody should make a game that's like Kaboom, but instead it's just a giant mouth that's catching all these grenades falling from the sky.

1051
01:09:03,312 --> 01:09:04,113
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be great.

1052
01:09:04,793 --> 01:09:06,514
[SPEAKER_05]: What a perfect response to this article.

1053
01:09:07,015 --> 01:09:11,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Send a nice little care package over to Spike Lee and say, with love, the gaming community.

1054
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:13,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1055
01:09:14,299 --> 01:09:15,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of movies soon to be made.

1056
01:09:16,441 --> 01:09:19,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they're making a movie for Cold Fear.

1057
01:09:20,943 --> 01:09:23,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically a press release put out by

1058
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:42,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Works SA the leading French video game developer although I thought Ubisoft was the leading French video game developer but I could be wrong that they are I don't know they're putting out another movie that's going to probably be crap are they making it in French?

1059
01:09:43,501 --> 01:09:43,941
[SPEAKER_05]: or what?

1060
01:09:46,302 --> 01:09:52,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know to be honest I see video game movie for a game that I haven't played you know

1061
01:09:55,256 --> 01:09:56,797
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1062
01:10:22,442 --> 01:10:30,830
[SPEAKER_01]: actually Kingdom Hearts 2 hit 2.5 million it's actually approaching 10 million in the world it's pretty cool huh

1063
01:10:31,109 --> 01:10:33,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's a lot of sales.

1064
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:36,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but for Japan and North America, it topped 2.5 million.

1065
01:10:36,611 --> 01:10:44,414
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 1.2 million for Japan since December 22nd and 1.3 million in North America since the 28th of last month.

1066
01:10:46,555 --> 01:10:48,976
[SPEAKER_01]: This series worldwide has hit 8.5 million.

1067
01:10:49,796 --> 01:10:54,498
[SPEAKER_01]: With the European release, they're expecting it to top 10 million.

1068
01:10:55,878 --> 01:10:58,459
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, the numbers are well-deserved.

1069
01:10:58,699 --> 01:11:00,440
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is a very well-done game.

1070
01:11:01,069 --> 01:11:01,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

1071
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:04,115
[SPEAKER_05]: This game might sell that many copies.

1072
01:11:04,535 --> 01:11:05,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

1073
01:11:05,237 --> 01:11:10,847
[SPEAKER_05]: But Metroid Prime 3 is going to be the flagship title for Nintendo Revolution.

1074
01:11:11,348 --> 01:11:11,568
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1075
01:11:12,438 --> 01:11:13,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what they're saying.

1076
01:11:13,878 --> 01:11:18,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo is going to be showing this fully playable at the E3 Expo.

1077
01:11:19,379 --> 01:11:28,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm wondering if it's not Metroid Prime 3 on GameCube, but with revolution enhancements, sort of like they're saying is going to happen with, or would be happening with Zelda.

1078
01:11:28,841 --> 01:11:36,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a little more along the lines of what's really going on, is that Metroid Prime 3 is probably a GameCube game, but with revolution aspect to it.

1079
01:11:36,942 --> 01:11:39,423
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be very interesting, because this game kind of...

1080
01:11:40,223 --> 01:11:41,224
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1081
01:12:04,656 --> 01:12:05,436
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see what happens.

1082
01:12:05,597 --> 01:12:06,597
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be an exciting title.

1083
01:12:06,917 --> 01:12:12,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I really liked Metroid Prime 2 at last year's E3, but I never really... I mean, it's just my GameCube.

1084
01:12:12,401 --> 01:12:13,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be honest.

1085
01:12:13,201 --> 01:12:17,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't play it so much because there's not a lot of new titles I get really excited about on GameCube anymore.

1086
01:12:17,904 --> 01:12:18,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe with the Zelda.

1087
01:12:18,704 --> 01:12:19,005
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1088
01:12:19,825 --> 01:12:21,286
[SPEAKER_05]: One more story for this segment, Loki.

1089
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:22,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1090
01:12:23,227 --> 01:12:31,332
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you thought that you couldn't whore Burger King enough in 360 games, well, you're wrong.

1091
01:12:32,092 --> 01:12:33,273
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to actually make their own

1092
01:12:33,869 --> 01:12:35,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360 games.

1093
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:36,811
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1094
01:12:37,011 --> 01:12:42,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Burger King is going to be making games for the 360 and Xbox.

1095
01:12:42,894 --> 01:12:48,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they will be Xbox games that will be fully compatible with the 360 that we're going to be selling for $3.69.

1096
01:12:48,478 --> 01:12:55,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sure these will be top shelf games, too.

1097
01:12:55,422 --> 01:13:02,306
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be buying them with your Angus Cheesy Bacon Steakburger, which I might add, by the way, isn't very good.

1098
01:13:03,049 --> 01:13:03,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a very good game.

1099
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:08,010
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have three games that are going to be coming out, very appropriately deemed.

1100
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:10,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Action, Fighting, and Racing.

1101
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:21,613
[SPEAKER_03]: The action game, they're comparing it to Halo or Destroy All Humans, which will probably turn out more like Wolfenstein 3D.

1102
01:13:21,633 --> 01:13:28,154
[SPEAKER_03]: The fighting game is supposed to be combining elements of Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat.

1103
01:13:31,277 --> 01:13:31,817
[SPEAKER_03]: That's excellent.

1104
01:13:32,418 --> 01:13:33,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's the king gonna fight?

1105
01:13:33,699 --> 01:13:34,799
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know the king would be in it.

1106
01:13:34,819 --> 01:13:35,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's he gonna fight?

1107
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:36,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1108
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:36,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

1109
01:13:37,541 --> 01:13:42,685
[SPEAKER_05]: The evil... He could fight... He could beat the shit out of Hamburglar and Ronald McDonald and I think they might have problems with that.

1110
01:13:43,105 --> 01:14:00,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And racing is basically gonna be combining... Or they said it's very comparable to Need for Speed or Forza, which I'd laugh... They do have some... Or I should say Kotaku posted some screenshots or I guess...

1111
01:14:01,806 --> 01:14:02,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1112
01:14:02,386 --> 01:14:03,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Internal documents or something?

1113
01:14:03,546 --> 01:14:06,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that of concept art, I guess.

1114
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:08,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard they got in a little bit of hot water.

1115
01:14:09,228 --> 01:14:10,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

1116
01:14:10,408 --> 01:14:12,369
[SPEAKER_03]: But the screenshots are hilarious.

1117
01:14:12,509 --> 01:14:17,430
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like one that's looking like the king's trying to give a hamburger to some prostitute.

1118
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:20,211
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one where the king... Is that for real?

1119
01:14:20,251 --> 01:14:20,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1120
01:14:20,731 --> 01:14:22,511
[SPEAKER_05]: This shit has joke written all over it.

1121
01:14:22,551 --> 01:14:24,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a commercial or something.

1122
01:14:24,412 --> 01:14:25,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Marketing campaign.

1123
01:14:25,852 --> 01:14:28,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know, but... You know...

1124
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Sikoon suggests World of BurgerCraft

1125
01:14:46,886 --> 01:14:47,486
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be fun.

1126
01:14:47,886 --> 01:14:48,246
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

1127
01:14:48,587 --> 01:14:50,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Ota G says, Burger Combat!

1128
01:14:51,388 --> 01:14:52,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Plays a little music behind that, I'm sure.

1129
01:14:53,688 --> 01:14:55,709
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Poo Eater says, Clerk Killer.

1130
01:14:55,889 --> 01:15:00,551
[SPEAKER_05]: So the king could be fighting all the Burger King employees.

1131
01:15:00,631 --> 01:15:01,431
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be exciting.

1132
01:15:02,471 --> 01:15:02,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

1133
01:15:04,732 --> 01:15:05,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you know what?

1134
01:15:05,432 --> 01:15:07,073
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the BK Kids Club?

1135
01:15:07,133 --> 01:15:08,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the BK Kids Club?

1136
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:10,734
[SPEAKER_05]: That's who the king needs to regulate on.

1137
01:15:10,954 --> 01:15:11,594
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be fun.

1138
01:15:11,754 --> 01:15:13,355
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kick-ass.

1139
01:15:15,686 --> 01:15:17,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're gonna go to a break here.

1140
01:15:17,428 --> 01:15:20,352
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back a little later on with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1141
01:15:21,132 --> 01:15:26,098

1142
