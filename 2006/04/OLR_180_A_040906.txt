Tonight, April 9th, 2006, new screenshots from the revolution hit the internet, Xbox Live prepares for lots of new arcade games, and which Japanese company might be finding itself in big trouble this tax season?
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, Asian Bird Flu,
No, I don't know.
She has a really high fever or something, so she had to call in tonight.
So we hope you feel better soon, DarkSakura, if you're out there listening.
Secretly, though, I think she's just like... You know how when a really popular video game would come out, you'd stay at home, call in sick, and play hooky to play that game?
I think Kingdom Hearts 2 did that to her.
I think she called in sick to stay home and play Kingdom Hearts 2.
No, of course I'm teasing.
Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
You know what's funny is I feel like I'm actually Jamie right now because...
I'm sitting in a chair with a laptop.
I know, because you got your new laptop, didn't you?
Yeah, so this is weird.
And you did not buy a Mac.
I did not buy a Mac.
Despite the advice of our listeners.
Honestly, you've got to compare the specs, and then you see clearly that the way to go is the way I did.
Well, I'm not a fan of Gateway.
How does that feel?
I'm not a fan of Gateway either, to be honest.
But you know what?
This computer is at the right price and has the right specs.
To me, Gateway is merely the case it's in.
So, whatever.
Well, helping us out tonight, since we're one person short, we had to call on someone at the last minute and always prepared to lend a hand.
Say hello to Spike.
Hello.
How you doing?
I'm doing very good.
Good.
Good to hear it.
All right, he's feeling a little pressure a little bit because we literally asked him about an hour ago, hey, can you sit in and be a host tonight on a radio program on the internet?
But you've done this before.
You were here before.
It's always good times.
All right, yeah, you know a lot about games.
I know you don't really lead it on very much, but you know a lot about games.
You really do.
What was that Japanese game you're saying you're going to bring me next week that was some PS2 launch title?
Primal Image It's like, you know...
I don't know.
It's the best feature of the game because the game itself is very slow and boring.
But you said it reminded you of this game.
Well, yeah.
It's basically Pokemon Snap with half-naked virtual models.
And they go around doing their various poses as you circle around them taking photos.
And you get bonus points for the sort of more suggestive photos you take.
Very fun.
But they did not release this game in the U.S. ?
And Mischief Makers
No, I never played that.
Oh, you've got Dropjaw.
What is Mischief Makers?
I've never heard of this.
I've heard of Mischief Makers.
It's not as bad as it sounds.
What is it?
Tell me.
What is this game?
What are you doing it?
If I remember correctly, it's based off an anime, I want to say.
No, don't look like that.
It's not like that.
It's a good game.
It's an anime game.
All right.
Alright, we're going to go around and start this show off as we usually do with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week, where we go around and check in and see what we've been playing this week and what we like and what we hate.
Loki, what have you been playing this week?
I've been playing Far Cry Instinct's Predator, and that game's pretty, I don't know, long.
It's a fun game, you know, but then again, it's one of those games, like achievement-wise, if you're going for achievement points in this game, you might as well spend your time elsewhere because to beat the game, you get 10 points.
And you have to beat it in every single difficulty through both the Instinct storyline and the Evolution storyline.
And then do a bunch of other shit.
Where some of those Xbox Live Arcade games are like, You press the L trigger, you get 20 points!
That would be hilarious to have a game with a thousand achievements and each one's a point.
You know, like pushing direction up, pushing direction down.
That would be hilarious, but no, unfortunately...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know, so that game's kind of fun.
I did get Rumble Roses XX.
I did not buy Rumble Roses XX, just to make that clear.
I would not spend money on that game, unfortunately.
But I did get it.
I haven't played it, though, yet, because I got a laptop and haven't had a chance to waste time on that game.
But it looked interesting, I guess.
Right now, I've gotten pretty much every game for March, except for...
Blazing Angels, and that's the only one I don't have yet.
But I'm not really going to be buying games until June now, because I don't like Tomb Raider.
I don't really care for Top Spin.
Battlefield 2, never played it, don't really care.
And the stuff in May, you know, X-Men 3, maybe Time Shift, and MotoGP 2006 moved, and Rockstar's Table Tennis, no thank you.
I have to admit, my interest has somewhat peaked at Rockstar Table Tennis, I must say.
I've been playing, of course, more Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City Stories.
It's just fun.
Six months, I mean, now it doesn't get old.
It's just really fun.
The multiplayer is the best part, and I hope the god that has the multiplayer when it comes out on the PlayStation 2 version.
Instincts tell me, though, no.
It's not gonna.
Alright.
Anything else?
That's it.
Alright.
Spike, my friend, what have you been playing this week?
I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XII, XI, oh my god.
You're too eager for the XII, aren't you?
I am.
I want to play it so badly.
Which is a marked change from how I felt initially, but now all my time with XI has me really excited about that same base gameplay, but with a story.
See?
That's what I'm telling people.
To really appreciate the Final Fantasy XII demo, you must have had some exposure to XI.
Yeah, it's true.
I definitely agree with you now.
I'm also replaying Kingdom Hearts, the first game, to get ready for the second one.
And...
Is this because you're poor and you'll have to wait until it's a $20 game?
That's almost exactly why.
I'm just giving you a hard time.
But yeah, I put in 17 hours over that last week.
Dang.
And I forgot how much I hated the camera, but I really like everything else about the game.
That perfectly sums up my review of Kingdom Hearts, the first one.
Hate the camera, love everything else.
Yep.
So yeah, that's my week in gaming.
Awesome.
Let's see what I've been playing this week.
I just picked up Top Spin 2, the tennis game on the Xbox 360, which was the only Xbox 360 game I played at last year's E3.
So I think it has somewhat sentimental value to me because it was the only game that had no lines last year at E3.
No, I actually played it, instead of playing it at the Microsoft booth, I played it at 2K Games' booth.
and there wasn't nearly as many people there because they were kind of in a different spot so I got to play Top Spin 2 and I don't think I've played this game thoroughly enough to give it a good review yet I did notice like my first impressions were character creation whoa like okay it's it's right up there with Oblivion okay you know how Oblivion like will let you totally customize everything
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
What exactly did they do with that?
They did the whole... There was that skit that they did on Saturday Night Live.
Young Chuck Norris.
The whole song that goes along with that.
And he kicked and he punched and... It's really funny.
You gotta check it out.
I think it's on YouTube.
And they really... Just using the normal character creation, they made it really look like Chuck Norris.
And it was hilarious because he was beating up the shop owner.
It went through basically everything that was on the Saturday Night Live music video.
They just kind of recreated Oblivion.
It was pretty funny.
Awesome.
So besides the character creation, then I started doing career mode a little bit, but I found that I kind of sucked at the game because I didn't know what I was doing.
I didn't think the game had a very friendly tutorial mode or anything.
There was really nothing to tell me, press A to do a light bounce, press X to do a slice, and all that stuff.
And I would like a tennis game that's built for the retarded tennis player like myself.
Who is too fat to play real tennis.
Who might be able to benefit from knowing what a slice really is.
Assuming maybe I haven't played tennis before.
Okay, I know what it is.
But you know what I mean?
I would have liked something that really started me from an amateur level.
Whereas the game kind of threw me right in there and expected me to know stuff.
Even in the first training, it's like, okay, I've got to serve 10 balls.
And you're like, okay, what the hell am I doing?
It didn't really explain it for me.
So I actually had to open the instruction manual and read it.
I don't like having to do that with games.
Instruction manuals are dated things.
I don't ever read instruction manuals with games.
Ever.
I don't need them.
Usually.
But I needed it for this.
That made me a little sad.
But the graphics are really pretty.
I played a tournament in a Japanese cup or something and it was all decorated very Japanese style.
Totally stereotypical, but it was cool.
Um...
Besides that, I've been playing holdovers from last week, Beatmania, Kingdom Hearts 2, and I downloaded Feeding Frenzy, which is an Xbox Live Arcade title, which I guess came out a couple weeks ago, because I wanted a new arcade game, and Street Fighter 2 is still not available.
What the hell's with that?
I don't know.
Well, they had major lag problems that they had to fix.
A friend of a friend mentioned that there's major lag issues going on, and that's, I don't think...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And I think it's because Geometry Wars, and I really suck at Geometry Wars, but it has me skilled enough to dodge things really well using the analog stick, like using my sprite to dodge things.
And that's pretty much all Feeding Frenzy is, is a poor man's Geometry Wars with no shooter.
No, it's just, here's the thing I don't like about some of these Xbox Live Arcade games.
How about no trackball?
Because that game is way better with a trackball than it is a controller.
I didn't mind the controller, because I'm...
The game's okay.
I do like the fact that it saves your progress, because the game is kind of crappy.
I wouldn't want to have to go back and replay the whole game.
The thing, though, I don't like about it is that all these web games are getting ported over.
They're just Flash games.
Yep.
And let me take a moment to introduce the chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.
We do tape live every Sunday night to provide listener interaction.
We're one of the few podcasts that allow this.
It's awesome.
We love doing this.
And you guys get your input.
GK128 says in the chat room, Feeding Frenzy, free on the PC, $10 on Xbox Live Arcade.
And you know what?
You're absolutely right.
I'm a consumer whore.
There's absolutely no reason I should have paid for this except for...
The fact that as opposed to sitting in my little office chair and playing on the PC little screen, I like being able to plop my butt on the couch, you know, have my cup of tea or whatever I'm drinking that night, and play on the HDTV.
There's something to be said about that.
I mean, that's why I plan to get Final Fantasy XI in a couple weeks, which makes absolutely no sense because I already have it on the PC.
But I'm just that lazy where I want to plop on the couch and not have to move or anything and lay down and, you know, all that stuff.
Just...
Make sure you buy a USB mouse and keyboard.
Duh.
Well, X defers upgrading, so I think I'm going to steal that one and use it as the Xbox thingy.
Okay, I'm just saying, though, make sure.
Yeah, no, there's no way in hell I would play, and I would advise anybody out there that's going to get into Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360, do yourself a favor, buy a USB keyboard and a USB mouse, because you will be a sad, sad person otherwise.
Actually, you might be able to fake it without the mouse.
You could probably do it without the keyboard.
The mouse, yeah, the mouse, because I remember I didn't really use the mouse at all during the game, so the keyboard's fine, especially with all the shortcuts and everything, so that's not a problem.
And honestly, I already have a USB mouse that I use on my laptop, and it's wireless, so why not just take it and use it on the 360?
And the keyboard's good anyways because you can actually use it in other games, like, for example, putting in cheat codes in Far Cry and Sinks.
It makes it a lot easier with a keyboard.
There you go, there you go.
VXJasonXV says Street Fighter 2 is now on GameTap Magic Sword is now on GameTap Hello, like one of my favorite Capcom games ever
Any word on Black Tiger?
No, but VXJasonXV stays on top of that stuff more than I do, so he will probably be able to stay.
He did tell me King's Quest is on the way, though.
He saw in some movie thing on GameTap TV that King's Quest is coming, to which I said something about, oh, it's about time.
Let's see, other questions.
I noticed our chat room is playing Mario Kart DS tonight, so if you're trying to find friends for DS and you're listening live, go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com and click on chat.
and you can find some folks to play Mario Kart DS with.
I do see a lot of agreements for Mischief Makers.
HitStun in our chatroom says, Mischief Makers fucking owns.
And I quote.
So somebody knew what you were talking about.
Spirit Snare agrees.
Mischief Makers was indeed awesome.
That's because you guys have the best listeners.
We do.
We seriously do.
I love our listeners.
They're so awesome.
We've got a full chat room tonight.
I demanded last week that more people visit our MySpace and it worked.
We've like doubled our numbers on MySpace and people are actually leaving us comments now.
It's awesome.
I love you guys for doing that.
If you want to visit MySpace.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
All one word.
Hurry before they take MySpace down because of all the, you know...
The Nintendo DS is the new stalker system.
Your little girl might go on PictoChat and get raped.
I mean, seriously.
The hell was that?
That news is like two months old.
I would love to do that, just like, you know, do a little skit or something, like doing PictoChat and says, I'm going to rape you, and then have like a picture to go with it.
OLR TV.
Just save these ideas for OLR TV.
Okay.
Before you know who steals it.
Yeah.
But wait, I was going to say, the videos, speaking of which, you updated OLRPSP.com with videos, right?
Yeah, that was fun.
Including something that we purposefully cut out of last week's show because it didn't make the podcast because I had the giggles a little too much going into one segment, but DarkSakura had a lot to do with that.
But you taped the whole thing and put a video of it on OLRPSP.com.
Yeah, it was fun.
So more videos to come in the future.
Yeah, more videos to come in the future.
We can't say too much yet, but... Yeah, and I'm trying to... Well, the whole video thing was kind of an experiment because the PSP itself doesn't like downloading the videos.
It thinks it's a web page.
It's kind of retarded when you think of it because you have to save the link as.
So I've got to put some different instructions on there and work at it that way.
Well, we're learning now because we've got something big planned.
Yeah.
That's all I have to say.
We've got something big planned for like a month.
It's going to be huge.
Yeah.
Huge.
All right.
Let's get into some news, and we'll start it off tonight with Loki, and I got some news over there on the Revolution.
Oh yeah, they've actually had some screenshots of Red Steel, one of the games that's coming to the Revolution, leaked to the internet.
They're actually out of the new issue of Game Informer, the May issue, and you know what?
I'm starting to think here that the Revolution might be as powerful as some of these other systems out there.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You can do that too, which is really neat.
And use it also as a sword in the game.
But by the screenshot so far, I would say this looks pretty on par with even stuff like Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter, and even Rainbow Six Vegas.
It looks really good.
I'm really shocked, especially since they're saying that the specs aren't that great and stuff.
I think it looks really good.
This is a great comment from our chatroom right here.
Ota G says, Specs don't make a game look good.
Developers make games look good.
Exactly, and here's the thing too, and a lot of people, when they're looking at these, they're saying, well, you know what, just because the specs aren't as powerful, because they're not going HD, they can use that extra, you know,
and processing power to make it look even better.
Yeah, but Nintendo, can't you do a little HD?
Well, they're doing something.
They're doing 480p, so that's something.
Does that mean widescreen?
That's progressive scan.
I know what means progressive scan.
Does it mean I get widescreen too?
I think so, yeah.
Hooray!
So it's something.
And you know what?
I don't know.
They can change that later maybe.
I don't know.
But...
I don't know, it just looks really good.
Really good.
Alright.
Now, Spike, I saw these pictures in your live journal.
What do you think of Red Steel?
I'm really impressed.
I, as many others, I was really excited about the revolution for the gameplay innovation.
I had my hopes set on maybe we'd see games eventually that looked like Resident Evil 4.
I'm already like, wow, this is past that, and I'm really impressed.
I'm really happy.
The only issue I have with this, in looking at the pictures, I mean, the game looks pretty hot, don't get me wrong, and I'm really glad to see that Nintendo, you know, even if this is leaked out, I'm glad to see we're finally seeing something on the revolution.
My only hesitation is that I think a gun game using that controller is like the most cliche thing you could possibly do.
Although I agree with you.
It is a game being produced by Ubisoft.
Which, first off, you know, that's kind of expected, I'd think, from them.
But that says to me an even deeper message about developers are taking this very seriously.
They're not just, you know, making $10 shovelware ports for the revolution.
They're actually coming up with ideas and...
VXChaseNextV in chat says, Cliche, but it makes sense.
I suppose.
I mean, I just hope that... I want to see more like the demo with the chopping the vegetables thing.
Now, that was unique.
Are you looking forward to the next Nintendogs?
If it's like the DS one, I really hope they expand on it big time.
They announced 50 launch titles.
For real?
50 launch titles, 20 of which are going to be put out by Nintendo.
Where did you get this?
I haven't heard of this.
I don't remember where I read that.
Well, then I have to take it with a grain of salt if you cannot cite a fact.
That's what they're saying, though.
But if that's the case, though, you will see these innovative things.
But still, though, the thing about the revolution is, and they're trying to get away from the Nintendo being looked at as a kid system, a system that's meant for little kids, and that's it.
And that's what Microsoft and Sony want you to believe, is that the system is meant for
Well, something tells me this little game with the gun thing is going to dispel that pretty quick.
Well, I don't know, but it just looks good.
That's all I've got to say.
A Nintendo fanboy's answer to whenever a Microsoft or Sony fanboy presents them with that is Resident Evil 4, which usually is a GameCube fanboy's answer to everything.
When somebody tries to doggone... Resident Evil 4, bitch.
Resident Evil 4.
Resident Evil 4, bitch.
That's great.
I've said that exactly, actually.
Have you really?
I have.
I think everybody should use that in a sentence today.
Challenge yourself to tell a friend, Resident Evil 4, bitch.
Snakes on a plane.
Shut up.
Snake's on a Resident Evil 4...
Brain Age, Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day, which I'm really looking forward to trying out.
Even if it does have Sudoku in it, which I'm a little tired of, I think the rest of it will be pretty cool.
So I'm really looking forward to that.
So I want to try this demo.
And True Swing Golf is also another demo in there.
Now, I did a quick search in our area, and it looks like GameCrazy is the chain that's going to be carrying this a lot.
GameCrazy is the one that's in Hollywood Video, right?
Some Hollywood videos.
Some Hollywood videos have them, but not all.
But the one nearest me has one, and they have a download station, supposedly.
Best Buys are also going to be a huge chain that has them.
But again, that's just in my area.
Who knows where they are near you?
Head on over to Nintendo.com slash DSDownloadStation, all one word, to locate...
A DS download station near you And all you gotta do, you go into download play And they'll all come up right on there And you choose what you want to download And here's my tip, I learned this at E3 When they did something similar All you have to do, close your DS, put it in sleep mode You can take the DS home with you as long as you don't turn it off Demo's still there I did that with the Polarium demo last year for E3 Jesus, why?
That game was awful Sorry I liked it enough to buy it after the demo The only game I think I hated more than that Was Sprung
Otherwise, I thought Polarium was a waste of my time.
Now, now, what about Ping Pals?
Oh, that's not even a game.
That just burns in hell.
I gotta love that.
You gotta wonder if they were developing that game before.
I think so.
I think that was before PictoChat was announced.
And then when PictoChat was announced to be included, they were like, ah, fuck.
So that's why it's a bargain bin title now.
Seriously, you could probably find that game for like $5.
It's not even worth that.
Maybe $0.99.
Like, if you can find that game at $0.99 clearance center or the $0.98 store or whatever, then maybe it might be worth a look.
But otherwise, that game is of the suck.
It's a Dollar Tree special.
Speaking of the DS, when do the pretty new ones come out, Loki?
Hopefully soon.
And the estimated date is going to be around the same time that, you know, Mario, or the new Super Mario Brothers is coming out.
Anyways, according to the latest issue of EGM, they're reporting May.
And I think we reported May a while back too.
I don't remember what the source was from, but it looks like it's going to be May.
I mean, it makes sense.
It's right when this brand new game comes in and it would be a really good pack-in game.
So yeah, I think that's when it's going to happen, sometime mid-May.
Okay.
Didn't we kind of talk about that last week?
Like, theories were around on the internet saying that it's possible that the DS Lite... Well, first Mario Bros.
was pushed back, but then I read that that was actually wrong.
It got pushed back up.
It was a week.
They were kind of like... They've been volleying back and forth.
Yeah.
Like a game of Top Spin.
With the dates.
But now it's back to the 15th.
It's back to the 15th.
So we totally reported a false story last week.
Our bad.
But it's back now, and maybe for the DS Lite to come out at the same time.
Yeah.
They would have to announce that pretty soon.
That would have to be a big surprise thing at E3.
The DS Lite is coming out, and it's on store shelves right now.
Is that feasible?
They could do that?
Pull a Sega Saturn?
They could.
I'm trying to think.
Yeah, that would actually be the Monday-Tuesday after E3.
Yeah, that makes sense.
There you go.
Moving on, I've got a story for you guys in regards to Mario as well.
There's new postage stamps coming out in Japan that feature the Mario Bros.
sprites.
And it's 80 yen to get a 10 stamp sheet.
I'm sorry.
No, it's 80 yen is the value of the stamps.
And there's 10 of them, so it would be 800 yen to get one of these sheets.
And they're stamps, and they have things like the Cheep Cheeps, Mario, a Koopa, and then that horrible, horrible sprite of the princess.
It always looked to me like the princess had a buck tooth in that sprite.
I don't know if it's just me, but that's always the way I saw it.
It looked like she had funky teeth, like she was Princess White Trash.
I don't know.
Check that out if you're in Japan.
Or if you're not in Japan, check out eBay because I'm sure a lot of these are going to show up for collectors that want to get this stuff.
Super Mario Bros.
stamps.
Also in Revolution news, Zookeeper is going to be coming out for the Revolution.
Why?
This was from an interview in Nintendo Power, I believe is where this is from.
XBOX 360
I cannot fathom that they would release this game as a $39, $49 title.
And without some really freaking incredible bells and whistles, this game is not worth it.
Like, I'd rather see, you know, I'd rather see real animals falling down, not these, like, you know, tiles.
As a DS launch title, it was okay.
But for a Revolution title... It wasn't even a launch title, and it wasn't a very good title.
It's gonna be poopy.
However, this is what this makes me think.
Nintendo Revolution is going to have a service very similar to Xbox Live Arcade.
Yeah, of course.
Everybody's going to have a service just like that.
Well, I think this kind of just confirms that, and I bet you these old classic titles are probably fitting into that same scheme.
So not only are you going to be able to download classic titles, but probably these other games as well, all on the Revolution.
I couldn't cite you a specific source, but I'm pretty sure Iwata said something like that at a Game Developers Conference.
Oh, probably.
Yeah, he said something about like,
They're going to make titles that are going to be distributed via the virtual conference.
Oh, and I thought I dreamt up this little theory all by myself.
Oh, well.
Oh, well.
Rain on my parade.
See if I care.
Well, anyway, Zookeeper's coming to both those systems, and we do not care here at Orange Launch Radio.
Loki, I'm so glad we gave you this story tonight.
There's something going on in the Apple world, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Well, you know what?
Gaming, it's not really been a strong thing on the Apple and now with the Intel chips and the Intel Macs out there.
Basically, Apple, their response to gaming on the Mac is use Windows.
That's right, because the Mac is useless, so you have to use Windows.
Anyway, so you can use this program called Boot Camp that will let you install Windows XP without moving your Mac data.
and basically what it'll do is basically a dual boot in the beginning.
And you can run Windows XP and it'll run a lot of stuff on there, that's for sure.
A lot of games, I can't remember whether it's basically saying, but just a lot of the major games out there right now.
So definitely worth checking out if you want to play some games on a Mac.
You know what?
You can already play World of Warcraft on a Mac.
Which is usually... Hey, real games.
But not Final Fantasy.
No, you can't, no.
So, here's the thing.
Okay, first off, Macs do to do something.
On my iBook, I have made CDs and DVDs faster and prettier than I have on the PC and all that other stuff.
How do you make a CD prettier?
Just with all the pretty stuff that Apple makes for it to pretty-fy your CDs.
I've done it.
Like...
Pretty Sound... I don't know.
I'm thinking more DVDs, okay?
Like pretty menus and pretty things that I just could not do on the PC.
They were just too weird for me.
You couldn't do or PC couldn't do.
Look, shut up.
It doesn't matter.
My point is, I love my Mac.
Hey, listen.
Don't get mad at me.
Get mad at freaking Apple.
They're the ones saying use Windows, so...
That's not stupid.
That's smart.
Because now people are going to go, you mean I could do both on one system?
That's smart.
Good.
If you want to get a computer that's pretty, then that way you can run Windows and do stuff on Windows.
How is that not the perfect solution?
It's pretty and it does everything you need to do.
You know, that's just like,
That's just stupid, okay.
But whatever, okay.
If you're really confident that Mac OS X or whatever is great for, you know, doing your video and audio or whatever, and to be honest, it's only better for print media, okay, then great.
Use your Mac OS X for that and then use Windows for everything else.
Meanwhile, I'll use Windows for everything because, well, it can do everything that Mac OS X can.
So, there.
You're a jerk.
Let's move on to another story and this is interesting.
We always love gaming and politics stories.
There is a conservative political website out there that was actually defending gaming this week which I thought was very interesting.
It's nationalreview.com is the name of the site and they make some very interesting bullet points here.
He kind of
Adam Therer Of all the games that were reviewed by the ESRB in 2005, less than 13% were rated mature or adults only.
Over 80% were either E or T.
Every important social indicator has been improving in recent years even as video game use among youths have increased.
Aggregate violent crime by juveniles fell 43% between 1995 and 2004.
A quick glance at the back of any game box provides parents with plenty of information to make decisions for their families.
with most new video games costing between $40 and $60, it's likely that adults will need to be present when their kids purchase games.
So, kind of interesting there, coming from a conservative blog, which, I don't know, kind of is trying to set the stage that makes it look like liberals are for these gaming restrictions and conservatives are against them, but I don't really believe that because I've
Traditionally vote usually liberal, not 100% of the time, but usually liberal, and I certainly don't support it.
I think it's a lack of education on most politicians, and let's not forget, in order for these laws to pass most of the time in the states and everything, it's got to have bipartisan support, because usually you don't pass with just one side of the house, but that's just my... You've got to wonder how many of these actual lawmakers out there are just bored out of their mind, and they just want to go home, so they're going to agree to whatever you put in front of them.
No idea.
But yeah, it's kind of... It's like, another one of these bills?
Fine!
Just do it.
I want to go home.
And screw a hooker.
That's what politicians do.
Yeah, speaking of M-rated games in which you might be screwing hookers, Loki, there's some interesting statistics out there this week on M-rated games?
Yes, because Harvard, you know, because they have nothing better to do than...
Thank you for watching!
Basically, the report's conclusion was parents and physicians should recognize that the popular M-rated video games contain a wide range of unlabeled content.
No, actually, I think most of the content is labeled on the back there in that little label that says M and may expose children and adolescents to messages that may negatively influence their perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors.
No.
I think that it clearly says, you know, rated M for violence.
It doesn't say rated M for
104 violent deaths per minute or hour or whatever.
Why are they wasting our money on doing studies like this?
Seriously, I could look at a game and go, hmm, that's pretty violent.
When the game's called I'm Gonna Kill Your Fucking Mother, you probably can guess, hmm, it's pretty violent.
Instead of Happy Puppy Fun Time is not going to have freaking violent deaths in it.
Seriously, what's the big deal?
Why are they doing studies on this?
R-rated movies are bad, okay, because they have R-rated content.
Well, M-rated games are going to have bad content in them as well.
So it makes perfect sense.
Well, my thought is only 104?
That's child's play.
That's a low score.
Haven't you ever played Smash TV?
Do you know how many violent deaths occur in the scope of like two minutes when I'm playing Smash TV?
Like you tear through just people among people.
Have you seen games like Dynasty Warriors and 99 Nights and stuff like that?
I mean, seriously, you're killing thousands of people in like minutes.
I would like to know what games were sampled.
I mean, I don't know, and I don't really care.
All I know is... And did they, like, were you playing a game like, I don't know, like, I hate to use this as an example, but Driver 3, where, like, when I play, I aim for the people, and that's how I play Driver 3, is I purposely try to run over as many people as I can.
Shouldn't you be, like, trying to find a cure for cancer or something, other than doing, you know, stupid research like this?
I mean, what's this actually prove?
Wow, we knew what we already knew.
Great.
Give me my A. You know, seriously.
I don't know.
That's great.
I'm going over to the chat room, www.orangelongeradio.com.
Click on chat.
I think this is very funny.
Dark Tetsuya was responding to the whole like all the information is on the back of the box thing from the conservative blog.
And he says, yeah, but parents would actually have to check the back of the box.
Oh, that's right.
All the effort to rotate the box.
Why was I even thinking that?
Because parents don't have that kind of energy.
Let alone to watch kids and monitor what they do.
This is what I think is great.
Can I tell a story about my childhood and my mother from my childhood?
Okay, here we go.
When I was a kid, my mom would spend literally an hour at the video store reading the back of every single box of every movie that's new that week.
She's in the store.
She's going,
Do I want to rant this one?
Or do I want to rant that?
Oh, this one sounds violent.
I don't know if I want to get that one.
Oh, this might be, you know, she'll spend like an hour reading the back of every box.
And then like I'll, you know, take a game that I want to rant.
I'll walk up to her and I'll be all, can I rant this?
And she'll ask me, what's it about?
It's about fun.
Happy puppies.
I mean, can I rant Mortal Kombat 2?
What's it about?
People playing together.
Okay.
I mean seriously, yet in the same scope, I mean I love my mom, in the same scope she would spend like an hour reading the back of all the movie boxes and you know, she'd have to ask me what the game's about.
You know I was thinking like games like Smash TV, how many people do you think you kill in that game, you know, in an average minute?
Probably about 104.
I'd go more like 300.
Are you playing two-player or one-player?
Yeah, it depends.
And somebody in the chatroom, Dark Knight, mentioned the sequel, Total Carnage, which is probably twice as bad.
Exactly, and here's another thing, too.
If you're counting violent deaths, say I'm playing a Star Wars game or something like that, and I destroy the Death Star or something.
How many millions of people are in the Death Star?
I mean, that's really going to throw the statistic out.
Out there, so I don't know.
Does the AT-ST count for 30 deaths?
I think that's a good question.
And it should if it doesn't.
Oh, I'm so glad to know I'm not alone.
Fireboma in our chatroom says that's the exact same thing my parents did, Sky.
So I'm not alone in the world.
Good to know.
Moving on.
Just a friendly warning to folks out there.
There was a story.
Another study.
This was according to Reuters actually ran this study here.
I don't know if they conducted the study, but they actually ran it.
But they just want you to know, mature rated video games may contain mature content.
Did you?
No, here's the deal.
Pornos may contain sex.
No, here's the deal.
The study shows that a big black M on the front of the game may not be enough to show that there's violence, nudity, or whatever else is in the game.
Because it doesn't go into as much details as you might have thought.
Kimberly Thompson was the study's author.
She's concerned that parents might take this as a sign that the game is just peachy for kids, saying that
Parents should not interpret the absence of a content descriptor to mean the absence of content.
The study found that 80% of M-rated games included sex, violence, profanity, gambling, or drug and alcohol use, none of which was described on the labels.
This was ran by Reuters.
You know, Super Mario Bros.
3 contains gambling as well because you can get your power-ups, you have to match them, and that's like a slot machine.
Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?
I don't...
I mean, come on, why wasn't that rated M?
You know, here's another thing, too, I was wondering.
Maybe we should change our ranking system to NP for mature-rated games, not Peachy for kids.
I like that better.
Seriously, what do we need to have?
Like a person's decapitated head, you know, that says, this may contain violence.
Well, I didn't know!
I couldn't tell that the decapitated head meant violence.
I didn't know.
Maybe that's what we need to do is start putting little pictures on the thing.
Like, you know, a little decapitated head may contain violence.
A pair of titties may contain nudity.
Like, just write fuck on the box, you know, might contain profanity.
That one's...
Can you imagine what the cover of Grand Theft Auto would look like?
You know what I'm gonna say.
No, seriously, though, this is why we have to put on, like, you know, spray paint bottles.
Do not eat.
I mean, just because people out there are that fucking retarded that they can't figure this stuff out.
Seriously, if you're that dumb, you know, that you can't understand what the words mean, maybe you shouldn't be playing games.
Maybe you should learn how to read instead.
Fireboma would like to point out Kingdom Hearts 2 has blood in it.
Maybe it should be rated M for Slash.
Dark Knight is suggesting some other family-friendly games that parents could buy here.
Mary-Kate and Ashley get a clue.
That might be a good one for parents to play.
That'd be really good.
And then, of course, now they're talking about Super Mario Bros.
hacks, because somebody said Super Titty Bros., which I guess was really a hack that was out there, and now they're talking about all the other hacks.
Super Porno Bros.
Cracks out there.
Lame.
Everybody and their mother did a Super Mario Bros.
hack.
Speaking of hacks, we have a story on our old buddy Jackie Poo, right, Loki?
Yes, Jackie Poo.
And his modest proposal, part two.
Basically, he, I don't know what he has against Joystick and why he's reading so much of this website.
Because they'll report on him.
I guess, you know.
But anyways, he says, hey, how about a video game depicting killing of people who run Joystick?
I bet they'd be real interested in doing something about a certain game then.
Maybe they would feel how cops and women feel about Grand Theft Auto.
Oh, but that would require some actual thought.
And I forgot, you're all gamers.
So Joystick is running a contest now to design a game.
Yeah.
and stuff and it's to be honest it's real stupid and yes joystick I love that response joystick's response is to run a contest encouraging the deaths of joystick uh bloggers horrifically and the best one will win a prize or whatever it is I mean that's great I don't understand what this guy's problem is I mean seriously why is he going out to gaming blogs I mean that's like
Because thousands of people read joystick.
I read joystick, you read joystick, Spike, you read joystick.
Damn right.
That's three out of three right there.
100% of gamers read joystick.
100% of us don't care what he says either.
I know.
I mean, doesn't he understand that that's... See, did you like how I ran that study?
That's what other people do.
I said 100% of gamers read joystick because we all do.
So that's 100%.
You know... Send it to Harvard.
That should be our new tagline.
100% of gamers listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
Wouldn't that be great?
You know, I'm sorry, but Jackie Poo needs to seriously, he needs to do something.
He needs to get a hobby.
And because this whole, you know, holy crusade that he's going on is just ridiculous.
I mean, he's like the freaking Batman of the legal world.
I mean, he's,
He will not stop until he gets revenge with the people who killed people because they played Grand Theft Auto or something.
RavensDolphin in chat says, Orange Lounge Radio is next for Jack.
Look out.
You know what?
Hey, here it is, right there on the table.
If Jackie Poo wants to come on this show and have a professional interview, as long as he's prepared to answer the difficult questions, because we don't BS around, I will treat him with respect and dignity forever.
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Conduct yourself like a lawyer and not like a little kid.
Jack's latest tirades and such.
Well, they are wiping their ass with his name.
Literally.
That's mature.
Yes, in fact, if you want to buy some Jack Thompson toilet paper, they have it available on Jinx.com.
It's only $5.95 for a roll.
The question is, is it two-player or one-player?
That's a lot for a roll of toilet paper.
$5.95 at Target will get you like a 12-pack, at least, of toilet paper.
That's not a lot of ass to wipe there with the Jack Thompson toilet paper for $5.95.
But every time you use the bathroom, you'd come out smiling.
That's worth something.
Maybe I already do that.
You know what?
In case if that's not enough, they also have RIAA toilet paper, too.
Oh, goody.
Do I get a discount if I order them both?
I don't know.
I don't condone buying this because it looks like single ply and not very comfortable.
And our chat room is making all sorts of sophomoric comments that I'm not going to read out loud because it's about first grade humor level, but it is really funny.
And we're not?
It's really...
F.U.s of the Week
Yes, it's time for the FUs of the week.
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight since DarkSakura is absent.
FU to whatever made Jamie sick.
Yes, and fuck you.
I know this is typical of laptops, but my freaking crotch is on fire from this stupid laptop because this thing is so damn hot.
It's just not even funny.
Could somebody please wiki quote that?
My crotch is on fire from this laptop.
That would be awesome.
Thank you.
They're going to take me out of my page anyway.
Your wiki quote thing got queued for deletion, didn't it?
Yeah, it's because somebody out there is bitter.
It's not me.
I didn't do it.
Yes, I know it wasn't you.
Save the wiki quote page.
Actually, somebody suggested to move it to an Orange Lounge Radio wiki quote page.
And I like that idea because I want to get quoted once in a while too.
I say some pretty profound things in the show once in a while, don't I?
Don't I?
Don't I?
Yes.
Okay.
Save the wiki quote.
All right, anyway.
Yeah, that...
Typical, fuck you, slow drivers.
Because they're out there, they're out there in numbers.
And it seems like every time I'm trying to go someplace, you know, and get there in a timely manner, there's always someone that has to drive 30 miles an hour while, you know, sticking their hand out the window pretending it's like a fucking wing or something that they're flying a plane with their hand.
I'm like, fucking drive instead of playing with your goddamn arm!
So, you know, that's it.
Alright.
Spike, do you have any FUs that you want to give out?
Or are you in a good, happy, huggy, tree-hugging mood
The only F view that I can really think of, it's really minor.
I'm really bothered by the edits that Square Enix made to Kingdom Hearts 2 for a US release.
And they were talking in the chatroom about it, and you know, it's not really a big deal, and that's absolutely correct.
But it still seems pointless to me to change guns to not look so realistic in Kingdom Hearts.
Do that because Kingdom Hearts they think is more of a kids game because of the Disney element?
I would expect so.
I read on, I think it was Kotaku, but don't quote me on that, that it actually helped them to get a younger rating by changing the guns to look more cartoony.
But, I just, it bothers me that such a little thing could make such a big difference, you know?
We can't, like, stop, you know, 187 from, you know, people killing people, but...
My F.U.
goes to Konami.
and I realized that this show, if it weren't for DDR, we probably wouldn't be doing this show.
But seriously, Konami, fuck you this week.
You know why?
Because you are also in the business of making slot machines.
And those slot machines stole $60 from me at the casino the other night.
So F you, you makers of one-armed bandits that steal my money and don't give me any back.
Although I could definitely go for a Suikoden slot machine.
Correct.
Yeah, how about a Rumble Roses slot machine?
You know what?
Maybe that's a future list list we need to do.
A slot machine we'd like to see Konami make.
Does Konami do the fortune cookie one?
That one is hilarious.
It's the most racist slot machine I've ever seen.
The fortune cookie, and you play it, and if you get all the fortune cookies, then the guy who runs the Chinese restaurant comes up and goes, This is Mr. Lucky's Chinese... I'm like, it's the most racist thing I've ever seen in my life.
One of them.
And I'm just like, is that Konami that made that?
I don't know.
Oh no, if you win on my money, I have no money to buy rice!
It's horrible.
It's horrible.
I'm not making this up.
Go to a casino if you're over 18, 21, whatever the age is in your state.
Go to a casino and check out that fortune cookie machine.
And actually play it for a little bit.
It's bad.
Anyway.
Moving on.
Loki.
There is a sequel being made.
Finally.
After many failed attempts.
A game that I love.
Exactly.
Pilotwings.
It makes sense.
They're going to put one on the revolution.
But that's basically rumored according to EGM on the latest issue.
They had it in their rumor section, so it makes sense.
I would think so, especially with the remote, the revmote or whatever, and the way you would be able to use that in the game.
It sounds like it would be gimmicky enough to where they would do that.
Thanks for watching!
and you would have maybe a Smash Brothers and maybe Metroid and Pilotwings.
I'm trying to think what else.
Pokemon.
Pokemon Beatdown.
I still have a hard time believing that all these games are going to be out at launch.
Unless you mean by at launch, like the first six months.
That I would believe.
But 50 games, like the week the system comes out?
Hell no.
Hell no.
Well, I do think that, if anything, the first party games will be there because obviously they've been working on those the longest.
If Nintendo has 20 first party games out on launch day, I will do something crazy.
Give me something to do.
I will do it.
Well, let me see.
I can't remember if it's 20 games or 20% of the 50 games.
Oh, that's a little different.
That's a little bit different.
Now we're changing our story, aren't we, a little bit?
I remember the number 50, 50 games, but 20% of them.
How about $50 for 20 games that will be available in the first month?
I think that's more realistic.
I don't know.
We'll just see it at E3.
Rub myself in $340 worth of pudding, says DJ Poo Eater.
How about this?
Maybe I won't go for $340.
However, if Nintendo puts out 20 games on the launch day, it has to be on the day, otherwise it doesn't count.
If Nintendo puts out 20 days, I will get a six-pack of those Jell-O pudding things and rub it all over myself live on air.
Can we take photos?
Yes, can we take photos?
Awesome.
Take video.
Alright, you can do a video and put it on our PSP.
But remember, Nintendo has to release 20 games on the launch day, and it's not going to happen.
So I can feel comfortable saying that.
Alright.
To which our chatroom is having a little bit of a scary thought there.
What, did DarkTetsuya have a better idea?
What did he say?
Would you say Spike in the chatroom?
DarkTetsuya asks, will you go straight?
If I would go straight, you know, I think the person I'm seeing will have a big problem with that.
If I went straight suddenly over a stupid bet.
I think he'd laugh.
250 jello shots.
I'll die.
No, we'll do Rob's Puddin' Adventure and put it on OLR PSP.
Remember, it's got to be 20 games.
19?
Doesn't work.
21?
Maybe I'll get 7.
Well, wouldn't 20% of 50 be 10 anyways?
Wouldn't 20% of 50 be 10 anyways?
Yeah.
So how about 10 games?
It would make for compelling radio.
I don't know.
See, 10 might be realistic to me.
How many did they have on GameCube at launch?
They only had like 4 or 5.
On the day the system came out?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Xbox 360 got a new demo this week.
It's the demo for Tomb Raider Legend.
It hit the store and was on Tuesday, April 4th is when that demo went to the store.
The Marketplace.
I keep saying the store, but the Marketplace.
I actually went and I downloaded it and it sucked.
I didn't like it at all.
It's pretty.
But not pretty enough.
I thought the framerate was not where it should be for an next-gen system.
I felt the gameplay feels about 10 years old, like an old Tomb Raider game.
And I was bored, and I didn't even finish the demo.
I thought it was craptacular.
Didn't like it, not gonna buy the game.
And I thought the controls were crap, too.
It doesn't feel fluid to me.
Unless something big changes between this demo and the final release, I am in no way interested in Tomb Raider Legends.
Loki?
I watched someone play the game and I did like some of the details that they had in, like the water effects looked pretty cool.
I thought the water effects were crap.
Did you get to a point where you were like behind the waterfall and the camera would get behind the waterfall?
It looked like crap.
It looked like a bunch of snow, like white snow on the screen.
I didn't see that.
But anyways, I did like the smoke coming out of the guns, even though it looked kind of blocky, but still kind of neat.
And the voice acting, I guess, was okay.
But I don't like Tomb Raider, period.
And so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Gizem in our chatroom says, bah, on the Tomb Raider, hey, I like the demo.
Hey, to each their own.
I'm sure there's people that disagree with me.
In fact, I know there are.
In reading some websites and things, there's people that disagree with me.
I didn't like it.
I just didn't get what the big deal is.
Didn't sell me on it.
Sorry.
Maybe it's just not my kind of game.
I don't know.
I'm not huge on the platformers anymore.
I used to like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro and those type of games, but I don't know how huge... But that's not true, because Mario I still like and those types of things.
So I don't know what Tomb Raider's problem is, but I didn't like it.
Sorry.
Moving on to another story.
Loki!
Lots of stuff going on with Oblivion this week, right?
Lots of controversy and things?
Yeah, lots of stuff.
There's more like it.
They had this stupid... I don't even know why the hell anyone would buy this, but they had this stupid thing that they put on the marketplace.
It's a horse armor pack.
And I remember talking about this a while back when they announced this.
And it's basically just like it sounds.
Horse armor pack.
But it's not different stats or anything, right?
I guess your horse is armored now, a little bit.
Here's the thing.
It costs you money, first off.
200 Microsoft points, which is, I think, about $3.
And you have to buy the armor in the game.
You don't just get the armor.
It just makes it available for purchase.
Oh, so you don't even get the armor on your horse automatically.
You still have to work for it in the game.
Yeah.
That's crappy.
And...
To be honest, it looks stupid.
So basically, I'm paying $2 for a graphic file that's probably 400 pixels by 400 pixels that's going to be laid around my horse in a shapely way.
That's what I'm paying for.
I'm paying for a sprite.
You're not paying for a sprite.
You're paying for a polygon model.
Oh, sorry.
But still, yeah.
Same difference.
I don't know.
I think it's stupid.
Then again, I know enough people obsessed with Oblivion that they're probably excited about this.
There, you're at the town.
I mean, you don't have to ride a horse anywhere.
It's not required.
So, who cares?
And besides, I heard there's a part in the game where you can actually get a horse that is armored or, like, undead or something, and it basically can't be hurt anyways.
So, what's the point in getting a horse armor anyways?
You know what, though?
For all of this common sense... And you're not going to show it to any of your friends anyways because the game's not on live, so...
Who cares?
For all of this common sense, though, I saw on LiveJournal at least 20 people who had talked about purchasing this pack as a positive thing, as buying upgrades for so small amounts of money being a good thing in the direction that gaming is going.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Well, it's tough, because Halo was even weirder, because the maps were free, but you could buy them three months in advance for so much amount of money.
That was always kind of weird to me, too.
But a lot of things on the original Xbox would be free, like additional maps and things on different games, and costumes and things.
The only things that I remember paying for would be songs in DDR, which to me is a little different, because you're really adding to the game...
by getting brand new songs to play and step charts and everything, but I don't know.
Maybe people would disagree with me and say that's a waste.
The reason why they charged what they did for this is because Cameo, they have the new costume things, and that's what they charge for their costumes, so they took it as an example to charge that for it.
Well, that's kind of crappy, too.
I'm excited.
Cameo's retarded in the fact that you can download costumes that do nothing other than reskin the character.
But you can dress like Killer Instinct characters.
Who cares?
Who cares?
That doesn't make Cameo better.
Including Orkut.
Nothing would make Cameo better.
Yes.
Well, that's kind of cool.
But I'm still not going to pay for that.
I'm not going to pay for that.
Horse armor.
Seriously?
I don't know.
Why would you need horse armor anyways?
I have a hard enough time killing somebody that's a human, let alone a horse.
What else have they modded in Oblivion lately?
Other things that they've modded in Oblivion.
Well, like most things that have to do with the PC, they have released a topless mod.
That's right.
Your Oblivion characters, or female characters, can go wild.
And they have this patch out there.
Apparently...
All they've done is remove the clothing.
This skin was already in there, so I guess you can kind of almost say, Oh, no!
It's, you know, a hot coffee mod type thing without sex.
But, yeah, pretty much there's really nasty, ugly people because, of course, any character you generate with the character generator is ugly that are naked.
So, really nasty, ugly, naked people.
Enjoy.
Enjoy.
Why is it whenever there's a game that comes out, somebody finds out a way to make the lead character naked?
I mean, always, without fail.
You want to hear something funny?
This is a great story.
I don't know.
Do I?
This is about Tomb Raider, and about how it might be delayed.
Apparently, and this is why here, there is a certain scene in the game where, I'm not sure if it's Lara Croft or if it's one of the other sub-characters that's in there, but
Thanks for watching!
So popping out would not be good.
Gizem says, OMG, I need the PC version now.
Fat, fat, fat.
Laser123454321 says, Girls Gone Wild in Oblivion.
Fireboma says you can be like that guy who was wanking off to World of Warcraft.
Oblivion, I think it's great that they have a PC mod thing so you can actually mod PC versions.
But that's another thing, too, is then why would I want to buy the horse armor mod for the PC if I can just mod it for free?
I don't know.
All right.
Moving on, we're going to go to another story here, and it's actually a contest.
That's right.
We are giving away some prize packs from 24 The Game.
We were kind enough to get passed along some prize packs for 24 The Game.
We're going to give it away on tonight's program.
and all you have to do is send us an email.

Any two people that have died in season 5 of 24.
Random extra number 1 and random extra number 2, that doesn't count.
You have to give me names of actual characters, okay?
Main characters.
Or even supplemental characters will work.
Because main characters is a little vague.
So it's got to be somebody that has a name.
Let's put it that way.
So random extra.
Like if you saw the episode where people were dropping like flies at CTU, then work.
Unless you can name me specific people that were involved in that.
Good luck.
Excellent.
Good luck.
By the way, in segment B, we're going to give away an Amped 3 prize pack.
So stay tuned.
It's awesome.
It's a great game.
All right.
Moving on, let's go to another story.
We have an open letter from Sony Online Entertainment to PC Gamer Magazine.
This was kind of interesting.
Sony Online Entertainment actually wrote to the magazine.
You may remember that PC Gamer Magazine said they were no longer going to accept ads from gill sellers and gold sellers and other types of currency sellers.
They were not going to put this in their magazine.
And Sony Online Entertainment wrote this letter.
And Joystick is actually where I got a copy of this letter from.
You can check it out over there.
In this letter they were saying that these companies that sell these and the farmers that usually accompany their services have been as much of an issue for our company as they are for your readers, the people who play online games.
Over the last few years the problems associated with the secondary market have impacted Sony Online Entertainment greatly.
Blah blah blah blah blah, gold farmers are evil, blah blah blah blah blah.
But this is the part of the letter I think that's interesting.
We have taken substantial steps towards solving these and other problems, as well as balancing the desires of those who wish to engage in legitimate real money transactions by launching Station Exchange in EverQuest 2.
We will continue to develop innovative solutions in the future.
So in other words, what they're saying is that selling things for money is bad unless it's us doing it.
Right?
It's bad, okay?
As long as we get a cut, it's good.
Does anything strike somebody funny there about that?
Isn't there a weird inconsistency there?
I mean, couldn't they have just left that part out in their little letter?
The little plug for their service for selling things?
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Just my thought.
All right.
Questions on the 24 Contest coming from the chatroom.
Fireboma asks, does it have to be from this season?
Yes, they have to be from Season 5 for the 24 Contest.
Jack24 at OrangeLunchRadio.com News story.
Loki, IGN, what did they report this week?
They reported stuff that I reported weeks ago.
Basically saying that Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam is going to be a Revolution launch title.
I reported this back when we had the Activision list from the Destination PlayStation event.
So blow me, IGN.
I reported that weeks ago.
Where were you?
Maybe you're the source.
Well, that'd be surprising to me since they didn't mention a source, so yeah, it could possibly be.
But, hey, what do you expect?
Another launch game, Tony Hawk, cool.
Alright.
One more story for you guys, this segment of the program, and it has to do with, oh, who doesn't love Bob Ross?
I
I love Bob Ross.
I remember Bob Ross from when I was a kid.
I mean, who doesn't love a white man with an afro?
Come on.
Unless he's Napoleon Dynamite.
Bob Ross was awesome.
Bob Ross was totally awesome.
And Bob Ross is actually...
and DarkSakura.com
Whoever owns the rights to him now, they contacted him and they said, the press release is not a joke, but the side effect of people thinking it might help us get noticed.
But they really are going to make a game for the DS and the Revolution to teach you how to paint your own happy little tree.
I am so excited.
I can't draw for shit, but I will pick up these games.
Why don't they release this for the PC, too?
Using a stylus or something?
Those tablet things, because I know Jamie bought one of those.
She paid good money for those tablets.
I don't think enough people own those, but I think it's a good idea.
Who knows?
My question is, is this the next logical evolution of a Mario Paint type game?
That's a very good question.
I mean, we haven't seen Mario Paint on any system lately, and I'm kind of surprised we haven't seen it on the DS yet.
Doesn't Mario Paint seem like a totally logical idea for the DS, especially with the whole dual screen thing?
I mean, you could be painting on the bottom screen, and the upper screen could be showing coordinated music or animation.
I mean, let's face it, Mario Paint for the Super Nintendo, it kind of sucked.
I mean, a lot of us have fond memories of it, and the things that were in Nintendo Power.
I remember Nintendo Power had a little guide, and you could create your own little things from it, like the musics and the animations.
It would show you how to do it step by step.
But in the big scope of things, you could only really do nine frames of a small animation.
That's really shitty.
I mean, we have fond memories of it, but it really wasn't that great.
Now, I think a game like that could be pretty awesome, especially with, hello, Wi-Fi.
I could beam things across.
This could be like the evolution of PictoChat and maybe a way to commercialize PictoChat and get a little money off it.
Because think about Mario Paint could be like something you could chat with people online.
I wonder if they're going to include PictoChat as part of the revolution.
Possibly.
Over the internet.
Who knows?
But then are we going to get close to PictoRape that we were talking about earlier?
Oh, you mean like... Well, no, because you know Nintendo would say everybody has to be on the friends list.
They have to be your friends list.
People.
Did you know in Metroid you can't voice chat with people unless they're your friends list people?
Oh.
Yeah.
So that whole like, ooh, voice chat.
I have maybe like two people on my Metroid friends list and I haven't really played Metroid lately because of all these other damn games that have come out.
So...
I wonder if Bob Ross and his happy little trees, they'll probably be M-rated, you know.
Yeah, because of the fact that I might be able to paint a penis or a vagina in this game, which is likely to be the first thing many of you try to paint.
Would it be a happy little vagina?
It would be a very happy little penis or vagina.
Does this game have to be rated M because of what you can do with your imagination?
I don't know.
Can you imagine some parent suing Bob Ross Foundation or whatever over this horrible, horrific game?
My kid painted a penis!
And on that note, I think we're going to go ahead and go to our break.
So stay tuned.
We'll come back at you a little later with Part B of tonight's show.
