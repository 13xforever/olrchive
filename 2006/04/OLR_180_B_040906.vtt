Now the conclusion of this weekÃ­s episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.480 --> 00:26.480
And we're back here live on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 180 for this April the 9th of 2006.

00:26.480 --> 00:31.480
Loki would like to begin this segment with a small correction, wouldn't you, Loki?

00:31.480 --> 00:36.480
Yes, I would. Yes, about those numbers about the Revolution launch title, I was a little off.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.480
A little?

00:37.480 --> 00:39.480
Yeah, I was a bit off, okay.

00:39.480 --> 00:47.480
Actually, coming from Gamefront, the true number is 20 titles, one third of which are said to be developed by Nintendo themselves.

00:47.480 --> 00:52.480
so I was close I had the number 20 in there and there's a percentage

00:52.480 --> 00:56.160
which means Orange Lounge Radio will be Puddin' Free

00:56.160 --> 01:00.200
for those who listen to Part A thankfully. Damn. Hooray!

01:00.200 --> 01:03.920
My dignity is spared another day. Still better coverage than IGN

01:03.920 --> 01:07.320
Can I say that? I don't know

01:07.320 --> 01:11.360
Moving on, if you can address those cards and letters too. What is your email?

01:11.360 --> 01:13.560
You don't have an Orange Lounge Radio account do you? No. We need to get you one.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.720
We'll get you one. Remind me to hook you up with one after the show. We'll hook you up with a spike

01:16.720 --> 01:20.120
at Orange Lawn Radio email. I'll take you up on that. Alright, sounds good.

01:20.120 --> 01:23.480
Now, in the first segment, did anybody notice in the first segment of tonight's show, not a single

01:23.480 --> 01:24.920
story on Sony PlayStation?

01:24.920 --> 01:28.520
Because everything's been quiet on the PS3 front this week pretty much, hasn't it?

01:28.520 --> 01:32.000
Yeah. Well, there was one little thing, right, Loki?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.420
Yeah, let's see here.

01:35.420 --> 01:39.600
Basically, according to some French

01:39.600 --> 01:44.360
radio show, there was an interview done where it was leaked out,

01:44.360 --> 01:53.360
I guess that the Playstation 3 would be somewhere between the price point of 499,599 euros in the UK.

01:53.360 --> 02:00.360
So everyone's speculating, oh my god, it's going to be 650 dollars, 700 some dollars here, not the case.

02:00.360 --> 02:09.360
Actually a lot of times the price point over there, they will get screwed over because their price point will be, for example for the Xbox 360,

02:09.360 --> 02:16.280
I believe their price point is 399 euros for the premium system, whereas we were $399.

02:16.280 --> 02:23.100
So maybe $499 to $599, I'm thinking more about $499, that's probably going to be the price

02:23.100 --> 02:24.680
point in the US.

02:24.680 --> 02:27.720
I think $499 is a reasonable price point for the US too.

02:27.720 --> 02:30.640
I thought it was very interesting though, because this news kind of came out early in

02:30.640 --> 02:35.680
the week, and A, people ran with this saying that PS3 price announced, and first off I

02:35.680 --> 02:39.000
was thinking, okay, no, price was not announced.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.920
Some guy made an inadvertent comment that may or may not even be the truth.

02:43.920 --> 02:51.680
I know that this guy was a Sony exec or whatever, but with all due respect to Europe, Europe

02:51.680 --> 02:56.120
is not where the magic is happening right now in regards to PlayStation 3.

02:56.120 --> 02:59.240
The magic will happen there soon enough, but that's not where the systems are being made.

02:59.240 --> 03:04.400
Had this slip come from Sony in Japan, maybe I would have been a little more apt to believe

03:04.400 --> 03:05.400
it.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.640
But then how people suddenly made this direct conversion of Euros to dollars.

03:08.640 --> 03:12.240
right and completely disregarded the fact that usually the UK folks get

03:12.240 --> 03:15.320
screwed when it comes to price I'm very sorry you guys it's just the fact you

03:15.320 --> 03:19.680
guys kind of get screwed so sorry not always though sometimes they get games

03:19.680 --> 03:24.120
around the same price but a lot of times they do get screwed and you know that

03:24.120 --> 03:27.960
means that usually the amount that we pay in dollars they pay in euros is

03:27.960 --> 03:32.660
usually about the conversion so I think you're right $4.99 to $5.99 is more of a

03:32.660 --> 03:37.960
realistic point but again we've got the revolution and the 360 to compete with

03:37.960 --> 03:43.860
and unless you can sell me that I cannot live without blu-ray I don't think it's

03:43.860 --> 03:47.920
realistic to release your system for $5.99 unless you can somehow convince me

03:47.920 --> 03:52.460
that blu-ray will change my life do my dishes walk the dog and the whole nine

03:52.460 --> 03:57.880
yards this yeah I mean the system looks great I'm you know graphically it looks

03:57.880 --> 04:04.280
awesome gameplay we don't know we don't know we don't really know anything yet

04:04.280 --> 04:07.760
well just talking about the titles that they've announced so far they don't seem

04:07.760 --> 04:14.460
It's it's you know, the same game Microsoft's playing. Let's make the games prettier and not change anything because hey it worked before

04:15.100 --> 04:16.660
so

04:16.660 --> 04:21.900
Yeah, but take a game like oblivion oblivion could not have been done on the regular Xbox

04:21.900 --> 04:25.460
I mean not all it's it's so vast and it's so pretty

04:25.460 --> 04:31.500
I mean that's really a next-gen game right there. Did you spend much time with Morrowind?

04:31.500 --> 04:39.500
Not a lot, but I'd seen it. It felt the same game, just not as pretty.

04:39.500 --> 04:44.500
But if we're talking about gameplay, I wouldn't argue that there's a big difference there.

04:44.500 --> 04:51.500
Alright. Oblivion feels really big, and with everything that they're saying you can do with it, and just all the vastness.

04:51.500 --> 04:59.500
One part I didn't see in the other game was, I didn't see character creation. Was it as thorough in that game? I don't know. Maybe it was.

04:59.500 --> 05:03.060
I seem to recall that it was. It's been, you know,

05:03.060 --> 05:07.660
a good minute, but I do think so. I'm sure people in our chat room will be able to

05:07.660 --> 05:09.980
help out there. Orangelaunchradio.com. Click on chat

05:09.980 --> 05:13.100
if you want. Okay, so

05:13.100 --> 05:17.100
whatever. Moving on.

05:17.100 --> 05:21.420
One thing you will not see on the PlayStation 3 is anything coming from

05:21.420 --> 05:24.260
Lionhead Studios, that's for sure. You know why?

05:24.260 --> 05:28.780
Microsoft bottom. Yes, they announced earlier this week that the folks who

05:28.780 --> 05:35.340
made black and white and fable they just got bought by Microsoft that would be

05:35.340 --> 05:40.500
lion head studios so those types of games of course it's not really too

05:40.500 --> 05:44.820
surprising when you consider that fable was such a treasured Xbox game and a

05:44.820 --> 05:50.260
Xbox exclusive as well but who knows what that could mean for Xbox's future

05:50.260 --> 05:55.180
Loki what do you think about that news yeah yeah whatever Microsoft is

05:55.180 --> 05:59.620
absorbing companies now, so, Spike?

05:59.620 --> 06:04.100
I feel similarly about this, about how I feel about their acquisition of Rare.

06:04.100 --> 06:10.180
They make one pretty trophy title a game every year or two, but overall I don't see Alty

06:10.180 --> 06:15.020
Lionhead as a big, you know, industry-changing, challenging force.

06:15.020 --> 06:19.740
But it only takes a handful of those trophy games to sell your system, ask Nintendo.

06:19.740 --> 06:22.620
That's a very valid point.

06:22.620 --> 06:28.540
Although, I don't really count Fable as a very great game.

06:28.540 --> 06:33.700
The only reason Fable was so freaking great was because there wasn't anything else like

06:33.700 --> 06:35.380
it on the Xbox.

06:35.380 --> 06:39.700
Go over to Playstation 2, Gamecube, you got plenty of games like Fable.

06:39.700 --> 06:44.260
Although, to Fable's credit, it was a little more expansive than most games in the way

06:44.260 --> 06:46.020
that you could control your character's fate.

06:46.020 --> 06:49.780
Not that we hadn't seen it before, but it was so fluid and it was such a turning point

06:49.780 --> 06:53.200
of the game, I don't think you really saw that in the other systems.

06:53.200 --> 06:58.020
But you're right, the gameplay itself was kind of butt-mashing, was the fighting, you

06:58.020 --> 07:02.180
know, it wasn't anything that revolutionary, you know, but it still was really the only

07:02.180 --> 07:06.020
game like it on the Xbox, and for that reason.

07:06.020 --> 07:08.460
And I would argue the same thing is happening with Oblivion.

07:08.460 --> 07:12.940
I think the only reason Oblivion is doing so phenomenally is it's got no competition

07:12.940 --> 07:17.580
on the 360 right now, nothing, there is no game even remotely close to what Oblivion

07:17.580 --> 07:18.580
is like.

07:18.580 --> 07:22.460
wrong I'm sure it's a great game that would be good even if there was

07:22.460 --> 07:27.300
competition but still I think the only reason why I see half my friends list

07:27.300 --> 07:30.980
playing this game is because I know my friends a lot of them are into

07:30.980 --> 07:36.460
role-playing games there's nothing else for them to play on 360 right now yep

07:36.460 --> 07:43.520
just my thought all right let's go on to another story Loki what's this about the

07:43.520 --> 07:48.500
Xbox Live Arcade it's getting some new games that's for sure starting off here

07:48.500 --> 07:57.040
with Cloning Clyde, which sounds pretty weird, but basically they're keying this as it's

07:57.040 --> 08:02.220
going to be a completely unique 3D adventure and puzzle game that may bring a new meaning

08:02.220 --> 08:04.300
to the word schizophrenic.

08:04.300 --> 08:10.820
So basically Clyde was an ordinary but slightly dim guy before DupliClone Inc. paid him $20

08:10.820 --> 08:16.880
to take part in a cloning experiment, and I guess, you know, things go crazy from there.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.580
And so, yeah, it's going to be coming to the live arcade.

08:20.580 --> 08:28.060
It is made by a company called Ninjabi, who you might remember did Outpost Clokey X, which

08:28.060 --> 08:34.860
is a pretty big hit on Xbox Live, so, you know, check it out when it comes out.

08:34.860 --> 08:38.100
I think I read somewhere this is supposed to be the Geometry Wars.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.100
I don't think so.

08:39.100 --> 08:40.100
The next Geometry Wars.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.380
I think every Xbox Live title is going to call itself that though.

08:42.380 --> 08:44.360
The next Geometry Wars.

08:44.360 --> 08:48.880
trended over its geometry wars is simple that's you know what it comes down to

08:48.880 --> 08:52.280
you know what the next geometry wars was was crystal quest because I swear those

08:52.280 --> 08:57.800
games are very very similar not totally but very similar and same with feeding

08:57.800 --> 09:00.360
friends well no I guess you don't have a gun and feeding friends but just I don't

09:00.360 --> 09:05.920
know that whole dodging how about me feels a little similar was it a mutant

09:05.920 --> 09:11.760
storm I haven't even played that there's also robot Ron now wait a minute robot

09:11.760 --> 09:12.760
Robotron is a classic.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.000
I mean a classic classic.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
You can't...

09:15.000 --> 09:16.680
Yeah, but I'm saying that they're all...

09:16.680 --> 09:17.680
Well, yeah, Smash TV.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.680
I'm not saying that.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.160
Robotron is more like Smash TV, if anything else, but both were made by the same company,

09:21.160 --> 09:25.200
so you could almost say that Smash TV, in an effed up way, is like Robotron.

09:25.200 --> 09:30.480
Maybe I'm just crazy.

09:30.480 --> 09:35.600
We mentioned in part A that you can get brand new outfits for Cameo.

09:35.600 --> 09:41.480
You can dress them up as Orchid and Killer Instinct characters and all those other things,

09:41.480 --> 09:46.280
But also one thing that should be noted about Cameo, they just patched their co-op mode

09:46.280 --> 09:51.600
and now you can do the online co-op play with Cameo and I believe new achievements come

09:51.600 --> 09:53.920
with this as well, but here's the thing.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.100
Because Cameo has already hit their limit of a thousand achievement points, now there

09:57.100 --> 10:02.080
are zero point achievements that you can get in Cameo with this new patch is what I'm hearing.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.280
You get achievements but they're not worth anything.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.540
Who cares?

10:06.540 --> 10:07.540
That's dead to me.

10:07.540 --> 10:11.540
Well, some people really wanted to do co-op and cameo, so...

10:11.540 --> 10:15.540
You know, I'm telling you, what they should do then is still give you the co-op achievements.

10:15.540 --> 10:20.540
Who cares if you play over live? Just do the same co-op achievements that they have in the game.

10:20.540 --> 10:23.540
Just, you know, now you can play live or local.

10:23.540 --> 10:28.540
And Hitstun says the online co-op patch is free, right? Yes, that is true, it is free.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.540
Yes.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.540
So, enjoy the free things while you can. I'm sure as soon as you put in cameo...

10:32.540 --> 10:35.540
I haven't patched mine yet, but I'm sure as soon as you put in cameo, it'll say,

10:35.540 --> 10:39.380
say an upgrade for this game is now available yay and then it'll just patch

10:39.380 --> 10:43.180
patch its way onto your hard drive that is assuming you have a hard drive then

10:43.180 --> 10:49.180
we can be underwhelmed with people on the internet at the same time you know

10:49.180 --> 10:51.460
what just made that made me think of though what happens if you don't have a

10:51.460 --> 10:56.420
hard drive are you just screwed are you gonna have to patch this game every time

10:56.420 --> 11:00.940
well you can maybe download the patch to your memory card oh I guess that's a

11:00.940 --> 11:03.500
good point I guess you could save it to your memory cards how are you gonna you

11:03.500 --> 11:07.820
play anything with a memory card. I know. Memory card was just useless. It's just something

11:07.820 --> 11:11.380
that they put out there and say, you know what, hey, there's an option to buying the,

11:11.380 --> 11:15.860
you know. No, you can take your memory card to an Xbox 360 kiosk and get Uber special

11:15.860 --> 11:22.580
downloads. That don't work! By the way, where the fuck is my goddamn burnout card that they

11:22.580 --> 11:26.780
promised me months ago that I download it from the kiosk and then we go to play burnout.

11:26.780 --> 11:33.460
Oh, by the way, it doesn't work! Oh, did we say working car? I don't believe we did. So,

11:33.460 --> 11:36.460
You know what? You're fucked!

11:36.460 --> 11:39.460
I love setting him off.

11:39.460 --> 11:42.460
Stupid kiosk thing.

11:42.460 --> 11:46.460
Why'd I spend the money on that stupid card? I don't know.

11:46.460 --> 11:49.460
Loki, what's next on the news?

11:49.460 --> 11:55.460
Seriously? Well, the Michigan game law was ruled unconstitutional.

11:55.460 --> 11:58.460
Like, we didn't see that coming.

11:58.460 --> 12:02.460
So yeah, basically thrown out because, yeah, it's unconstitutional blah blah blah.

12:02.460 --> 12:05.700
was the Michigan law like the California law or what was the deal there

12:05.700 --> 12:09.140
uh... Beyonce I don't know if it was very similar or not I imagine they're

12:09.140 --> 12:10.300
probably pretty close

12:10.300 --> 12:12.940
uh...

12:12.940 --> 12:14.740
I don't know it's

12:14.740 --> 12:18.980
they really shouldn't try to regulate the game sales and stuff

12:18.980 --> 12:23.180
it was summed up intended to restrict the sale of certain games to minors and they

12:23.180 --> 12:26.580
say that was unconstitutional and can't be implemented so it sounds pretty similar to what we

12:26.580 --> 12:29.900
had going on in California here exactly in fact I think that they should be able to

12:29.900 --> 12:33.900
to sell porn to minors too now because it's unconstitutional.

12:33.900 --> 12:37.140
Stop. Children have the right to porn.

12:37.140 --> 12:42.180
Have you no dignity?

12:42.180 --> 12:45.540
Have you no dignity? I don't.

12:45.540 --> 12:49.620
There's this new, we were talking about Xbox Live just a minute ago, there's a new

12:49.620 --> 12:52.660
application created by NimbleSoft

12:52.660 --> 12:56.780
and they created this small application saying that since they're such fanboys

12:56.780 --> 12:59.080
of the Xbox 360 they wrote this application.

12:59.080 --> 13:02.320
360 Friends is an Xbox Live friendless

13:02.320 --> 13:05.720
notifier. It'll tell you who's online, who's offline,

13:05.720 --> 13:08.840
let you view gamer cards, and notify when a friend's

13:08.840 --> 13:12.280
status changes. You can even have it in a little taskbar and it'll actually

13:12.280 --> 13:14.520
alert you when people sign on and offline.

13:14.520 --> 13:19.000
I guess what it's doing is it's kind of borrowing from exactly what Xbox

13:19.000 --> 13:23.440
Live, or I'm sorry, Xbox.com does, but it sort of delivers that news

13:23.440 --> 13:27.160
to your desktop. So you can see when, you know, if you're stalking someone, you can

13:27.160 --> 13:28.440
see right when they come online.

13:28.440 --> 13:32.360
so it's pretty cool so like I'd be able to see if Loki's online from my computer

13:32.360 --> 13:36.280
excellent if I if I'm too lazy to access xbox.com

13:36.280 --> 13:39.720
yes I'm surprised Microsoft didn't I think the most surprising thing about this

13:39.720 --> 13:41.520
story is that someone beat Microsoft to it

13:41.520 --> 13:45.700
I think if I were Microsoft right now I'd be kinda I'd be one to buy

13:45.700 --> 13:48.120
the software from this guy or acquire this guy

13:48.120 --> 13:52.760
no they would just want to sue him. Why? Because they're Microsoft and they can't.

13:52.760 --> 13:56.680
Why would you sue this guy? He wrote a practical useful application that

13:56.680 --> 14:00.640
adds value to the 360. All the more reason to sue him!

14:00.640 --> 14:04.520
Maybe they should put out an ad in PC Gamer about how wrong this is and that

14:04.520 --> 14:06.920
people should buy the software from Microsoft.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.280
Microsoft doesn't have the software, that's the point. It's probably gonna be in

14:10.280 --> 14:12.120
Vista whenever the hell that comes out.

14:12.120 --> 14:16.120
GK128 in the chat room says, I have 360 friends,

14:16.120 --> 14:20.200
the program. It's cool but it hogs RAM.

14:20.200 --> 14:24.180
So it might be a little bit of a memory hog. So have a lot of RAM if you're gonna be

14:24.180 --> 14:25.000
using this program.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.520
but you know also it's it's a program that has

14:29.520 --> 14:32.560
you know it's it's written by you know

14:32.560 --> 14:35.680
a fan essentially so it's probably not optimized yet

14:35.680 --> 14:38.840
it means the first release it sounds like so if this guy continues decides to

14:38.840 --> 14:39.440
continue to

14:39.440 --> 14:42.560
upgrade this it might get a little better in that regard yeah

14:42.560 --> 14:46.720
gk 128 would like to point out uses 63 megabytes of RAM currently

14:46.720 --> 14:51.240
mmm very interesting

14:51.240 --> 14:54.640
interesting alright moving on

14:54.640 --> 14:57.640
Loki, you have some music game news.

14:57.640 --> 15:01.640
Yes, In The Groove, PlayStation 2.

15:01.640 --> 15:06.320
As I've been stating before, this game is merely Stepmania.

15:06.320 --> 15:12.640
And now, like Stepmania, you can put your own songs in it for the PlayStation 2.

15:12.640 --> 15:17.520
However, of course, the tools have been out there already to unpack everything that's

15:17.520 --> 15:21.800
in The Groove for the PlayStation 2 and actually dump that stuff to your hard drive so you

15:21.800 --> 15:25.240
can play the official songs because they're just step mania files. Well now they have

15:25.240 --> 15:29.960
the tools to repack it so you can actually put whatever songs you want in there and be

15:29.960 --> 15:34.480
able to burn it to a disc and either play it with any sort of tools that you use to

15:34.480 --> 15:40.880
play backup discs on a Playstation 2 or hacks or workarounds or whatever. So I guess that's

15:40.880 --> 15:47.540
pretty cool. One of the reasons why, I don't understand why people pay for step mania,

15:47.540 --> 15:54.540
But now you can, and I'm just not surprised. I knew this was going to come one of these

15:55.240 --> 16:00.340
days and now that it's available, that's kind of neat. You get to play all your songs, if

16:00.340 --> 16:03.140
you like In the Groove songs, go ahead and play the In the Groove songs, if you like DDR.

16:03.140 --> 16:05.340
Yeah, because you put DDR songs in the Groove?

16:05.340 --> 16:10.260
They had it! DDR, all the DDR songs in the Groove 2, and In the Groove songs, all in one

16:10.260 --> 16:12.780
disc. So they had all this stuff in there.

16:12.780 --> 16:15.180
Can you just download this from the website, burn it, and ready to go?

16:15.180 --> 16:20.100
I don't know, it's not available on the website, you gotta dig for it and unfortunately I cannot

16:20.100 --> 16:27.460
give out where it is, but you know, if your local Balmani downloading ISO place will probably

16:27.460 --> 16:37.100
have it, you know, BitTorrent, that type of thing, so look for it and have fun I guess.

16:37.100 --> 16:38.800
Very interesting.

16:38.800 --> 16:44.060
Moving on, a follow up to a story we were talking about a few weeks ago, remember the

16:44.060 --> 16:49.060
a town in Ohio that got slammed on April Fools.

16:49.420 --> 16:51.340
Actually, we may not have done this on the last podcast.

16:51.340 --> 16:55.260
This may have been my spinoff show I did on Wednesday.

16:55.260 --> 16:56.520
I talked about this story about the girls

16:56.520 --> 16:57.760
who played the prank in the town

16:57.760 --> 16:59.440
and had little question mark blocks.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.280
They hung around the town.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.140
The bomb squad had to be called in

17:02.140 --> 17:03.940
because they thought that they might actually be bombed.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.020
Did they think they were getting attacked by the Riddler?

17:06.020 --> 17:08.180
Possibly because of the big question marks on them.

17:08.180 --> 17:09.260
I don't know.

17:09.260 --> 17:11.300
But apparently this was like a thing

17:11.300 --> 17:12.680
that they were doing across the nation

17:12.680 --> 17:16.120
was these little question mark blocks, it was a little game, well you know those girls

17:16.120 --> 17:19.480
were in big freaking trouble when they did this.

17:19.480 --> 17:25.480
They were not going to have charges pressed against them, basically according to the county

17:25.480 --> 17:30.560
prosecutor these girls, quote, were not thinking about the consequences of their actions in

17:30.560 --> 17:36.200
this day and age, so if you plan on painting the town Mario, think twice because you might

17:36.200 --> 17:37.200
be labeled a terrorist.

17:37.200 --> 17:41.000
Well that and the fact that they didn't really break any laws, so what are you going to do?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I'm arresting you for scaring me!

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
Wait, hold on though, you know, in this day and age, can you really leave a suspicious box?

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Most people don't know what a question mark block reference is, and you're right,

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
they probably think about Batman or something, you know?

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Yeah, I'm gonna blow up this street light.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Al-Qaeda will strike us in our street lights!

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Oh my, now the FBI's gonna monitor this program, thank you very much.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
You jerk.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.160
I kind of agree though, it's an iconic symbol, I can't help but think

18:11.160 --> 18:14.600
three out of three people in this room are going to know

18:14.600 --> 18:18.520
what that question mark is. Back to the OLR statistics magic, right?

18:18.520 --> 18:21.840
So a hundred percent of Americans know what a question mark block is and shouldn't have

18:21.840 --> 18:22.400
been alarmed,

18:22.400 --> 18:27.400
right? This is what I'm saying. Alright. But really the percentage must be over

18:27.400 --> 18:28.320
fifty percent.

18:28.320 --> 18:32.120
I can't help but believe that this... Not if you're an old person!

18:32.120 --> 18:36.640
So your grandmother wouldn't know what a question mark block is?

18:36.640 --> 18:40.080
Probably, unless my grandma happened to be old granny hardcore, probably not.

18:40.080 --> 18:43.860
No, my grandma would have no idea what a question mark block is.

18:43.860 --> 18:47.600
She would have no idea. She would probably think about

18:47.600 --> 18:50.840
Frank Gorshin from Batman, the Riddler.

18:50.840 --> 18:56.560
That was my Riddler impersonation. That was great, huh?

18:56.560 --> 18:59.580
I worked on that all day. I stand corrected. Alright,

18:59.580 --> 19:03.340
Maybe we won't be in so much trouble if we find a cure for cancer, right Loki?

19:03.340 --> 19:07.260
Yes, in the meantime though you can play a game called Remission

19:07.260 --> 19:13.020
where you can blow a cancer. Yes, in this game basically you play a

19:13.020 --> 19:16.540
micro robot by the name of

19:16.540 --> 19:20.300
I believe Roxy and

19:20.300 --> 19:23.740
you are basically in the body

19:23.740 --> 19:27.500
and destroying these rapidly multiplying rogue cells.

19:27.500 --> 19:34.180
And, basically, it's something that I've kind of done to help cancer patients cope with

19:34.180 --> 19:44.180
their illness while educating them and increasing players' sense of control over their circumstances.

19:44.180 --> 19:45.180
That's great.

19:45.180 --> 19:48.940
Unfortunately, though, it should be mentioned that this game does not cure cancer.

19:48.940 --> 19:53.900
Just clear up anything because, you know, there's a lot of stupid people out there.

19:53.900 --> 19:59.340
You know what it kind of sounds like to me?

19:59.340 --> 20:04.460
It's like that old game that would be like the tooth fighter, the cavity fighting game.

20:04.460 --> 20:08.900
I remember I had this on Commodore 64 and you carried around the giant toothbrush and

20:08.900 --> 20:12.540
you had to wipe the plaque or you'd get attacked by the little cavity monsters.

20:12.540 --> 20:17.140
That's what this sounds like to me, except instead of teeth, it's cancer.

20:17.140 --> 20:21.420
Cancer patients will get to play crappy games now, as if they weren't tortured enough about

20:21.420 --> 20:24.940
you know the fact that you know their cancer might not be you know operable

20:24.940 --> 20:27.620
grave

20:27.620 --> 20:31.540
it's like yeah you know that cure cancer

20:31.540 --> 20:35.460
we couldn't really find that but here play a game

20:35.460 --> 20:40.500
you can address those cards and letters to loki at orange lounge radio dot com

20:40.500 --> 20:41.820
send flowers he loves them

20:41.820 --> 20:46.180
all right I dark soccer is not here tonight as we mentioned earlier in the

20:46.180 --> 20:49.420
program she's feeling sick she has asian bird flu

20:49.420 --> 20:53.420
No, I'm teasing. She doesn't have Asian bird flu, but she's sick, and we hope she feels better soon.

20:53.420 --> 20:58.420
She's usually in charge of the mailbox, and this would be the part where we would go to the mailbag.

20:58.420 --> 21:06.420
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com. However, I haven't dug through the mailbag this week, so I have no idea what's in there.

21:06.420 --> 21:10.420
However, I have looked at the MySpace, and we got some questions on MySpace.

21:10.420 --> 21:14.420
People who didn't realize they can send it over to Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

21:14.420 --> 21:17.420
So I'm going to go ahead and read a question that we got on MySpace.

21:17.420 --> 21:20.260
And this question comes to us from Joey. Hi, Joey

21:21.020 --> 21:21.980
Joey says hey

21:21.980 --> 21:23.980
I just got through part B of this week's podcast

21:24.060 --> 21:30.460
Meaning last week 179 the part where you guys talked about the Genesis got me to my closet and I pulled out my Genesis 3

21:30.460 --> 21:37.100
The slim line of the Genesis if you will then I realized the only game I could find was my Street Fighter 2 special

21:37.140 --> 21:38.820
champions edition and Mortal Kombat

21:38.820 --> 21:44.500
I was hoping to restart my collection and hoping you could help me out by giving me a short list of good games to look

21:44.500 --> 21:49.660
for. Now I know all about the Sonics and Toejam and Earls, so maybe if you guys knew some

21:49.660 --> 21:54.000
non-mainstream games, that would be awesome. Also, do you remember the name of that new

21:54.000 --> 21:57.960
Genesis game being released? I'm not sure if I heard about it from you guys, but this

21:57.960 --> 22:01.980
is the only show I can think of that would have cool news like that. Sorry about the

22:01.980 --> 22:07.640
length of this, by the way. Not a problem, Joey. Appreciate the MySpace message. Joey,

22:07.640 --> 22:10.840
the name of the game you're trying to think about on the Genesis is called Beggar Prince.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.600
That was the new game that's being released.

22:12.600 --> 22:18.360
We did bring that up a few weeks ago on this show, and actually, if you want to visit one

22:18.360 --> 22:24.520
of our buddies over on allgames.com, Bobby Blackwolf, visit his site at allgames.com

22:24.520 --> 22:31.080
slash podcast, and actually I think he's also at bobbyblackwolfshow.com now.

22:31.080 --> 22:34.700
He had an interview with the people that made Baker Prince, it was a really long interview,

22:34.700 --> 22:38.720
so if you want to hear all about Genesis development in this day and age, look back in his archives

22:38.720 --> 22:43.280
about six weeks or so, and he had an interview a while back, so check that out.

22:43.280 --> 22:47.820
As far as non-standard Genesis games, well you didn't mention Phantasy Star, my friend,

22:47.820 --> 22:52.280
so if you're into RPGs, you don't want to miss the Phantasy Star series.

22:52.280 --> 22:54.800
It's a shame Jamie's not here, because she loves the obscure Genesis titles.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.280
Can you think of anything, Spike?

22:57.280 --> 23:00.740
Could we start with obscure and work our way down, because we could go for a good hour

23:00.740 --> 23:01.740
here.

23:01.740 --> 23:02.740
Okay, try me.

23:02.740 --> 23:05.080
Name some titles that this kid needs on his Genesis.

23:05.080 --> 23:12.340
I would strongly recommend, let's see, Decap Attack, and the funny thing is, if you've

23:12.340 --> 23:14.900
never played it, I mean, it's a fairly cartoony game.

23:14.900 --> 23:19.940
I mean, yeah, you're a mummy zombie guy throwing your head at people, but it's done in a comical

23:19.940 --> 23:23.740
style of, like, Rise Star, which I would also recommend.

23:23.740 --> 23:25.780
Rise Star, Gunstar Heroes...

23:25.780 --> 23:30.460
What was that one that was, uh, it was, like, in a comic book?

23:30.460 --> 23:31.460
The whole book?

23:31.460 --> 23:32.460
Comic Zone?

23:32.460 --> 23:33.460
Comic Zone.

23:33.460 --> 23:35.860
Excellent addition to that list, by the way.

23:35.860 --> 23:39.020
Oh yeah, I highly recommend it.

23:39.020 --> 23:42.780
I mean, if we're going even with, you know, kind of the standard games, don't let yourself

23:42.780 --> 23:45.540
forget the Echo games.

23:45.540 --> 23:50.180
Don't let yourself forget Eternal Champions if you like substandard 2D graphics in a kind

23:50.180 --> 23:55.840
of subpar fighting game that's so cheesy you can't help but laugh.

23:55.840 --> 23:59.300
Comments from our chat room here, some suggestions from the chat room.

23:59.300 --> 24:04.740
Legend of Zaku suggests After Burner 2, Rama suggests Kid Chameleon, DJ Pooh Eater suggests

24:04.740 --> 24:12.580
Alex Kidd, Legend of Zaku also suggests Vectorman as well, lots of interesting suggestions there,

24:12.580 --> 24:15.900
oh you didn't like the Vectorman suggestion did you?

24:15.900 --> 24:19.960
They didn't say Vectorman 2 so they get a point there.

24:19.960 --> 24:26.300
Anything else real quickly you want to recommend?

24:26.300 --> 24:27.300
Wonderboy and Monsterworld.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.800
There you go.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.800
Wonderboy and Monsterworld.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.800
My best Genesis.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.340
And Jamie would say Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.

24:33.340 --> 24:34.340
I don't know.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.340
Can you even get that in this country?

24:35.340 --> 24:36.340
I don't even know.

24:36.340 --> 24:37.340
All right.

24:37.340 --> 24:38.340
There's some suggestions for you.

24:38.340 --> 24:40.540
Also a couple of quick, quick emails.

24:40.540 --> 24:44.180
My sister sent me an email because I think she's listening to the program or something,

24:44.180 --> 24:48.180
but my sister sent me an email, Dana, and she says, Can you tell me what's wrong when

24:48.180 --> 24:49.180
I try to DDR?

24:49.180 --> 24:50.180
My foot won't work.

24:50.180 --> 24:54.420
I try to dance, but when I go fast, my foot quits working.

24:54.420 --> 24:56.920
But I really like your Japanese pop.

24:56.920 --> 25:01.880
My sister writes her emails like a seven-year-old, might I share.

25:01.880 --> 25:06.420
If you're playing too much DDR and your foot stops working, stop playing DDR for a couple

25:06.420 --> 25:07.740
days and then go back.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.780
You should never push yourself too much on DDR.

25:09.780 --> 25:14.500
If you're feeling stamina, soreness issues, any of that stuff, seriously take a break.

25:14.500 --> 25:20.520
One other quick email, this came to us from Justin M. This came to my email box, not the

25:20.520 --> 25:21.520
normal mailbag.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.960
know if you've heard yet but they're making a movie of DOA. It looks awesome. It comes

25:25.960 --> 25:31.640
out this August. Awesome or awful? Sorry, gotta disagree with you there. Yes, we know

25:31.640 --> 25:36.080
the Dead or Alive movie is coming, but as to the fact that it looks awesome, I suppose

25:36.080 --> 25:42.440
if you're into tits and ass it'll be great. Or Charlie's Angels. Yeah, the first Charlie's

25:42.440 --> 25:47.040
Angels was good. The second Charlie's Angels was... was. It just was. Second Charlie's

25:47.040 --> 25:51.120
Angels. It just was. If you believe that, I'd like to sell you this Alone in the Dark

25:51.120 --> 25:53.820
DVD I have stop be nice

25:55.120 --> 26:00.120
Be nice to the people who email me all right if you have an email you want to send us send it over to mailbag

26:00.120 --> 26:05.160
At orange lounge radio.com dark soccer will be back next week to read those emails and yes

26:05.160 --> 26:07.780
We will be doing a show next week on Easter Sunday

26:08.200 --> 26:11.760
Because we have nothing better to do because our families don't love us and didn't invite us over

26:12.200 --> 26:13.940
No, I'm teasing we minded

26:13.940 --> 26:18.360
I know I minded to but I don't know about your house, but Easter dinner at my house is like two o'clock

26:18.360 --> 26:22.660
So it leaves me leaves me plenty of time to do this program. We'll see. All right

26:23.320 --> 26:24.760
Loki

26:24.760 --> 26:26.120
Yes

26:26.120 --> 26:31.140
Canceled games. What's up? Yes, unfortunately if you're you know

26:32.480 --> 26:34.480
really looking forward to

26:34.560 --> 26:39.560
Spending the night on the internet with people and having virtual sex

26:41.080 --> 26:46.980
Think again spend the night the MMO that was going to be put out and basically the sex MMO

26:46.980 --> 26:50.420
So, um, cancelled.

26:50.420 --> 26:55.620
Difficulty raising funds, I guess is the reason for that.

26:55.620 --> 27:01.100
And so it's on hold indefinitely until they can make the money to, you know, pay the virtual

27:01.100 --> 27:02.420
prostitutes that are going to be in the game.

27:02.420 --> 27:03.420
I don't know.

27:03.420 --> 27:05.980
Imagine that the sex game couldn't get funding.

27:05.980 --> 27:07.980
And there was much rejoicing.

27:07.980 --> 27:09.340
Oh, no, no.

27:09.340 --> 27:10.460
I disagree.

27:10.460 --> 27:11.700
Because you know what?

27:11.700 --> 27:18.980
Why is it that we have a bazillion violent games, yet when we look at sex-related games,

27:18.980 --> 27:21.500
we have the guy game?

27:21.500 --> 27:22.500
Playboy Mansion.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.500
You know?

27:23.500 --> 27:26.300
What a bunch of crap.

27:26.300 --> 27:33.340
You know, I would like to see a sexual game that's not super crappy.

27:33.340 --> 27:35.820
And you think this was that game?

27:35.820 --> 27:41.580
Okay, maybe not, but, you know, I just, I don't, I don't know.

27:41.580 --> 27:45.660
I don't think we should be frowning on it just because it's a sex game.

27:45.660 --> 27:48.580
I mean, there's plenty of violent games out there that are okay.

27:48.580 --> 27:54.200
Yeah, but you have to understand, murder okay, sex not okay.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.720
Sex gets companies sued.

27:55.720 --> 28:01.620
How do you make the people to murder sex, right?

28:01.620 --> 28:03.300
Where's the logic here?

28:03.300 --> 28:05.500
Shouldn't it be murder bad sex good?

28:05.500 --> 28:10.940
All this hot coffee, sex game, what was Grand Theft Auto, murder game.

28:10.940 --> 28:14.540
game okay sex game not okay

28:14.540 --> 28:17.500
I agree with your point but I'm way more comfortable

28:17.500 --> 28:20.820
leveling with the party of MMO players than I am

28:20.820 --> 28:24.300
cybering with them with these 3D avatars

28:24.300 --> 28:28.220
Dude, people do it anyway

28:28.220 --> 28:35.220
your guild obviously in World of Warcraft is not as cool as mine okay

28:35.220 --> 28:38.900
my guild is called World of Wank and they're a great time, no I'm kidding I'm totally

28:38.900 --> 28:40.700
joking I hope you people don't think I'm serious

28:40.700 --> 28:44.380
but don't you think people do this in MMOs as it is?

28:44.380 --> 28:50.420
Come on. The Roleplay servers? What do you think that is? What do you think that's a

28:50.420 --> 28:51.260
front for?

28:51.260 --> 28:55.540
Roleplay? Hello. That's what Sims Online was.

28:55.540 --> 28:59.540
That's exactly what Sims Online turned into, was one giant Vegas.

28:59.540 --> 29:06.540
If you are a fan of music games...

29:06.540 --> 29:21.700
Music Games, you may have already heard this, but Red Octane CEO Kelly Sumner revealed last

29:21.700 --> 29:26.860
week that there are other products in development.

29:26.860 --> 29:30.500
This guy used to be with Take-Two Interactive Europe, but now he's with Red Octane.

29:30.500 --> 29:35.220
We can't tell you what the games are and when they're coming, but we kind of believe

29:35.220 --> 29:38.180
It's probably not just the Guitar Hero sequels.

29:38.180 --> 29:42.060
Perhaps this is a rival to Konami's Bomani brand?

29:42.060 --> 29:43.060
Who knows?

29:43.060 --> 29:44.860
Could be interesting.

29:44.860 --> 29:50.140
I think it's interesting because I think Beatmania would have been a good game for them to compete

29:50.140 --> 29:51.140
with.

29:51.140 --> 29:52.140
Do you think they'd still do it?

29:52.140 --> 29:53.820
You say rival, I say cheap knockoff.

29:53.820 --> 29:54.820
So...

29:54.820 --> 29:55.820
But...

29:55.820 --> 29:56.820
Okay, wait a minute though.

29:56.820 --> 29:57.820
Was Guitar Hero...

29:57.820 --> 30:00.700
Okay, maybe when you look at In the Groove DDR, I see your point there, despite the

30:00.700 --> 30:04.260
fact that it's still controversial, but Guitar Hero versus Guitar Freaks, I don't think that

30:04.260 --> 30:10.820
was a cheap knockoff. I don't. I think Guitar Hero was original enough and did a lot of...

30:10.820 --> 30:13.980
Obviously most of the critics out there, 99% of them feel the same way I do.

30:13.980 --> 30:20.580
Yeah, because 99% of the critics out there, they don't know the history of the music game

30:20.580 --> 30:23.460
series out there, and they also don't do the research. So...

30:23.460 --> 30:28.700
Just do them all! Just do them all!

30:28.700 --> 30:31.460
You don't think Guitar Hero innovated on the Guitar Freaks concept at all?

30:31.460 --> 30:37.820
Innovative by basically adding more buttons made it a little bit more difficult and by

30:37.820 --> 30:42.920
adding a whammy bar which didn't really do much you know what I stopped playing that

30:42.920 --> 30:47.800
game after a few times and I just got bored with it it's a cool it's a cool game because

30:47.800 --> 30:55.000
it's new to us the US and stuff but to be honest when these next few games come out

30:55.000 --> 30:58.820
or the next sequel or whatever it's just gonna be like a whole guitar freaks thing you mean

30:58.820 --> 31:02.040
Granted, I'm not saying Guitar Freaks is innovative because it's been the same damn game since

31:02.040 --> 31:03.040
Fifth Mix.

31:03.040 --> 31:08.500
They've been cookie-cuttering the whole thing along the way, but still, Spike, you have

31:08.500 --> 31:10.700
Adam first and I'll go.

31:10.700 --> 31:14.580
Now I definitely prefer Guitar Freaks to Guitar Hero.

31:14.580 --> 31:20.180
I do not like Guitar Hero, but as a musician, I will say that playing Guitar Hero is way

31:20.180 --> 31:23.940
closer to playing an actual instrument.

31:23.940 --> 31:27.280
And I think that in that way, it's actually a superior game.

31:27.280 --> 31:31.280
Even if I don't prefer it myself, I think that on a technical level, it's a much more

31:31.280 --> 31:32.280
impressive work.

31:32.280 --> 31:35.240
Okay, here's my deal, and I'm taking the music out of this equation.

31:35.240 --> 31:38.520
I'm not even considering the music in Guitar Freaks and music in Guitar Hero, because that's

31:38.520 --> 31:39.640
a matter of opinion.

31:39.640 --> 31:42.880
Okay, so just putting the game engine side by side.

31:42.880 --> 31:46.240
Guitar Hero has way more of the fun factor in it.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.800
Guitar Freaks, turn it on, pick your song, go.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.040
Turn it on, pick your song, go.

31:50.040 --> 31:53.480
Guitar Hero has that whole, like, oh, you're in a band and you have the shops where you

31:53.480 --> 31:56.820
can upgrade your guitars and unlock the songs and you do the whammy and there's

31:56.820 --> 31:58.700
a crowd there and they're yelling for you

31:58.700 --> 32:01.900
whereas guitar freaks is here look at this choppy animation while you play

32:01.900 --> 32:03.060
your song

32:03.060 --> 32:06.220
there's a lot to be said there that makes it more of a party game okay so

32:06.220 --> 32:09.340
you upgrade your guitar which does what

32:09.340 --> 32:12.660
oh it changes the appearance of your guitar in the game whoop-a-dee-doo

32:12.660 --> 32:17.540
that's but there's a crowd what does guitar freaks have nothing

32:17.540 --> 32:19.420
it doesn't have any of that

32:19.420 --> 32:22.000
it has the fact that it was first

32:22.000 --> 32:25.300
have that

32:25.300 --> 32:29.540
don't call it an original game call it an improvement of another game. How about that?

32:29.540 --> 32:33.780
I will give you that because it does when I play Guitar Hero it really does

32:33.780 --> 32:35.780
feel to me like I am playing

32:35.780 --> 32:40.760
Guitar Freaks mixed with Amplitude. Exactly. But with, I don't know, with

32:40.760 --> 32:45.240
more of the fun factor for me. I just hate being able to call it this way. There's a reason why it's so

32:45.240 --> 32:46.700
accessible to people.

32:46.700 --> 32:50.260
I don't mind it being a good game. I hate the fact that people are calling it

32:50.260 --> 32:54.860
innovative because it's not you know granted it may be more realistic to you

32:54.860 --> 32:57.580
know playing a guitar doesn't make it innovative makes it better

32:57.580 --> 33:01.020
okay and also the fact that people are you know

33:01.020 --> 33:04.340
kind of basically posing this as an original game it's not original game it

33:04.340 --> 33:06.140
fucking rips off three different games

33:06.140 --> 33:09.820
what's the best things of them together granted that's a good idea it's you

33:09.820 --> 33:13.780
basically improving on those concepts but it's not an original game

33:13.780 --> 33:15.500
you know I'm just

33:15.500 --> 33:18.360
I hate people calling original and innovative

33:18.360 --> 33:21.360
Katamari Damacy, that was original.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.800
This is not original.

33:23.800 --> 33:26.200
All right, comments from our chat room.

33:26.200 --> 33:29.080
GS191 says, the only reason people like Guitar Hero is

33:29.080 --> 33:29.880
because of the music.

33:29.880 --> 33:32.080
The majority of America does not like the whole techno

33:32.080 --> 33:34.120
J-pop theme.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.880
Interesting point there.

33:35.880 --> 33:39.200
We also have, let's say, Fireboma says, if you showed

33:39.200 --> 33:41.480
critics Guitar Freaks, they'd say it was a rip-off of

33:41.480 --> 33:43.280
Guitar Hero at this point in time.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.880
And I'd agree with you, but that's just a lot of critics.

33:45.880 --> 33:46.800
They're ignorant.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.000
They're ignorant.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.720
Because you watch, if they decide to release, you know, guitar freaks over here, they'll

33:52.720 --> 33:56.080
be like, why are they ripping off Guitar Hero?

33:56.080 --> 33:57.080
What the hell?

33:57.080 --> 33:58.720
This is a crappy Guitar Hero knock-off.

33:58.720 --> 34:04.080
Seriously, I'm going to fucking beat those people to death is what's going to happen.

34:04.080 --> 34:10.680
I don't know if Spike's laughing at the same thing I am, but Dark Tetsuya wrote in the

34:10.680 --> 34:14.480
chat room, ignorant, but he capitalized the first three letters of that word, and I'll

34:14.480 --> 34:20.280
And I'll just let you kind of dream up what he's trying to say there.

34:20.280 --> 34:21.760
I'll leave it to you.

34:21.760 --> 34:25.440
And then of course our chat room is just going off with what the mystery game could be.

34:25.440 --> 34:32.080
DJ Pooh Eater suggests Banjo Freaks, Firebooma suggests Clarinet Hero, DJ Pooh Eater, Flute

34:32.080 --> 34:37.380
Hero, Hitstun, Xylophone Hero, Drum Hero says Dark Knight, which I think a lot of us are

34:37.380 --> 34:39.080
thinking might be it.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.080
You know, why not?

34:40.080 --> 34:44.600
If they're going to rip off Guitar Freaks, why don't they rip off Drummania while they're

34:44.600 --> 34:45.600
at it?

34:45.600 --> 34:51.260
I mean seriously, I would not be surprised if that's the big surprise game at E3 is Drum

34:51.260 --> 34:54.200
Hero or whatever they call it.

34:54.200 --> 34:57.480
Spiritsnarrow would like to point out, people in reviews have actually nodded to Guitar

34:57.480 --> 34:58.960
Freaks at least once.

34:58.960 --> 35:02.880
Depends what site you're reading it from, but you are right, I have seen those reviews

35:02.880 --> 35:06.200
that have been good enough to do that.

35:06.200 --> 35:12.480
on to a new topic. Loki, I thought this game was already out, but there's a new game coming

35:12.480 --> 35:17.280
to the Playstation 2 and PSP? Yeah, the Fast and the Furious. Like I said, I thought this

35:17.280 --> 35:19.960
game was already out. It was called Need for Speed Most Wanted Underground. It was also

35:19.960 --> 35:26.960
called Midnight Club 3 Dub Edition. That's right, yeah. Or Juice Precision Street Racing.

35:27.800 --> 35:33.200
No, but they're actually... Please, nobody played that. Hey, they're making a PSP port

35:33.200 --> 35:38.360
of it or whatever. Apparently somebody did. But no, actually they are making a licensed

35:38.360 --> 35:45.360
game based on the upcoming movie. Fast and Furious 3 Tokyo Drift. LAME! Wait, for real?

35:45.960 --> 35:50.460
There's a Fast and the Furious 3 Tokyo Drift coming out? Yes, seriously. Isn't that just

35:50.460 --> 35:55.600
initial D the movie? The funny thing is, it doesn't even have Paul Walker. It has a guy

35:55.600 --> 35:59.760
who looks like Paul Walker. I thought Paul Walker was in that. No, Paul Walker is in

35:59.760 --> 36:00.760
the movie.

36:00.760 --> 36:04.880
No, Paul Walker is in that movie because Paul Walker has no work other than that.

36:04.880 --> 36:06.640
Is it Paul Walker goes to Tokyo?

36:06.640 --> 36:07.640
Is that the plot?

36:07.640 --> 36:08.640
It's stupid.

36:08.640 --> 36:09.640
It's just being...

36:09.640 --> 36:10.640
Paul Walker versus the Asian mafia?

36:10.640 --> 36:13.680
It's basically, ooh, the Asian chick who's hot.

36:13.680 --> 36:17.200
Let's bring her back and let's bring Paul Walker back because we need somebody from

36:17.200 --> 36:18.200
the original series.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.200
Maybe they'll have sex.

36:19.200 --> 36:22.600
And yeah, maybe they'll have sex and she'll get all hot and schoolgirl-like and uh...

36:22.600 --> 36:25.760
Paul Walker is not listed on Internet Movie Database.

36:25.760 --> 36:27.200
Well, too bad.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.880
No one's gonna miss him, so...

36:29.880 --> 36:32.440
You know, does this movie have Vin Diesel in it?

36:32.440 --> 36:35.500
Okay, Rama in our chat room would like to point this out, and I'm almost positive he's

36:35.500 --> 36:36.500
right here.

36:36.500 --> 36:41.600
Fast and the Furious was already in the arcade, and it was based on the LA Rush engine.

36:41.600 --> 36:45.520
I'm sure it was, but anyways, this game is gonna be coming out.

36:45.520 --> 36:49.560
What's unique about it, well, I'm not sure if it's unique, but it's kinda cool, is they're

36:49.560 --> 36:55.900
gonna have 500 body kits from authentic manufacturers, so you're actually gonna have real upgrade

36:55.900 --> 37:02.600
part and you know it's also going to feature boss races as well as advanced rubber band

37:02.600 --> 37:04.100
artificial intelligence systems.

37:04.100 --> 37:09.220
I fucking hate god damn advanced rubber band artificial intelligence systems.

37:09.220 --> 37:13.840
You're racing, you're kicking the AI's ass and all of a sudden, they're going 500 fucking

37:13.840 --> 37:15.320
miles to catch up to you.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.320
I don't think so.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.800
If you're fucking out racing them.

37:17.800 --> 37:22.220
I love it in Initial D because I'm always behind in the race, like I'll be racing a

37:22.220 --> 37:25.760
friend I'm always behind and then it totally favors you on the last lap and then right

37:25.760 --> 37:30.580
at the finish line. I get ahead of them and they're like, MOTHERFUCKER! No seriously,

37:30.580 --> 37:34.720
like when I'm playing Burnout or something like that, I will have destroyed the car I'm

37:34.720 --> 37:39.020
racing as. You know, racing against one car. You know, destroyed him like, and I've already

37:39.020 --> 37:43.520
almost slapped the guy, and all of a sudden he's going like Mach 7 down this goddamn freeway.

37:43.520 --> 37:49.700
They catch up to me. So, I hate that shit. But anyways, so um, this game's coming out.

37:49.700 --> 37:56.680
2 PSP only yeah check it out if it looks good I don't know to be honest it's just

37:56.680 --> 38:01.040
gonna be another racing game and there are midnight club 3 double-dition remix

38:01.040 --> 38:07.100
just came out what a few weeks ago it's like 1999 by that instead I mean

38:07.100 --> 38:13.700
seriously don't encourage them to make more movies I didn't say by no no I

38:13.700 --> 38:16.380
that's what I'm saying I'm saying I'm saying to the youth of America do not

38:16.380 --> 38:18.860
encourage these people to make Fast and the Furious 4.

38:18.860 --> 38:21.700
Seriously, who the hell is in this?

38:21.700 --> 38:23.920
The Asian chick now is in this, okay?

38:23.920 --> 38:25.220
Was Vin Diesel in this?

38:25.220 --> 38:26.220
No.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.220
Was Paul Walker in this?

38:27.220 --> 38:28.220
No.

38:28.220 --> 38:29.220
That's sad.

38:29.220 --> 38:33.020
Ranma in our chat room is saying, hey, the Fast and the Furious 3 will own for one reason.

38:33.020 --> 38:36.140
Keiko Kirikawa, who is Sailor Mars.

38:36.140 --> 38:43.020
Yeah, the Asian chick, as I'm dubbing her.

38:43.020 --> 38:49.020
By the way, she's lending her likeness to other really fun movies like the Dead or Alive

38:49.020 --> 38:51.620
movie, which sucks balls, by the way.

38:51.620 --> 38:52.800
You haven't seen it.

38:52.800 --> 38:56.020
I've seen the trailer, and it sucks balls.

38:56.020 --> 38:57.980
You can't judge a movie based off the trailer.

38:57.980 --> 39:04.540
Dude, the trailer is fucking, you know, let's rip off Charlie's Angels 2.

39:04.540 --> 39:08.100
I'm trying to think of a movie that had a great trailer that sucked balls.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.820
Because if that's true, the reverse would be true.

39:09.820 --> 39:15.940
movie with a great trailer that sucked balls? I want to say Fantastic Four but I

39:15.940 --> 39:19.900
haven't seen it so I can't really dog on it but most people have told me it's bad.

39:19.900 --> 39:24.660
So transporter one and two. Okay there you go. Good call. Good call. So

39:24.660 --> 39:28.980
transporter one and two. How about Freddy vs. Jason maybe? Like you know you see the

39:28.980 --> 39:31.900
trailer and you go that's a fucking great concept. You go and see the movie

39:31.900 --> 39:35.460
and you're like what the fuck did I just waste $10 on? No I'm just teasing it

39:35.460 --> 39:39.760
wasn't that bad I can't really I can't really rag on it but yeah I mean

39:39.760 --> 39:44.840
you get my point. Well Freddy vs. Jason was supposed to be cheesy

39:44.840 --> 39:48.880
that's the whole point. And it'll be just like Freddy vs.

39:48.880 --> 39:52.280
Jason vs. Ash if they ever do that, which I wish they would.

39:52.280 --> 39:56.360
You know, completely off topic here, has anyone actually seen, you know, Triple X

39:56.360 --> 40:01.920
2 or whatever? No, why would I do that? It's great though, I haven't seen Triple X 1.

40:01.920 --> 40:05.240
They have this hilarious thing though, it's this bonus thing where they're talking about what

40:05.240 --> 40:06.280
happened to the original

40:06.280 --> 40:09.720
triple X character Vin Diesel's character in the way they've done it

40:09.720 --> 40:13.580
they've shot every shot you see a triple X is just the back of him so because

40:13.580 --> 40:19.480
it's not Vin Diesel but they like they kill him off like really bad that was

40:19.480 --> 40:22.840
that episode of South Park where they spliced all of Isaac Hayes lines

40:22.840 --> 40:29.880
together to get Shaq you know hello children would you like to make love

40:29.880 --> 40:34.880
and that whole thing yeah all right a new story please thank you

40:34.880 --> 40:39.440
Namco has new Namco Bandai I should say has new plug-and-play controllers

40:39.440 --> 40:45.200
they're going to be releasing it's called let's TV play classic yeah these

40:45.200 --> 40:48.920
controllers will plug directly into your TV and have four playable games two old

40:48.920 --> 40:55.560
ones two new ones Namco nostalgia has the retro dragon buster and new dragon

40:55.560 --> 41:01.440
Buster 100 retail price is just under $30 US so what I'm curious are they

41:01.440 --> 41:04.560
gonna have some of those other Namco things they've upgraded I see Mappy and

41:04.560 --> 41:09.320
it looks like Xevious on the one of these box arts there so it might be some

41:09.320 --> 41:12.520
kind of cool stuff by the way before you start thanking Namco for this kind of

41:12.520 --> 41:17.880
stuff all of you know Namco is putting out the fast and the furious game so

41:17.880 --> 41:26.840
reserve your hate well said Loki it's tax season right who missed the memo

41:26.840 --> 41:34.680
apparently Capcom in Japan yeah either they forgot to fail to or they failed to

41:34.680 --> 41:40.120
report approximately five point twelve billion yen that's about forty four

41:40.120 --> 41:47.520
million dollars and in US and over six over the course of six years the penalty

41:47.520 --> 41:54.480
is about 1.2 billion yen or 10 million dollars u.s. and so because of this

41:54.480 --> 41:58.740
actually they delayed dead rising was one of the games that's being delayed

41:58.740 --> 42:06.140
right now because of that and yeah it's kind of interesting oops slight

42:06.140 --> 42:11.400
oversight there oh we have the file taxes that seems like a reasonable

42:11.400 --> 42:18.960
mistake? Sure. We were just talking about Namco a minute ago and there's an

42:18.960 --> 42:22.440
announcement kind of circulating this week. Old-school Namco games are soon

42:22.440 --> 42:27.800
going to be available on Xbox Live Arcade because, you know, making that Namco

42:27.800 --> 42:31.240
collection that they released on Xbox, making it backwards compatible just

42:31.240 --> 42:32.320
wouldn't be good enough.

42:32.320 --> 42:35.480
Let's milk some more money out of this franchise and let's put these games on

42:35.480 --> 42:38.960
Xbox Live so people can hoard gamer points even more.

42:38.960 --> 42:42.320
Pac-Man and Galaga are on their way to Xbox Live Arcade

42:42.320 --> 42:46.860
complete with leaderboards and achievements. I can't possibly fathom

42:46.860 --> 42:47.960
what achievements

42:47.960 --> 42:50.760
will be available on Pac-Man.

42:50.760 --> 42:54.440
You ate a ghost! Ding! 20 points! And yet you're gonna buy them aren't you?

42:54.440 --> 42:58.160
Probably because I'm a sad, sad man. You know, hasn't Pac-Man been on like every

42:58.160 --> 42:59.080
system

42:59.080 --> 43:04.120
ever? Probably. Yeah. Probably. So this really isn't much of a surprise

43:04.120 --> 43:07.840
honestly. Well just the fact that it's coming to Xbox Live Arcade I guess is a surprise.

43:07.840 --> 43:11.080
but uh... notice how namco museum actually no i think i i think the

43:11.080 --> 43:14.840
namco museum actually i might be wrong i think it is backwards compatible

43:14.840 --> 43:17.880
i think that uh... fiftieth one i think i do remember seeing it on the backwards

43:17.880 --> 43:20.640
compatibility list i think you can play it doesn't matter anyways if you had a

43:20.640 --> 43:24.400
ridge racer you could play it anyways that's all i guess that's true

43:24.400 --> 43:25.400
very good point

43:25.400 --> 43:26.400
uh...

43:26.400 --> 43:30.220
so but they want you to pay five dollars or maybe even ten who knows for leader

43:30.220 --> 43:33.020
boards and what have you now here's an idea

43:33.020 --> 43:36.240
how about eight port of the pac-man verses

43:36.240 --> 43:39.900
like you had on the Game Boy Advance that you could hook into the GameCube

43:39.900 --> 43:44.180
where you could play it on Xbox Live and some of your friends are the ghosts

43:44.180 --> 43:48.180
and you're the Pac-Man. Now wouldn't that be a lot better? Wouldn't that make my money more worthwhile?

43:48.180 --> 43:51.960
So how about this? Instead of just porting over the original Pac-Man, how about you port over one of the

43:51.960 --> 43:55.580
Pac-Man remixes that they have, you know, where the graphics are at least a little bit better.

43:55.580 --> 43:58.700
Where, you know, it might utilize the widescreen,

43:58.700 --> 44:03.620
you know, like it did on the PSP. But no. No, we have to port over the original one and put some

44:03.620 --> 44:06.860
art on the side there because yeah

44:06.860 --> 44:12.500
it's great. Yeah. Rama in the chat room says fuck Pac-Man versus I want Pac-Mania

44:12.500 --> 44:16.580
I want them both why don't we just get like a small Pac-Man anthology there

44:16.580 --> 44:21.020
come on for five bucks for old games come on you can give me some

44:21.020 --> 44:25.860
other old Pac-Mania you can give me Pac-Mania you can give me Pac-Man 91 or whatever it was

44:25.860 --> 44:26.740
when they did the

44:26.740 --> 44:32.500
the souped up versions give me some of that.

44:32.500 --> 44:35.240
Loki oh, I wait at first I want to mention this

44:36.020 --> 44:43.060
Gamer points. I was reading the Xbox forums this week and I saw some person say that they had rented top spin, too

44:43.060 --> 44:49.240
And that they had figured out a way for them and their friend to play on Xbox Live and whore up the gamer points

44:49.240 --> 44:52.680
By it because if you quit out of a match you still get credit for playing the match

44:52.700 --> 44:56.740
So it was really easy to unlock the 25 and 50 matches gamer points

44:56.740 --> 45:01.080
Is it ethical to do this to cheat your way to getting these gamer points?

45:01.080 --> 45:09.080
How about renting games, getting the points, or basically renting games just for the sole purpose of milking out as many points as you can. Is that ethical?

45:09.080 --> 45:17.080
Well, renting games, I wouldn't say it's not ethical. I would say that you just, you know, probably could be doing better things with your time and money.

45:17.080 --> 45:27.080
But, you know, if you're playing the games to actually get the points correctly, then, you know, that's your prerogative if you want to go and rent these really crappy games to get the points out of them.

45:27.080 --> 45:33.080
Um, as far as cheating to get points, I don't think it's right, but I do it, and, um...

45:33.080 --> 45:41.080
Well, necessarily, I don't go as far as, you know, quitting games and stuff like that to cheat, but like, for example, Far Cry has cheat codes, and...

45:41.080 --> 45:46.080
Ubisoft, they let you get achievement points with the cheat codes, and they have the same thing with Ghost Recon.

45:46.080 --> 45:52.080
You know, it's their own damn fault that they didn't, you know, program it in there where you can't get the achievement with those.

45:52.080 --> 45:56.760
Um, the outfit has cheat codes, but you don't get achievement points if you have them on,

45:56.760 --> 46:02.240
so you know, the outfit sucks, by the way, but um, I don't know.

46:02.240 --> 46:09.240
I think it's their own fault for that, so yeah, I guess it's wrong that they're cheating,

46:09.240 --> 46:11.240
but I don't know.

46:11.240 --> 46:14.080
I don't see a problem with them renting games.

46:14.080 --> 46:15.200
I don't know.

46:15.200 --> 46:19.080
I think I agree with your point where it's, I don't think it's renting the games to get

46:19.080 --> 46:20.080
the points that's so bad.

46:20.080 --> 46:23.600
I mean, I've borrowed games from you, and I've worked my way to getting achievement

46:23.600 --> 46:26.860
points, but I would never cheat the system to do it.

46:26.860 --> 46:32.340
Like that whole quitting in and out thing, that was just stupid.

46:32.340 --> 46:37.420
If I notice that I'm going to get 10 points if I do this special little thing, it's like

46:37.420 --> 46:42.260
in Geometry Wars, who's going to sit there for 60 seconds dodging all the monsters?

46:42.260 --> 46:44.200
You wouldn't usually think to do that.

46:44.200 --> 46:47.380
But hey, it was worth 10 points, I'll give it a try.

46:47.380 --> 46:52.300
a little bit of a challenge, makes a little task. It's kind of like a mission. I sort

46:52.300 --> 46:55.340
of think of it that way. And I don't think there's anything unethical about doing that.

46:55.340 --> 46:59.380
Now, you can't really rent a game like Geometry Wars, but I think that theory applies. If

46:59.380 --> 47:02.340
you're going to rent games and accomplish as much as you can, I think that's okay. But

47:02.340 --> 47:07.800
I think when you resort to cheating and those things, I don't think that's okay. Specifically

47:07.800 --> 47:10.540
for the purpose of getting gamer points. I mean, if you're cheating your way through

47:10.540 --> 47:14.420
the game, then whatever, you've already made that decision. But I do think Xbox should

47:14.420 --> 47:17.260
figure out a way to disable gamer points when you're cheating.

47:17.260 --> 47:18.260
My point...

47:18.260 --> 47:20.380
But if the developers left it in there, that's their own damn fault.

47:20.380 --> 47:24.200
My point with Far Cry, for example, the game's hard enough even when you are cheating, so

47:24.200 --> 47:27.080
you know what, it's just added fun for my...

47:27.080 --> 47:32.220
They don't have an infinite health code, they just have infinite ammo, and infinite, like,

47:32.220 --> 47:37.940
feral or your adrenaline or whatever, and it's still really fun, it's still really hard,

47:37.940 --> 47:40.980
and it just makes it, you know, so I don't have to go and try to, you know, collect ammo

47:40.980 --> 47:43.980
and don't have to sneak my way through the game, because sneaking my way through the

47:43.980 --> 47:47.540
game we caused that game to be about five times as long as it is now and it

47:47.540 --> 47:51.420
is pretty long as it is so let's go to orange lounge radio.com click on chat and

47:51.420 --> 47:54.540
look in our chat room for some comments on here Fireboma wants to know what

47:54.540 --> 47:58.440
did the game what did the gamer points do nothing they're really they really

47:58.440 --> 48:02.760
aren't anything it's it's an internet penis thing the more points you have the

48:02.760 --> 48:06.180
bigger your internet penis is I mean even if you're a girl you know what I'm

48:06.180 --> 48:09.260
talking about you're I'm talking about that whole you know look at me I'm cool

48:09.260 --> 48:13.100
because I have you know 50 million gamer points you know and these are different

48:13.100 --> 48:18.060
from the points that you use to actually buy things on the Xbox.

48:18.060 --> 48:20.780
These are just totally useless status points.

48:20.780 --> 48:22.080
It's a status symbol.

48:22.080 --> 48:27.640
It's like, remember on the Atari 2600, if you could get like 2000 points and kaboom,

48:27.640 --> 48:31.380
you take a picture, remember don't use the flash and you send it to Activision, they'll

48:31.380 --> 48:33.920
send you a patch that you can put on your jacket.

48:33.920 --> 48:34.920
I think that's pretty cool.

48:34.920 --> 48:35.920
That's what this is.

48:35.920 --> 48:39.680
I think it's cool too, but I don't think it's cool and people cheat to do it.

48:39.680 --> 48:44.400
You know what, if they did that for the Xbox Live arcade games, the patches, I wonder if

48:44.400 --> 48:47.800
that would actually be kind of like a cult thing, you know, if people would pick up on

48:47.800 --> 48:48.800
that.

48:48.800 --> 48:52.680
Because, you know, people are into this retro shit, so I think that would be kind of neat.

48:52.680 --> 48:57.440
And you'd see probably a whole, I think it'd bring more attention to it, so, I don't know.

48:57.440 --> 49:00.880
DJ Poo Eater would like to know, is it virtual boobs for the girl gamers?

49:00.880 --> 49:07.440
No, Roz in the chat room says, my E penis, hers is 12 miles long on a cold day.

49:07.440 --> 49:10.960
That's quite the impressive e-penis there.

49:10.960 --> 49:12.680
Also what was the other comment in here I saw?

49:12.680 --> 49:18.760
Oh, GS191 said, great, point whoring, what's next, the achievement point police?

49:18.760 --> 49:21.940
Head on over to the Xbox Live forums, there are some people on there that have their panties

49:21.940 --> 49:25.680
in a bunch that people are cheating their way to getting these points.

49:25.680 --> 49:35.200
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line very, very soon over at our website www.orangelaunchradio.com.

49:35.200 --> 49:39.060
on interact with us and you can call us on the skype line to talk about anything that

49:39.060 --> 49:43.700
you want to hear this last few minutes of the show open forum but first a couple quick

49:43.700 --> 49:49.220
notes first off the other contest we promised we were going to do tonight we are also doing

49:49.220 --> 49:54.280
a giveaway tonight for amped three this is the action-packed snowboarding game for the

49:54.280 --> 49:58.700
xbox 360 now loki you actually own this game right i have to i have to be honest i haven't

49:58.700 --> 50:02.800
played this yet but loki you own this i owned it sold it bought it back because i liked

50:02.800 --> 50:07.080
it. What do you do in this game? It's snowboarding? It's snowboarding. The only thing that turned

50:07.080 --> 50:10.000
me off about it is because it didn't have live support, because it would have been pretty

50:10.000 --> 50:14.460
sweet live. But it's your snowboarding game type thing. What's kind of cool about it is

50:14.460 --> 50:20.300
they have hang gliding in there as well, snowmobiles, sleds, which are pretty cool, and the sleds

50:20.300 --> 50:27.140
are fun. It's just a really weird game. The cut scenes are done with weird comics, sock

50:27.140 --> 50:31.260
puppets. Yeah, I see a little pink bunny on the back of the box there. That has my interest

50:31.260 --> 50:35.060
It's really acid trippy, it reminds me of like MTV2 or something like that.

50:35.060 --> 50:36.060
But um...

50:36.060 --> 50:37.500
Like Wondershosen or something?

50:37.500 --> 50:40.820
Very yeah, very Wondershosen-ish.

50:40.820 --> 50:45.560
It's a fun game and you know, if you get a chance to go get a game, because there isn't

50:45.560 --> 50:48.900
really too much coming out in these next few months, check it out, they've actually dropped

50:48.900 --> 50:53.900
the price down to $39.99 now, and so it's really cheap, you can go find it and it's

pretty easy achievement points in there and it's got a terrain editor which is

51:19.060 --> 51:21.760
kind of neat over three hundred new audio tracks

51:21.760 --> 51:24.860
that's a lot of that's a lot of music i haven't heard all the audio tracks it's

51:24.860 --> 51:26.860
It's a lot to listen to. It's a lot of independent rock.

51:26.860 --> 51:27.860
Hey, that's fine.

51:27.860 --> 51:30.860
I'm a supporter of Indie Rock. I think that's a good thing.

51:30.860 --> 51:32.860
But it's worth checking out.

51:32.860 --> 51:34.860
Just send an email to snow at orangeontrader dot com.

51:34.860 --> 51:40.860
And not snowboard, we have to think of a word that you actually have to be listening to the show to hear.

51:40.860 --> 51:43.860
So snow at orangeontrader dot com if you want to win a copy of AMP 3.

51:43.860 --> 51:46.860
The Xbox 360, so you have to be a 360 owner.

51:46.860 --> 51:49.860
The game won't do you much good otherwise, I'm sorry to say.

51:49.860 --> 51:53.860
But hey, if you don't have a 360, I was actually at Fry's today and they had some there.

51:53.860 --> 51:56.980
oh they're making they're making their way around now you can get you can get a

51:56.980 --> 52:01.180
360 now yeah so just to clarify some folks in our chat room are saying is

52:01.180 --> 52:07.300
this for ps2 no this is Xbox 360 amp 3 you might is amp 2 and amp 1 those are

52:07.300 --> 52:11.220
and those are Xbox I think just regular I don't think you get those on ps2 it's

52:11.220 --> 52:14.940
made by 2k games who also made topspin 2 which I talked about earlier in the show

52:14.940 --> 52:19.860
all right we can't wait to give stuff away next week we'll be pulling for not

52:19.860 --> 52:23.580
just that but the 24 game we gave away in part a and if you missed it listen to

52:23.580 --> 52:27.180
Part A, because we'll tell you how to win the 24 game.

52:27.180 --> 52:29.020
Loki,

52:29.020 --> 52:30.600
Laura Croft.

52:30.600 --> 52:33.800
I bashed the Tomb Raider demo earlier in the show, but at least there's some good

52:33.800 --> 52:34.820
news coming

52:34.820 --> 52:36.280
Laura Croft's way.

52:36.280 --> 52:38.440
Yes, Laura Croft,

52:38.440 --> 52:41.800
don't ask me why, I really don't know why,

52:41.800 --> 52:46.680
she was actually, she's earned a Guinness World Record as the most successful

52:46.680 --> 52:49.160
video game heroine.

52:49.160 --> 52:50.680
To which I ask,

52:50.680 --> 52:57.680
what about Mrs. Pac-Man? Seriously. But apparently, what kind of a fucking record is that anyways?

52:58.320 --> 53:02.520
That's not a record. She didn't eat the most chili dogs in the world. She didn't, you know,

53:02.520 --> 53:09.520
grow the longest, you know, whatever, carrot. I mean, she's just a fake person in a game.

53:10.120 --> 53:16.200
And so, okay, over the past 10 years, Lovecraft has sold, they've sold over 28 million games

53:16.200 --> 53:23.240
worldwide in the Tomb Raider series. It's appeared on stage with U2 and covers over

53:23.240 --> 53:30.320
200 magazines and more recently, of course, Angelina Jolie put out two really awful movies.

53:30.320 --> 53:36.560
And yeah, and they have, you know, even over, it's a 1 billion dollar industry with items

53:36.560 --> 53:43.140
from lunch boxes, soft drinks, motor vehicles receiving the Lara Croft brand treatment.

53:43.140 --> 53:48.820
What kind of fucking vehicle has, you know, Tomb Raider edition or something like that?

53:48.820 --> 53:53.100
I have not heard of that, but I don't know.

53:53.100 --> 53:56.580
All that news in the world did not make that demo any better, I'm sorry to say.

53:56.580 --> 53:57.580
And you know what?

53:57.580 --> 53:59.020
You know what I have to ask though?

53:59.020 --> 54:02.780
Is really, is Guinness Book losing like its edge?

54:02.780 --> 54:05.960
I mean are they just letting anyone come into this book nowadays?

54:05.960 --> 54:11.260
I mean even fake people, I mean I can understand if someone did a speed run through Tomb Raider

54:11.260 --> 54:14.260
Could we get a world record for something?

54:14.260 --> 54:16.900
How about most Guinness drank on a podcast?

54:16.900 --> 54:19.260
We might be able to do that.

54:19.260 --> 54:20.580
I'll join in for that one.

54:20.580 --> 54:21.460
Heck yeah.

54:21.460 --> 54:23.340
It's just like, really.

54:23.340 --> 54:25.500
I mean, it's a fake person.

54:25.500 --> 54:28.380
The fake person does not have a sex.

54:28.380 --> 54:29.500
All right.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.060
Let's go on over to the Skype line

54:31.060 --> 54:33.300
over at orangelaungeradio.com, click on interact with us,

54:33.300 --> 54:35.060
and see what our listeners have to say.

54:35.060 --> 54:36.340
And we're already getting some calls.

54:36.340 --> 54:37.460
Let's go to this first call.

54:37.460 --> 54:39.420
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

54:39.420 --> 54:40.060
Hey.

54:40.060 --> 54:41.460
Hi, who's this?

54:41.460 --> 54:42.300
This is Roz.

54:42.300 --> 54:43.460
Hello, Roz.

54:43.460 --> 54:46.100
What's on your mind?

54:46.100 --> 54:49.900
Well, once again, I'm sitting around playing Advanced Crack

54:49.900 --> 54:53.440
after being sick for all of last week, which

54:53.440 --> 54:54.380
is why I didn't call.

54:54.380 --> 54:57.740
Did you get Jamie sick?

54:57.740 --> 54:59.940
Maybe.

54:59.940 --> 55:00.700
All right.

55:00.700 --> 55:04.540
Well, what did you call in to talk to us about tonight?

55:04.540 --> 55:07.780
One of our stories you have some feedback to or anything?

55:07.780 --> 55:11.460
Well, we could talk about my wonderful e-penis if you'd like.

55:11.460 --> 55:14.900
It actually has a name and a holiday.

55:14.900 --> 55:17.780
I was actually going to suggest, because I remember

55:17.780 --> 55:20.460
you were mentioning about your large e-penis earlier,

55:20.460 --> 55:22.300
is it appropriate for me to be saying

55:22.300 --> 55:25.460
that girls who have a lot of achievement points on Xbox Live

55:25.460 --> 55:28.140
or other types of online accomplishments have an e-penis?

55:28.140 --> 55:29.060
Or is that sexist?

55:29.060 --> 55:29.820
Absolutely.

55:29.820 --> 55:30.980
All right, just making sure.

55:30.980 --> 55:32.100
It's absolutely acceptable.

55:32.100 --> 55:33.780
Mine has a name, actually.

55:33.780 --> 55:34.680
Oh.

55:34.680 --> 55:36.280
I call it General Grant.

55:36.280 --> 55:37.140
General Grant?

55:37.140 --> 55:41.220
Yes. Why do you call your E-Penis General Grant?

55:41.220 --> 55:45.580
It all started one night.

55:45.580 --> 55:50.380
I think it was actually March 29th,

55:50.380 --> 55:53.700
which is our made-up holiday.

55:53.700 --> 55:58.700
And I just came up with it. I just thought of the name.

55:58.700 --> 56:03.380
Yeah. You know what? There's some guys out there that name their,

56:03.380 --> 56:06.860
you know, I ain't talking about E, okay? They name their real deal.

56:06.860 --> 56:09.980
and usually it's just because, now I don't sorry

56:09.980 --> 56:14.300
but I usually it's just you know because they think of it one random night maybe

56:14.300 --> 56:16.460
when they're high or something I don't know but

56:16.460 --> 56:20.680
it comes it comes to them in a dream and suddenly

56:20.680 --> 56:24.860
it has a name. I can understand that.

56:24.860 --> 56:28.940
spiritsnarrow would like to point out in our chat room you named your E Penis

56:28.940 --> 56:30.320
you win the podcast

56:30.320 --> 56:33.900
congratulations and Jism would like to know, or Jism

56:33.900 --> 56:37.900
I hope it's not Gizm that might be bad. Gizm says.

56:37.900 --> 56:41.900
Sorry buddy, sorry, sorry.

56:41.900 --> 56:45.900
What am I listening to? Ha ha ha.

56:45.900 --> 56:49.900
You won the show and I just lost it.

56:49.900 --> 56:53.900
Thank you.

56:53.900 --> 56:57.900
Roz, anything else on your mind?

56:57.900 --> 57:01.900
Advanced Wars. Holy shit, it's so fun.

57:01.900 --> 57:07.100
put it down and maybe try some Kingdom Hearts 2? No? Maybe I'll stop for a while and play

57:07.100 --> 57:11.780
more Phoenix Wright, but I don't think I'll move from those two. Alright, well Phoenix

57:11.780 --> 57:18.780
Wright is a good game too. The thing with Kingdom Hearts is that my PS2 is dead. Like,

57:20.340 --> 57:25.260
really dead. In a couple short months the PS3 will be out and then the PS2 is bound

57:25.260 --> 57:31.180
to get a price cut. Yeah, that's probably a good thing for me because my PS2 is dead

57:31.180 --> 57:33.580
and I miss playing Akaji.

57:33.580 --> 57:36.280
Roz, you should beg and plead maybe our chatters.

57:36.280 --> 57:39.080
Maybe they'll take up a collection for a new PS2 for you.

57:39.080 --> 57:40.880
Offer to show them General Grant.

57:40.880 --> 57:42.880
Please, General Grant wants a PS2.

57:42.880 --> 57:44.980
Alright. Roz, I gotta let you go so we can get to another call,

57:44.980 --> 57:46.880
but thank you so much for calling in, okay?

57:46.880 --> 57:47.380
Okay, bye.

57:47.380 --> 57:49.280
Have a good one. Bye-bye.

57:49.280 --> 57:50.080
Alright, let's go to another call.

57:50.080 --> 57:51.280
We're getting hammered tonight, guys.

57:51.280 --> 57:52.280
I'm not gonna be able to get to everybody.

57:52.280 --> 57:53.280
I'm so sorry.

57:53.280 --> 57:54.580
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

57:54.580 --> 57:58.180
Who's this?

57:58.180 --> 58:00.780
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

58:00.780 --> 58:05.120
slam that door. Who's this? Hi, this is Spirit Snare.

58:05.120 --> 58:09.720
Hi Spirit Snare, what's on your mind? Why did you have to shut the door there?

58:09.720 --> 58:11.120
Were you afraid somebody was going to hear me?

58:11.120 --> 58:15.040
That was my brother actually.

58:15.040 --> 58:19.080
Tell them to stop being a brat. What's on your mind?

58:19.080 --> 58:22.120
About Guitar Hero being innovative.

58:22.120 --> 58:26.760
I was actually surprised that you didn't...

58:26.760 --> 58:29.760
you guys didn't like... you guys weren't

58:29.760 --> 58:33.560
outraged like whatchamacallit

58:33.560 --> 58:37.280
back when it was announced over at the

58:37.280 --> 58:42.000
game developers conference at ETH when guitar hero was first announced at

58:42.000 --> 58:42.680
E3

58:42.680 --> 58:46.880
when guitar hero was announced as being the most innovative at the

58:46.880 --> 58:47.680
GDC

58:47.680 --> 58:51.280
oh yeah what do you think about that Loki you remember how guitar hero won the

58:51.280 --> 58:53.340
prize of most innovative among many

58:53.340 --> 58:57.640
other awards guitar heroes won this year he's making a

58:57.640 --> 59:01.720
Jerk off motion with his hand there. That's that's lovely. It's retarded. Let me put that I

59:02.560 --> 59:07.760
You know what low-key? I think you're in the minority. I think a lot of people think but I will say this though. I think

59:09.080 --> 59:10.260
amplitude

59:10.260 --> 59:15.580
Frequency should have been given more of those types of honors. I mean this is kind of like okay

59:15.580 --> 59:22.000
You know how the Grammys have a best new artist category every year and sometimes the person who wins the best new artist

59:22.140 --> 59:27.500
This is actually like their fifth album, but it's like they're just now getting noticed right you know what I mean

59:27.500 --> 59:31.820
yeah that's kind of what this reminds me of is it's like okay it's not really a

59:31.820 --> 59:37.100
new concept but they did it so well this time we're gonna notice them that's

59:37.100 --> 59:43.460
exactly what this is like to me so yeah but even though well even even though

59:43.460 --> 59:51.500
guitar fix was like released like even though guitar fix was released like way

59:51.500 --> 59:58.380
ahead of their time you know even though like it's a con it's a mixed up concept

59:58.380 --> 01:00:05.740
and stuff that really shouldn't have deserved the award well I guess

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:09.260
everybody is open to their own opinion anything else you want to share with us

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:13.940

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:17.900
okay thank you have a good one thanks for listening all right let's go to

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.820
orange lounge radio hi it's guy it's me Raven's dolphin hello Raven's dolphin

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:36.360
what's on your mind buddy I just want to comment on that achievement points yes

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:45.480
what do you want to say well I hate them why do you hate them I only have 630 and

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.800
All my friends got 1,300.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.200
I have 900.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.360
I have more than you, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.440
Oh, that's just great.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.080
Is that the only reason you're upset is because you have

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.960
a few points, whereas a lot of people have more?

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.040
No, I'm just way too poor to buy $60 games.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.440
What about the cheapy little $5 and $10 games

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.200
you can get on Xbox Live?

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.000
Feeding Frenzy, 75 easy, easy points.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.800
Crystal quest probably a hundred easy points right there

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:21.040
I'm saving my Microsoft points for Street Fighter. I want to kick someone's ass. There you go

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:26.000
You know Street Fighter is finally supposed to be coming out and I think April finally that will come out

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.080
But of course they've been saying this, you know for three months now, but if they're gonna fix the lag, I guess it's a good thing

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.840
Yeah, that's what I'm excited for but

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:40.840
Can I say one more thing?

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.840
Of course.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.840
Can I say one more thing?

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.840
Okay.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.520
There's a little bit of lag.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.240
The Mac boot camp thing?

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.240
Mm-hmm.

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.800
The Mac boot camp thing?

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.440
I think it's the greatest thing that Mac ever did, supporting Windows.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.440
Yay.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.440
All right.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.440
Yay indeed.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.840
You can call me a hypocrite for nothing.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.840
All right.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.520
No, I won't call you a hypocrite.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.520
I think it's a smart move for Mac as well

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.640
All right have a good box guy have a good one Ravens dolphin

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.560
See ya

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.000
We're getting a little bit of lag there with Ravens dolphin. Maybe we'll do one more call

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.720
I do want to say real fast though. Um, somebody said in chat room. Let's see

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:24.080
Where is it? Oh, it really is pronounced jism. That's how you say that name. It's short for

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.960
Neologism so it's actually pronounced jism. So I said the name right the first time I know I do not have something dirty on the brain

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.360
You you freaking perverts. I don't even have faith. I don't even know what you're talking about

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.680
I don't even know what you're talking about. That's how pure my soul is

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.600
Okay, we're gonna pick up one more call

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.800
I'm doing this completely at random because everybody in chat is yelling me to pick up their call

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.480
But I'm just gonna pick up a random call. Hello. You're on orange on radio. Hi. Hi. Who's this?

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:40.800

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.480
you spoil it I'll fly out to new Connecticut and choke you how is the

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.640
ending it's it's good it's kind of similar to the first one though mm-hmm

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.880
Um in the sense that it ends with the king sending him a letter I

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.960
Said don't ruin the damn thing

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.640
Right, that's not spoiler. All right, fine

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:07.640
But yeah, it's it's good. Um, the last boss battle is very good. It kind of had a wind waker like vibe to it in a

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.640
way

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:14.520
Um, you know the way you killed off Ganondorf in the end. They had it kind of had a similar like really flashy

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.520
Oh, you spoiled Wind Waker for me!

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.520
Shut up!

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:24.520
Alright, was it worth the $50 you paid for it?

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:31.520
Honestly, I don't think video games at all are worth $50, but I certainly had a great time with it.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:36.520
It was only like 30 hours, but it was a good 30 hours.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:40.520
There were a few bosses I didn't like because they were really annoying.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.520
Did you spend 3 hours on the prologue?

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.660
yes so that means 10 percent of the game is the prologue

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:50.680
yep that's amazing spike you had a question okay so

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.660
my question for you is did you get the hidden video at the end

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:58.960
no but I saw it before it even came out

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.040
on the internet I heard it it's

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:05.360
I can't even say I don't want to spoil but I heard it's

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.600
it's what the hidden video in part one did for part two

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:12.200
are you banning me from asking my question on the air?

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:17.240
You cannot spoil the game or many people will kill you.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.240
Send Spike an email.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:21.640
You guys, you kids can Kingdom Hearts it out an email, okay?

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.840
If you want to see the secret ending, just go to YouTube.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.840
I know, yeah.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:28.160
I've seen it and I have some speculation about it, but...

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.400
We can't spoil, though.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.400
We can't.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.440
It's like all over the GameFAQs message board.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.860
Can you make it spoiler-free somehow?

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.320
I wouldn't be able to for what I want to say.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.320
Alright.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.320
Zander, Zander, we gotta let you go before something gets spoiled, okay?

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:43.820
Okay.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:44.820
Have a good one.

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:45.820
Ansem's still alive.

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:46.320
Alright.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.820
I didn't even hear what he said, what did he say?

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.820
He said Ansem's still alive.

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:54.820
You dick.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.320
I lied, we'll do one more call.

01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:01.320
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:03.820
Hello.

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:07.300
Hi, I lied. I lied. We decided to take one more call. What's on your mind?

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:17.380
Well, oh yeah that I'm sick, I'm sorry to hear that what does that have to do with tonight's show

01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:22.780
No, I'm sure you get better soon. You know, obviously something's going around. Okay, seriously, what's on your mind?

01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:28.020
Okay, um, it's bothering me. You guys keep saying yen. It's pronounced N. I'm

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.000
Say oh, oh the currency

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.260
in Japan

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:36.900
Mm-hmm. Well, you see I'm a honky who can't pronounce Japanese words, right?

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:41.840
You know, I'll go you want to go out from some for some sushi. What do we get some sushi?

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:47.940
And some teriyaki can I get some teriyaki chicken

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:56.180
Yeah, all right, so I make mistakes it's you know what that's why I'm on the internet radio and not on real radio, okay

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.100
Anything else you anything else you want to say besides picking on me

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:04.100
Yes, this is Nintendo Maniac 64.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:07.100
Well, hi Nintendo Maniac 64!

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:11.100
Or, as I say, Fever Maniac 64.

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.100
Anything else on your mind tonight before I cut you off?

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:19.100
Yeah, my DS charger cable. I've modded it so I have headphone jacks on the cord.

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:28.100
I can plug in my AC adapter, a USB port, or, get this, a mouse port. Plug.

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:30.100
I'm impressed.

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:32.100
Resident Evil 4, bitch.

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:35.100
Bye! Alright then.

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.100
Get better soon.

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:42.100
What is up with the colors tonight?

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:45.100
Hey, I just wanted to talk, man.

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.100
I'm sick, dude!

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:52.100
Do you know what I fucking did with my mouse this week?

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:57.100
I spent 30 hours on Kingdom Hearts this week!

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.100
Now, my E-Penis is huge!

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.100
I have a question for you.

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.100
God, I love our fans.

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.100
Yes, love you.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.100
Awesome.

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:10.820
So, USB port and mouse port, what's the point?

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.340
Because you can- Why do you install Linux on a toaster?

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.340
Because you can.

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.100
But you can't hook up a mouse to it.

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.100
Huh?

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:25.100
I mean, like, if I installed a cigarette lighter on my PSP, but I don't smoke.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.540
you would have it

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:29.940
for what

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:34.180
all right we're gonna go around and get tonight's last-minute stories any last

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:36.860
minute things people want to bring up loki you seem to always have something

01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:40.500
uh... yeah i was gonna mention uh...

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.700
there's a some rumors stuff i was reading

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.540
one of them saying that final fantasy seven the remake is in production for

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.220
the ps3 right now

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:51.940
uh... that the trend also secured rights for grand theft auto the next grand theft auto

01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:54.620
for the 360 to be exclusive

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:59.500
which is not going to happen and how God was the other one

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.700
that's all I got so far

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:06.780
alright I have a real last minute story here

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:10.420
this is coming to us from GK 128 in the chat room there's a post over on

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.580
Nintendo forums

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:16.400
rumors going around that blue wave may perhaps be the real name of the

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.360
revolution

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:21.140
I take into consideration the revolution has a blue light

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:25.180
there's waving the controller there's the blue ocean thing people been talking

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:25.660
about

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:30.780
a competition to blu-ray perhaps this leak is coming from some type of audio

01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:33.140
link there from your file host dot com

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:36.220
I check that out in our chat room was just posted the link there I'm sure if

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:39.020
this is true they'll be plenty of more news about in the next week

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:42.900
right now take it as a rumor the name of the revolution to be the blue wave

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:46.140
possibly I don't know your target sounding I'm sorry

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:50.940
I I could see I could see it I could see that my problem is retarded

01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:54.900
is you're making it out to me. Spike? I really like the name Revolution.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:58.540
I do too. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I think that should be the name of it too.

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:02.780
I mean, because it's revolutionary, it's...

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.980
I don't know, you can revolve the controller around.

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:09.020
I'm doing little quotation marks with my fingers here.

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:12.300
It's catchy and buzzy.

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:15.620
I think that it's exactly what Nintendo needs to turn their image around,

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:17.900
something that's going to make people say, hey wait, this

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:22.100
is different. Possibly. Any other last-minute stories?

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:27.180
Spike, do you have something? Well, on Friday, actually, Capcom announced the Capcom

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.260
Classics Collection Reloaded.

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:32.860
It's the follow-up compilation disc for PlayStation 2 and

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:37.080
Xbox. Right now the titles that have been announced for it are

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:41.860
Eco Fighters, King of Dragons, Knights of the Round, also looks like some Commando,

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:42.660
Ghosts and

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:45.660
Ghosts and Ghosts, and Street Fighter 2.

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:49.360
some of those games were in the last one

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:52.940
that's kinda weird I don't I don't I don't get this press release but it's

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.020
there on the internet

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:57.340
Kotaku posted a link, IGN posted a link

01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:01.060
seems pretty kosher but

01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:04.740
Resident Evil 4 bitch

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:08.260
any other last minute stories?

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:11.460
just the one I have

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:14.800
I also want to say really quick because somebody in the chat room reminded me to mention

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:18.980
our panels at Fanime. Yes, we are going to be going to Fanime. We're doing panels that's

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:23.280
still in the works. StarkSakura would know more about that. Just a reminder, that's Memorial

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:28.200
Day weekend. Not only are we going to be there, but Spike, you're going to Fanime as well,

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.520
correct? You're going to be there?

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.540
Oh yeah, I'm there just about every year.

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:34.360
And you'll be at our panels as well? Hopefully?

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.360
Sure.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.080
Please? Yes. And, well, you'll at least be there. I don't know what we're doing for them

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.080
yet.

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.080
Yeah, I'll be present.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.180
He'll be there to sign autographs. And hopefully some of our other regulars. I know Extrafur

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:49.620
will probably be there, and maybe we can get Miklataub to come with us too. We'll see.

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:51.620
That'll all go down in front of me.

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:53.360
Okay, I have one more thing.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.360
One more?

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.180
Yeah, this is basically coming from the new issue of Game Informer. First off, they're

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:03.060
sticking by their information that the new Halo game is going to be called Forerunner.

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:10.300
They also revealed that a Project Orion is in existence, and basically it's supposed

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:16.780
a team put together to explore the possibility of a Halo MMO, and it's still in the planning

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:19.980
stages but it's going ahead.

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:26.720
Also the Final Fantasy VII Remake for the PlayStation 3 is supposed to be going to have

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:32.100
the Final Fantasy XII action battle system in there, so you're going to be in a real

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:37.100
time battle with some armors until we see some actual details.

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:41.700
Alright, that's about going to wrap it up for tonight's program, but not before we get

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.460
to the last story of the evening, which comes to us from Loki.

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:50.100
We were going to make Jamie talk about this, but maybe this is why she called in tonight,

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.100
I don't know.

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.940
Well, I wanted to first, real quick, before I go over the last story, I just want to mention

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:56.420
what's coming out this week.

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:57.580
Oh sure.

01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:04.660
If you are a PC Gamer fan, they have Auto Assault Online Limited Edition with some bonus

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:05.660
stuff.

01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:11.820
finally coming out on the PC. Stacked, the poker game, is coming out which is interesting

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:20.340
since the console version has been delayed until May. Let's see, nothing on the DS. Game

01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:25.340
Boy Advance only has crap coming out this week. GameCube though has Odama which is kind

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:33.180
of strange. You know, feudal military strategy mixed with pinball. So that's an odd one.

01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:38.120
On PlayStation 2, you've got a new Monster Rancher game, Monster Rancher Evo, Samurai

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:45.000
Champloo Side Trek, which is actually I think being developed by the people that did Killer7.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.760
Tomb Raider Legend is going to be available on all systems, including the 360 and the

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.760
Xbox.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.360
I guess no GameCube until later this year.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:01.080
Of course on the PSP, we have the Silent Hill experience coming out that coincided with

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.800
the movie released next week.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.180
It must have bumped that up.

01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:06.020
I believe they have.

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:12.600
If I remember, Silent Hill, Silent Hill Experience, I thought that around that time was supposed

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.800
to be not the Silent Hill Experience, but the collection.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.800
Hmm, interesting.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:20.140
But I haven't really heard anything official on that, so I don't know, maybe.

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:24.740
So look for that if, you know, see if it's coming.

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:28.700
Of course, yeah, I'm not too sure about these release dates, because it said Stacks is supposed

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.720
to be coming out on the 11th and that's not right.

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:37.520
But King of Fighters Neo Wave here, King of Fighters fan, and on the 360 MLB 2K6, only

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.680
baseball game out there on the 360.

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:44.520
Battlefield 2 is supposed to be pretty good, and Tomb Raider Legend on the fence.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:48.440
And I don't think DarkSakura would mind me stealing her European release dates, because

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:51.260
she always talks about that for our friends in the UK.

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:54.960
If you're over in the UK, you've got coming out this week on the 13th, Dragon Quest, Journey

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:55.960
of the Cursed King.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.080
If you're an RPG fan, you must get this, PlayStation 2.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:04.140
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Double Team coming out on the DS, The Sims 2 expansion family

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:08.920
fun stuff on the PC, Auto Assault also making its way to the PC, and SEGA is bringing out

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:14.300
Football Manager 2006 on the Xbox 360 and the PSP, I believe that is the hard drive

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.300
required title.

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:16.300
Yes it is.

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:17.300
For the 360 isn't it?

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:18.300
Yes.

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:22.320
Next week you guys have to look forward to Final Fantasy 11 on PC and Xbox 360, that

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.400
would be the Treasures of Ot Organ of course.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:29.080
not yes that's right that is coming out next week for no no I'm sorry that is

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.080
the following week yes it's the following week now I'm into the week at

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:35.600
the 20th and 21st and on the 21st you guys are getting electroplankton over in

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.520
the UK Tamagotchi on the DS and Tetris DS is also making his way the DS might I

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:45.320
also say on the 20th you guys are scheduled to get 99 nights lucky we're

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:50.360
not getting that for a while I don't believe that we'll see that's what the

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.200
list says that's what i'm reading so take that with a grain of salt but uh...

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:58.280
big grain of salt all right well that's what the list says that's just what i'm reading off of

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:01.560
maybe you guys you know it's not uncommon for folks in the uk to once in a while get a game

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:05.560
before us so i wouldn't i wouldn't uh... wait who's bringing that over because if that might

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:11.160
be ubisoft they might be releasing i closed the list yeah i think it is ubisoft so oh shoot

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:16.840
whatever anyways it's hold on i'm looking we've got um

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:21.280
Microsoft is publishing it

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:27.480
huh that's interesting yep alright now we're gonna get into the final story of

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:28.000
the night

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.200
no we have a comment in a chat room there

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:36.640
I'm black with black wolf in our chair and says 99 nights is coming out in

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.360
Japan on April 20th not Europe

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.400
yeah I I'm more correct I just I'm

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.600
green list three way I don't go with Japan so I made a mistake

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:47.800
Okay, alright.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.600
Loki, last story of the night.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.640
Yes.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:55.040
Well, we've seen a lot of weird things come out.

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.480
This I'm kind of...

01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:00.160
I don't think it actually ties in with the actual

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.040
game, but

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:08.040
if you're in Japan and you happen to be near a Japanese sex toy shop,

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.640
you can find a Kingdom Heart

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:12.800
vibrator.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:16.480
Yes, the Kingdom Hearts AC.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:31.360
It's selling a Kingdom Hearts branded rabbit vibrator. Of course, it doesn't look like it has anything to do with Kingdom Hearts, except for the name, maybe a brand name or something, but I don't know.

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:36.400
It's something to get those Kingdom Hearts hardcore fans out there that they might not already own.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:41.960
Now you too can join organization 69.

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.280
I want one. Put this on your little black hood.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:49.360
this is something to get those people that have the trans vibrator and can't

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:52.760
think of you know anything else gaming-related to get. This reminds me of the Hello Kitty

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:53.320
vibrator.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.800
I want to know how long it's gonna take for fan art with key blades with

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:00.040
these dangling from the end on the chain.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:05.600
Really? And Dirty Thief just got the quote of the show there in our chat room.

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.920
It's a key blade that unlocks your pleasure.

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:11.960
They win at the internet.

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:15.200
I think Dirty Thief ought to be marketing this show to the masses out there.

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:19.400
Please, if you guys do want to market the show to the masses, we really appreciate it.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.880
That's the only way we get big is word of mouth.

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:25.900
We don't have no big magazine company back in our show.

01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:29.000
We don't have no big website that backs our show.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
We are independent.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.760
We're as independent as it gets.

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.640
We are out of the spare bedroom of my apartment doing this program and we need word of mouth.

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.640
That's right.

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.640
I'm wagging my face.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.800
The way your head is moving, I wish I could show the audience at home.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.800
Well, we're hoping to do the video thing soon enough.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.000
Sorry, I didn't get any video this time.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.780
Just check it out on OLRPSP.com and huge, huge video things to come.

01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:53.140
We're very, very excited.

01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:54.360
And I guess that's that.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.940
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:59.420
Your final thought, Spike.

01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:00.940
Why did I have to go first?

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.840
Loki, your final thought.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:05.860
My lap is on fire because of this laptop.

01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:10.640
My final thought is Resident Evil 4, bitch!

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.640
Have a great week.

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:33.260
See you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.640
You get to fight, fight
