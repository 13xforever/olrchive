00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,920
Tonight, April 23, 2006, Loki spills tentative release dates for Sony games, many companies

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,960
begin announcing their E3 plans, and Kid Whatever, musician from In the Groove, joins us to talk

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,960
about the game and his new CD.

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,480
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,660
edition of Orange Lounge Radio. This is episode number

6
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:44,680
182 for this April the 23rd, 2006.

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,980
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky, not joining us tonight. Dark

8
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,320
Soccer, also known as Jamie Summers, she is off tonight for her birthday

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,940
and I can say I did attend her birthday festivities. We went to Dave and Busters last

10
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,840
night in the Bay Area

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,400
and watched her get mighty drunk and it was a good time.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,640
So she's recovering today. She probably has a little bit of a hangover. No, I guess she

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,000
doesn't really get hangovers

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,040
or at least she claims not to, but she's up to no good

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,200
either way. And she also gets to be

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,320
lazy next week because next week we are not going to be having a show because of

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,480
our other co-host right over there, Loki. Yes. What did you do now?

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,000
I have to go get married.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's right.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,920
Loki's getting married next Sunday.

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Congratulations in advance.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,520
So we're not going to be here next Sunday because Jamie and I are obviously going to

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,920
the wedding, so we won't be able to do the show.

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,400
However, stay tuned to the podcast stream.

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,240
We will have something for you guys.

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,440
We're cooking up, but we will not be here live, I'm sorry to say.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,200
However, there will be playing live an old classic episode, maybe something that's been

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,960
in popular demand for a little while to be replayed now involving a certain karaoke episode.

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
We'll see.

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,040
I have to dig it up if I can find it.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,340
I may have to actually talk to one of our people that archived this show, like Misty

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,800
or Angel or something, see if I can dig it up, so we'll see.

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:07,720
For the prosperity of the show, I suppose I could give you the recordings.

34
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,520
We are here to talk about video games that you guys really want to know about, try to

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,480
avoid things that suck.

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,680
One thing that the critics thought really sucked was the Silent Hill movie that came

37
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,680
out this week.

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,160
Of course we have been talking and talking about this movie for a long time hyping this up on the show

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,240
Loki did it deliver did it disappoint? What'd you think? Well their excuse was um that they couldn't figure out what was going on the plot

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,520
I don't know. I

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,120
Seemed critics seemed pretty straightforward to me. I don't know

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,440
Yeah, see it didn't

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,960
I I think the plot was when of course we're trying to make this spoiler free

44
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,520
So let's be good and not spoil this for anybody because not everybody's seen this but I think the plot

45
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,300
It is open to interpretation, especially at the end, because there have been arguments

46
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,020
on LiveJournal back and forth between me and other people on what the ending really represents,

47
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,260
and does it mean one thing versus another thing.

48
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:06,020
I think any movie that can get you to talk about it long after you've seen it is a good

49
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,180
movie.

50
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,820
I think movies are things you should be able to talk about.

51
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,840
There are movies of different entertainment values.

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,900
movies like you know take Terminator okay that's just bang bang shoot him up

53
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,500
there's nothing to really talk about that's a different type of entertainment

54
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,800
yeah but you know Silent Hill was a different type of film what do you think

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,300
though overall you like it didn't like it it was okay it was okay yeah I is

56
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,660
cool I don't know I've really watched that many video game movies so I can't

57
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,940
really say if it's no better or worse than any of them but I would I would say

58
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:47,640
It's definitely we're seeing it's not bad and it's I think it's pretty good actually even for just a horror movie. It was pretty good

59
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,180
My whole complaint the whole movie is just towards the end. It's a little weird

60
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,620
It's like the second half of the second half starts to fizzle out for me to be honest

61
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:03,100
What I want to know why wasn't pyramid heads name in the closing credits because he was the fucking star of the movie

62
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,420
Honestly, I realized he was only in like two three scenes, but he stole the movie

63
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,500
He really did you anybody you didn't even have to play the games to know that that pyramid thing is

64
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,260
The scariest thing in the whole movie

65
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,060
I mean seriously cuz you know

66
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,860
I think a lot of you guys have heard about one scene in particular

67
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,360
But I won't say it to spoil it for you guys, but that's not the only like scary moment

68
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,340
I mean, there's another scene that's just like really freaky and I'll tell you what the sound

69
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,240
When pyramid head walks and the sword scraping on the ground

70
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:39,040
like it was just awesome that was pretty cool I thought that the monsters were

71
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,080
done very well it was very very true to you know the whole storyline so that's

72
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:52,320
good it was just it was it was well done it wasn't like some crappy you know it's

73
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,960
just a really crappy movie right what do you think best video game movie ever um

74
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:05,060
well I don't know I mean after all double dragon was pretty good it was it

75
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,400
was um so far is pretty good I wouldn't I don't know if it's gonna be the best

76
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,780
ever but um I liked it it was definitely a very strong start who cares if the

77
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,620
critics don't like it most of the critics didn't know what they were

78
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,300
talking about and we're comparing just saying stupid stuff granted the dialogue

79
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,340
sucked okay yeah the dialogue was my biggest problem with a movie we'll give

80
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,060
them that the plot not being able to be understood it was pretty straightforward

81
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,220
me I was even looking at it in a sense how how could you confuse this I didn't

82
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,780
know I was nearly as bad as critics me I don't I don't understand how they could

83
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,260
be confused at that stuff I personally think they didn't try or this didn't

84
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,180
care something somebody said in my life journal which you know had me thinking a

85
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,060
little bit was the dialogue intentionally bad to be like the games

86
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,940
maybe there were there were some parts that was like

87
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,060
huh why is why is this like

88
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,020
me it seemed like part of the game then there is even some things they're saying

89
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,100
that was like puzzle solving like the game

90
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,820
yeah a little bit stuff so there is it I don't think that's appropriate for a

91
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,600
movie I understand there's that certain fanservice to like make it feel like the

92
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,060
game

93
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,540
but come on pyramid head was fanservice okay pyramid head was not in the

94
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,420
original Silent Hill

95
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,980
but they made it work in the movie and it was phenomenal and it just makes you

96
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,160
want more Pyramid Head

97
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,880
so that was fan service I didn't need the movie to feel like the video game to

98
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,380
be I mean in in in a way it did feel like the game

99
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,860
in everything outside of dialogue like the the fog

100
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,040
ambience and the characters were very Silent Hill and the monsters were

101
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,140
awesome and you know all that stuff I think it was just

102
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,900
it was cool I would have liked to have seen less of

103
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,500
The cult stuff towards the end and more of just the beginning movie. They took the beginning the movie kind of

104
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,060
Doubled that that would have been a really good move. Tell me that siren thing. Isn't the freakiest thing though. I was awesome

105
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,060
It was cool

106
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Yeah, it's just I don't know

107
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,140
All right

108
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,460
I think the first monsters that you see were I thought were the scariest but they're at least the creepiest

109
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,260
I mean, but I don't know that's just me. I and again just for my thoughts

110
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,180
I wasn't like OMG best movie ever and the movie wasn't without its you know, pretty big flaws

111
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,940
But I thought it was good and you know, it's really violent

112
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,860
It totally delivers on the violence and blood and gore thing and it's pretty freaky. It's a different type of scare

113
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,860
It's not slasher movies scary. It's like

114
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,580
WTF question mark exclamation point scary. That's the type of movie you're gonna get so I think it's a good time

115
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,400
It's where it's worth your money at least a matinee if you're too poor to do the you know

116
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,460
$9 $10, you know at night which oh my gosh was what like 1050 to go see the movie

117
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,160
I think no 1025 a ticket because we bought the fandango thing which is you know makes it even more money

118
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,680
Yeah, sucky. We don't even live in that expense. I mean if you if we'd seen it in San Francisco, New York City

119
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
LA would have been even more

120
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Kind of sad. All right

121
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,840
Anyway, also joining us tonight. Say hello to make sure the mics on over there the 23rd magus also known as Andrew

122
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, it's been a while. It has been a little while since you've been on the program

123
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Not much else to say about it

124
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,080
Just been away for a long time. Sorry your volumes been pretty bad. I'm just suggesting on the fly there. All right

125
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,580
How's this? They're much better. All right, awesome. Sounds good

126
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,520
So you used to come on the show a lot back in the old days when we weren't doing the podcast thing when we were

127
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,520
Just like a live only thing. Yeah

128
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,800
it was big fun. It was a good time. Back when the show wasn't like kind of crappy like it

129
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,360
is now when it was just plain crappy back in the day. It was broke down ghetto Bamani

130
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,920
radio. Exactly. Well we don't do the Bamani thing. Well I mean we do. We have big music

131
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,600
game thing now. We actually have a special guest tonight who is a big part of music games.

132
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,800
Not Bamani but music games. And we still definitely do our tribute once in a while to music games

133
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,160
but we try to think everything. Yeah, we think as a whole.

134
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Yeah. We're video game fans first, music games is just a subset of that.

135
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,280
Because if we only talked about music games, we wouldn't be able to talk about Silent Hill or

136
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,520
Final Fantasy or Katamari. If you're into music games, though, you should definitely pick up this

137
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,000
month's official PlayStation magazine. They have demos for

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,200
Rez, Amplitude, Guitar Man, and

139
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,280
some other game, I don't remember. Uh-huh.

140
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,320
Aren't all these games kinda old? Yeah, they're doing some feature on music games or something.

141
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,080
Somehow I think they got reprinted. I managed to pick up Rez and Guitarman.

142
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,880
They were marketed as used at a local GameStop.

143
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,600
Yes, I don't know. They've been having a lot of the

144
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,440
older games just suddenly popping up on shelves everywhere.

145
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,400
I have no idea why. You know, Rez would make a good PSP game.

146
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,920
It would. Alright, speaking of games, I'd like to start off the show with a little bit of

147
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,920
how was your gaming week? What kind of stuff have you been playing? What have you

148
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,360
been into? Loki, start us off.

149
00:09:51,360 --> 00:10:02,360
I've been playing, well mainly today, I've been playing Mutant Storm Reloaded or whatever that is, and that game is pretty cool.

150
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,360
I'm trying to go through the, what was it, it's not the adventure mode, the other one.

151
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:18,440
one anyways so I was trying to get up there I'm like rank 2445 or something

152
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,380
now because I I actually have to play through the game I didn't realize you

153
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:28,320
get more points we played on black belt and stuff so I've been playing everything

154
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:36,480
I'm up through like oh man I want to say like 65 on yellow belt and then I'm just

155
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,320
starting to replay them all again on Black Belt. The difficulty gets friggin' annoying

156
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,800
just in some of the games. But I'm getting there, so it should turn out pretty well.

157
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,680
And then, I've been playing Burnout again today, and that game I really don't like the

158
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:59,560
rubber band AI. It's really pissing me off. For example, I crashed one of the cars into

159
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,840
the wall. And I'm in first place, about to beat everything. All of a sudden they spawn

160
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,960
the car in front of me on the other side of like this jump and so I crashed into

161
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,440
the car and then they win I'm like what the fuck was that and so it's just

162
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,680
ridiculous stuff like that the other thing I've been playing of course we

163
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,340
started doing team games in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories and this is

164
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,080
where the game starts to fall apart not necessarily in the fact that team games

165
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,960
suck on it because team games are really fun and actually kind of made the whole

166
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,360
game new again, it's just that the programming that they did for the team games is so horrible

167
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,680
that you cannot, most of the time you can't get them to work. In fact, a lot of times

168
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,580
they'll spawn and you'll be a ball instead of a player, and you'll have to reboot the

169
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,400
whole thing, the whole thing will crash. So, you know, big fuck you to Rockstar for really

170
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,240
dropping a ball and programming the multiplayer in this game, it just completely makes it

171
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,240
unplayable sometimes. So, it's weird, because we have six players team games and it won't

172
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,680
work, but if you do six players just one-on-one, you know, everyone for themselves, it works

173
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
fine.

174
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,360
So, that doesn't make any sense at all, but, I don't know, I hope they fix this in the

175
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
next one.

176
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,480
Otherwise, someone's gonna need to be punched in the face.

177
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,680
And then, other than that, haven't really played too much else.

178
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,800
I tried playing a little bit more Rubble Roses XX and, I don't know, I'm gonna try playing

179
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,560
through the game just to get some more achievement points.

180
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:37,400
about it but you know and yeah that's pretty much it all right I've been

181
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,200
playing a couple games this week I checked out brain age on the DS train

182
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,600
your brain in minutes a day it's it's different it's not your typical kind of

183
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,920
game I think if you're going in expecting some type of 20 hours to be

184
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,880
type you know start to finish game you're gonna be a little bit

185
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,040
disappointed that's not the point behind brain training basically what it is is

186
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,120
that you've got a lot of little games like mini games

187
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,520
that you play and it's supposed to get you thinking it's supposed to get your

188
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,960
brain moving it's like brain exercises essentially

189
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,540
for instance one of the game is do 20 math problems as fast as you can

190
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,920
I know that sounds a little cheesy but it's actually kinda fun you know to like

191
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,240
get your brain moving and you have to be

192
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,280
a little bit nerdy I think to like it though because if you're just like

193
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,800
if you're like ew math you're probably not gonna get as big of a thrill out of it

194
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,400
which is cool because it recognizes your handwriting although if you have

195
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,560
crappy handwriting like me, you're gonna have some problems. For instances, I write

196
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,240
my eights. I don't write a big curve, like a big loop. I write two

197
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,440
little circles is how I've always written my eight. I know that makes me

198
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,240
sound retarded, but examine the way you write real fast. I bet you I'm not the

199
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,120
only one that does this. In fact, I know I'm not, because another person complained

200
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,280
about having the same problem. It picks up my eights zeros constantly, so I

201
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,200
had to force myself to write eights the way you're supposed to do it, so that was

202
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,720
tricky. The other problem the game has is with voice recognition there's another

203
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,600
game where

204
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,720
what you're supposed to do is that the name of a color will show up on the

205
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,880
screen like it'll say

206
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,200
red but then word will actually be written

207
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,160
either in the same color or a different color and you're supposed to say not the

208
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,840
word

209
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,320
but the color that the word is written in so it like messes with you a little

210
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
bit because even though it might say red

211
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,320
it's in black text you have to say black so you get either red

212
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,040
black yellow or blue well here's the thing the DS has a real hard time

213
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,680
recognizing

214
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,440
recognizing me saying blue like I'll say blue and it goes try again

215
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,360
blue try again blue and it still doesn't work and I'm not the only one that had

216
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,840
this problem my roommate had this problem I've listened to other people

217
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,240
review this game have the same problem

218
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,080
I have the fix for you this is how to get the game to recognize what you're

219
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,600
saying

220
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,480
because and I know this is gonna sound really wrong it's gonna sound really

221
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,320
really wrong

222
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,600
but it works if you don't believe me try it

223
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,920
instead of saying blue say brew

224
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,120
and it works. Just change your L's to an R

225
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,200
and it works. Why am I somehow not surprised? That is completely racist.

226
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,360
You know what? Do it. If you're having problems with the game,

227
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,960
recognize you saying blue. Try

228
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,760
brew brew brew and it'll work. It completely worked for me. It has not

229
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,760
misread me saying blue once yet.

230
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,840
ever since I started talking. I thought Phoenix Wright not recognizing objection was bad.

231
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,120
Exactly.

232
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,320
Alright, so the game is fun. It kinda reminds me of those old puzzle

233
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,360
books that you can get at the supermarket like games magazine I think

234
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,080
was one that would always have little puzzles in it

235
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,480
and the penny press and all those little things. If you like those types of things because

236
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,520
Sudoku is in the game too and you know Sudoku is really big in those magazines

237
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,640
I think you're really gonna like this. And I think it's just kind of a

238
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,880
it's really a groundbreaking game because you know it's been advertised in

239
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,240
Time magazine

240
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,660
and they're showing it on TV in these different style commercials

241
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,320
I think they're really trying to reach a different audience with this game so it's going to be

242
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,800
very interesting to see how well this game does

243
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,960
because they are not trying to reach your typical gamer and I'll tell you

244
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,680
most

245
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,460
typical gamers quote-unquote probably not the folks that listen to this show

246
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,920
but like when I say gamers like those that play like Madden and Halo shoot

247
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,360
em ups

248
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,440
exclusively that don't play a lot of their stuff probably aren't gonna like

249
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:19,800
this

250
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,280
this is definitely geared towards a different audience but I think it's a

251
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,120
good investment

252
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,280
twenty dollars is a pretty good price for a DS game

253
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,760
and you know what, eh, you get Sudoku which is you know really popular and all that

254
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,440
stuff even though it's a little bit overrated

255
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,200
it'll keep you busy for a long time or just buy it used when it

256
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,080
you know you'll probably see it used in a few weeks. For fifteen. Yeah.

257
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,280
So I got my, I would like to say I got my brain age down to 21

258
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,280
which is really as low as you can go as 20, but the first time I tested because it had

259
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,800
problems picking up blue,

260
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,080
I had to go BRU BRU. My brain age was like 54 or something the first time, it was kinda

261
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,880
sad. Anyway, heading on over to

262
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,280
www.orangelaundryradio.com, click on chat to hear from

263
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,760
our chatters. Let's see, DidYouLoseASock says

264
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,280
I'm dyslexic and I write all my letters backwards. The letters don't appear

265
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,840
backwards. I start and finish writing a letter different than normal people.

266
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:18,180
So, yeah, those of you that have a different style of writing things might be in for a

267
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,180
shock.

268
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,400
Now, I write my A's kind of funny.

269
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,120
I don't write my A's like most people do.

270
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,440
Most people do like an O with a tail.

271
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,260
I draw mine like a printed letter A, like an upside down E. That's how I write my A's.

272
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,800
And the game recognizes that, so at least I have that.

273
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,080
The game isn't totally stupid, but some of you guys that have weird handwriting things

274
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,800
are going to have some challenges there, so be careful.

275
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:47,360
Black Wolf, who also does a show over there on all games radio, Black Wolf says Sudoku

276
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,480
is just the side game, it's not part of the main brain age gameplay.

277
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,160
No, it's not a part of the main gameplay, but it does kind of fit along with that same

278
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,560
theme of exercise your brain, and when you go into it, it says Sudoku is a great way

279
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,780
to exercise the cortex part of your brain, all that stuff.

280
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,640
Even though it's like a side game, it fits into the same idea, so it's a little bonus.

281
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,380
Which makes the advertising of the game appropriate, I have that little sticker that says Sudoku

282
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,380
included.

283
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:24,300
Also the other game I played, this might surprise you, I love Final Fantasy XI, you know this,

284
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:30,320
I talk about it a lot on this program, I've invested far too many hours into this game,

285
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,340
it's an MMO that sucked away my life.

286
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,460
I'm going to give Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 a negative review.

287
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:44,140
Here's why, Final Fantasy XI on 360 is not going to work for your typical Xbox 360 gamer.

288
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,300
I feel like I have to give this a negative review because your typical 360 gamer is going

289
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:54,060
to get so pissed off trying to play this game because there are so many hurdles that you

290
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,180
have to clear.

291
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,900
And for a PC gamer, which is where I started the game, it's okay.

292
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:08,780
And for PlayStation 2, which didn't really have a good front end like Xbox Live, it worked

293
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,260
out okay to have that whole play online thing.

294
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:16,740
But for Xbox, where people are so used to being able to just go online and play right

295
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,640
away, this whole play online hurdle is a pain in the ass.

296
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,200
And I understand it's necessary to get the game to be compatible with PC and PlayStation

297
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
2.

298
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
I'm not an idiot.

299
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
I know why it's there.

300
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,720
It really cripples the game.

301
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,940
I'm telling you, you cannot turn on this game and just go and play.

302
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,680
It takes literally, I'm going to time it.

303
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,440
We're going to put a video up on the website.

304
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,960
I'm going to time it and show you that it takes well over a minute from the time you

305
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,440
turn on your Xbox for you to actually log into the game.

306
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,020
That is really annoying.

307
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,400
I'm sorry, there's no easy way to just get in there and go.

308
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,600
You've got to go through that ugly play online thing, which really, they need some type of

309
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,800
quick button or something where I just go right into Final Fantasy 11 and start

310
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,120
with my primary character or something. Here's the other thing I was so excited

311
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,960
to play Final Fantasy 11 on my HDTV because you know widescreen and don't

312
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,120
get me wrong the game is very very pretty and it looks very nice is very

313
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:19,560
colorful the text is blurry the text is blurry on an HDTV you cannot make out

314
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,200
the number of hit points my character has in the corner yes I've tried

315
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,880
adjusting my TV settings contrast brightness all that stuff I didn't have

316
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,520
to adjust it for any other Xbox game I own and even in adjusting it I can't get

317
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,800
it to look the way it does on my computer it's annoying I couldn't

318
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,040
believe it so I even though I might once in a while play Final Fantasy 11 on my

319
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,160
Xbox 360 and I'm kind of screwed where I can't take it back really I don't I

320
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,700
can't recommend this game because I think people that play Xbox 360 that want

321
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,000
to get into role-playing games are honestly going to want something more like Oblivion.

322
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes, Andrew?

323
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,640
Speaking of which, how many massive RPGs does the Xbox 360 have?

324
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,640
I can name one, Oblivion.

325
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
That's it.

326
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
Well, no, no.

327
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
Oblivion is not a massive game.

328
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
I know.

329
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
It's just a massive RPG.

330
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
Okay, sorry.

331
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Huge RPG, not massively multiplayer.

332
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
Just huge RPG.

333
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
Right.

334
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,040
Personally, I don't think the Xbox 360 caters to that type of gamer, at least not yet.

335
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,080
I mean, I've done a little bit of lurking on forums for the 360 version of Final Fantasy

336
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:27,720
And these people who have played the demo are just pissed off that it's not the fast

337
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,160
type of game that they're used to, like say Halo.

338
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:37,600
It's not what the people who would buy a 360 would typically enjoy, so the community might

339
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,840
take a hit on that.

340
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,720
And also the thing that we should all be pissed off about, other than the fact, granted it's

341
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,720
not $60, it's still $50, which is still way too much, the fact that they didn't do anything

342
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,440
with it. The graphics don't look any better, the resolutions aren't any higher, it's just

343
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,360
me. There are, I'll tell you some perks. You can do custom soundtracks with Xbox 360, which

344
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,120
is kind of neat, you know, I'll tell you. You can do custom soundtracks with the PC

345
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,400
too, remember? That doesn't involve hacking. It's not as seamless, it's not as seamless,

346
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,600
it's not as easy. Yes, you can do custom soundtracks, it's not as seamless, you know, it's any idiot

347
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,360
can press the guide button and get custom soundtracks from CDs they've ripped or their

348
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,440
computer if they took a little extra effort.

349
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,320
And you know the fact that you could do live chat in the whole Xbox 360

350
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,240
interface is

351
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,600
kinda neat, although I imagine most PC players are already doing Ventrilo

352
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,000
anyway, so it doesn't matter,

353
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,040
but you know that's... I think the price is actually right because

354
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,440
considering you get the expansion with the game

355
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,720
and everything, I think the price is fair. I think fifty dollars is a fair price for

356
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,760
the game.

357
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,400
I've been reading stories on the internet where people are pissed off

358
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,400
that there's an extra $12.95 fee to go with the game.

359
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
It's an MMO, dumbass. Seriously.

360
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,400
I couldn't believe it. I don't know if I was reading on Joystiq or Kotaku.

361
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Yeah, it was just some retard that didn't realize.

362
00:22:53,400 --> 00:23:01,400
It says right on the box in the upper left hand corner, required internet connection, monthly fee.

363
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
It says right on the box in small print.

364
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Come on, dumbass. You're playing an MMO. Name me.

365
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,320
Come on, like you're telling me that Grand Theft Auto doesn't have, you know, that has

366
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
violence in it?

367
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,240
I didn't know that, it wasn't like it was on the box or anything.

368
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,520
You get these kind of idiots all the damn time is the problem.

369
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,640
Name me, name me three popular MMOs that don't charge a monthly fee.

370
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,160
Anarchy Online, Guild Wars, oooh, I said name three, gotcha.

371
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,820
I don't think Second Life counts.

372
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,640
I don't know, and I'm saying popular, okay?

373
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,640
But you know, it is very popular, but you buy merchandise there.

374
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,200
I am actually more thinking Anarchy Online, I don't think is as popular as some of those

375
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
others.

376
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Yeah, Anarchy Online shows.

377
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,400
So, you know, just kind of saying there, there's not a lot of games that don't have a monthly

378
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
fee, MMOs.

379
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,880
You look at any of the big ones, World of Warcraft, I can name the third one, RuneScape.

380
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,200
It sucks, but it's popular.

381
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,120
Or Ragnarok on pirated servers, which is what most people are doing.

382
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:07,860
I guess I forgot to mention. Oh god, now the chat room is just flooding there.

383
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,120
Guild Wars. Yeah, I already said Guild Wars. Maplestory. Oh, I forgot about Maplestory.

384
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,680
Alright, so maybe there's a few. But come on, the popular ones,

385
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,560
World of Warcraft, Lineage, EverQuest,

386
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,840
Final Fantasy, they all have monthly fees. Guild Wars is probably the most popular

387
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,120
one that doesn't have a monthly fee.

388
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,140
And Guild Wars is a good game. I like Guild Wars. But anyway, I just, I can't believe that some guy

389
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,120
I was stupid did not think there was gonna be this extra monthly fee even

390
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:38,220
Fantasy star online on the Xbox had a monthly fee and it's a bitch to cancel might I add

391
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,380
They will not just stop billing you and you stop playing. It's it's pretty annoying

392
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,140
Anyway, so I'm sorry

393
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,620
I think the only way folks are gonna like this game on 360 is if they know what they're in for and there's probably Final

394
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:58,780
Fantasy 11 fans all ready to write me an angry email. Okay. Well, look I play Final Fantasy a lot, too

395
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:08,780
I knew what I was kind of in for on the Xbox, but I'm trying to look at this as a game that people who have an Xbox 360 and maybe have never played an MMO before,

396
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,780
because Microsoft fans really probably haven't played an MMO before.

397
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:18,780
If you're exclusively an Xbox or Xbox 360 owner, you probably haven't played an MMO before, unless you've played Phantasy Star.

398
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,780
But you certainly haven't played anything about Final Fantasy XI.

399
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,780
This is not the most user-friendly introduction of these games.

400
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,780
It's probably going to turn a lot of people off to it in the future.

401
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:32,780
Did you know that the day the game came out, they had a major problem as well, where the content IDs weren't working?

402
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,780
So you couldn't even play until like 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time in the evening, which is like midnight East Coast time.

403
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,780
So that first of your 30 free days was a wash for most people.

404
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:51,780
Well, I can't exactly say that Final Fantasy XI is exactly newbie friendly. It is a very hardcore MMO to start out with.

405
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,260
Alright, I like this.

406
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:02,820
Chatroom comments here, BlackWolf again says, Dear Sky, your review made me a sad panda.

407
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,220
Love Sephiroth 420 rules.

408
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,980
If you think MMOs with people named Sephiroth are bad, log into Final Fantasy some time.

409
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:21,020
You'll see Sephiroth and Sephiroth, you'll see Tidus and what's, Yuna.

410
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,020
una, unia, unis, unilesca, uni...

411
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,020
Change one letter from a popular character and you got it.

412
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,700
Everything, everything. Alright so

413
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,580
sorry guys I think the only way I would recommend Final Fantasy 11 on Xbox 360 to you

414
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,960
is if you've played it on another system and you already know what you're in for

415
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,820
because you better be patient. You better make sure you have a USB keyboard.

416
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,460
And if you don't believe me a timed video will be coming to OLRPSP.com very

417
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:48,860
soon.

418
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,980
You should see the installation time, let alone...

419
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,420
It was an hour to install and then that doesn't even count the patching.

420
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,420
I remember the beta and then trying to find how to take the beta off the

421
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,980
hard drive. That was great. You know what though? On PC it didn't bother me because I

422
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,140
expect that type of thing from PC games.

423
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,260
That's why I think Final Fantasy 11 is a great game on PC and I think it's

424
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,940
passable on PlayStation 2

425
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,140
because PlayStation 2 doesn't have any nice Xbox Live type service

426
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,860
so I think people you know had to expect something like that. But Xbox 360

427
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,860
People are going to be in for a shock.

428
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,860
Okay, I'm done.

429
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,860
I don't want to talk about Final Fantasy XI anymore.

430
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,860
Andrew, what have you been playing?

431
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,860
How was your gaming week?

432
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,860
Oh, how was my gaming year?

433
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,860
No.

434
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,860
No, just this week.

435
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,940
All right, all right.

436
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,020
I've been getting into guitar here a little bit more.

437
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,700
I've got two more songs to go on Expert.

438
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,300
Just can't pass Bark of the Moon or Cowboys from Hell, but it's been a lot of progress.

439
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,940
I've been playing World of Warcraft, happily almost 57 Rogue on Maelstrom, doing a couple

440
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:52,020
Blackrock Depths runs, 2 of 8 on Shadowcraft, trying to get myself into high-end raiding

441
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,660
guild once I hit 60.

442
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,460
Been playing some res, trying to get into that, can't pass level 5, but the game is

443
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,380
just uber trippy, I'm ashamed of myself that I didn't get into it the first time it came

444
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,220
around.

445
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,300
Actually there's not much else that I can really say about how was my week, but World

446
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,900
World of Warcraft is awesome and is getting better all the time.

447
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,520
Just waiting bated breath for the expansion.

448
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,480
There's still a little bit of controversy about what the new Alliance race is going

449
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,460
to be for the expansion.

450
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,700
There's all sorts of camps going around.

451
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,620
Some people say Ogres, some people say Dranae.

452
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:36,820
I'm personally hoping for Dranae because they have more of a vendetta against the raid

453
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,340
boss of the expansion.

454
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,220
I still want the panda people.

455
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,220
Pandarins?

456
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,220
Yeah.

457
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,540
Pandarins probably won't make it.

458
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,060
I know, but I still want it.

459
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,060
Oh yeah.

460
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,060
Isn't it nice to want?

461
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,700
Hopefully they'll announce some NPCs, Pandarins, over in Outland.

462
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,700
You think we'll find out at E3?

463
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,040
You think Blizzard's just sitting on it for E3 now?

464
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,820
I know that they were definitely holding out on it until April Fool's Day so they could

465
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:10,840
unveil the fictional Alliance race as a joke, and they unveiled Wisps with Herma and Death.

466
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,800
But I think definitely they're going to go for an E3.

467
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,760
I'm expecting probably a November release for Burning Crusade.

468
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,860
So E3 is probably when we're going to find out about the new Alliance race.

469
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:25,440
They don't want to keep us waiting forever, I hope.

476
00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:00,900
Anyway, we're going to move on, get into some gaming news this week, and first to start

477
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,940
off we're going to talk about release dates, right Loki?

478
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,940
Of course.

479
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,300
Loki got some more release dates he wants to share with you guys, remember that these

480
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:11,860
are all tentative, but first, if you still don't believe us on these release date things,

481
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,100
like two things got confirmed this week.

482
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,020
First off, Nintendo Power's recent issue, their cover, and what's on the cover of the

483
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,500
latest Nintendo Power?

484
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,780
Castlevania, Portrait of Whatever.

485
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,340
Portrait of Ruin for those people that said Orange Lounge Radio is pulling that name out

486
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
of their ass.

487
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,860
Nope, there it is, confirmed by Nintendo Power.

488
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,860
Portrait of Ruin.

489
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,860
And then what was the other thing?

490
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,820
There was the Tony Hawk game you mentioned like a month ago?

491
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,460
Tony Hawk Downhill Jam, it was part of the Destination PlayStation news I did on those

492
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,780
mini podcasts that we had, and apparently no one paid attention to any of that stuff

493
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:47,900
because they just released all that same info as new this week, including-

494
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,500
Or a no-name site, remember.

495
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:57,200
including was it the PSP 50 cent game, the Aragon game, let me see what was on my list

496
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:07,240
here. The Marvel Ultimate Alliance which I think at the time I was calling it Marvel

497
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:17,360
Legends, that was the working name. And what else was there? Oh, the gun for PSP. What

498
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,240
else do we have here? I don't know. I think that was pretty much all the major stuff that

499
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,320
they were talking about. Oh, Miami Vice, they were talking about that coming out. Well,

500
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,680
let me reaffirm a few more things since I said them before and now people are starting

501
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,880
to listen a little bit. Here's a few more that they still have not mentioned. Okay,

502
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:40,120
so, granted we have Tony Hawk. These are all new this week or? Well, this is stuff I said

503
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,360
before. Okay. Okay, so before we said Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam for the revolution, okay,

504
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,660
Okay well that's still coming, Marvel Ultimate Alliance is coming on the revolution probably

505
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,540
at launch so that should be good.

506
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:58,960
We're also having on the PSP Pimp My Ride the Game, remember I said this before, Pimp

507
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:06,100
My Ride the Game coming to the Xbox 360 and PSP among other joy and rapture.

508
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:11,220
So remember that, Pimp My Ride the Game coming, Call of Duty is going to be coming to the

509
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:18,160
PSP at some point as well and of course, you know call duty 3 on the ps3 and Xbox 360

510
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,640
You know, that's not a big surprise there. But I tell us the new ones already

511
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:26,280
I want to hear the new ones that you posted this week on the site. No one noticed. Okay. Well anyways

512
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
The ones I posted I'd

513
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Start off with I toy play 3

514
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,980
Which is coming out. Okay, get to the good stuff

515
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:41,020
Okay, SOCOM Combined Assault, this was also announced on other sites too.

516
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,540
They're talking about this game coming out and that's actually supposed to be coming

517
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,900
out on November 15th.

518
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:52,460
Gangs of London, which is the getaway series spinoff, that's coming also on November 15th.

519
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,620
SOCOM Fireteam Bravo 2, also on the 15th on the PSP.

520
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:03,160
The next Ratchet and Clank game coming to the PSP, that's actually in 2007 on Valentine's

521
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:11,160
And the day after that, God of War 2 will be coming out on February 15th, which is awesome.

522
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:18,160
And there are some sports games as well, NBA 07 coming out in October on PS2.

523
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,160
Rogue Galaxy on October 4th.

524
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:29,160
And then if you're an ATV fan, ATV Offroad Fury 4 coming out on Playstation 2 September 27th.

525
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:37,800
and ATV Offroad Fury Pro on the PSP on October 18th, which is going to be pretty cool.

526
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:46,000
Then, from Square Enix, we have Valkyrie Profile Lenith coming out on July 19th.

527
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Not that far away.

528
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,560
The week before that though, Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Service coming out in the United

529
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,160
States on July 12th.

530
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,160
And Final Fantasy XII for the United States, September 12th.

531
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,100
September 12th is the lucky day, right?

532
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,100
September 12th.

533
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,940
Now, but of course, release dates always subject to change, especially with Squeenix.

534
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:16,940
Yeah, so this is what is currently, stuff could move around, but this is going to be

535
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,700
the information everyone has right now until we hear otherwise.

536
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:25,300
Well good job, Loki, keep your ears out there for any other release dates coming up to E3.

537
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,460
Was it, I think in September, Lego Star Wars 2, the original trilogy is coming out.

538
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,740
That was the other one I thought was kind of cool.

539
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,300
But I'm just saying, you know, we had a lot of this stuff from Destination PlayStation.

540
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,460
See no one was reporting on it because no one went to Destination PlayStation.

541
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,660
It's only a retail only event.

542
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,020
Well keep your ears out there in the retail scene so we can, you know, before people catch

543
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,020
on that, you know, that's where we're getting our news.

544
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,780
Anyway, letís get into some other news tonight, talk about games that are officially announced

545
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,520
by the company, even though we all knew it was coming.

546
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,380
Guitar Hero 2 was officially announced, itís going to be coming out.

547
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,540
Guitar Hero 2 was announced earlier, I guess a press conference or something like that

548
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,460
by Red Octane, and of course thereís even a little interview that you can look at over

549
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,280
on IGN, they have a whole little thing going on there, and theyíre going to be able to

550
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,600
do the lead guitar, rhythm guitar, and bass guitar, and so they have it separated into

551
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,800
all those different tracks as well, and there's going to be, I guess, the multiplayer as well

552
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,480
where you can kind of do the separate things going on.

553
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,720
I'm just going to really quickly derail this train.

554
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,280
Before anyone starts calling this innovative, let me remind you Guitar Freaks has been doing

555
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,300
this for years with the whole bass track, in a way, in a way.

556
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,820
55 songs are supposed to be in the game, they're saying also more difficult songs for folks

557
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,120
that have mastered the original, and of course the multiplayer co-op, which I also hinted

558
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,420
at before, that will be coming as well.

559
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,080
No song hints, but we're imagining there's going to be a demo at E3 that ought to give

560
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,680
some of that away.

561
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,740
That and they're also saying that now that they're able, that it's had such a success

562
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,340
with the original, they're able to get bigger name bands now.

563
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:14,120
Before they were like, huh, so maybe a multi-platform at some point would be nice, but don't hold

564
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,340
your breath because that means I have to do new controllers, but we'll see. Of course

565
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,220
it will work with the old controller, they're not going to screw you into getting a new

566
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:26,720
controller, which is good news I'm sure. So, we shall see. I'm hoping for some Guar myself,

567
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,900
I would love to see that in Guitar Hero, complete with the costumed people, like, you know,

568
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:37,660
crowd surfing and all that would be hot. Loki, another confirmation of something I believe

569
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,840
we rumored last week, correct? Yeah, Sony's actually lowered the price of the PS2 down

570
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,240
to $129.99 retail.

571
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,580
And that's not really much of a surprise.

572
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,580
And it's effective as of last week, basically.

573
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,100
And hopefully there's going to be more price cuts coming later.

574
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,180
Maybe one for the 360, that was one other rumor that came out this week.

575
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,460
But definitely worth checking out.

576
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,040
Also, since the day did drop the price of that, you might be able to find the used one

577
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:16,120
for even cheaper than that. Maybe $99. So, if you still haven't gotten a PlayStation

578
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:21,680
2 or want another one, I'd probably recommend doing that. Since it seems like they're going

579
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:28,160
to be supporting PlayStation 2 for a while. Awesome. So, no $99 yet, though, huh? Give

580
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,240
it time. You've got probably Christmas around PS3 launch. About the time. You know what's

581
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,580
interesting, though? $129 is also the cost of a DS, because I lost that bet with Extifer.

582
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,180
was six months since we'd made a bet, and I had to buy his DS today, and that's how

583
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,860
much I paid for it, $129.

584
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,300
So, DS will cost you just as much as a Playstation.

585
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,500
That is until the next DS price drop, which I'm sure is maybe around the time the light

586
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,500
comes out?

587
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
I don't know, probably.

588
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Who knows?

589
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Who knows?

590
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:05,260
Big, big rumor going around this week is from a site, pro-g.co.uk, is Xbox Live Arcade going

591
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:11,980
to get MAME games as well as SEGA games, that could be very interesting.

592
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:17,420
There is a Microsoft source, but of course they can't say who, that says, quote, Xbox

593
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,500
Live Arcade has seen some pretty serious deal-making in this first quarter, it's been a real priority.

594
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,840
The deal-making has been a no-brainer for everyone we've spoken to, and aside from a

595
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,460
few licensing issues with existing products, Xbox Live Arcade is going to smash Nintendo's

596
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,320
virtual console to pieces.

597
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,920
Keep in mind that's coming from a Microsoft source, so it's a little bit biased.

598
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,640
Here the quote goes on, I think this is interesting, you've heard of MAME, right?

599
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,860
We're just doing a legal version of MAME, meaning that all the game owners get paid

600
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,240
and the users get quality product based around a community.

601
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,880
Imagine the biggest arcade in the world just a thousand times bigger.

602
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,280
It'll have as many machines as we can possibly get, all with score rankings and other community

603
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
stuff.

604
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,840
It's not a secret that MAME was massive for hackers of the original Xbox and the pull

605
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,600
and sales of retro game packs on current machines is still really high.

606
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,960
If this is taken and put under the right noses, it should become the biggest thing in mainstream

607
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,040
hardcore gamer crossover in the industry.

608
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,520
They're also saying that Sega is going to jump on board.

609
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,600
Sega games will be included in a major way.

610
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,840
It's a surprising addition to the deal and will include games that Nintendo will also

611
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
be selling.

612
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,240
The Nintendo deal, not exclusive.

613
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,640
Again, take that with a big grain of salt there.

614
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,980
The main thing is a little hard for me to get.

615
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,840
Like I can see maybe using some of the same code, I just couldn't see them calling it

616
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
MAME on the Xbox.

617
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
No, it's not.

618
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,440
Hello, they've already got arcade games on there.

619
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
They're the same thing.

620
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,100
I mean, look, Gauntlet, Smash TV, Robotron.

621
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,100
But those games take a little extra that MAME doesn't.

622
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,620
I mean, because those games have co-op and they have, you know, the Xbox Live achievements

623
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,840
and rankings and things that MAME doesn't exactly have programmed into it.

624
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,740
I think it'd be stupid for them to put like thousands of games on there.

625
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:05,140
I mean I just I don't because I think that's what Nintendo plans to do slowly, but surely. I don't know I

626
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,380
Mame doesn't seem very like a good way to do it. I

627
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:16,060
Just I think the idea is there like they're gonna be bringing more arcade games

628
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,940
Maybe I don't think they're gonna call I don't think it's called Mame and I'm not gonna set up under name

629
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:23,580
I don't know, but that's you know again this be I

630
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,540
I know what it's like and you know what it's like to be on the other side when

631
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,920
you're the site reporting the rumor and have everybody going, oh you guys are

632
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,180
live.

633
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,920
So I don't, you know, I don't know. I think the Sega thing is true. I don't see

634
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,400
why that wouldn't be true.

635
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,760
It makes complete sense to me. Eh, whatever. As long as they put good games on there

636
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,920
where, you know,

637
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,080
where's all my gals' kind of games? That's what we need on Xbox Live Arcade.

638
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,960
Problem for Microsoft though, people are still going to use MAME.

639
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,080
people are still going to hack their Xboxes and put MAME on there

640
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,840
people are still going to use MAME on their PCs most people are still going to do that

641
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,920
most people probably have a 360 probably own a PC

642
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,440
and they'll be like wow MAME on my 360 now I think I'll just play it for free

643
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,240
wait a minute though wait a minute because Gauntlet is still a great selling game

644
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,040
because many of those people are also achievement point whores

645
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,060
so they will buy the game to get 200 achievement points or however many they

646
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,920
can squeeze out of it

647
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,560
huh? yeah by the way

648
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,000
getting achievement points out of Xbox Live arcade games

649
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,200
it's retarded because it's freaking hard comments from our chatroom orange launch

650
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,440
radio click on chat point ratio sucks

651
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,160
Phoenix Rising says I want Neo Geo on live and also says blaster master for

652
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,640
live

653
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,440
that's a good one. Fireboma says the Simpsons arcade game is a classic

654
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,980
that's something that definitely should be on

655
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,580
Xbox Live that would be awesome. Well they're talking about the Ninja Turtles game

656
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,840
Maybe. Ooh, that'd be cool. We shall see.

657
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:59,480
Alright, uh, moving on, going to the next topic. Loki!

658
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,120
Anyways, um, I can't believe Mame

659
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,880
frickin' retarded. Anyways,

660
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,800
um, so yes, there's this whole thing

661
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,600
that was actually out in one of my nice retail industry magazines talking about

662
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,000
this

663
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,320
brand-new Microsoft portable system that is in the works right now.

664
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,840
Codename the X-Player. It's expected to

665
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,760
arrive in 2007, possibly something they announce at E3.

666
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,880
Anyways, the X-Player is in development in Redmond, Washington according to

667
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,280
Dean Takahashi, author of the upcoming

668
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,840
Spiderworks Press book, The Xbox 360 Uncloaked.

669
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:50,320
Takahashi previously wrote Inside the Xbox for Prima, basically it has good sources inside

670
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,320
Microsoft.

671
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:59,160
Basically they're kind of confirming the original rumor saying that Jay Allard and his team

672
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:06,160
behind Xbox Live is working on a system that will actually play games, movies, and music

673
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:12,800
basically kind of like a PSP killer. And you know, I guess we'll probably be hearing more

674
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,080
about this. They're talking about maybe working, that Microsoft's also working on their own

675
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:26,960
digital distribution service, code named Alexandria, which will link the ex-player with this kind

676
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:33,800
of iTunes-like store. I don't know. Interesting. But it says that Microsoft recently signed

677
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:42,960
to deal with Epic Records, which is to bring their music exclusively to Xbox Live, actually

678
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,960
their music videos.

679
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,040
I think we've been seeing that actually with the stuff that they've had on Live right now.

680
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:54,880
So it should be interesting, but this is coming straight out of, well, not a magazine most

681
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,080
people would be reading, but let's see here.

682
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:06,480
media retailing for all those wonderful video retailers out there sorry I have

683
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,720
my mic on it as I say interesting is that just another fancy name for the

684
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,640
origami because that's what our cat room seems to think no it's not the origami

685
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,000
something completely different hasn't come out yet 2007 for this and this is

686
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,800
something that I've heard earlier was being worked on so if you're looking for

687
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,320
a bomb to be dropped at e3 here it is interesting you know I find it

688
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:34,040
interesting that in every article like that it says it's going to be a PSP

689
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,640
killer they're gonna compete directly with Sony you notice they're not

690
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,000
Microsoft haven't tried to compete directly with Nintendo whether they

691
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,280
think Nintendo is just beneath them or just not on the league they always try

692
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,880
to go for the brute force approach and we'll try to help out power the other

693
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,000
systems because Microsoft's trying to create Trojan horse entertainment system

694
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,880
that's basically gonna get into your house you buy the 360 because you want

695
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,200
games on it, but oh look now it also records TV, oh look now I can download videos from

696
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,440
the internet, oh look now I can download movies from the internet, and oh look now it's the

697
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,240
center of my entertainment in my household.

698
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,760
Basically kind of what Sony's doing also except being less shady, well I don't know less shady

699
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,220
about it, but you know slightly less shady about it.

700
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,380
That's what they kind of want to do with the PSP because well the PSP UMD movies sucked

701
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:26,320
and that didn't really take off, but this whole you know e-distribution thing that they're

702
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,460
playing on doing with the PSP, well sure Microsoft wants to get a piece of that action, I mean

703
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,460
why not?

704
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,820
They think that they can defeat Sony in the console world, why not try to defeat them

705
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:41,380
in the handheld market, and to be honest they don't really see the Nintendo DS as a threat

706
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:45,620
because it's not playing movies or music or anything like that, so it's just a gaming

707
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,620
system.

708
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:51,020
Well you've got two companies who market their products as able to do everything, and they

709
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,180
have one apparently backwards little company that just wants to play games.

710
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,580
Well I'm glad it can do everything. To be honest though, it doesn't do everything very well.

711
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,420
It plays music. The internet browser is kinda eh.

712
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:08,700
And to be honest, it doesn't really support... Unless you're browsing olrpsp.com, which it looks

713
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,660
awesome on. It's a great website.

714
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:16,340
But anyways, it's just... it's not very easy to browse with, let me put it that way.

715
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:21,020
You can use it. It's great if you're... Not enough people design just for the PSP.

716
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,100
I think there's a lot

717
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,020
to be milked out at the PSP. And I think you're going to see some pretty innovative things

718
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,620
coming soon. Wink wink nudge nudge.

719
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:34,380
Oh yeah. Anyway, and then yeah, we have comments from our chat room. Jaded2006

720
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:34,780
says,

721
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,060
OLR PSP looks awesome on Firefox. Well look,

722
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:43,980
we don't design it for Firefox. Speaking of which, OLR PSP does have a brand new video

723
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,100
that I've uploaded.

724
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,420
Straight from the bachelor party is me playing

725
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,540
Mario Kart GP and to be honest, what you see on the video

726
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:56,100
is all I remember of it because I don't remember actually playing the game

727
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,180
I've just watched the videos. Gizm just asked about that in chat. That video is

728
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,620
up. It just went up before the show started tonight, the Mario Kart video, so

729
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,300
check that out.

730
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,340
Did you lose a sock? Comment from our chat room.

731
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:10,680
You can't have the origami in the X-player. Microsoft is backing the

732
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,020
origami or the UMPC so much. Why would they back both?

733
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:17,540
Because that one's a PC. This is an actual

734
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,540
video game console interesting

735
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,180
other comments in the chat room you will bow to me says fifty dollars says the

736
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,420
ex-playa will be the size of a fuckin brick

737
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,120
and a spirit snare says sixty dollars the ex-playa will be big

738
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,220
play on the word big there like big as in

739
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,020
you know yeah here's my other question is what will g4 think of this

740
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:42,700
who cares because it has explained well fire bomb it thinks it'll be the great

741
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,300
repetitive jokes and sarcasm for Morgan Webb and Adam Sessler trying to piss you

742
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,160
off more and more

743
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,840
until you get better just as you can stop playing. But you know what? We're complete.

744
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,040
You know what? I forgot who's gonna dominate the market.

745
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:58,600
The brand new, um... Phantom? No, not the Phantom.

746
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,360
The Phantom's gone. N-Gage 2.0? Yes, the brand new N-Gage.

747
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,200
And their big, their booth that's in the middle, the front of the door,

748
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,800
doorway there when you walk into E3. When you walk into E3 this year, if you're walking into, what,

749
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,160
South Hall? Is that South Hall?

750
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,280
Yeah. The bigger one? Right when you walk into South Hall, guess what the first booth is you're gonna see?

you go that's just bad dialogue i'm a bad enough dude i'm surprised that dialogue wasn't

779
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:37,500
in the silent hill movie oh there was a hole here all right Jill sandwich some

780
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,380
people in the chat room are saying was a better quote from Resident Evil you know

781
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:44,820
don't don't want to see you in a in a Jill sandwich all right I'm sure you

782
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,820
guys have plenty of additions to that list right IGN tell them you're pissed

783
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:56,780
um next story Loki yes there's a big e3 email that went out and one things on

784
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,500
there was something mentioning the Revolution.

785
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,160
And what was it, you may ask, well it's going to be a flight game put out by Hudson Soft

786
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:09,500
and of course we can only speculate what that's going to be like, but it should be fun at

787
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,500
least.

788
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:16,060
Of course more Revolution stuff going to be shown at E3, playable demos of Red Steel and

789
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:20,560
that type of thing, but always looking for more innovative stuff, maybe this is the next

790
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,920
pilot wings, now to be honest I don't remember, Hudson's off putting out pilot wings, so doubt

791
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:32,680
that. Didn't Hudson have something to do though with Smash Brothers Melee? Maybe, I want to

792
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:37,200
say. That was Hal Labs, not Hudson. Well anyways, basically they said, you know, you're going

793
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,880
to be taking those guys away that you've never experienced before on any home console using

794
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,160
the Revolutions gesture system, which I don't remember what the gesture system is, but I

795
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:52,780
I imagine it has something to do with the controller, built into their innovative controller.

796
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:57,620
Hudson's new flight game allows total plane control as players pilot their planes through

797
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:04,620
various acrobatic flight maneuvers ranging from sky artistry to bomb drops.

798
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:13,220
They should have like a paper airplane controller attachment or something. Something innovative

799
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:20,780
There is the part of the show where we would have done the mailbag, however DarkStalker

800
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,580
is not here.

801
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:31,240
But if you want to send us an email, just send us something over at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

802
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:36,420
We also have a MySpace, and once in a while we'll get a couple emails in there on the

803
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,420
MySpace.

804
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:42,160
Our MySpace is located at www.myspace.com.

805
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,240
By the way, love in the comments you guys are leaving for us.

806
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,360
We have some pretty funny listeners.

807
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,840
We leave comments on people's journals and we have about four pictures that we cycle

808
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,840
through.

809
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,680
We're trying to add a couple more to be original, but some people have actually been parodying

810
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,920
those pictures and then reposting them back on our MySpace, which has been pretty funny,

811
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,080
so we appreciate that sense of humor.

812
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,320
I'm going to read a message I got here, and I'm not sure the guy's real name, it's Classy

813
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,300
Plastic Lumber, Plastic Lumber is his display name right now.

814
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,300
You guys rock!

815
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,580
But yeah, I've been listening to your show since the PSP got the RSS feature, and I'm

816
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,060
just now trying to listen in live.

817
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:20,820
I have the Java chat working well, and I'm still working on the live stream, so hopefully

818
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:24,440
I'll listen in on Sunday, and you should see me in to chat.

819
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,060
And he gives his nickname there, and let me see, did he make it in to chat?

820
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:30,320
He did not make it in to chat, so unfortunately he failed.

821
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,620
So here's a little help on how to listen to our show live, for those of you guys that

822
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,940
want to do so.

823
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:39,300
Head on over to www.orangehonortrader.com, and there's actually a little picture with

824
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:45,580
the Live 365 logo and if you click on that on Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard

825
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:48,040
Time that's how you can tune into us live.

826
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:54,200
Keep in mind we actually go live at 5.30 and we can only have 50 slots for people to listen

827
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,200
live.

828
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,480
We only have 50 slots and that's been filling up lately so we're looking at alternatives

829
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,040
on how we can get more slots without having to pay an assload so that's going to be coming

830
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,880
soon hopefully but for right now you want to get in there 5.30 if you're a

831
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,900
diehard 5.30 is really the best time to get in there because that's when we go

832
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,640
live and Dark Sakura prepares a 30-minute pre-show playlist some type of

833
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,000
theme there for you guys to enjoy tonight it was bootylicious music it

834
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,600
was pretty good there was some like old-school 90s rap in there so you can

835
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,720
listen to that and then we're live and we were here from 6 o'clock till about

836
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,640
8 o'clock 830 whenever we finish and then we do a bonus live show called the

837
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,420
after birth which is just it's insanity we don't even really talk about games we

838
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:40,780
just talk about it's dick and fart jokes and other fun stuff whatever we feel

839
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:45,520
like so tune in for that it's a good time all right so again if you want to

840
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,780
send us an actual email it's mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and maybe we'll

841
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:52,620
read some of those on whatever we do next week because I think we're gonna do

842
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,380
like a mini show or something even though we won't be here live and then

843
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,740
definitely we'll get all caught up on that when we come back I want to say May

844
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:08,740
May 1st is that show? No, I guess it's going to be the one right before E3, May 7th is when we'll be back, it'll be our big E3 preview show, so look forward to that.

845
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:16,740
Moving on, let's go back over to Loki, who is going to tell us about a very popular series getting a sequel.

846
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:20,740
Yes, Command & Conquer 3, it's Hiberian Wars.

847
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,740
It's been officially announced by EA.

848
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:27,740
And basically, you know, kind of picking up where the last game left off.

849
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:33,740
It takes place in 2047, and will feature the latest in RTS technology.

850
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:36,740
Also featuring the GDI, the Brotherhood of Nod.

851
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:41,740
Just looks pretty cool, and I'm a huge Command & Conquer fan.

852
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,740
I really hope they bring it over to the 360.

853
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:49,740
Especially Red Alert. I love Red Alert.

854
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:53,740
Anyways, so that should be coming soon. Hopefully we'll see that at E3.

855
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:57,740
Hope I get to check it out.

856
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:01,740
It looks pretty cool.

857
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:05,740
Alright. Oh, it's coming out in 2007 for Windows PC.

858
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:09,740
Look for that Command & Conquer fan. That's a series I just couldn't get into.

859
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:13,740
I understand why people love it. It's just a certain genre of game I don't really play.

860
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,340
You know what though, I loved it for a different reason other than the fact that I loved it

861
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,700
because you can customize it because you can actually mod it using this thing called the

862
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:25,040
rules.ini file and I can make my own custom troops that were really powerful and stuff

863
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,420
and just completely cheat in the game.

864
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:31,400
But it made it fun because you could do that, you could send that file to somebody else,

865
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,700
play online, and play with those customized troops.

866
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,580
I thought that was really cool, the whole customization part of it, but eh.

867
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:45,140
Here's another game people are looking forward to, another highly anticipated sequel, Ridge

868
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,140
Racer 7.

869
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:49,380
It actually seems a little early for this to me because Ridge Racer 6 hasn't been out

870
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:53,620
very long, but Namco Bandai did announce Ridge Racer 7.

871
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,300
Here's the kind of catch.

872
00:56:55,300 --> 00:57:01,660
It's going to be developed as a banner title for the PlayStation 3.

873
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:05,640
This was from Famitsu Magazine, so they have some very sexy screenshots there of Ridge

874
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,860
Racer 7.

875
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:11,880
Now the question is going to be what's going to look better Ridge Racer 6 or Ridge Racer

876
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,880
7?

877
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,880
Because you know...

878
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,880
7 looks a lot better.

879
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,500
I've seen some screenshots of just one of the cars that they showed.

880
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,420
I couldn't tell that that wasn't a real car.

881
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:24,900
I mean it looked Project Gotham Racing 3-ish.

882
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,540
You know I mean just that much better.

883
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:33,180
And that's pretty bad if that's a first gen game and they're already doing what Project

884
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,180
Gotham did.

885
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,180
Easy.

886
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:40,940
I don't know, we'll see. I think it's going to be awesome and I'm looking forward to it.

887
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:47,460
I didn't see... I loved Ridge Racer 6. Granted they haven't changed anything since Ridge

888
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:54,460
Racer 4, or even maybe before that, but so what? You know, it's still the same game,

889
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,500
it's good, it's fun. Burnout, they haven't changed anything in Burnout except for the

890
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:04,620
cars that have bad AI. Not my favorite racer on the 360, but a solid one. And a long, you

891
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:09,100
respected series. It sort of makes sense that Namco is going full circle with Ridge Racer 7

892
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,740
being a launch title for the PS3. If you think about it, on the PS1, Ridge Racer is a launch

893
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,580
title there, so maybe they're just trying to reconnect to the Sony crowd. Ridge Racer is a

894
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:23,100
launch title for the PSP as well. All good points. Ridge Racer 7, if you don't agree with our

895
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,540
opinions, you want to judge for yourself, you're going to get your shot E3 in a couple weeks,

896
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:30,700
even if you aren't going, you know the media will get to the internet somehow. Now, we don't know

897
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,060
if it's going to be a playable title, because we really don't know the status of PlayStation 3

898
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:37,660
still for sure uh... but there will definitely at least be a trailer and

899
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:40,780
they're saying it's called Ridge Racer Vision 2010

900
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,420
so check that out that'll be just a couple weeks

901
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:47,460
we're like what two weeks away? By the way if you do own Ridge Racer 6 for the

902
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,840
360

903
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,940
I swear to god you gotta constantly watch that marketplace

904
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:56,320
there was more cars to download they they literally have over like sixty

905
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,740
downloads for Ridge Racer 6

906
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,220
and most of them are free

907
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:04,480
all the cars are free i've downloaded like threesome cars for the saying

908
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,640
i mean it's excellent you really need to check it out if you haven't yet

909
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,740
and by god by now it should be used for pretty cheap i mean it was one large

910
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,440
cells that no one like

911
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,100
it's definitely one of the many guessing no one liked it

912
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:20,600
okay it was at the very bottom of the list as far as popularity go i thought

913
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:25,420
uh... i thought and three was the least i don't know and three i think that even

914
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:29,300
it was number one in japan well number one launch out of japan but interesting

915
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,900
In the United States, it just bombed, which I don't understand, it didn't look bad.

916
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:38,580
It wasn't like, you know, I thought it was a pretty good game, but it's fine.

917
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,620
It's a solid game, let's put it that way.

918
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:44,380
Alright, speaking about E3 coming up in a couple weeks, Loki, news is starting to get

919
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,220
out, who's showing what, huge emails went out to the attendees this week, right?

920
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:53,260
Yes, of course, and they have the big, you know, kind of like showing, basically advertising

921
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:57,620
some of the new properties that we're going to see there this year.

922
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:01,460
Some basic ones I've got to mention, Elvion, which is one of the 360 games that looked

923
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:05,740
really sweet using the Unreal 3 engine, which is interesting.

924
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:11,900
Desperate Housewives the game, which we mentioned on a different show, which I don't know how

925
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,140
that's going to translate into a game.

926
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:20,300
One that I thought was kind of funny, Diet Queen, where you had to try dieting, one of

927
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,020
those educational games I guess.

928
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,020
Okay.

929
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,020
Or diet trying.

930
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,740
This one's interesting though.

931
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:30,700
They're actually creating video game tycoon where you get to be a video game design company

932
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,580
so that one's kind of neat.

933
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,580
That's cute.

934
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:34,580
Some other things, Bomberman X0.

935
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:35,580
Oh wait.

936
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:36,580
We talked about that before.

937
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:37,580
OG!

938
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,580
Where did I hear that one already?

939
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,580
Rengoku 2.

940
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:40,580
Yeah we talked about that too.

941
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:41,580
Funny.

942
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,400
Silent Hill fans will be interested to know that there's going to be a mobile version

943
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,700
coming to cell phones.

944
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,860
Same with Hellboy.

945
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:50,700
No they won't because cell phone games suck.

946
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:54,260
Well tell that to the people that own the N-Gage.

947
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,260
Okay.

948
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,260
Cell phone games suck get a real system

949
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:06,260
Super Pac-Man as being released by Namco which you know, no surprise there. Of course, um, they're also working on Dragon Spirit

950
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:10,100
Which should be interesting and Snoopy and the Red Baron because it's got me

951
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:16,620
The only decent cell phone game I've ever played is Sudoku and that's because it's so doku

952
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:21,260
It's hard to fuck that this one sound kind of interesting when I read the little thing on it r2 beat

953
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:25,540
being developed by this company called seed 9 entertainment and it's gonna

954
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:33,100
combine it's an online rhythm action racing game so I guess that's good it's

955
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:40,940
basically this is kind of combining both music beat and extreme speed so it

956
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:46,980
sounds like if I don't know amp was amplitude or whatever was a racing game

957
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:49,100
I don't know, it might be kind of neat.

958
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:54,860
King of Fighters 2006 coming from SNK and a whole bunch of Metal Slug crap, including

959
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:58,860
the Metal Slug collection, which, you know, I thought they were all the same anyways,

960
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:01,580
but yeah.

961
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,580
That's basically it.

962
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,020
Alright, things to look forward to at E3.

963
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:09,180
Expect a full report on the Diet Revolution, what was that called?

964
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:10,180
Diet Girl.

965
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,180
Diet Girl.

966
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,900
Oh, can't wait to play that.

967
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:13,900
Yes.

968
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:17,680
I don't know that can be maybe my subtitle on the show in the future

969
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:22,540
If you'd rather not hear about new stuff

970
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:27,880
But you're still living in the retro gaming phase and you'll be happy to know or if you just you bought

971
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:33,700
Oblivion for the 360 and just loved it and you want to know a little more about this series history head on over to

972
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:38,620
The elder Scrolls calm because you know what the original Elder Scrolls arena game

973
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:45,620
game, free download! Enjoy! It's free! Check it out! We like the word free. So what if

974
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:50,620
the game is years old, you know? Respect the roots, just like Rockstar has Grand Theft

975
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:54,580
Auto 1 and 2 free downloads, and I think there was another game too that they put out. I

976
01:02:54,580 --> 01:03:01,580
also have Star Siege Tribes out for free. You can't beat free. Exactly. Alright, Loki.

977
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:06,380
Now if you don't like your gaming free, but you like to spend a little more money, you

978
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:10,180
You might be able to buy a super special upgrade coming to the 360 soon, right?

979
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:11,180
Or rumor it anyway.

980
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:15,380
Yeah, like a $100 HD DVD drive that'll be external.

981
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:16,380
Cost about $100.

982
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:20,020
Supposed to be shown at E3.

983
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,820
Why?

984
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:29,020
This is interesting to me because didn't HD DVD players just come out for $1,000?

985
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,580
And now they're saying it's only going to be $100?

986
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,460
That was blurry, I thought.

987
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,780
But yeah, I don't understand why they're releasing this.

988
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:40,780
For one, I don't understand why they're releasing it as an external drive, because that would look ugly as hell on a 360.

989
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:47,780
But, I don't think it has the bandwidth through USB to do it, so I don't know how they're planning on pulling across.

990
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:53,780
Unless it's gonna, you know, kinda slap on top maybe where the hard drive goes or something to run it SATA or something.

991
01:03:53,780 --> 01:04:03,780
I don't know. But, also kinda related in the same article, they're talking about 100GB hard drive is supposed to be shown at E3 as well.

992
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:10,900
as well, no price and date available and also the premium pack will be dropped $100 to $299

993
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:18,780
retail in October and the core system will be $80 less, which is the other story.

994
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:24,140
I could see that happening because they got to compete with the PS3 when it comes out,

995
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:30,780
but I don't know about, I don't believe the $100 mark for the system.

996
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,620
A hundred dollars seems really, really low.

997
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:38,660
I would have to see, we'd have to see about that because that's kind of, I don't know.

998
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:42,540
That's going to really screw all those other HD DVD stand-alone players, but then again

999
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:45,420
maybe that's Microsoft once, maybe they're willing to take a hit on it so people get

1000
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:50,020
that gaming system, and as you say, the Trojan horse in their living room, which I've not

1001
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:54,900
really heard you say that before, but I really like that because it's true.

1002
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:59,260
Another Xbox story sure to piss off people that bought their Xbox's launch week.

1003
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:02,900
Yeah, well, this isn't really... they shouldn't be too pissed off about it.

1004
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:07,020
The CPU is getting upgraded. Basically all they're doing is they're

1005
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,380
making the same CPU.

1006
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:11,620
It's a bit smaller so it's going to take less power, less heat.

1007
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:16,740
That's about it. Although, they're really having many issues with the CPU overheating.

1008
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:19,980
That was never the problem. It was the GPU overheating.

1009
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:24,740
Oh, really? I was just going to say, trust me, those Xbox 360's had problems.

1010
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:28,500
If you don't believe me, go back and listen to the show when I bought my Xbox 360 the same week.

1011
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:34,460
Well, all you have to know is it's not going to make your Xbox 360 any faster, so if you

1012
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:40,340
bought it in launch day, whatever, and it's still working, not to worry, and it's not

1013
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:46,140
really expected it's going to cause any compatibility issues, but then again, I've seen them screw

1014
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:49,260
up smaller things, so.

1015
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:57,980
Although hopeful models, hopeful modders might find a way to overclock it with that more

1016
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:03,340
thermally efficient CPU you think they haven't done it yet they might I don't

1017
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:09,060
think so we shall see well one thing hackers love to do is install Linux on

1018
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:13,780
everything now they don't have to because there's a system coming out just

1019
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:18,540
for them this is coming from Linux devices calm a Linux based handheld

1020
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:22,180
gaming platform that runs native and emulated games as shipping in the US

1021
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:29,960
Game Park's GP2X is powered by a pair of ARM processors, has an open source API and development

1022
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:39,800
tools, and can run thousands of classic console video games, online retailer Dynamism.

1023
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:43,400
The GP2X was originally known as the GPX2.

1024
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:52,320
It's got 64 megs of RAM, flash, expandable via an SD card slot, 3.5-inch QVGA LCD monitor

1025
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:59,000
that supports 170,000 colors, 4-way controller and a small thumb joystick on the left, I.O.

1026
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,640
ports include stereo headphone jack, USB 2.0, and TV out.

1027
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:08,820
And of course, people are loading that crap up with emulators, kind of interesting.

1028
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,240
Would anything like this ever make it big?

1029
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,360
No, why not?

1030
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:18,300
this is like total I mean this sounds great it's a total geek thing but hey

1031
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:26,100
it plays thousands of games on it it plays thousands of games it's great but

1032
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:31,140
but where's the challenge of putting Linux on that I mean get this 170 to 200

1033
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:35,900
dollars for this thing is that not cheaper isn't the PSP 199 still I can't

1034
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:41,100
remember what I'm 40 yeah it's about this thing is as much as a PSP and it's

1035
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,100
It's just made for developing.

1036
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,100
I don't know.

1037
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,100
Interesting.

1038
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:49,100
I'm going to try to see if we can get one of these people on the show.

1039
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,100
I want to know more about this.

1040
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:57,100
I know that the GPE 2X or whatever, the original one, they're developing for it right now.

1041
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:00,100
They have a lot of homebrew stuff on there.

1042
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,100
Comments from our chat room.

1043
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,100
As long as you're ready to dot com, click on chat.

1044
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:07,100
Phoenix Rising says, Linux is still too obscure for it to sell.

1045
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:12,380
GK128 says you can put a different Linux distro on. That's the challenge.

1046
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:15,820
True. He's got a point. He does have a point.

1047
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:20,260
Moving on.

1048
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:24,320
Loki, also a challenge. If you're a Duke Nukem fan,

1049
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:28,600
convincing yourself that forever will be out any day now can sometimes be a real

1050
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,980
challenge. I'm gonna laugh

1051
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:33,200
if they have this at E3, to be honest, but no, actually

1052
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,520
basically there's an article that I think even came out last week

1053
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,880
about how

1054
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:45,160
George Broussard is basically sick of Duke Nukem Forever and he's

1055
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:50,080
you know from 3D Realms basically saying you know it's taken so long to actually

1056
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,080
develop the game

1057
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:55,040
just right now you know the problem is when they show it off

1058
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,280
you know people are gonna be like eh whatever but they just want to finish it

1059
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:02,480
they want to get it done get it out there and try to recover some of that

1060
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:06,280
many many dollars spent on developing it. So if this play can work on the sequel that is apparently

1061
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,800
they were talking about working on. I can't believe they're talking about a sequel for

1062
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:14,240
Duke Nukem Forever, I mean... It's called Duke Nukem, no, really. No, really what they

1063
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:18,960
should do is change the name of Duke Nukem Forever. Change it to something else. Yeah,

1064
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:24,600
Duke Nukem Forever isn't coming out, but... It's, uh, Luke... Duke Nukem 3. Luke, Sock

1065
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:30,840
It To Em Forever. I mean, honestly, I think what they should do is they should develop

1066
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:34,640
the game and just release all the partial games that they had, like the one on the Quake

1067
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,280
2 engine, the one on the unreal engine.

1068
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:42,480
Just scrap the name and call it Duke Nukem 4, that's all you gotta do.

1069
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,840
I don't know, we'll see.

1070
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:50,080
Do you want to be the first person in the world to play the Nintendo Revolution?

1071
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,960
I bet you do, you little fanboys and girls.

1072
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,800
Well here's the deal, Nintendo and AOL.com are teaming up and they're going to be having

1073
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,920
a contest.

1074
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:03,060
One lucky Nintendo fan gets to go to Los Angeles, touch and play with the revolution before

1075
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:06,880
the conference and then present the machine to the world a few hours later

1076
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,260
at the Nintendo conference. By the way, you're going to the Nintendo conference, aren't you, Loki?

1077
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:14,840
Maybe. I hate you. I hate you. How did you get in?

1078
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:19,020
I've got connections. Oh, you little bitch. I'm not going. Dark Soccer's not going, but

1079
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,520
Loki is going to the Nintendo conference

1080
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,880
and we'll let you know firsthand what happens. But you are not the... you're not going to be

1081
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:28,380
the second person in the world to play the thing either, right? I'll beat people up, but will people...

1082
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:32,360
Well, they're going to be having the black-eyed peace there to, you know, distract people so I can play

1083
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,200
you the console, so... But I'm gonna definitely get to play before E3.

1084
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:40,160
Here's the funny thing. Three finalists are gonna be chosen by entries that are

1085
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,900
given on AOL's website,

1086
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:45,800
but only one person is going to be selected once they're all out there to

1087
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:46,600
actually do it.

1088
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,760
Wouldn't that suck to be one of the other two? But they all get to go to E3 anyway, huh?

1089
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,140
What cares? They get to go...

1090
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:56,280
It's... So what? I was the first to play in the world. Whatever. I mean, it's no big deal.

1091
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,440
Yeah, get out of my way. I want to play.

1092
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:06,760
Well, I guess I wasn't really the first non-Konami employee to play the supernova in the United

1093
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,520
States, so that was kind of cool.

1094
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,520
Yeah.

1095
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,760
You know, it's just like Final Fantasy XI this week.

1096
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,920
I was the first person to get Corsair!

1097
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:18,640
Well, I was the first person to get laid tonight, so, you know.

1098
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,320
Is there any quests involved with that?

1099
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,040
Yeah, there's big quests and the whole thing.

1100
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,840
So it's like everybody puppet master now?

1101
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,040
Everybody just has to be first!

1102
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,600
Everybody just wants to be first!

1103
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:33,040
It's like I'm looking for a white mage, but all we have is blue mage and corsair and puppet master

1104
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,440
I mean

1105
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,280
I'm sorry. It's just that 360 thing just could have been better

1106
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:48,440
So anyway if you want to enter AOL, I think you have to be on AOL to do it so hope you're there

1107
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:55,440
Anyway, but Rob, how will I ever find a CD to sign up for AOL?

1108
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:00,440
I don't know, maybe go to AOL.com?

1109
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,440
You have any other release dates for us?

1110
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,440
I slotted us some time to talk about release dates,

1111
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,440
but I don't know if you have your list or whatever.

1112
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,440
What's coming up this week?

1113
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,440
The Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories moved dates.

1114
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,440
It moved to June 6th, and then they dropped the price again to $19.99 retail.

1115
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,440
Oh, I'm being corrected by our chatroom.

1116
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,960
it's not AOL only, it is open to non-AOL members as well.

1117
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,000
GK128 said it first, thank you guys.

1118
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,200
I should go sign up for that and see if I can win it.

1119
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,640
I know, maybe I should go sign up too.

1120
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,100
I just don't want to get AOL crap.

1121
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:30,240
Well, then again, I already get it.

1122
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,800
How worse could it be?

1123
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,560
Because I had AOL for two weeks

1124
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,160
because I bought it for a trip.

1125
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:38,600
Just don't, I don't want to, I feel dirty.

1126
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:43,320
You don't leave AOL ever.

1127
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:50,320
No, um, but next week, um, or actually I should say this week, um, great stuff coming out.

1128
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:55,360
Finally, finally, Advent Children is finally coming out.

1129
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,360
Is it finally here?

1130
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,360
Finally.

1131
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,960
They're advertising it on TV so you can go pick it up.

1132
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,880
You might even be able to find it in the stores now if you're listening to the podcast because

1133
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,040
people like Breaking Street Date.

1134
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,880
But definitely go check it out if you haven't seen it yet, although you probably have on

1135
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:15,720
the internet, but now's your chance to get a nice English copy of it. Go check it out

1136
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:21,360
now. Also, coming out this week I have Outrun 2006 Coast to Coast, which is going to be

1137
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:31,360
pretty fun. Also Rampage World Tour, Rampage Total Destruction coming out, which isn't really

1138
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:38,240
any different than the last few Rampage games. And then Win Back 2, Project Poseidon is coming

1139
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:43,720
out. Not too much buzz on that but that's still good. Ace Combat Zero, The Belkan War.

1140
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:50,460
If you're a, you know, flight sim fan you're gonna love that. And I believe that was all

1141
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:55,780
the big stuff. I was really looking for Grand Theft Auto but they had to move it. Hopefully

1142
01:13:55,780 --> 01:14:01,920
they're either working on multiplayer or fixing multiplayer because their multiplayer sucked.

1143
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,420
god damn lazy programmers

1144
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:06,520
snow wondered that is what's going to take

1145
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,100
you know take two down

1146
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:13,240
uh... we're gonna go to a break here pretty soon but first i want to mention the

1147
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,900
chat room you know that whole a l l conversation now they're talking about

1148
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,720
other like old school

1149
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:21,720
networks like uh... compu serve and somebody brought up prodigy i was on

1150
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:25,280
prodigy years ago copy sir prodigy jeannie

1151
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:29,980
jeannie all my god jeannie and then uh... what's the other big one delphi and i

1152
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:32,740
But there's another huge one I'm leaving out that people were saying in the chat

1153
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:33,620
room.

1154
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:36,020
Maybe not CompuServe.

1155
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:39,700
Maybe. If you go all the way back to Commodore 64, there was one that was

1156
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:41,660
before AOL, because AOL bought them out.

1157
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:46,420
Quark, do you want to say what it was called? I used to freaking go on a bulletin board

1158
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:51,260
which had internet access. BBS's were hardcore. I used to do BBS's like in the Sacramento area

1159
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,960
like hardcore. Grab the

1160
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,680
California Computer News, a little free publication that was out there,

1161
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:00,140
have the BBS list in the back and you can, you know, find a bunch of stuff on there.

1162
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:04,940
Remember back in the day, you know, those you guys used to call into BBS is

1163
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:07,840
probably if you're more like our age, like in your twenties, although I imagine there's

1164
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,100
some teens that remember this too.

1165
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:13,380
Like, it wasn't about the size of your internet penis,

1166
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,900
but it was about how much of the sis-ops

1167
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:22,120
ass you kissed to get access points. It was for more time with door games.

1168
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,860
So you could play Legend of the Red Dragon and The Pit

1169
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:30,340
and uh... without trade wars two thousand two and all those games it was

1170
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:32,580
all about downloading registered

1171
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:37,660
uh... shareware programs at twenty four hundred beef burden of fifty six uh...

1172
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:39,940
kbps and also

1173
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:44,220
and basically uh... you know using that wonderful c batch protocol the download

1174
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:48,220
everything in your you know telnet thick fifty six k you're kidding ninety six

1175
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:49,940
hundred baud

1176
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:54,720
yet we were lucky i want i want i want an orange lounge radio bbs

1177
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:58,780
That's what I want. Can we have that? Can we make that happen? Can't you do it through

1178
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:01,260
Telnet now, or something?

1179
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:05,860
I'm gonna talk to our webmaster. I hope he's listening. Why would we run a BBS? Because I wanna...

1180
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:09,360
Because it's a BBS! Because it's a BBS, dude!

1181
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,080
You can play Legend of the Red Dragon in the pit.

1182
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:17,360
We have the technology. Yes, we have the technology. We can build it.

1183
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:21,360
My mother would never let me get a second phone line to run a BBS when I was a kid.

1184
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:25,760
I want one now do something on the website that look like a bbs. No, I want a bbs

1185
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,600
I want message boards and everything. Let's just make a mud and call that a day

1186
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:37,600
Fuck a mud. I want to bbs. All right. I played muds for like two weeks and then I was like, oh my god

1187
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,840
Two weeks. Oh my god. You're like uber hardcore

1188
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,240
I know I was like it's an I was like after two weeks

1189
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,640
I was like, this is the nerdiest i've ever been in my entire life

1190
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,480
And that's saying quite a bit

1191
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,640
That makes me feel nerdier than usual.

1192
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,920
All right.

1193
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,360
Anyway, we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio

1194
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,920
right after this little break.

1195
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,040
Kid Whatever, one of the artists from In the Groove,

1196
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,520
is going to be with us in part B. So definitely, definitely
