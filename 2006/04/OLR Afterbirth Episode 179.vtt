WEBVTT

00:14.894 --> 00:15.754
and many more.

00:40.652 --> 00:41.993
Thank you for watching!

01:10.097 --> 01:15.881
Thanks for watching!

01:38.949 --> 01:39.710
Thanks for watching!

02:10.206 --> 02:11.687
Thank you for watching!

02:47.640 --> 02:48.441
Thanks for watching!

03:14.652 --> 03:15.915
Thanks for watching!

03:33.581 --> 03:38.262
[SPEAKER_01]: Mention the fact that you nearly fell off the chair.

03:38.482 --> 03:40.002
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how I almost fell into the wall.

03:40.042 --> 03:43.443
[SPEAKER_01]: An extra person here talking about using it as a battery for your vibrator.

03:43.463 --> 03:44.703
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about Wondershowsin.

03:44.743 --> 03:46.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, let's talk about Wondershowsin.

03:46.403 --> 03:48.624
[SPEAKER_04]: I just took over the show.

03:48.744 --> 03:50.704
[SPEAKER_04]: How about that?

03:50.804 --> 03:52.324
[SPEAKER_04]: Wondershowsin is awesome.

03:54.925 --> 03:55.985
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you Wondershowsin?

03:56.565 --> 03:58.325
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're so awesome.

03:58.905 --> 03:59.806
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a hot dog.

04:01.126 --> 04:01.886
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you're cool.

04:04.304 --> 04:08.127
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, not as cool as Wondershoes, which is your fairly hot.

04:08.408 --> 04:12.571
[SPEAKER_06]: I am moderately hot.

04:16.595 --> 04:23.300
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway... Hey everybody, I just took over the show.

04:23.341 --> 04:24.241
[SPEAKER_04]: How's about that?

04:24.261 --> 04:28.385
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody should tell me how cool I am.

04:28.485 --> 04:29.146
[SPEAKER_04]: You start.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.508
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to do this again.

04:33.094 --> 04:35.154
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was great.

04:35.935 --> 04:38.195
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the kid that was dressed up like Hitler.

04:38.355 --> 04:42.536
[SPEAKER_04]: Trevor is the best beat kid on that show.

04:42.556 --> 04:43.796
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for returning, Rob.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.116
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the kid about pills, though.

04:45.136 --> 04:46.557
[SPEAKER_04]: He's my favorite.

04:46.637 --> 04:47.137
[SPEAKER_00]: Pills!

04:47.217 --> 04:47.717
[SPEAKER_00]: Pills!

04:47.817 --> 04:48.317
[SPEAKER_00]: Pills!

04:49.057 --> 04:49.457
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut up.

04:49.717 --> 04:53.738
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the power brick should be bigger than the PSP.

04:53.838 --> 04:57.939
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be like a 360 or an Xbox that you just slap to the back of the PSP.

04:58.407 --> 04:59.888
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be a nuclear generator.

05:00.489 --> 05:03.092
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the power packs in Ghostbusters.

05:04.974 --> 05:06.695
[SPEAKER_06]: Power bricks made out of solid metal.

05:06.795 --> 05:09.858
[SPEAKER_06]: It just gets super hot and you can cook eggs on it.

05:10.719 --> 05:11.360
[SPEAKER_06]: Mmm, eggs.

05:12.161 --> 05:13.262
[SPEAKER_06]: Mmm, eggy.

05:15.506 --> 05:15.946
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

05:16.727 --> 05:17.748
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, is this thing on?

05:17.788 --> 05:18.309
[SPEAKER_05]: Testing.

05:19.490 --> 05:20.351
[SPEAKER_05]: Testing 1-2.

05:20.931 --> 05:24.875
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

05:24.975 --> 05:25.456
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

05:26.117 --> 05:27.578
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand this.

05:28.259 --> 05:28.959
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this thing work?

05:28.979 --> 05:30.561
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing reads like stereo instructions.

05:30.641 --> 05:31.282
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this on?

05:31.302 --> 05:31.862
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell?

05:34.405 --> 05:38.189
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio, Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.

05:38.269 --> 05:38.589
[SPEAKER_05]: What the?

05:40.333 --> 05:41.334
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of our old promos.

05:41.654 --> 05:42.074
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta love that.

05:42.274 --> 05:43.215
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, RetroOLR.

05:43.775 --> 05:44.536
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed the beep.

05:44.596 --> 05:46.937
[SPEAKER_03]: The beep was from R10K.

05:47.017 --> 05:49.138
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, alright.

05:49.258 --> 05:49.759
[SPEAKER_05]: No, for reals.

05:49.819 --> 05:51.780
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta get through this or I swear to God we'll be here all night.

05:51.820 --> 05:52.280
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here we go.

05:53.201 --> 05:54.081
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was QQQ.

05:54.201 --> 05:55.502
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, shut up.

05:55.682 --> 05:56.403
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody, shut up.

05:56.963 --> 05:57.403
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my time.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.205
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki has this look at, you're gonna fuck up.

06:00.405 --> 06:01.626
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna fuck up.

06:03.487 --> 06:04.428
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I fucked up.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.107
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't doing anything.

06:07.127 --> 06:08.207
[SPEAKER_06]: You were giving me that look.

06:08.247 --> 06:10.308
[SPEAKER_05]: You were like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

06:11.229 --> 06:12.309
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not doing anything.

06:13.409 --> 06:14.530
[SPEAKER_04]: You willed it to happen.

06:16.491 --> 06:17.931
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just watching him talk.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.613
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to God I quit.

06:20.733 --> 06:20.993
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

06:22.393 --> 06:24.054
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo-hoo, we have DarkSakura Radio.

06:24.254 --> 06:24.955
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, no, we don't.

06:25.035 --> 06:25.895
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here we go.

06:30.342 --> 06:31.583
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not even looking at you.

06:31.603 --> 06:33.384
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you know what?

06:33.685 --> 06:34.985
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuckin' A. I'm turning around.

06:37.527 --> 06:38.508
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm turning around.

06:38.528 --> 06:39.509
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude.

06:41.806 --> 06:43.767
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do we have you on this program anyway?

06:43.927 --> 06:49.270
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is you talking.

06:49.330 --> 06:50.451
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.232
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's DarkSakura.

06:52.752 --> 06:53.512
[SPEAKER_04]: Right at you.

06:53.833 --> 06:57.915
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, how am I not supposed to laugh at that?

06:57.955 --> 07:01.977
[SPEAKER_03]: For the sake of the chat room, I was leaning over my laptop, staring at Rob intently.

07:02.917 --> 07:04.178
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to be a duck.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.334
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

07:08.354 --> 07:09.815
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a drunk show.

07:09.956 --> 07:10.756
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop filming.

07:11.597 --> 07:15.780
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to turn around and not look at you people so I can get through this segment.

07:15.820 --> 07:18.662
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki, be ready with a Tomb Raider story and no more giggling.

07:18.862 --> 07:20.103
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we have a Tomb Raider story.

07:20.143 --> 07:20.624
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here we go.

07:23.326 --> 07:23.666
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

07:24.206 --> 07:24.867
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

07:25.027 --> 07:25.547
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.

07:25.708 --> 07:25.988
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

07:26.708 --> 07:28.410
[SPEAKER_05]: Know how Bobby Black by himself.

07:29.050 --> 07:30.711
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm starting to wonder if that's not a bad idea.

07:30.731 --> 07:31.412
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pushing your head.

07:34.214 --> 07:34.494
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

07:35.035 --> 07:35.355
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

07:58.615 --> 08:00.876
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're back here with the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth.

08:00.936 --> 08:03.638
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that portion of the show that's too hot to podcast.

08:03.798 --> 08:04.618
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sticky.

08:04.879 --> 08:06.259
[SPEAKER_05]: It's perverted.

08:08.481 --> 08:13.503
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the cage match coming up, which is pretty much going to be just about all we do tonight because we're already at 9 o'clock.

08:13.543 --> 08:15.004
[SPEAKER_05]: That was an awfully long show tonight.

08:15.805 --> 08:18.406
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if you would quit laughing so much during the show.

08:18.426 --> 08:18.866
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

08:18.906 --> 08:20.387
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the show itself.

08:20.527 --> 08:22.929
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes out on the stream, don't stop it.

08:24.589 --> 08:28.170
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes out on the podcast stream, it won't be very long, but it was like 20 minutes of giggle fits.

08:28.350 --> 08:28.971
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

08:29.091 --> 08:32.292
[SPEAKER_05]: I recorded it on my fancy video camera.

08:32.392 --> 08:32.912
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what is it?

08:33.952 --> 08:35.453
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to do a video cast then?

08:35.773 --> 08:37.934
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the next step?

08:38.014 --> 08:38.174
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

08:38.574 --> 08:41.175
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to, but this is mainly for E3.

08:41.195 --> 08:42.035
[SPEAKER_00]: Get me a burka then.

08:42.395 --> 08:49.388
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as we know, we were talking about what we're doing, our plans for E3, special plans that no one's doing yet.

08:49.688 --> 08:55.579
[SPEAKER_06]: That's mainly what it's for, so I can walk through the entire booth and cover everything and that kind of stuff.

08:56.707 --> 08:57.747
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that video camera.

08:57.767 --> 09:02.428
[SPEAKER_06]: The only problem is the still pictures it takes aren't 100% good.

09:02.608 --> 09:06.229
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like 640x480, not really even a 1 megapixel.

09:06.849 --> 09:13.171
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I figured I'm cropping down most of the pictures anyways, I don't think it really matters.

09:14.171 --> 09:14.971
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

09:17.172 --> 09:18.612
[SPEAKER_06]: But it'll be pretty cool.

09:21.727 --> 09:26.969
[SPEAKER_05]: In random news, it's Bomani related, Sephiroth1215 sent me a private message in chat.

09:26.989 --> 09:28.069
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you don't mind me sharing that.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.630
[SPEAKER_05]: But he sent me a link over to Konami's website here.

09:31.090 --> 09:33.711
[SPEAKER_05]: And Konami has a page here for DDR Supernova.

09:34.172 --> 09:36.192
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says, release date, available now.

09:37.473 --> 09:38.233
[SPEAKER_05]: Lies.

09:38.553 --> 09:41.054
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a webmaster at Konami that's about to get fired.

09:41.274 --> 09:41.714
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray.

09:41.814 --> 09:43.315
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you email somebody about that?

09:43.355 --> 09:44.415
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would I email anybody about that?

09:44.435 --> 09:45.336
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't you fix that?

09:45.376 --> 09:46.076
[SPEAKER_05]: You work for him?

09:46.196 --> 09:48.097
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't you fire somebody?

09:48.937 --> 09:49.257
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

09:51.551 --> 09:54.814
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent you a link to my Flash thingy and you never said anything.

09:55.214 --> 09:55.515
[SPEAKER_05]: When?

09:56.095 --> 09:58.477
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent you an IM a few days ago.

09:59.538 --> 10:00.399
[SPEAKER_05]: Was I at work?

10:00.779 --> 10:01.860
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because he's rude.

10:02.280 --> 10:02.541
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

10:02.801 --> 10:04.522
[SPEAKER_05]: And I leave my IM up.

10:04.542 --> 10:06.544
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to pull it up and I'm going to show you on my laptop.

10:06.584 --> 10:09.026
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know you need to friend me now once you get a game.

10:10.307 --> 10:11.428
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I get a game.

10:11.969 --> 10:12.849
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even have to get a game.

10:12.909 --> 10:16.272
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy some of those Xbox Live arcade games.

10:16.392 --> 10:17.914
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll probably get Geometry Wars.

10:19.266 --> 10:21.747
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you download the ghost recon thing or something?

10:21.767 --> 10:22.808
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I'm busy.

10:23.208 --> 10:23.949
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to me later.

10:26.910 --> 10:30.472
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to do a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, but I don't think I really care about these people anymore.

10:31.093 --> 10:36.036
[SPEAKER_05]: So, let's get into tonight's cage match, shall we?

10:36.756 --> 10:37.797
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what were you talking about?

10:37.857 --> 10:38.537
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm not busy.

10:38.817 --> 10:41.879
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put that on my resume and I want you to have people hire me.

10:43.328 --> 10:43.588
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

11:14.212 --> 11:14.995
[SPEAKER_05]: Cache Match!

11:16.660 --> 11:17.483
[SPEAKER_03]: I vote for Holic.

11:18.246 --> 11:18.928
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna get busted.

11:18.948 --> 11:20.293
[SPEAKER_05]: Three songs, do battle.

11:22.006 --> 11:25.028
[SPEAKER_05]: and now I have the giggles again.

11:25.808 --> 11:26.989
[SPEAKER_05]: Three songs do battle.

11:27.049 --> 11:28.870
[SPEAKER_05]: Each host picks their favorite song.

11:28.890 --> 11:29.671
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Cage Match.

11:30.011 --> 11:30.351
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

11:30.531 --> 11:32.532
[SPEAKER_05]: Three hosts pick their favorite song.

11:32.552 --> 11:33.113
[SPEAKER_05]: They do battle.

11:33.153 --> 11:35.254
[SPEAKER_05]: Your guys' votes in the chat room determine the winner.

11:35.774 --> 11:41.177
[SPEAKER_05]: And it goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music program.

11:41.457 --> 11:44.139
[SPEAKER_05]: Started off with song number one, which won the Cage Match last week.

11:44.179 --> 11:44.959
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Babyland.

11:45.420 --> 11:45.660
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?

11:46.160 --> 11:49.202
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Babyland, who I'm going to see on April 15th in Berkeley.

11:49.762 --> 11:53.923
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Babyland had this song called Gary?

11:54.143 --> 11:55.283
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that how you say it?

11:55.363 --> 11:55.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Gary?

11:55.803 --> 11:56.563
[SPEAKER_05]: Gary, Gary.

11:57.044 --> 12:00.464
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well it won last week's Cage Match with its funky indie sound.

12:00.884 --> 12:03.885
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I said it sounded like the Postal Service on crack or something, I don't remember.

12:04.165 --> 12:04.545
[SPEAKER_05]: But here it is.

12:04.565 --> 12:08.546
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of their stuff is more industrial sounding, but this I thought was very synth poppy.

12:08.786 --> 12:09.366
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here it is.

12:09.906 --> 12:10.506
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

12:11.066 --> 12:12.647
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number one, Babyland.

12:12.907 --> 12:13.167
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

12:22.588 --> 12:23.576
Thank you for watching!

13:10.618 --> 13:11.442
Thanks for watching!

13:46.778 --> 13:50.164
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, song number two in tonight's cage match is coming up.

13:50.284 --> 13:53.750
[SPEAKER_05]: That, once again, was song number one, Babyland, with Jerry.

13:54.752 --> 13:59.360
[SPEAKER_05]: And song number two is going to be a challenger, and it's my pick.

14:00.350 --> 14:01.951
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a band called Goldfrap.

14:02.532 --> 14:04.273
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I think Goldfrap is just the name of the girl.

14:05.434 --> 14:06.955
[SPEAKER_05]: You know she's got a lot of people helping her out.

14:07.495 --> 14:10.838
[SPEAKER_05]: Goldfrap has a song from her new CD, Supernature is the CD.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.759
[SPEAKER_05]: The song is called Ooh La La.

14:13.459 --> 14:14.460
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like this song.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.041
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of pornotastic.

14:16.061 --> 14:17.002
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's my pick tonight.

14:17.342 --> 14:18.803
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh La La by Goldfrap.

14:18.943 --> 14:19.344
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

14:19.704 --> 14:20.084
[SPEAKER_05]: Or don't.

14:20.124 --> 14:20.685
[SPEAKER_05]: See if I care.

14:28.851 --> 14:29.491
Ooh La La

14:53.611 --> 14:58.193
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to touch you, you're just made for love

16:16.688 --> 16:18.212
Thanks for watching!

17:00.459 --> 17:02.020
That was it, that was uh...

17:29.867 --> 17:33.089
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number two there in the cage match, Ooh La La by GoldFrap.

17:33.930 --> 17:35.591
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that ending, though.

17:35.731 --> 17:39.214
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know what, that was part of a song I'm not supposed to be playing.

17:39.234 --> 17:44.278
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoops!

17:44.338 --> 17:49.422
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, what did you guys think of Ooh La La by GoldFrap?

17:50.442 --> 17:52.924
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov, she needs to quit smoking, one.

17:55.060 --> 17:57.542
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what did you think of Oolala by GoldPrap?

17:58.022 --> 18:00.804
[SPEAKER_06]: I recognized... I don't know, it was okay.

18:01.084 --> 18:02.986
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good stripper music, I guess.

18:04.367 --> 18:05.848
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be called GoldFap.

18:09.030 --> 18:09.710
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it would be like 7.5.

18:12.072 --> 18:13.694
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, how would you rate the bathroom?

18:14.094 --> 18:14.975
[SPEAKER_05]: Or wherever you just were.

18:15.035 --> 18:17.317
[SPEAKER_03]: I could hear the music from the bathroom, thank you.

18:17.337 --> 18:18.138
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you like?

18:18.838 --> 18:19.419
[SPEAKER_03]: It was poopy.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.462
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

18:22.922 --> 18:25.124
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually liked what I heard of it.

18:25.344 --> 18:28.507
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little repetitive, but it gets an 8.

18:28.667 --> 18:30.889
[SPEAKER_05]: That is totally fucking music.

18:31.710 --> 18:32.110
[SPEAKER_05]: I give it a 9.

18:34.341 --> 18:36.082
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit, I forgot kids listen to this show, my bad.

18:36.563 --> 18:40.126
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, song number three tonight comes from Cheater Loki.

18:40.586 --> 18:42.428
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheater, Cheater, Cheater Loki.

18:42.848 --> 18:43.488
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, listen.

18:43.749 --> 18:45.550
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not support Cheater Loki tonight.

18:45.610 --> 18:48.913
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, I did the same thing when Kingdom Hearts 1 came out, okay?

18:48.953 --> 18:55.118
[SPEAKER_06]: So obviously my choice is going to be Utada Hikaru with Passion, because that is a team song.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.982
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here's song number three from Cheating Loki.

19:00.442 --> 19:01.923
[SPEAKER_05]: Utada Hikaru with Passion.

19:02.404 --> 19:02.644
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

19:17.251 --> 19:18.154
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

19:53.937 --> 19:56.039
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

20:51.844 --> 20:52.966
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

21:12.954 --> 21:14.295
Thank you for watching!

21:41.259 --> 21:42.828
Thank you for watching!

22:38.468 --> 22:40.135
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

23:43.919 --> 23:47.061
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, song number three tonight, Utada Hikaru with Passion.

23:47.081 --> 23:48.902
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that.

23:48.962 --> 23:49.842
[SPEAKER_05]: Who started us off last time?

23:49.862 --> 23:50.443
[SPEAKER_05]: Miklatov.

23:51.203 --> 23:53.424
[SPEAKER_04]: It was long and had bad camera angles.

23:53.484 --> 23:54.245
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a one.

23:55.225 --> 23:55.646
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

23:55.666 --> 23:58.267
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that song.

23:58.707 --> 24:00.008
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the guitar.

24:00.228 --> 24:03.130
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing I remember of it each time.

24:04.371 --> 24:07.953
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet you used the version without the guitar bridge in the middle, like in the opening video.

24:08.424 --> 24:08.864
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

24:08.944 --> 24:10.686
[SPEAKER_06]: I was pressed for time.

24:10.806 --> 24:12.247
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I had a feeling.

24:13.268 --> 24:13.788
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a hunch.

24:15.669 --> 24:16.350
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

24:16.370 --> 24:17.671
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

24:18.532 --> 24:19.092
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave it a 9.

24:20.153 --> 24:20.713
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

24:20.893 --> 24:30.380
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like this song, although as far as I thought that Hikaru was better as far as an opening song.

24:31.381 --> 24:31.541
[SPEAKER_03]: This...

24:33.931 --> 24:38.352
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I really like the song, it's a problem, but I just don't like things about it.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.093
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gets a 7.

24:41.813 --> 24:45.134
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the opening song to Kingdom Hearts 2 should have been Easy Breezy.

24:45.534 --> 24:47.154
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think that would have been much better.

24:47.294 --> 24:49.175
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, you could have like Sora skipping down.

24:49.435 --> 24:51.636
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as dramatic.

24:52.036 --> 24:52.676
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, no, I...

24:54.045 --> 24:58.789
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that song a lot, but it's already in rotation, so I give it a five.

24:59.229 --> 25:02.012
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, don't get me wrong, I love that song, but Loki sucks.

25:02.092 --> 25:05.575
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

25:06.736 --> 25:10.679
[SPEAKER_05]: Babyland with Jerry, song number one.

25:20.959 --> 25:27.727
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and song number two you can vote for tonight is Gold Frap with Ooh La La is the name of that song.

25:36.456 --> 25:42.183
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is from Loki, and it's Utada Hikaru with Passion.

25:45.572 --> 25:45.952
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't listening.

26:14.721 --> 26:16.363
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura has a memory like an elephant.

26:16.863 --> 26:19.406
[SPEAKER_05]: She don't forget.

26:20.607 --> 26:21.668
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a slightly different version.

26:21.688 --> 26:23.309
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you talking about?

26:23.329 --> 26:23.930
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't forget.

26:26.873 --> 26:27.293
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

26:28.134 --> 26:30.356
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the one we have in rotation does have the guitar riff.

26:30.396 --> 26:31.757
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the one from the movie.

26:31.898 --> 26:32.979
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the short one.

26:32.999 --> 26:33.219
[SPEAKER_05]: Sigh.

26:36.135 --> 26:36.415
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

26:36.475 --> 26:41.378
[SPEAKER_03]: And, dude, I'm going to hit FoodManiac64 with a trout now for being a butt.

26:41.398 --> 26:41.978
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

26:42.018 --> 26:42.358
[SPEAKER_05]: Do so.

26:42.879 --> 26:46.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he told everyone not to vote for my song so they'd play his.

26:46.861 --> 26:48.942
[SPEAKER_03]: But I haven't guaranteed that I'll play his song.

26:48.962 --> 26:49.162
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

26:49.222 --> 26:52.504
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I told people I'd play their songs like three months ago, and I still haven't.

26:52.644 --> 26:54.085
[SPEAKER_05]: Just keep dangling out there.

26:54.105 --> 26:55.385
[SPEAKER_01]: He emailed me four times.

26:55.725 --> 26:56.286
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell him to stop.

26:56.526 --> 26:57.026
[SPEAKER_05]: Block him.

26:58.567 --> 26:58.747
Ah.

27:00.208 --> 27:00.608
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

27:01.810 --> 27:06.774
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, since I need some time here to tabulate votes, I need filler, so we're gonna go around and do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

27:06.914 --> 27:08.315
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how was your week, how was your day?

27:08.695 --> 27:09.116
[SPEAKER_03]: Shitty!

27:09.556 --> 27:10.176
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, poopy.

27:12.478 --> 27:14.039
[SPEAKER_03]: No, my week was actually pretty good.

27:14.059 --> 27:15.000
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got more stuff to do.

27:15.220 --> 27:23.226
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my whole crappy work situation has improved to such a degree that I no longer feel like I'm going to kill people and then myself in a big emo fit.

27:23.846 --> 27:28.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, I just feel like, you know, I'm going to mildly maim people and, you know, not, like, actually kill them, you know.

27:30.273 --> 27:31.454
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm no longer disgruntled.

27:32.034 --> 27:33.674
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm slightly annoyed, but not disgruntled.

27:36.276 --> 27:38.717
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also been playing a lot of Ragnarok online.

27:39.957 --> 27:43.619
[SPEAKER_03]: As of today, my primary character is 5441.

27:43.839 --> 27:50.561
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have to get job 50 before I can go assassin.

27:50.581 --> 27:54.063
[SPEAKER_03]: I donated some money to their server, so I got a bunch of free stuff for it.

27:54.103 --> 27:56.524
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a kiddie band now, and it makes me a very happy bunny.

28:01.540 --> 28:02.360
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a kitty band.

28:04.081 --> 28:04.941
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to see pictures.

28:06.001 --> 28:06.761
[SPEAKER_03]: I will send you pictures.

28:07.442 --> 28:08.642
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got a bunch of cards too.

28:08.702 --> 28:11.703
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a thief bug card and no footwear that I can put it on.

28:13.803 --> 28:14.824
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I need a zombie card.

28:17.504 --> 28:18.705
[SPEAKER_03]: Because zombies are awesome.

28:19.065 --> 28:19.665
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a hot dog.

28:22.226 --> 28:23.026
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your week?

28:23.046 --> 28:23.366
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your day?

28:24.412 --> 28:25.773
[SPEAKER_06]: My weekend day was okay.

28:26.374 --> 28:35.523
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to move my desk tomorrow because we do this thing every once in a while once we fire a bunch of people where we do the floor layout shuffle.

28:36.544 --> 28:37.485
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are fun.

28:38.346 --> 28:40.108
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for no apparent reason.

28:41.490 --> 28:44.873
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll move people one desk over just...

28:45.774 --> 28:46.635
[SPEAKER_06]: for the hell of it.

28:46.876 --> 28:47.857
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of fun.

28:48.158 --> 28:49.981
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, so I gotta move my desk.

28:50.021 --> 28:56.410
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get my review next week, which should be interesting because my phone time sucks, but I'm the smartest one there.

28:56.671 --> 28:58.894
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it kind of evens out.

28:59.495 --> 28:59.996
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um...

29:01.550 --> 29:01.850
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

29:02.010 --> 29:02.571
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be cool.

29:02.751 --> 29:03.972
[SPEAKER_06]: We're supposed to be getting our bonuses.

29:05.213 --> 29:11.979
[SPEAKER_06]: My co-worker taught me this really cool thing with our bonus because they take out twice the amount of taxes as they normally would on your bonus checks.

29:12.039 --> 29:17.243
[SPEAKER_06]: So where I potentially could get $2,000, I only get like $1,100 or something.

29:17.703 --> 29:22.987
[SPEAKER_06]: So what you do is you put out another W4 or whatever for...

29:25.322 --> 29:30.245
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, exempt for that week, so I get my full $2,000, which is going to a laptop.

29:30.565 --> 29:34.407
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um... What else?

29:34.487 --> 29:38.390
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I got my spiffy camera, which you'll hopefully see some more content for the PSP site.

29:38.650 --> 29:47.075
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the, uh... One of the main reasons was for that, so I can record some of my stuff at, you know... Well, I'm probably going to record stuff at my bachelor party, because...

29:48.373 --> 29:50.654
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens at Bachelor Party stays at Bachelor Party.

29:51.635 --> 29:55.317
[SPEAKER_06]: And also... Do you know what they have planned for your Bachelor Party?

29:55.377 --> 29:56.557
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't.

29:57.998 --> 29:59.599
[SPEAKER_05]: I do, but that's all I can say.

29:59.839 --> 30:00.099
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

30:00.899 --> 30:05.422
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, the other thing is just your recording wedding stuff.

30:05.962 --> 30:10.524
[SPEAKER_06]: Just it's really fun to play with that camera because it has a 20 gig hard drive in there so you can store tons of video.

30:11.285 --> 30:13.506
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of video coming from E3, that's for sure.

30:13.666 --> 30:15.967
[SPEAKER_06]: So look forward to that and lots of pictures.

30:17.108 --> 30:17.268
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

30:19.164 --> 30:20.448
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's about all I have.

30:21.652 --> 30:22.355
[SPEAKER_05]: Mikotov, how was your week?

30:23.396 --> 30:24.637
[SPEAKER_04]: My week was boring.

30:24.937 --> 30:26.058
[SPEAKER_04]: Work is boring.

30:26.358 --> 30:27.119
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sick of it.

30:27.959 --> 30:36.865
[SPEAKER_04]: And then today, slash last night, got myself hyped up to go to Best Buy and wait in a non-existent line at 3 in the morning.

30:37.606 --> 30:38.927
[SPEAKER_04]: That didn't go so well.

30:40.168 --> 30:41.148
[SPEAKER_04]: Best Buy sucks.

30:41.889 --> 30:50.035
[SPEAKER_04]: And then tomorrow, somebody new that we hired is going to be sitting in my office and I'm not looking forward to that because I hate new people and I will not talk to them.

30:52.088 --> 30:53.009
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not a team player.

30:53.489 --> 30:55.190
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to be a team player.

30:55.650 --> 30:57.131
[SPEAKER_04]: They invaded my space.

30:57.671 --> 30:58.471
[SPEAKER_04]: They can go away.

30:59.832 --> 31:04.735
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I, um... Oh, we started playing Tetris DS at work.

31:05.295 --> 31:06.555
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's over already.

31:06.776 --> 31:09.777
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of people suck and whine too much like me.

31:09.857 --> 31:10.958
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to Apples and Apples.

31:11.298 --> 31:12.879
[SPEAKER_04]: Apples to Apples is occasionally played.

31:13.099 --> 31:16.841
[SPEAKER_04]: We recently discovered the joy of Team Mario Kart.

31:17.701 --> 31:18.161
[SPEAKER_04]: at break.

31:18.601 --> 31:19.141
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really fun.

31:19.161 --> 31:19.882
[SPEAKER_04]: Team Mario Kart.

31:19.902 --> 31:21.102
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and reverses.

31:21.382 --> 31:26.403
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're setting up the options like 150 and computer difficulty if you have computers and all that, there's an option for team.

31:26.983 --> 31:29.324
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can actually do a four-on-four team.

31:30.204 --> 31:41.527
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's pretty much like a regular race, except you have a color icon, like red or blue, and you can still attack your own teammates, but how it works is it's an overall point total for your team.

31:41.967 --> 31:42.387
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

31:42.407 --> 31:44.607
[SPEAKER_04]: You're no longer working just to be the best.

31:44.888 --> 31:45.868
[SPEAKER_04]: You're working as a team.

31:45.968 --> 31:46.148
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

31:47.267 --> 31:52.750
[SPEAKER_04]: We started out last week when the losers were still playing Tetris, me and the person in my room, or in my office.

31:53.431 --> 32:03.557
[SPEAKER_04]: We played it with computers and he got screwed over twice with really bad computer players, but it's really fun actually, and I didn't even think Mario Kart could be more fun than it already was.

32:03.857 --> 32:04.958
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32:20.937 --> 32:26.401
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we're playing without power-ups because, you know, they got pissed off at that because I won the rankings this month.

32:27.061 --> 32:34.486
[SPEAKER_06]: So this next month now, we're just trying to... I want to do team games, but the problem is we don't get enough people to participate.

32:34.506 --> 32:39.810
[SPEAKER_06]: You can only do six, and some people are gone or busy and stuff, and that kind of makes it unfair.

32:39.870 --> 32:45.173
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I don't know, we're looking forward to, like, maybe Liberty City Stories when it comes out on PlayStation 2.

32:45.373 --> 32:49.997
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully we'll have multiplayer, and then we can land together some PS2s and play it that way.

32:50.797 --> 32:51.177
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

32:52.057 --> 32:52.478
[SPEAKER_06]: Might be fun.

32:52.498 --> 32:53.058
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be fun.

32:54.998 --> 32:56.579
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, how was your weekend?

32:56.879 --> 32:57.499
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fine.

32:58.420 --> 33:00.240
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides the whole male PMS thing, I was fine.

33:00.260 --> 33:00.860
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a fine week.

33:01.921 --> 33:07.343
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to the gym today and my trainer pretty much told me officially today that I'm fat, which was good to hear.

33:09.517 --> 33:10.638
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was referring to.

33:10.658 --> 33:13.161
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I had to take the little machine that measures your body fat.

33:13.882 --> 33:15.463
[SPEAKER_03]: And you hold it in your hands like away from your body.

33:15.483 --> 33:16.024
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

33:16.084 --> 33:17.385
[SPEAKER_05]: And it did the little boop, boop, boop thing.

33:17.405 --> 33:18.086
[SPEAKER_03]: The BMI scale.

33:18.126 --> 33:18.907
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, and then I turned it.

33:19.107 --> 33:21.310
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, and he looked at the number and then he turned it around and said.

33:21.997 --> 33:24.019
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, you're right here in the high one.

33:24.039 --> 33:25.259
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, thanks.

33:25.840 --> 33:26.320
[SPEAKER_05]: But oh well.

33:26.821 --> 33:28.462
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I already knew that was coming anyway.

33:28.502 --> 33:31.144
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the whole reason I signed up for the gym.

33:31.224 --> 33:34.726
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just have to make sure I go regularly.

33:34.827 --> 33:36.328
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool that you have a trainer, though.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.949
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the only thing I'd be able to do.

33:38.509 --> 33:40.150
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I only get them one more time for free.

33:40.431 --> 33:41.852
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'd have to pay for them if I want to keep them.

33:41.872 --> 33:44.714
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, if you come to my gym with me, I'll work out with you and show you what to do.

33:45.074 --> 33:51.658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that I don't know what to do, I just, you know, I need the motivation is a huge thing.

33:51.778 --> 33:53.339
[SPEAKER_05]: Put a cupcake in front of you.

33:55.546 --> 33:59.628
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise you, next Monday, nothing will stand in between us going to spin.

33:59.708 --> 34:00.008
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

34:00.828 --> 34:01.128
[SPEAKER_05]: Word.

34:01.208 --> 34:03.109
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they do spin at this gym, too.

34:03.349 --> 34:05.490
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to go to my trainer's spin.

34:05.870 --> 34:07.731
[SPEAKER_05]: She's vicious.

34:07.751 --> 34:11.472
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked my trainer if you could come to this club, and he said with a guest pass you can.

34:12.113 --> 34:14.754
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll have to come to one of our classes sometime, see if you enjoy it.

34:14.954 --> 34:15.674
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

34:15.714 --> 34:16.314
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring me a guest pass.

34:16.614 --> 34:16.814
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

34:17.395 --> 34:17.755
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it.

34:17.835 --> 34:18.175
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on.

34:18.835 --> 34:20.096
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll pick a class to do.

34:20.396 --> 34:21.816
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the summer we can go swimming.

34:21.977 --> 34:22.937
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do yoga or something.

34:23.097 --> 34:24.240
[SPEAKER_03]: I got all the stuff to do lap swimming.

34:29.713 --> 34:30.673
[SPEAKER_05]: They're outdoors, though.

34:30.754 --> 34:32.194
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was indoors when I signed up.

34:32.334 --> 34:36.555
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the ones I have a membership for over here has a lap pool outside.

34:36.955 --> 34:37.936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the snooty one, though.

34:37.976 --> 34:40.116
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to do the indoor pool somewhere.

34:40.136 --> 34:41.216
[SPEAKER_05]: Roseville.

34:42.137 --> 34:42.897
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to Roseville.

34:42.937 --> 34:45.118
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Roseville has three indoor pools.

34:45.678 --> 34:46.598
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hi.

34:48.278 --> 34:50.019
[SPEAKER_05]: Shall we announce who won tonight's cage match?

34:50.759 --> 34:52.540
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a good way to get close to the end here.

34:53.120 --> 34:53.420
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

34:53.480 --> 34:56.541
[SPEAKER_05]: The winning song of tonight's cage match was...

34:57.441 --> 34:58.422
[SPEAKER_05]: A tie!

34:59.242 --> 35:02.905
[SPEAKER_05]: And here are the two songs... Okay, you know how ties work.

35:02.945 --> 35:04.166
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's song number one that tied.

35:05.367 --> 35:06.047
[SPEAKER_05]: Baby Man.

35:09.249 --> 35:10.870
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's song number two that tied.

35:13.972 --> 35:15.894
[SPEAKER_05]: Passion, Utada Hikaru.

35:16.754 --> 35:20.477
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the old Orange Lounge Radio rulebook... I wonder where this is going.

35:20.497 --> 35:24.480
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that when two songs tie, the host who got screwed over... Oh, that's me.

35:24.860 --> 35:26.161
[SPEAKER_05]: Gets to break the tie...

35:27.802 --> 35:30.443
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, see, I could be ironic and vote for your pick, Loki.

35:31.224 --> 35:32.744
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Jamie could hate me all night.

35:33.245 --> 35:33.985
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be fun.

35:35.866 --> 35:43.709
[SPEAKER_05]: But, no, I can't do that because, you know, you totally picked a song that was already in rotation, so I think you both end up winning anyway.

35:44.109 --> 35:51.913
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am picking for Jamie's song, I'm picking Jamie's song, Babyland, because I like the fact that they sound like Postal Service on track.

35:53.034 --> 35:54.294
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so two weeks in a row.

35:55.535 --> 35:55.935
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

35:57.748 --> 35:58.889
[SPEAKER_03]: Babyland for the win!

35:59.229 --> 36:00.830
[SPEAKER_05]: Two weeks in a row, not too shabby.

36:01.431 --> 36:03.512
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody has to go to their show in Berkeley.

36:03.692 --> 36:05.754
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the stripper song was only one vote behind.

36:06.414 --> 36:07.335
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was close.

36:07.355 --> 36:08.196
[SPEAKER_03]: We were all up there.

36:08.776 --> 36:10.077
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all winners.

36:10.217 --> 36:11.618
[SPEAKER_04]: Except Rob's not as much of a winner.

36:11.658 --> 36:16.362
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one vote for Pat, that one song, one vote for Jamie's song, and zero votes for yours.

36:17.703 --> 36:18.584
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, something like that.

36:19.522 --> 36:21.543
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was both of our listeners right there.

36:21.783 --> 36:22.203
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.

36:22.423 --> 36:24.744
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, it's about 9.30 and I think it's time to call it a night.

36:24.784 --> 36:25.445
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you kids think?

36:25.705 --> 36:26.365
[SPEAKER_03]: I want ice cream.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.146
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thirsty.

36:27.206 --> 36:27.826
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hungry.

36:28.566 --> 36:29.507
I want a cupcake.

36:32.448 --> 36:34.369
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're... No, I think I ate the last one.

36:35.850 --> 36:36.390
[SPEAKER_04]: Bastard!

36:37.390 --> 36:37.830
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's fine.

36:37.870 --> 36:40.111
[SPEAKER_05]: I need... Oh, I want Boba.

36:40.292 --> 36:41.532
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 23rd Magus.

36:41.572 --> 36:42.493
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear you there.

36:42.893 --> 36:45.294
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know, TAPEX is open.

36:47.107 --> 36:47.548
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it!

36:47.708 --> 36:48.489
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it, all of you!

36:48.749 --> 36:52.032
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got told I'm fat today!

36:52.212 --> 36:54.694
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get you some nice wheatgrass.

36:54.714 --> 36:55.815
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want wheatgrass.

36:56.535 --> 36:58.036
[SPEAKER_05]: I want bulimia right about now.

36:58.657 --> 36:59.017
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

36:59.418 --> 37:02.360
[SPEAKER_03]: Then fine, I'll get you a bottle of Ipecac.

37:03.641 --> 37:03.981
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

37:04.602 --> 37:05.563
[SPEAKER_05]: And a toothbrush.

37:08.785 --> 37:09.886
[SPEAKER_05]: That's disgusting.

37:10.687 --> 37:11.868
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you wanted bulimia.

37:12.318 --> 37:15.761
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sorry chat room, I ignored your FUs tonight, maybe next week.

37:16.501 --> 37:21.505
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight was supposed to be a slow news night, we went on forever, but of course I think that little giggle fit had something to do with it.

37:21.545 --> 37:22.145
[SPEAKER_03]: Your giggle fit, okay Rob.

37:22.165 --> 37:22.866
[SPEAKER_03]: My giggle fit?

37:22.886 --> 37:25.247
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you were the only one laughing in the microphone.

37:25.268 --> 37:26.188
[SPEAKER_03]: We were laughing at you.

37:26.248 --> 37:28.270
[SPEAKER_05]: I have your giggle fit on camera, so.

37:28.470 --> 37:29.090
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, shut up.

37:29.110 --> 37:29.511
[SPEAKER_05]: Partial.

37:29.731 --> 37:30.371
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here it is.

37:30.892 --> 37:32.052
[SPEAKER_05]: Your fortune cookie message.

37:32.093 --> 37:34.034
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost said your moment of zen.

37:34.054 --> 37:35.055
[SPEAKER_05]: Your fortune cookie message.

37:35.075 --> 37:35.995
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you still want to be a duck?

37:36.396 --> 37:36.956
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the day.

37:36.976 --> 37:38.017
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to be a duck.

37:41.479 --> 38:01.134
[SPEAKER_07]: We're tiny, we're toony, we're all a little loony And in this cartoony, we're invading your TV We're comic dispensers, we crack up all the censors On I'm a Toon Adventures, get a dose of comedy So here's at the anchors, it's a whole wide world apart Our homes, we only stand alone, a cartoon work of art
