01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
...

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
["Pomp and Circumstance"]

03:25.000 --> 03:38.400
You mentioned the fact that, uh, you nearly fell off the chair.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.000
I don't know how I almost fell into the wall, but that was just fun.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
And the extra person here talking about using it as a battery for your vibrator.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Let's talk about Wonder Shows Inn.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Oh yeah, let's talk about Wonder Shows Inn.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
I think I just took over the show. How about that?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Okay, Wonder Shows Inn is awesome.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
They told me how cool I am. Okay you start.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.440

04:01.440 --> 04:06.200
you're cool sorry not fairly hot cools wonder shows

04:06.200 --> 04:08.200
Yeah, which is great. You're fairly hot.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.200
I am. I am moderately hot.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.200
So, anyway.

04:20.200 --> 04:24.200
Hey, everybody. I just took over the show. How's about that?

04:24.200 --> 04:28.200
You took over the show? I think everybody should tell me how cool I am.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.200
You start.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.200
I'm not going to do this again.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.200
That sucks.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.960
I love the kid that was dressed up like Hitler and you know what's

04:39.960 --> 04:47.960
Trevor is the best beat kid on that show. Thank you for returning Rob. I like the kid about pills though. He's my favorite. Pills! Pills! Pills! Pills! Pills! Pills!

04:48.720 --> 04:50.720
Shut up

04:51.480 --> 04:56.280
I think the power brick should be bigger than the PSP. It should be like a 360 or Xbox

04:56.280 --> 05:01.820
He just slapped the back of the PSP. It should be a nuclear generator like the power packs in a

05:01.820 --> 05:08.660
Ghostbusters power brakes made out of solid metal it's just gets super hot

05:08.660 --> 05:19.860
cook eggs on it mmm eggs eggy hello hello is this thing on testing testing

05:19.860 --> 05:24.340

05:24.340 --> 05:28.900
radio show hello I don't understand this this thing works

05:28.900 --> 05:30.600
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.300
Is this on?

05:31.300 --> 05:31.900
What the hell?

05:34.100 --> 05:35.900
Orange Lounge Radio.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.200
Broke-down ghetto bimani radio.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.400
What the f***?

05:40.200 --> 05:41.500
That's one of our old promos.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.100
Kinda love that.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.300
Oh, RetroOLR.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.500
I missed the beep.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.300
The beep was from, um...

05:46.300 --> 05:47.500
R10K.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.100
Alright, alright, just...

05:49.100 --> 05:49.700
No, for reals.

05:49.700 --> 05:50.400
We gotta get through this.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.700
Or I swear to God, we'll be here all night.

05:51.700 --> 05:52.300
Alright, here we go.

05:52.900 --> 05:53.300
Tell it for yourself.

05:53.300 --> 05:54.300
I thought that was QQQ.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.000
Alright.

05:55.000 --> 05:55.500
Shut up.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.400
Everybody, shut up.

05:56.800 --> 05:57.400
It's my turn.

05:57.400 --> 06:04.040
Loki has this look at you're gonna fuck up you're gonna fuck up and then I fucked

06:04.040 --> 06:09.160
up I wasn't doing anything you were giving me that look you're like yeah

06:09.160 --> 06:17.520
yeah I'm not doing anything you willed it to happen I was just watching him

06:17.520 --> 06:24.520

06:24.520 --> 06:30.200

06:30.200 --> 06:34.200
i was not even looking at you know i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i

06:34.200 --> 06:37.420
i'm turning around

06:37.420 --> 06:41.720
i'm turning around

06:41.720 --> 06:47.680
why do we have you on this program anyway?

06:47.680 --> 06:51.000
okay this is you talking blah blah blah blah blah

06:51.000 --> 06:52.640
here's dark sakura

06:52.640 --> 06:55.640
right at you, and I turn over to her and she's like,

06:55.640 --> 06:57.640
and how am I not supposed to laugh at that?

06:57.640 --> 07:00.640
For the sake of the chat room, I was leaning over my laptop,

07:00.640 --> 07:02.640
staring at Rob intently.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.640
I don't want to be a duck.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.640
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

07:08.640 --> 07:11.640
This is not a drunk show. Stop filming.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.640
I'm going to turn around and not look at you people

07:14.640 --> 07:15.640
so I can get through this segment.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.640
So, Loki, be ready with a Tomb Raider story

07:17.640 --> 07:18.640
and no more giggling.

07:18.640 --> 07:19.640
Okie dokie.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.640
Yeah, we have a Tomb Raider story.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.800
okay

07:23.800 --> 07:28.480
seriously Jesus alright know how Bobby black by himself

07:28.480 --> 07:31.480
I'm starting to wonder if that's not a bad idea

07:31.480 --> 07:34.560
alright

07:34.560 --> 07:41.560
Here we go.

07:58.560 --> 08:01.880
And we're back here with the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth. It's that portion of the show

08:01.880 --> 08:09.440
that's too hot to podcast it's sticky it's it's perverted we have the cage

08:09.440 --> 08:12.200
match coming up which is pretty much gonna be just about all we do tonight

08:12.200 --> 08:14.920
because we're already at nine o'clock that was an awfully long show tonight

08:14.920 --> 08:19.240
but oh well maybe if you would quit laughing so much that's true it's not

08:19.240 --> 08:22.680
the show itself like when it's when it comes out on the stream it's don't stop

08:22.680 --> 08:26.800
it when it comes out on the podcast stream it won't be very long there was

08:26.800 --> 08:31.280
like yeah 20 minutes of giggle fits that's all right I recorded my fancy

08:31.280 --> 08:35.060
video camera okay what is it so we're gonna do are we gonna do a video cast

08:35.060 --> 08:40.980
then is that a little step no video we don't have to but this is mainly for

08:40.980 --> 08:46.820
e3 because as we know we were talking about what we're doing our plans for e3

08:46.820 --> 08:51.200
the special plans that no one's doing yeah that's mainly what's for so I can

08:51.200 --> 08:56.900
walk through the entire booth and cover everything and that kind of stuff I love

08:56.900 --> 09:02.720
that video camera. The other problem is the still pictures it takes aren't 100% good.

09:02.720 --> 09:10.080
They're like 640x480, not really even a 1 megapixel. But when I figured I'm cropping

09:10.080 --> 09:17.280
down most of the pictures anyways, I don't think it really matters. So, I don't know.

09:17.280 --> 09:21.740
But it'll be pretty cool.

09:21.740 --> 09:27.180
In random news, it's Bimani related, Sephiroth1215 sent me a private message in chat, hope you

09:27.180 --> 09:31.260
don't mind me sharing that, but he sent me a link over to Konami's website here, and

09:31.260 --> 09:36.740
Konami has a page here for DDR Supernova, and it says release date available now.

09:36.740 --> 09:37.740
Lies.

09:37.740 --> 09:41.260
I think there's a webmaster at Konami, it's about to get fired.

09:41.260 --> 09:42.260
Hurray.

09:42.260 --> 09:43.380
Why don't you email somebody about that?

09:43.380 --> 09:44.600
Why would I email anybody about that?

09:44.600 --> 09:45.600
Can't you fix that?

09:45.600 --> 09:46.600
You work for him?

09:46.600 --> 09:47.600
Can't you fire somebody?

09:47.600 --> 09:48.600
Do I care?

09:48.600 --> 09:49.600
Alright.

09:49.600 --> 09:54.920
I sent you a link to my flash thingy and you never said anything.

09:54.920 --> 09:58.600
When? I sent you an I.M. a few days ago.

09:58.600 --> 10:02.000
That's because I work? That's because he's rude.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.520
What? Can I leave my I.M. a phone network? I'm gonna pull it up and I'm gonna show you on my laptop.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.160
Well you know you need to friend me now once you get a game.

10:09.160 --> 10:14.080
Once I get a game. You don't even have to get a game. Buy some like of those

10:14.080 --> 10:18.160
Xbox Live arcade games. I'll probably get Geometry Wars.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.660
Didn't you download the ghost recon thing or something?

10:21.660 --> 10:25.660
Hold on, I'm busy. Talk to me later.

10:25.660 --> 10:30.660
I was going to do a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, but I don't think I really care about these people anymore.

10:30.660 --> 10:36.660
So, let's get into tonight's cage match, shall we?

10:36.660 --> 10:38.660
Okay, what were you talking about? Now I'm not busy.

10:38.660 --> 10:39.660
Oh, I know it's too late.

10:39.660 --> 10:42.660
I'm interested in it on my resume and I want you to have people hire me.

10:42.660 --> 10:45.660
I do talk to marketing now.

10:45.660 --> 10:47.160
I'm good friends with them since they give me feedback.

10:47.160 --> 10:53.520
You work at Konami can't you you that means you're you control everything over there right does I move to the Bay Area

10:53.520 --> 10:55.800
I do have a badge that gets me in every

10:56.040 --> 11:00.320
Konami you and not many people do you and Hideo Kojima are tight right yeah?

11:00.320 --> 11:04.040
We go out drinking and you know one together every day, right?

11:05.600 --> 11:07.600
No

11:09.960 --> 11:11.960
All right

11:11.960 --> 11:13.960
We only went to 8.1.

11:41.960 --> 11:46.620
song number one which won the cage match last week it was baby land yes yes baby

11:46.620 --> 11:52.100
land who I'm going to see on April 15th in Berkeley all right baby land had this

11:52.100 --> 11:57.620
song called Gary is that how you say Gary Gary Gary Gary all right well it

11:57.620 --> 12:01.540
won last week's cage match with its funky indie sound I think I said it

12:01.540 --> 12:04.420
sounded like the Postal Service on crack or something I don't remember but here

12:04.420 --> 12:08.000
it is a lot of stuff is more industrial sounding with this I thought was very

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
All right, here it is. Have a good one. Song number one, Babyland. Enjoy.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.500
We go on because we know there's nothing worth inquittin'

12:44.500 --> 12:51.000
To bow down to the negatives

12:51.000 --> 12:58.000
We hold strong because we know there's something worth awaiting

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
This is a part of me, I understand them

13:02.000 --> 13:08.000
I know I can't control the wonder of these clouds

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
It's building, it's building

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Don't tell me I'm wrong

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
I'm living hard to be part of something new

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
The straight lines and the stereotypes are gone

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
As nature continues to crawl

13:30.000 --> 13:50.420
All right, song number two in tonight's cage match is coming up.

13:50.420 --> 13:54.860
That once again was song number one, Babyland with Jerry.

13:54.860 --> 13:58.780
And song number two is going to be a challenger.

13:58.780 --> 14:03.760
And it's my pick, and it's a band called Goldfrap, actually I think Goldfrap is just the name

14:03.760 --> 14:07.540
of the girl, but you know she's got a lot of people helping her out.

14:07.540 --> 14:13.540
Goldfrap has this song from her new CD, Supernature is the CD, and the song is called Ooh La La,

14:13.540 --> 14:18.940
and I like this song, it's kind of pornotastic, so it's my pick tonight, Ooh La La by Goldfrap,

14:18.940 --> 14:25.940
enjoy or don't see if I care

14:48.940 --> 14:50.940
Turn me up

14:51.940 --> 14:54.940

15:01.940 --> 15:03.940
Turn me up

I need la la la la la la la

15:13.940 --> 15:16.940

15:16.940 --> 15:20.940

15:20.940 --> 15:23.940
I'm feeling la la la la

15:27.940 --> 15:33.940
Cause of the harmony

15:33.940 --> 15:40.940
I'm teasing and poaching

15:40.940 --> 15:43.940
Switch me on

15:43.940 --> 15:47.940
Turn me up

15:47.940 --> 15:53.940
I'll try to feast, you just made for love

15:53.940 --> 15:59.760
... phenalalalala...

15:59.760 --> 16:19.760
Scree-la-la-la-la-la, Scree-oo-la-la-la-la

16:29.760 --> 16:40.760
I'm gonna love some more, a little bit the same

16:40.760 --> 16:47.760
I'm gonna heal up your heart, I'm gonna walk again

16:47.760 --> 16:49.760
Yeah

16:49.760 --> 16:51.760
Yeah

16:51.760 --> 16:53.760
Yeah

17:23.760 --> 17:33.160
That was it, that was song number two there in the cage match, Ooh La La by Goldfrap.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.200
I love that ending though.

17:36.200 --> 17:41.800
You know what, that was part of a song I'm not supposed to be playing.

17:41.800 --> 17:42.800
Whoops!

17:42.800 --> 17:50.080
Anyway, what did you guys think of Ooh La La by Goldfrap?

17:50.080 --> 17:54.080
Uh, Miklotov, she needs to quit smoking, one.

17:55.080 --> 17:58.080
Loki, what did you think of Ooh La La by Gold Prep?

17:58.080 --> 18:01.080
I recognized that, I don't know, it was okay.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.080
It's good stripper music, I guess.

18:04.080 --> 18:07.080
Um, it should be Gold Faf.

18:07.080 --> 18:11.080
Um, I guess it'd be like 7'5".

18:11.080 --> 18:14.080
Alright, um, Jamie, how would you rate the bathroom?

18:14.080 --> 18:15.080
Or wherever you just were.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.080
I could hear the music from the bathroom, thank you.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.080
Alright, well, how would you like it?

18:19.080 --> 18:22.080
No, I'm kidding.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.080
It was...

18:23.080 --> 18:25.360
I actually liked what I heard of it.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.800
It was a little repetitive, but it gets an 8.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.640
That is totally fucking music.

18:31.640 --> 18:32.640
I give it a 9.

18:32.640 --> 18:35.840
Oh shit, I forgot kids listen to this show.

18:35.840 --> 18:36.840
My bad.

18:36.840 --> 18:40.920
Alright, song number 3 tonight comes from Cheater Loki.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.480
Cheater Cheater Cheater Loki.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.480
Hey, listen...

18:43.480 --> 18:45.640
Do not support Cheater Loki tonight.

18:45.640 --> 18:55.640
Listen, I did the same thing when Kingdom Hearts 1 came out, okay, so obviously my choice was going to be Utada Hikaru with Passion, because that is the team song.

18:55.640 --> 19:02.640
All right, here's song number three from Cheatin' Loki, Utada Hikaru with Passion. Enjoy.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.640
Oh

21:25.640 --> 21:28.640
I love you, don't you?

21:28.640 --> 21:34.640
But surely if I don't

21:34.640 --> 21:39.640
I'll carry on

21:39.640 --> 21:48.640
I'm not afraid of you

21:48.640 --> 21:53.640
I'm not afraid of you

22:53.640 --> 23:08.640
All the years in my life, I'll forever sleep at home

23:08.640 --> 23:19.960
Oh...

23:19.960 --> 23:22.840
I wish that...

23:26.360 --> 23:33.960
deserve

23:33.960 --> 23:47.160
Alright, song number three tonight, Utada Hikaru with Passion.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.960
Let's go around and see if everybody thought of that.

23:48.960 --> 23:49.960
Who started us off last time?

23:49.960 --> 23:50.960
Miku, talk.

23:50.960 --> 23:55.160
It was long and had bad camera angles, it's a one.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.160
Loki.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.640
I love that song.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.440
I love the guitar.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.440
That's the only thing I like remember of it each time, so...

24:04.440 --> 24:08.440
Yet you used the version without the guitar bridge in the middle, like in the opening video.

24:08.440 --> 24:11.440
You know what, I was pressed for time and I couldn't find the...

24:11.440 --> 24:14.440
Yeah, I had a feeling. I had a hunch.

24:15.440 --> 24:16.440
Dark Sakura.

24:16.440 --> 24:17.440
You didn't give a...

24:17.440 --> 24:18.440
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.440
I gave it a 9.

24:19.440 --> 24:20.440
Dark... Dark Sakura.

24:20.440 --> 24:24.280
I really like this song although as far as I thought that

24:25.760 --> 24:31.480
Hikaru was better as far as an opening song this

24:33.480 --> 24:40.060
You know I really like this song it's a problem, but I just don't like things about it, so it gets a seven

24:41.040 --> 24:44.880
I think the opening song to Kingdom Hearts 2 should have been easy breezy

24:45.200 --> 24:49.120
Because I think that would have been much better come on you could have like Sora skipping down

24:49.120 --> 24:51.620
It's not as dramatic.

24:51.620 --> 24:58.620
Alright, no, I like that song a lot, but it's already in rotation, so I give it a five.

24:58.620 --> 25:01.620
Alright, don't get me wrong, I love that song, but Loki sucks.

25:01.620 --> 25:05.620
Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

25:05.620 --> 25:10.620
Babyland with Jerry, song number one.

25:10.620 --> 25:26.780
Alright and song number two you can vote for tonight is Goldfrapp with Ooh La La is the

25:26.780 --> 25:36.500
name of that song.

25:36.500 --> 25:41.340
Alright and song number three you can vote for tonight is from Loki and it's Utada Hikaru

25:41.340 --> 25:42.340
with Passion.

25:42.340 --> 25:46.860
Alright you already know what that song sounds like.

25:46.860 --> 25:48.380
Alright place vote now.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.380
Someone's bitter.

25:49.380 --> 25:50.380
Send a private message.

25:50.380 --> 25:51.380
It's already in rotation, that's cheating.

25:51.380 --> 25:52.380
No one told me it was in rotation.

25:52.380 --> 25:53.380
We told you two weeks ago.

25:53.380 --> 25:54.380
Read the mod forum once in a while.

25:54.380 --> 25:55.380
Send a private message.

25:55.380 --> 26:06.420
We said it on the show and Rob said, here's some new songs that we just put into rotation

26:06.420 --> 26:09.460
and i'm playing them during the break and that was the first song he played

26:09.460 --> 26:13.920
i wasn't listening

26:14.500 --> 26:17.220
dark sakura has a memory like an elephant i mean besides that's an

26:17.220 --> 26:21.060
edit she don't forget she don't forget i yeah it's a slightly

26:21.060 --> 26:24.580
different version i think i i think so you don't forget what

26:24.580 --> 26:28.820
that that whole thing shut up yeah i think the one we have a

26:28.820 --> 26:32.020
rotation does have the guitar riff i think it's the one from the movie so

26:32.020 --> 26:40.980
it's the short one so all right and dude i'm gonna hit food maniac 64 with the trout now for being a

26:40.980 --> 26:46.980
butt all right do so because he told told everyone not to vote for my song so that play his but i

26:46.980 --> 26:51.220
haven't guaranteed that i'll play a song uh-huh yeah i told people i'd play their songs like

26:51.220 --> 26:55.540
three months ago and i still haven't just just keep just keep dangling out there four times

26:55.540 --> 26:57.540
Tell him to stop! Block him!

26:57.540 --> 26:59.540
Ahh!

26:59.540 --> 27:01.540
Alright.

27:01.540 --> 27:04.540
Uh, since I need some time here to tabulate votes, I need filler.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.540
So, we're gonna go around and do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

27:06.540 --> 27:08.540
Dark Sakura, How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

27:08.540 --> 27:10.540
Shitty! I mean, poopy.

27:10.540 --> 27:14.540
No, my week was actually pretty good. I've got more stuff to do.

27:14.540 --> 27:23.540
You know, my whole crappy work situation has improved to such a degree that I no longer feel like I'm going to kill people and then myself in a big emo fit.

27:23.540 --> 27:28.840
Instead, I just feel like, you know, I'm going to mildly maim people and, you know, not like actually kill them, you know.

27:29.760 --> 27:33.640
I'm no longer disgruntled. I'm slightly annoyed, but not disgruntled.

27:34.400 --> 27:41.320
So, um, I've also been playing a lot of Ragnarok online. I have, as of today, my

27:42.080 --> 27:44.960
primary character is 5441 and

27:46.160 --> 27:52.400
I still have to get job 50 before I can go assassin and I donated some money to their server

27:52.400 --> 27:56.400
So I got a bunch of free stuff for it, and I have a kitty band now and it makes me very happy bunny

28:00.920 --> 28:02.920
Yeah, I have a kitty band I

28:03.760 --> 28:08.540
Need to see pictures. I will send you pictures, and I got a bunch of cards, too

28:08.540 --> 28:11.600
I have a thief bug card and no like footwear that I can put it on

28:13.320 --> 28:15.320
And now I need a zombie card

28:17.200 --> 28:19.440
Because zombies are awesome like a hot dog

28:19.440 --> 28:23.440
Um, Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

28:23.440 --> 28:28.440
Um, my weekend day was okay. Um, gotta move my desk tomorrow, cause

28:28.440 --> 28:35.440
we do this thing every once in a while, once we fire a bunch of people, where we do, like, the floor layout shuffle.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.440
And we-

28:36.440 --> 28:37.440
Those are fun.

28:37.440 --> 28:46.440
Yeah, for no apparent reason. I mean, they'll even, they'll move people, like, one desk over, just for the hell of it.

28:46.440 --> 28:51.120
it, and it's kind of fun. But anyway, so I got to move my desk, and I get my review next

28:51.120 --> 28:55.920
week, which should be interesting because my phone time sucks, but I'm the smartest

28:55.920 --> 29:02.840
one there. So, you know, it kind of evens out. And I don't know. It'll be cool. We're

29:02.840 --> 29:06.920
supposed to be getting our bonuses. My coworker taught me this really cool thing with our

29:06.920 --> 29:11.140
bonus because they take out twice the amount of taxes as they normally would on your checks

29:11.140 --> 29:17.740
on bonus checks. So where I potentially could get $2,000, I only get like $1,100 or something.

29:17.740 --> 29:28.260
So what you do is you put out another W4 or whatever for exempt for that week. So I get

29:28.260 --> 29:36.020
my full $2,000, which is going to a laptop. And what else? Oh yeah, I got my spiffy camera,

29:36.020 --> 29:41.120
which you'll hopefully see some more content for the PSP site. That's one of the main reasons

29:41.120 --> 29:45.240
was for that, and that, so I can record some of my stuff at, you know, well I'm probably

29:45.240 --> 29:49.480
going to record stuff at my bachelor party, because what happens at bachelor party stays

29:49.480 --> 29:54.720
at bachelor party, and um, and also, um, do you know what they have planned for your bachelor

29:54.720 --> 30:01.280
party yet? Because I do. I don't. Okay. Um, I do. But that's all I can say. Okay. Anyways,

30:01.280 --> 30:06.360
um, the other thing is, um, just, you know, recording wedding stuff, um, just it's really

30:06.360 --> 30:09.440
fun to play with that camera, because it has a 20 gig hard drive in there, so you can like

30:09.440 --> 30:14.240
store tons of video. Lots of video coming from E3, that's for sure, so look

30:14.240 --> 30:20.520
forward to that in lots of pictures. And yeah, I think that's about all I have.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.400
Miguel Tov, how was your week?

30:23.400 --> 30:32.000
My week was boring. Work is boring. I'm sick of it. And then today, slash last night, got

30:32.000 --> 30:36.320
myself hyped up to go to Best Buy and wait in a non-existent line at 3 in the

30:36.320 --> 30:43.880
morning. That didn't go over so well. Best Buy sucks. And then tomorrow, somebody

30:43.880 --> 30:47.360
new that we hired is gonna be sitting in my office and I'm not looking forward to

30:47.360 --> 30:52.700
that because I hate new people and I will not talk to them. You're not a team

30:52.700 --> 30:58.220
player. I don't need to be a team player. They invaded my space. They can go away.

30:58.220 --> 31:02.220
And, uh, I, um...

31:02.220 --> 31:06.220
Oh! We started playing Tetris DS at work, and it's over already.

31:06.220 --> 31:10.220
Because a lot of people suck and whine too much like me.

31:10.220 --> 31:14.220
Back to apples and apples. Apples to apples is occasionally played. We recently discovered

31:14.220 --> 31:18.220
the joy of Team Mario Kart at break.

31:18.220 --> 31:22.220
That's really fun. Team Mario Kart? Yeah, and under versus, when you're setting up the options

31:22.220 --> 31:26.220
like 150 and computer difficulty if you have computers and all that, there's an option for team.

31:26.220 --> 31:32.100
and so you can actually do a four-on-four team and it's pretty much

31:32.100 --> 31:36.840
like a regular race except you have a color icon like red or blue and you can

31:36.840 --> 31:40.880
still attack your own teammates but how it works is it's an overall point total

31:40.880 --> 31:45.400
for your team. You're no longer working just to be the best you're working as a

31:45.400 --> 31:50.480
team so we started out last week when the losers were still playing Tetris me

31:50.480 --> 31:55.140
and the person in my room or in my office we played it with computers and

31:55.140 --> 31:59.060
he got screwed over twice with really bad computer players, but it's really fun, actually,

31:59.060 --> 32:04.020
and I didn't even think Mario Kart could be more fun than it already was.

32:04.020 --> 32:07.940
We're trying to find another game, because people are starting to get pissed off at my

32:07.940 --> 32:13.740
work with Grand Theft Auto Liberty Sea Stories because they're calling me, they're saying

32:13.740 --> 32:18.620
that I'm cheesing it up now because I used to just grab the mega damage icons or powerups

32:18.620 --> 32:20.940
and then go kick the crap out of everyone.

32:20.940 --> 32:24.940
So now we're playing without powerups because, you know, they got pissed off at that and

32:24.940 --> 32:29.500
because I won the rankings this month. So this next month now we're just trying to

32:29.500 --> 32:33.420
I want to do team games but the problem is we don't get enough people to

32:33.420 --> 32:38.620
participate. You can only do six and some people are gone or busy and stuff and

32:38.620 --> 32:42.380
that kind of makes it unfair but um I don't know we're looking forward to like

32:42.380 --> 32:45.780
maybe Liberty City Stories when it comes out in PlayStation 2. Hopefully I'll have

32:45.780 --> 32:49.980
multiplayer and then we you know land together some PS2s and play that way.

32:49.980 --> 32:52.980
Okay. I don't know. It might be fun.

32:52.980 --> 32:54.980
That could be fun.

32:54.980 --> 32:56.980
Rob, how was your weekend today?

32:56.980 --> 33:01.980
It was fine. Besides the whole male PMS thing, I was fine. I had a fine week.

33:01.980 --> 33:09.980
I went to the gym today and my trainer pretty much told me officially today that I'm fat, which was good to hear.

33:09.980 --> 33:13.980
I had to take the little machine that measures your body fat.

33:13.980 --> 33:15.980
And you hold it in your hands away from your body?

33:15.980 --> 33:17.980
Yeah, exactly. And it did the little boop, boop, boop thing.

33:17.980 --> 33:18.980
VMI scale.

33:18.980 --> 33:23.060
yep he looked at the number and then he turned it around said yep you're right

33:23.060 --> 33:27.900
here in the high one like thanks but oh well I mean I already knew that was

33:27.900 --> 33:30.660
coming anyway that's why you're going that's the whole reason I signed up for

33:30.660 --> 33:35.060
the gym so I just you know have to make sure I stuff low regularly but I that's

33:35.060 --> 33:37.380
pretty cool that you have a trainer though that'd be the only thing I'd

33:37.380 --> 33:40.740
be able to do you know well I only get him one more time for free then I'd have

33:40.740 --> 33:43.740
to pay for him if I like you both what come to my gym with me I'll work out

33:43.740 --> 33:46.780
with you and show you what to do that would be fun that'd be fun well I mean

33:46.780 --> 33:51.180
it's not that I don't know what to do, I just, you know, I need the motivation is a huge

33:51.180 --> 33:58.820
thing. Put a cupcake in front of you. I promise you, next Monday, nothing will stand in between

33:58.820 --> 34:04.780
us going to spin. Word. You know what, they do spin at this gym too. You have to go to

34:04.780 --> 34:09.900
my trainer's spin. She's vicious. I asked my trainer if you could come to this club

34:09.900 --> 34:13.920
and he said with a guest pass you can. So, you'll have to come to one of our classes

34:13.920 --> 34:19.000
sometimes if you enjoy it. Alright, bring me a guest pass. You got it! You're on! And

34:19.000 --> 34:22.200
we'll pick a class to do. We can do yoga. In the summer we can go swimming. We can do

34:22.200 --> 34:25.560
yoga or something. Because don't they have a lap pool there? They have two huge pools

34:25.560 --> 34:31.080
there. I got all the stuff to do lap swimming. Cool. They're outdoors though. I thought it

34:31.080 --> 34:35.280
was indoors when I signed up. Oh, one of the ones I have a membership for over here has

34:35.280 --> 34:40.240
a lap pool outside. It's the snooty one though. We need to do the indoor pool somewhere. I

34:40.240 --> 34:44.880
Roseville. I'm going to Roseville, my parents live right there. I think Roseville has three indoor

34:44.880 --> 34:49.920
pools. Anyway, oh hi, show! Shall we announce who won tonight's cage match?

34:49.920 --> 34:54.680
That'll be a good way to get close to the end here. Sure, the winner song of

34:54.680 --> 35:02.660
tonight's cage match was... a tie! And here are the two songs. Okay, you know how ties

35:02.660 --> 35:15.020
work. Here's song number one that tied. Baby Man. Here's song number two that tied. Passion,

35:15.020 --> 35:20.620
Utada Hikaru, and in the old Orange Lounge Radio rule book. I wonder where this is going.

35:20.620 --> 35:25.140
That means that when two songs tie, the host who got screwed over, oh that's me, gets to

35:25.140 --> 35:31.780
break the tie. Now see, I could be ironic and vote for your pick, Loki. And then Jamie

35:31.780 --> 35:37.940
could hate me all night that might be fun but no I can't do that because you

35:37.940 --> 35:41.900
know you you totally picked a song that was already in rotation so I think you

35:41.900 --> 35:46.640
both end up winning anyway so I am picking for Jamie's song I'm picking

35:46.640 --> 35:50.500
Jamie's song baby land because I like the fact that they sound like social

35:50.500 --> 35:59.340
service all right so two weeks in a row all right baby land for the win two

35:59.340 --> 36:01.340
weeks in a row, not too shabby.

36:01.340 --> 36:04.900
So everybody has to go to their show in Berkeley. Now the stripper song was only

36:04.900 --> 36:06.340
one vote behind.

36:06.340 --> 36:11.340
So it was close. We were all out there. We were all winners. It's a drop not as much of a winner's show.

36:11.340 --> 36:17.660
So it was one vote for Pat, that one song, one vote for Jamie's song, and zero votes for yours.

36:17.660 --> 36:19.480
Yeah, something like that.

36:19.480 --> 36:22.940
And that was both of our listeners right there. Sweet. Alright, it's about

36:22.940 --> 36:25.660
nine thirty and I think it's time to call it a night. What do you kids think?

36:25.660 --> 36:32.380
I want ice cream. I'm thirsty. I want, I'm hungry. I want a cupcake.

36:32.380 --> 36:35.840
I think there, no I think I ate the last one.

36:35.840 --> 36:40.300
Bastard! No, it's fine. I need, uh, ooh, I want boba.

36:40.300 --> 36:43.820
That's twenty-three maggots. I hear you there. Oh, you know, um,

36:43.820 --> 36:48.660
Tap-X is open. You, stop it! Stop it, all of you!

36:48.660 --> 36:53.140
No, no, John. I, Rob, I just got told by Fat today. I don't... Look at, look at you some

36:53.140 --> 36:59.260
nice wheat grass. I don't want wheat grass. I want bulimia right about now. Alright.

36:59.260 --> 37:09.140
Then fine I'll get you a bottle of Ipecac. Hooray. Ugh. Alright. And a toothbrush. That's

37:09.140 --> 37:15.100
disgusting. You said you wanted bulimia. Alright, sorry chat room I ignored your FUs tonight,

37:15.100 --> 37:18.820
maybe next week. Tonight was supposed to be a slow news night and we went on forever but

37:18.820 --> 37:21.580
of course I think that little giggle fit had something to do with it. Your giggle fit,

37:21.580 --> 37:22.080
OK, Rob.

37:22.080 --> 37:22.900
My giggle fit?

37:22.900 --> 37:23.660
You're a giggle fit.

37:23.660 --> 37:25.340
Yeah, you're the only one laughing in the microphone.

37:25.340 --> 37:26.340
We were laughing at you.

37:26.340 --> 37:28.420
I have your giggle fit on camera, so.

37:28.420 --> 37:29.220
All right, shut up.

37:29.220 --> 37:29.740
A partial.

37:29.740 --> 37:30.860
All right, here it is.

37:30.860 --> 37:32.100
Your fortune cookie message.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.500
I almost said your moment of zen.

37:33.500 --> 37:36.300
You still want to be a duck?

37:36.300 --> 37:38.020
Of the day, I don't want to be a duck.

37:38.020 --> 37:48.020
We're tiny, we're toonie, we're all a little loony, and in this cartoony we're invading your TV.

37:48.020 --> 37:54.020
We're comic dispensers, we crack up all of the censors, on Tiny Toon Adventures, get a dose of comedy.

37:54.020 --> 37:58.020
So here's that big, cause it's a whole wide world apart.

37:58.020 --> 38:01.020
Our hopes, we only stand alone, a cartoon worth a part.

38:01.020 --> 38:05.020
The scripts were rejected, expect the unexpected.

38:05.020 --> 38:08.020
Tiny Toon Adventures is about to start

38:08.020 --> 38:10.020
They're furry, they're funny

38:10.020 --> 38:11.020
They're fast and bust and bunny

38:11.020 --> 38:13.020
Munch and a match has money

38:13.020 --> 38:14.020
Amira is a pain

38:14.020 --> 38:16.020
She's hunting and plucking

38:16.020 --> 38:18.020
Dizzy, Devil, Yucky

38:18.020 --> 38:19.020
Her ball's a monkey

38:19.020 --> 38:21.020
And Go-Go isn't safe

38:21.020 --> 38:23.020
At Atfield University

38:23.020 --> 38:24.020
We earn our Toon degree

38:24.020 --> 38:28.020
The teaching staff been getting laughs since 1933

38:28.020 --> 38:29.020
We're tiny, we're tinny

38:29.020 --> 38:31.020
We're all a little loony

38:31.020 --> 38:34.520
It's fine, you tune in, just come and join the fun!

38:34.520 --> 38:36.520
And now our song is done!
