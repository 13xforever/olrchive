0	28000	Today is Wednesday, May 10th, 2006, and we're live at E3!
28000	39000	Good evening, everybody. We are live at the E3 Outpost in West Los Angeles.
39000	44000	So, the sound sounds a little bit different tonight. That's because we're recording live here at the Arena Interactive Lounge.
44000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Skye. Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
50000	50000	Hi.
50000	51000	How you doing?
51000	52000	Tired.
52000	53000	Yeah?
53000	56000	I'm excited and tired at the same time. It's a very bizarre feeling.
56000	58000	Say hello, as well, to Tech Master, Loki.
58000	59000	Hello.
59000	60000	How you doing, Loki?
60000	62000	I'm doing good.
62000	68000	All right. Also joining us tonight, we have some special guests, or a special guest, I should say. Say hello to Bobby.
68000	69000	Hey, guys.
69000	70000	Hey, Bobby.
70000	71000	This is a thrill for me.
71000	75000	It's about time we got you on our show. It just took E3 to finally get you here.
75000	76000	Yeah, exactly.
76000	81000	That's all right. All right. Also, we want to say a shout-out to Mr. Lawrence Young, who's manning the controls tonight.
81000	84000	We appreciate his help in making the show work.
84000	88000	All right. Let's get right into it. Let's not waste time. Let's talk about E3.
88000	93000	I thought what we could do, let's go down the line, talk about three interesting things we saw at E3 today.
93000	95000	Jamie, give us one.
95000	100000	I would have to say Zelda Twilight Princess. Getting to play that was pretty fun.
100000	103000	Now, did you play the Zelda Twilight Princess on the Wii, or the...
103000	104000	Wii.
104000	105000	The Wii.
105000	106000	I played on the Wii, and I went Wii.
106000	109000	Did Nintendo have a huge-ass line for the Wii today?
109000	113000	Not if you made it in there in the early... We got in there at the tail end of the early media hours.
113000	114000	Right.
114000	116000	So we just sort of... Once we got in line, it was pretty cool.
116000	122000	I did get to hear... I never remember his name. I know his name is Charles, the guy who's Mario's voice.
122000	123000	Oh, right, yeah.
123000	127000	Sing the Mario... The old Mario theme song from the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.
127000	128000	That's awesome.
128000	132000	The guys in front of us got him to... The guys from the Mushroom Kingdom got him to sing it.
132000	134000	So I have it on tape.
134000	135000	Sweet. That's awesome.
135000	136000	It was pretty fun.
136000	141000	So tell us about, how is Zelda on the Wii different from what we saw last year with the GameCube?
141000	145000	Well, first of all, I didn't get to see it on the GameCube, so I don't know.
145000	150000	I do know that it is widescreen, whereas the GameCube version is not.
150000	154000	Hurray, I'm so glad to hear there's widescreen support, because I was really worried about that with Wii.
154000	156000	Well, you're going to get 480p.
156000	157000	Good.
157000	159000	But probably nothing more than that.
159000	160000	All right.
160000	165000	Well, you know, it's something. At least my widescreen TV isn't going to go to total waste.
165000	167000	So that makes me happy.
167000	172000	All right, so that's one for Jamie. Loki, what would you say is one interesting thing you saw today?
172000	178000	My favorite... You know, it was really a toss-up on Sega's booth, because there's a few things I liked.
178000	183000	I did get to play my first PS3 game, which would be Full Auto 2.
183000	186000	And, of course, me being such a big Full Auto whore.
186000	188000	They had Full Auto 2 there? I totally missed it.
188000	189000	Yeah, they had Full Auto 2 there.
189000	196000	They were debuting basically all the deathmatch modes, which I said should have been in the first one, but no.
196000	203000	So, anyways, they had that, and we were basically playing a six-player deathmatch and stuff, and if you won, you get a hat.
203000	205000	But, of course, I don't wear a hat, so I didn't care.
205000	208000	But, overall, the controls are basically the same.
208000	213000	Horrible framerate problems, just like the first one.
213000	217000	I mean, we're talking dropping down a crawl.
217000	219000	But, then again, it's not finished either, so...
219000	221000	Do you think it's just an early build issue?
221000	227000	Well, you know, I'm not sure, because the fact the first one had really bad framerate problems, too.
227000	229000	So, you never know.
229000	231000	But, I'm sure it's not done.
231000	237000	I just want to remind folks, if you guys are hearing ambient noise in the background, that is because we're not at your usual studio.
237000	240000	We are at the Arena Interactive Lounge, where the E3 Outpost is taking place.
240000	243000	If you're in the LA area, this thing's going on all week.
243000	245000	Come on down. We're off Santa Monica Boulevard.
245000	247000	We'll be here Thursday and Friday, taping live as well.
247000	252000	Other folks are taping, too. Scott Rubin and Lawrence Young doing their show.
252000	256000	Gamer Andy's got his gig going on. Bobby Blackwolf, Friday night, of course.
256000	258000	So, it's just... You know what this place is?
258000	260000	I mean, there's like big, widescreen TVs everywhere.
260000	262000	It's like a big gamer frat house.
262000	264000	Seriously, what it's like. It's awesome.
264000	269000	It's cool. So, again, if we sound a little different out of our elements, it's because we are.
269000	271000	But, that's a good thing.
271000	274000	Anyway, I just wanted to give that a plug, because we are kind of using their equipment tonight.
274000	276000	So, we have to give them a big thank you.
276000	278000	We're also in their chat room because of it.
278000	281000	We're trying to keep an eye on it. It's a little harder, because we're not in our usual setup.
281000	283000	chat.allgames.com
283000	288000	And there's this wristband on my arm that says over 21, which means they have alcohol here.
288000	290000	That means you get to drink.
290000	292000	I got asked if I was over 21.
292000	294000	You always get carded.
294000	298000	No, we didn't get those. We'll get those later.
298000	301000	Oh, yeah. You're interesting.
301000	308000	Very interesting thing. I'm going to give a shout out to the Music Game fans, because I know we have a lot of Music Game fans that listen to the program and are dying to know.
308000	313000	So, let me talk about the Bamani setup at Konami's booth, which is very interesting.
313000	315000	They sort of have a round setup.
315000	317000	2DX distorted machine is there.
317000	319000	Guitar Freaks V2 is there.
319000	321000	Why? I have no idea.
321000	325000	Konami did not announce that Distorted is coming out for the home here.
325000	328000	They did not announce they're porting Guitar Freaks here in the US.
328000	331000	So they were just there to get butts in the booth, I guess.
331000	335000	I did get a chance to play each of the three new DDR home versions.
335000	337000	I did play around on Universe.
337000	340000	Universe looks a lot better than it does in the trailer, I'll tell you that.
340000	343000	Universe has a very disco funky feel to it.
343000	346000	The interface is a little crazy. The song select was kind of...
346000	349000	It's like a 3D wheel.
349000	350000	I liked it.
350000	351000	Yeah, I kind of liked it. I dug it.
351000	353000	And there are repeats from old mixes.
353000	358000	I noticed Jairus was in the demo, and there's other stuff too.
358000	362000	I'm sure DDR Freak of Bamani style have lists posted already on those games.
362000	364000	I actually really liked UltraMix 4.
364000	367000	I kind of thought UltraMix 4 had the better song list.
367000	370000	The interface is just kind of like an upside down UltraMix 2.
370000	372000	And there's really... I mean, it's another UltraMix.
372000	373000	But I thought it had a better song list.
373000	375000	It has Listen to Your Heart, it had BitMania.
375000	377000	I had a lot of fun playing that.
377000	380000	I tried playing doubles on Universe,
380000	383000	and unfortunately they had the pad set backwards.
383000	384000	So that didn't work.
384000	387000	Supernova is exactly what you'd expect.
387000	390000	And of course they have two Supernova machines, the home version.
390000	392000	But, Jamie, did you play DDR Supernova home version?
392000	393000	No.
393000	394000	David Bowie's in it.
394000	395000	Let's dance.
395000	396000	Oh yeah, I knew that.
396000	397000	That's awesome.
397000	400000	And then of course, not just David Bowie, Kelly Clarkson,
400000	402000	if you're into American Idol since you've been gone.
402000	405000	Now that's kind of weird to me because I don't think that's in the arcade.
405000	408000	So it looks like there is going to be a little bit of diversity
408000	410000	between the home mix and the arcade mix.
410000	412000	I've got to admit, I'm getting to the point, guys,
412000	415000	where DDR, especially these demos,
415000	420000	my thrill on DDR is the extra modes and the extra things that are in it,
420000	422000	and they're not in these builds right now.
422000	424000	I was just glad they had freaking arcade cabinets there
424000	426000	because I hate playing on those goddamn soft pads.
426000	428000	Did you notice that they have the soft pads?
428000	431000	It's like literally saran wrap to the floor.
431000	433000	At least it's not duct tape.
433000	436000	What did you think of the Universe 360 pads?
436000	437000	They're just like soft pads.
437000	443000	I get lost on them again because, you know, I don't know.
443000	446000	I'm actually going to go play Karaoke Revolution Country Edition tomorrow.
446000	448000	All right, I'm going to our chat room.
448000	451000	Remember we're temporarily tonight in chat.allgames.com.
451000	454000	We'll be there all week long because we love allgames.com.
454000	455000	Let's see.
455000	457000	Weiland wants to know, wait, Bowie isn't what?
457000	462000	David Bowie's Let's Dance is going to be a danceable song in DDR Super Nova.
462000	464000	Guys, guys.
464000	469000	Okay, and then also going to the chat room there, let's see.
469000	473000	Sephiroth1215, one of our fans, says, I hate Kelly.
473000	476000	Well, you know, a lot of people do, but a lot of people like her, you know.
476000	482000	Speaking of Kelly, it seems that they've dropped the Karaoke Revolution title from American Idol,
482000	484000	if you notice that, on the trailer.
484000	486000	Oh, no, I didn't notice.
486000	491000	Well, first off, the game's not even to a point where they can show it at E3,
491000	493000	which is why we have Country here.
493000	495000	But they dropped the title.
495000	500000	All they really had for the video was just, you know, the intro that you see normally on American Idol.
500000	501000	It just says, coming in the winter.
501000	502000	Weird.
502000	504000	All right.
504000	507000	Bobby, do you have an interesting thing you want to share with us?
507000	512000	Well, unfortunately, I didn't get to play all that much today just because, you know, getting in late
512000	515000	and, you know, just walking around and making sure I saw everything.
515000	520000	Other than, you know, the utterly disappointing Square Theater,
520000	525000	which is usually a wonderful production with, like, great production values, lights everywhere,
525000	526000	you know, everything's, like, synchronized.
526000	529000	This time it was just a digital projection.
529000	533000	I did get to play Guitar Man Lives for the PSP.
533000	535000	And you're sitting there, you're smiling and nodding.
535000	536000	I wouldn't.
536000	542000	It is a straight port of the PlayStation 2, same music, same note patterns and everything.
542000	545000	The only thing that has changed is now if you pause it, you can continue.
545000	547000	You don't have to start over.
547000	549000	Actually, you also have a duet mode.
549000	551000	Do that? Because they didn't show that.
551000	555000	You play as Kira, who was the, I guess, the girl in the game.
555000	558000	You can do duet mode with her, and there's a versus mode.
558000	559000	Okay.
559000	561000	There was a versus mode in the PS2 version, though.
561000	567000	It was showing it off like it was some sort of new thing, but the duet mode I know is new.
567000	568000	Okay.
568000	569000	Interesting.
569000	571000	But it's still all the same songs?
571000	572000	That is a bit of a letdown.
572000	577000	I was hoping for some new Guitar Man, but I guess some people will be excited to see that it's on the go.
577000	578000	Yeah.
578000	579000	Okay, whatever.
579000	582000	I wanted to go back to this Square Enix trailer.
582000	587000	You know, I feel horrible saying this because I thought Square had some of the nicest staff that I dealt with all day.
587000	590000	They had really great staff, and they were nice.
590000	596000	But the trailer presentation was a letdown because a lot of what they were showing was stuff that's already out.
596000	598000	Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.
598000	603000	Although, it is something else to see it on the digital projection and all its high-def glory.
603000	604000	That was kind of neat.
604000	607000	Final Fantasy XIII looks sexy as hell.
607000	611000	Only three seconds of gameplay to see, though, but it did look sexy.
611000	616000	There was some in-game footage, but it was like the cinematic footage using the game engine.
616000	619000	I could tell because there were still jaggies, and it's the PlayStation 3.
619000	620000	Yeah.
620000	621000	Didn't they learn?
621000	622000	We'll see, we'll see.
622000	629000	I mean, again, these trailers, it's the same reason why I'm not screaming and hollering about Halo 3 yet.
629000	633000	It's a trailer that didn't show us much of the actual game itself, you know what I mean?
633000	638000	Let's wait until I can actually get my hand on the controller, play it, try it out.
638000	642000	You know what, the square thing will give the fans what they want, so whatever.
642000	644000	They'll have a good time with that.
644000	647000	Jamie, number two, a second interesting thing you saw today.
647000	649000	Guitar Hero 2.
649000	650000	Ah, how was that?
650000	652000	It was fun.
652000	658000	Basically, it brought in the two that actually, it really added in something else that I wouldn't have mind seeing.
658000	662000	I wanted bass mode in the first one, and this gives me bass mode.
662000	668000	Instead of having versus play, you have cooperative play, which is how I think it should be anyway if, you know, you've got a band on stage.
668000	673000	You know, if one person sucks, the whole band's got to pretty much blow it.
673000	679000	But the way it works now is that Player 1 is lead guitar, Player 2, depending on song, is either bass or rhythm.
679000	686000	And they're even bringing in the very newest models for their available guitars, the newest Gibson guitars available.
686000	691000	I'm still going to have the Flying V, they brought in the Thunderbirds, Thunderbird now.
691000	695000	We still have the, you know, Les Paul, the SGs.
695000	701000	And there's still hidden characters in it, new unlockable content.
701000	705000	I played YYZ, that was like cool.
705000	707000	That was really awesome.
707000	713000	So, I mean, are there enough differences from the first game to make this, you know, worthwhile?
713000	716000	I didn't see enough to really make a judgment like that yet.
716000	721000	But, you know, just having new songs to play is great.
721000	726000	You know, if it were me, I would have been, I mean, I know it is on PlayStation 2,
726000	731000	but I would think that they'd want to jump to Xbox and have downloadable content.
731000	733000	That would be a smart way to go.
733000	736000	But as it is now, I think it's going to be pretty good.
736000	740000	And they actually had those nice lovely red controllers that were really nice.
740000	743000	All right, let's go to the chat room and see some comments there.
743000	748000	Chantaz over in chat.allgames.com says, Halo 3 teaser ripped off System Shock.
748000	751000	So, not a person who wasn't a big fan of the Halo 3,
751000	755000	or maybe he was a fan of the Halo 3 teaser, but just felt it ripped off another one.
755000	760000	Funnydale says, it's sad, Square is turning Final Fantasy into the new Madden.
760000	761000	I kind of agree with that.
761000	763000	They need to get off Final Fantasy VII.
763000	764000	They are killing it.
764000	767000	Final Fantasy VII football, I bet, will be next year's announcement.
767000	769000	What do you think?
769000	773000	It looks like some folks in the chat room are getting buffered tonight.
773000	777000	Guys, I'm sure we're getting bombarded with people tonight, which is amazing.
777000	778000	Thank you guys for supporting the show.
778000	781000	Don't forget it will be on our podcast stream a little later.
781000	784000	Let's see.
784000	788000	Somebody had said something about Guitar Man.
788000	791000	I want to say it was Xander here.
791000	797000	Xander C says, I restarted at least three times accidentally on the original Guitar Man because I couldn't pause.
797000	798000	So, that new feature will come in handy.
798000	803000	Xander also says, Final Fantasy Versus XIII is being made by the Kingdom Hearts II team.
803000	804000	That's correct.
804000	805000	That is correct.
805000	806000	It's a joint production.
806000	807000	Yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy.
807000	808000	But here's the thing, dude.
808000	810000	That's all we know about Final Fantasy Versus XIII.
810000	812000	The trailer didn't tell a shit.
812000	819000	It tells you that there's a main male character who has psychic Miss Cleo gone way wrong abilities and that's about it.
819000	820000	Alright, anyway.
820000	822000	Girl with gun blades.
822000	824000	In the original Final Fantasy XIII, yes.
824000	825000	Yeah.
825000	829000	And then there's a Final Fantasy XIII mobile, but I'm not even going to go there because I'll cry.
829000	830000	Blah, blah, blah.
830000	831000	Final Fantasy.
831000	832000	Loki.
832000	833000	Something interesting.
833000	835000	Well, let's see here.
835000	838000	I did, of course, also play the Wii.
838000	840000	I got to play Red Steel.
840000	843000	And that was okay, actually.
843000	844000	I don't know.
844000	845000	I'm still kind of...
845000	847000	It's the first time I've played it.
847000	850000	And I thought that the controls were way too sensitive.
850000	855000	Like, it was very awkward playing it and it did not feel natural.
855000	867000	And if I were a very judgmental mom buying this for my kids, I would probably be turned away by it if it's going to stay like this.
867000	877000	Because it wasn't easy, but there were other games that were also being shown, like WarioWare, which was really awesome.
877000	880000	I mean, just what they're doing with the controller is amazing.
880000	883000	What you would expect from a WarioWare game.
883000	887000	Overall, the Wii stuff, I did play Red Steel.
887000	893000	I played a WarioWare and this kind of like obstacle course tech demo thing.
893000	897000	And each one very sensitive as far as the control scheme.
897000	901000	Now, Loki and Dark Sakura, I didn't spend a lot of time in Nintendo's booth today.
901000	902000	It was so crowded.
902000	903000	I hate their layout this year.
903000	905000	I think the layout is ass.
905000	907000	It's like a claustrophobic nightmare.
907000	911000	I'm sorry Nintendo, but having that huge dome in the middle with the...
911000	912000	That you can't get into.
912000	913000	Horrible idea.
913000	918000	But tell us about, because a lot of folks listening aren't going to E3, how is Nintendo's booth set up?
918000	921000	How did you guys get in there? What happens when you get in there?
921000	925000	Well, you're around basically the surrounding wall when you're in line and you go in.
925000	928000	And it's like a spiral.
928000	929000	They have these talking walls.
929000	933000	They're like walls of pictures of people sitting in white rooms or whatever.
933000	937000	But they actually have a camera and can talk to you and they have the voice of Mario there.
937000	940000	Yeah, that's how we got to hear him sing.
940000	945000	But it was funny though, because I was like, well, why do they have people mocking me in line as I'm waiting?
945000	948000	But I don't know, it was interesting, a little bit different.
948000	950000	I don't know what the point was, but...
950000	955000	There was one of those guys that was very knowledgeable and kept giving a lot of really good information.
955000	961000	So it was sort of like having a rep there to talk with you while you're in line to sort of hype you up to go see it.
961000	971000	But once you got in, you circled around and went on this raised platform with sort of half of it covered in a picture on one side and the other side.
971000	977000	And then there were three in the middle, three widescreen TVs and different people were playing different games.
977000	981000	There's another one on the wall, but that was sort of for when they did the drum demo.
981000	982000	Yeah.
982000	988000	But when we went through there, Koji Kondo was playing the orchestra game and I got his autograph.
988000	989000	Sweet!
989000	990000	That made me very, very happy.
990000	992000	Was that orchestra three thing actually a game or just a demo?
992000	993000	It's a game.
993000	994000	It's demo.
994000	996000	No, I thought they said it was gonna...
996000	998000	It's a tech demo.
998000	1001000	Well, I guess we will see.
1001000	1002000	Alright.
1002000	1005000	Ah, shut up.
1005000	1007000	If I wanted your opinion, I'd turn your mic on.
1007000	1018000	Because they had a series of demo games playable and they were bringing out different ones as though they were going to be released later on as packaged items.
1018000	1020000	At least as far as I was led to believe.
1020000	1027000	Well, looking at what they were talking about yesterday during the press conference is that they have this Wii Sports thing.
1027000	1031000	And it actually looks like a collection of a bunch of small games.
1031000	1037000	Almost like, remember the first Nintendo system where they had it packaged with Mario and Duck Hunt.
1037000	1043000	They would have a bunch of like small tech demo things that kind of almost orient you to this new control scheme.
1043000	1052000	So they have the baseball, golf, tennis and a pilot wings type of game which is very kind of different.
1052000	1057000	Bobby, a second interesting thing you saw today.
1057000	1061000	Blink, blink, blink, blink.
1061000	1066000	The sensitive controls of Sonic the Hedgehog on the PS3.
1066000	1067000	Wasn't that weird?
1067000	1068000	It made me cry.
1068000	1072000	I was not a fan of Sonic on PS3, I have to admit.
1072000	1076000	Do you know how many times I fell off the edge?
1076000	1077000	Yeah, I watched.
1077000	1080000	It had so much potential to be good.
1080000	1085000	And I can see Jamie getting motion sickness from that just because of the way it was jumping around.
1085000	1087000	I left it with a headache.
1087000	1091000	I mean I felt nauseous and had a headache and on top of that my heart was broken.
1091000	1094000	So thank you Sony.
1094000	1097000	Well do you think the Xbox version will be just as bad?
1097000	1099000	That's in the Sega booth, we'll have to check.
1099000	1100000	Yeah, we'll have to look tomorrow.
1100000	1103000	I'm going to find out and if it isn't I'll blame Sega and I'll go cry there.
1103000	1106000	I played the one in the Sega booth and the controls.
1106000	1110000	The camera kind of was pissing me off and I couldn't figure out how to play.
1110000	1112000	I was playing the Silver Sonic one.
1112000	1115000	They had two different levels once as Sonic wins.
1115000	1122000	Silver Sonic being like super duper super science Sonic with psycho kinetic powers and crap.
1122000	1123000	So I don't know.
1123000	1126000	Now one of the things I do want to mention about the PS3 controller.
1126000	1130000	Because we got to actually see it and play it that a lot of people don't realize.
1130000	1133000	Because you've never really seen a good look of it.
1133000	1136000	And yes the PlayStation circle button in the middle is touchable.
1136000	1138000	It didn't do anything in what we had.
1138000	1142000	But the L2 and the R2 buttons are now like the triggers on the Xbox.
1142000	1144000	They're not straight buttons.
1144000	1147000	They are actually analog triggers.
1147000	1150000	I thought that was kind of interesting.
1150000	1151000	I missed my number two.
1151000	1154000	My number two thing I thought was interesting today would be Luminous Live.
1154000	1158000	It's way back in the corner of the very crowded Microsoft booth.
1158000	1163000	But oh my God it's just Luminous on the TV.
1163000	1165000	That's all I wanted.
1165000	1166000	It's great.
1166000	1171000	I mean if this is only going to be five bucks I'm betting it will probably be 800 points not 400.
1171000	1176000	But even then Luminous is such a great game.
1176000	1177000	That was such a surprise to me.
1177000	1180000	I could not believe that that came over on Xbox.
1180000	1181000	That's going to be great.
1181000	1182000	I'm so excited about it.
1182000	1185000	But yeah for those of you guys that are wondering about Luminous Live.
1185000	1188000	It's pretty much just Luminous on the Xbox.
1188000	1189000	Pretty hot.
1189000	1190000	I liked it.
1190000	1191000	Music videos in the background.
1191000	1193000	Dave you other guys go to Microsoft's booth today?
1193000	1197000	It's not like you guys spend most of your day in West Hall whereas Bobby and I are mostly in South Hall today.
1197000	1202000	I saw Viva Pinata the demo the presentation of Viva Pinata in there.
1202000	1209000	And it's like let's see Animal Crossing meets Harvest Moon meets Spore meets some other stuff probably.
1209000	1211000	It's kind of the way it looked.
1211000	1213000	I still don't know really what it is.
1213000	1215000	Remind me to look for Spore tomorrow.
1215000	1217000	It's all in EA's stuff.
1217000	1219000	We've totally missed EA today.
1219000	1221000	We'll definitely have more tomorrow.
1221000	1226000	Did they say they were going to have a new what was it Midnight Club game?
1226000	1228000	Or not Midnight Club Need for Speed game.
1228000	1231000	I was looking for that today but I didn't see it at all.
1231000	1235000	Was it Need for Speed Carbon I think?
1235000	1236000	I don't know.
1236000	1238000	Alright one more interesting thing you saw today.
1238000	1240000	Dark Sakura.
1240000	1242000	I know you're typing in chat right now.
1242000	1244000	Oh you're arguing with somebody about graphics versus gameplay?
1244000	1246000	That pisses me off so much.
1246000	1247000	Alright.
1247000	1250000	What I just said is I don't want a pretty game that plays like crap.
1250000	1251000	Alright.
1251000	1252000	Okay.
1252000	1254000	Assistant is only as good as the games that are on it?
1254000	1255000	Yes?
1255000	1256000	Exactly.
1256000	1260000	I said that to a Sony rep today and he just sort of blinked at me.
1260000	1261000	It was funny.
1261000	1263000	Why does that not surprise me?
1263000	1267000	No he blinked and he thought about it because you know you're right.
1267000	1268000	Alright.
1268000	1273640	Anyway my number one and actually my list has been about equal but I have to say Sonic
1273640	1275000	Rivals on PSP.
1275000	1276000	Yeah?
1276000	1277000	I loved it.
1277000	1278000	Oh my god.
1278000	1282000	It was like everything that I loved about Sonic with racing shadow.
1282000	1286000	And it was like playing a 2D Sonic but 3D.
1286000	1291000	It was just fast and great and I just had the most fun and then they gave me a t-shirt
1291000	1293000	that I can't wear.
1293000	1294000	It's like three sizes too big.
1294000	1295000	Well that's cool though.
1295000	1297000	Does Sega have a theater this year?
1297000	1299000	I didn't see I don't think so.
1299000	1303000	I'm going to explore Sega in more detail tomorrow.
1303000	1309000	But I was just like it's a really good Sonic game on PSP.
1309000	1312000	I mean there's only one level I got to play but if the whole thing is like that I'm all
1312000	1313000	over that.
1313000	1314000	Yeah.
1314000	1318000	I mean it's just all the fast fun stuff I liked about Sonic and I didn't get to see
1318000	1324000	too much more than just what they had on demo but I'm hoping that there's a multiplayer
1324000	1328000	player race because you have first place, second place I would assume you can do more
1328000	1329000	characters.
1329000	1333000	I mean these sort of Sonic are just on a side scrolling level.
1333000	1335000	I think it's pretty cool.
1335000	1336000	Loki.
1336000	1339000	I played what was it?
1339000	1340000	Oh.
1340000	1343000	I'm trying such a play.
1343000	1345000	Dead Rising.
1345000	1348000	That game is Mr. Young.
1348000	1349000	Really fun.
1349000	1355000	You just you basically put them all you know put in the Dawn of Dead scenario with you
1355000	1356000	can do anything.
1356000	1359000	I was picking up pots smashing the people.
1359000	1362000	I you know ate a pie.
1362000	1368000	I was playing around with the Servbot mass and stuck one on you know zombie and smashed
1368000	1369000	it with a sledgehammer.
1369000	1375000	I mean that game is going to be endless hours of fun for me.
1375000	1378000	It's so gory but really fun.
1378000	1382000	I'm definitely getting it when it comes out.
1382000	1383000	Awesome.
1383000	1385000	Bobby you got one more?
1385000	1389000	Well I mean it's not as interesting as like what everybody else played because like I
1389000	1393000	said I didn't get to play the Wii which is what I would be talking about but we actually
1393000	1395000	looked at the new Dot Hack game.
1395000	1397000	I was actually thinking about that.
1397000	1400000	Yeah the Dot Hack it's what GU or something like that.
1400000	1401000	I don't remember what it was.
1401000	1403000	It's like Rebirth or something.
1403000	1407000	Right and but it looks like it's going to be another episodic you know and they don't
1407000	1410000	know the guy that I talked to didn't know what price it was going to be or anything
1410000	1413000	but it looked like more of the same.
1413000	1418000	Now it did have a lot more like animations and stuff and I actually got like the typical
1418000	1422000	anime where it shows the three main characters in like a split screen view for half a second
1422000	1427000	then they all go crazy and everything goes red but the demo I wish it was longer because
1427000	1428000	I really didn't get it.
1428000	1431000	Yeah that was my biggest problem with the Dot Hack demo is it wasn't long enough and
1431000	1435000	you pretty much fought the same monster although I thought getting on the bike was cool.
1435000	1436000	Yeah you can ride around on a bike.
1436000	1440000	Dot Hack is kind of a fan service thing anyway you know.
1440000	1444000	How are you going to be disappointed in Dot Hack this Dot Hack game if you're a Dot Hack
1444000	1445000	anime fan.
1445000	1448000	But you know if you like the first it feels like just like the first games with a little
1448000	1454000	more like the super combos and stuff that I missed in the first series of games.
1454000	1456000	Gosh what should I do for my last interesting thing.
1456000	1459000	I'm going to say Phantasy Star Universe.
1459000	1465000	Phantasy Star Universe I got to play it on PC which looked superior to the PS2 one I
1465000	1466000	saw.
1466000	1472000	It's it's it's great because they didn't change a lot of the Phantasy Star online formula.
1472000	1478000	They just made it a little better that you can do a little more super attacks like it
1478000	1482000	looked like he had some more like tactical points kind of thing that you can only do
1482000	1484000	so many power hits in a row.
1484000	1488000	So you can't just keep pouring those power hits but you can actually like get in a fourth
1488000	1489000	hit.
1489000	1492000	I think Phantasy Star Universe is going to be if you guys are on Phantasy Star online
1492000	1494000	it's going to be great for you guys.
1494000	1497000	Unfortunately the only disappointment I have with that is that there weren't they weren't
1497000	1499000	showing the 360 version.
1499000	1501000	So that kind of made me a little sad.
1501000	1502000	All right.
1502000	1505000	So I guess we all got our interesting things out.
1505000	1506000	I got a wacky question.
1506000	1508000	Can we can we take calls.
1508000	1509000	Yes you can.
1509000	1510000	We do calls.
1510000	1511000	Yes.
1511000	1512000	Give out the number Bobby.
1512000	1513000	OK.
1513000	1514000	Well you can either do we have both Skype and the toll free number.
1514000	1515000	OK.
1515000	1517000	Give out the toll free number because you don't want to have to have all those people
1517000	1518000	on Skype.
1518000	1519000	OK.
1519000	1524000	So the toll free number is 1 8 6 6 8 8 0 0 1 5 6.
1524000	1526000	That's a toll free number here in the United States.
1526000	1527000	Go ahead put that in chat.
1527000	1530000	Lawrence one call at a time though because when we get like two people on the line I
1530000	1531000	get crazy.
1531000	1532000	So.
1532000	1533000	All right.
1533000	1536000	Real quick though before we while we're waiting for some calls.
1536000	1537000	Booth babes.
1537000	1538000	Big controversy.
1538000	1541000	And there really weren't a whole lot on the show for this year.
1541000	1544000	I saw some in the Final Fantasy and I remember I turned to you and I'm like five thousand
1544000	1545000	dollars.
1545000	1547000	Well they were Mithra girls though.
1547000	1549000	There were more cosplayers than booth babes.
1549000	1550000	Yeah.
1550000	1551000	What do you think.
1551000	1552000	Is the show different without booth babes.
1552000	1553000	I didn't notice they weren't there.
1553000	1556000	I didn't notice nor did I miss nor did I care.
1556000	1557000	I did.
1557000	1562000	You know I didn't really notice either and I hope I don't come off sounding like the
1562000	1566000	token gay guy in the show saying that but I just.
1566000	1571000	I really didn't change the show because the show is about the games not about that scenery
1571000	1574000	and people were going in to see the games anyway.
1574000	1575000	What was that.
1575000	1578000	Somebody had come up with a creative substitute for the booth babes anyway.
1578000	1580000	What are you guys talking about in the bus.
1580000	1582000	We were talking about the Transformers.
1582000	1583000	I don't know if that was more.
1583000	1584000	Yeah.
1584000	1585000	Yeah.
1585000	1587000	There was there was there's an Optimus Prime in one of the booths and there's no Transformers
1587000	1589000	game in there but it got him in the booth.
1589000	1592000	There was a banner for the Transformers movie.
1592000	1594000	Oh is that what it was.
1594000	1595000	Yeah.
1595000	1596000	Savages.
1596000	1597000	Savages.
1597000	1598000	A bunch of savages.
1598000	1600000	Where's my game.
1600000	1601000	All right.
1601000	1604000	They did a Transformers game and it wasn't very good.
1604000	1607000	They've done several.
1607000	1609000	PlayStation 3.
1609000	1610000	Did.
1610000	1611000	Did your.
1611000	1613000	It sounds like we all got to play PlayStation 3 today.
1613000	1614000	Yeah.
1614000	1618000	Did your impressions of the PlayStation 3 go up from the Sony conference.
1618000	1619000	Were you disappointed.
1619000	1621000	What did you think.
1621000	1632000	I also played Gran Turismo HD and it was like another Gran Turismo and it was pretty but
1632000	1640000	honestly I I also saw that Heavenly Blade my my opinion is still remains the same Sony
1640000	1642000	shot themselves actually Heavenly Sword Heavenly Sword.
1642000	1643000	All right.
1643000	1644000	All right.
1644000	1649000	I'm thinking Dancing Blade which is another PlayStation game.
1649000	1653000	I still think that they've shot themselves in the foot.
1653000	1658000	And this time with having not the best of games to show for it.
1658000	1660000	We have a caller on the line.
1660000	1661000	OK.
1661000	1663000	I thought then I'll say hello to the car.
1663000	1664000	It was crap then.
1664000	1665000	Crap now.
1665000	1666000	All right.
1666000	1667000	Hi.
1667000	1669000	You're on Orange Lounge Radio live at the E3 Outpost.
1669000	1670000	Who's this.
1670000	1672000	It's the Ichiban Crush.
1672000	1677000	The Ichiban Crush one of my very favorite posters on the forums.
1677000	1679000	What's on your mind buddy.
1679000	1680000	Yeah.
1680000	1689000	So I'm looking at the E3 news on Monday and see the price announcement for PS3.
1689000	1696000	I can't help to wonder myself man but I mean I know this is Blu-ray and you're not going
1696000	1702000	to hear you just cannot get any cheaper than that but this thing really going to sell you.
1702000	1708000	Here's my thing with PlayStation 3 Sony has really yet to explain why their console is
1708000	1712000	worth 200 more bucks than Xbox 360.
1712000	1716000	And in playing the demos today I mean for instance Sonic Sonic is a game that's on Xbox
1716000	1717000	360.
1717000	1720000	Why do I need to invest the extra money in the PlayStation 3.
1720000	1726000	However to PlayStation 3's credits they do have a grip on some of the real great franchises
1726000	1732000	that Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer is you know fanboy boner inducing Final Fantasy 13.
1732000	1735000	I mean you know I'm a big Final Fantasy fan so of course.
1735000	1736000	Oh yeah.
1736000	1737000	Oh God.
1737000	1744000	And you know they've got games that I think are going to cater to the fanboys you know
1744000	1750000	but they're still for the average gamer Microsoft's in a great position right now because their
1750000	1756000	system is cheaper and it's at a glance right now seems to do the same thing as PlayStation
1756000	1757000	3.
1757000	1762000	What was missing from that conference for me was that Sony didn't tell me why I needed
1762000	1763000	Blu-ray.
1763000	1765000	Does anybody else have thoughts on that.
1765000	1769000	Well I don't know I've actually played Final Fantasy 12 and if that's any indication what
1769000	1772000	Final Fantasy 13 is going to be then I'm better off without it.
1772000	1775000	I like I love Final Fantasy 12 a whole lot.
1775000	1778000	Final Fantasy 12 had the single worst combat system ever.
1778000	1782000	It took the stuff that was good about grandia and made it crap.
1782000	1784000	We agree to disagree there I suppose.
1784000	1787000	Like what was with that whole line business.
1787000	1790000	Zander C and Chad don't like Microsoft.
1790000	1795000	Zander C says Microsoft has yet to show why their console is worth more than 150 dollars.
1795000	1802000	I the stuff they're doing with arcade and Gears of War this is incredible.
1802000	1805000	I'm I guys I know how you feel.
1805000	1810000	If you had told me four years ago I would be here saying positive things about Microsoft.
1810000	1812000	I would have said you're full of shit.
1812000	1814000	You know we lost planet right now.
1814000	1816000	This is lost planet that looks really good.
1816000	1821000	This is one reason why this console is over you know worth the money that it is I mean
1821000	1822000	lost planet right here.
1822000	1830000	One Capcom really has you know a level mind when it comes to the games that they're putting out in the 360.
1830000	1832000	They are truly next gen.
1832000	1836000	I mean Dead Rising and Lost Planet just two of the finest games on the 360.
1836000	1838000	They're coming out this year.
1838000	1840000	All right.
1840000	1845000	It's Yvonne crush anything else on your mind any other questions for us.
1845000	1848000	I'll be honest with you.
1848000	1856000	I'm really really worried about this upcoming this whole upcoming next gen just mainly because of Sony.
1856000	1863000	I don't think it's going to cause another crash like everyone's been saying for the past two decades.
1863000	1867000	But I don't know I'm just not feeling it this time around.
1867000	1872000	Not the way I was with the 16 bit 32 bit era.
1872000	1877000	You know it's it's a different battle this time because the battle is not just about the games.
1877000	1883000	But it's about getting that console in your living room so you can get the music and the on demand movies and all this other stuff.
1883000	1886000	That's a factor that we've never had to really deal with before.
1886000	1889000	So I think that's kind of what makes a lot of this very interesting.
1889000	1891000	So but yeah you're right.
1891000	1895000	It's this one is too hard to tell because look at Japan.
1895000	1899000	You know Xbox has really yet to catch on there is.
1899000	1902000	Is it going to catch wildfire after E3.
1902000	1904000	I don't know it's hard for me to say.
1904000	1911000	You know it could be very I think what would be most interesting about this is if Microsoft ends up on top here in the US.
1911000	1915000	Again I'm purely speculating guys please don't take this as my opinion on what's going to happen or whatever.
1915000	1919000	But what if Microsoft's on top here in the US and then Sony's on top in Japan.
1919000	1921000	Wouldn't that be something.
1921000	1925000	That means that we're still going to get another crappy PlayStation later on.
1925000	1929000	I hope I hope Sony's taking the feedback.
1929000	1934000	You know it seems like they did it before when everybody bitched about the boomerang controller.
1934000	1935000	They went back and changed it.
1935000	1937000	So hopefully Sony's listen this time.
1937000	1938000	Who knows.
1938000	1940000	The boomerang just looks uncomfortable.
1940000	1941000	All right.
1941000	1944000	It's about the controller like the boomerang.
1944000	1946000	It's not good.
1946000	1947000	It's my crush.
1947000	1949000	You know I love you but I got to let you go so we can get more.
1949000	1950000	All right.
1950000	1951000	Absolutely.
1951000	1952000	Thanks guys.
1952000	1953000	Thanks for calling.
1953000	1954000	I'm going.
1954000	1955000	All right.
1955000	1956000	You too.
1956000	1960000	One of the things I did before he called was about you were talking about Gran Turismo.
1960000	1963000	And a lot of people probably looked at the demo and they're like oh that's so cool the people move.
1963000	1967000	Well I'm going to tell you right now they are still 2D paper people.
1967000	1975000	I looked and you know the people because that's one of the things a lot of people have about the Gran Turismo series is that the people look like they're like 2D pieces of paper.
1975000	1978000	And they still are in that early demo.
1978000	1979000	Listen.
1979000	1981000	I played the Tokyo track and it.
1981000	1982000	I'm going to.
1982000	1984000	We're going to go to another call guys.
1984000	1986000	This is Nintendo Orange Launch Radio live at E3 Outpost.
1986000	1987000	Who's this?
1987000	1988000	Hello.
1988000	1992000	This is Nintendo Maniac 64 or Bad Starter Maniac 64.
1992000	1994000	Hi Nintendo Maniac 64.
1994000	1995000	How are you doing?
1995000	2001000	I'm static over the whole freeze thing because I'm all the way in the east coast.
2001000	2005000	You're static about the freeze going on right now.
2005000	2006000	Yeah.
2006000	2007000	What's going on?
2007000	2009000	Is the weather nuts or something?
2009000	2014000	It's been kind of hot.
2014000	2016000	It's been kind of hot recently.
2016000	2018000	Well tell us about E3.
2018000	2020000	What are your thoughts on E3 so far?
2020000	2026000	Well one thing that caught my attention actually was Nintendo's press conference when they were doing the DS game.
2026000	2028000	They showed Diddy Kong Racing.
2028000	2031000	They had them show Snowball Valley from the original on there.
2031000	2033000	It was interesting.
2033000	2042000	You've got a good eye because honestly I was one of those people that didn't really care about Diddy Kong Racing because I was too distracted by the thoughts of Star Fox on the DS.
2042000	2045000	Because they kind of showed that all at once and I was like ooh Star Fox.
2045000	2047000	Ah fuck Diddy Kong I want Star Fox.
2047000	2049000	Diddy Kong Racing sucked anyways.
2049000	2053000	Well this is Nintendo Maniac so he might have a different opinion.
2053000	2054000	Alright.
2054000	2057000	You got any questions for us Nintendo Maniac?
2057000	2063000	Um, let's see...
2063000	2066000	Oh yeah.
2066000	2068000	Oh you know what never mind on that question.
2068000	2069000	Alright.
2069000	2071000	Let's see is there anything else?
2071000	2075000	Oh how long did you have to wait to get to play Twilight Princess?
2075000	2077000	To get to play what?
2077000	2079000	To get to play Twilight Princess.
2079000	2080000	I can't.
2080000	2081000	Twilight Princess.
2081000	2082000	Oh Twilight Princess.
2082000	2086000	I waited about 30 to 45 minutes.
2086000	2090000	There were people in front of us who were hogging it and passing it off to their friends and everything.
2090000	2097000	And so we actually waited for a while and then we just ended up talking about all kinds of other things and then by the time we were up there.
2097000	2102000	Keep in mind though she was in the early access media hours which was a benefit.
2102000	2105000	Now I'm talking about once I was already in.
2105000	2106000	Oh damn.
2106000	2111000	Yeah see it takes about an hour to two and a half hours from what they told me to get into the Wii area.
2111000	2116000	And then you got to wait behind people. It's just normal kiosk once you get in there.
2116000	2120000	Alright Nintendo Maniac 64 thanks so much for the call. We're going to go ahead and let you go buddy okay?
2120000	2121000	Okay.
2121000	2122000	Alright have a good one.
2122000	2123000	Bye.
2123000	2127000	Alright we're going to take one more call. Let's see who we got.
2127000	2131000	Lawrence Young the man on the controls. Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2131000	2133000	Hey this is SSJ100Mav.
2133000	2137000	SSJ100Mav what's on your mind buddy? Thanks for the call. What's going on?
2137000	2144000	Hey I was wondering what you guys thought of the new test members on Super Smash Brothers.
2144000	2150000	Super Smash Brothers. Loki you pulled up the story. Fill us in on what's going on with Super Smash Brothers.
2150000	2156000	Well they announced today that there's going to be a title called Super Smash Brothers Brawl coming out for the Wii.
2156000	2161000	Looks like it's going to be controlled kind of the same way as the original Super Smash Brothers.
2161000	2165000	Probably not with the Wii controller but then again we don't know we're just speculating.
2165000	2174000	However some of the characters in it are quite interesting. For example you've got Snake from Metal Gear Solid.
2174000	2175000	That is crazy.
2175000	2177000	Pit from Kid Icarus.
2177000	2179000	Yay!
2179000	2187000	Nintendo thank you for finally fucking acknowledging this game you've ignored for the past like 20 years.
2187000	2192000	You have Wario is going to be another one and also Zero Suit Samus.
2192000	2194000	Ooh that's pretty hot.
2194000	2203000	Which was pretty interesting and then there was one more I want to say oh god I don't remember some metal robot thing.
2203000	2212000	But one of the very interesting things that's on here they show one of the attacks and what's one of the attacks but an Nintendog licking the screen.
2212000	2213000	Oh Jesus.
2213000	2215000	He's so bumpy.
2215000	2216000	You guys.
2216000	2217000	And Snake has his box.
2217000	2218000	Alright.
2218000	2219000	That's great.
2219000	2224000	This is J100 Matt we got to wrap up and thanks so much for the call alright. Have a good one buddy.
2224000	2225000	It is good.
2225000	2226000	Alright.
2226000	2233000	So that's going to be our last call for the night we're going to wrap up so that we can get out of here so all games interactive can take over for a little bit so.
2233000	2234000	Oh stretch.
2234000	2236000	No I'm getting the stretch it out sign.
2236000	2238000	Ok never mind then we won't.
2238000	2240000	Comments from chat room.
2240000	2242000	Boss Tone, Totion they all want to know.
2242000	2244000	Dance Dance TV.
2244000	2246000	What the hell do we think of this?
2246000	2255000	If you guys didn't hear what is it Loki correct me if I'm wrong because I was reading about this late last night CBS television is option Dance Dance TV right.
2255000	2256000	Yeah.
2256000	2262000	And Dance Dance TV is going to be a show that's going to be what the Saturday morning slumber party on CBS or something like that.
2262000	2267000	I don't know and I'm kind of afraid to even consider wanting to know.
2267000	2277000	What I picked up on it is that it's like it's supposed to be teams of kids competing against each other and it's inspired by DDR or something like that.
2277000	2286000	So you know what guys from Konami's perspective it's all about whatever is going to sell more games right.
2286000	2288000	I don't see this as a bad thing.
2288000	2289000	Am I going to watch it.
2289000	2290000	Fuck no.
2290000	2294000	But am I going to hate it just because it's out there.
2294000	2318000	No I understand we got to do crazy things to promote our stuff sometimes I don't I don't think it's a bad thing and I don't think it's going to make DDR look stupid because I honestly if somebody were to come up to me and tell me dude you're playing that DDR game that's on a little girls morning TV show I would say dude you were watching Saturday morning TV for little girls.
2318000	2324000	I don't know. It looks stupid. I'm not watching it but I don't know.
2324000	2329000	Zander C in chat room says they're a little late to be making a DVR TV show.
2329000	2331000	They should have tried that back in 2002.
2331000	2333000	Remember DVR the movie.
2333000	2335000	Oh that was such a fan thing.
2335000	2336000	I know.
2336000	2337000	All right.
2337000	2341000	I'm going to kind of try to wind it down here a little bit.
2341000	2344000	I want to go around and talk about what are you guys looking forward to tomorrow.
2344000	2345000	It's a three day show.
2345000	2346000	What do you want to do tomorrow.
2346000	2347000	Dark Sakura.
2347000	2354000	Tomorrow I'm actually planning on hanging out with SEGA and Namco Bandai a bit more.
2354000	2360000	But SEGA really because they have a game I want to actually see if it plays just right.
2360000	2364000	They had I went by and someone was playing Mighty Final Fight on a PSP.
2364000	2366000	And you know I love Final Fight.
2366000	2367000	I think that's like Capcom collection.
2367000	2368000	Yeah.
2368000	2371000	I played Power Stone collection.
2371000	2373000	It's just not that I missed the Dreamcast.
2373000	2376000	It's not the same on the small screen I'm sorry.
2376000	2383000	Well this I was a little surprised that the games that are on it they have the NES versions
2383000	2388000	of the games like they have the Nintendo version of Strider which was I don't like it because
2388000	2393000	it's that whole story thing based off of the old Strider manga that was out a few years
2393000	2395000	ago.
2395000	2398000	I would much rather have them do like you know a Mega Drive collection where we have
2398000	2404000	Strider you know like the actual arcade Strider and you know actual arcade Final Fight in
2404000	2408000	this you know because the PSP could easily do it but these are Nintendo.
2408000	2411000	This is going to be random but I forgot to tell you Strider's on Game Cab now.
2411000	2412000	I knew that.
2412000	2413000	Pretty hot huh.
2413000	2415000	You told me yesterday.
2415000	2421000	Now Jamie did you see that they had that Capcom classic collection mini that's going to be
2421000	2426000	on the Game Boy Advance which has Strider and Bionic Commando.
2426000	2431000	Well that's the other game that was on the PSP thing was Bionic Commando.
2431000	2432000	Excellent.
2432000	2437000	Honestly I love Mighty Final Fight but I have that on Nintendo.
2437000	2439000	I have all those on Nintendo.
2439000	2441000	I can just play them on Nintendo.
2441000	2445000	So that just seems like sort of a waste of the PSP right there even though I love all
2445000	2446000	those games.
2446000	2451000	So I do plan on giving it a play, see how it plays, see if it's anything like it, if
2451000	2455000	it'd be worth it to me if it adds anything or anything worthwhile but I'm definitely
2455000	2462000	going to be hanging out around Capcom and Sega and Namco Bandai tomorrow.
2462000	2463000	Alright.
2463000	2465000	Going to chat room for some comments here.
2465000	2468000	Rockus, O-L-R Rockus wants to know in chat.allgames.com.
2468000	2471000	Song list updates for the DDR's anyone?
2471000	2472000	Honestly I'm going to be honest with you.
2472000	2474000	Check DDRfreak.com or BomaniStyle.com.
2474000	2476000	I'm sure they have it up.
2476000	2481000	I know I played Precious, some remix of Precious by Depeche Mode in the universe one and I
2481000	2489000	played Listen to Your Heart in UltraMix 4 and I played Since You've Been Gone on Supernova.
2489000	2494000	I did get to play Seduction in the vocal mix now which is in Supernova in the arcade.
2494000	2495000	Sweet.
2495000	2497000	Actually I did want to issue a challenge.
2497000	2498000	Okay.
2498000	2504000	If any of our listeners are at E3 I would love to meet people up at SNK to own them
2504000	2506000	on King of Fighters 2006.
2506000	2507000	Awesome.
2507000	2511000	Quick programming note just for people here on the live stream, sorry to your podcast
2511000	2512000	folks over here.
2512000	2513000	That's alright.
2513000	2515000	All Games Interactive will be going on after Gamer Andy.
2515000	2519000	We're not, so we're going, O-L-R is going to go until about 8.15.
2519000	2520000	Oh are we really?
2520000	2521000	Okay.
2521000	2524000	So I'm letting them know at the same time instead of trying to whisper in their ear.
2524000	2525000	Okay.
2525000	2529000	So yeah, but Gamer Andy live from the Microsoft press conference at 8.15 and then All Games
2529000	2532000	Interactive at 9.30 when they get kicked out of the Microsoft press conference.
2532000	2533000	Alright.
2533000	2534000	So you're, don't worry about ending right now.
2534000	2535000	Alright.
2535000	2536000	You've got a little while longer.
2536000	2538000	But if you want to take more calls, that's cool.
2538000	2540000	Alright, maybe we'll do more calls in a little bit.
2540000	2543000	For right now though, let's finish up this thought we were going down.
2543000	2545000	Something you want to look at tomorrow.
2545000	2547000	Loki, what are you going to be doing tomorrow?
2547000	2552000	I will probably be hitting up the Sony booth because I was mainly in, was it South Hall
2552000	2553000	today.
2553000	2555000	So I need to hit up West Hall.
2555000	2560000	There's still parts of South Hall that I haven't seen so I might need to go back there.
2560000	2563000	I actually hit up a lot of the Korean booths today.
2563000	2565000	I think just because I was that bored.
2565000	2567000	And then, I don't know.
2567000	2572000	Probably, yeah, just hitting up some of the games I haven't played for Sony.
2572000	2574000	Just trying all the new ones.
2574000	2580000	Maybe trying Nintendo again to see if I can try playing, you know, Metroid Prime 3 or
2580000	2581000	something like that.
2581000	2583000	Other than that, I don't know.
2583000	2586000	Oh, I got to check out the PSP stuff definitely.
2586000	2587000	Yeah.
2587000	2588000	I didn't do that either.
2588000	2591000	Let's go to the, we got the call sign.
2591000	2593000	So let's go to the phones.
2593000	2594000	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
2594000	2595000	Who's this?
2595000	2596000	This is SilentWind96.
2596000	2597000	Hello, SilentWind96.
2597000	2598000	What's on your mind?
2598000	2599000	Oh, just chilling here.
2599000	2600000	I'm down the street in my hotel and I was...
2600000	2601000	Come on down.
2601000	2602000	Yeah.
2602000	2603000	I didn't, I couldn't get a pass.
2603000	2604000	So I couldn't, I couldn't get a temporary job at EB Games or nothing so I could get
2604000	2605000	into this joint.
2605000	2606000	But...
2606000	2607000	Wait, wait.
2607000	2608000	You couldn't get into E3 at all?
2608000	2609000	No, I don't have any credentials to get in.
2609000	2610000	So I couldn't get into E3 at all.
2610000	2625000	No, I don't have any credentials to get in so I couldn't really...
2625000	2626000	No, come to the outpost.
2626000	2627000	You know what?
2627000	2628000	At the outpost, you don't need a credential.
2628000	2629000	You can get in here.
2629000	2630000	Oh, really?
2630000	2631000	Yeah.
2631000	2632000	I'll tell you what.
2632000	2633000	You know what?
2633000	2634000	I'll get you in.
2634000	2636000	We will get you in this place for free.
2636000	2637000	Right?
2637000	2638000	Can we do that?
2638000	2639000	Yeah.
2639000	2640000	You know what?
2640000	2641000	I can't...
2641000	2642000	Does he have a...
2642000	2643000	Can you send somebody...
2643000	2644320	How do we get him in touch with us?
2644320	2646920	Actually, you're in chat so you just PM me your name.
2646920	2647920	Okay.
2647920	2650320	I want you to send a private message to Black Wolf and he'll get you in touch.
2650320	2651320	Okay.
2651320	2652320	Get on down here.
2652320	2653320	You can get in this place at least.
2653320	2654320	Oh, yeah.
2654320	2655320	Thank you.
2655320	2656320	All right.
2656320	2657320	Any questions you want to know about E3?
2657320	2658320	I'm so sorry to hear you didn't get in.
2658320	2661320	Any thing you want to mention about the show or?
2661320	2663320	Well, first of all I just...
2663320	2664960	I love the show, guys.
2664960	2671320	I mean, I have a crappy internet connection here at the hotel but I can at least hear
2671320	2672320	the stream.
2672320	2673320	Thank you so much.
2673320	2675320	But other than that, I picked up a...
2675320	2683640	I got a DS Live I imported recently and I'm loving it.
2683640	2685080	How is that?
2685080	2686080	Is it...
2686080	2687080	That's great.
2687080	2690080	What makes it so much better than the original DS?
2690080	2696800	Well, I never touched the original DS so I liked this and it looked really cool.
2696800	2704320	I found it on eBay and I blew away Scott and Lawrence and I told him I got it for $99 off
2704320	2705320	of eBay.
2705320	2706320	Wow.
2706320	2711440	They actually had this for their demo unit for...
2711440	2714440	It was some really awful card game but it was...
2714440	2717960	I have to say that I enjoyed the brighter screen on it.
2717960	2720200	It felt a little bit easier.
2720200	2722080	Yeah, it was alright.
2722080	2723080	Alright.
2723080	2726600	Well, SilentWind96, we'll see you in a little bit and you're getting the hookup, man, because
2726600	2728760	this is an invite-only party tonight here.
2728760	2729760	In television.
2729760	2730760	Yeah.
2730760	2731760	The Mario Rock Opera is...
2731760	2733080	Mario Rock Opera is setting up.
2733080	2735400	They got a whole DJ thing down there.
2735400	2736400	I mean, there's stuff all over.
2736400	2737400	Yeah, Supernova Sound.
2737400	2741720	In television, everywhere, but there's new stuff, too, but who doesn't love these classics?
2741720	2742720	Okay.
2742720	2743720	It's great.
2743720	2744720	Get your butt down here right now.
2744720	2745720	Wait.
2745720	2746720	Where did I meet you?
2746720	2747720	Alright.
2747720	2748720	We'll see you in the details.
2748720	2749720	PM me in chat.
2749720	2750720	Alright.
2750720	2751720	Cool.
2751720	2752720	Have a good one, buddy.
2752720	2753720	Alright.
2753720	2754720	Talk to you later.
2754720	2755720	Thank you.
2755720	2756720	Alright.
2756720	2757720	Let's see.
2757720	2758720	Can we give out the number one more time?
2758720	2761720	I guess we'll do a couple more calls if there's anyone wants to call in.
2761720	2762840	1-866-8800156.
2762840	2765120	That is a toll-free number in the United States.
2765120	2766120	Okay.
2766120	2770080	And don't call in asking to get in free tonight because we just gave our one away, so that's
2770080	2771080	it.
2771080	2772080	We're done.
2772080	2773080	But here's the good news.
2773080	2778400	You can come Thursday or Friday and you can get in and, you know, it's a good time.
2778400	2781400	So if you still want to come down, Thursday and Friday we'll be here as well because we're
2781400	2782400	taping both nights.
2782400	2783400	Okay.
2783400	2784400	Where did we leave off?
2784400	2785400	Bobby.
2785400	2787320	Oh, Bobby's on the phone, so I'll go.
2787320	2789240	One thing I want to see tomorrow.
2789240	2793440	I didn't freaking touch the Wii, so I guess I'm going to have to wait in that.
2793440	2794440	You want to touch the Wii?
2794440	2796900	I want to touch Nintendo's Wii.
2796900	2797900	So bad.
2797900	2803880	So I'm going to wait in that horrible line and just get it over with so I can say I played
2803880	2806200	the damn Wii so I can come here and tell you all about it.
2806200	2808360	So that's essentially my day.
2808360	2813640	Otherwise, I didn't see anything in West Hall besides Sony and I know Tecmo's over there
2813640	2816400	and I know there's other booths over there I want to check out.
2816400	2825560	I would suggest going by Atlas for Disgaea 2 and Koei, of course, for Guitar Man Lives.
2825560	2831200	I want to play their Fatal in their show also.
2831200	2832200	Let's see.
2832200	2834320	I'm going to go over to chat here and see what's going on here.
2834320	2838300	Tiger Claw wants to know, are we going to be able to hear the Mario Rock Opera tonight
2838300	2839460	as well?
2839460	2843280	I think unfortunately they don't because Gamer Andy's going to be live somewhere else right
2843280	2844520	at that moment, right?
2844520	2846080	That was what that phone call was.
2846080	2847320	Oh, really?
2847320	2848320	They're not going to be live.
2848320	2850840	They cannot get it to work on Microsoft servers.
2850840	2851840	They're going to still record.
2851840	2854640	I apologize to all of Gamer Andy's fans in chat.
2854640	2855720	There are some in there.
2855720	2860120	All Games Interactive will be going on and they'll still have the show up on their podcast
2860120	2861120	feed.
2861120	2862120	Well, okay.
2862120	2863120	So the Gamer Andy fans still have that.
2863120	2864120	Right.
2864120	2867240	And Gamer Andy will be here tomorrow night.
2867240	2869520	Nice guy, Gamer Andy, and a lot of friends.
2869520	2870520	He's got quite a click.
2870520	2871520	They've got eight people.
2871520	2873200	He's got a huge entourage.
2873200	2875200	Gamerandy.com.
2875200	2876200	And they've got the hookup.
2876200	2877760	They played Gears of War.
2877760	2881680	I was talking to Andy because they got behind closed doors at Microsoft and they played
2881680	2882680	Gears of War.
2882680	2883680	They said it's awesome.
2883680	2884680	They're getting it.
2884680	2885680	Yeah.
2885680	2886880	Major Nelson was on their show tonight, right?
2886880	2887880	I believe so.
2887880	2888880	Yeah.
2888880	2891680	And we were trying to rig it to get it to work and they just can't get it to work on
2891680	2892680	their Wi-Fi over there.
2892680	2893680	Frickin' technology.
2893680	2894680	Yeah.
2894680	2895680	All right.
2895680	2897880	Bobby, what are you looking forward to doing tomorrow at the show?
2897880	2898880	Wii.
2898880	2899880	Wii.
2899880	2902360	You're going to go Wii, Wii, Wii all the way home?
2902360	2903680	No, just in the morning.
2903680	2905720	Just going to go over there and wait, whatever, the two hours or whatever.
2905720	2907720	You're going to go over and Wii in West Hall in the morning?
2907720	2908720	Yeah.
2908720	2909720	All right.
2909720	2910720	Yeah, I'm going directly there.
2910720	2911720	Right in the center of Nintendo's booth I'm going to Wii.
2911720	2912720	Yeah.
2912720	2915600	I'm going to go with my Wii and then because I really want to play the conducting game
2915600	2920480	and that drum demo, you know, the virtual drum because I mean I'm a musician and I want
2920480	2925360	to see if I'm any better at Miyamoto than he was at his conference.
2925360	2928040	But other than that, you know, checking out more of Microsoft's booth, I really want to
2928040	2929920	see Luminous Live just like you.
2929920	2930920	Yeah.
2930920	2935240	So that, you know, and I still got to go do Kensha Hall stuff for my show sometime.
2935240	2936240	All right.
2936240	2938000	Dark Soccer wants to address chat.
2938000	2940560	Xander, she was asking about Fire Emblem.
2940560	2946000	There were ads for Fire Emblem and it was there at Nintendo's press conference, but
2946000	2948200	I didn't see anything playable for it.
2948200	2953680	Then again, I didn't look too deep into the DS area, honestly.
2953680	2957200	So I will go hunt out anything on Fire Emblem tomorrow I can.
2957200	2959120	I know lots of people are interested in that series.
2959120	2960120	I love the series.
2960120	2962320	I can't play it for crap, but I love the series.
2962320	2966080	So I will look up Fire Emblem stuff for y'all tomorrow.
2966080	2968440	All right.
2968440	2973040	What's done in chat right now is questioning is Super Smash Brothers, this new one, a real
2973040	2974040	game?
2974040	2975960	Or was it just a whole fan service thing?
2975960	2980040	No, they have pictures from the conference with the people, with Miyamoto in the end.
2980040	2981760	Yeah, I would think it's real.
2981760	2982760	Oh, okay.
2982760	2983760	Yeah.
2983760	2985240	They say it in chat.
2985240	2986240	I say it out loud.
2986240	2987240	You know, that's what we do.
2987240	2992160	I even have this cool montage where Snake is talking to Ocelot or whatever, you know,
2992160	2993160	whatever his name.
2993160	2994160	Otacon.
2994160	2995160	Otacon.
2995160	2996160	All right.
2996160	2997960	Listen, I don't play Metal Gear Solid, so that's why I'm going to butcher everything.
2997960	3002640	All I know is it's a game about a guy named, you know, Solid Snake, and that's as far as
3002640	3003640	I go.
3003640	3008800	Folks in chat want to know about Excite Truck.
3008800	3009800	You guys saw it.
3009800	3010800	I didn't.
3010800	3011800	What do you think about Excite Truck?
3011800	3012860	I want that game.
3012860	3016800	It looks like burn or it looks like it scores like burnout.
3016800	3017880	It's very interesting.
3017880	3023480	The truck is extremely fast, so it's kind of like Excite Bike a little bit.
3023480	3024480	Just very interesting.
3024480	3025480	I don't know.
3025480	3029920	No one seemed to be able to keep their truck on the road, but it looked fun.
3029920	3031600	I like the way they do their scoring system.
3031600	3036240	It's kind of like burnout where you get points for, you know, driving dangerously, catching
3036240	3040320	a lot of air, going fast, being in first place, and that stuff, and they'll give you a ranking
3040320	3046880	on the race, everything from, like, D to triple A, S. I don't know.
3046880	3050000	They did say, though, that it wasn't, you weren't going to be able to do anything online
3050000	3051000	with it.
3051000	3053000	It's kind of dumb.
3053000	3057880	I'm hoping that they have the whole, you know, build a level, save it, take it to your friend's
3057880	3058880	house.
3058880	3060760	Nintendo needs to do online, dammit.
3060760	3063840	Get with the program.
3063840	3068040	They did have Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam there, and I didn't get to play that or Tony Hawk's
3068040	3073480	Project 8, which I have no idea what the hell Project 8 is, but I don't know.
3073480	3075080	It should be good.
3075080	3083520	Project Cammer was another game that they had at the Wii booths, and I didn't know,
3083520	3086520	I'm not very interested in that game, to be honest.
3086520	3088520	They had a Sonic game, though.
3088520	3091800	Sonic, what was it, Wildfire?
3091800	3093800	How was that?
3093800	3094800	I didn't play it.
3094800	3095800	Looked good, though.
3095800	3096800	They had Bomberman.
3096800	3097800	They had Bomberman, was there.
3097800	3098800	And the Virtual Console.
3098800	3099800	Super Monkey Ball.
3099800	3100800	They had the Virtual Console.
3100800	3101800	Virtual Console.
3101800	3106800	They were playing them.
3106800	3107800	I want to see it all.
3107800	3108800	Tell me about it.
3108800	3109800	Mario World.
3109800	3110800	Tell me, tell me, tell me about it.
3110800	3111800	How did it work?
3111800	3112800	How does it look?
3112800	3117200	I actually, I didn't get to check it out because I was feeling a little ill.
3117200	3122040	We will have some, hopefully some pictures online soon of the Virtual Console, but in
3122040	3128520	the meantime, if you are really, you know, trying to get a look at it, I believe Joystiq
3128520	3134840	had pictures of it online and I'm trying to find the link so we can put it in chat, but
3134840	3135840	it looked pretty cool.
3135840	3142440	They had, on demo, they actually had the Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo.
3142440	3150880	I think Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64, Bonk for the TurboGrafx, Sonic for the Genesis,
3150880	3153080	of course, and Super Nintendo.
3153080	3155200	They had Super Mario World.
3155200	3156200	Super Mario World.
3156200	3159600	So, definitely really cool looking.
3159600	3169840	Yeah, it looks very solid, very sexy, very white, but here, now obviously this is not
3169840	3175400	really great radio, but Rob, here's pictures of the Virtual Console on my laptop here.
3175400	3176920	Oh, that's pretty hot.
3176920	3177920	I like that.
3177920	3178920	Yeah, I do like that.
3178920	3179920	It's bigger than I thought.
3179920	3182360	It's on a gadget, guys, if you want to go there.
3182360	3184920	I thought it would have more games on the screen at once.
3184920	3185920	That's kind of interesting.
3185920	3186920	Yeah, so.
3186920	3191360	A real quick plug for the websites, E3 on PSP.com, Loki, you've been updating that like
3191360	3192360	a mofo, right?
3192360	3193360	Uh-huh, I've been trying.
3193360	3198400	I've been getting behind a little bit, but I do have some stuff there from actually the
3198400	3202240	Nintendo party that I attended, which should be good.
3202240	3204520	So we got some pictures of that.
3204520	3206040	Let's come back to that in a minute.
3206040	3208640	Dark Soccer, what sites have you been working on?
3208640	3213960	Actually, I did a little blogging today on stuff.orangelandradio.com.
3213960	3217040	Yeah, I have a backlog I'm going to post there soon, too.
3217040	3223480	I just happened to go up to the press room just to relax for a little bit, and I figured
3223480	3227080	I'd go ahead and update the stuff blog, so there's my initial impressions there.
3227080	3232680	That was everything up until I headed back, actually right before I ran into you guys
3232680	3237160	when I was coming out of the west.
3237160	3239160	I'm sorry I'm all backwards today.
3239160	3240160	I'm sorry.
3240160	3245840	So yeah, if you want to check out just what my impression was as of that moment, I have
3245840	3247440	a few details there.
3247440	3255720	I had just also checked out Guitar Room Man at that point, and also there's a discussion
3255720	3263400	going on in our live journal community at orangeland.livejournal.com.
3263400	3264400	You can get there.
3264400	3266640	I'm sure there's stuff going up on our MySpace.
3266640	3273160	I haven't looked at MySpace all week, and there's various other discussions that we're
3273160	3278880	involved with at different locations, just depends on where you happen to find it.
3278880	3282280	Bobby, there's a question backlogged from chat from five minutes ago.
3282280	3286840	Yeah, it was like Boston asked if we've ever had any random bumping with celebrities, and
3286840	3289000	you were with me, Rob, when we saw this.
3289000	3292520	Oh, how desperate somebody is for a paycheck.
3292520	3300600	We saw Gilbert Gottfried with G4 interviewing somebody in Kensha, and we're like, is he
3300600	3302360	that desperate for a paycheck?
3302360	3303440	I just rolled my eyes.
3303440	3304640	I'm just like, I don't get it.
3304640	3306440	I don't get G4 anymore, so whatever.
3306440	3310440	I saw him in South Hall, and they were making him record, I guess, a bumper or something.
3310440	3312440	He's all, I'm here at E3, man.
3312440	3315720	I was supposed to be in Alaska or something like that.
3315720	3317720	I was like, okay.
3317720	3325320	The last thing I saw him do that wasn't an animated movie was USA Up All Night.
3325320	3326320	Any other celebrity sightings?
3326320	3332240	I don't know if this counts, but I got to meet Tommy Tallarico, thanks to Bobby.
3332240	3335440	And Becky Young, who's smoking.
3335440	3338720	Nice guy, but he had so much makeup on because he was doing the HDTV thing.
3338720	3342280	Gameplay HD, which is on Voom, Disney Network.
3342280	3346200	He looked like, who's that guy on Dancing with the Stars?
3346200	3348200	George Hamilton?
3348200	3349200	No, I'm teasing.
3349200	3350200	He was very nice.
3350200	3351200	I'm totally teasing.
3351200	3352200	Very nice guy.
3352200	3354200	Glad to meet him.
3354200	3356200	Any other celebrity run-ins, you guys?
3356200	3363000	I got to meet, well, I didn't get to meet him, but I saw the guy who worked on the DS
3363000	3365000	Castlevania games.
3365000	3370760	And then, as I'm actually showing Rob my picture right now, I had my meeting, well, not necessarily
3370760	3375840	that I actually got to meet him other than to say thank you, but Koji Kondo, I got his
3375840	3376840	autograph.
3376840	3386000	And I happened to be at the press line for Nintendo when they were doing an interview
3386000	3387000	with Miyamoto.
3387000	3390920	You've got a lot of great pictures there, Dark Sakura, you've got to get those on the
3390920	3391920	site soon.
3391920	3397040	I haven't figured out how to, because I'm actually using my, no, no, no, I don't want
3397040	3398040	to do that.
3398040	3402080	I'm actually using my camcorder as a camera, too.
3402080	3405800	And I'm trying to get the picture to show Rob, there it is.
3405800	3406800	Oh, Miyamoto!
3406800	3407800	He's so goofy.
3407800	3413320	I got a really good picture of Miyamoto, so that was really it.
3413320	3415240	Loki, any other celebrity sightings for you?
3415240	3419880	No, I didn't see anybody, I was looking, I didn't make it by the booth with Paris Hilton
3419880	3420880	Disposal.
3420880	3421880	Ah, fucker.
3421880	3428040	Alright, going to chat room, chat.allgames.com for this week while we're live at the E3 Outpost.
3428040	3434320	Xander wants to know, did we see In the Groove 2 consumer style, conspicuously absent from
3434320	3436920	Red Octane's booth completely?
3436920	3438720	All they have is Guitar Hero 2.
3438720	3442840	I'll give you this, their booth is 50 times better than it was last year, but it's all
3442840	3443840	Guitar Hero 2.
3443840	3446840	They are not showing In the Groove in any capacity, so it's great.
3446840	3449720	I didn't hear anything about the Activision deal either.
3449720	3450720	You know what?
3450720	3451720	You want to hear us?
3451720	3454800	I overheard Activision people talking about the acquisition.
3454800	3459360	As I was walking out of Kensha, I overheard Activision people talking about it.
3459360	3462560	And they were just saying, they were just very happy about it.
3462560	3465720	They were like, well, I'm glad we got them because someone was going to eventually, you
3465720	3467520	know, it was basically the tone of the whole thing.
3467520	3470760	So I don't know if I was supposed to hear that, but I did.
3470760	3472800	Activision's very happy to be getting Red Octane.
3472800	3485320	So oh, my God, the puppies on IGN.com, the Smash Brothers, oh, my Lord, but I lost my
3485320	3486320	train of thought.
3486320	3487320	It's alright.
3487320	3489800	Damn you for distracting me with puppy.
3489800	3490800	Sorry.
3490800	3494680	Just a quick programming note for those that are listening live, if you're tuning in right
3494680	3498920	now because you're expecting to hear gamer Andy, unfortunately, they're having technical
3498920	3502480	difficulties will not be able to do a live broadcast tonight.
3502480	3507000	He will be doing a podcast on his normal podcast stream.
3507000	3508000	So check that out.
3508000	3512280	However, all games interactive will be here live right after we wrap up in just a few
3512280	3513280	minutes here.
3513280	3517200	And there might be a lot of people on that, too, you know, I've got to pee so bad.
3517200	3522280	I know it's excellent about this, but IGN has a thing about Super Smash Brothers Brawl
3522280	3523280	in there.
3523280	3530720	And they said it says actually that they wanted the decision to include Solid Snake is basically
3530720	3537040	from when Kojima actually begged to have the Metal Gear character in the last Smash Brothers
3537040	3538040	game.
3538040	3541600	They said when asked about the possibility of Sonic the Hedgehog appearing in the game
3541600	3546320	as well, they said there are possibilities for other third parties as well.
3546320	3552400	And it may even maybe that even there are characters that might be included.
3552400	3557240	But right now they're still, you know, in talks, so awesome.
3557240	3561240	I was always hoping that they'd have a fighting game, including all the characters from different
3561240	3562240	games.
3562240	3567500	Well, the closest we had gotten before the Smash Brothers, well, there was Sonic the
3567500	3570840	Fighters, which actually, you know, I didn't see that Sonic collection that they had last
3570840	3575300	year where they had supposed to have all the old Saturn Sonic games.
3575300	3581320	And all I got to say is if they make a new Kid Icarus game, that's going to look sweet.
3581320	3582320	Oh, yeah.
3582320	3583320	Wow.
3583320	3584320	That looks great.
3584320	3585320	Kid Icarus.
3585320	3586320	Wow.
3586320	3587320	We transitioned.
3587320	3594520	Are we about ready to wrap up?
3594520	3595520	Your producer left.
3595520	3596520	Oh, it's all right.
3596520	3597520	I'll go run and find him.
3597520	3598520	OK.
3598520	3599520	Thank you very much.
3599520	3602720	We can just stay here for a little bit longer and be the fabulous Internet celebrities we
3602720	3603720	are.
3603720	3608440	The Nintendo Party, I just got a I just got a call on the phone, so I got to make this
3608440	3609440	quick.
3609440	3610440	OK.
3610440	3611440	Let's hear about the Nintendo Party real quick.
3611440	3612440	OK.
3612440	3613440	So anyways, I went to the Nintendo Party.
3613440	3614440	They had Black Eyed Peas playing.
3614440	3615440	It was kind of interesting.
3615440	3621680	I think those I missed the previous I didn't get to play games beforehand, but what's even
3621680	3625880	more interesting on the way there, I saw a runaway bus smashed through two cars and into
3625880	3629040	a telephone pole and then into a Rite Aid.
3629040	3631040	So that was pretty awesome.
3631040	3638520	Well, brutal, but the party wasn't really my thing because a lot of people I didn't
3638520	3639520	know there.
3639520	3642400	But all the big names, I guess, were there, even from Nintendo, of course, no one had
3642400	3643400	a name badge or anything.
3643400	3647080	So we didn't know who the hell it was, who all right.
3647080	3651960	Well, that's going to do it about do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live
3651960	3652960	at the E3 Outpost.
3652960	3655160	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
3655160	3656160	Dark Sakura.
3656160	3660960	I'd like to put out the funny deal that Captain N wasn't really an intended character.
3660960	3662240	And the show sucked.
3662240	3664440	So reject false icons.
3664440	3665440	Final thought.
3665440	3666440	Loki.
3666440	3675240	Stay tuned on E3 on the PSP.com and definitely going to have a lot more stuff on there.
3675240	3680420	I'm just kind of backlogged and getting everything on there, lots more videos and a lot more
3680420	3681420	everything.
3681420	3682560	So keep watching.
3682560	3685840	Final thought, Mr. Bobby Black Wolf and plug your site already.
3685840	3688180	BobbyBlackWolfShow.com.
3688180	3693080	We're going to have our E3 show is Friday night, 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific right
3693080	3694280	before OLR.
3694280	3699000	But I hope all three of you at least show up for a couple minutes at least.
3699000	3702860	And actually, you guys should check out the Tuesday night episode of All Games Interactive.
3702860	3705560	It has both Sky and Dark Sakura on it as well.
3705560	3706560	Good times.
3706560	3707560	Good times.
3707560	3708560	Yes.
3708560	3709560	Debating with Scott Rubin was a good time.
3709560	3712400	And you guys can do it again tonight after you pee.
3712400	3714280	I've got to wee in the worst way.
3714280	3715280	That's my final thought.
3715280	3716280	30 minutes.
3716280	3719960	It's a different nature game bar that Rob gave me, I haven't eaten since 10, so.
3719960	3721960	I need to drink.
3721960	3722960	All right.
3722960	3723960	We're going to wrap it up here.
3723960	3725640	For those of you guys listening live, stay tuned.
3725640	3728000	All Games Interactive coming up in about 30 minutes.
3728000	3729000	About 30.
