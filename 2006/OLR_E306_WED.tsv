32810	34292	Good evening, everybody.
34352	38917	We are live at the E3 Outpost in West Los Angeles.
39298	44204	So if the sound sounds a little bit different tonight, that's because we're recording live here at the Arena Interactive Lounge.
44264	45185	My name is Rob Roberts.
45205	46427	You might know me as Sky.
46807	49871	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
50031	50451	Hi.
50632	51112	How you doing?
51752	52333	Tired.
52433	52693	Yeah?
53454	55095	I'm excited and tired at the same time.
55135	56176	It's a very bizarre feeling.
56296	58098	Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.
58278	58538	Hello.
58998	59679	How you doing, Loki?
60940	61641	I'm doing good.
62001	62341	All right.
62762	66164	Also joining us tonight, we have some special guests, or a special guest, I should say.
66224	67606	Say hello to Bobby.
67626	67726	Bobby.
68306	69027	Hey guys.
69047	69667	Hey Bobby.
69967	71048	This is a thrill for me.
71148	72930	It's about time we got you on our show.
73630	75632	It just took E3 to finally get you here.
75672	76913	That's alright.
77493	81516	Also we want to say a shout out to Mr. Lawrence Young who's manning the controls tonight.
81556	83497	We appreciate his help in making the show work.
84318	85939	Alright, let's get right into it.
85979	87000	Let's not waste time.
87240	88521	Let's talk about E3.
88781	93505	I thought we could do, let's go down the line and talk about three interesting things we saw at E3 today.
93865	94626	Jamie, give us one.
95618	98560	I would have to say Zelda Twilight Princess.
99381	100562	Getting to play that was pretty fun.
100822	102904	Now, did you play the Zelda Twilight Princess on the Wii?
103084	103624	Wii!
103824	104425	The Wii!
104445	106686	I played on the Wii, and I went Wii.
106726	108788	Did Nintendo have a huge-ass line for the Wii today?
109308	113592	Not if you made it in there in the early... We got in there at the tail end of the early media hours.
113792	113972	Right.
113992	116554	So we just sort of... Once we got in line, it was pretty cool.
116594	119976	I did get to hear... I never remember his name.
120016	122038	I know his name's Charles, the guy who's Mario's voice.
122358	122938	Oh, right, yeah.
122998	126980	Sing the old Mario theme song from the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.
127020	127641	That's awesome.
128461	132263	The guys in front of us got him to, the guys from the Mushroom Kingdom, got him to sing it.
132843	133803	So I have it on tape.
134003	134564	Sweet.
135004	135324	That's awesome.
135344	135844	It was pretty fun.
135864	141127	So tell us about how is Zelda on the Wii different from what we saw last year with the GameCube?
141687	144449	Well, first of all, I didn't get to see it on the GameCube, so I don't know.
145570	149754	I do know that it is widescreen, whereas the GameCube version is not.
150114	154497	All right, I'm so glad to hear there's widescreen support, because I was really worried about that with Wii.
154577	155959	Well, you're going to get 480p.
156539	156779	Good.
157119	159041	But probably nothing more than that.
159221	159501	All right.
160622	161863	Well, you know, it's something.
162163	164784	At least my widescreen TV isn't going to go to total waste.
165105	165925	So that makes me happy.
167246	169167	Alright, so that's one for Jamie.
169667	171948	Loki, what would you say is one interesting thing you saw today?
172709	178472	My favorite, you know, it was really a toss-up on Sega's booth because there's a few things I liked.
178592	182434	I did get to play my first PS3 game, which would be Full Auto 2.
183355	185776	And, of course, you know, me being such a big Full Auto whore.
185796	186897	They have Full Auto 2 there?
186937	187517	I totally missed that.
187637	189077	Yeah, they had full auto too.
189197	195879	They were debuting basically all the deathmatch modes, which I said should have been in the first one, but no.
196659	202701	So anyways, they had that, and we were basically playing six-player deathmatch and stuff, and if you won, you'd get a hat.
203361	205141	Of course, I don't wear hats, so I didn't care.
205301	208102	But overall, the controls are basically the same.
208682	213563	Horrible framerate problems, just like the first one.
213903	216684	I mean, we're talking dropping down a crawl.
217364	219326	but then again it's not finished either, so.
219386	221269	Do you think it's just an early build issue?
222049	228637	Well, you know, I'm not sure because the fact the first one had really bad frame rate problems too, so you never know.
229338	231100	But I am sure it's not done.
231120	231540	Okay.
232261	236904	I just want to remind folks, if you guys are hearing ambient noise in the background, that is because we're not at your usual studio.
236924	239986	We are at the Arena Interactive Lounge where the E3 Outpost has taken place.
240386	242748	If you're in the LA area, this thing's going on all week.
242888	243468	Come on down.
243508	244929	We're off Santa Monica Boulevard.
244969	247111	We'll be here Thursday and Friday taping live as well.
247491	248792	Other folks are taping too.
248892	251954	Scott Rubin and Lawrence Young doing their show.
252014	253775	Gamer Andy's got his gig going on.
253815	255657	Bobby Blackwolf, Friday night, of course.
257058	258038	You know what this place is?
258058	260360	There's big widescreen TVs everywhere.
260400	261881	It's like a big gamer frat house.
262501	262741	Yeah.
262761	263441	Seriously, what it's like.
263481	263962	It's awesome.
264282	264702	It's cool.
264722	270004	So, again, if we sound a little different out of our elements, it's because we are, but that's a good thing.
270424	275646	So, anyway, I just wanted to give that a plug because we are kind of using their equipment tonight, so we have to give them a big thank you.
275846	277687	And we're also in their chat room because of it.
277707	278708	We're trying to keep an eye on it.
278768	280648	It's a little harder because we're not in our usual setup.
281029	283109	Chat.allgames.com Thank you.
283249	287791	And there's this wristband on my arm that says over 21, which means they have alcohol here.
287811	288852	That means you get to drink.
289372	291073	I got asked if I was over 21.
292625	293526	You always get carded.
295046	297608	No, we didn't get those, so we'll get those later.
297808	298048	Anyway.
298368	299589	Oh, yeah.
299769	300449	You're interesting.
300810	301870	My interesting thing.
302350	308093	I'm going to give a shout-out to the music game fans, because I know we have a lot of music game fans that listen to the program and are dying to know.
308414	312736	So let me talk about the Bomani setup at Konami's booth, which was very interesting.
312756	313957	They sort of have a round setup.
314857	316879	2DX Distorted Machine is there.
317219	319321	Guitar Freaks V2 is there.
319741	320101	Why?
320341	321122	I have no idea.
321202	324885	Konami did not announce that Distorted is coming out for the home here.
325185	327907	They did not announce they're porting Guitar Freaks here in the US.
328187	330990	So they were just there to get butts in the booth, I guess.
332130	335112	I did get a chance to play each of the three new DDR home versions.
335152	336533	I did play around on Universe.
337333	340575	Universe looks a lot better than it does in the trailer, I'll tell you that.
340675	342876	Universe has a very disco, funky feel to it.
343276	344677	The interface is a little crazy.
344717	348799	The song select was kind of... It's like a 3D wheel.
348999	349439	I liked it.
349580	350420	Yeah, I kind of liked it.
350460	350800	I dug it.
350860	352961	And there are repeats from old mixes.
353081	354722	I noticed Gyruss was in the demo.
355703	356723	And there's other stuff, too.
356763	357124	I'm sure...
358284	362007	TDR, Freak Group, OmaniStyle have lists posted already of what's on those games.
362567	364348	I actually really liked Ultramix 4.
364908	366950	I kind of thought Ultramix 4 had the better song list.
367350	369951	The interface is just kind of like an upside-down Ultramix 2.
370872	373073	I mean, it's another Ultramix, but I thought it had a better song list.
373093	374875	It has Listen to Your Heart, it had Bitmania.
375455	377096	I had a lot of fun playing that.
377216	382520	I tried playing doubles on Universe and unfortunately they had the pads set backwards.
383341	384022	So that didn't work.
384842	387204	Supernova is exactly what you'd expect.
387624	389766	And of course they have two Supernova machines, the home version.
390026	392348	But, Jamie, did you play DDR Supernova home version?
392749	392889	No.
393429	394130	David Bowie's in it.
394970	395471	Let's dance.
395871	396011	D.D.R.
413849	415089	Especially these demos.
416730	421151	My thrill on DDR is the extra modes and the extra things that are in it, and they're not in these builds.
421291	425933	I was just glad they had freaking arcade cabinets there because I hate playing on those goddamn softpads.
426193	427673	Did you notice that they have the softpads?
427753	431415	It's like literally saran-wrapped to the floor.
432075	433195	This is not duct tape.
433275	434716	What did you think of the Universe 360 pads?
436633	437713	They're just like soft pads.
437853	442915	I get lost on them again because, you know, I don't know.
443615	446476	I'm actually going to go play Karaoke Revolution Country Edition tomorrow.
446876	448177	Alright, I'm going to our chat room.
448277	450217	Remember, we're temporarily tonight in chat.
450277	453919	Allgames.com will be there all week long because we love Allgames.com.
454699	455159	Let's see.
455319	457400	Weiland wants to know, wait, Bowie is in what?
457720	462081	David Bowie's Let's Dance is going to be a danceable song in DDR Supernova.
465283	467805	And then also going to the chat room there, let's see.
469587	472590	Sephiroth1215, one of our fans, says, I hate Kelly.
473010	476113	Well, you know, a lot of people do, but a lot of people like her, you know?
476313	484080	Speaking of Kelly, it seems that they've dropped the Karaoke Revolution title from American Idol, if you noticed that on the trailer.
484100	484421	Mm-hmm.
484941	485781	Oh, no, I didn't notice.
486122	492364	Well, they didn't really... First off, the game's not even to a point where they can show it at E3, which is why we have country here.
493525	494705	But they dropped the title.
494725	499588	All they really had for the video was just, you know, the intro that you see normally on American Idol.
500088	501108	And it just says, coming in the winter.
501308	501568	Weird.
502109	502389	All right.
504430	507411	Bobby, do you have an interesting thing you want to share with us that you saw today?
508054	514756	Well, unfortunately I didn't get to play all that much today just because of getting in late and just walking around and making sure I saw everything.
515536	526199	Other than the utterly disappointing Square Theater, which is usually a wonderful production with great production values, lights everywhere, everything's synchronized.
526219	528140	This time it was just a digital projection.
528880	530801	I did get to play Gitaro Man Lives.
531741	532762	for the PSP.
533342	535484	And you're sitting there, you're smiling and nodding.
535684	536465	I wouldn't.
536645	538867	It is a straight port of the PlayStation 2.
539207	541829	Same music, same note patterns and everything.
541869	545372	The only thing that has changed is now if you pause it, you can continue.
545412	546553	You don't have to start over.
547454	549516	Actually, you also have a duet mode.
549916	550216	Do they?
550276	551197	Because they didn't show that.
551257	555220	You play as Kira, who was, I guess, the girl in the game.
555701	558263	You can do duet mode with her, and there's a versus mode.
558775	559376	Okay.
559637	561340	There was a versus mode in PS2 version, though.
562161	567792	It was showing it off like it was some sort of Mew thing, but the duet mode I know is Mew.
567912	568253	Okay.
568633	568994	Interesting.
569174	570377	But it's still all the same songs?
571246	572246	That is a bit of a letdown.
572267	577429	I was hoping for some new Guitar Room Man, but I guess some people will be excited to see that it's on the go.
577569	577829	Yeah.
578289	578870	Okay, whatever.
579730	582171	I wanted to go back to this Square Enix trailer.
582191	587654	You know, I feel horrible saying this because I thought Square had some of the nicest staff that I dealt with all day.
587694	589895	They had really great staff, and they were nice.
590775	596238	But the trailer presentation was a letdown because a lot of what they were showing was stuff that's already out.
596578	597918	Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.
598199	598599	Although...
599119	599219	Yeah.
599239	600000	Didn't they, Lauren?
620979	621779	We'll see, we'll see.
621839	628722	I mean, again, these trailers, it's the same reason why I'm not screaming and hollering about Halo 3 yet.
628882	633284	It's a trailer that didn't show us much of the actual game itself, you know what I mean?
633604	637185	Let's wait until I can actually get my hand on the controller, play it, try it out.
638366	641927	You know what, the Square thing will give the fans what they want, so whatever.
642507	643448	They'll have a good time with that.
644828	647390	Jamie, number two, a second interesting thing you saw today.
647530	648170	Guitar Hero 2.
649491	657214	Ah, how is that compared to... It was fun, but it basically brought in the two... Actually, it really added in something else that I wouldn't have minded seeing.
658115	661977	I wanted bass mode in the first one, and this gives me bass mode.
662097	666639	Instead of having versus play, you have cooperative play, which is how I think it should be anyway.
666779	671161	If you've got a band on stage, if one person sucks, the whole band's going to pretty much blow it.
671181	672062	Mm-hmm.
672962	678226	But the way it works now is that player one is lead guitar, player two, depending on song, is either bass or rhythm.
679247	685652	And they're even bringing in the very newest models for their available guitars, the newest Gibson guitars available.
685733	688355	They're still going to have the Flying V, they brought in the Thunderbirds.
689295	689816	Thunderbird now.
690797	694179	They still have the Les Paul, the SGs.
695320	699763	and there's still hidden characters in it, new unlockable content.
701244	703365	I played YYZ, that was like cool.
705582	706463	That was really awesome.
706483	713325	So, I mean, are there enough differences from the first game to make this, you know, a worthwhile sequel?
713585	715905	I didn't see enough to really make a judgment like that yet.
716526	721147	But, you know, just having new songs to play is great.
721587	725668	If it were me, I would have been... I mean, I know it is on PlayStation 2, but...
727549	729711	FanTaz says Halo 3 teaser ripped off System Shock.
748365	754848	So, not a person who wasn't a big fan of the Halo 3, or maybe he was a fan of the Halo 3 teaser, but just felt it, ripped off another one.
755369	759251	Funnydale says, it's sad, Square is turning Final Fantasy into the new Madden.
760231	761272	I kind of agree with that.
761372	762652	They need to get off Final Fantasy 7.
763073	764473	They are killing it.
764573	767775	Final Fantasy 7 football, I bet, will be next year's announcement.
767815	768315	What do you think?
769996	772558	It looks like some folks in the chat room are getting buffer tonight.
772918	776940	Guys, I'm sure we're getting bombarded with people tonight, which is amazing.
776980	778321	Thank you guys for supporting the show.
778361	780562	Don't forget it will be on our podcast stream a little later.
781743	782283	Let's see.
784665	787686	Somebody had said something about Guitar Room Man.
788687	790288	I want to say it was Xander here.
791656	796459	Xander C says, I restarted at least three times accidentally on the original Guitar-O-Man because I couldn't pause.
796819	798580	So that new feature will come in handy.
798660	803303	Xander also says, Final Fantasy Versus XIII is being made by the Kingdom Hearts 2 team.
803343	803983	That's correct.
804343	805564	It's a joint production.
805584	806825	Yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy.
806845	807785	But here's the thing, dude.
808046	810467	That's all we know about Final Fantasy Versus XIII.
810487	811708	The trailer didn't tell us shit.
811988	818712	It tells you that there's a main male character who has psychic Miss Cleo gone way wrong abilities and that's about it.
819252	819812	All right, anyway.
820333	822214	Throw a gunblade.
822294	823855	In the original Final Fantasy XIII, yes.
824495	824876	Yeah.
825116	830659	And then there's a Final Fantasy XIII mobile, but I'm not even going to go there because I'll cry.
830720	831220	Loki!
832040	832701	Something interesting.
833392	834833	Um, well, let's see here.
835493	838114	Um, I did, of course, also play the Wii.
838374	839595	I got to play Red Steel.
840675	842616	And that was okay, actually.
843096	850159	I don't know, I'm still kind of... It's the first time I've played it, and I thought that the controls were way too sensitive.
850540	850800	Like...
851580	855445	It was very awkward playing it, and it did not feel natural.
855905	866957	And if I were a very judgmental mom buying this for my kids, I would probably be turned away by it if it's going to stay like this.
867438	871262	Because it wasn't easy, but...
871983	876887	There were other games that were also being shown, like WarioWare, which was really awesome.
877007	879709	I mean, just what they're doing with the controller is amazing.
880289	882191	What you would expect from a WarioWare game.
883432	892739	Overall, though, the Wii stuff, I did play Red Steel, I played a WarioWare, and this kind of like obstacle course tech demo thing.
893339	896662	And each one very sensitive as far as the control scheme goes.
897462	900985	Now, Loki and DarkSakura, I didn't spend a lot of time at Nintendo's booth today.
901005	901826	It was so crowded.
901926	903207	I hate their layout this year.
903367	904928	I think the layout is ass.
905308	906850	It's like a claustrophobic nightmare.
907230	912674	I'm sorry, Nintendo, but having that huge dome in the middle, that was a horrible idea.
912894	918019	But tell us about, for those, because a lot of folks listening aren't going to E3, how is Nintendo's booth set up?
918079	919340	How did you guys get in there?
919440	920741	What happens when you get in there?
921181	927685	Well, you're around basically the surrounding wall when you're in line and you go in, and it's like a spiral.
927905	929286	They have these talking walls.
929326	936771	They're like walls of pictures of people sitting in white rooms or whatever, but they actually have a camera and can talk to you, and they have the voice of Mario there.
936851	939333	Yeah, that's how we got to hear him sing.
939873	945556	But it was funny, though, because I was like, well, why do they have people mocking me in line as I'm waiting?
945657	946277	But I don't know.
946357	947758	It was interesting, a little bit different.
947818	949379	I don't know what the point was, but...
949810	954492	There was one of those guys that was very knowledgeable and kept giving a lot of really good information.
955232	959933	It was sort of like having a rep there to talk with you while you're in line to sort of hype you up to go see it.
961254	970817	But once you got in, you circled around and went on this raised platform with sort of half of it covered in a picture on one side and the other side.
971337	972858	And then there were three in the middle.
973838	977381	and three widescreen TVs and different people were playing different games.
977401	980983	There's another one on the wall, but that was sort of for when they did the drum demo.
981263	981984	Yeah.
982064	987807	But when we went through there, Koji Kondo was playing the orchestra game and I got his autograph.
988208	988648	Sweet.
989168	990529	That made me very, very happy.
990549	992891	Was that orchestra thing actually a game or just a demo?
992911	993311	It's a game.
993771	994232	It's a demo.
995373	997554	I thought they said it was going to... It's a tech demo.
999335	1000276	Well, I guess we will see.
1000396	1000676	All right.
1003978	1004758	Ah, shut up.
1005519	1007599	If I wanted your opinion, I'd turn your mic on.
1007759	1018102	Because they had a series of demo games playable and they were bringing out different ones as though they were going to be released later on as packaged items.
1018963	1020383	At least as far as I was led to believe.
1020563	1027933	Well, looking at what they were talking about yesterday during the press conference is that they have this Wii Sports thing.
1027973	1031257	And it actually looks like a collection of a bunch of small games.
1032158	1037705	Almost like, remember the first Nintendo system where they had it packaged with Mario and Duck Hunt?
1038566	1055562	they would have a bunch of small tech demo things that kind of almost orient you to this new control scheme so they have the baseball, golf, tennis and a pilot wings type of game which is very kind of different Bobby, a second interesting thing you saw today
1057659	1058480	Blink, blink, blink, blink.
1061663	1065887	The sensitive controls of Sonic the Hedgehog on the PS3.
1066047	1067128	Wasn't that weird?
1067328	1068769	It made me cry.
1069350	1071872	I was not a fan of Sonic on PS3, I have to admit.
1074214	1076016	Do you know how many times I fell off the edge?
1076036	1077417	Yeah, I watched.
1077497	1080220	It had so much potential to be good, and...
1080967	1084968	And I can see Jamie getting motion sickness from that, just because of the way it was jumping around.
1085548	1086889	I left it with a headache.
1087269	1091090	I mean, I felt nauseous and had a headache, and on top of that, my heart was broken.
1091790	1093171	So, thank you, Sony.
1094311	1096412	Well, do you think the Xbox version will be just as bad?
1097148	1098729	That's in the Sega booth, we'll have to check.
1098909	1100210	Yeah, we'll have to look tomorrow.
1100250	1103473	I'm going to find out, and if it is, then I'll blame Sega, and I'll go cry there.
1103553	1110358	I played the one in the Sega booth, and the controls, the camera kind of was pissing me off, and I couldn't figure out how to play.
1110379	1112080	I was playing the Silver Sonic one.
1112340	1115583	They had two different levels, one as Sonic, one as Silver Sonic.
1115843	1123309	Silver Sonic being like Super Duper Super Saiyan Sonic with psycho, you know, kinetic powers and crap, so I don't know.
1123769	1132597	Now, one of the things I do want to mention about the PS3 controller, because we got to actually see it and play it, that a lot of people don't realize, because you've never really seen a good look of it.
1132998	1136000	And yes, the PlayStation Circle button in the middle is touchable.
1136040	1137261	It didn't do anything in what we had.
1137702	1143107	But the L2 and the R2 buttons are now like the triggers on the Xbox.
1143147	1144208	They're not straight buttons.
1144268	1145329	They are actually, you know...
1146221	1147722	analog triggers.
1147742	1148862	I thought that was kind of interesting.
1150483	1151383	I missed my number two.
1151443	1154345	My number two thing I thought was interesting today would be Luminous Live.
1154825	1159607	It's way back in the corner of the very crowded Microsoft booth, but oh my god.
1159967	1163128	It's just Luminous on the TV.
1164069	1164829	That's all I wanted.
1165149	1165509	It's great.
1166470	1170431	I mean, and if this is only going to be five bucks, I'm betting it'll probably be 800 points, not 400.
1170472	1170832	But even then, I...
1174807	1175587	Thanks for watching!
1190894	1192796	Any of you other guys go to Microsoft's booth today?
1193476	1197040	It sounds like you guys spent most of your day in West Hall, whereas Bobby and I are mostly in South Hall today.
1197160	1201824	I saw a Viva Pinata, the demo, the presentation of Viva Pinata in there.
1202264	1209230	And it's like, let's see, Animal Crossing meets Harvest Moon meets Spore meets some other stuff probably.
1209691	1210592	It's kind of the way it looked.
1210612	1212834	And I still don't know really what it is.
1213714	1215135	Remind me to look for Spore tomorrow.
1215435	1217876	It's all in EA's stuff.
1217896	1219077	We've totally missed EA today.
1219437	1220717	We'll definitely have more tomorrow.
1220737	1228441	Didn't they say they were going to have a new Need for Speed game?
1228541	1231482	I was looking for that today, but I didn't see it at all.
1231542	1233603	Was it Need for Speed Carbon, I think?
1236727	1239609	One more interesting thing you saw today, DarkSakura.
1240169	1241711	I know you're typing in chat right now.
1242111	1244232	Oh, you're arguing with somebody about graphics versus gameplay?
1244252	1245413	That pisses me off so much.
1247274	1250356	What I just said is I don't want a pretty game that plays like crap.
1251217	1254179	A system that's only as good as the games that are on it?
1255079	1255500	Exactly.
1256140	1258702	I said that to a Sony rep today and he just sort of blinked at me.
1260308	1260868	It was funny.
1260928	1262449	Why does that not surprise me?
1263349	1265990	No, he blinked, and he thought about it, because you know you're right.
1267091	1267331	Alright.
1267571	1275114	Alright, anyway, my number one, and actually my list has been about equal, but I have to say Sonic Rivals on PSP.
1275594	1275814	Yeah?
1276635	1277335	I loved it.
1277415	1281097	Oh my god, it was like everything that I loved about Sonic with Racing Shadow.
1282337	1285478	And it was like playing a 2D Sonic, but 3D.
1285959	1286159	It was...
1288055	1291919	Just fast and great, and I just had the most fun, and then they gave me a t-shirt that I can't wear.
1293120	1294302	It's like three sizes too big.
1294322	1295122	Well, that's cool.
1295142	1296724	Does Sega have a theater this year?
1297405	1299287	I didn't see, I don't think so.
1299767	1305133	I'm going to explore Sega in more detail tomorrow, but I was just like, I'm...
1306761	1309082	It's a really good Sonic game on PS3.
1309162	1312584	I mean, it's only one level I got to play, but if the whole thing's like that, I'm all over that.
1313345	1326512	I mean, it's just all the fast, fun stuff I liked about Sonic, and I didn't get to see too much more than just what they had on demo, but I'm hoping that there's a multiplayer race, because you have first place, second place.
1326532	1328413	I would assume you can do more characters.
1328493	1332455	I mean, it'd be sort of Sonic R, just on a side-scrolling level.
1333396	1334136	I think it's pretty cool.
1334616	1334897	Loki!
1336497	1344061	I played Dead Rising.
1345081	1348923	That game is really fun.
1349644	1356327	You basically put in the Dawn of the Dead scenario with you can do anything.
1356827	1359109	I was picking up pots, smashing the people.
1359409	1361671	I ate a pie.
1362432	1369617	I was playing around with the ServBot masks and stuck one on a zombie and smashed it with a sledgehammer.
1372099	1375021	That game is going to be endless hours of fun for me.
1375141	1378344	It's so gory, but really fun.
1380125	1382147	I'm definitely getting it when it comes out.
1382587	1382947	Awesome.
1383528	1384549	Bobby, you got one more?
1385816	1391859	Well, I mean, it's not as interesting as what everybody else played, because like I said, I didn't get to play the Wii, which is what I would be talking about.
1392259	1395400	But we actually looked at the new .hack game.
1396421	1397401	I was actually thinking about that.
1397461	1400042	Yeah, the .hack, it's what, GU or something like that?
1400062	1400143	Yeah.
1400183	1400903	I don't remember what it was.
1401703	1402925	It's like Rebirth or something.
1402945	1406528	Right, but it looks like it's going to be another episodic.
1406768	1409931	The guy that I talked to didn't know what price it was going to be or anything.
1410512	1413194	But it looked more the same.
1413234	1423984	Now, it did have a lot more animations and stuff, and I actually got the typical anime where it shows the three main characters in a split-screen view for half a second, then they all go crazy and everything goes red.
1424005	1426167	But the demo, I wish it was longer.
1426787	1430309	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1453444	1456427	Um, gosh, what should I do for my last interesting thing?
1456548	1458710	I'm gonna say, uh, Phantasy Star Universe.
1458730	1465116	Phantasy Star Universe, uh, I got to play it on PC, which looked superior to the PS2 one I saw.
1465136	1465176	Um...
1467093	1472417	It's great because they didn't change a lot of the Phantasy Star online formula.
1472477	1474398	They just made it a little better.
1475378	1477420	You can do a little more super attacks.
1477560	1481082	It looked like he had some more tactical points kind of thing.
1481522	1484284	You can only do so many power hits in a row.
1484564	1486485	So you can't just keep boring those power hits.
1486726	1488487	But you can actually get in a fourth hit.
1488687	1488947	Thanks.
1489227	1493549	I think Phantasy Star Universe is going to be, if you guys are on Phantasy Star Online, it's going to be great for you guys.
1493849	1498391	Unfortunately, the only disappointment I have with that is that they weren't showing the 360 version.
1498971	1500452	So that kind of made me a little sad.
1501724	1504426	Alright, so I guess we all got our interesting things out.
1504526	1505988	I got a wacky question.
1507108	1508229	Can we take calls?
1508470	1509010	Yes, you can.
1509030	1509610	Can we do calls?
1509751	1509891	Yes.
1509931	1510711	Give out the number, Bobby.
1510791	1513954	Okay, well you can either use... Do we have both Skype and the toll-free number?
1515175	1517857	Give out the toll-free number, because you don't want to have to have all those people on Skype.
1518197	1518858	Okay.
1518878	1520019	The toll-free number is 1-866-880-0156.
1520299	1525844	That's a toll-free number here in the United States.
1525864	1526704	Go ahead and put that in chat.
1526744	1530327	Lawrence, one call at a time, though, because when we get like two people on the line, I get crazy.
1530748	1530848	So...
1531488	1535050	All right, real quick, though, while we're waiting for some calls.
1535911	1540814	Booth Babes, big controversy, and there really weren't a whole lot on the show for this year.
1540854	1544417	I saw some on that Final Fantasy, and I remember I turned to you and I'm like, $5,000?
1545437	1547078	Well, they were Mithra girls, though.
1547098	1548999	They were more cosplayers than Booth Babes.
1549580	1550060	What do you think?
1550160	1551901	Is the show different without Booth Babes?
1552122	1553182	I didn't notice they weren't there.
1553683	1555604	I didn't notice, nor did I miss, nor did I care.
1556818	1574160	I didn't really notice either, and I hope I don't come off sounding like the token gay guy of the show saying that, but I just... I really didn't change the show, because the show's about the games, not about that scenery, and people were going in to see the games anyway.
1574440	1574820	What was that?
1575360	1578101	Somebody had come up with a creative substitute for the booth babes.
1578221	1580462	What were you guys talking about in the bus?
1580522	1582002	We were talking about the Transformers.
1582022	1583302	I don't know if that was Lawrence.
1583382	1588924	Yeah, there's an Optimus Prime in one of the booths, and there's no Transformers game in there, but it got him in the booth.
1589304	1591565	There was a banner for the Transformers movie.
1592485	1593365	Oh, is that what it was?
1593465	1593845	Yeah.
1594225	1594966	Oh, Savages.
1595626	1596286	Savages.
1596366	1596866	Savages.
1596906	1597706	Bunch of Savages.
1597926	1598667	Where's my game?
1600589	1601110	Alright.
1601230	1603572	They did a Transformers game and it wasn't very good.
1603592	1605514	They've done several and they've all been wrong.
1607674	1608474	PlayStation 3.
1610035	1612995	It sounds like we all got to play PlayStation 3 today.
1613195	1617896	Did your impressions of the PlayStation 3 go up from the Sony conference?
1618236	1619356	Were you disappointed?
1619816	1620376	What did you think?
1620496	1621777	DarkSakura, I'll go ahead and start with you.
1622057	1636179	I also played Gran Turismo HD and it was like another Gran Turismo and it was pretty but honestly I also saw that Heavenly Blade
1637878	1639781	My opinion still remains the same.
1639841	1641744	Sony shot themselves... It's actually Heavenly Sword.
1641884	1642906	Heavenly Sword, sorry.
1643066	1646051	I'm thinking of Dancing Blade, which is another PlayStation game.
1649491	1657739	I still think that they've shot themselves in the foot and this time with having not the best of games to show for it.
1658219	1659240	We have a caller on the line.
1659701	1660601	Okay.
1660661	1662283	Finish your thought, then I'll say hello to the caller.
1663064	1664485	It was crap then and crap now.
1664845	1666166	Alright.
1666707	1669529	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio live at the E3 Outpost.
1669569	1669930	Who's this?
1671625	1672426	The Ichiban Crush!
1672766	1676728	The Ichiban Crush, one of my very favorite posters on the forums.
1677768	1678648	What's on your mind, buddy?
1679489	1689354	Yo, so, I'm looking at the E3 news on Monday and see the price announcement for PS3.
1690314	1700379	I can't help but wonder myself, man, but, I mean, I know this is Blu-ray and you're not going to, you just cannot get any cheaper than that, but is this thing really going to sell, yo?
1701161	1703482	Um, here's my thing with PlayStation 3.
1704003	1711646	Sony has really yet to explain why their console is worth 200 more bucks than Xbox 360.
1711967	1717049	And in playing the demos today, I mean, for instance, Sonic, Sonic is a game that's on Xbox 360.
1717429	1719671	Why do I need to invest the extra money in the PlayStation 3?
1720211	1721932	However, to PlayStation 3's credits...
1722512	1726095	They do have a grip on some of the real great franchises.
1726115	1730700	That Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer is, you know, fanboy, boner-inducing.
1731080	1737026	Final Fantasy XIII, I mean, you know, I'm a big Final Fantasy fan, so of course I'm like, oh, oh god.
1737406	1743872	And, you know, they've got games that I think are going to cater to the fanboys.
1744272	1747575	You know, but they're still, for the average gamer...
1748576	1756523	Microsoft's in a great position right now because their system is cheaper and it's at glance right now seems to do the same thing as PlayStation 3.
1756903	1763369	What was missing from that conference for me was that Sony didn't tell me why I needed Blu-ray.
1763970	1765411	Does anybody else have thoughts on that?
1765831	1766531	Well, I don't know.
1766551	1772393	I've actually played Final Fantasy XII, and if that's any indication of what Final Fantasy XIII is going to be, then I'm better off without it.
1772953	1774933	I love Final Fantasy XII a whole lot.
1774953	1778774	Final Fantasy XII had the single worst combat system ever.
1778874	1781935	It took the stuff that was good about Grandia and made it crap.
1781995	1783815	We agree to disagree there, I suppose.
1785156	1786896	Like, what was with that whole line business?
1788576	1790537	Xander C in chat doesn't like Microsoft.
1790557	1793818	Xander C says Microsoft has yet to show why their console is worth more than $150.
1797047	1802150	The stuff they're doing with Arcade and Gears of War is incredible.
1803571	1805212	Guys, I know how you feel.
1805893	1812057	If you had told me four years ago I would be here saying positive things about Microsoft, I would have said you're full of shit.
1812277	1813878	Are we watching Lost Planet right now?
1813918	1814999	Yes, this is Lost Planet.
1815139	1816120	That looks really good.
1816160	1820883	This is one reason why this console is worth the money that it is.
1821443	1824325	Lost Planet right here, Capcom really has
1826867	1828069	I'll be honest with you, Sky
1848263	1855907	I'm really, really worried about this whole upcoming next gen, just mainly because of Sony.
1855967	1863671	I don't think it's going to cause another crash like everyone's been saying for the past two decades, but
1864679	1865179	I don't know.
1865239	1867441	I'm just not feeling it this time around.
1867641	1871544	Not the way I was with the 16-bit, 32-bit eras.
1872125	1883814	You know, it's a different battle this time because the battle is not just about the games, but it's about getting that console in your living room so you can get the music and the on-demand movies and all this other stuff.
1883834	1886396	That's a factor that we've never had to really deal with before.
1886836	1889318	So I think that's kind of what makes a lot of this very interesting.
1889818	1890018	So...
1890859	1891582	But yeah, you're right.
1892285	1894976	This one is too hard to tell because look at Japan.
1896547	1898569	Xbox has really yet to catch on there.
1898589	1902152	Is it going to catch wildfire after E3?
1902292	1902752	I don't know.
1902872	1904734	It's hard for me to say.
1905894	1910838	I think what would be most interesting about this is if Microsoft ends up on top here in the U.S.
1910858	1912680	And again, I'm purely speculating, guys.
1912740	1915061	Please don't take this as my opinion on what's going to happen or whatever.
1915382	1917323	But what if Microsoft's on top here in the U.S.
1917363	1919265	and then Sony's on top in Japan?
1919525	1920445	Wouldn't that be something?
1920465	1921186	Yeah.
1921614	1925237	That means that we're still going to get another crappy PlayStation later on.
1926057	1929399	I hope Sony's taking the feedback.
1930060	1933963	It seems like they did it before when everybody bitched about the Boomerang controller.
1934003	1936664	They went back and changed it, so hopefully Sony's listening this time.
1937005	1937325	Who knows?
1937945	1939907	The boomerang just looks uncomfortable.
1940567	1943549	I have a controller that likes the boomerang.
1943589	1945050	It's not good.
1945731	1949513	Ichimon Crush, you know I love you, but I gotta let you go so we can get more cars in, alright?
1949574	1950194	Absolutely.
1950214	1951415	Thanks, guys.
1951435	1952055	Thanks for calling.
1952776	1953416	Y'all have a good one.
1953556	1954117	Alright, you too.
1955232	1963076	One thing I want to add before he called was about, you were talking about Gran Turismo, and a lot of people probably looked at the demo and they're like, oh, that's so cool, the people move.
1963356	1966777	Well, I'm going to tell you right now, they are still 2D paper people.
1967318	1977722	I looked, and, you know, the people, because that's one of the things a lot of people have about the Gran Turismo series is that the people look like they're like 2D pieces of paper, and they still are in that early demo.
1977862	1978282	Listen.
1978703	1981084	I played the Tokyo track, and it... I'm gonna...
1982024	2005242	we're gonna go to another call guys hi you're on orange launch radio live at e3 outpost who's this hello this is nintendo maniac 64 or uh bad starter maniac hi nintendo maniac 64 how you doing um i'm ecstatic over the cold freeze thing because i'm all the way in the east coast you're ecstatic about the what oh the freeze going on right now
2006164	2007104	Yeah.
2007144	2007624	What's going on?
2007664	2008765	Is the weather nuts or something?
2009685	2012146	It's been kind of hot.
2012246	2014727	It's been kind of hot recently.
2016387	2017507	Well, tell us about E3.
2017567	2019208	What are your thoughts on E3 so far?
2020508	2027470	The one thing that caught my attention actually was in Nintendo's press conference when they were showing the CS game, they showed Diddy Kong Racing.
2027571	2031992	They happened to show Snowball Valley from the original on there, which was interesting.
2033645	2041890	I... You've got a good eye, because honestly, I was one of those people that didn't really care about Diddy Kong Racing because I was too distracted by the thoughts of Star Fox on the DS.
2042490	2045031	Because they kind of showed that all at once, and I was like, ooh, Star Fox!
2045432	2046953	Ah, fuck Diddy Kong, I want Star Fox!
2047073	2048714	Diddy Kong Racing sucked anyways.
2049654	2052536	Well, that's... No, this is Nintendo Maniac, so he might have a different opinion.
2052916	2054037	So... Alright.
2054717	2056378	You got any questions for us, Nintendo Maniac?
2057359	2058720	Um... Um...
2062802	2067527	Oh, yeah, um, you... Oh, you know what, never mind on that question.
2067867	2068147	Alright.
2068487	2068708	Okay.
2068728	2070229	Let's see, is there anything else?
2071290	2074713	Oh, how long did you have to wait to get to play Twilight Princess?
2075074	2075754	To get to play what?
2076675	2078257	To get to play Twilight Princess.
2079017	2080238	I can't... Twilight Princess.
2080379	2083682	Oh, Twilight Princess, uh... Um, I waited about 30 to 45 minutes.
2085609	2086270	Thanks for watching!
2105751	2110833	Yeah, see, it takes about an hour to two and a half hours from what they told me to get into the Wii area.
2111493	2113614	And then you've got to wait behind people.
2113674	2115175	It's just normal kiosk once you get in there.
2116555	2118616	All right, Nintendo Maniacs64, thanks so much for the call.
2118636	2119956	We're going to go ahead and let you go, buddy, okay?
2120436	2120717	Okay.
2120737	2121497	All right, have a good one.
2122217	2124258	All right, we're going to take one more call.
2124318	2125458	Let's see who we got.
2127299	2128620	Lawrence Young, the man on the controls.
2128660	2129640	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2130984	2132625	Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.
2133305	2135366	SSJ100 Matt, what's on your mind, buddy?
2135386	2136066	Thanks for the call.
2136106	2136546	What's going on?
2137767	2142129	Hey, I was wondering what you guys thought of the new test, the new test numbers on SSJ100.
2143276	2144017	Super Smash Bros.
2172956	2174657	from Metal Gear Solid.
2174877	2175997	That is crazy.
2176157	2177518	Pit from Kid Icarus.
2177578	2179599	Yay!
2180239	2186262	Nintendo, thank you for finally fucking acknowledging this game you've ignored for the past like 20 years.
2187276	2190097	You have Wario as going to be another one.
2190517	2192658	And also Zero Suit Samus.
2193618	2194398	That's pretty hot.
2194458	2195919	Which was pretty interesting.
2196179	2197459	And then there was one more.
2198479	2200840	I want to say... Oh, God.
2201400	2201780	I don't remember.
2201800	2203241	Some metal robot thing.
2203661	2209062	But one of the very interesting things that's on here, they show one of the attacks.
2209342	2210503	And what's one of the attacks?
2210603	2212683	But a Nintendog licking the screen.
2212743	2213204	Oh, Jesus.
2213224	2214004	He's so puppy.
2215100	2215681	You guys.
2215861	2216923	Snake has his box.
2216983	2217284	All right.
2217665	2218827	That's great.
2218987	2221832	SSJ100, Matt, we've got to wrap up, but thanks so much for the call, all right?
2222954	2223235	All right.
2223295	2223956	Have a good one, buddy.
2224056	2224296	All right.
2226212	2227673	So that's going to be our last call for the night.
2227713	2232355	We're going to wrap up so that we can get out of here so all games interactive can take over for a little bit.
2233256	2235897	Oh, no, I'm getting the stretch it out sign.
2236298	2237318	Okay, never mind then, we won't.
2238719	2245523	Comments from chat room, Boss Tone, Toshin, they all want to know, Dance Dance TV, what the hell do we think of this?
2246043	2247184	If you guys didn't hear...
2247924	2248324	What is it?
2248705	2251267	Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, because I was reading about this late last night.
2251588	2255411	CBS Television is optioned Dance Dance TV, right?
2255632	2255872	Yeah.
2256112	2261838	And Dance Dance TV is going to be a show that's going to be, what, the Saturday morning slumber party on CBS or something like that?
2262638	2267383	I don't know, and I'm kind of afraid to even consider wanting to know.
2267523	2277000	What I picked up on it is that it's like it's supposed to be teams of kids competing against each other and it's inspired by DDR or something like that.
2277100	2278623	So you know what guys?
2280560	2285884	From Konami's perspective, it's all about whatever's gonna sell more games, right?
2286864	2288325	I don't see this as a bad thing.
2288406	2289326	Am I gonna watch it?
2289806	2290327	Fuck no.
2290847	2293849	But am I gonna hate it just because it's out there?
2294190	2294390	No.
2294830	2297692	I understand we gotta do crazy things to promote our stuff sometimes.
2297752	2302555	I don't think it's a bad thing, and I don't think it's gonna make DDR look stupid because...
2304136	2315042	Honestly, if somebody were to come up to me and tell me, dude, you're playing that DDR game that's on a little girl's morning TV show, I would say, dude, you were watching Saturday morning TV for little girls.
2318484	2318864	I don't know.
2319044	2319804	It looks stupid.
2319984	2324947	I'm not watching it, but I don't know.
2324987	2329349	Xander C in chatroom says they're a little late to be making a DDR TV show.
2329389	2331150	They should have tried that back in 2002.
2331750	2332831	Remember DDR the movie?
2334039	2336740	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2355290	2356351	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2376707	2384294	Well, this, I was a little surprised that the games that are on it, they have the NES versions of the games.
2384314	2393604	They have the Nintendo version of Strider, which was, I don't like it, because it's that whole story thing based off of the old Strider manga that was out a few years ago.
2394404	2394504	Um...
2395365	2410793	I would much rather have them do, like, you know, a Mega Drive collection where we have, you know, like, the actual Arcade Strider and, you know, actual Arcade Final Fight in this, you know, because the PSP could easily do it, but these are Nintendo... This is going to be random, but I forgot to tell you, Strider's on GameCapt now.
2412013	2412433	I need that.
2412493	2413854	Pretty hot, huh?
2413874	2415255	You told me yesterday.
2415335	2425860	Now, Jamie, did you see that they had that Capcom Classic Collection Mini that's going to be on the Game Boy Advance, which has Strider and Bionic Commando?
2425960	2430243	Well, the other game that was on the PSP thing was Bionic Commando.
2430643	2431083	Excellent.
2431683	2437526	And honestly, I love Mighty Final Fight, but I have that on Nintendo.
2437847	2439007	I have all those on Nintendo.
2439027	2440028	I can just play them on Nintendo.
2441001	2441922	and so on.
2458084	2461927	around Capcom and Sega and Namco, Bondi tomorrow.
2461987	2462847	Alright.
2462887	2464649	Going to chat room for some comments here.
2464769	2470673	Rockus, OLRRockus wants to know in chat.allgames.com, song list updates for the DDRs, anyone?
2471173	2475536	Honestly, I'm going to be honest with you, check DDRFreak.com or BomaniStyle.com, I'm sure they have it up.
2476437	2488888	I know I played Precious, some remix of Precious by Depeche Mode in the Universe one, and I played Listen to Your Heart in Ultramix 4, and I played Since You've Been Gone on Supernova.
2489269	2494133	I did get to play Seduction in the vocal mix now, which is in Supernova in the arcade.
2494393	2494674	Sweet.
2495726	2497207	Actually, I did want to issue a challenge.
2497587	2497848	Okay.
2498308	2505393	If any of our listeners are at E3, I would love to meet people up at SNK to own them on King of Fighters 2006.
2506713	2508355	Awesome.
2508415	2510656	Quick programming note, just for people here on the live stream.
2510676	2512197	Sorry to you podcast folks who are here.
2512217	2513098	That's alright.
2513218	2515539	All Games Interactive will be going on after Gamer Andy.
2515579	2518221	We're not, so we're going, OLR is going to go until about 8.15.
2518261	2520263	Oh, are we really?
2520343	2520743	Okay.
2521103	2523825	So I'm letting them know at the same time instead of trying to whisper in their ear.
2524385	2546384	So yeah, but Gamer Andy, live from the Microsoft Press Conference at 8.15 And then All Games Interactive at 9.30 when they get kicked out of the Microsoft Press Conference So don't worry about ending right now, you've got a little while longer If you want to take more calls, that's cool Alright, maybe we'll do more calls in a little bit For right now though, let's finish up this thought we were going down Something you want to look at tomorrow Loki, what are you going to be doing tomorrow?
2547304	2552826	I will probably be hitting up the Sony booth because I was mainly in South Hall today.
2553486	2555026	So I need to hit up West Hall.
2555526	2559127	There's still parts of South Hall that I haven't seen so I might need to go back there.
2560167	2562148	I actually hit up a lot of the Korean booths today.
2563248	2564749	I think just because I was that bored.
2566889	2567269	I don't know.
2567849	2569550	Probably just hitting up...
2570590	2573711	Some of the games I haven't played for Sony, just trying all the new ones.
2574492	2580674	Maybe trying Nintendo again to see if I can try playing Metroid Prime 3 or something like that.
2582795	2583675	Other than that, I don't know.
2584095	2585936	Oh, I've got to check out the PSP stuff, definitely.
2586416	2589778	Yeah, I didn't do that either.
2590118	2592359	We got the call sign, so let's go to the phones.
2592899	2594780	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
2594800	2595160	Who's this?
2596257	2597577	This is SilentWind96.
2598077	2599318	Hello, SilentWind96.
2599598	2600278	What's on your mind?
2601638	2603338	Oh, just chilling here.
2603418	2605219	I'm down the street in my hotel.
2606579	2610000	Come on down.
2610160	2611260	I couldn't get a pass.
2611760	2617501	I couldn't get a temporary job at EB Games or nothing so I could get into this joint.
2617521	2618162	Wait, wait.
2618202	2619982	You couldn't get into E3 at all?
2621414	2625564	No, I don't have any credentials to get in, so I couldn't really... No, come to the outpost.
2625584	2625904	You know what?
2625985	2628029	At the outpost, you don't need a credential.
2628069	2628811	You can get in here.
2630600	2630920	Oh, really?
2630960	2632622	I'll tell you what, you know what?
2633382	2634263	I'll get you in.
2634323	2636625	We will get you in this place for free, right?
2636645	2637185	Can we do that?
2637745	2637866	Yeah.
2637886	2638106	All right.
2638146	2638866	He'll get in our meeting.
2638926	2640307	You know what?
2640327	2644110	Does he have a... Can you send somebody... How do we get him in touch with us?
2644130	2646812	Actually, you're in chat, so you just PM me your name.
2646832	2650475	Okay, I want you to send a private message to BlackWolf, and he'll get you in touch.
2650495	2650615	Okay.
2650635	2651316	Get on down here.
2651376	2652757	You can get in this place, at least.
2654500	2654881	All right.
2655501	2656741	Any questions you want to know about?
2656761	2658262	I'm so sorry to hear you didn't get in.
2658362	2661283	Anything you want to mention about the show?
2663084	2667126	Well, first of all, I love the show, guys.
2667626	2671928	I have a crappy internet connection here at the hotel, but I can at least hear the stream.
2671948	2675630	Thank you so much.
2676851	2681633	I got a DS Lite I imported recently, and I'm loving it.
2683560	2684141	How is that?
2685182	2687103	That's great.
2687183	2689425	What makes it so much better than the original DS?
2690586	2696791	Well, I've never touched the original DS, so I like this, and it looked really cool.
2696851	2704877	I found it on eBay, and I blew away Scott and Lawrence, and I told them I got it for $99 off of eBay.
2705317	2705657	Wow.
2706258	2709220	They actually had this for their demo units for...
2710968	2717076	It was some really awful card game, but I have to say that I enjoyed the brighter screen on it.
2717937	2719299	It felt a little bit easier.
2720472	2721273	Yeah, that's right.
2721593	2721953	All right.
2722273	2725155	Well, SilentWind96, we'll see you in a little bit.
2725215	2728618	And you're getting the hookup, man, because this is an invite-only party tonight here.
2728858	2729538	In television.
2729919	2733061	The Mario Rock Opera is... Mario Rock Opera is setting up.
2733081	2735303	They've got a whole DJ thing down there.
2735323	2736904	Yeah, Supernova Sound.
2737204	2739846	In television everywhere, but there's new stuff too.
2739926	2742087	But, I mean, who doesn't love these classics?
2742107	2742528	It's great.
2742728	2743909	Get your butt down here right now.
2745009	2745329	1-866-880-0156 1-866-880-0156
2765609	2769330	And don't call in asking to get in free tonight because we just gave our one away.
2769450	2770390	So that's it.
2770550	2770971	We're done.
2771851	2772811	But here's the good news.
2772851	2778212	You can come Thursday or Friday and you can get in and it's a good time.
2778352	2782093	So if you still want to come down, Thursday and Friday we'll be here as well because we're taping both nights.
2782954	2783794	Where do we leave off?
2784614	2787116	Bobby, oh, Bobby's on the phone, so I'll go.
2787276	2788878	One thing I want to see tomorrow.
2789358	2793181	I didn't freaking touch the Wii, so I guess I'm going to have to wait in that.
2793361	2794342	You want to touch the Wii?
2794422	2797364	I want to touch Nintendo's Wii so bad.
2797765	2801448	So I'm going to wait in that horrible line and just...
2802068	2806109	Get it over with so I can say I played the damn Wii so I can come here and tell you all about it.
2806149	2808170	So that's essentially my day.
2808290	2811411	Otherwise, I didn't see anything in West Hall besides Sony.
2811691	2815672	And I know Tecmo's over there, and I know there's other booths over there I want to check out.
2816533	2825195	I would suggest going by Atlas for Disgaea 2 and Kalei, of course, for Guitar Man Lives.
2825616	2827576	I want to play their Fatal Inertia also.
2827596	2829497	Yeah.
2829517	2829557	Um...
2831089	2834172	Let's see, I'm going to go over to chat here and see what's going on here.
2834272	2838817	TigerClaw wants to know, are we going to be able to hear the Mario Rock Opera tonight as well?
2839537	2843902	I think unfortunately they don't because GamerAndy is going to be live somewhere else right at that moment, right?
2844122	2845784	Well, that was what that phone call was.
2846124	2846464	Oh, really?
2847245	2848226	They're not going to be live.
2848306	2850728	They cannot get it to work on Microsoft servers.
2850748	2851749	They're going to still record.
2851810	2853912	I apologize to all of GamerAndy's fans in chat.
2854192	2854272	Oh!
2854572	2857234	There are some in there, so all games interactive will be going on.
2857854	2860395	And they'll still have the show up on their podcast feed.
2860515	2863037	Well, okay, so the GamerAndy fans still have that.
2863217	2865938	Right, and GamerAndy will be here tomorrow night.
2867119	2870661	Nice guy, GamerAndy, and he's got quite a clique.
2870681	2871361	They've got eight people.
2871422	2872882	He's got a huge entourage.
2873022	2876164	GamerAndy.com And they've got the hookup.
2876184	2877025	They play Gears of War.
2877825	2882788	I was talking to Andy because they got behind closed doors at Microsoft and they played Gears of War and they said it was awesome.
2882808	2884268	I was there when they were getting it.
2884309	2885429	Yeah.
2885469	2886890	Major Nelson's on their show tonight, right?
2886970	2888731	I believe so, yeah.
2888751	2892493	And we were trying to rig it to get it to work and they just can't get it to work on their Wi-Fi over there.
2892513	2893593	Frickin' technology.
2893713	2893934	Yeah.
2894134	2894474	Alright.
2895194	2897596	Bobby, what are you looking forward to doing tomorrow at the show?
2897656	2897776	We...
2899517	2899837	Wee, that's all.
2900298	2901999	You're going to go wee, wee, wee all the way home?
2902339	2903400	No, just in the morning.
2903580	2905562	Just going to go over there and wait, whatever, the two hours.
2905582	2907343	You're going to go over and wee in West Hall in the morning?
2907363	2907623	Yeah.
2907683	2908064	Alright, yeah.
2908184	2909285	Yeah, I'm going directly there.
2909305	2911526	Right in the center of Nintendo's booth, I'm going to wee.
2911646	2913127	Yeah, I'm going to go play with my wee.
2913588	2915189	Because I really want to play the conducting game.
2915790	2918752	And that drum demo, you know, the virtual drum.
2918792	2922094	Because, I mean, I'm a musician, and I want to see if I'm any better at Miyamoto.
2923155	2924075	DarkSakura wants to address chat.
2949680	2953144	I didn't look too deep into the DS area, honestly.
2953645	2957189	So I will go hunt out anything on Fire Emblem tomorrow I can.
2957290	2959132	I know lots of people are interested in that series.
2959292	2960033	I love the series.
2960093	2961575	I can't play it for crap, but I love the series.
2962316	2964679	So I will look up Fire Emblem stuff for y'all tomorrow.
2968365	2972126	HitStun in chat right now is questioning is Super Smash Bros.
2972166	2975827	this new one a real game or was it just a whole fan service thing?
2976127	2978028	No, they have pictures from the conference.
2978088	2979988	With Miyamoto in the pictures?
2980008	2981349	Yeah, I would think it's real.
2981649	2983169	Oh, okay.
2984309	2986130	They say it in chat, I say it out loud.
2986170	2986890	You know, that's what we do.
2986910	2992672	They even have this cool little montage where Snake is talking to Ocelot or whatever, you know, whatever his name is.
2992832	2993312	Otacon.
2993572	2993992	Otacon.
2994252	2997653	See, listen, I don't play Metal Gear Solid, so that's why I'm going to butcher everything.
2997913	3003016	All I know is it's a game by a guy named Solid Snake, and that's as far as I go.
3003416	3008119	Folks in chat want to know about Excite Truck.
3008759	3009840	You guys saw it, I didn't.
3009860	3011061	What do you think about Excite Truck?
3011261	3012482	I want that game.
3012862	3016584	It looks like it scores like Burnout.
3016724	3017825	It's very interesting.
3017905	3021867	The truck is extremely fast, so it's kind of like Excite Bike a little bit.
3023368	3024869	Just very interesting.
3024969	3029813	I don't know, no one seemed to be able to keep their truck on the road, but it looked fun.
3030073	3031594	I like the way they do their scoring system.
3031634	3039340	It's kind of like Burnout, where you get points for, you know, driving dangerously, catching a lot of air, going fast, being in first place, and that stuff.
3039380	3046325	And they'll give you a ranking on the race, everything from, like, D to AAA, S, I don't know.
3046886	3050408	And they did say, though, that it wasn't, you weren't going to be able to do anything online with it.
3051969	3052670	It's kind of dumb.
3053676	3058180	I'm hoping that they have the whole, you know, build a level, save it, take it to your friend's house.
3058200	3060081	Nintendo needs to do online, dammit.
3060721	3061642	Get with the program.
3063864	3073131	They did have Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam there, and I didn't get to play that, or Tony Hawk's Project 8, which I have no idea what the hell Project 8 is, but, um, I don't know.
3073731	3074131	Should be good.
3075112	3081497	Project Hammer was another game that they had at the Wii booths, and, um,
3083629	3085772	I'm not very interested in that game, to be honest.
3087114	3088055	They had a Sonic game, though.
3088676	3090799	Sonic, uh... What was it?
3091179	3091640	Wildfire?
3092841	3093222	How was that?
3094143	3094603	I didn't play it.
3094623	3095565	It looked good, though.
3095965	3098368	What was it?
3098568	3099249	They had Bomberman.
3101691	3102592	and the Virtual Console.
3102952	3103793	Super Monkey Ball.
3103813	3104953	They had the Virtual Console.
3105013	3106815	The Virtual Console is sexy.
3106855	3108055	I want to see it all.
3108135	3109456	Tell me about Mario World.
3109496	3110537	Tell me about it.
3110597	3111177	How did it work?
3111197	3111718	How does it look?
3112098	3116621	Actually, I didn't get to check it out because I was feeling a little ill at the moment.
3117181	3121424	We will have hopefully some pictures online soon of the Virtual Console.
3121864	3130110	But in the meantime, if you are really trying to get a look at it, I believe Joystick had pictures of it online.
3130150	3132671	And I'm trying to find the link so we can put it in chat.
3134804	3135745	It looked pretty cool.
3135805	3140650	They had on demo, they actually had the Super Mario Bros.
3140770	3141991	for the Nintendo.
3142491	3153061	I think Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64, Bong for the TurboGrafx, Sonic for the Genesis, of course, and Super Nintendo.
3153221	3154742	They had Super Mario World.
3155043	3155924	Super Mario World.
3156004	3158726	So definitely really cool looking.
3161028	3164232	Yeah, it looks very solid, very sexy, very white.
3168737	3175024	Now, obviously this is not really great radio, but Rob, here's pictures of the virtual console on my laptop here.
3176005	3176887	Oh, that's pretty hot.
3176927	3177307	I like that.
3177327	3178248	Yeah, I do like that.
3178409	3180211	It's bigger than I thought.
3180271	3182374	It's on Engadget, guys, if you want to go there.
3182454	3184617	I thought it would have more games on the screen at once.
3184777	3185578	That's kind of interesting.
3186019	3187120	Yeah.
3187221	3188602	Real quick plug for the websites.
3189043	3190265	E3 on PSP.com.
3190305	3192508	Loki, you've been updating that like a mofo, right?
3192528	3192668	Uh-huh.
3192748	3193288	I've been trying.
3193329	3194570	I've been getting behind a little bit.
3194630	3200094	But I do have some stuff from actually the Nintendo party that I attended.
3200775	3200935	Oh!
3201295	3202176	Which should be good.
3202216	3204137	So we got some pictures of that.
3204397	3205518	Let's come back to that in a minute.
3205899	3207900	DarkSakura, what sites have you been working on?
3209101	3213925	Actually, I did a little blogging today on stuff.orangenilderadio.com.
3213945	3216487	Yeah, I have a backlog I'm going to post there soon, too.
3217128	3221671	I just happened to go up to the press room just to relax for a little bit and...
3223186	3226930	I figured I'd go ahead and update the stuff blog, so there's my initial impressions there.
3226991	3237022	That was everything up until I headed back, actually right before I ran into you guys, when I was coming out of the west.
3237243	3238504	I'm sorry I'm all backwards today.
3238524	3238744	I'm sorry.
3241269	3247195	So yeah, if you want to check out just what my impression was as of that moment, I have a few details there.
3247555	3250818	I had just also checked out Guitar Room Man at that point.
3251479	3259406	Also, there's a discussion going on in our LiveJournal community at...
3260527	3263968	Orange Challenge.livejournal.com You can get there.
3264809	3266649	I'm sure there's stuff going up on our MySpace.
3266729	3270171	I haven't looked at MySpace all week.
3270931	3274992	And there's various other discussions that we're involved with at different locations.
3275012	3275693	It just depends on...
3276843	3277484	We'll see you next time.
3294904	3298546	with G4 interviewing somebody in Kensho.
3298886	3302267	And we're like, is he that desperate for a paycheck?
3302527	3303608	I just rolled my eyes.
3303668	3304648	I'm just like, I don't get it.
3304748	3306449	I don't get G4 anymore, so whatever.
3306529	3307849	I saw him in South Hall.
3307910	3310771	They were making him record, I guess, a bumper or something.
3310931	3312511	He's all, I'm here at E3, man.
3312591	3315273	I was supposed to be in Alaska or something like that.
3315293	3317474	I was like, okay.
3318874	3322936	The last thing I saw him do that wasn't an animated movie was USA Up All Night.
3325256	3326557	Any other celebrity signings?
3326617	3330420	I don't know if this counts, but I got to meet Tommy Tallarico, thanks to Bobby.
3332121	3334902	And Becky Young, who's smoking.
3335282	3338765	Nice guy, but he had so much makeup on because he was doing the HD TV play.
3338785	3342087	Yeah, he did the HD, which is on VOOM, Dish Network.
3342287	3345729	He looked like, who's that guy on Dancing with the Stars?
3346289	3347030	George Hamilton?
3348208	3348809	No, I'm teasing.
3348849	3350410	He was a very nice... I'm totally teasing.
3350731	3351492	Very nice guy.
3352072	3354155	Glad to meet him.
3354215	3355556	Any other celebrity run-ins, you guys?
3356357	3360481	I got to meet... Well, I didn't get to meet him, but I saw the guy who worked on the...
3362603	3377112	DS, Castlemania Games, and then, as I'm actually showing Rob my picture right now, I had my meeting, well, not necessarily that I actually got to meet him other than to say thank you, but Koji Kondo, I got his autograph.
3377892	3387018	And I happened to be at the press line for Nintendo when they were doing an interview with Miyamoto.
3388134	3390255	You've got a lot of great pictures there, DarkSakura.
3390275	3391576	You've got to get those on the site soon.
3392176	3397419	I haven't figured out how to... Because I'm actually using my... No, no, no, I don't want to do that.
3398059	3401541	I'm actually using my camcorder as a camera, too.
3402061	3403902	And I'm trying to get the picture to show Rob.
3403942	3404263	There it is.
3405823	3409087	I got a really good picture of Miyamoto.
3423345	3427987	Go into chat room, chat.allgames.com for this week while we're live at the E3 Outpost.
3428067	3431889	Xander wants to know, did we see In The Groove 2 consumer style?
3432649	3435750	Conspicuously absent from Red Octane's booth completely.
3436871	3438391	All they have is Guitar Hero 2.
3438751	3443774	I'll give you this, their booth is 50 times better than it was last year, but it's all Guitar Hero 2.
3443834	3446295	They are not showing In The Groove in any capacity.
3446315	3449316	I didn't hear anything about the Activision deal either.
3449676	3450296	You know what?
3450416	3450996	You want to hear us?
3451457	3454918	I overheard Activision people talking about the acquisition.
3455318	3458699	As I was walking out of Kensha, I overheard Activision people talking about it.
3459239	3462520	And they were just saying, they were just very happy about it.
3462540	3467442	They were like, well, I'm glad we got them because someone was going to eventually, you know, it was basically the tone of the whole thing.
3467482	3470223	So I don't know if I was supposed to hear that, but I did.
3470363	3472944	Activision's very happy to be getting Red Octane, so...
3474833	3475434	Oh my god.
3475474	3476274	The puppies.
3476314	3479616	The puppies on IGN.com from Smash Brothers.
3480177	3480897	Oh my lord.
3481097	3486100	But I lost my train of thought.
3486220	3486741	It's alright.
3487890	3489571	Damn you for distracting me with puppy.
3489931	3490511	Sorry.
3490591	3493773	Just a quick programming note for those that are listening live.
3493833	3502097	If you're tuning in right now because you're expecting to hear Gamer Andy, unfortunately they're having technical difficulties, will not be able to do a live broadcast tonight.
3502457	3506319	He will be doing a podcast on his normal podcast stream.
3506940	3507820	So check that out.
3507860	3512943	However, All Games Interactive will be here live right after we wrap up in just a few minutes here.
3513043	3515004	And there might be OLR people on that too.
3515704	3517125	I've got to pee so bad.
3517145	3517505	Okay.
3517785	3518846	You know what's excellent about this?
3519646	3521647	IGN has a thing about Super Smash Bros.
3522047	3522627	Brawl in there.
3523028	3537154	And it says actually that the decision to include Solid Snake is basically from when Kojima actually begged to have the Metal Gear character in the last Smash Bros.
3537174	3537495	game.
3537735	3542097	They said when asked about the possibility of Sonic the Hedgehog appearing in the game as well...
3542657	3551623	I was always hoping that they'd have a fighting game including all the characters from different games
3563120	3574249	Well, the closest we had gotten before the Smash Brothers, well, there was Sonic the Fighters, which actually, you know, I didn't see that Sonic collection that they had last year, where they were supposed to have all the old Saturn Sonic games.
3575250	3580694	And all I've got to say is, if they make a new Kid Icarus game, that's going to look sweet.
3581495	3582556	Oh, yeah.
3582656	3584678	Wow, that looks great, Kid Icarus.
3584918	3585398	Wow.
3586059	3586079	I...
3590842	3592042	We transition.
3592082	3594423	Are we about ready to wrap up?
3594463	3595283	Your producer left.
3595643	3596064	It's all right.
3596544	3597384	I'll go run and find him.
3597404	3598244	Okay, thank you very much.
3598844	3602525	We can just stay here for a little bit longer and be the fabulous internet celebrities we are.
3602545	3605266	I didn't get to talk about the Nintendo party.
3605506	3608707	I just got a call on the bat phone, so I got to make this quick.
3608747	3611208	Okay, let's hear about the Nintendo party real quick, Logeeks.
3611348	3615973	Okay, so anyways, I went to the Nintendo Party, they had Black Eyed Peas playing, it was kind of interesting.
3616153	3619616	The only thing though is I missed the preview, so I didn't get to play games beforehand.
3620177	3628665	But what's even more interesting, on the way there, I saw a runaway bus smash through two cars and into a telephone pole, and then into a Rite Aid.
3629345	3630707	So that was pretty awesome.
3631087	3633549	Well, or, I don't know, brutal.
3635823	3641705	The party wasn't really my thing, because a lot of people I didn't know there, but all the big names, I guess, were there, even from Nintendo.
3641745	3645406	Of course, no one had a name badge or anything, so we didn't know who the hell was who.
3645846	3646206	All right.
3646946	3653068	Well, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, live at the E3 Outpost.
3653088	3655748	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought, DarkSakura.
3656108	3661710	I'd like to point out the funny deal that Captain N wasn't really a Nintendo character, and the show sucked.
3662190	3663851	So reject false icons.
3664131	3665412	Final thought, Loki.
3666333	3675219	Stay tuned on E3PSB.com or E3OnPSB.com and definitely going to have a lot more stuff on there.
3675279	3677420	I'm just kind of backlogged and getting everything on there.
3677480	3680703	Lots more videos and a lot more everything.
3680803	3681943	So keep watching.
3682284	3685606	Final thought, Mr. Bobby Blackwolf and plug your site already.
3685646	3691430	BobbyBlackwolfShow.com We're going to have our E3 show is Friday night, 8 p.m.,

3705640	3706101	Good times.
3706241	3709123	Debating with Scott Rubin was a good time.
3709363	3712425	And you guys can do it again tonight after you pee.
3712546	3714247	I have got to wee in the worst way.
3714287	3715568	That's my final thought.
3715588	3715868	30 minutes.
3716088	3718250	Except for a Nutri-Grain bar that Rob gave me.
3718330	3721072	I haven't eaten since 10, so... I need to drink.
