WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:28.000
Today is Wednesday, May 10th, 2006, and we're live at E3!

00:28.000 --> 00:39.000
Good evening, everybody. We are live at the E3 Outpost in West Los Angeles.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
So, the sound sounds a little bit different tonight. That's because we're recording live here at the Arena Interactive Lounge.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Skye. Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:50.000 --> 00:50.000
Hi.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
How you doing?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Tired.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yeah?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm excited and tired at the same time. It's a very bizarre feeling.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Say hello, as well, to Tech Master, Loki.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Hello.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm doing good.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
All right. Also joining us tonight, we have some special guests, or a special guest, I should say. Say hello to Bobby.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Hey, guys.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Hey, Bobby.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
This is a thrill for me.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
It's about time we got you on our show. It just took E3 to finally get you here.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
That's all right. All right. Also, we want to say a shout-out to Mr. Lawrence Young, who's manning the controls tonight.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
We appreciate his help in making the show work.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
All right. Let's get right into it. Let's not waste time. Let's talk about E3.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
I thought what we could do, let's go down the line, talk about three interesting things we saw at E3 today.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Jamie, give us one.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
I would have to say Zelda Twilight Princess. Getting to play that was pretty fun.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Now, did you play the Zelda Twilight Princess on the Wii, or the...

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Wii.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
The Wii.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
I played on the Wii, and I went Wii.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Did Nintendo have a huge-ass line for the Wii today?

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Not if you made it in there in the early... We got in there at the tail end of the early media hours.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Right.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
So we just sort of... Once we got in line, it was pretty cool.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
I did get to hear... I never remember his name. I know his name is Charles, the guy who's Mario's voice.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Oh, right, yeah.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Sing the Mario... The old Mario theme song from the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
That's awesome.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
The guys in front of us got him to... The guys from the Mushroom Kingdom got him to sing it.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
So I have it on tape.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Sweet. That's awesome.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
It was pretty fun.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
So tell us about, how is Zelda on the Wii different from what we saw last year with the GameCube?

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Well, first of all, I didn't get to see it on the GameCube, so I don't know.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
I do know that it is widescreen, whereas the GameCube version is not.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Hurray, I'm so glad to hear there's widescreen support, because I was really worried about that with Wii.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Well, you're going to get 480p.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Good.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
But probably nothing more than that.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
All right.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Well, you know, it's something. At least my widescreen TV isn't going to go to total waste.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
So that makes me happy.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
All right, so that's one for Jamie. Loki, what would you say is one interesting thing you saw today?

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
My favorite... You know, it was really a toss-up on Sega's booth, because there's a few things I liked.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
I did get to play my first PS3 game, which would be Full Auto 2.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
And, of course, me being such a big Full Auto whore.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
They had Full Auto 2 there? I totally missed it.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah, they had Full Auto 2 there.

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
They were debuting basically all the deathmatch modes, which I said should have been in the first one, but no.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
So, anyways, they had that, and we were basically playing a six-player deathmatch and stuff, and if you won, you get a hat.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
But, of course, I don't wear a hat, so I didn't care.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
But, overall, the controls are basically the same.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
Horrible framerate problems, just like the first one.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
I mean, we're talking dropping down a crawl.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
But, then again, it's not finished either, so...

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Do you think it's just an early build issue?

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
Well, you know, I'm not sure, because the fact the first one had really bad framerate problems, too.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
So, you never know.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
But, I'm sure it's not done.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
I just want to remind folks, if you guys are hearing ambient noise in the background, that is because we're not at your usual studio.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
We are at the Arena Interactive Lounge, where the E3 Outpost is taking place.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
If you're in the LA area, this thing's going on all week.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Come on down. We're off Santa Monica Boulevard.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
We'll be here Thursday and Friday, taping live as well.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Other folks are taping, too. Scott Rubin and Lawrence Young doing their show.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Gamer Andy's got his gig going on. Bobby Blackwolf, Friday night, of course.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
So, it's just... You know what this place is?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I mean, there's like big, widescreen TVs everywhere.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
It's like a big gamer frat house.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Seriously, what it's like. It's awesome.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
It's cool. So, again, if we sound a little different out of our elements, it's because we are.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
But, that's a good thing.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Anyway, I just wanted to give that a plug, because we are kind of using their equipment tonight.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
So, we have to give them a big thank you.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
We're also in their chat room because of it.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
We're trying to keep an eye on it. It's a little harder, because we're not in our usual setup.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
chat.allgames.com

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
And there's this wristband on my arm that says over 21, which means they have alcohol here.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
That means you get to drink.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I got asked if I was over 21.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
You always get carded.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
No, we didn't get those. We'll get those later.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Oh, yeah. You're interesting.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
Very interesting thing. I'm going to give a shout out to the Music Game fans, because I know we have a lot of Music Game fans that listen to the program and are dying to know.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
So, let me talk about the Bamani setup at Konami's booth, which is very interesting.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
They sort of have a round setup.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
2DX distorted machine is there.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Guitar Freaks V2 is there.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Why? I have no idea.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
Konami did not announce that Distorted is coming out for the home here.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
They did not announce they're porting Guitar Freaks here in the US.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
So they were just there to get butts in the booth, I guess.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
I did get a chance to play each of the three new DDR home versions.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
I did play around on Universe.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Universe looks a lot better than it does in the trailer, I'll tell you that.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Universe has a very disco funky feel to it.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
The interface is a little crazy. The song select was kind of...

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
It's like a 3D wheel.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I liked it.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Yeah, I kind of liked it. I dug it.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
And there are repeats from old mixes.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
I noticed Jairus was in the demo, and there's other stuff too.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
I'm sure DDR Freak of Bamani style have lists posted already on those games.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I actually really liked UltraMix 4.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
I kind of thought UltraMix 4 had the better song list.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
The interface is just kind of like an upside down UltraMix 2.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
And there's really... I mean, it's another UltraMix.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
But I thought it had a better song list.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
It has Listen to Your Heart, it had BitMania.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I had a lot of fun playing that.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
I tried playing doubles on Universe,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
and unfortunately they had the pad set backwards.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
So that didn't work.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Supernova is exactly what you'd expect.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
And of course they have two Supernova machines, the home version.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
But, Jamie, did you play DDR Supernova home version?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
No.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
David Bowie's in it.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Let's dance.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Oh yeah, I knew that.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
That's awesome.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
And then of course, not just David Bowie, Kelly Clarkson,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
if you're into American Idol since you've been gone.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Now that's kind of weird to me because I don't think that's in the arcade.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
So it looks like there is going to be a little bit of diversity

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
between the home mix and the arcade mix.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I've got to admit, I'm getting to the point, guys,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
where DDR, especially these demos,

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
my thrill on DDR is the extra modes and the extra things that are in it,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
and they're not in these builds right now.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I was just glad they had freaking arcade cabinets there

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
because I hate playing on those goddamn soft pads.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Did you notice that they have the soft pads?

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
It's like literally saran wrap to the floor.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
At least it's not duct tape.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
What did you think of the Universe 360 pads?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
They're just like soft pads.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
I get lost on them again because, you know, I don't know.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
I'm actually going to go play Karaoke Revolution Country Edition tomorrow.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
All right, I'm going to our chat room.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Remember we're temporarily tonight in chat.allgames.com.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
We'll be there all week long because we love allgames.com.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Let's see.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Weiland wants to know, wait, Bowie isn't what?

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
David Bowie's Let's Dance is going to be a danceable song in DDR Super Nova.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Guys, guys.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
Okay, and then also going to the chat room there, let's see.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
Sephiroth1215, one of our fans, says, I hate Kelly.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Well, you know, a lot of people do, but a lot of people like her, you know.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
Speaking of Kelly, it seems that they've dropped the Karaoke Revolution title from American Idol,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
if you notice that, on the trailer.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Oh, no, I didn't notice.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
Well, first off, the game's not even to a point where they can show it at E3,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
which is why we have Country here.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
But they dropped the title.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
All they really had for the video was just, you know, the intro that you see normally on American Idol.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
It just says, coming in the winter.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Weird.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
All right.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Bobby, do you have an interesting thing you want to share with us?

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
Well, unfortunately, I didn't get to play all that much today just because, you know, getting in late

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
and, you know, just walking around and making sure I saw everything.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
Other than, you know, the utterly disappointing Square Theater,

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
which is usually a wonderful production with, like, great production values, lights everywhere,

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
you know, everything's, like, synchronized.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
This time it was just a digital projection.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
I did get to play Guitar Man Lives for the PSP.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
And you're sitting there, you're smiling and nodding.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
I wouldn't.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
It is a straight port of the PlayStation 2, same music, same note patterns and everything.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
The only thing that has changed is now if you pause it, you can continue.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
You don't have to start over.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Actually, you also have a duet mode.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Do that? Because they didn't show that.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
You play as Kira, who was the, I guess, the girl in the game.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
You can do duet mode with her, and there's a versus mode.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Okay.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
There was a versus mode in the PS2 version, though.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
It was showing it off like it was some sort of new thing, but the duet mode I know is new.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Okay.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Interesting.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
But it's still all the same songs?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
That is a bit of a letdown.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
I was hoping for some new Guitar Man, but I guess some people will be excited to see that it's on the go.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Yeah.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Okay, whatever.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
I wanted to go back to this Square Enix trailer.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
You know, I feel horrible saying this because I thought Square had some of the nicest staff that I dealt with all day.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
They had really great staff, and they were nice.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
But the trailer presentation was a letdown because a lot of what they were showing was stuff that's already out.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
Although, it is something else to see it on the digital projection and all its high-def glory.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
That was kind of neat.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Final Fantasy XIII looks sexy as hell.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
Only three seconds of gameplay to see, though, but it did look sexy.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
There was some in-game footage, but it was like the cinematic footage using the game engine.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I could tell because there were still jaggies, and it's the PlayStation 3.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Yeah.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Didn't they learn?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
We'll see, we'll see.

10:22.000 --> 10:29.000
I mean, again, these trailers, it's the same reason why I'm not screaming and hollering about Halo 3 yet.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
It's a trailer that didn't show us much of the actual game itself, you know what I mean?

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
Let's wait until I can actually get my hand on the controller, play it, try it out.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
You know what, the square thing will give the fans what they want, so whatever.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
They'll have a good time with that.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Jamie, number two, a second interesting thing you saw today.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Guitar Hero 2.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Ah, how was that?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
It was fun.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
Basically, it brought in the two that actually, it really added in something else that I wouldn't have mind seeing.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
I wanted bass mode in the first one, and this gives me bass mode.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
Instead of having versus play, you have cooperative play, which is how I think it should be anyway if, you know, you've got a band on stage.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
You know, if one person sucks, the whole band's got to pretty much blow it.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
But the way it works now is that Player 1 is lead guitar, Player 2, depending on song, is either bass or rhythm.

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
And they're even bringing in the very newest models for their available guitars, the newest Gibson guitars available.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
I'm still going to have the Flying V, they brought in the Thunderbirds, Thunderbird now.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
We still have the, you know, Les Paul, the SGs.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
And there's still hidden characters in it, new unlockable content.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
I played YYZ, that was like cool.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
That was really awesome.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
So, I mean, are there enough differences from the first game to make this, you know, worthwhile?

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
I didn't see enough to really make a judgment like that yet.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
But, you know, just having new songs to play is great.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
You know, if it were me, I would have been, I mean, I know it is on PlayStation 2,

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
but I would think that they'd want to jump to Xbox and have downloadable content.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
That would be a smart way to go.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
But as it is now, I think it's going to be pretty good.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
And they actually had those nice lovely red controllers that were really nice.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
All right, let's go to the chat room and see some comments there.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
Chantaz over in chat.allgames.com says, Halo 3 teaser ripped off System Shock.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
So, not a person who wasn't a big fan of the Halo 3,

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
or maybe he was a fan of the Halo 3 teaser, but just felt it ripped off another one.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
Funnydale says, it's sad, Square is turning Final Fantasy into the new Madden.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
I kind of agree with that.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
They need to get off Final Fantasy VII.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
They are killing it.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Final Fantasy VII football, I bet, will be next year's announcement.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
What do you think?

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
It looks like some folks in the chat room are getting buffered tonight.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Guys, I'm sure we're getting bombarded with people tonight, which is amazing.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Thank you guys for supporting the show.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Don't forget it will be on our podcast stream a little later.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Let's see.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Somebody had said something about Guitar Man.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
I want to say it was Xander here.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
Xander C says, I restarted at least three times accidentally on the original Guitar Man because I couldn't pause.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
So, that new feature will come in handy.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
Xander also says, Final Fantasy Versus XIII is being made by the Kingdom Hearts II team.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
That's correct.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
That is correct.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
It's a joint production.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
But here's the thing, dude.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
That's all we know about Final Fantasy Versus XIII.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
The trailer didn't tell a shit.

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
It tells you that there's a main male character who has psychic Miss Cleo gone way wrong abilities and that's about it.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Alright, anyway.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Girl with gun blades.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
In the original Final Fantasy XIII, yes.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Yeah.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
And then there's a Final Fantasy XIII mobile, but I'm not even going to go there because I'll cry.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Blah, blah, blah.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Final Fantasy.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Loki.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Something interesting.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Well, let's see here.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
I did, of course, also play the Wii.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I got to play Red Steel.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
And that was okay, actually.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
I don't know.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
I'm still kind of...

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
It's the first time I've played it.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
And I thought that the controls were way too sensitive.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
Like, it was very awkward playing it and it did not feel natural.

14:15.000 --> 14:27.000
And if I were a very judgmental mom buying this for my kids, I would probably be turned away by it if it's going to stay like this.

14:27.000 --> 14:37.000
Because it wasn't easy, but there were other games that were also being shown, like WarioWare, which was really awesome.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
I mean, just what they're doing with the controller is amazing.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
What you would expect from a WarioWare game.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
Overall, the Wii stuff, I did play Red Steel.

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
I played a WarioWare and this kind of like obstacle course tech demo thing.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
And each one very sensitive as far as the control scheme.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
Now, Loki and Dark Sakura, I didn't spend a lot of time in Nintendo's booth today.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
It was so crowded.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
I hate their layout this year.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I think the layout is ass.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
It's like a claustrophobic nightmare.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
I'm sorry Nintendo, but having that huge dome in the middle with the...

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
That you can't get into.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Horrible idea.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
But tell us about, because a lot of folks listening aren't going to E3, how is Nintendo's booth set up?

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
How did you guys get in there? What happens when you get in there?

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
Well, you're around basically the surrounding wall when you're in line and you go in.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
And it's like a spiral.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
They have these talking walls.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
They're like walls of pictures of people sitting in white rooms or whatever.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
But they actually have a camera and can talk to you and they have the voice of Mario there.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah, that's how we got to hear him sing.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
But it was funny though, because I was like, well, why do they have people mocking me in line as I'm waiting?

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
But I don't know, it was interesting, a little bit different.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I don't know what the point was, but...

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
There was one of those guys that was very knowledgeable and kept giving a lot of really good information.

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
So it was sort of like having a rep there to talk with you while you're in line to sort of hype you up to go see it.

16:01.000 --> 16:11.000
But once you got in, you circled around and went on this raised platform with sort of half of it covered in a picture on one side and the other side.

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
And then there were three in the middle, three widescreen TVs and different people were playing different games.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
There's another one on the wall, but that was sort of for when they did the drum demo.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Yeah.

16:22.000 --> 16:28.000
But when we went through there, Koji Kondo was playing the orchestra game and I got his autograph.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Sweet!

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
That made me very, very happy.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Was that orchestra three thing actually a game or just a demo?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
It's a game.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
It's demo.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
No, I thought they said it was gonna...

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
It's a tech demo.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Well, I guess we will see.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Alright.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Ah, shut up.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
If I wanted your opinion, I'd turn your mic on.

16:47.000 --> 16:58.000
Because they had a series of demo games playable and they were bringing out different ones as though they were going to be released later on as packaged items.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
At least as far as I was led to believe.

17:00.000 --> 17:07.000
Well, looking at what they were talking about yesterday during the press conference is that they have this Wii Sports thing.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
And it actually looks like a collection of a bunch of small games.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
Almost like, remember the first Nintendo system where they had it packaged with Mario and Duck Hunt.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
They would have a bunch of like small tech demo things that kind of almost orient you to this new control scheme.

17:23.000 --> 17:32.000
So they have the baseball, golf, tennis and a pilot wings type of game which is very kind of different.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
Bobby, a second interesting thing you saw today.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
Blink, blink, blink, blink.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
The sensitive controls of Sonic the Hedgehog on the PS3.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Wasn't that weird?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
It made me cry.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
I was not a fan of Sonic on PS3, I have to admit.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Do you know how many times I fell off the edge?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Yeah, I watched.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
It had so much potential to be good.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
And I can see Jamie getting motion sickness from that just because of the way it was jumping around.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I left it with a headache.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
I mean I felt nauseous and had a headache and on top of that my heart was broken.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
So thank you Sony.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Well do you think the Xbox version will be just as bad?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
That's in the Sega booth, we'll have to check.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah, we'll have to look tomorrow.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
I'm going to find out and if it isn't I'll blame Sega and I'll go cry there.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
I played the one in the Sega booth and the controls.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
The camera kind of was pissing me off and I couldn't figure out how to play.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I was playing the Silver Sonic one.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
They had two different levels once as Sonic wins.

18:35.000 --> 18:42.000
Silver Sonic being like super duper super science Sonic with psycho kinetic powers and crap.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
So I don't know.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
Now one of the things I do want to mention about the PS3 controller.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
Because we got to actually see it and play it that a lot of people don't realize.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Because you've never really seen a good look of it.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
And yes the PlayStation circle button in the middle is touchable.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
It didn't do anything in what we had.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
But the L2 and the R2 buttons are now like the triggers on the Xbox.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
They're not straight buttons.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
They are actually analog triggers.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
I thought that was kind of interesting.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I missed my number two.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
My number two thing I thought was interesting today would be Luminous Live.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
It's way back in the corner of the very crowded Microsoft booth.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
But oh my God it's just Luminous on the TV.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
That's all I wanted.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
It's great.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
I mean if this is only going to be five bucks I'm betting it will probably be 800 points not 400.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
But even then Luminous is such a great game.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
That was such a surprise to me.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
I could not believe that that came over on Xbox.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
That's going to be great.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
I'm so excited about it.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
But yeah for those of you guys that are wondering about Luminous Live.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
It's pretty much just Luminous on the Xbox.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Pretty hot.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
I liked it.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Music videos in the background.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Dave you other guys go to Microsoft's booth today?

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
It's not like you guys spend most of your day in West Hall whereas Bobby and I are mostly in South Hall today.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
I saw Viva Pinata the demo the presentation of Viva Pinata in there.

20:02.000 --> 20:09.000
And it's like let's see Animal Crossing meets Harvest Moon meets Spore meets some other stuff probably.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
It's kind of the way it looked.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I still don't know really what it is.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Remind me to look for Spore tomorrow.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
It's all in EA's stuff.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
We've totally missed EA today.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
We'll definitely have more tomorrow.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
Did they say they were going to have a new what was it Midnight Club game?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Or not Midnight Club Need for Speed game.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
I was looking for that today but I didn't see it at all.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
Was it Need for Speed Carbon I think?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
I don't know.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Alright one more interesting thing you saw today.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Dark Sakura.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I know you're typing in chat right now.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Oh you're arguing with somebody about graphics versus gameplay?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
That pisses me off so much.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Alright.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
What I just said is I don't want a pretty game that plays like crap.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Alright.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Okay.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Assistant is only as good as the games that are on it?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Yes?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Exactly.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
I said that to a Sony rep today and he just sort of blinked at me.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
It was funny.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Why does that not surprise me?

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
No he blinked and he thought about it because you know you're right.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Alright.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.640
Anyway my number one and actually my list has been about equal but I have to say Sonic

21:13.640 --> 21:15.000
Rivals on PSP.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Yeah?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
I loved it.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Oh my god.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
It was like everything that I loved about Sonic with racing shadow.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
And it was like playing a 2D Sonic but 3D.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
It was just fast and great and I just had the most fun and then they gave me a t-shirt

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
that I can't wear.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
It's like three sizes too big.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Well that's cool though.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Does Sega have a theater this year?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I didn't see I don't think so.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
I'm going to explore Sega in more detail tomorrow.

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
But I was just like it's a really good Sonic game on PSP.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
I mean there's only one level I got to play but if the whole thing is like that I'm all

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
over that.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
I mean it's just all the fast fun stuff I liked about Sonic and I didn't get to see

21:58.000 --> 22:04.000
too much more than just what they had on demo but I'm hoping that there's a multiplayer

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
player race because you have first place, second place I would assume you can do more

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
characters.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
I mean these sort of Sonic are just on a side scrolling level.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I think it's pretty cool.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Loki.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I played what was it?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Oh.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
I'm trying such a play.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Dead Rising.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
That game is Mr. Young.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Really fun.

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
You just you basically put them all you know put in the Dawn of Dead scenario with you

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
can do anything.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
I was picking up pots smashing the people.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
I you know ate a pie.

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
I was playing around with the Servbot mass and stuck one on you know zombie and smashed

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
it with a sledgehammer.

22:49.000 --> 22:55.000
I mean that game is going to be endless hours of fun for me.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
It's so gory but really fun.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
I'm definitely getting it when it comes out.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Awesome.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Bobby you got one more?

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
Well I mean it's not as interesting as like what everybody else played because like I

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
said I didn't get to play the Wii which is what I would be talking about but we actually

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
looked at the new Dot Hack game.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I was actually thinking about that.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
Yeah the Dot Hack it's what GU or something like that.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
I don't remember what it was.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
It's like Rebirth or something.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
Right and but it looks like it's going to be another episodic you know and they don't

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
know the guy that I talked to didn't know what price it was going to be or anything

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
but it looked like more of the same.

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
Now it did have a lot more like animations and stuff and I actually got like the typical

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
anime where it shows the three main characters in like a split screen view for half a second

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
then they all go crazy and everything goes red but the demo I wish it was longer because

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
I really didn't get it.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
Yeah that was my biggest problem with the Dot Hack demo is it wasn't long enough and

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
you pretty much fought the same monster although I thought getting on the bike was cool.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Yeah you can ride around on a bike.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
Dot Hack is kind of a fan service thing anyway you know.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
How are you going to be disappointed in Dot Hack this Dot Hack game if you're a Dot Hack

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
anime fan.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
But you know if you like the first it feels like just like the first games with a little

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
more like the super combos and stuff that I missed in the first series of games.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Gosh what should I do for my last interesting thing.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
I'm going to say Phantasy Star Universe.

24:19.000 --> 24:25.000
Phantasy Star Universe I got to play it on PC which looked superior to the PS2 one I

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
saw.

24:26.000 --> 24:32.000
It's it's it's great because they didn't change a lot of the Phantasy Star online formula.

24:32.000 --> 24:38.000
They just made it a little better that you can do a little more super attacks like it

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
looked like he had some more like tactical points kind of thing that you can only do

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
so many power hits in a row.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
So you can't just keep pouring those power hits but you can actually like get in a fourth

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
hit.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
I think Phantasy Star Universe is going to be if you guys are on Phantasy Star online

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
it's going to be great for you guys.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
Unfortunately the only disappointment I have with that is that there weren't they weren't

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
showing the 360 version.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
So that kind of made me a little sad.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
All right.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
So I guess we all got our interesting things out.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I got a wacky question.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Can we can we take calls.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Yes you can.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
We do calls.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Yes.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Give out the number Bobby.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
OK.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Well you can either do we have both Skype and the toll free number.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
OK.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Give out the toll free number because you don't want to have to have all those people

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
on Skype.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
OK.

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
So the toll free number is 1 8 6 6 8 8 0 0 1 5 6.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
That's a toll free number here in the United States.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Go ahead put that in chat.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
Lawrence one call at a time though because when we get like two people on the line I

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
get crazy.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
So.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
All right.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Real quick though before we while we're waiting for some calls.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Booth babes.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Big controversy.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
And there really weren't a whole lot on the show for this year.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
I saw some in the Final Fantasy and I remember I turned to you and I'm like five thousand

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
dollars.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Well they were Mithra girls though.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
There were more cosplayers than booth babes.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Yeah.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
What do you think.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Is the show different without booth babes.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
I didn't notice they weren't there.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
I didn't notice nor did I miss nor did I care.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
I did.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
You know I didn't really notice either and I hope I don't come off sounding like the

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
token gay guy in the show saying that but I just.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
I really didn't change the show because the show is about the games not about that scenery

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
and people were going in to see the games anyway.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
What was that.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Somebody had come up with a creative substitute for the booth babes anyway.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
What are you guys talking about in the bus.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
We were talking about the Transformers.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
I don't know if that was more.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Yeah.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Yeah.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
There was there was there's an Optimus Prime in one of the booths and there's no Transformers

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
game in there but it got him in the booth.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
There was a banner for the Transformers movie.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Oh is that what it was.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Yeah.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Savages.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Savages.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
A bunch of savages.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Where's my game.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
All right.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
They did a Transformers game and it wasn't very good.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
They've done several.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
PlayStation 3.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Did.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Did your.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
It sounds like we all got to play PlayStation 3 today.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Yeah.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
Did your impressions of the PlayStation 3 go up from the Sony conference.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Were you disappointed.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
What did you think.

27:01.000 --> 27:12.000
I also played Gran Turismo HD and it was like another Gran Turismo and it was pretty but

27:12.000 --> 27:20.000
honestly I I also saw that Heavenly Blade my my opinion is still remains the same Sony

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
shot themselves actually Heavenly Sword Heavenly Sword.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
All right.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
All right.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
I'm thinking Dancing Blade which is another PlayStation game.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
I still think that they've shot themselves in the foot.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
And this time with having not the best of games to show for it.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
We have a caller on the line.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
OK.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I thought then I'll say hello to the car.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
It was crap then.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Crap now.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
All right.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Hi.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
You're on Orange Lounge Radio live at the E3 Outpost.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Who's this.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
It's the Ichiban Crush.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
The Ichiban Crush one of my very favorite posters on the forums.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
What's on your mind buddy.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Yeah.

28:00.000 --> 28:09.000
So I'm looking at the E3 news on Monday and see the price announcement for PS3.

28:09.000 --> 28:16.000
I can't help to wonder myself man but I mean I know this is Blu-ray and you're not going

28:16.000 --> 28:22.000
to hear you just cannot get any cheaper than that but this thing really going to sell you.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
Here's my thing with PlayStation 3 Sony has really yet to explain why their console is

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
worth 200 more bucks than Xbox 360.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
And in playing the demos today I mean for instance Sonic Sonic is a game that's on Xbox

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
360.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
Why do I need to invest the extra money in the PlayStation 3.

28:40.000 --> 28:46.000
However to PlayStation 3's credits they do have a grip on some of the real great franchises

28:46.000 --> 28:52.000
that Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer is you know fanboy boner inducing Final Fantasy 13.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
I mean you know I'm a big Final Fantasy fan so of course.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Oh yeah.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Oh God.

28:57.000 --> 29:04.000
And you know they've got games that I think are going to cater to the fanboys you know

29:04.000 --> 29:10.000
but they're still for the average gamer Microsoft's in a great position right now because their

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
system is cheaper and it's at a glance right now seems to do the same thing as PlayStation

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
3.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
What was missing from that conference for me was that Sony didn't tell me why I needed

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Blu-ray.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Does anybody else have thoughts on that.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
Well I don't know I've actually played Final Fantasy 12 and if that's any indication what

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
Final Fantasy 13 is going to be then I'm better off without it.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
I like I love Final Fantasy 12 a whole lot.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Final Fantasy 12 had the single worst combat system ever.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
It took the stuff that was good about grandia and made it crap.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
We agree to disagree there I suppose.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
Like what was with that whole line business.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
Zander C and Chad don't like Microsoft.

29:50.000 --> 29:55.000
Zander C says Microsoft has yet to show why their console is worth more than 150 dollars.

29:55.000 --> 30:02.000
I the stuff they're doing with arcade and Gears of War this is incredible.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
I'm I guys I know how you feel.

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
If you had told me four years ago I would be here saying positive things about Microsoft.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I would have said you're full of shit.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
You know we lost planet right now.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
This is lost planet that looks really good.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
This is one reason why this console is over you know worth the money that it is I mean

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
lost planet right here.

30:22.000 --> 30:30.000
One Capcom really has you know a level mind when it comes to the games that they're putting out in the 360.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
They are truly next gen.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
I mean Dead Rising and Lost Planet just two of the finest games on the 360.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
They're coming out this year.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
All right.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
It's Yvonne crush anything else on your mind any other questions for us.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
I'll be honest with you.

30:48.000 --> 30:56.000
I'm really really worried about this upcoming this whole upcoming next gen just mainly because of Sony.

30:56.000 --> 31:03.000
I don't think it's going to cause another crash like everyone's been saying for the past two decades.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
But I don't know I'm just not feeling it this time around.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
Not the way I was with the 16 bit 32 bit era.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
You know it's it's a different battle this time because the battle is not just about the games.

31:17.000 --> 31:23.000
But it's about getting that console in your living room so you can get the music and the on demand movies and all this other stuff.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
That's a factor that we've never had to really deal with before.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
So I think that's kind of what makes a lot of this very interesting.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
So but yeah you're right.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
It's this one is too hard to tell because look at Japan.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
You know Xbox has really yet to catch on there is.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Is it going to catch wildfire after E3.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
I don't know it's hard for me to say.

31:44.000 --> 31:51.000
You know it could be very I think what would be most interesting about this is if Microsoft ends up on top here in the US.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
Again I'm purely speculating guys please don't take this as my opinion on what's going to happen or whatever.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
But what if Microsoft's on top here in the US and then Sony's on top in Japan.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Wouldn't that be something.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
That means that we're still going to get another crappy PlayStation later on.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
I hope I hope Sony's taking the feedback.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
You know it seems like they did it before when everybody bitched about the boomerang controller.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
They went back and changed it.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
So hopefully Sony's listen this time.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Who knows.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
The boomerang just looks uncomfortable.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
All right.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
It's about the controller like the boomerang.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It's not good.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
It's my crush.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
You know I love you but I got to let you go so we can get more.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
All right.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Absolutely.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Thanks guys.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Thanks for calling.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
I'm going.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
All right.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
You too.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
One of the things I did before he called was about you were talking about Gran Turismo.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
And a lot of people probably looked at the demo and they're like oh that's so cool the people move.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
Well I'm going to tell you right now they are still 2D paper people.

32:47.000 --> 32:55.000
I looked and you know the people because that's one of the things a lot of people have about the Gran Turismo series is that the people look like they're like 2D pieces of paper.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
And they still are in that early demo.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Listen.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
I played the Tokyo track and it.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
I'm going to.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
We're going to go to another call guys.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
This is Nintendo Orange Launch Radio live at E3 Outpost.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Who's this?

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Hello.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
This is Nintendo Maniac 64 or Bad Starter Maniac 64.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Hi Nintendo Maniac 64.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
How are you doing?

33:15.000 --> 33:21.000
I'm static over the whole freeze thing because I'm all the way in the east coast.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
You're static about the freeze going on right now.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Yeah.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
What's going on?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Is the weather nuts or something?

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
It's been kind of hot.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
It's been kind of hot recently.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Well tell us about E3.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
What are your thoughts on E3 so far?

33:40.000 --> 33:46.000
Well one thing that caught my attention actually was Nintendo's press conference when they were doing the DS game.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
They showed Diddy Kong Racing.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
They had them show Snowball Valley from the original on there.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
It was interesting.

33:53.000 --> 34:02.000
You've got a good eye because honestly I was one of those people that didn't really care about Diddy Kong Racing because I was too distracted by the thoughts of Star Fox on the DS.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
Because they kind of showed that all at once and I was like ooh Star Fox.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Ah fuck Diddy Kong I want Star Fox.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Diddy Kong Racing sucked anyways.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
Well this is Nintendo Maniac so he might have a different opinion.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Alright.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
You got any questions for us Nintendo Maniac?

34:17.000 --> 34:23.000
Um, let's see...

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
Oh yeah.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Oh you know what never mind on that question.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Alright.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Let's see is there anything else?

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
Oh how long did you have to wait to get to play Twilight Princess?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
To get to play what?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
To get to play Twilight Princess.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
I can't.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Twilight Princess.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Oh Twilight Princess.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
I waited about 30 to 45 minutes.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
There were people in front of us who were hogging it and passing it off to their friends and everything.

34:50.000 --> 34:57.000
And so we actually waited for a while and then we just ended up talking about all kinds of other things and then by the time we were up there.

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
Keep in mind though she was in the early access media hours which was a benefit.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
Now I'm talking about once I was already in.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Oh damn.

35:06.000 --> 35:11.000
Yeah see it takes about an hour to two and a half hours from what they told me to get into the Wii area.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
And then you got to wait behind people. It's just normal kiosk once you get in there.

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
Alright Nintendo Maniac 64 thanks so much for the call. We're going to go ahead and let you go buddy okay?

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Okay.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Alright have a good one.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Bye.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
Alright we're going to take one more call. Let's see who we got.

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
Lawrence Young the man on the controls. Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Hey this is SSJ100Mav.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
SSJ100Mav what's on your mind buddy? Thanks for the call. What's going on?

35:37.000 --> 35:44.000
Hey I was wondering what you guys thought of the new test members on Super Smash Brothers.

35:44.000 --> 35:50.000
Super Smash Brothers. Loki you pulled up the story. Fill us in on what's going on with Super Smash Brothers.

35:50.000 --> 35:56.000
Well they announced today that there's going to be a title called Super Smash Brothers Brawl coming out for the Wii.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.000
Looks like it's going to be controlled kind of the same way as the original Super Smash Brothers.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
Probably not with the Wii controller but then again we don't know we're just speculating.

36:05.000 --> 36:14.000
However some of the characters in it are quite interesting. For example you've got Snake from Metal Gear Solid.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
That is crazy.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Pit from Kid Icarus.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Yay!

36:19.000 --> 36:27.000
Nintendo thank you for finally fucking acknowledging this game you've ignored for the past like 20 years.

36:27.000 --> 36:32.000
You have Wario is going to be another one and also Zero Suit Samus.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Ooh that's pretty hot.

36:34.000 --> 36:43.000
Which was pretty interesting and then there was one more I want to say oh god I don't remember some metal robot thing.

36:43.000 --> 36:52.000
But one of the very interesting things that's on here they show one of the attacks and what's one of the attacks but an Nintendog licking the screen.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Oh Jesus.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
He's so bumpy.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
You guys.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
And Snake has his box.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Alright.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
That's great.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
This is J100 Matt we got to wrap up and thanks so much for the call alright. Have a good one buddy.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
It is good.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Alright.

37:06.000 --> 37:13.000
So that's going to be our last call for the night we're going to wrap up so that we can get out of here so all games interactive can take over for a little bit so.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Oh stretch.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
No I'm getting the stretch it out sign.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Ok never mind then we won't.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Comments from chat room.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Boss Tone, Totion they all want to know.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Dance Dance TV.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
What the hell do we think of this?

37:26.000 --> 37:35.000
If you guys didn't hear what is it Loki correct me if I'm wrong because I was reading about this late last night CBS television is option Dance Dance TV right.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Yeah.

37:36.000 --> 37:42.000
And Dance Dance TV is going to be a show that's going to be what the Saturday morning slumber party on CBS or something like that.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
I don't know and I'm kind of afraid to even consider wanting to know.

37:47.000 --> 37:57.000
What I picked up on it is that it's like it's supposed to be teams of kids competing against each other and it's inspired by DDR or something like that.

37:57.000 --> 38:06.000
So you know what guys from Konami's perspective it's all about whatever is going to sell more games right.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I don't see this as a bad thing.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Am I going to watch it.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Fuck no.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
But am I going to hate it just because it's out there.

38:14.000 --> 38:38.000
No I understand we got to do crazy things to promote our stuff sometimes I don't I don't think it's a bad thing and I don't think it's going to make DDR look stupid because I honestly if somebody were to come up to me and tell me dude you're playing that DDR game that's on a little girls morning TV show I would say dude you were watching Saturday morning TV for little girls.

38:38.000 --> 38:44.000
I don't know. It looks stupid. I'm not watching it but I don't know.

38:44.000 --> 38:49.000
Zander C in chat room says they're a little late to be making a DVR TV show.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
They should have tried that back in 2002.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Remember DVR the movie.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Oh that was such a fan thing.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
I know.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
All right.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
I'm going to kind of try to wind it down here a little bit.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
I want to go around and talk about what are you guys looking forward to tomorrow.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
It's a three day show.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
What do you want to do tomorrow.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Dark Sakura.

39:07.000 --> 39:14.000
Tomorrow I'm actually planning on hanging out with SEGA and Namco Bandai a bit more.

39:14.000 --> 39:20.000
But SEGA really because they have a game I want to actually see if it plays just right.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
They had I went by and someone was playing Mighty Final Fight on a PSP.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
And you know I love Final Fight.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
I think that's like Capcom collection.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Yeah.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
I played Power Stone collection.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
It's just not that I missed the Dreamcast.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
It's not the same on the small screen I'm sorry.

39:36.000 --> 39:43.000
Well this I was a little surprised that the games that are on it they have the NES versions

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
of the games like they have the Nintendo version of Strider which was I don't like it because

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
it's that whole story thing based off of the old Strider manga that was out a few years

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
ago.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
I would much rather have them do like you know a Mega Drive collection where we have

39:58.000 --> 40:04.000
Strider you know like the actual arcade Strider and you know actual arcade Final Fight in

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
this you know because the PSP could easily do it but these are Nintendo.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
This is going to be random but I forgot to tell you Strider's on Game Cab now.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
I knew that.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Pretty hot huh.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
You told me yesterday.

40:15.000 --> 40:21.000
Now Jamie did you see that they had that Capcom classic collection mini that's going to be

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
on the Game Boy Advance which has Strider and Bionic Commando.

40:26.000 --> 40:31.000
Well that's the other game that was on the PSP thing was Bionic Commando.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Excellent.

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
Honestly I love Mighty Final Fight but I have that on Nintendo.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I have all those on Nintendo.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I can just play them on Nintendo.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
So that just seems like sort of a waste of the PSP right there even though I love all

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
those games.

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
So I do plan on giving it a play, see how it plays, see if it's anything like it, if

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
it'd be worth it to me if it adds anything or anything worthwhile but I'm definitely

40:55.000 --> 41:02.000
going to be hanging out around Capcom and Sega and Namco Bandai tomorrow.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Alright.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Going to chat room for some comments here.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
Rockus, O-L-R Rockus wants to know in chat.allgames.com.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
Song list updates for the DDR's anyone?

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Honestly I'm going to be honest with you.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Check DDRfreak.com or BomaniStyle.com.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I'm sure they have it up.

41:16.000 --> 41:21.000
I know I played Precious, some remix of Precious by Depeche Mode in the universe one and I

41:21.000 --> 41:29.000
played Listen to Your Heart in UltraMix 4 and I played Since You've Been Gone on Supernova.

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
I did get to play Seduction in the vocal mix now which is in Supernova in the arcade.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Sweet.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Actually I did want to issue a challenge.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Okay.

41:38.000 --> 41:44.000
If any of our listeners are at E3 I would love to meet people up at SNK to own them

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
on King of Fighters 2006.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Awesome.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
Quick programming note just for people here on the live stream, sorry to your podcast

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
folks over here.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
That's alright.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
All Games Interactive will be going on after Gamer Andy.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
We're not, so we're going, O-L-R is going to go until about 8.15.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Oh are we really?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Okay.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
So I'm letting them know at the same time instead of trying to whisper in their ear.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
Okay.

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
So yeah, but Gamer Andy live from the Microsoft press conference at 8.15 and then All Games

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
Interactive at 9.30 when they get kicked out of the Microsoft press conference.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
Alright.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
So you're, don't worry about ending right now.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Alright.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
You've got a little while longer.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
But if you want to take more calls, that's cool.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Alright, maybe we'll do more calls in a little bit.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
For right now though, let's finish up this thought we were going down.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Something you want to look at tomorrow.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Loki, what are you going to be doing tomorrow?

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
I will probably be hitting up the Sony booth because I was mainly in, was it South Hall

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
today.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
So I need to hit up West Hall.

42:35.000 --> 42:40.000
There's still parts of South Hall that I haven't seen so I might need to go back there.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
I actually hit up a lot of the Korean booths today.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
I think just because I was that bored.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
And then, I don't know.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
Probably, yeah, just hitting up some of the games I haven't played for Sony.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Just trying all the new ones.

42:54.000 --> 43:00.000
Maybe trying Nintendo again to see if I can try playing, you know, Metroid Prime 3 or

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
something like that.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Other than that, I don't know.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
Oh, I got to check out the PSP stuff definitely.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
Yeah.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
I didn't do that either.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
Let's go to the, we got the call sign.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
So let's go to the phones.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
Who's this?

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
This is SilentWind96.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Hello, SilentWind96.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
What's on your mind?

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Oh, just chilling here.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
I'm down the street in my hotel and I was...

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
Come on down.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
Yeah.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
I didn't, I couldn't get a pass.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
So I couldn't, I couldn't get a temporary job at EB Games or nothing so I could get

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
into this joint.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
But...

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Wait, wait.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
You couldn't get into E3 at all?

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
No, I don't have any credentials to get in.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
So I couldn't get into E3 at all.

43:30.000 --> 43:45.000
No, I don't have any credentials to get in so I couldn't really...

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
No, come to the outpost.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
You know what?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
At the outpost, you don't need a credential.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
You can get in here.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Oh, really?

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Yeah.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
I'll tell you what.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
You know what?

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
I'll get you in.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
We will get you in this place for free.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Right?

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Can we do that?

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
Yeah.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
You know what?

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
I can't...

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Does he have a...

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
Can you send somebody...

44:03.000 --> 44:04.320
How do we get him in touch with us?

44:04.320 --> 44:06.920
Actually, you're in chat so you just PM me your name.

44:06.920 --> 44:07.920
Okay.

44:07.920 --> 44:10.320
I want you to send a private message to Black Wolf and he'll get you in touch.

44:10.320 --> 44:11.320
Okay.

44:11.320 --> 44:12.320
Get on down here.

44:12.320 --> 44:13.320
You can get in this place at least.

44:13.320 --> 44:14.320
Oh, yeah.

44:14.320 --> 44:15.320
Thank you.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.320
All right.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.320
Any questions you want to know about E3?

44:17.320 --> 44:18.320
I'm so sorry to hear you didn't get in.

44:18.320 --> 44:21.320
Any thing you want to mention about the show or?

44:21.320 --> 44:23.320
Well, first of all I just...

44:23.320 --> 44:24.960
I love the show, guys.

44:24.960 --> 44:31.320
I mean, I have a crappy internet connection here at the hotel but I can at least hear

44:31.320 --> 44:32.320
the stream.

44:32.320 --> 44:33.320
Thank you so much.

44:33.320 --> 44:35.320
But other than that, I picked up a...

44:35.320 --> 44:43.640
I got a DS Live I imported recently and I'm loving it.

44:43.640 --> 44:45.080
How is that?

44:45.080 --> 44:46.080
Is it...

44:46.080 --> 44:47.080
That's great.

44:47.080 --> 44:50.080
What makes it so much better than the original DS?

44:50.080 --> 44:56.800
Well, I never touched the original DS so I liked this and it looked really cool.

44:56.800 --> 45:04.320
I found it on eBay and I blew away Scott and Lawrence and I told him I got it for $99 off

45:04.320 --> 45:05.320
of eBay.

45:05.320 --> 45:06.320
Wow.

45:06.320 --> 45:11.440
They actually had this for their demo unit for...

45:11.440 --> 45:14.440
It was some really awful card game but it was...

45:14.440 --> 45:17.960
I have to say that I enjoyed the brighter screen on it.

45:17.960 --> 45:20.200
It felt a little bit easier.

45:20.200 --> 45:22.080
Yeah, it was alright.

45:22.080 --> 45:23.080
Alright.

45:23.080 --> 45:26.600
Well, SilentWind96, we'll see you in a little bit and you're getting the hookup, man, because

45:26.600 --> 45:28.760
this is an invite-only party tonight here.

45:28.760 --> 45:29.760
In television.

45:29.760 --> 45:30.760
Yeah.

45:30.760 --> 45:31.760
The Mario Rock Opera is...

45:31.760 --> 45:33.080
Mario Rock Opera is setting up.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.400
They got a whole DJ thing down there.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.400
I mean, there's stuff all over.

45:36.400 --> 45:37.400
Yeah, Supernova Sound.

45:37.400 --> 45:41.720
In television, everywhere, but there's new stuff, too, but who doesn't love these classics?

45:41.720 --> 45:42.720
Okay.

45:42.720 --> 45:43.720
It's great.

45:43.720 --> 45:44.720
Get your butt down here right now.

45:44.720 --> 45:45.720
Wait.

45:45.720 --> 45:46.720
Where did I meet you?

45:46.720 --> 45:47.720
Alright.

45:47.720 --> 45:48.720
We'll see you in the details.

45:48.720 --> 45:49.720
PM me in chat.

45:49.720 --> 45:50.720
Alright.

45:50.720 --> 45:51.720
Cool.

45:51.720 --> 45:52.720
Have a good one, buddy.

45:52.720 --> 45:53.720
Alright.

45:53.720 --> 45:54.720
Talk to you later.

45:54.720 --> 45:55.720
Thank you.

45:55.720 --> 45:56.720
Alright.

45:56.720 --> 45:57.720
Let's see.

45:57.720 --> 45:58.720
Can we give out the number one more time?

45:58.720 --> 46:01.720
I guess we'll do a couple more calls if there's anyone wants to call in.

46:01.720 --> 46:02.840
1-866-8800156.

46:02.840 --> 46:05.120
That is a toll-free number in the United States.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.120
Okay.

46:06.120 --> 46:10.080
And don't call in asking to get in free tonight because we just gave our one away, so that's

46:10.080 --> 46:11.080
it.

46:11.080 --> 46:12.080
We're done.

46:12.080 --> 46:13.080
But here's the good news.

46:13.080 --> 46:18.400
You can come Thursday or Friday and you can get in and, you know, it's a good time.

46:18.400 --> 46:21.400
So if you still want to come down, Thursday and Friday we'll be here as well because we're

46:21.400 --> 46:22.400
taping both nights.

46:22.400 --> 46:23.400
Okay.

46:23.400 --> 46:24.400
Where did we leave off?

46:24.400 --> 46:25.400
Bobby.

46:25.400 --> 46:27.320
Oh, Bobby's on the phone, so I'll go.

46:27.320 --> 46:29.240
One thing I want to see tomorrow.

46:29.240 --> 46:33.440
I didn't freaking touch the Wii, so I guess I'm going to have to wait in that.

46:33.440 --> 46:34.440
You want to touch the Wii?

46:34.440 --> 46:36.900
I want to touch Nintendo's Wii.

46:36.900 --> 46:37.900
So bad.

46:37.900 --> 46:43.880
So I'm going to wait in that horrible line and just get it over with so I can say I played

46:43.880 --> 46:46.200
the damn Wii so I can come here and tell you all about it.

46:46.200 --> 46:48.360
So that's essentially my day.

46:48.360 --> 46:53.640
Otherwise, I didn't see anything in West Hall besides Sony and I know Tecmo's over there

46:53.640 --> 46:56.400
and I know there's other booths over there I want to check out.

46:56.400 --> 47:05.560
I would suggest going by Atlas for Disgaea 2 and Koei, of course, for Guitar Man Lives.

47:05.560 --> 47:11.200
I want to play their Fatal in their show also.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.200
Let's see.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.320
I'm going to go over to chat here and see what's going on here.

47:14.320 --> 47:18.300
Tiger Claw wants to know, are we going to be able to hear the Mario Rock Opera tonight

47:18.300 --> 47:19.460
as well?

47:19.460 --> 47:23.280
I think unfortunately they don't because Gamer Andy's going to be live somewhere else right

47:23.280 --> 47:24.520
at that moment, right?

47:24.520 --> 47:26.080
That was what that phone call was.

47:26.080 --> 47:27.320
Oh, really?

47:27.320 --> 47:28.320
They're not going to be live.

47:28.320 --> 47:30.840
They cannot get it to work on Microsoft servers.

47:30.840 --> 47:31.840
They're going to still record.

47:31.840 --> 47:34.640
I apologize to all of Gamer Andy's fans in chat.

47:34.640 --> 47:35.720
There are some in there.

47:35.720 --> 47:40.120
All Games Interactive will be going on and they'll still have the show up on their podcast

47:40.120 --> 47:41.120
feed.

47:41.120 --> 47:42.120
Well, okay.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.120
So the Gamer Andy fans still have that.

47:43.120 --> 47:44.120
Right.

47:44.120 --> 47:47.240
And Gamer Andy will be here tomorrow night.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.520
Nice guy, Gamer Andy, and a lot of friends.

47:49.520 --> 47:50.520
He's got quite a click.

47:50.520 --> 47:51.520
They've got eight people.

47:51.520 --> 47:53.200
He's got a huge entourage.

47:53.200 --> 47:55.200
Gamerandy.com.

47:55.200 --> 47:56.200
And they've got the hookup.

47:56.200 --> 47:57.760
They played Gears of War.

47:57.760 --> 48:01.680
I was talking to Andy because they got behind closed doors at Microsoft and they played

48:01.680 --> 48:02.680
Gears of War.

48:02.680 --> 48:03.680
They said it's awesome.

48:03.680 --> 48:04.680
They're getting it.

48:04.680 --> 48:05.680
Yeah.

48:05.680 --> 48:06.880
Major Nelson was on their show tonight, right?

48:06.880 --> 48:07.880
I believe so.

48:07.880 --> 48:08.880
Yeah.

48:08.880 --> 48:11.680
And we were trying to rig it to get it to work and they just can't get it to work on

48:11.680 --> 48:12.680
their Wi-Fi over there.

48:12.680 --> 48:13.680
Frickin' technology.

48:13.680 --> 48:14.680
Yeah.

48:14.680 --> 48:15.680
All right.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.880
Bobby, what are you looking forward to doing tomorrow at the show?

48:17.880 --> 48:18.880
Wii.

48:18.880 --> 48:19.880
Wii.

48:19.880 --> 48:22.360
You're going to go Wii, Wii, Wii all the way home?

48:22.360 --> 48:23.680
No, just in the morning.

48:23.680 --> 48:25.720
Just going to go over there and wait, whatever, the two hours or whatever.

48:25.720 --> 48:27.720
You're going to go over and Wii in West Hall in the morning?

48:27.720 --> 48:28.720
Yeah.

48:28.720 --> 48:29.720
All right.

48:29.720 --> 48:30.720
Yeah, I'm going directly there.

48:30.720 --> 48:31.720
Right in the center of Nintendo's booth I'm going to Wii.

48:31.720 --> 48:32.720
Yeah.

48:32.720 --> 48:35.600
I'm going to go with my Wii and then because I really want to play the conducting game

48:35.600 --> 48:40.480
and that drum demo, you know, the virtual drum because I mean I'm a musician and I want

48:40.480 --> 48:45.360
to see if I'm any better at Miyamoto than he was at his conference.

48:45.360 --> 48:48.040
But other than that, you know, checking out more of Microsoft's booth, I really want to

48:48.040 --> 48:49.920
see Luminous Live just like you.

48:49.920 --> 48:50.920
Yeah.

48:50.920 --> 48:55.240
So that, you know, and I still got to go do Kensha Hall stuff for my show sometime.

48:55.240 --> 48:56.240
All right.

48:56.240 --> 48:58.000
Dark Soccer wants to address chat.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.560
Xander, she was asking about Fire Emblem.

49:00.560 --> 49:06.000
There were ads for Fire Emblem and it was there at Nintendo's press conference, but

49:06.000 --> 49:08.200
I didn't see anything playable for it.

49:08.200 --> 49:13.680
Then again, I didn't look too deep into the DS area, honestly.

49:13.680 --> 49:17.200
So I will go hunt out anything on Fire Emblem tomorrow I can.

49:17.200 --> 49:19.120
I know lots of people are interested in that series.

49:19.120 --> 49:20.120
I love the series.

49:20.120 --> 49:22.320
I can't play it for crap, but I love the series.

49:22.320 --> 49:26.080
So I will look up Fire Emblem stuff for y'all tomorrow.

49:26.080 --> 49:28.440
All right.

49:28.440 --> 49:33.040
What's done in chat right now is questioning is Super Smash Brothers, this new one, a real

49:33.040 --> 49:34.040
game?

49:34.040 --> 49:35.960
Or was it just a whole fan service thing?

49:35.960 --> 49:40.040
No, they have pictures from the conference with the people, with Miyamoto in the end.

49:40.040 --> 49:41.760
Yeah, I would think it's real.

49:41.760 --> 49:42.760
Oh, okay.

49:42.760 --> 49:43.760
Yeah.

49:43.760 --> 49:45.240
They say it in chat.

49:45.240 --> 49:46.240
I say it out loud.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.240
You know, that's what we do.

49:47.240 --> 49:52.160
I even have this cool montage where Snake is talking to Ocelot or whatever, you know,

49:52.160 --> 49:53.160
whatever his name.

49:53.160 --> 49:54.160
Otacon.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.160
Otacon.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.160
All right.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.960
Listen, I don't play Metal Gear Solid, so that's why I'm going to butcher everything.

49:57.960 --> 50:02.640
All I know is it's a game about a guy named, you know, Solid Snake, and that's as far as

50:02.640 --> 50:03.640
I go.

50:03.640 --> 50:08.800
Folks in chat want to know about Excite Truck.

50:08.800 --> 50:09.800
You guys saw it.

50:09.800 --> 50:10.800
I didn't.

50:10.800 --> 50:11.800
What do you think about Excite Truck?

50:11.800 --> 50:12.860
I want that game.

50:12.860 --> 50:16.800
It looks like burn or it looks like it scores like burnout.

50:16.800 --> 50:17.880
It's very interesting.

50:17.880 --> 50:23.480
The truck is extremely fast, so it's kind of like Excite Bike a little bit.

50:23.480 --> 50:24.480
Just very interesting.

50:24.480 --> 50:25.480
I don't know.

50:25.480 --> 50:29.920
No one seemed to be able to keep their truck on the road, but it looked fun.

50:29.920 --> 50:31.600
I like the way they do their scoring system.

50:31.600 --> 50:36.240
It's kind of like burnout where you get points for, you know, driving dangerously, catching

50:36.240 --> 50:40.320
a lot of air, going fast, being in first place, and that stuff, and they'll give you a ranking

50:40.320 --> 50:46.880
on the race, everything from, like, D to triple A, S. I don't know.

50:46.880 --> 50:50.000
They did say, though, that it wasn't, you weren't going to be able to do anything online

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
with it.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
It's kind of dumb.

50:53.000 --> 50:57.880
I'm hoping that they have the whole, you know, build a level, save it, take it to your friend's

50:57.880 --> 50:58.880
house.

50:58.880 --> 51:00.760
Nintendo needs to do online, dammit.

51:00.760 --> 51:03.840
Get with the program.

51:03.840 --> 51:08.040
They did have Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam there, and I didn't get to play that or Tony Hawk's

51:08.040 --> 51:13.480
Project 8, which I have no idea what the hell Project 8 is, but I don't know.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.080
It should be good.

51:15.080 --> 51:23.520
Project Cammer was another game that they had at the Wii booths, and I didn't know,

51:23.520 --> 51:26.520
I'm not very interested in that game, to be honest.

51:26.520 --> 51:28.520
They had a Sonic game, though.

51:28.520 --> 51:31.800
Sonic, what was it, Wildfire?

51:31.800 --> 51:33.800
How was that?

51:33.800 --> 51:34.800
I didn't play it.

51:34.800 --> 51:35.800
Looked good, though.

51:35.800 --> 51:36.800
They had Bomberman.

51:36.800 --> 51:37.800
They had Bomberman, was there.

51:37.800 --> 51:38.800
And the Virtual Console.

51:38.800 --> 51:39.800
Super Monkey Ball.

51:39.800 --> 51:40.800
They had the Virtual Console.

51:40.800 --> 51:41.800
Virtual Console.

51:41.800 --> 51:46.800
They were playing them.

51:46.800 --> 51:47.800
I want to see it all.

51:47.800 --> 51:48.800
Tell me about it.

51:48.800 --> 51:49.800
Mario World.

51:49.800 --> 51:50.800
Tell me, tell me, tell me about it.

51:50.800 --> 51:51.800
How did it work?

51:51.800 --> 51:52.800
How does it look?

51:52.800 --> 51:57.200
I actually, I didn't get to check it out because I was feeling a little ill.

51:57.200 --> 52:02.040
We will have some, hopefully some pictures online soon of the Virtual Console, but in

52:02.040 --> 52:08.520
the meantime, if you are really, you know, trying to get a look at it, I believe Joystiq

52:08.520 --> 52:14.840
had pictures of it online and I'm trying to find the link so we can put it in chat, but

52:14.840 --> 52:15.840
it looked pretty cool.

52:15.840 --> 52:22.440
They had, on demo, they actually had the Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo.

52:22.440 --> 52:30.880
I think Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64, Bonk for the TurboGrafx, Sonic for the Genesis,

52:30.880 --> 52:33.080
of course, and Super Nintendo.

52:33.080 --> 52:35.200
They had Super Mario World.

52:35.200 --> 52:36.200
Super Mario World.

52:36.200 --> 52:39.600
So, definitely really cool looking.

52:39.600 --> 52:49.840
Yeah, it looks very solid, very sexy, very white, but here, now obviously this is not

52:49.840 --> 52:55.400
really great radio, but Rob, here's pictures of the Virtual Console on my laptop here.

52:55.400 --> 52:56.920
Oh, that's pretty hot.

52:56.920 --> 52:57.920
I like that.

52:57.920 --> 52:58.920
Yeah, I do like that.

52:58.920 --> 52:59.920
It's bigger than I thought.

52:59.920 --> 53:02.360
It's on a gadget, guys, if you want to go there.

53:02.360 --> 53:04.920
I thought it would have more games on the screen at once.

53:04.920 --> 53:05.920
That's kind of interesting.

53:05.920 --> 53:06.920
Yeah, so.

53:06.920 --> 53:11.360
A real quick plug for the websites, E3 on PSP.com, Loki, you've been updating that like

53:11.360 --> 53:12.360
a mofo, right?

53:12.360 --> 53:13.360
Uh-huh, I've been trying.

53:13.360 --> 53:18.400
I've been getting behind a little bit, but I do have some stuff there from actually the

53:18.400 --> 53:22.240
Nintendo party that I attended, which should be good.

53:22.240 --> 53:24.520
So we got some pictures of that.

53:24.520 --> 53:26.040
Let's come back to that in a minute.

53:26.040 --> 53:28.640
Dark Soccer, what sites have you been working on?

53:28.640 --> 53:33.960
Actually, I did a little blogging today on stuff.orangelandradio.com.

53:33.960 --> 53:37.040
Yeah, I have a backlog I'm going to post there soon, too.

53:37.040 --> 53:43.480
I just happened to go up to the press room just to relax for a little bit, and I figured

53:43.480 --> 53:47.080
I'd go ahead and update the stuff blog, so there's my initial impressions there.

53:47.080 --> 53:52.680
That was everything up until I headed back, actually right before I ran into you guys

53:52.680 --> 53:57.160
when I was coming out of the west.

53:57.160 --> 53:59.160
I'm sorry I'm all backwards today.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.160
I'm sorry.

54:00.160 --> 54:05.840
So yeah, if you want to check out just what my impression was as of that moment, I have

54:05.840 --> 54:07.440
a few details there.

54:07.440 --> 54:15.720
I had just also checked out Guitar Room Man at that point, and also there's a discussion

54:15.720 --> 54:23.400
going on in our live journal community at orangeland.livejournal.com.

54:23.400 --> 54:24.400
You can get there.

54:24.400 --> 54:26.640
I'm sure there's stuff going up on our MySpace.

54:26.640 --> 54:33.160
I haven't looked at MySpace all week, and there's various other discussions that we're

54:33.160 --> 54:38.880
involved with at different locations, just depends on where you happen to find it.

54:38.880 --> 54:42.280
Bobby, there's a question backlogged from chat from five minutes ago.

54:42.280 --> 54:46.840
Yeah, it was like Boston asked if we've ever had any random bumping with celebrities, and

54:46.840 --> 54:49.000
you were with me, Rob, when we saw this.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.520
Oh, how desperate somebody is for a paycheck.

54:52.520 --> 55:00.600
We saw Gilbert Gottfried with G4 interviewing somebody in Kensha, and we're like, is he

55:00.600 --> 55:02.360
that desperate for a paycheck?

55:02.360 --> 55:03.440
I just rolled my eyes.

55:03.440 --> 55:04.640
I'm just like, I don't get it.

55:04.640 --> 55:06.440
I don't get G4 anymore, so whatever.

55:06.440 --> 55:10.440
I saw him in South Hall, and they were making him record, I guess, a bumper or something.

55:10.440 --> 55:12.440
He's all, I'm here at E3, man.

55:12.440 --> 55:15.720
I was supposed to be in Alaska or something like that.

55:15.720 --> 55:17.720
I was like, okay.

55:17.720 --> 55:25.320
The last thing I saw him do that wasn't an animated movie was USA Up All Night.

55:25.320 --> 55:26.320
Any other celebrity sightings?

55:26.320 --> 55:32.240
I don't know if this counts, but I got to meet Tommy Tallarico, thanks to Bobby.

55:32.240 --> 55:35.440
And Becky Young, who's smoking.

55:35.440 --> 55:38.720
Nice guy, but he had so much makeup on because he was doing the HDTV thing.

55:38.720 --> 55:42.280
Gameplay HD, which is on Voom, Disney Network.

55:42.280 --> 55:46.200
He looked like, who's that guy on Dancing with the Stars?

55:46.200 --> 55:48.200
George Hamilton?

55:48.200 --> 55:49.200
No, I'm teasing.

55:49.200 --> 55:50.200
He was very nice.

55:50.200 --> 55:51.200
I'm totally teasing.

55:51.200 --> 55:52.200
Very nice guy.

55:52.200 --> 55:54.200
Glad to meet him.

55:54.200 --> 55:56.200
Any other celebrity run-ins, you guys?

55:56.200 --> 56:03.000
I got to meet, well, I didn't get to meet him, but I saw the guy who worked on the DS

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Castlevania games.

56:05.000 --> 56:10.760
And then, as I'm actually showing Rob my picture right now, I had my meeting, well, not necessarily

56:10.760 --> 56:15.840
that I actually got to meet him other than to say thank you, but Koji Kondo, I got his

56:15.840 --> 56:16.840
autograph.

56:16.840 --> 56:26.000
And I happened to be at the press line for Nintendo when they were doing an interview

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
with Miyamoto.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.920
You've got a lot of great pictures there, Dark Sakura, you've got to get those on the

56:30.920 --> 56:31.920
site soon.

56:31.920 --> 56:37.040
I haven't figured out how to, because I'm actually using my, no, no, no, I don't want

56:37.040 --> 56:38.040
to do that.

56:38.040 --> 56:42.080
I'm actually using my camcorder as a camera, too.

56:42.080 --> 56:45.800
And I'm trying to get the picture to show Rob, there it is.

56:45.800 --> 56:46.800
Oh, Miyamoto!

56:46.800 --> 56:47.800
He's so goofy.

56:47.800 --> 56:53.320
I got a really good picture of Miyamoto, so that was really it.

56:53.320 --> 56:55.240
Loki, any other celebrity sightings for you?

56:55.240 --> 56:59.880
No, I didn't see anybody, I was looking, I didn't make it by the booth with Paris Hilton

56:59.880 --> 57:00.880
Disposal.

57:00.880 --> 57:01.880
Ah, fucker.

57:01.880 --> 57:08.040
Alright, going to chat room, chat.allgames.com for this week while we're live at the E3 Outpost.

57:08.040 --> 57:14.320
Xander wants to know, did we see In the Groove 2 consumer style, conspicuously absent from

57:14.320 --> 57:16.920
Red Octane's booth completely?

57:16.920 --> 57:18.720
All they have is Guitar Hero 2.

57:18.720 --> 57:22.840
I'll give you this, their booth is 50 times better than it was last year, but it's all

57:22.840 --> 57:23.840
Guitar Hero 2.

57:23.840 --> 57:26.840
They are not showing In the Groove in any capacity, so it's great.

57:26.840 --> 57:29.720
I didn't hear anything about the Activision deal either.

57:29.720 --> 57:30.720
You know what?

57:30.720 --> 57:31.720
You want to hear us?

57:31.720 --> 57:34.800
I overheard Activision people talking about the acquisition.

57:34.800 --> 57:39.360
As I was walking out of Kensha, I overheard Activision people talking about it.

57:39.360 --> 57:42.560
And they were just saying, they were just very happy about it.

57:42.560 --> 57:45.720
They were like, well, I'm glad we got them because someone was going to eventually, you

57:45.720 --> 57:47.520
know, it was basically the tone of the whole thing.

57:47.520 --> 57:50.760
So I don't know if I was supposed to hear that, but I did.

57:50.760 --> 57:52.800
Activision's very happy to be getting Red Octane.

57:52.800 --> 58:05.320
So oh, my God, the puppies on IGN.com, the Smash Brothers, oh, my Lord, but I lost my

58:05.320 --> 58:06.320
train of thought.

58:06.320 --> 58:07.320
It's alright.

58:07.320 --> 58:09.800
Damn you for distracting me with puppy.

58:09.800 --> 58:10.800
Sorry.

58:10.800 --> 58:14.680
Just a quick programming note for those that are listening live, if you're tuning in right

58:14.680 --> 58:18.920
now because you're expecting to hear gamer Andy, unfortunately, they're having technical

58:18.920 --> 58:22.480
difficulties will not be able to do a live broadcast tonight.

58:22.480 --> 58:27.000
He will be doing a podcast on his normal podcast stream.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
So check that out.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.280
However, all games interactive will be here live right after we wrap up in just a few

58:32.280 --> 58:33.280
minutes here.

58:33.280 --> 58:37.200
And there might be a lot of people on that, too, you know, I've got to pee so bad.

58:37.200 --> 58:42.280
I know it's excellent about this, but IGN has a thing about Super Smash Brothers Brawl

58:42.280 --> 58:43.280
in there.

58:43.280 --> 58:50.720
And they said it says actually that they wanted the decision to include Solid Snake is basically

58:50.720 --> 58:57.040
from when Kojima actually begged to have the Metal Gear character in the last Smash Brothers

58:57.040 --> 58:58.040
game.

58:58.040 --> 59:01.600
They said when asked about the possibility of Sonic the Hedgehog appearing in the game

59:01.600 --> 59:06.320
as well, they said there are possibilities for other third parties as well.

59:06.320 --> 59:12.400
And it may even maybe that even there are characters that might be included.

59:12.400 --> 59:17.240
But right now they're still, you know, in talks, so awesome.

59:17.240 --> 59:21.240
I was always hoping that they'd have a fighting game, including all the characters from different

59:21.240 --> 59:22.240
games.

59:22.240 --> 59:27.500
Well, the closest we had gotten before the Smash Brothers, well, there was Sonic the

59:27.500 --> 59:30.840
Fighters, which actually, you know, I didn't see that Sonic collection that they had last

59:30.840 --> 59:35.300
year where they had supposed to have all the old Saturn Sonic games.

59:35.300 --> 59:41.320
And all I got to say is if they make a new Kid Icarus game, that's going to look sweet.

59:41.320 --> 59:42.320
Oh, yeah.

59:42.320 --> 59:43.320
Wow.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.320
That looks great.

59:44.320 --> 59:45.320
Kid Icarus.

59:45.320 --> 59:46.320
Wow.

59:46.320 --> 59:47.320
We transitioned.

59:47.320 --> 59:54.520
Are we about ready to wrap up?

59:54.520 --> 59:55.520
Your producer left.

59:55.520 --> 59:56.520
Oh, it's all right.

59:56.520 --> 59:57.520
I'll go run and find him.

59:57.520 --> 59:58.520
OK.

59:58.520 --> 59:59.520
Thank you very much.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.720
We can just stay here for a little bit longer and be the fabulous Internet celebrities we

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720
are.

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:08.440
The Nintendo Party, I just got a I just got a call on the phone, so I got to make this

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.440
quick.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.440
OK.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.440
Let's hear about the Nintendo Party real quick.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.440
OK.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.440
So anyways, I went to the Nintendo Party.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.440
They had Black Eyed Peas playing.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.440
It was kind of interesting.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:21.680
I think those I missed the previous I didn't get to play games beforehand, but what's even

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:25.880
more interesting on the way there, I saw a runaway bus smashed through two cars and into

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.040
a telephone pole and then into a Rite Aid.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.040
So that was pretty awesome.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:38.520
Well, brutal, but the party wasn't really my thing because a lot of people I didn't

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.520
know there.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.400
But all the big names, I guess, were there, even from Nintendo, of course, no one had

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.400
a name badge or anything.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.080
So we didn't know who the hell it was, who all right.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:51.960
Well, that's going to do it about do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:52.960
at the E3 Outpost.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.160
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.160
Dark Sakura.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.960
I'd like to put out the funny deal that Captain N wasn't really an intended character.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.240
And the show sucked.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.440
So reject false icons.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.440
Final thought.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.440
Loki.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:15.240
Stay tuned on E3 on the PSP.com and definitely going to have a lot more stuff on there.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.420
I'm just kind of backlogged and getting everything on there, lots more videos and a lot more

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.420
everything.

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:22.560
So keep watching.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.840
Final thought, Mr. Bobby Black Wolf and plug your site already.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.180
BobbyBlackWolfShow.com.

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:33.080
We're going to have our E3 show is Friday night, 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific right

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.280
before OLR.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:39.000
But I hope all three of you at least show up for a couple minutes at least.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.860
And actually, you guys should check out the Tuesday night episode of All Games Interactive.

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:45.560
It has both Sky and Dark Sakura on it as well.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.560
Good times.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.560
Good times.

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:48.560
Yes.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.560
Debating with Scott Rubin was a good time.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.400
And you guys can do it again tonight after you pee.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.280
I've got to wee in the worst way.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.280
That's my final thought.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.280
30 minutes.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.960
It's a different nature game bar that Rob gave me, I haven't eaten since 10, so.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.960
I need to drink.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:02.960
All right.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:03.960
We're going to wrap it up here.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.640
For those of you guys listening live, stay tuned.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.000
All Games Interactive coming up in about 30 minutes.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
About 30.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.080
For those of you guys listening on the podcast feed, thank you for supporting Internet Radio.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.080
You guys are the best.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.280
We'll have another podcast here tomorrow live for the E3 Outpost.
