There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This week I got to play 2DX Heroverse on a lightning cabinet and it was amazing, there's a headphone jack!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
2DX is now up to date with every other active Imani game cabinet

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is the week's updated music gaming, join us for more details on the rest of the news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 810 for this February the 23rd of 2020

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts and yes we're back and we've even gotten our music game update there at the top of the show

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Thank you voice over guy Jason

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And joining me live in the studio of course DarkSakura who's showing off her food tonight

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I went to the broccoli farm, there's some broccoli

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There you go, live on our Twitch channel because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Twitch.tv slash VOG network or VOG network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Except oops we weren't here last week, sorry about that, reality is I had strep throat, it's as simple as that

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So when this show was going on last week or should have been going on last week I was getting tested for strep and getting an antibiotic

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And obviously that's a very highly contagious thing and y'all know that we tape this show in one of the rooms at my house

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So it would have been a very silly idea to have Jamie and of course Techmaster Loki who also sits here with me every week being exposed to that

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I would not like that

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah that would not be fun so and I know that's really unfortunate because I've been talking for a couple weeks about how we're not gonna be here the next two weeks

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oops because I'm gonna be on a cruise, you know I feel a little less bad about that though cause hello cruise

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But it is what it is, so essentially this is the only live show you're getting for a whole month, yikes I'm so sorry guys

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But we do appreciate all you guys that do turn up here every week and I will say this, we are looking at doing a show during the week next week

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I forgot to ask you before, are you free?

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah I should use yours

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes we're gonna tape something next week so that at least there will be something on the podcast feed and there will be something here to play

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
After Bobby Blackwolf on that would be March 1st if I did my math right

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So we'll have something there that night but then March 8th because I will still be, it's a 7 day cruise, I'll still be out at sea

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And we won't have had time to do something in advance so that will just be a dark week for the show

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So I really appreciate you guys but you know most shows that are, like you have to wait like a year and a half for a new season of Stranger Things

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay and so I'm going on a Star Trek cruise, we're season 3 of Discovery, it takes a little while so we do our best but real life gets in the way sometimes

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Sometimes it's because of sick, sometimes it's because of fun so there it is

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But yeah thank you guys for being here live tonight and joining us back here as we are live over at Twitch

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Or if you're on our podcast feed, however you are checking out the show

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I do want to get into our kickoff topic here and talk about some of the things that we missed in the last week

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But one, Loki I want to kind of pick on you first because one of the things we did miss by not having a show last week was

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Kind of the big headlines about how well the Sonic the Hedgehog movies were performing

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It was number one at the box office obviously but I believe they said it made more than Detective Pikachu

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's doing very well for a video game movie, I didn't check out how the second weekend went but I imagine

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Good

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Good I mean good for them so it's interesting because it really shows like wow them going back to the drawing board to fix it

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And maybe kicking it back to a time when there wasn't a lot of competition Valentine's Day weekend

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Like I think there was a romance movie out somewhere but those are going to be very different crowds, your family movie and your romance movie

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah there was like horror movies and I don't remember what else came out

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So you know you didn't really have like a Pixar film out or a Disney film out like those are coming out

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well Pixar actually that came out, I want to say that came out this week

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Maybe it's next week I don't know

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But regardless of all that the Sonic movie has been doing very well but as I mentioned I was very sick

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So there was no way I was going to go to a movie theater and see that

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Dar Sacher and I were supposed to have a date but for obvious reasons that didn't happen so we didn't get to go to the theater to see that

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But Loki I understood you went, you took the kids right?

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So how was it?

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It was great, I loved it

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It was a great Sonic movie like it's not, it wasn't terrible in the sense that you would think that like the human characters would be annoying and stuff

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I love Jim Carrey so I think they opened it up at the end for like you know what a sequel would be like and it's very exciting

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And it seems like almost a definite with how well it did to the box office and the sequel will happen

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And it's like listen we know what you guys want we're going to deliver with that and you know

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I could guess what it is without having seen the movie like I don't know but like I'm almost positive I know

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And all I'm going to say is what was the new thing in Sonic 2 versus Sonic 1 am I right?

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah I thought, I think so

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Split screen multiplayer that is what is coming in the next movie anyway

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But no they had like some funny like stuff like it's very aware of you know everything they did you know

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He eats chili dogs like he does in the cartoon series

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They had a picture this crazy old man who's seen him they called him like crazy I forget his name

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But like he drew a picture of what Sonic looked like he's like it's the blue devil and he has hold of a picture of Sanic

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay so there are like meme references

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Thank you for ruining all the good jokes in the movie no I'm kidding

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But well okay let me address that one criticism because you know I've been watching Twitter

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And the one criticism I have seen about the movie although most people I know kind of tend to overly enjoy it

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Although maybe I hear it's really more for kids and it doesn't really have like Detective Pikachu kind of had those balls that were lobbed at adults

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That only adults would get but Sonic doesn't really have those

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But the other thing is that the other big criticism I'm hearing is that all the good stuff was already given away in the trailers

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
A lot of it was in the trailers yeah

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah but that's kind of normal for a lot of movies right

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But it's fine you know some of it it's still okay I think

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It was still a decent movie

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well I hope to see it I mean the reality is with everything else I've had going on I don't know when I'll get to it

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But I'll go see it why not you know I enjoyed Detective Pikachu

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The video game movies have been on a roll lately so and I think the redesign of Sonic was done really well

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And you know if you're going to be out there complaining on the internet and they actually listen to you

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Then maybe you should go throw them some coin by going to pay to see the movie

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah I think so I mean and what I like about like even like they had

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Because you know Sega doesn't really make movies so they had to come up with their own sort of like logo thing to you know for like

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's a Sega movie you know but it was like so they had all the classic like 16-bit stuff and they're like oh yeah

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay that's what please tell me they had the voice Sega please tell me that voice was there

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Something like that yeah okay but it was alright

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's fine I don't we've given enough away I don't want to ruin the movie for people who haven't seen it yet

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But like myself you know there's some other fun stuff they did the trailer sequence which was all 16-bit

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Looked like the you know the Sonic game but it was all scenes from the movie I'm like ooh I want a game like that

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That'd be pretty cool

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Quick Jim Carrey though you're a huge Jim Carrey fan you have people may not know Loki is not a reference to the Marvel Universe

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Loki your name comes from the mask in that universe so that's where you kind of named yourself from

95
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because you've been a Jim Carrey fan for forever so this is like his first big movie in in a few years

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes it's a great like I'm back bitches was it kind of it's just you know it's classic Jim Carrey's so you know I think it's it was pretty good

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay I and you know like he definitely is a different take on Dr. Robotnik but like at the end you know he definitely starts looking like the character

98
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And like I could totally see him as you know it's it's perfectly fine now

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Interesting do you think that he's gonna do more movies now like now that that's he's kind of got his foot back in the door that's interesting

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I hope so

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah I hope so too

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Going to our chat because again we do tape live over at Twitch TV slash vog network VOG network every Sunday night

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Bonds 006 is in chat saying the film was freaking awesome and Tiger Claw says Jim Carrey has said he had a lot of fun doing this movie and wants to do more of them

104
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So I mean I don't think there is is there any other villain in the Sonic Universe besides Dr. Robotnik I mean he kind of has to come back

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They were actually originally thank god they didn't do it they're originally planning on a different villain like I don't even know what it was

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But then they also have like this other character that they came up with that is supposedly like Sonic's caretaker or something like that and that was kind of weird

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Like I don't remember this character anywhere any but whatever it's fine

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I never read the Archie comics or watched the animated one

109
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh Phoenix 7726 says Shadow the Hedgehog I guess that that could maybe be a direction they go in the sequel who knows good good call out

110
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But SH-100 Matt and I agree with this comment here in chat says they released it at the right time and I think that's very true

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Chaos

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh yeah chaos okay but anyway I think even though it was kind of a shit show when it first showed up in the early CG and everything

113
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I actually think them pushing it back to February kind of really ended up working in the favor

114
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I think the time you release a movie and what it goes up against is everything

115
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You know what's funny though is and I saw an article today about it is unfortunately the toys were made a little earlier

116
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh so the toys look like old Sonic

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I saw that too

118
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Uh oh oh wow what can you do

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Eh wah wah

120
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Wah wah

121
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's fine

122
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Alright okay well I just I had to get your thoughts on that I know Tigerclaw like has been waiting for like three weeks to hear

123
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Uh and unfortunately again I think y'all can give me an excuse on why I didn't see it and and Dark Sakura was to be my date so that's why she didn't see it either

124
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But I noticed that Loki had seen it I had to get your take on the Sonic movies

125
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And then I liked the you know I wish that because Junkie XL did the soundtrack for the movie and so like I was

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But yeah music's important how was that

127
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That was good like but I wish there was more music from the game in the movie they did like kind of a piano cover of the Green Hill Zone

128
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Um at one point

129
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Which is like some of my favorite music ever

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Towards the end and that was good but like throughout the movie it just didn't really feel like more Sonic music

131
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But I don't know um there's lots of potential

132
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Okay cool alright so Sonic movie yay

133
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Alright well let's move on I want to talk about before we get into like our gaming weeks and this week's news

134
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Let's talk a little bit about the big headlines we missed last week because I do feel like unfortunately you know the news cycle is what it is

135
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And I think we had a lot of big headlines last week and I think the headlines this week are only kind of big

136
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But we had some big things that happened last week so let's talk about some of the news that we missed last week

137
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So I would say by far the biggest headline that was dropped last week that we didn't really get to address was

138
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Um Jeff Keighley piecing out at E3 2020

139
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That was like that was a um when I read that on Twitter that was a literal jaw drop

140
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I was like wow

141
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So he has basically voiced that he's not going to E3 2020

142
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He's not going to be producing um his carnival sideshow

143
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And I'm being very bad with my description

144
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But he's not going to be doing that sideshow at E3 this time

145
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So um yeah what's what's what's going on

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Like that's that's really bad for E3 in my opinion to see Jeff Keighley kind of saying pieces do yeah

147
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And then I want to say like I don't remember the details

148
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But he had like um like people were asking him questions on Twitter about it

149
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And he was just talking about like he didn't like the direction that the show was going or something like that

150
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So there was like without actually calling out what the exact reason was he kind of hinted at some things

151
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But I don't know what that exactly means

152
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I guess we'll have to see but it's not a good sign when you have a lot of people that were kind of helping bring interest to it dropping out of it

153
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let me ask a very simple question and I open this up to our chatters as well

154
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
They're watching live tonight on Twitch

155
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you had the power to realistically make changes at E3 and I'm saying realistically okay

156
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't you know try to try to temper your your budget ideas

157
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What can the ESA what can E3 do at this point to kind of save itself because I think there's a lot of us going yikes

158
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is really not looking good

159
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I mean essentially we're headed towards this is going to be the Microsoft conference with the Nintendo Sideshow

160
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You know going on this year and I only put and I know some may take issue with me calling Nintendo a sideshow

161
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm only relegating them to that status because Microsoft has the new console

162
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Therefore they're gonna have plenty of new games this year and Nintendo has already said no new hardware for 2020

163
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So that is why I've said that so if you're a Nintendo fan just please deal with that for a minute

164
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But as far as you know E3 what do you think can be done at this point? What does the ESA need to do to shift course on this?

165
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
They need to give Paris Hilton a call so she can come back with her new cell phone

166
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
John Cena needs to come back

167
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
No, I don't I don't think so, I don't really know if there's anything they can do it's just I think

168
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's not I mean, yeah sort it's it's not really I think the problem

169
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It has an identity crisis with it doesn't know what exactly it's trying to be. And so that's the problem

170
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's not good at any of the things it's trying to because it's supposed to be like an industry gathering that

171
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's when you you know, you work with your retailers about like what your product plans are gonna be and like

172
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You know get them excited about stuff that's coming out and you at the same time

173
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You know consumers are learning about things as well

174
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But it was mainly a concern, you know an industry show a trade show and now it's like well now

175
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,840
it's a you know, what's a show for fans to come but then like I

176
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,500
Don't know. It's like well, then how are they gonna get stuff done now?

177
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,120
and it's just and then you have all these companies dropping out and I

178
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,320
Mean, I guess you could highlight Indies more

179
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,960
That's funny because a lot of chatters are echoing that and I want to get to that in just a minute

180
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,940
That's like packs. I mean before I get to that. I think I think you're right on the money. Is that

181
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,080
Pax is having a crisis e3 is having a major identity crisis

182
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,280
And I think the first thing they need to figure out is what are we?

183
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,640
What because we've tried we're not we've now been trying to put our fingers in every pie because we're having an identity crisis

184
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,880
You know, do we need to let the public in do we not are we only for the media?

185
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,860
Are we not like what I think the first thing III needs to figure out is what are we?

186
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,320
Stick to it

187
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,960
even if it's gonna maybe piss some of the fans off because the fans will still always have that unless e3 decides we want to

188
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:59,000
Be a competition with packs then go all-in on that, you know with with some of these other suggestions about like Indies and so forth

189
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,480
Yeah, then if you're gonna do like the packs route then, you know

190
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,720
you need to get like start having some keynotes or more you already kind of do keynotes, but like have like

191
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,080
Discussion tracks that you can go to and like, you know talk to developers and you'll kind of like GDC or something

192
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,780
Literally be packs. I mean that's kind of our yeah

193
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
I don't know. It's just I

194
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,900
Like all the news being around one little area and I like that. It's an exciting time of the year

195
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,000
I understand that. Yeah, it sucks you with everything

196
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,400
it's not very convenient for people to go and see stuff and

197
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,720
you know other companies are figuring out that they can do have more coverage with

198
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,080
having their events at different times and like separate from everything but

199
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,560
I still like the old way, you know with everything being there, but yeah, I get it. I understand

200
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,640
Um, I want to read some of these comments in chat because I think there's a really good idea here

201
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,540
I want to laser focus on a little bit

202
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:00,160
Some of the comments in chat was SSJ 100 Matt says cancel e3 for a few years and restructure

203
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,560
Make it more indie friendly is one of the things I can think of

204
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,120
Barbie Britney 84 in our chat says I think they need to pivot this into an indie showcase this year

205
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,200
But it used to have an indie showcase but it was called Kensha Hall

206
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,600
That's right

207
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,800
The problem with it being an indie showcase is indie showcase doesn't pay the bills for that location or anything else

208
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,760
So that's why what they need to do is figure out how to like get these other companies that are leaving

209
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,720
You know make it worth their while but I don't think that they're gonna figure that out and then just got fall apart

210
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,640
I kind of respectfully do think that indie is the answer. That's what I would go everybody else does it better though?

211
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,760
I get the whole you've got to be able to pay the bills and so forth

212
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,680
There's got to be that balance

213
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,320
But let me let me let me take a step back as to why why did I get sick at you three?

214
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,680
Why did I stop going to e3 like, you know?

215
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,720
Let's let's just analyze that for a minute cuz that that's something I can take a look at and go

216
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,880
Why did I stop going to e3 because everybody is saying well your media even though e3 says your media?

217
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,120
You're not you're not good enough media for us

218
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,640
That is a huge part of it

219
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,660
And even when I would finally justify myself to get into a conference to get into an interview to get into whatever

220
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:14,120
I was seeing the same shit that was on YouTube later that evening or like I will the thing that like if I could put

221
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,720
My finger on like one instance that broke e3 for me

222
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:23,120
It was when I waited at Ubisoft and I had to sit there and justify

223
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,700
Why I was even at e3 to this person at Ubisoft and this whole like, you know

224
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:34,260
What the podcast is and all that stuff to go in to see this Assassin's Creed thing, which isn't even a series

225
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,180
I'm like usually super into but like get me excited about it, right?

226
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,620
So finally I go in I see the thing and then later that night. It's all there on YouTube

227
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,140
So it's like why did I fight with this person?

228
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:51,060
To try to get into this screening when it's like it's not even that secret what it's not even a big deal

229
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,060
What you're showing you're putting it out there for everybody

230
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,580
like that was like the moment when I was like man III this is this show is getting ridiculous and

231
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,340
I love Kensha Hall. That was great. Let's be real. Kensha Hall was closed ten years

232
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,300
I understand time

233
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,140
but I think there is something about bringing that back and my point is a

234
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:14,860
Lot of like the interviews a lot of the things you would see at e3 over the years have been we're sticking to a script

235
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,860
We're sick sticking to the same old line

236
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,920
We have the do you remember when vog network for those who have been here for a little while would do those?

237
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,680
Go ask the we're gonna go chase down the answers to your questions

238
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,360
Like it was honestly like not to toot my own horn

239
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,280
But because Bobby was a big part of this too

240
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,240
But the idea in its concept was brilliant and the first year it worked pretty well the second year

241
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,000
It didn't work and Bobby almost got thrown out of Nintendo's booth because he was asking these questions that were like off script

242
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
for the the the

243
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,360
People that were hired to answer the questions and they were like essentially he could tell you more about this and I'm sure he already

244
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,120
Isn't chat, but they were essentially like sir. You need to stop asking so many questions, basically, and I think I'm sorry

245
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
That's that is you need to stop asking questions

246
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,400
Sir, we're gonna have to we don't like the tone of your inquisition

247
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
So my point he can tell the story better than I can but my point is

248
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,400
You know who is gonna be ready to answer questions, you know who wants to talk about gaming, you know who loves gaming

249
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,960
You know who can bring that excitement back to e3?

250
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:23,480
Indies and that is why I totally agree that Indy is the path to try to get e3 to be fun

251
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,480
again is they get the people there who want to talk about their games and

252
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,120
Love to answer stupid questions because people are talking about their game

253
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,720
That's that's the fun and excitement e3 needs again

254
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,500
And if Sony doesn't want to be that developer then you can quote me on this

255
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,460
Mm-hmm

256
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,780
Fuck them get some Indies in there who will talk about their stuff

257
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:52,980
I bet there's lots of great indie developers making stuff on Sony's platform that will talk about their game

258
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,220
That's why I like going to the GDC after parties. I don't go to GDC. I go to parties

259
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,620
Exactly meet people who love what they do

260
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:07,540
yeah, exactly for the last couple years how much time during Sony's press conferences were dedicated to the last of us and

261
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,380
games like that

262
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:15,220
Versus dreams that just came out which has literally no fanfare to it at all

263
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:23,200
But is such an amazing thing that nobody is talking about and it will die a quiet death because nobody is talking about it

264
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,720
Bobby black wolf is telling the story here. It is. Yes. It was Mario maker. They actually didn't like my tone

265
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,520
I was asking questions and they said sorry, you're not recognized media

266
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,820
You can play the demo but do not ask our booth attendants any questions

267
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,220
The person managing that little area told me it was probably best if I walked away after my demo

268
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,380
Wow, I mean

269
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:51,140
Okay, if you want to talk about why e3 fucking sucks as it is right now

270
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,980
Where's where's that Will Smith picture?

271
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,660
There it is like print it put it on the back of the box that is it

272
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,380
So that attitude?

273
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,200
Needs to change if e3 is gonna be successful again

274
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:14,940
Get excited about your fucking games get people that want to talk about games make gaming fun again

275
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,540
It's just that simple

276
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,560
Anyway

277
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,560
What other stories do we miss last week how was one of medley many headlines

278
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,140
Let's see, so what else

279
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
What there's a bit about?

280
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:37,300
WWE 2k 20 right apparently didn't sell didn't sell well and there's there's yeah about that right? It's sold poorly

281
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,980
Apparently well, I mean it was a broken ass game

282
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,100
so

283
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:49,220
There's that when people hear that your game is broken as shit. They probably aren't too likely to buy it. I

284
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,260
Don't know works they're disappointed that

285
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,980
WWE 2k 20 did not meet our expectations both in terms of sale and quality quality

286
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:06,420
You don't say you fucking knew what state it was in when you release the shit, so don't give me this

287
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,860
Yeah, we we're so caught off guard. Oh my god

288
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,060
like I

289
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,980
Just they knew what the fuck they're doing oops

290
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:22,840
Let's see another big story from last week February 19th. We had some new updates for the switch online service

291
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,680
So the classic emulation service including pop and Twinbee, so maybe something up dark soccer is how did you not know?

292
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,680
That's on switch now. Yes, the dark soccer just lit up like what?

293
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,800
So pop and Twinbee is there? Yeah, it must be it must be

294
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,440
peel-peel

295
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,480
Sega Aegis is coming out. Oh on this way. That's right. Well, there's a lot of Sega Aegis stuff already on switch

296
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,960
They've got a lot of good stuff

297
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,960
Smash tennis also was released

298
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,240
Eliminator boat duel and shadow of the ninja which actually that one

299
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,720
Shadow of the ninja is one of those games like you probably haven't heard of it

300
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,520
But you should go check it out because it was like one of those like 8-bit like classics that like it was a hipster game

301
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,520
Like not a lot you probably never played this but like it's really good. So it's it's worth checking out

302
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:13,240
So there's there's some decent little like gems in there, but we're still not seeing the huge hitters, you know

303
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,840
But we'll see we'll see how much they can

304
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,080
Continue to add on to that and then I guess one more here. I think this is a huge story from last week

305
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,880
Bubble bobble for friends. That's right bubble bobble for

306
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,620
Got listed by Amazon for a North American release coming up this next week on March 4th

307
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,780
So, I don't know if that has officially been announced since then or what have you but it looks like we may have a new

308
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,780
Bubble bobble gaming coming and that's a lot of fun, right?

309
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,100
So, yep, all right, so there you go anything else from last week, I don't think we need to really say anything else

310
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,380
Yeah, let's get into how was your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been playing this week

311
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,940
And then we'll get into this week's headlines. So dark soccer. I'll start with you. How was your gaming week?

312
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,220
It involves some of the Kunio things

313
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,400
I didn't exactly play it but because Dan and Jeffrey were playing a crapload of it

314
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,860
It also involved trying to teach Julian how to play ghouls and ghosts

315
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,980
Which

316
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:15,940
The Genesis mini it's got some emulation issues and timing response problems. So when Dan went to go play again on

317
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:23,060
The CDX on a legit cart. He had no problems beating the game this morning. So

318
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,660
but yeah, we introduced the boy to that and we introduced him to Streets of Rage 2 as

319
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:36,340
You should and the joy that is a soundtrack by Yuzo. I was just about to say and hopefully you have burned him a CD

320
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,740
The soundtrack or whatever what whatever we did on Spotify. What are the kids do today?

321
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,260
I don't know

322
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:46,620
We did also show him the bare-knuckle arcade machines that were in there and told him yeah

323
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,500
That was the original name of the first one was bare knuckles. This is bare knuckle, too

324
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,640
So you got posters with had bk2 on it

325
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,260
And he thought that was pretty cool

326
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,500
and

327
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,880
Then you know, usually it's just this week has been my phone stuff. I

328
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,880
started

329
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,040
Installing some more mods for Sims and then I was like, yeah, I kind of don't feel like it just because

330
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
I had a four-day weekend

331
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,360
and

332
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,640
I don't get those and so I went outside and played reality for a little while. I

333
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,960
It's not a new camera

334
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,240
I mean, I know I've told everyone Dan's mom died, but Dan came home with something for me from her possessions, which is a

335
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,440
1977 Minolta Heimatic camera Oh fun. It's a rangefinder, you know click wind all that

336
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,320
And I was like, so I decided to take it out and kind of do a little tribute

337
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,000
Did you end up doing the Pokemon go community day yesterday?

338
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Cuz I imagine you asked me to do that, but I had family

339
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,400
No, we didn't really do the community day stuff cuz Becky wanted to come to and Julian was with us

340
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,440
he promised not to complain about anything, but he complained anyway, and then got hangry and

341
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,400
then but I showed him where the arcade was in stage 9 and

342
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,840
And

343
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,440
There was a dude playing punch-out and Julian was like, you know kind of that was cool. He's cool kid

344
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,080
He wants come back on the show. So I said when we're back, how old is he like 12 now, right?

345
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,640
He's gonna be 13 in April. Wow. He's that age. I can't call him. Mr. Boy anymore. He is now young sir. Yeah

346
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,720
So, I don't know when he is not so young of a sir anymore

347
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,760
But that he can be young sir for the or I might call him a teenage menace. I don't know. All right

348
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,140
Well, yeah, we'll definitely have to get him back on the show at some point. That'll be fun

349
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:33,840
But at any rate, you know, it's just my usual phony stuff and I'm still playing

350
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,600
Patterned on my Mac a lot of patterned. I love that game. Cool. All right. Well, if that's it for dark Sakura

351
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,500
Let's go over to Loki. How was your gaming week? So I played Orna and I'm up to level 135 now, so

352
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,080
Nice, good work

353
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,280
It's so funny

354
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:55,320
Watching you like bring up Orna here at this place and you only see the two buildings because I'm gonna show you what it really

355
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,440
looks like

356
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:04,120
There's like so many buildings. You can't see but yeah, so oh no. No, I understand like at my house I have

357
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,860
That's what it really looks like. Oh that that

358
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,920
That that's silly that that that oh

359
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,840
Geez, yeah, I have like let's see in front of my house

360
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,020
I've got a keep I've got there happens to be a naturally a one of the

361
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,260
Arcanists or whatever is there and then I have a blacksmith

362
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
a bestiary and I

363
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Think

364
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,440
11 or 12 shops

365
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,480
It is pretty cool that you can build your own stuff

366
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,120
Like imagine if you could like build your own pokey stops and Pokemon go which I get you can kind of do that

367
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,600
But not really but I mean like just as easy as like clicking a button and putting it down like that's pretty cool

368
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:40,800
Yeah

369
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:46,280
So 11 or 12 shops because I I'm trying to get earth stone for my weapon

370
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:52,480
They have and so in order to be able to have that stuff cycle out also arena tokens monster remains and stuff like that

371
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,760
So they're all level 10 and then I just have a ton of them. So their inventory constantly refreshes

372
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,020
So yeah, I played a lot of that and then I did play things other than Orna though

373
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
actual games so I

374
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,680
Of course after the show or shortly after the show I was playing

375
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,920
Yyrs game so that oh, yeah sharpshooter was cute. Yes. That's fine

376
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,280
I played sharpshooter quite a bit buy that this week you guys support why we are on the team

377
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,320
so I played that and then I

378
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,720
also

379
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,120
decided because I've been toying around with setting up a

380
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,960
Minecraft bedrock server

381
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,160
But I didn't want to go through the hassle of setting that all up

382
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,480
So I just I decided to try their realms that they have

383
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,420
So minecraft realms for those who don't know they have realm

384
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,000
Pro is what they call it now and it's up to 10 10 people can join your realm

385
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,140
It's basically on any of the Xbox switch PC

386
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:55,500
Android iOS versions, I think PlayStation 4 supported now as well, maybe

387
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,140
but anyways, you can set up it's like a

388
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:06,900
server sort of and you can dump whatever level you want in there and you can do even like the

389
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,780
Minecraft shop mods are not really mods like behavior packs and

390
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,860
Graphics packs, but we didn't do any of that stuff. We just kept it vanilla

391
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,820
Minecraft

392
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,900
so I just dumped in a

393
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,740
Level that I found the seed that's fork and shirt balls

394
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:33,060
It's great. It's got two villages right there when you first spawn in so we started that and then did some stuff

395
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:38,820
So my kids and I have been playing basically on a server for like the last couple days and they just love it being able

396
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,900
To play together. So, you know, my one sons on the switch the other ones on his PC and then I'm on my PC

397
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,940
So it worked out pretty cool

398
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,880
So I've been doing that and then

399
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,300
What else?

400
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,360
Didn't work on my game this week because I was playing Minecraft instead because

401
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:01,540
They were complaining because he fell into lava or something and died and so he lost all his diamond stuff

402
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:05,220
So I had to go mine some more diamonds for him

403
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,460
So they eventually I got fed up with it and I put cheats on and I turned

404
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,020
Keep inventory when you die off and then fall damage off

405
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:18,520
So now they don't die as often or if they do die they keep all their stuff so they don't have to complain anymore

406
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,300
But yeah, it's been a lot of fun and I'm enjoying my craft

407
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:28,980
I do wish that the nether update was on the bedrock edition, but that'll come later. I'm sure and

408
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,180
I don't know if I like this enough

409
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,900
Maybe I will end up actually setting up a server but like I don't really know with bedrock

410
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,580
Stuff like who would be a good server host and in the cost of that stuff

411
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,580
It just kind of varies a lot

412
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:51,780
And so I don't know which service to go with whereas I would assume that Microsoft probably can handle that shit with their stupid

413
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,820
Servers so so far. I haven't had a problem

414
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,500
So we'll stick with that for now

415
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,640
And that's pretty much it. All right, my gaming week

416
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,620
So obviously the strep situation kind of knocked me out for a little bit

417
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:11,640
But I've still been playing the the phone games ingress has a fielding event thing going on right now for like a limited time badge

418
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,580
But honestly like there with with all the sickness

419
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,500
I was there was no way I was gonna be able to get I think you have to get like 800 fields in 10 days

420
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,940
Yeah, there was no way I was gonna do that

421
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,400
I just you know there came a point where I'm like you I'm just gonna have to set the bar low

422
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,800
So I went the bronze just so I can have the badge on my my profile

423
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,380
Which was a hundred fields and that was not so bad that I kind of get that in just my normal day-to-day play and just

424
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,580
Like micro fielding the nearby parks is pretty easy to get that. So I got that badge and that was plenty enough for me

425
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:46,940
But I hit level 15 on my second time around so I did that too. Yay. So have they given you anything for no

426
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,060
They haven't no they have not and that's too bad

427
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,900
I'm gonna not hold my breath and say that they're they you're not doing anything

428
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,260
I mean

429
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,580
It's still I still am into it for like the social stuff like the team did a really big triangle that covered San Francisco in

430
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,100
San Jose and it kind of ran through like the Delta in this area

431
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,660
So like we had to go out and clear that area. So yeah, it was fun

432
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,900
But anyway, I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon go like just a little I'm trying to get back into that

433
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,580
I'm super not into the PvP. I really don't care about the PvP

434
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,820
I would have done community day, but I had a family obligation yesterday today would have been my mom's birthday

435
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,500
So dedicating tonight's episode to my mother who would have been 79 today. But anyhow

436
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,900
We I had my little Bluetooth the pokeball plus with me

437
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:34,580
So I did like on the drive to Roseville, I just caught via Bluetooth and I got one shiny

438
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,140
So honestly one shiny Rhinehorn, I'll take it when I was expecting zero. So that was good

439
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:45,060
Final Fantasy 14 got a major patch. So Final Fantasy 14 is running on 5.2 now, which added some new things

440
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,060
so there's a new dungeon that I've been doing and

441
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,700
Some of my friends like Shane and some of the people I play with on there are now obsessed with the fishing boat

442
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,540
So there's now a fishing boat kind of like what you know

443
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,780
Remember in Final Fantasy 11, you could take the boat from Selbina to like

444
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,420
Mahara or something like that and there was like a boat

445
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,660
So now they have kind of something like that except it's a fishing boat

446
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:09,880
So you just go on it to fish and it's a great way to level fishing and I don't know why everybody's obsessed with it

447
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,580
But once in a while you trigger the rainbow and everybody freaks out because the rainbow makes you fish super fast

448
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,620
So it's fun. Anyway, silly thing but good and then here's the other big game

449
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,420
I've been playing a lot of this game in the past two weeks. So it has been no show

450
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,980
And this is one of those games that's kind of like on again off again for me

451
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,360
But I am back on this game and I am on this game

452
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:37,740
Harder than I've ever been before and that game is no man's sky. I am

453
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,300
Obsessed right now with it. Like I have been playing the shit out of that game

454
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,540
I have played I'm furthering at that game than I have any of my other play playthroughs

455
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,900
I've unlocked gold trophies at this point

456
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:56,800
So, I mean some of them got a lot easier to do like the gold trophy for meeting aliens is really easy now because

457
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,740
Now that you run into like ten aliens per space station that you go to it's very easy to get that

458
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,140
But I got the gold trophy for making two million credits

459
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,060
Because I lucked out and in my starter universe that I started on a new file on PlayStation 4

460
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,780
I ended up with an Alan was super into that game for a while

461
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,660
So when I show I was like Alan what the hell is this planet and it was a planet that was a it

462
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:23,100
Alan said it's like a Death Star because it's made completely out of metal and it's all

463
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:28,000
Hexagons on the floor and then all the bushes are in like hexagon shapes there

464
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,400
There's a very unique looking planet and I never seen anything like it and Alan said oh, yeah

465
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,560
Sometimes you get these rare spawn planets that look completely different and I was like, that's fucking cool

466
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,780
And so, you know what I did with that planet

467
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:47,120
I built a fucking base on it because it was so cool and plus the other plus about that planet is that it's got like

468
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:53,840
Gold and silver and all this other stuff like out the wazoo and I built my base right by these things called metal fingers

469
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,600
That will respond every few days. They give you a ton of uranium and gold

470
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,640
So anyway, I'm getting a little deep in the weeds with no-man's sky

471
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,960
But like it really motivated me to keep going on the game because I had access to all these materials

472
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,720
And so yeah, have you tried in VR yet? Um, I did previously on one of my playthroughs and it was neat

473
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,000
But it wasn't neat enough for me to always play in VR

474
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,900
Like I was just kind of like I don't want to say it feels tacked on because I did like the experience

475
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,880
But I just prefer the traditional monitor or TV experience with headphones. Yeah, it's a little better for me

476
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,760
I'm not that VR is bad. It's just you know, I just I

477
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,320
When I play something like no-man's sky I can get into that for like three hour place

478
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,120
Do they have cross play on that or is it just all they don't?

479
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,960
Separate on PC and PlayStation 4 and Xbox has it too. So it is separated

480
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
But you know, it's it's okay

481
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,600
So what's interesting is I've been completely selfishly naming my galaxies

482
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,880
So what I did is my first galaxy was I think I called it Appletini

483
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,240
So a and then all the planets were a planet so I know my rare planet is called abacus

484
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,320
Was the the rare one that I found and then I went to I think boop

485
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,560
Galaxy was next and it only had one planet so I called it beep

486
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,120
So you have beep and boop and then I did C and D so I'm all the way up through I

487
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,880
I just landed in the eye galaxy that are for me because I've done two black holes now

488
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,840
So that's taking me to the eye galaxy that I think I called

489
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,160
The chorus or something like that after kid Icarus, so yeah, so, um, that's that's where I'm at right now

490
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,540
So I'm having so much fun with no-man's sky. It's so like weird but like oh man, there's this one planet

491
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:40,220
I found that was called a desolate planet and it was a desolate planet. There was nothing else

492
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,700
Well, it was like landing on the moon or something where there's like nothing there

493
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,620
It's just rock, but I got them like check my Twitter feed

494
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:51,740
This is not just a cheap plug for my Twitter, but maybe it is at mr. Rob Roberts. Mr. Rob Roberts

495
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:57,180
I took the most beautiful screenshot in that game and people were like asking me like what game is this?

496
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,580
This is a gorgeous. I'm like, this is no-man's sky and this is what it really looked like

497
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,020
So what happened is I was in desolate planet

498
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,460
but it was just it was just enough where there was a

499
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:12,620
Saturn looking planet like right in the horizon and a moon right behind it and then the Sun was like just it was it was

500
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,420
A gorgeous picture and I was just like this is this is art

501
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,660
Games are art

502
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:25,860
So was it a desolate planet in the sense that there's none of those stupid robots that like get pissed off when you mind stuff

503
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:32,420
Yeah, there are there are planets where there are very few or even no sentinels. I think the desolate the sentinels

504
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,020
The desolate planet had no sentinels

505
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,500
And but there isn't as much to get there's there's no plants and no animals

506
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,740
So it's just it was interesting. So I anyway, I just I'm

507
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,820
The no-man's sky has really filled that space for me that I think a Minecraft type game would

508
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,700
Where I just go play it when I want my moment of Zen

509
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,820
I just want to go explore some planets and now that they've added more to the game where it's like

510
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,660
I'm just gonna open up the game and do some missions at the base

511
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,860
I don't want to do any kick cuz there's missions that are like go kill sentinels. Yeah, fuck them

512
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,060
No, but you don't have to do those missions

513
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,020
You just say you know what?

514
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:12,700
I'm gonna do the ones that are scanned five minerals and take the item to the lost person on the planet

515
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,320
She had a mode in the game where I can just turn those stupid tonight. Well, I do those so

516
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,160
I think there is like a creative mode where you can't die. Don't quote me on that though

517
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,260
But I just play on like the regular mode and it's fine, but the sentinels did try to fuck me up

518
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,740
they will fuck you up if you try to raid a

519
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:35,020
Ruin like I took a giant glowing ball like it was some Indiana Jones shit. Like I took the ball

520
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,980
I'm like ooh shiny

521
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,740
This is mine and then the sentinels are like alert alert cuz they have like a Grand Theft Auto

522
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,380
Style meter now, so that took me up to three strikes on the meter

523
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,860
And I had to just run to the plane and I Oh fucked out of there

524
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,900
So it was it was pretty great

525
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:54,740
So yeah, like a giant universe yet somehow all of these robots are in every single stupid planet on an entire universe

526
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,780
Yeah, so I loved it. I loved it so much. So I'm

527
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:03,540
I'm really excited about I have breaking news Oh what Brie Larson is a fan of Animal Crossing Oh

528
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,060
She's been posting about it on Twitter

529
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:11,020
She has good taste Brie Larson one at one of the famous people from Sacramento on that list

530
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,380
And I said I'm hereby inviting you to visit my island on March 20th

531
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,020
Was it Brie Larson?

532
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,180
Jessica Chastain

533
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,900
Mandisa from that one season of American Idol

534
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,820
Tim Schmidt from the Eagles

535
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,780
Tom Hanks his kid not Tom Hanks, but his kid Colin Hanks and that yeah, and then us

536
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,620
Yeah, cuz Colin Hanks did that documentary about Tower Records, which is no Tower Records is also very

537
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,340
Timothy Schmidt lives in Sacramento is the

538
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,580
basis for the Eagles

539
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:47,020
Star Trek reference. So does Tim Russ to buck was a Sacramento guy and LeVar Burton

540
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:53,080
Hello, can't forget LeVar Burton speaking of Star Trek. He wasn't born here, but they named a park after him

541
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:58,960
I remember that I love playing Pokemon go at LeVar Burton Park. There's something very very satisfying about that

542
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,860
Anyway, all right, that's enough about our gaming weeks

543
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,000
Let's get into some of the news from this week because we've had an awful lot going on and I just remembered that dark soccer

544
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,460
I can't stay for the whole show. So I need to make sure we get to the classic

545
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,520
What time are you here till tonight? Sorry to do this live, but I forgot

546
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,520
Okay, we'll get to classic game by 8 for sure so okay, I'm I'm fine

547
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,560
Let's get into some headlines tonight Loki. So Sony's all about backing out of events

548
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,720
So, you know to join e3 and them not being there

549
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:33,840
They're also backing out of PAX East due to increased concerns related to the corona virus

550
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,320
You know, they said we felt set I felt this was the safest option as the situation is changing daily

551
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,000
We're disappointed to cancel our participation in the event

552
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,600
But the health and safety of our global workforce is of our highest concern and of course

553
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:57,720
You know packs basically said that you know while we are saying that Sony will no longer have a presence in PAX East 2020

554
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:05,040
We look forward to welcoming our friends at Sony to future packs events and our focus on making PAX East 2020 a

555
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,960
Successful and enjoyable event for all attendees and exhibitors. How about shitty excuse for we don't wanna I

556
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
I

557
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,040
Tried

558
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,840
Well, I I want I don't know if it's if they have like some sort of just like travel thing cuz I I want to say

559
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,000
That there's other companies that are also backing up as because of that there are I'm Square Enix

560
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,640
And I don't know if you were gonna talk about that

561
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,920
But Square Enix is also mentioned that they're not going to be I know I'm never gonna find out about Final Fantasy 11

562
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:38,160
Goddamn it ever and I should say it's that some of the staff is not gonna be like I think Square Enix is still gonna

563
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,160
But they're not gonna like the 11 staff and the 14 staff are not coming out damn it

564
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:48,100
And so when I heard the Sony thing, my brain was still kind of there where I was like, okay

565
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:55,280
It's not this hysteria about like one person in Boston has the the novel coronavirus or kovat 19

566
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,680
If you will is I think the like official

567
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,680
Health Association name so I'll try to call it kovat but

568
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,840
It's not so much that but it was like oh these people traveling from Japan

569
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:13,280
They might have to be routed through, you know, some of these other countries to make their connections to get to a place like Boston

570
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,340
They might have to go through a Hong Kong or something like that to do that and maybe not everybody wants to do that

571
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,160
So I was kind of like well

572
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,700
Maybe I can kind of give the benefit of the doubt in that scenario

573
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,040
But I was listening to Bobby before us tonight and he did bring up an excellent point that is very true about trade shows

574
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:34,040
especially when it comes to a company like Sony and that is like the the Sony booths and stuff are usually staffed with

575
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,200
Almost all like temps and locals and you know

576
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:45,120
The best way I could explain this to folks is like you remember the booth babe controversy, you know, where do boot?

577
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:52,840
Where do they come from booth babes come from? Let's see. Let's answer this question. Mommy. Where do booth babes come from?

578
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,480
Okay, so booth babes are usually and you guys know like look, you know

579
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,880
I'm using that term very tongue-in-cheek and I think we all know that the booth babe has been scaled back and there's booth dudes now

580
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,440
And there's just you know, it's it's all about with eye candy booth people. Okay, it's booth people organic eye candy

581
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,080
Yeah, sure. Um, so here's the thing. So I'm using booth babe very tongue-in-cheek

582
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:19,980
You guys all know that so the booth babes are usually hired through like a temporary agency

583
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,560
That sometimes could actually especially when it comes to LA and e3 could be tied to a modeling agency

584
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,460
Like believe it or not. It's not just with video games

585
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:34,640
There are lots of companies that do lots of different trade shows that love to have their booths staffed with attractive

586
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,700
Individuals to demo their product

587
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:42,260
so what usually happens in the three days or four days leading up to a show a trade show like III these

588
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,620
temps go through a very

589
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:49,980
Intense learning Sarah thing to you know, and this kind of leads into why they never went off script at e3

590
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,820
Right because they are they're taught the script in these few days and then they're there to demo the games and the product and all

591
00:43:54,820 --> 00:44:01,180
That good stuff that's what what the booth babes are all about and it's actually I would think it's a lot of the booth

592
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:05,660
Babes are like college kids and it's a great side gig

593
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:11,400
It's a fucking great side income because it's something you don't have to do, you know permanently and it's it's a side thing

594
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:17,580
So like, you know, it paychecks for booth babes, right? But anyway, the reason why I say all that is because

595
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:23,020
They're not gonna be flying in a bunch of people from Asia. They staff their booth with

596
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:30,800
Cody fingers booth babes or the the model I would still think that there may be some staff there, but maybe minimal

597
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,260
yeah, so

598
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:40,220
So anyway, my point is is that they could fully staff a booth now bringing in the staff from Asia

599
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:48,300
You know maybe out of out of an abundance of caution or maybe if somebody that works for Sony quite simply said

600
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,240
I don't want to do it, you know

601
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,600
Whether we think they're being hysterical or not

602
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,240
Nobody should have to do anything against their will so fine

603
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:00,160
If somebody didn't want to come to PAX because they just don't want to go outside fine. That's their choice

604
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,960
I respect that but it does seem like pulling out of the entire show where it's like no booth at all

605
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,480
Nothing to do or see here that does feel a bit extreme

606
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,160
Especially when there's one person in all of Boston and they know who it is. Are we as paxies right now?

607
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,200
I believe it's next weekend next weekend. Yeah, so

608
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,920
Unfortunately, no Sony no Square Enix

609
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:29,160
This is starting to affect GDC as well where oculus will no longer be doing GDC and so on and so on

610
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,200
But you know when it comes to VR people are putting on those headsets

611
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,760
So I could see where maybe I mean even though they always wipe it if you ever see a VR booth anywhere

612
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,600
There is always right next to the giant device that goes on your head

613
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:48,920
There's an equally giant box of wet wipes to sanitize and wipe those things down between every single person that plays them

614
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,960
so I mean they already take precautions why because

615
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,560
They're still always just

616
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:02,520
Because it's a con in people are disgusting or using coronavirus in an unironic term

617
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,080
There's always sickness like con plague and all that stuff. I've got the corona virus

618
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,280
I'm drinking Corona and I'm full of germs. So anyway, um, just don't get me started

619
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:12,840
Yeah

620
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,760
so anyway

621
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,640
and then Bobby Blackwell says the Boston mayor has formally asked Sony to

622
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,600
Reconsider and that's an excellent point too is that this is economy, you know, these big shows are big economy for all this

623
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,840
This is very very interesting. I'm just I'm surprised

624
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:32,160
They're not at least even if they're holding back the staff for whatever reason they don't want to go fine at least

625
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:40,400
hire the local folks to put on the staff the booth fly some of the folks from San Francisco and still have a

626
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:46,440
Reduced presence even other like things like if they really wanted like people to answer questions and stuff

627
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,280
I mean like I know like trade shows that our company participates in they'll even do

628
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,660
Teleconferencing for certain individuals to answer questions and have one-on-one interactions that way

629
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,440
But I guess that's investment in effort that they don't want to make and DJ

630
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:09,480
Rama S says forget coronavirus learned a freakin shower bonds double-oh-six says I see people walking out of the restroom every damn day

631
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,680
You know what? You're absolutely right. Like I'm sorry. I don't mean to be crude today. I thought today

632
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,840
We're gonna we're gonna talk about this right now because when it comes to conventions like packs and stuff

633
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:24,840
It's not fucking kovat you should be worried about it's people who wipe their butt and then don't wash their hands or better yet

634
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,840
Okay, like fucking we need to have an education on that and dudes you've all seen it

635
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:34,480
I know you have you have seen that guy didn't that guy just come out of the stall did they not stuff?

636
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,800
Oh my god or better. Yeah, I never run into that in the women's bathroom

637
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:43,200
Just saying well better yet. We have toilets with goddamn motion sensors to flush them

638
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,920
You literally have to not touch them at all and you're not flushing the fucking toilet. You're leaving your shit

639
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,040
that is ridiculous, like

640
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,480
Move your hand in the general direction of the toilet and it will flush on its own

641
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:04,960
Like how hard is it or there's a relatively inoffensive button that you can push that will override and do it, you know

642
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,840
well, you're gonna wash your hands anyways, or maybe I guess you're not washing your hands, but just like

643
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,240
Triggered the fucking thing. So my point is

644
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,880
Sony should be more worried about

645
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,920
Funk boys who don't wash their hands after wiping their butt. He should be kovat 19

646
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:26,600
I'm sorry to be crude, but I'm fucking honest. I'm on it. You all know it. You know it you've seen it dudes

647
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,600
You know it firsthand

648
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,960
Pod culture in chat says orange lounge flush. Oh, so anyway

649
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,280
I

650
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,720
Agree, there are things that we might need to be a little more worried about and if you know

651
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,580
What if the World Health Organization were to come in and say maybe don't do packs

652
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,240
Then I would completely change my tone with all of this if the government says it

653
00:48:54,360 --> 00:49:00,160
Steps in and says maybe you shouldn't then fine. You know what out of whatever caution then we're not gonna do it

654
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,960
But they haven't come in and said that yet

655
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm missing the next two weeks of live. Oh, well are because I'm going on a cruise. I yes

656
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,080
I'm going on a cruise ship, and we know those are all the rage in the news right now

657
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:16,920
But you know what that's one ship out of what probably a thousand, and that's just ones that are based

658
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,800
So it's just hypothetically speaking here. Do they have a certain point which?

659
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,840
They don't get their deposit back on the booth space

660
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:31,240
And maybe there's a clause that says some sort of like health issue that they can back out of it because of

661
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,200
I

662
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,880
Maybe it's a little tinfoil hatty, but it could be

663
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,040
So yeah anyway

664
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:43,800
S 200 Matt says Italy is canceling a lot of public events including a ton of soccer matches

665
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,520
Then if that's what the government feels like they have to do then so be it

666
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:51,640
But I'm still going on that cruise, and you know what I I ain't afraid of no coronavirus

667
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,580
So I already just had strep

668
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,700
Among nameless other things I mean whatever anyway

669
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,900
I just hope the celebrities don't start pulling out

670
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,540
I mean I'm not huge on celebrity culture

671
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,540
So it's like whatever if they if they but I'll be very sad if all of a sudden next week

672
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,680
It's like all the celebrities who were gonna go on the cruise decided not to anymore

673
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,780
That'd be sad anyway

674
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:24,500
Bobby black wolf says they pulled out of GDC a day after you could get refunds on your hotels

675
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:29,260
So a lot of devs that were in the Sony and oculus boosts are left footing the bill

676
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:36,840
With nowhere to show their game and no ticket into GDC as all the exhibitor badges were pulled. That's a yikes Wow

677
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:43,940
That reminds me of a different packed story doesn't it Bobby black wolf doesn't it we won't get into that here

678
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,680
Let's see s to 100 Matt says all I have to say is that if I spent money to fly to Boston

679
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,580
Fought to get a hotel room used vacation days for certain companies to not show up

680
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,580
I would be pissed. Yeah, I mean, it's

681
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,340
Where do you draw there? There is a fine line between?

682
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,100
abundance of caution and

683
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:06,240
Too much caution and this probably for paranoia paranoia. That's a good word for it, too

684
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,100
And racism just saying well and well and some of this stuff with code

685
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,080
I didn't even realize some of this stuff was going on until I heard like

686
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:20,040
Chinatown is being less frequented in some places and people are like not going to Chinese restaurants

687
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,520
That is the most ridiculous racism, it's the most ridiculous fucking thing

688
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,400
I've heard in my entire life like honestly like please people please more people die of the flu

689
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,080
annually

690
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,440
Then are dying from this or car crashes, honestly

691
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:40,800
Like probably have better chances of being killed by a cow there. There is more chance of me

692
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:48,720
Getting in a Titanic type of situation on the cruise than there is of the kovat situation happening on that cruise. So

693
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,320
There you go anyway

694
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:58,120
Let's move on and I want to talk about angry world life weird world real-world diseases and things like that

695
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,800
Let's talk about other types of PlayStation look at all of the things that Playstations backing out of now including

696
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,720
I I kind of don't think this one is as big a deal

697
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,880
But are they afraid of the e-corona virus now?

698
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,380
So they're closing there

699
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:11,880
Okay

700
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,440
Look, so Sony if you didn't know has run their own official message boards

701
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,540
And this is a place where you can post and talk about games

702
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,920
You can troubleshoot ask for help and you can get into internet arguments with strangers

703
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,760
Isn't that what it's all about but no longer as of February 27th

704
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:38,000
They announced over at PlayStation comm beginning 27th of February the PlayStation comm forums will no longer be available

705
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:44,440
We invite you to continue the conversation via PlayStation blog Twitter Facebook and Instagram for product support

706
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,640
Please visit the support site PlayStation comm slash help and you know what Loki this is why I'm like

707
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:55,360
This really isn't that big a deal because welcome. Welcome to when vog network pulled the forums in 2017

708
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:02,520
Because when nobody was using them we were inundated by spammers and we found that people just prefer

709
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:08,280
Discord or they just prefer other ways of talking so on this one. I'm gonna give Sony a pass

710
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,360
forums

711
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:15,320
Forums have been a great thing in the past forums were a great piece of internet history

712
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:20,720
But I think most people in general have just moved on and forums of that sort are just no longer necessary

713
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:27,680
Know which forum I would like to engage in the PlayStation home. It needs to come back

714
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,040
Yeah, I would like to see but I will give up the forums for PlayStation home

715
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,040
But I'm not gonna hold my breath on that

716
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,560
so

717
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,640
Anyway, um, let's move on to another story dark Sakura

718
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:44,160
Well, this could be seen as just a massive, you know

719
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:53,600
But the IRS has confirmed that well of all the things that can be considered currency

720
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,940
video game in game currency is not

721
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:05,920
They confirmed that currencies collected within video games are not subject to the same tax obligation as cryptocurrency assets

722
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,280
So they're basically telling that people in games that use in-game currency

723
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:17,700
You can't claim this on your damn taxes stop just just stop, you know

724
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:26,760
Even though it is considered a virtual currency kind of like how cryptocurrency is it doesn't it's part of a video game

725
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,760
It doesn't count

726
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,280
They are listing that things like Bitcoin and ether

727
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,200
Are

728
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:43,160
Because I guess they're being used differently than only to one strict ecosystem that is being traded

729
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,680
As you know fully functioning currency that I mean

730
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,520
It's not the same thing

731
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,480
and in fact

732
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:58,860
It was I'm just gonna go give a statement from B in crypto

733
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:04,340
I'll just read this the taxation treatment of digital assets causes potential issues for cryptocurrency

734
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,940
Users you should they make a purchase using Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency

735
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:12,860
They must report any appreciation or devaluation of the digital currency at a time of purchase

736
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:18,380
Doesn't work like that for in-game currency. I mean, maybe if you're playing the auction house on Wow

737
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,900
No, not really. It doesn't count

738
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,420
Sorry

739
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:28,300
Go put your roblox or whatever they're called roebucks for roblox or whatever

740
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:34,980
so this really sounds like a thing where for whatever reason the IRS had to clarify this for people who can't tell the difference between

741
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:41,020
Bitcoin and gold in World of Warcraft like you say there, you know where you actually have, you know

742
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:46,860
A virtual currency that is meant to replace currency. It's used to settle legal debts and things like that

743
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:52,740
Whereas, you know, you can't really settle legal debts with Warcraft gold. I mean, I guess you could but

744
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:57,620
I think most reasonable people would understand that's not an actual thing that people do

745
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:02,380
Oh and one of the things is that they had something that made it sound like video game currency could be included

746
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:06,980
But they changed that off of the website very quickly and the quote from the IRS

747
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:11,140
The IRS recognizes the language on our page potentially cause concern for some taxpayers

748
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:16,580
Transacting in a virtual in virtual currencies as part of a game that do not leave the game environment

749
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:22,980
Virtual currencies that are not convertible would not require a taxpayer to indicate this on their tax return end of story

750
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,700
Yeah, and Bobby's pointing out and I think kind of coupling with what you just said

751
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:32,380
The IRS literally did list roblox and v-bucks on their tax forms. That's why people were worried

752
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:35,540
I mean, this is also about the government not understanding it Nick Lee

753
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:43,180
They could convert the roblox into money because because that's how it works on that service is you basically create

754
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:52,020
Content and people you can charge premium stuff for that content and the people pay with the roblox and then you then get paid

755
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,020
in real money

756
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:59,660
No, let's not teach kids this yeah, it's it's it's a little bit of a stretch

757
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:02,860
I mean I get it but yeah, it's a little bit of a stretch. So

758
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,380
Alright, let's let's move on to our next story Loki. So

759
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:11,660
Nvidia had has their brand new streaming service

760
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:17,460
Which is a little bit different than what stadia is offering right now or even I guess Xbox is kind of similar

761
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:22,420
So what they're doing with their service is unlike stadia where you have to buy

762
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:28,500
Games within their service and only used with that service. This actually links up with your

763
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:36,040
Accounts other places like steam epic and whatnot and then you can use the games the app purchase there to

764
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:40,780
Stream over that service to your devices and then of course you pay a $4.99

765
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,960
I think a month fee to have like unlimited access to that

766
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,260
however

767
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,260
Being the greedy fucks that they are

768
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,700
Activision has decided that they're gonna pull their games out of

769
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,420
the service beat due to a

770
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,860
Misunderstanding of

771
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,820
with the developer

772
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,820
I'm sorry with

773
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,360
Nvidia they said that they only agreed to be in the

774
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,340
beta test of the service but now

775
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:15,340
It comes down to that. You know that $4.99 fee that they're paying to basically

776
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:22,380
Run those games through not Activision servers, but in videos and really it's games

777
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:27,700
You've already purchased from those companies, but because the greedy fucks they want more money

778
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:32,040
They want they want some of that $4.99 to have their games on the service

779
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,960
And Bethesda did the same shit

780
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,780
So I don't know if I'm so quick to say that

781
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:45,360
Activision and Bethesda are the bad greedy company as you are. I mean I do

782
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,440
Understand just on a very superficial level

783
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:55,160
Essentially Nvidia is charging money for this product that is using somebody else's games and like I get it

784
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,160
they're games you've already purchased and so forth, but

785
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,120
Legally, and again, I'm just gonna you know, strictly kind of speak from that standpoint

786
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,200
Not like what's the nice thing to do but like the legal, you know

787
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,680
Usually in those end-user license agreements and so forth that you you scroll through and you don't really read when you agree to them

788
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,480
You know kind of like the redistribution of the product which is essentially what that is is

789
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:19,200
Forboding and like look I yeah, I get it Loki like it's it's the nice thing to do

790
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,800
It's the customer friendly thing to do and so forth

791
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:26,860
But I can also understand where Activision maybe wants like a little cut of that $5 a month

792
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:30,800
and I think they should get none of that fucking cut is what I think because

793
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,440
if you think about it

794
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:37,000
if anything this service is actually providing them more sales on their games because if

795
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,840
If for example, I don't have a PC they can run Call of Duty or some shit like that

796
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,320
But say I have a Google Chrome

797
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,560
You know the Chromebook or something like that and I decide hey, you know, I'm gonna load steam on there

798
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,560
I'm gonna purchase these games

799
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:58,280
legitimately and maybe some of the DLC or whatever and now I can stream it to that device and it's gonna have the fucking nice ray

800
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,280
tracing and shit on there because

801
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:06,440
That's what this whole service is about. It's all the RTX stuff on there. So now my shitty ass Chromebook can

802
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:14,600
You know stream Call of Duty and really fancy graphics and stuff like that that sounds like a really promising prospect for

803
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:22,280
You know that company to be able to sell the games to more folks that would be able to play them on platforms that might

804
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,520
Not normally support it

805
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,840
But of course, they're greedy fucks and can only see the short-sighted part of it and they're like, well we want more money

806
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:34,440
I actually that so here's a comment from our chat and I actually think this is on the money and I think this is that

807
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,360
In between the greedy and and what's really happening

808
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:42,200
So as to under Matt and chat says when a media company starts just scrolled off the screen

809
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,800
Sorry, when a media company starts pulling out of services

810
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:50,520
It tells me that that company wants to start their own service see NBC Disney, etc

811
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:54,080
I can see Bethesda starting their own service. Oh it is

812
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,000
That's what it is

813
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:04,720
It'll be broken as fuck Activision wants to charge five bucks a month for their own cuz but doesn't Bethesda have their own launcher

814
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,240
Activision has the battle net launcher and so forth

815
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,360
They want I mean if they're gonna go cloud gaming or whatever they want it

816
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:16,240
They want to charge the five bucks for their service. It's it's exactly where

817
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,680
Hollywood is

818
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,400
Model, it's the Netflix. It's what it's not a friends isn't on Netflix

819
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:29,200
Exactly the Netflix model because Netflix is different in the sense that for example just saying that everyone did off of Netflix

820
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,200
No, I understand with that

821
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:37,760
But with Netflix, of course, you know, I don't need to own all of the seasons of friends in order to watch it on Netflix

822
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:44,160
I just watch it on Netflix and then of course they get paid for having that content on the service because I

823
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:51,480
Don't own it but Netflix is licensing it for that. This is not licensing a game. This is streaming content that you own

824
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,320
That's not what I was talking about at all

825
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:58,960
I just mean like everyone's biting off of the game launcher model the way other companies built off of no

826
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,440
I understand everybody wants their own service because the greedy fucks so I get that

827
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:10,640
So but Bethesda, do you really want a streaming service from Bethesda Bethesda that fucking put out fallout 76?

828
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:15,360
Do you really want that you'd be lucky if your fucking PC doesn't melt from that shit?

829
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,200
No Activision Blizzard

830
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,320
maybe they

831
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:26,560
Here's the interesting thing is that when it comes to okay when we do talk about what's happening with the Netflix and it's getting splintered

832
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:31,960
So it's Disney Plus at CBS all access. It's peacock. It's Hulu. It's all this stuff, right?

833
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:38,120
What's happening? Is that piracy is coming back, you know, because people are like, I'm not gonna pay for like 11 different streaming services

834
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:38,780
Fuck it

835
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:42,240
I'm just gonna download it because this has gotten too difficult and too many people want my money

836
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,640
But the interesting thing is when it comes to like the game streaming and so forth

837
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:51,280
You can't really pirate that no you can't I mean you can borrow accounts or something like that

838
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,680
But I mean that's not really that's not really the issue here

839
01:02:54,680 --> 01:03:00,360
If anything, it's just gonna dissuade people from buying your games, which okay. I mean, I

840
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:07,300
Thought Bethesda was doing a good enough job at dissuading people from buying their games already, but other reasons

841
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,320
I

842
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,240
Don't get it, whatever

843
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,840
I'm sure that agreements will be worked out if they're going to and if not they say they have

844
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,200
1,500 more games coming to the service so fuck you guys if you really don't want your game on the service then

845
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,480
When I can't play Call of Duty or fallout 76. Yeah

846
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:29,240
well, I guess one of those games that they said is coming to the service right is

847
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,060
Cyberpunk because those developers aren't assholes. So

848
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:38,480
Cyberpunk 2077 will be available on GeForce now day one

849
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,000
so

850
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
cool

851
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,000
Interesting it is interesting though

852
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,860
I would be kind of willing to check this out because my PC while it's decent before streaming stuff

853
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,560
Or for playing games. I would be nice to see like

854
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,560
You know some of the stuff with RTX on so how I'd play Minecraft

855
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,880
RTX on just to see what that's like a little bit

856
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,260
I don't know

857
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:08,640
I guess the one thing I can't say about this whole mess is you know at least this is one of those things where I

858
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,360
Feel like this cloud streaming and this, you know cloud gaming and all that

859
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,520
This industry is still trying to kind of figure itself out in a way

860
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,820
So it's not like these games are going to be disappearing or these games can't be purchased the traditional way

861
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:23,660
You've always been getting them and playing them. This is more about

862
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:28,280
Trying to shape what that future looks like and everybody kind of wants a piece of that pie

863
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:34,880
So, I mean there is that is that it's not like you're really losing anything that kind of doesn't exist. You know, I mean, yes

864
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:41,120
Most people aren't streaming their games, you know and like things like Google stadia haven't exactly

865
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,160
Taken off yet, you know

866
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:48,960
And that's the thing is I like this business model over stadia because at least with this I know if I'm purchasing a game from

867
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:54,160
Steam that seems probably not going away anytime soon. Whereas Google stadia. I

868
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,720
Mean, I'm not too confident in

869
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,000
Anything from them

870
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Like I would not be surprised in the least if they shut that shit down in a couple in a year or so

871
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,200
But like at least with home last

872
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,840
Yeah

873
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,360
Hangouts

874
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,880
Not long enough. I still I technically I still use hangouts

875
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:21,120
But you can't like you can't do the on-air stuff anymore and it's and that's sad because that was a great great thing for podcast

876
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,760
Like I mean I would prefer

877
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,560
Purchasing stuff through like epic or I think even this maybe supports Google games as well

878
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,680
I mean, obviously if they're gonna be supporting

879
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,920
cyber about cyberpunk

880
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:39,380
So I would rather purchase through these sites and have that library because at the very least hey

881
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:46,460
Maybe I also own a PC and this is just mainly for like if I'm traveling or I want to play it on my phone

882
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:53,660
For god knows what reason, you know, I'd like having those options available where stadia you're locked into their ecosystem

883
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:58,900
And really I mean hell discounts alone already

884
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,740
This sounds like a better prospect

885
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:06,940
Anyways with steam and epic in there versus oh, you can only purchase through stadia that shit gonna be full price. So

886
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,220
I'll take this over stadia any day. I

887
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,260
I

888
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,020
Still think everything

889
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:19,580
Remains to be seen so we'll see. Yeah, that's that's kind of the interesting thing about this

890
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:23,220
There's still so much to see and to develop with the cloud gaming thing

891
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:29,580
So very very curious to see where this goes, especially once Microsoft really goes all-in on this

892
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:32,060
I think that is a huge key player in cloud gaming

893
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:39,580
It's really gonna disrupt everything going on here because Microsoft also has that backbone of Windows, you know to kind of invoke

894
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:43,700
So we'll see. We'll see what happens. Anyway for now. See they're like they're invoking the beast

895
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:48,900
You know when you got when you got something that's on every one not every computer

896
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:54,240
But a large amount of computers that are out there, you know, it's it's a pretty big thing to be waving around

897
01:06:54,940 --> 01:07:01,020
After all, I mean how many people have played solitaire or minesweeper because it was on every Windows computer, you know

898
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:03,380
Or if you want to go back to a minesweeper on my Mac

899
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:06,300
Well, but or if you want I was just about to say if you want to go back to

900
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:09,620
What was the game that used to be on every Mac that we would play

901
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:16,900
Crystal Crystal Quest or whatever there was like actually they just removed it for Mojave

902
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:20,720
But there used to be the Emacs commands back in the day where you could play Tetris

903
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:25,040
No, and you could play like the psychiatrist game and snake

904
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:31,360
I'm thinking like way back to like in when when your computers were all apples in the education

905
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,560
You know when you were in high school and stuff, I feel like there were games pre-installed on that too

906
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:40,880
But anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about let's talk about a modern game that everybody's gonna be playing

907
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,980
I think at least everybody in this studio. I don't know about low-key, but maybe I think so

908
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,340
And there don't be no cloud gaming on this one

909
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,520
It's Animal Crossing New Horizons

910
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:59,400
Finally the dedicated Nintendo Direct happened this past week because a lot of people were thinking like when's that gonna happen?

911
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,240
What are we gonna get you know all the details you actually cry, right?

912
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:07,760
I just might have cried. I read the bullet points basically, but you actually watch the whole thing, right? I

913
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:15,440
Did and every Animal Crossing community I'm in keeps finding stuff in it, too. It was pretty good. I'm pretty happy

914
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,880
I like how they laid it out kind of kept it in their universe, too. You know

915
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,880
There are definitely some familiar faces that are gone and one thing that people pointed out

916
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,960
Fairly readily is there's a grave

917
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
There is a gravestone

918
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,960
And we're trying to decide if it's toward Amur or Joan. Oh

919
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:41,160
Like they actually killed off a character. Yeah, I think it's toward Amur cuz he was really freaking old

920
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:48,000
But a lot of the like the event NPCs have been replaced. I heard her said he has a new job

921
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:56,600
At least he's there, you know, he's a honey dipper now, no, apparently he flies he's a helicopter

922
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:01,480
He's your rescue. He rescues you and you get stuck when you get lost if you get lost on the island

923
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:06,220
He'll come rescue you for some of your nook miles. I don't think it's that big of an island though

924
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:12,240
but they did talk more about the way the nook miles are gonna work that you use them to buy tickets to buy things or

925
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:18,280
You save them up for other things. I think you are also gonna be using my Nintendo Awards, but don't quote me on that

926
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,920
But a lot of the NPCs have been replaced like Jones niece or daughter granddaughter

927
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,840
Something is now the turnip lady and there is this bug girl

928
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,280
Which I am actually gonna go on record saying that I will forever

929
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:35,220
Think that this girl is non-binary or this creature is a non-binary and I will always refer to them as they

930
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:42,160
And there's also like a new one replacing chip, you know for the fishing tourney and all of that

931
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,160
This one's the one it does bug off

932
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:53,040
Isabel is going to be like your island manager you can unlock I guess her later on as you build more island

933
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:57,800
But as you are on the island and save up and cultivate, you know

934
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,120
Your environment on the island that and you start off with three villagers

935
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:08,200
But as that keeps going you're gonna be able to actually get your loan and build your house and build extensions on your house

936
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:15,700
You can have other people live on your island, but it is one island per switch

937
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,700
I will not be getting a

938
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,980
Switch light for the record because I wouldn't be able to play on my TV, right?

939
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:28,380
Um, they're they're just a bunch I got some of the you hit on a lot of the key points

940
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:29,940
Let me hit on a couple other things

941
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:33,420
This time you're gonna be able to select if you want to be in the northern or southern hemisphere

942
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:40,820
Which is great for the gamers that actually like are in the southern hemisphere can actually have seasons that match where they live and choosing

943
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,060
your island layout

944
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,420
Hmm and choosing your oh, yeah, you have to choose what type of island that you want

945
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:48,220
different seasons have different activities like

946
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:49,860
Seeds

947
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:54,420
You get a tent to start and you kind of talked a little bit about that and then you get the loan for the house

948
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:55,660
And all that stuff

949
01:10:55,660 --> 01:11:00,780
Resident services is open 24 hours where you get goods and you can sell your unwanted items

950
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:07,300
No longer will we have to wait until they're open our guards are coming back since dodo Airlines is doing the the village communication

951
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,260
Yeah, as I say the airport is now so it's not a gate

952
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:14,800
It's an airport and that's what allows you to either invite other players to the island or go to other islands

953
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:19,880
Eight people on the island at once so I think that's up from four if I remember you can invite your animals over

954
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,920
But you can also report a villager that you don't like of course

955
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:29,800
The nook phone is something that has apps like a camera and you get to use that to kind of attract your nook miles

956
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,120
Yeah, and then mr

957
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:38,400
Nook will give a special broadcast at the beginning of each day with possible daily activities and other helpful information

958
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:44,360
That's very ominous makes me think of though. It makes me think of how they do. I'm gonna mispronounce this

959
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:50,520
Radio extra law. I'm not gonna even bother Japanese the radio exercises where they do like a morning news announcement

960
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:55,240
And then they have the early morning exercises. That's what that makes me think of and during mr

961
01:11:55,240 --> 01:12:02,580
Nook special broadcast the images of the animals who deceased the day prior will be broadcast into the sky while the cannons are fired

962
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,980
Right one of the say that but I would love that game

963
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,680
I'm happy about nook link

964
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:19,520
So that I can use some of the happy home designer stuff and you know online designs or QR codes things like that

965
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,520
That one's really cool

966
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:27,100
There was but then there's all this stuff that you don't that we saw in the direct

967
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:33,680
That Nintendo is not talking about but we saw this shit and there's other videos on their website

968
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,360
Like I mentioned the grave

969
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:42,960
Shiny dig spots are back. That is a big deal shiny dig spots our pitfall still in the game where I can push my

970
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,160
every one though

971
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,560
I mean as long as I have a place to torture Barbara, then I'm fine

972
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,940
I just know she's gonna be one of the three that shows

973
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,440
Invite Ed just so I can beat him up and kick him out

974
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,000
All right

975
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,040
I want Deena though because Deena is gonna be my gym teacher

976
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,120
I would love if they've evolved it so that if you start hitting

977
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:09,600
Animals with bug nets over and over they start hitting you back. This is the thing you can faint

978
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,560
from being

979
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,880
Stung by wasps or bees

980
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,600
Or die. I don't know

981
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:21,120
I think it's more like you'll be fainting and then wake up at home or something dragged into Tom Nook's

982
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,740
Yeah, I say do you wake up in the middle of Tom Nook's sex dungeon where he's?

983
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:31,520
Some of us are not into that. Hello. I didn't say I was into it. No one's into that

984
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:38,880
You but you can buy your DIY recipes, you know, you can earn your bells. You have the recycle bin you have trash

985
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,320
That's me. I mean that's Barbara

986
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,760
But you gather seeds you will have seasonal

987
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:53,000
Like mushrooms in certain parts of the season. You'll have like other things growing at different times of the year

988
01:13:53,040 --> 01:14:00,080
So it sounds like the folio just gonna be moving with the seasons. Although I think that the the fruits and vegetable vegetables

989
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,080
The fruits are still year-round

990
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,280
and stonks

991
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:11,760
Sorry stocks turnip stonks. So needless to say you are very excited about Animal Crossing and there's less than a month to go

992
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,800
No shit excited about it

993
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:21,160
But I would just say that there's a couple of Animal Crossing groups on the Facebook's if you're so inclined

994
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,820
Just look for Animal Crossing over 25

995
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,920
people are

996
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:31,740
Losing their shit and posting every little thing. Okay, this is what I'm kind of excited about this dumb thing

997
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:34,780
Okay, the animals actually wear full clothes

998
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:39,980
I mean like not pants, you know, but like they'll wear dresses or long sleeves and

999
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:47,940
The the sheep don't wear scarves they wear clothes and I'm here for it. Okay, interesting

1000
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:54,380
Stonks Rob. All right. Well, I can't wait to come visit your island and write all your villagers nasty notes

1001
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:57,940
I did invite Brie Larson to my island just saying well, I hope she visits. All right

1002
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,140
Bobby black wolf is pointing out

1003
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:05,820
One of my favorite things is all the memes about how Animal Crossing and doom eternal are coming out on the same day

1004
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:07,380
And they're all so wholesome

1005
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:08,380
I agree

1006
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:14,820
Have you seen like I've seen when Nintendo posted that there was an Animal Crossing direct scheduled the official doom account replied

1007
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:21,740
Will Isabel be there because there's all those memes about doom guy and Isabel or like BFFs. Well, and there's also

1008
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:30,740
Apparently a lot of the Animal Crossing groups that I'm in got their screenshots with Isabel or nook talking before the words fill in

1009
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:32,740
The bubble. Oh, hello. That's my hand

1010
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,000
And I've already started, you know

1011
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,720
Making up their own

1012
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:42,600
Memes about like them saying stuff because you can get the animal cries called like hummingbird is that is the font?

1013
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:49,540
But people are doing their own memes about it already with like hi, I'm Isabel. Welcome to jackass or something

1014
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:53,580
You know, so it's just it's pretty it's pretty funny stuff

1015
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:54,500
All right

1016
01:15:54,500 --> 01:16:00,980
There is by the way Animal Crossing meme fill is another group that I'm in it is it is gold

1017
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:07,580
It is absolute gold. All right. Well, let's move on or else we'll fall down a hole of dank memes and never recover

1018
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:14,820
So let's go to actually dark soccer. You have the next story Rob one last word Oh stonks. Okay. Yes. Thank you. Okay

1019
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,340
Anyway, this is absolutely disgusting

1020
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:20,100
So

1021
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,900
Literally as she said that her purse fell over like it was

1022
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:33,600
So the army is ahead of its recruiting schedule because of video games

1023
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:40,340
they are basically adapting to Gen Z by putting virtual recruiting stations and

1024
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,180
advertising in eSports arenas

1025
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:49,900
And because they're pretty much all over the place they're just getting people left and right they had they hit their goal of

1026
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:52,100
68,000 troops in 2019

1027
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:55,620
It's just the the thing is

1028
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:00,500
They

1029
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:03,580
They had fallen short years before and it's because of this

1030
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:11,020
Restructuring, you know, they did add, you know, they did ads during NFL games before where the average age is

1031
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:15,700
55 which doesn't exactly call in those poor

1032
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:18,460
desperate to pay for college or

1033
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:25,380
Highly patriotic people I guess or people, you know who are young enough to fit their demographic and I

1034
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:33,860
I love two minds about this because there are people who legitimately join because they feel it's their duty

1035
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:39,200
They want to and then there's some people who that is their only escape from a situation that they're in

1036
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,200
I've known plenty of people like that

1037
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,880
I

1038
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:49,960
There's a lot of people who get some great like on-the-job training experience. Like it's a it's a great like

1039
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,600
training

1040
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:58,720
Education learning type of thing for many people but what does what disgusts me is this is not the administration that I want to see

1041
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
these kids going in into

1042
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:08,520
Servicing. Well, what's interesting is that I think we I want to say there was a story about how in general like recruitment was down

1043
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,340
especially when you know

1044
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:16,260
The this current administration was very anti trans and many of their policies and there's a lot of us that know trans people that are

1045
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:19,320
Like this is fucked up. I don't want to support a system that does this

1046
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:24,580
So I think a lot of people kind of have to kind of weigh all these factors in their minds where it's like well

1047
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:29,280
Maybe I'm do I'm not doing it for the the guy in the White House

1048
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:35,320
I'm doing it for me and I'm doing it for my community and protecting my people and so I I get that

1049
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:40,880
Here's what else is disgusting me is a hundred and sixty million dollars. Is there advertising budget, right?

1050
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:47,920
What else could a hundred and sixty million dollars do how many people could that feed how many social services that are being?

1051
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:54,360
Dismantled by the administration could this money have gone into to help improve the lives of people who desperately could use that money and assistance

1052
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:58,640
Just saying well and swung tongue in our chat says why is this a news story?

1053
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:05,080
Well, I mean it is because video games have been part of and maybe talking about how something

1054
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:12,800
Lowered by certain things. This is a way that they've gotten people interested in maybe educating people that there are options

1055
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,680
You know if maybe your family can't afford the college

1056
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,240
eSports specifically. Yeah, so

1057
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,660
I

1058
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:29,120
Don't have a problem with people serving. Of course if it is their true hearts desire

1059
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:34,080
I'm happy for people, you know, I'm thankful for people who have served we've need needed people

1060
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,040
Family of mine. I come from a long line of

1061
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:43,180
Army people my sister was Navy. My brother was a marine, you know

1062
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,320
But at the same time I just think that it's that specific

1063
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,740
targeting and the combination of the current administration

1064
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:57,920
That I don't think this is the well and also how poorly our veterans are being treated right now. I

1065
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:04,600
Want that hundred and sixty million dollars that's being used to advertise to kids and I want it to pay for our veterans benefits

1066
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,160
end of the story

1067
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:12,360
Did your MS does want to point out and clarify just because you serve that does not mean you'll be in the front lines

1068
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,640
No, well, this is true. My brother was in supply battalion

1069
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:20,400
Yeah, but he was with the first group that went over and they did see combat. Yeah, I'm just saying that

1070
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,820
Whether or not, you know, that's the case

1071
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:30,780
It is this administration right now that I do not want to see people have to give their lives for sure

1072
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:36,900
And I mean, you know it or potentially it makes people nervous when somebody's doing foreign policy by tweet, you know

1073
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:43,120
It's and I would much rather that that again that that money that's being spent on this advertising pay for our veterans

1074
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:47,100
By the way, do we mention that the primaries are coming up coming up in many states?

1075
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:50,860
So make sure you're registered to vote everybody. I got my I got my at-home ballot

1076
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:56,760
Yeah, so California is very easy to vote early. I was very happy about Nevada. Yeah, so, all right

1077
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:01,100
Yeah, and Phoenix 7726 says let me also be clear

1078
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:04,940
my anger is aimed at the government itself not the troops as people and I think many of us are

1079
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:10,580
very much in that same boat is that you know, the troops do amazing things and wonderful things and they they

1080
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:18,060
Do that, you know to support the rest of our rights to complain about the government essentially. So for that I'm thankful

1081
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:23,220
No, I I have a very good friend who served us for sergeant in

1082
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:26,520
She's doing it. No, she was in Texas at the time

1083
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,820
When she actually came through on a layover for her train layover I say but on train

1084
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:35,700
I got to hang out with her and her daughter at the the railroad station. No fun downtown

1085
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,940
It was pretty fun and had a very good discussion over things. I have no problem with

1086
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:47,540
People who want to serve any way that any means that they want to what I have the problem with is the tactics used

1087
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:48,860
to attract people

1088
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:49,740
All right

1089
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:55,820
Well, let's move on from the subject to a couple more stories here before we get to the classic game of the week Loki

1090
01:21:56,060 --> 01:22:04,180
yes, so Activision is not happy that their brand new game mode for Call of Duty has been leaked and so now they're

1091
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:06,180
trying to

1092
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:08,140
Basically

1093
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:12,000
subpoena reddit to uncover who the user is so that they can

1094
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:17,840
Go after them for leaking their information which from my understanding was based on

1095
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:25,240
They updated a brand new or the brand new update for season two of their content or whatever

1096
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:30,280
and so there's a way apparently to glitch into the game mode from the main menu and

1097
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:37,440
So they posted the video based on this and it's apparently a brand new battle royale mode for Call of Duty

1098
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,280
That's gonna have 200 players and whatnot. Oh boy

1099
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:42,440
Yep, so

1100
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:48,720
They're not happy. They're very mad that this user leaking their brand new game announcement

1101
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:54,120
So I don't and I feel like I don't often hear of them going after you know, the leakers

1102
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:58,220
I mean, I've known Nintendo we hear that a bunch but I feel like for a lot of companies

1103
01:22:58,220 --> 01:22:59,400
They've just kind of had to deal with it

1104
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:05,180
Like when Walmart Canada was spilling all those dates that one e3 like they just I mean, maybe it's because it's a corporation

1105
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:07,180
They just kind of had to deal with it, you know

1106
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:11,940
They didn't subpoena them or what have you so it's usually come after him

1107
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:17,900
Yeah, secrets are hard to keep sometimes when it's so easy to be anonymous on the internet. Yeah, so well

1108
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:24,000
Make an example out of somebody. Yep. Apparently they had like an image that was captured that showed

1109
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:26,780
call of duty warzone and

1110
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:33,660
The map and all that fun stuff little Bobby with an interesting point in our chat over at twitch TV slash vog network saying

1111
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:39,660
They'll go after the leakers if they obtain the information via hacking and that was something that happened when Nintendo not that long ago

1112
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:44,860
I remember but not for just taking a picture of something somewhere. Yeah, like if you know something

1113
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:50,100
Shows up in a warehouse somewhere early and somebody takes a picture of that. It's hard to go after that

1114
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:55,780
But if somebody like went into computers and hacked stuff, we know that happened when Nintendo story about that not that long ago

1115
01:23:56,620 --> 01:24:01,520
They will Nintendo will sue so to speak. Yeah, so kind of interesting well

1116
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:08,360
They'll do they'll try to figure out who it is no matter what the scenario is right. I know that from personal experience. Oh

1117
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:16,680
Yes, there was that. Oh, yes. I remember those days. So and so yes, they will try to come after you but

1118
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:25,560
Not always with a lawsuit. All right, well moving on let's talk a little bit about I wonder if Activision might go after this, too

1119
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:30,440
I don't know because this is a game that was supposed to come out a very very long time ago

1120
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:35,520
How old is this was this like 2002 when this game was was coming out was long at the early 2000s a while

1121
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,940
It was Starcraft ghost was the game and Starcraft ghost, you know

1122
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:41,180
It never ended up coming out even though it was shown at 1e3

1123
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:44,620
It was shown, you know, and so it almost looked like it was pretty close to done

1124
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:46,880
But for whatever reason they didn't finish it

1125
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:53,940
But now here we are in the year 2020 an early Xbox build has hit the internet and showed up online

1126
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:59,280
Apparently some screenshots showed up on Twitter, you know, and then they spread like wildfire

1127
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:03,520
Some Xbox groups had the screenshots posted anonymously

1128
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:09,880
I'm sure I'm sure the game is spreading like wildfire on the dark web or whatever you want to call it

1129
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:16,120
You know, you know how it is, you know when things come out. Yeah, but anyway, it's out there now

1130
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:20,480
That's what once it's on the internet is always on the internet. So it's out there if you if you want to go look for it

1131
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:24,040
There are some youtubes that are were up

1132
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:29,040
Although I think some of them have been taken taken down pretty quickly as fast as they go up

1133
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:33,440
But it's pretty hard to take something down once they're off the internet

1134
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:41,120
So you can check that. Yeah, there's a clip here for Starcraft goes 720p on Xbox and it's it's still there. So

1135
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,560
anyway

1136
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:49,680
So, I guess some folks on Twitter are actually posting links that is a build that people can download

1137
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:54,680
But it is from a dev kit and a screenshot of a dev kit. This is Starcraft ghost on it

1138
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:58,640
Not everything in it is like you can't just play it like a normal game

1139
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:04,360
Like I think you have to go all the way to like round three or something or state world three to actually play things

1140
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:09,320
Because the first two worlds are actually broken, but it is interesting what people are uncovering about this game

1141
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,320
That essentially was never finished

1142
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:17,100
So it's it's so interesting how the game was so close to being done, but never released

1143
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,840
but you know, it could end up being a thing like

1144
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:26,620
Earthbound zero or the original mother game on the NES they translated that stuff for the u.s

1145
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:29,300
But just never ended up releasing it until

1146
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:36,140
Years later they put that out on was it we virtual console or was it we you one of those they put the earth

1147
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:41,700
Earthbound zero that was we you and yeah, so because it was to try to get more people interested in we you

1148
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:45,160
So they actually put that out for people to download. So who knows?

1149
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:50,580
I mean, it's not to say Starcraft goes will never happen. But I mean, it's obviously gonna be very dated at this point

1150
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:56,380
So I I doubt much will happen with it, but they could it's still technically their intellectual property

1151
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:58,380
There is that so

1152
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:04,140
All right. Anyway, let's take a trip down memory lane. Shall we let's let's talk about games that were released

1153
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,260
Well in some parts anyway

1154
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:11,740
Anyway, it's the classic game of the week and every week dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks

1155
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:17,600
Hey you brats, you should be checking out this game. Forget your newfangled Starcraft ghost

1156
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,700
Go back a little further and check out this game

1157
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:25,780
And this is one this little little aptly timed with some of the things we've been talking about this week, I suppose

1158
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:32,020
So dark Sakura go in the gaming vault and tell us what game you're gonna highlight this week. Oh gosh, there are

1159
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:38,580
Well, hold on. The game is a weird one and it came up because of

1160
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:44,320
The movie so I'm gonna see it's Sega Sega Sonic the Hedgehog

1161
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:47,100
Yes, I said that right Sega Sonic the Hedgehog

1162
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:54,600
It is the it's an arcade game with Sonic the Hedgehog done by Sega, but not by Sonic team

1163
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:03,400
So basically it is an isometric game where you play as Sonic or

1164
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:07,220
Mighty the armadillo

1165
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:12,000
Armadillo, I can never say that. I don't want to go armadillo and ray the flying squirrel

1166
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:16,420
This is I think we're we got ray in another game since then

1167
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:20,340
But this was the first game that mighty was in next scene in Knuckles Chaotix

1168
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:22,140
You

1169
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:25,900
Use a trackball to move your characters and collect wings

1170
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,540
It was developed by am3

1171
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:33,020
And it was inspired by a marble madness

1172
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:37,300
It came out in Japanese arcades in 1993. It has never been re-released

1173
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:45,580
They've wanted to port it to the 32x and then it was cut out of the sonic compilation in the sonic gems collection in 2005

1174
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:50,380
Because they could not replicate the control system without having a trackball

1175
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:56,940
A lot of people thought it was kind of neat, but I don't know it's weird. I

1176
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:05,220
It is really hard to play if you don't have a trackball, but the game is kind of neat although, you know Sonic team

1177
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:10,060
You know, they they basically assisted with some of it

1178
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,500
but like

1179
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:16,420
Some of the like Yuji Naka doesn't really care for it that much

1180
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:24,580
And then the reason why it didn't come out in the u.s. Is that

1181
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:32,960
Sega well, first of all Sega of America didn't turn in their paperwork for the trademark in enough time. That was part of it

1182
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,480
And it was called Sega

1183
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:38,100
Sega Sonic

1184
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:39,340
because

1185
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:45,040
There was something about the sonic name Sega had lost the trademark for it for a brief moment when it came out

1186
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:47,260
The game does have voice acting in it

1187
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:54,460
Some some pretty, you know neat people in there. I mean, it's basically voice actors for Sonic ray mighty and Eggman

1188
01:29:55,780 --> 01:30:01,020
It used the Sega system 32 motherboards so you could have multiplayer. So three at a time

1189
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:04,180
and

1190
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:06,660
EGM gave this game a 10 out of 10 and

1191
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:11,620
Say it said that it shatters your perception of what a good game should be

1192
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:17,460
It was praised for graphics and levels and the graphics are great, you know, so that the character animations the cinematics were great

1193
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:19,560
and

1194
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:22,900
the French magazine mega force compared it to

1195
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,580
Zach's on and viewpoint

1196
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:31,200
Because of course they did but again, like I said as far as the legacy goes

1197
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:37,420
There were some people who didn't really care for it like game spy said it was really disappointing games radar

1198
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:46,520
One of their reviewers say that it had really bland level design and imprecise control and that it had some fuzziness to the graphics

1199
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,440
I personally not a fan of isometric games. So I

1200
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:55,060
Don't know that I would enjoy playing this that much. There's a lot that seems really frustrating like this bit right here

1201
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,380
It is interesting. Like I actually didn't really know about this game

1202
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:02,980
so this is like almost education for me too, but it is interesting in the way that like

1203
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:08,260
Sonic spin ball is kind of like a little twist on the Sonic franchise

1204
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:14,180
I don't know if I see the marbled madness in this really but because you are controlling it with a trackball on

1205
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:21,400
On isometric surfaces, I guess but it is an interesting kind of use of Sonic's mechanics in a different type of game

1206
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:23,200
But um lot many folks

1207
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,220
I don't know if you're gonna get to it

1208
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:28,660
But many folks in chatter kind of wondering like how can I play this or am I stuck really? Yeah

1209
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:30,700
Um, you can maim it but you'll need to have a trackball controller

1210
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:37,100
For this and you will not be able to do multiplayer without three three trackballs or two at least to do two player

1211
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:41,300
But again for other, you know things about this

1212
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:48,020
Like I said mighty I showed up next in knuckles Chaotix for the 32 X Ray did not appear in another game

1213
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:52,160
But he and mighty were in the Sun at the hedgehog comic book by Archie comics

1214
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:57,960
And then ray became a member of the Chaotix with mighty in in that series

1215
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:05,160
The game was referenced in Sonic Generations where there was a missing persons poster of ray and mighty in city escape

1216
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:12,200
And mighty and ray are playable in Sonic Mania Plus in 2018, which was the expanded version of Sonic Mania

1217
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,800
But yeah, that's it

1218
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:19,100
You know, I would say I know that there are

1219
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:24,340
People who have recreated it specifically I know that there are

1220
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:26,700
main setups

1221
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:28,380
Where you can?

1222
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:31,900
Do a trackball you've actually got like home arcade controllers

1223
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:36,580
I mean there's schematics out there where they'll have joystick and they'll have trackball set up

1224
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:44,140
But it's it's gonna require some doing because there is no supportive way to play this at home, you know, I

1225
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:47,400
Don't know if it would work with a dial controller

1226
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,400
But

1227
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:53,460
You'd have to and it wouldn't even be the same but you'd have to

1228
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,040
That's the way most people are gonna ultimately play it is using the

1229
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,720
Mouse, which is basically an inverted trackball

1230
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:02,320
But yeah

1231
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:09,280
And and it wouldn't still be the same deal sadly because of the mixed reception there really isn't a legal way to play this yet

1232
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:13,920
But hopefully you know what was Sonic the Hedgehog all the rage now because the movies done so well

1233
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,800
You never know what Sega might look at doing Sega loves to do their retro collections

1234
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:23,000
So tweet them tweet them that you want to see this game just just for the nostalgia of nothing else

1235
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:28,060
I just wonder how they'd still work out the control. I mean really that that would be it

1236
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:33,840
How would they work out the control and that's probably why we haven't seen this comes exactly why they?

1237
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,920
Yeah, they were gonna bring it out in 2005

1238
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:40,180
But they said that they couldn't get the control

1239
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,800
Squared away enough to make it viable

1240
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,620
Podculture says a sonic one-up cabinet I

1241
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:54,780
Guess or or something something at least I wish those arcade one-ups were a little more expandable and then something like something else that already

1242
01:33:54,780 --> 01:34:00,380
Uses a trackball like don't they have a centipede millipede you do so something we could like sideload this game

1243
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:06,560
I think this one would be way too much of a niche. Yeah, I know it's it's very nice

1244
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:10,240
But that's also why I kind of like that you highlighted it because you know

1245
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:12,080
Pretty nice

1246
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:17,000
I'm pretty sure you've highlighted the original Sonic and Sonic 2 and probably even Sonic Spinball before

1247
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:20,480
So it is kind of fun with Sonic being all the rage again because of the movie

1248
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:25,120
It's kind of spotlight a game that like oh you may not have even realized this Sonic game existed

1249
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:28,220
So pretty cool. Yeah, I mean and and

1250
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:35,340
Graphically it is really nice. It is really nice if I liked isometric games. I'd probably be all over this you know

1251
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:38,220
And I like that the challenges

1252
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:42,280
You've got things that force you to keep moving and traps to

1253
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:45,660
Spring and you have to really think you can't just got to go fast

1254
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:47,020
You know your way through it

1255
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:49,300
You know and that to me has a lot of the marble madness

1256
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:54,660
Factor in it right there because the marble madness you had to do a lot of trap avoidance and here is exactly the same thing

1257
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:59,140
All right, so there it is your classic game of the week Sega Sonic the Hedgehog

1258
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:04,260
Which was only released in arcades overseas and you're gonna be very very hard to find here

1259
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:05,340
but still a

1260
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:10,620
classic game for giving us a different look at Sonic the Hedgehog and doing something a little bit different with it than what you might

1261
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:13,560
Be used to so there it is good choice very very

1262
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:17,700
Niche pick, but the good type so because I didn't even figured it was time

1263
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:20,780
I didn't even realize I mean I may have heard of this game like a long time ago

1264
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:24,860
You've probably mentioned it to me at some point in passing, but my brain can only handle so much

1265
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:26,860
So it was kind of neat to revisit that with

1266
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:33,180
Everybody talking about the movie and stuff all right, so we're gonna move on with more of our program

1267
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:35,620
Are you are you staying for a little bit longer you heading out or what?

1268
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:38,740
I can but I don't think it'd be long enough to get to my portion, okay?

1269
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:44,660
So rapid-fire cuz we're gonna go rapid-fire right now. Yeah, I could do my stories. Okay. I have to reopen them

1270
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:50,100
We'll do rapid-fire, so why don't I'll have Loki start, and then we'll just go right to you, okay, so Loki

1271
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:51,340
What do you have in rapid-fire news tonight?

1272
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:56,740
So we can talk a little bit about some games that are coming out of early access so for example

1273
01:35:56,740 --> 01:36:01,660
We have besieged which it's taken five years, but it's finally released

1274
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:06,900
1.0 so that means that they very early access they finished the

1275
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:13,260
Single-player campaign and they've also introduced new blocks to the game as well that you can program

1276
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:17,760
Because one of the things that people like doing with the game is actually making like very complex machines

1277
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:19,860
So now you can do that a little bit easier

1278
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:21,100
But that is available now

1279
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:26,260
Which I own that game and have to go back to check it out and then something that's coming back

1280
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:29,220
Not the same

1281
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:36,560
Is Grand Theft Auto 4 which you may not have known actually disappeared off of many

1282
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:43,940
Game services because it was still using games for Windows Live and that was powering its multiplayer well

1283
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:46,460
now

1284
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:52,600
They're gonna be launching it across all storefronts including steam and rockstar zone game launcher

1285
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:55,540
without games for Windows Live

1286
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:58,420
But there's no multiplayer online

1287
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:02,060
Honestly, that was the best part about Grand Theft Auto 4

1288
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:09,820
So I don't endorse this I also don't endorse the fact that they're calling the complete collection because that's a bunch of complete bullshit

1289
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:12,380
since it's not complete, but

1290
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:20,240
Whatever. What am I gonna do pirate servers is what I'm gonna do because that's what I want pirate servers for Grand Theft Auto 4

1291
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:27,740
Whatever you know what you take out my music in the other games and even Grand Theft Auto 4 and then you

1292
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:30,180
Do this

1293
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:34,700
All right. Well if you I mean, I guess no one's playing it in games for Windows Live sucks ass

1294
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:38,940
But I can really want to revisit for without all that stuff

1295
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:43,900
You know, can I do that like the Xbox or like PlayStation true?

1296
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:50,500
Especially if backwards compatibility really is everywhere in this next generation as they say. Yeah. All right, Dar Sacher before you head out

1297
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:55,940
I know we want to cover your quick stories here. Yep. Um, so and this is just a little follow-up

1298
01:37:55,940 --> 01:38:03,620
I'm not gonna spend any more time on it. But there is a millionaire who bought the Nintendo PlayStation prototype for

1299
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:12,380
$360,000 apparently is the same guy whose company he sold his company to Facebook. So what? Oh, yeah

1300
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:14,620
It's yeah, I know that dude. Yeah

1301
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:17,420
Really then if you know him tell me give me some money

1302
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:25,700
Whomp Palmer lucky. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, and then also Animal Crossing New Horizons will get a guidebook

1303
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:29,660
I didn't realize that it was gonna be a US one too by future press

1304
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:36,100
I know that the Japanese one had already been announced and actually it looks like a lot of the design is the same same cover

1305
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:39,260
And all that so maybe they're just doing a translation of the Japanese guide

1306
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,660
but

1307
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:44,420
it's it's saying that it's a

1308
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:49,780
Gonna be 432 pages paperback coming out on

1309
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:52,860
April 9th 2020 for 30 bucks

1310
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:55,420
Hey, you know I got a birthday

1311
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:58,340
All right, and I'm done. All right

1312
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:03,180
Well, I know you're about to head out because some you've got work commitments very early in the morning

1313
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:05,580
Do you have any final thoughts or things for our listeners tonight? I

1314
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:12,660
Desperately wish I could have ice cream. It would make me sick as fuck, but I want some ice cream

1315
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:15,780
Just saying are you able to do yogurt or sorbet something halfway there?

1316
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:21,940
No, they all kind of hit me the same way, but ice cream is what I want and it's particularly bad

1317
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:23,980
I do have seized candy at home

1318
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:29,100
So that shit's going in my mouth. All right. Well, we'll see you on I'll see you on Wednesday

1319
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:34,460
And then we'll we'll for something that y'all will see on Sunday. What time what time are we doing on Wednesday?

1320
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:38,020
We never figured that out or at least I don't know six about six. Does that work for you?

1321
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:43,260
Okay, I mean I can get here by by five. Okay. Yeah, I don't usually get home till about 445

1322
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:45,260
So yeah, so six should be fine, right?

1323
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:47,780
fine or even

1324
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:53,700
535 30. All right by 15. All right. Sounds good deal deal done. I'll be home by 5

1325
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,660
So you guys can just show up whenever all right, I'll show up whenever then 7

1326
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,740
Bye everybody. Hi. All right

1327
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:06,720
Let's move on. I have a couple things for you guys, which includes no man's sky a new update

1328
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:12,520
Yeah, I was kind of giggling because as I'm doing my big huge no man's sky playthrough all of a sudden

1329
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:15,380
They're like big update and that's right a new update came out

1330
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:20,240
It was the living ship update that came out where you actually grow an organic spaceship

1331
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:25,420
So that is the newest update they did so it's not like a major one, but they do call it the living ship update

1332
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:31,660
So you hatch this ship and you use organs that dictate the abilities. It's kind of interesting

1333
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:36,940
It sounds like chocobo breeding and Final Fantasy 7 basically. No, it's horrible. I don't like that

1334
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:41,020
I'm oversimplifying things a bit, but it's that concept but with spaceships

1335
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:43,460
So instead of just buying and trading for ships

1336
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:48,620
So that's kind of I hope it's not as terrible as that or maybe I'm sure or is it or I?

1337
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:54,060
Can't remember which I hated more was it Final Fantasy 11 chocobo breeding or was it Final Fantasy 7?

1338
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:58,620
They're both bad. Yeah, they were all terrible and pharmacy 14 has it too. So anyway

1339
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:01,340
Can they just breathe themselves?

1340
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:05,560
Yeah, they can it just be as simple as like throwing food at them like in Minecraft, you know

1341
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:09,920
It's still just interesting to note that no man's sky is still doing these different updates

1342
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:12,840
It's kind of interesting by the way, and I didn't talk about it during my gaming week

1343
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:15,520
but it is very easy to find other people now because

1344
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:20,360
There's this central hub called the space anomaly and pretty early on in the story

1345
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:24,640
You get the ability to just summon it that it'll just show up in your galaxy and it's like a central hub

1346
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:25,220
Yeah, okay

1347
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:25,800
so

1348
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:31,360
And you go to the central hub and there's other players there and while the players are there you can teleport to any of their

1349
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:37,520
Galaxies where their bases are so the littles the star gates that you can build now have become huge in

1350
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:41,880
Traveling to other people in other places like really fast. That's cool. It's kind of interesting. I think it's really cool

1351
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:43,520
One one little shout out

1352
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:44,520
I wanted to give a no-man's sky

1353
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:50,800
But my other quick rapid-fire story is about the Witcher 3 with a new update that you now have cross saves

1354
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,920
Between PC and the switch that's right cross save

1355
01:41:54,660 --> 01:42:00,580
Wasn't that a thing that Konami did on the Vita back in the day transferring or something like that was what they call it

1356
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Yeah, so it's transferring

1357
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:05,320
But now with your switch and your piece

1358
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:11,560
I thought those Metal Gear but like I don't know it was some game some dungeon crawler that they were showing one year

1359
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:14,480
Yeah, it was it was on the Vita and it was on the PlayStation 3 I think so

1360
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:17,180
I'm I I'm reaching for the reference here

1361
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:22,200
But it made me think of that because like the cross save thing is is all about that. So anyway, I

1362
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,640
You can now

1363
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:27,020
Play so if you save a game on the PC

1364
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:30,700
You can kind of pick that up with steam and our steam and gog on the PC

1365
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:32,740
You can pick that up on the switch. So that's cool

1366
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:38,900
Mog related bugs and blockers could get transferred from a modded PC game save file

1367
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:43,860
So just be careful if you're using mods because obviously the switch doesn't really handle mods in the same way

1368
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:47,960
So that could screw things up. So that's it for my rapid-fire news

1369
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:54,620
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates starting in the u.s. Loki. All right, so, let's see in

Nobody knows on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox one romance of the three kingdoms

1388
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:20,840
Looks like it is 14 and that's on PC and PlayStation 4. That's it

1389
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:25,940
All right that I can't wait to try that Space Channel 5 game. So too bad

1390
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:29,220
I probably won't get around to that until I'm back in a couple weeks, but still sounds fun

1391
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:32,300
Let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases there

1392
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:38,380
So coming out in Japan on the switch this week the rock man zero and ZX double hero collection

1393
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:43,860
So this is another one of those main collections just Japanese getting their own release. I think I think they've already had it

1394
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:50,540
This is just like a repackaging of two of them together a game called lover kiss the are capitalized there that is out as well

Bubble bobble for friends is also out in Japan this week

1397
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:02,260
So lots of switch games in Japan this week

1398
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:08,700
And if I travel the PlayStation 4 I see a lot of the same things including lover kiss that same rock man zero and ZX

1399
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:10,460

1403
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:32,740
Bonafide edition that's on PlayStation 4 and switch. I guess that's a physical version of that

1404
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:36,440
real heroes firefighter on PlayStation 4

1405
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:43,820

1406
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:50,980
PlayStation 4 and Xbox one it kind of looks like motorstorm a little bit romance of the three kingdoms 14

1407
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:58,820
Looks like that's on PlayStation 4 the curious tale of the stolen pets on PlayStation 4

1408
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:01,300
Who would steal pets that's mean?

1409
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:04,180
Cruella de Vil I'm blaming her

1410
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:10,860
rune factory for special on Nintendo switch Metro redux on switch and

1411
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:16,940
See one punch man a hero nobody knows on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one and that's it

1412
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:20,380
All right, let's go to the mailbag every week

1413
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:25,640
You guys send us emails participate at orange lounge radio.com and we read some of our favorite emails here on the show

1414
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:28,260
We have one email to read tonight again

1415
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:31,820
That's participate at orange lounge radio.com if you want to send a mail for a future week

1416
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:36,340
But I will I will kind of like sneak in this a little shout out here because before I get to the email

1417
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:41,740
Because a lot of times why why our emails us during this segment he didn't email us this week

1418
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:47,980
But I did notice in discord. He was asking for people if you did get a code for sharpshooter plus from him last week

1419
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:50,700
Please make sure you go in and try out the game

1420
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:54,460
As soon as you can just because he's trying to get some scores on the leaderboards

1421
01:46:54,460 --> 01:46:58,300
He wants to be able to test multiple pages. He doesn't quite have enough scores to do that yet

1422
01:46:58,300 --> 01:47:02,220
so if you did get the code last week go in and check it out, it's a fun game and the

1423
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:07,780
Interesting thing is that whole flash thing that came up he had that fixed within two hours after the show

1424
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:12,960
So it comes right up on the screen when you start it and it says do you want the flash on or off?

1425
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:15,740
So he he heard that feedback loud and clear

1426
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:21,500
So if that was if that was like giving you pause or whatever on trying it just know he addressed that already

1427
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:26,440
So we we love developers that fix those type of issues real fast when it comes to accessibility. Very cool

1428
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:31,900
So anyway, yes, I do give sharpshooter plus a try if you did receive a code last week. So cool

1429
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:34,420
All right. Anyhow, let's go to the emails

1430
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:41,500
In our email this week our loan email this week is from our pal DJ rama s. Hey, let's get to it

1431
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:44,900
Greetings all a couple things I wanted to share first off

1432
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:50,300
I didn't realize how much of an amazing deal game pass is since installing it. I found myself trying out games

1433
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:54,380
I've enjoyed and also hated this service has saved me a few dollars on buying games

1434
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:59,720
I realized this as I was turning in game pass quests and noticed DMC 5 was their score

1435
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:03,160
Which on a side note not in the email, but I figured I'd give this shout-out

1436
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:07,820
My game pass was set to finally expire this month because you know

1437
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:10,960
I did that thing where I converted all of my remaining lifetime for like a dollar

1438
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:14,500
Yeah, so if yours is going to be running out sooner, you just want to extend that

1439
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:18,200
I know some of you were able to get like years and years out so you don't even care but

1440
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:24,660
For those like me who didn't know those little deals and things at the time and who are now converting to a month-to-month thing

1441
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,360
Right now I think still our at least two days ago when I bought it

1442
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:32,340
You can get a three month ultimate pass

1443
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:37,800
Which is the Xbox gold and the Xbox game pass on both platforms three months is 25 bucks

1444
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:42,720
And that would usually be closer to 45 because I think it's like 14 bucks a month or something like that. So

1445
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:46,960
Almost any retailer is matching that right now

1446
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,400
So I used Amazon

1447
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:55,180
But I I'm not saying you have to use Amazon for that sale check your other retailers because those game cards are real cheap right now

1448
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:59,500
So even if you have a recurring thing like I do you just put in the code and it extends it by three months

1449
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:02,100
So now I'm paid through June cool as mine was about to expire

1450
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:06,340
Like I didn't even realize it until I was told about the sale and then I went in and did that so

1451
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:11,180
You can use whatever retail your want because that's not an ad for any type of marketplace

1452
01:49:11,180 --> 01:49:18,200
It's just the one I particularly used but I think they're all matching it. Anyway, let's go back to DJ Rama SS email

1453
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:24,020
Secondly as I've mentioned previously, I had a nasty hard drive failure back in November

1454
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:28,980
I continue to sort through my files and see what I need and whatnot. I realized I was low on music

1455
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:33,660
Especially remixes first thing I did was download my exit tunes albums

1456
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:41,540
Exit tunes that's the name of it exit tunes is a series of remixed anime and pop music that started back in the 2000s

1457
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:48,140
Think of it as an equivalent of the dance mania CDs that came out and for those that don't know just as an aside here

1458
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:55,480
A lot of that early dance dance revolution music like, you know, the iconic dance dance revolution song the butterfly, right?

1459
01:49:56,700 --> 01:50:01,220
I'm your little butterfly in that song that came from a dance mania album

1460
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:02,340
So that's you know

1461
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:07,340
That was a Konami had a license agreement with Toshiba EMI in Japan to use

1462
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:11,340
Certain songs from those dance mania collections in dance dance revolution

1463
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:13,180
So just a little background if you don't know what we're talking about

1464
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:19,140
You know, I know not all of you were here when we were exclusively talking about music games or you weren't even born

1465
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:26,540
Yeah, right. So that's where that's what dance mania CDs are. So they were kind of like that collection and sadly

1466
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:32,940
Excuse me. Sadly. I have a cough sadly those dance mania CDs. You can't find them on Spotify

1467
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:40,100
And so forth there's there's a playlist where somebody compiled a bunch of songs that were on those collections

1468
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:45,460
So you can kind of like halfway get there, but it's not quite the same as it was

1469
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:51,460
I also really enjoyed Fantasia, which was the trance collections. Yeah, but those are also not on

1470
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:55,360
Spotify or any of that stuff bummer. I wish they would be anyway

1471
01:50:55,620 --> 01:51:00,240
Sorry for I keep derailing DJ Rama S's email, but I think with good reason. I think he's okay with it

1472
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:06,960
So anyway, where were we exit tunes in the 2000s think of it as an equivalent of the dance mania CDs that came out

1473
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:14,080
There is one subset of exit tunes called he may trance I had started listening to those albums and oh my god

1474
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:20,360
These albums are an ultimate throwback to 2000s anime and DDR music. Here's a link to one of the albums

1475
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:25,640
It's a deep link on CD Japan if you want to see that scroll down and see the track listing

1476
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:31,440
Also, here's a link to all of the albums on that Dropbox link with that one. So thank you very much, sir

1477
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:35,760
I'll be checking that out. He may trance 2 is the album. I referenced in the prior link

1478
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:40,280
So take a look poke around and tell me that some of these songs aren't an epic throwback

1479
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:44,180
Now I must return to sorting through my restored drive back up and whatnot

1480
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:51,040
14 terabytes is a lot of stuff. Yes, it is. So, let's see. I'm trying to see what the track list is

1481
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:57,400
Oh, here we go. Oh my oh so butterfly upswing mixes on that cartoon heroes

1482
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:04,580
Erotic max don't have sex with your ex pya pya. There's a lot of throwback DDR songs on this Wow

1483
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:06,860
Send your Rita the speedy mix

1484
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:08,700
So these are all for those that have no idea what I'm talking about

1485
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:14,780
These are all like old ass DDR songs on this CD. So they just be like trance versions of those songs. It's kind of fun

1486
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:20,360
Yeah, so like I'm gonna check that out after the show. There was something I posted on Twitter earlier this week

1487
01:52:21,020 --> 01:52:24,900
That was something I discovered after listening to the Gus in a podcast

1488
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:31,100
it's this and I don't remember the artist's name, but they basically he's like a

1489
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:33,100
Like

1490
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:37,620
Almost like a Captain Jack type of guy like and he even covers Captain Jack and stuff

1491
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:40,580
But it'll Captain Jack passed away. So take your shoes

1492
01:52:40,580 --> 01:52:46,420
so so it's like that like weird Europe euro pop stuff, but like it's also extremely perverted like the

1493
01:52:48,820 --> 01:52:50,740
Like

1494
01:52:50,740 --> 01:52:55,900
What the hell the alligator project or whatever something like blow my whistle baby sort of sort of like that

1495
01:52:55,900 --> 01:53:01,500
But it's it's it's form but like they a lot of the songs it just reminded me a lot of that and he also has

1496
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:03,500
a persona that looks like barf from

1497
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:08,400
You can't do that on television. So it's kind of weird seeing that but

1498
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:14,100
It's like barf or

1499
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:18,820
Barf I'm sorry bar burgers barf or

1500
01:53:18,820 --> 01:53:20,580
Yes

1501
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:25,960
barf or like Beetlejuice, it's like that look it's just really weird but like

1502
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:29,920
Like I could totally see that. Oh my god. That's a dragon con cosplay

1503
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:33,900
I want to do but he does covers of like he does covers like the kind of changes them

1504
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:38,140
But he did cover of like some Abba songs as well. Wait, wait, hold on. Hold on. We need to take a step back

1505
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:43,020
What is your mom s have you ever seen somebody cosplay barf from part the burgers?

1506
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:46,100
At a con cuz I think I want to do that. That's awesome

1507
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:55,580
That's a deep cut that is a deep cut but that's those are the types of costumes that are the best that like

1508
01:53:56,100 --> 01:54:00,140
Like 98 people you walk by are not gonna understand it

1509
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:07,020
But the two that do are gonna be like that is fucking awesome. I want to picture right? That's that's the best

1510
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:11,420
Oh, Bobby says I've seen that at dragon con. Damn it. Yeah, of course. They've done it at dragon con

1511
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:14,420
So they feel like dragon con is the Simpsons did it of cosplay?

1512
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:17,180
Well, I love the idea

1513
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:20,420
I still think I might want to do it or some some you can't do that on television

1514
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:25,540
Reference because there's there's a lot of like really deep references if I had a lady companion

1515
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:30,500
To dress up as the mom with that very distinct like blue polka dot dress and the the gloves

1516
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:35,180
What other you could be the locker jokes, it would be very very intricate

1517
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:42,140
You could do it like two people in a locker and it has the you can't do on television spray-painted in front of it

1518
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:44,140
You could do it. So

1519
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:50,860
I love the great. Yeah, that was I fucking love that show growing up. So that's great. All right

1520
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:55,020
There's so many so many people in their 20s and 30s that have no idea what we're talking about

1521
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:56,660
You just had to go to YouTube and look it up

1522
01:54:56,660 --> 01:55:00,340
It was like a kids show that was on Nickelodeon back in the 80s and it was it was everything

1523
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:05,260
Anyway, all right. Um, that was it for emails. Thank you. Did you hear on the s?

1524
01:55:06,140 --> 01:55:09,320
From trance CDs to you can't do that on television sketches

1525
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:15,440
Just another mailbag success story. All right, we will get to discord before too long

1526
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:20,560
So if you do want to participate with discord tonight, you can head on over to our discord server over at vog network.com

1527
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:27,200
Discord that's VOG network comm discord and hang out in our green room and you might just want to mention what you want to call

1528
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:29,280
In and talk about tonight in the orange launch radio channel

1529
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:33,920
Especially if I don't know your name because it's how I like to kind of weed out some of the people that you know

1530
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:37,120
Maybe you shouldn't come on here, but most people have been pretty good about that

1531
01:55:37,120 --> 01:55:39,800
So, yeah, we'll get to that a little bit

1532
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:42,160
But first we have some more news stories for you guys Loki

1533
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:46,960
So Randy Pitchford made an announcement on Twitter saying that they he is very excited to welcome

1534
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:53,580
Eli Roth as a director of the Borderlands movie in development with Lionsgate and arid productions

1535
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:59,640
so apparently there's gonna be more news coming from PAX East on the 27th, but

1536
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:02,800
I'm excited for that

1537
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:08,460
Eli Roth and a lot of those like really gory movies like hostile was not him and like cabin fever

1538
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:13,120
Like weren't those all Eli Roth? I think they were those are kind of nasty movies

1539
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:18,700
So, I mean if this is gonna be ultraviolet like the old game is ultraviolet. Yeah, I'm kind of okay

1540
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:20,680
Yes, I guess it's why you know, you know

1541
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:22,680
I'm not a big fan of like the gore and stuff like that

1542
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:29,760
But I guess if it's if it's comical like a Deadpool type thing. I might be that's the right people for it

1543
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:35,440
Yeah, if it's if it's done right if it's the right balance of humor I might be able to overlook it

1544
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:39,960
So I think it's I'd say it. I think we're gonna see a lot of

1545
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:44,000
Video-game movies all of a sudden because just in the past year

1546
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:50,440
You've had Detective Pikachu and Sonic do very well now granted both of those are family and I wouldn't call Borderlands a family thing

1547
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:50,920
Yeah

1548
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:56,200
Now the Witcher the Witcher was well not family and that's done one of the movies that my kids are asking me to go see

1549
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:00,600
Or as I know the Witcher was a book they want to go see because I show them the trailer for it

1550
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:03,920
But I'm like, you can't go see that movie that that's not a movie for you

1551
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:09,920
It's a free guy with Ryan Reynolds the one where he's like an NPC and like Grand Theft Auto or something like that

1552
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:13,380
I'm like that movie is like one of my most anticipated movies of the year

1553
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:18,440
But I'm like, no you you cannot see that not for kids. No, yeah

1554
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:21,120
But I'm I'm totally gonna see that

1555
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:24,520
You're gonna go see it without him. I will go see it without them. Yes. There you go

1556
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:28,360
All right. So what do you think? What do you want to see out of a Borderlands film?

1557
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:32,120
Do you think this is a good pairing? Do you think Eli Roth will hopefully do a fucking care?

1558
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:37,360
It's just it's a movie. It's with Borderlands. I don't care who's doing it. As long as it's not a way bowl

1559
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:41,880
We're good. He's not doing movies anymore. I think you a bowl has been chased out of the industry

1560
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:46,620
So that's that's that I forget what he's doing, but he does non Hollywood related things now

1561
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:51,440
He does convention appearances though. I know because they had him at one of the conventions here. Yeah, so I've talked to him on the phone

1562
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:52,440
once

1563
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,440
We interviewed him. Oh

1564
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:58,080
Yeah, I remember you talking about that wasn't for this show. No, it's my work

1565
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:00,840
because we had a

1566
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:05,600
Magazine that we used to put out. Yeah, and so we interviewed him for tunnel rats his

1567
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:11,500
His move his one that it kind of went the reverse. He he made a movie then he made a game based off of it

1568
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:16,160
So that's kind of ironic. Well when plan a doesn't work. Yeah, try plan B. But yeah

1569
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:23,160
He was he was he was okay. I mean he wasn't like his ass hole issues. You would think he was decent

1570
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:28,640
He's just a person. He's just a person. That's right. A lot of that stuff is personalities and you know personas

1571
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:34,360
I guess anyway, yeah. All right. Well, let's move on to an interesting rumor, but it is a rumor

1572
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:39,640
So take it with a big grain of salt, but it has to do with Diablo and overwatch pass pass

1573
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:42,280
passively possibly becoming

1574
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:46,800
Animated series and this is because of a linked in profile update

1575
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:54,280
So it was Activision's president Nick Van Dyke who actually added some interesting notes on their LinkedIn profile

1576
01:58:54,920 --> 01:59:02,160
saying quote executive producer of Diablo a TV adaptation of Blizzard Entertainment's IP and then was also

1577
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:07,520
mentioning in the same experience section saying that it was it's being rendered in an anime style and it's in

1578
01:59:07,940 --> 01:59:12,720
Pre-production for a worldwide distribution through Netflix and then also on the same profile

1579
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:17,240
It says developed and sold an animated series based on Blizzard's overwatch franchise

1580
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:23,440
Of course, we all know overwatch 2 is coming out later this year and it would honestly just makes it those like those shorts

1581
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:26,120
Yeah, very well. I was gonna say those shorts are fantastic

1582
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:30,780
So like give me more that please make a series out of it seems or just a feature-length movie like that

1583
01:59:30,780 --> 01:59:36,960
Like I would watch that now here's something where I think I don't know about Diablo though. Here's I think it'll be fine

1584
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:40,760
I hear something where the success of The Witcher I think has had a direct or Castlevania

1585
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:45,520
Or that or just in general you have the video game stuff on Netflix, you know, and again

1586
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:49,780
I know The Witcher was not originally video games, but let's be real that has an impact

1587
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:53,440
So I think because of the success of those types of things, you know

1588
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:58,200
Even even more minor and and cultish games like Ingress, you know have their shows on Netflix

1589
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:00,200
I could not get into that series

1590
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:04,360
I know people always watch me if I've seen the anime yet and I'm like and I watched like the first

1591
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:08,040
Episode or two of that and I was like, I don't know what's going on

1592
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:12,960
So I need to give it a fair shot but like all my friends that are in Ingress who have watched it are like

1593
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:19,880
Like I'm like, I'm like will this explain the story to me? I'm like, I still don't know what the fuck's going on. Yeah

1594
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:26,460
S2 100 Matt says Diablo being done in the style of Castlevania animated series on Netflix would be great

1595
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:30,880
Yeah, I mean in theory these will be very good because Blizzard cinematics are like some of the best things

1596
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:31,800
So as long as some of it

1597
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:36,900
I mean obviously they're probably gonna have to bring in more people in another studio to probably handle some of the animation

1598
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:41,100
But as long as some of the writing kind of remains consistent what they're doing today

1599
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:46,640
This has the potential to be very successful in a place where sorry all TL shade

1600
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:48,640
The games have not been doing very well lately

1601
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:54,120
So maybe this is something to help help blizzard out a little bit in Activision in general

1602
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:59,140
So anyway, it's very strange that the president of Activision would tweak their LinkedIn

1603
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:03,740
I mean people update their LinkedIn profiles all the time to kind of brag about their current projects

1604
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:09,180
So obviously this one was kind of a bad timing sort of situation, especially from somebody who ought to know better

1605
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:14,860
But oopsie daisy, so it's out there. So this is one of those things where it's like, well, it's a rumor

1606
02:01:14,860 --> 02:01:20,700
But at the same time like why in the fuck with the president of Activision put this out there if it was just made up

1607
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:26,100
Right, right. So this that's why I know sometimes y'all don't like me reporting on rumors and stuff

1608
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:30,580
But this one's a little different. I really think this is just the case of oops

1609
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:35,100
Somebody forgot that the cat's not out of the bag on that one yet

1610
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:41,140
Cuz I'm sure presidents of companies have lots of secrets and sometimes it's hard to keep track of what have we told the public?

1611
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:44,200
What have we not told the public up? So anyhow, there you go

1612
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:49,500
No official comment from Activision Blizzard on this leak as of yet

1613
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:53,340
Although I assume now that this is maybe out there especially coming from the president

1614
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:58,420
Maybe we'll get some kind of confirmation in this next week in the time period that OLR is gonna be off for a little bit

1615
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:02,300
That'll be pretty cool. Maybe we'll know more are they both animated?

1616
02:02:02,620 --> 02:02:08,340
Is it some of the same same creative minds buying Castlevania? Hopefully give you some of the more detail behind this

1617
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:10,340
So I think I think it's pretty cool

1618
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:16,740
Phoenix 77 26 in our chat asking. Can I get a Starcraft animated series too? That would be great

1619
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:20,060
Well, I mean if Diablo and overwatch do well

1620
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:25,380
I imagine it's just a matter of time before they want to do things like Starcraft and I'm sure they would want to reapproach

1621
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:30,580
Warcraft you know just because the movie came out a few years ago, and I know it did well in China

1622
02:02:30,580 --> 02:02:34,700
But for most of the world it didn't do so hot. I'm sure they might just say, okay

1623
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:37,220
We're rebooting Warcraft, but this time as a TV show, right?

1624
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:42,420
I mean, I was just reading I fell in a Wikipedia hole last night, you know, you know how that goes

1625
02:02:42,420 --> 02:02:45,180
Yeah, I'm up late. I'm on Wikipedia. I almost forgot with the Warcraft movies

1626
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:46,860
I fell down a Stephen King

1627
02:02:46,860 --> 02:02:51,540
So I didn't even realize that they adapted the mist into a movie but the mist also became a TV show

1628
02:02:52,020 --> 02:02:56,260
It was only on for one season recently, but yeah, yeah the mist was a TV show as well

1629
02:02:56,260 --> 02:03:00,320
So it's one of those things was like just because there was a movie doesn't mean they can't just come back and do a TV

1630
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:03,500
Show as well ten years later. There's so many movies. They've just been

1631
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:11,400
Redoing or now it's a new show or what? Fuck. Look at all the matrix for super excited. There's that I can't wait

1632
02:03:11,860 --> 02:03:16,900
Or day one fucking Disney's live-action remakes right like Lion King and Aladdin those movies

1633
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:20,220
Those were kind of late a lot looks okay and Milan looks pretty good

1634
02:03:20,220 --> 02:03:22,740
I watched like half of Aladdin on Disney Plus, but then I fell asleep

1635
02:03:23,260 --> 02:03:28,120
I'm not gonna watch either one of those but like move on looks good and then god forbid

1636
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:30,120
They have the lady in the trampoline too and no

1637
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:35,960
as she 100 Matt with a good thought on when we might really hear more about this as she 100 Matt says if they're

1638
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:42,100
Hiring now then maybe they're still in the early stages. Maybe this was a Blizzcon 2020 announcement

1639
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:45,900
Oh, that's a good thought something to wait and show at the main stage of Blizzcon

1640
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:50,420
Cuz they're not gonna be able to keep putting out huge boys every single. Don't you all have Netflix?

1641
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:56,980
Moving on a few more stories for you guys Loki

1642
02:03:56,980 --> 02:04:01,780
So this is interesting whereas a lot of people are getting away from the toll toys to life stuff

1643
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:07,080
Or the you know different toy integrations with games aside from Nintendo

1644
02:04:08,420 --> 02:04:10,420
apparently

1645
02:04:10,420 --> 02:04:13,020
The folks behind Minecraft Earth are

1646
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:19,300
Thinking otherwise so they are developing along with Mattel some RFID

1647
02:04:20,580 --> 02:04:22,220
our NFC

1648
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:24,220
like characters a little

1649
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:31,780
It's like a little mini amiibo type things that you can integrate with the game. There's gonna be 20 to collect and

1650
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:39,380
It'll also apparently I guess these little mini figures are going to cost five dollars each

1651
02:04:39,460 --> 02:04:44,140
One of these are gonna be like in blind bags or something because this looks like something small at the word

1652
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:51,660
$5 isn't so bad at least way down from the price of amiibos. So apparently yeah, you can scan them and unlock different

1653
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:55,780
things with different abilities, I guess for a limited time and

1654
02:04:56,900 --> 02:05:01,480
What the fuck is that thing? I don't know but like they have like some giant like

1655
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:07,460
There's all these things in Minecraft. You're like, I don't remember that in Minecraft like I don't think that's in my craft

1656
02:05:07,460 --> 02:05:09,700
They have like a lot of weird things that they have in there

1657
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:13,520
maybe I it may be something that's coming in like minecraft dungeons or something like that, but

1658
02:05:14,420 --> 02:05:19,280
And then they also have if you don't want to pay five dollars for each and you just want to collect a little minifigures

1659
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:21,580
they've got

1660
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:28,520
Minecraft minis that don't interact with minecraft earth and those are only three dollars for 50 cents a pop and they've got like different ones

1661
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:32,300
Along with that and some of these are pretty cute. They got like a pig playing in mud

1662
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:40,300
Well, you've been playing minecraft earth more than I have is not so much recently not doesn't this doesn't really I kind of got bored

1663
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:44,420
With it. Yeah, like I it was there wasn't enough there to keep it interesting

1664
02:05:44,420 --> 02:05:48,900
They should have baked for a while. I mean like the gameplay is okay, but there's like no point to it

1665
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:51,820
It's like you can't collect blocks and you make stuff in Minecraft

1666
02:05:51,820 --> 02:05:58,340
It's like yeah, and it wasn't so much like no one else was really playing it that I knew and so it didn't make any sense

1667
02:05:58,340 --> 02:06:00,740
The kind of like team up with somebody to build something

1668
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:07,880
And it's just I don't know. It just wasn't worth it. So I just stopped playing it. All right fair enough blame Orna for that

1669
02:06:08,940 --> 02:06:09,900
All right

1670
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:14,060
Well one more story for you guys and it has to do with old things being new again

1671
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:19,580
And this has to do with Tiger electronic gaming handhelds. You remember? Yeah, okay

1672
02:06:19,580 --> 02:06:21,420
So for those I had a Simon's Quest one

1673
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:24,520
I used to play the shit out and I don't have pictures to put on the screen

1674
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:26,860
I'm sorry, but for the podcast listeners that have to describe anyway

1675
02:06:26,860 --> 02:06:32,180
But it's like those old-school LCD where it's like burn-in right there. It's like calculator graphics

1676
02:06:32,180 --> 02:06:35,140
Yeah, the calculator graphics are like the little like, you know

1677
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:43,260
Or like think mr. Game & Watch right mr. Game & Watch from Nintendo those that was a whole line of Nintendo things like that

1678
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:45,900
So Tiger electronics had their own line of those

1679
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:53,220
This is something where Hasbro is bringing these back. So I don't know exactly which games they are saying

1680
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:55,620
Oh, you know why we do know here we go. The Little Mermaid

1681
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:58,200
Sonic the Hedgehog 3

1682
02:06:58,200 --> 02:07:03,580
I'll tell you guys if that game is gonna play nothing like the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 you remember the the thing about those games

1683
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:05,580
They're really not very good

1684
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:12,920
But for the technology at the time like those things were probably huge right before the Game Boy really took off

1685
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:19,460
And then once the Game Boy had the technology there those things died because they were crap compared to the Game Boy

1686
02:07:20,020 --> 02:07:25,660
But you know, so so they're definitely the product of an era that most people have moved on from but if you are

1687
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:29,700
You're big on your retro stuff. Why not? I collect these shitty little arc

1688
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:36,700
Do they have emulators for those because I I gotta imagine they have emulators for those they've got although would you really be emulating the firmware?

1689
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:41,320
Is it just like somebody recreated them or something? It would probably be just emulating all the chips in there

1690
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:44,840
Yeah, like it would be recreating them of it. Anyway the other games

1691
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:52,000
Transformers generation 2 and x-men project X these games are inspired by their original counterparts

1692
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,200
But they do have some changes to design and functionality

1693
02:07:54,840 --> 02:08:00,320
No rechargeable batteries. Sorry, you're still gonna need to double-a batteries batteries not included

1694
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:06,920
As any kid who grew up in the 80s or 90s could tell you from the commercials batteries not included

1695
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:13,520
When they're a movie called that isn't there was there was such a such a well-known catchphrase

1696
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:16,200
I think there was a two of them actually. Yeah. Yeah

1697
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:21,400
So anyhow 15 bucks if you want to get one, but at the same time and I think this is kind of

1698
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:23,360
What is being said as chat?

1699
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:23,520
Yeah

1700
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:26,800
dark tetsuya and chat says but my thing is how much those mini arcade

1701
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:30,920
Tabletops Unix cost for the price of two of those tiger handhelds you could get one of those

1702
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:33,520
Yeah, it depends which series you're buying from

1703
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:37,440
I think this my arcade that I've seen mostly at Target

1704
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:41,240
These are about 35 bucks a pop like this burger time one. I'm pointing out on cam

1705
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:44,160
This is about 35 bucks and I think these are pretty rock-solid

1706
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:50,160
I don't know like bit bigger than the $20 equivalent bought at Walmart arcade class who of the

1707
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:55,480
Stranger Things ones because we were gonna give them to our cousins for like stranger thing ones are garbage though

1708
02:08:55,840 --> 02:09:00,040
Exactly, but my kids love them. They play them all the time. And so

1709
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:02,720
yeah, they are hot garbage, but

1710
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:04,240
I

1711
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:07,200
Don't be like him. I'm good tip from Tiger Claw

1712
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:14,860
I would have never thought to check here Tiger Claw and chat says the Internet Archive does have emulation of those old LCD games

1713
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:17,120
archive org

1714
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:18,480
details

1715
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:22,640
Handheld history. How about that? That's it? That was a very clever place to look kudos for you

1716
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:27,080
So yeah, it would be a good point if you want to check out what some of those games were, you know

1717
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:30,000
And it's it's just they're just bad by at the time

1718
02:09:30,480 --> 02:09:34,720
They were the types of things you would play in the back of the car if they didn't get you motion sick and

1719
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:39,480
it was you know something where you just would try to go for a high score and obscenely simple game as

1720
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:45,440
A lot of those Atari 2600 games and early video games were they were just very simple games to you know

1721
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:50,960
Before things got all you know fancy. So alright, there you go

1722
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:56,400
I'm just gonna check to see if we have anybody and if you have anything in chat any questions you want to ask

1723
02:09:56,400 --> 02:09:58,240
Yeah, we don't have anybody on discord yet

1724
02:09:58,240 --> 02:10:00,080
But who knows that might change?

1725
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:01,440
I'll give it a couple minutes

1726
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:05,100
But if you have any questions for us or things you want us to talk about in our chat

1727
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:10,040
Go ahead and ask right now over twitch.tv slash vog network vog network

1728
02:10:10,040 --> 02:10:14,520
I don't know if we have any last-minute stories tonight. I think I do actually so

1729
02:10:15,120 --> 02:10:19,560
Let's talk a little bit. This is going back in history here. So apparently

1730
02:10:20,720 --> 02:10:25,600
Rockstar is not or I should say take two is not too happy with a certain mod

1731
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:31,280
That was just created for Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC. Oh the hot coffee. I heard about this

1732
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:35,240
I thought about it. They have a show that I coffee mod for now

1733
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:40,720
What's a little bit different with this one, but I guess they're just not they don't care about the details

1734
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:46,120
Is that there's no nudity in it. It's just it's using assets from the game

1735
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:52,320
No nudity, and I mean you're really already in the game. You can get a hand job from somebody so like I

1736
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:55,200
Mean really is it that much of a stretch?

1737
02:10:56,160 --> 02:10:58,000
so apparently

1738
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:02,520
Take two is actually filed a lawsuit against them or a cease-and-desist Wow

1739
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:08,240
And they've basically said no, I'm not taking it down because it doesn't violate any of the stuff. It's not online

1740
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:13,400
I'm on it's it's it's on P. It's only on single-player. It's not online

1741
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:19,000
There's because they're saying that it's violating the end-user license agreement for the online portion of Grantham auto

1742
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:21,800
Grand the vote read the redemption to

1743
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:26,420
Which to be fair is probably copy pasted from the Grantham total one. Yeah, so

1744
02:11:27,240 --> 02:11:31,880
Apparently these yeah the mod does not contain a nudity or nude models. They only uses assets

1745
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:38,320
They're currently in the game the animations are from the bar mission with Lenny and the moaning sounds are from character injuries

1746
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:44,200
So it's just it's all using in-game assets so fascinating to see these companies going after mods

1747
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:46,640
They don't like you know this kind of reminds me of

1748
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:48,480
Recently there was a fight

1749
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:48,680
well

1750
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:49,000
I mean

1751
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:56,280
it's I don't know how recent but there's a Final Fantasy 14 nude mod out there where you can basically mod your Final Fantasy 14 game so

1752
02:11:56,280 --> 02:11:59,220
Then even the little Lala fells are naked if that's what you're really into

1753
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:05,960
And there was a live letter that was done with the producers of the game and they spent some time at the beginning going

1754
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:12,520
Basically, like will you guys knock that shit off basically like not in those exact words, but in a very polite, you know way

1755
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:15,040
The culturally appropriate way

1756
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:20,720
they were basically saying we do not approve of those and we really wish you guys would stop because you're making us look bad and

1757
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:24,560
It's not good that these things are like very easily Googleable and stuff like that

1758
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:27,320
And you know, we haven't really cracked down on mods

1759
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:31,880
But we're gonna start if this type of stuff doesn't like, you know get taken away

1760
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:34,440
So I'm paraphrasing a lot and cutting some corners

1761
02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:38,960
But it's it just kind of makes me think of that where like there's probably and it's probably not just limited to these guys

1762
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:40,640
There's a lot of game developers out there who are like

1763
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:45,920
will you please not do nude mods of our game because then if somebody Google sit and finds that they're gonna think it's us and

1764
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:52,240
It's not because people don't know how to tell the difference, right? And so yeah, that's you know, definitely a concern

1765
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:56,680
So, um, but it's also kind of a Streisand effect, you know, y'all know that too, right?

1766
02:12:56,680 --> 02:13:02,240
y'all heard that before right because now that you've said because that was me me when I heard Final Fantasy 14 at nude mods I

1767
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:05,720
Was like really? I mean not that I would install it check this out

1768
02:13:05,960 --> 02:13:11,600
How easy is it to get on the computer I'm curious and I did Google the pictures I saw and I laughed and I was like

1769
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:14,020
That's so stupid and that's as far as I went with it

1770
02:13:14,020 --> 02:13:17,120
But I would have never thought to look if they hadn't said something about it

1771
02:13:17,120 --> 02:13:22,720
And so I feel like this Red Dead Redemption is gonna have some similar stuff. Yeah, so here's another cool thing

1772
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:27,460
So now we're speaking to mods. There's another mod that's been released that now

1773
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:35,400
It's by an individual named. Mr. Mr. Comet and it converts Mario 64 into

1774
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:37,840
Mario Party 64

1775
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:40,200
basically recreating the seven

1776
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:47,040
Levels in the game or some of the boards and then they also have 70 stars you can collect in different minigames in there as well

1777
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:50,300
So that's kind of cool and you can check that out as well

1778
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:56,920
And I did see one also for they did Mario Sunshine as well in Mario 64. So like some crazy mods there

1779
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:00,640
this one was also really cool that I saw is a

1780
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:05,000
Zombies ate my neighbors doom mod where you play the game

1781
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:10,880
In first person and that looks awesome. I saw that too that was really for that. All right

1782
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:12,400
Let me we do have a call waiting there

1783
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:13,840
They've been sitting in the green room for a little bit

1784
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:16,680
So I want to get to it here and then if you have anything else we can get to that

1785
02:14:16,680 --> 02:14:18,360
But first let's get to the call

1786
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:22,840
Excuse me. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on? Everybody is from though

1787
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:27,000
Hey Rama, it is good to hear from you again because we had the email earlier

1788
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,840
But that's I'm all for more Rama on the show

1789
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:34,840
Hey, I'll just say that you have a meaning to sit like the last couple of weeks

1790
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:36,960
But I've been so busy with work

1791
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:42,960
Personal life and all this other stuff. I found myself this week and I'm like, I have nothing to do

1792
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:49,560
I am gonna start gaming and catch up on some gaming and I'm like, I have an email to send I have time

1793
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:51,960
Let me go send it and then go back to play some more games

1794
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:55,640
I'm not one to criticize other things going on

1795
02:14:55,840 --> 02:15:01,440
Distracting from the usual commitments cuz I'm committing those offenses left and right when it comes to this year's show this month

1796
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:07,520
But it happens. I mean, what can you do? I I deeply appreciate those that stick by right but

1797
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:13,280
About these conventions real quick and I'll be on my merry little way and I

1798
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:19,520
Understand how you got Sony is backing out of PAX East which is going to have like a financial impact

1799
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:21,960
I can tell you this a few years ago

1800
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:27,720
There was a big anime convention in Baltimore called Otacon this convention alone

1801
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:34,600
For all the hotels the area brings in anywhere between two to five million dollars over a three-day weekend

1802
02:15:34,600 --> 02:15:37,020
There are hotels that were built

1803
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:41,840
Specifically for this convention because they realize that in three days

1804
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:48,880
They'll get at least all of their money back as opposed to an entire year now that the con has moved to DC

1805
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:54,120
It's helped the DC area somewhat but not so much of Baltimore

1806
02:15:54,120 --> 02:16:00,720
But I do get you know how something can happen it can cause a financial impact to the city, you know

1807
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,480
Yeah, well, that's why you have the mayor of Boston basically saying Sony

1808
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:09,400
I really wish you'd reconsider because you know, they do even though, you know, sometimes we go

1809
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:13,840
Oh, wow gaming conventions like a lot of people don't take us seriously as gamers and so forth

1810
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:19,740
Like, you know the reality is like these, you know, when you go to a gaming convention, you're paying hotels

1811
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:26,660
You're paying food and buying food there you're paying for other services souvenirs tourism if you've extended your day

1812
02:16:26,660 --> 02:16:31,300
Bye, you know trip by a day here or there like there's a lot of money that you spend in the city

1813
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:34,740
Like, you know think about how to think about how much money I've given Atlanta

1814
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:38,460
Over the past few years because of Dragon Con like it's a lot, you know

1815
02:16:38,460 --> 02:16:43,160
so it really does contribute to the city even even small and medium-sized cons like

1816
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:48,420
You know, it used to be such a small small con the sack anime that they would do here

1817
02:16:48,420 --> 02:16:54,140
but now it's a big deal in California the sack anime and like the the news stations cover it and everything and it's they

1818
02:16:54,300 --> 02:17:00,020
When they um, they are currently redoing the Convention Center in downtown Sacramento because it was a little bit old

1819
02:17:00,020 --> 02:17:01,420
So they're completely redoing it

1820
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:07,700
So sack anime had to relocate this year to where they do the state fair basically over at Cal Expo

1821
02:17:07,940 --> 02:17:11,020
and it was a big it was a big deal about how it it's

1822
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:16,680
The business is different at Cal Expo because it's not surrounded by all the eateries and everything

1823
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:20,440
So it's having a different economic impact and they really want to get it back downtown as soon as possible

1824
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:26,440
And I totally get that that's the main reason why Otacon moved because the convention center was getting old

1825
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:29,600
It was hitting capacity. They had to move somewhere else and

1826
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:35,880
And as for PAX, I mean the first year we all went it was at the hinds after that

1827
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:40,720
It's at the Boston Expo Center, which is basically a 15-minute walk from Chinatown

1828
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:43,600
So that's a double-edged sword not double-edged sword

1829
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:48,760
But you know, it's feeling the impact and people are really being hysterical when it comes to that

1830
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:51,040
I mean, so it's it's a little ridiculous

1831
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:54,040
But yeah, and I did we I went one year at the hinds

1832
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:57,240
But I that was the very first year of PAX East was at the hinds, right?

1833
02:17:57,240 --> 02:18:00,280
But I did go one year at the bigger Boston Convention Center. I did good

1834
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:03,200
And I will say um

1835
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:07,000
Damn, I just lost my train of thought on it. Never mind

1836
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:13,360
Okay, but I will say in regards to the whole coronavirus again another convention

1837
02:18:13,360 --> 02:18:15,360
50 years back catch the con

1838
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:22,800
Let's just say a lot of people was going to these conventions sick and actually caused a death of a someone higher up. I

1839
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:27,840
Really can't go into too much detail because I don't fully remember the story but it's out there

1840
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,600
I believe we covered it on our podcast

1841
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:36,840
But if you notice there is a trend and you always see at these conventions one person walking around with a sign that says if you

1842
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:39,680
Can afford the convention you can afford to shower?

1843
02:18:39,880 --> 02:18:46,400
Okay, seriously if you're spending all this money to go to a car the cosplay to buy swag

1844
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:53,640
You can go to the dollar store and buy soap you can go to the store and buy a washcloth

1845
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:58,040
I mean you're really with people even if you're not you got friends there

1846
02:18:58,040 --> 02:19:03,640
They're not going to say anything if you ask to borrow their shower for 15 minutes. I mean come on

1847
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:08,480
It's just sad how I see people spending all this money on swag

1848
02:19:08,480 --> 02:19:09,960
but it's like

1849
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:15,760
Yeah, I think I have money for you know, my shirt on a little more this or that. I'm like you need to stop

1850
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:19,560
Just stop if you know that you can't afford it

1851
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:24,040
Don't go if you realize you're getting sick and the doctors are telling you you shouldn't go

1852
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:28,160
Don't go. Yeah, I and and and to be clear

1853
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:33,640
I specifically asked the doctor if I would be fine to go on this cruise with my whole strep issue and I got the all

1854
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:34,720
Clear so we're good

1855
02:19:34,720 --> 02:19:39,960
And I have a follow-up appointment this week just to double-check just because the symptoms aren't 100% gone yet

1856
02:19:39,960 --> 02:19:45,520
But sometimes it takes a little over a week. So yeah, so yeah, I mean listen to the doctors, but also

1857
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:49,800
Good hygiene is just very important and I think you know to kind of go back to the topic

1858
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:51,240
We were talking about earlier, you know

1859
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:57,640
Just if we we could go a long way in stopping con disease if so forth if everybody just practices good

1860
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:01,480
Hygiene wash your hands and sing happy birthday twice while you do it

1861
02:20:02,320 --> 02:20:04,320
All those all those good tips

1862
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:11,360
exactly, but I'm but the sad thing is you have people who who rather get up early and stay in the game room all day and

1863
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:16,800
You know, you know how bad the game rooms get the whole stereotype you walk in and in two seconds

1864
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:21,480
Like you just walk right out and people ask you why you're like won't you walk in and then you tell me?

1865
02:20:22,480 --> 02:20:28,900
Because it's it there's too many pigpens from the peanuts cartoons if you remember that too many pigpens in there

1866
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:31,000
Yeah

1867
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:32,160
Alright well Rama

1868
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:34,800
I appreciate your perspective because you go to a shitload of cons

1869
02:20:34,940 --> 02:20:41,520
Which people can always hear about over at anime jam session and I would be curious if the kovat

1870
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:46,880
Issues start to spill over into the anime stuff as well. Have you have you heard of anime?

1871
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:50,580
Oh my god. Oh, oh god

1872
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:54,440
Grab some grass and tea. Look I dealt with

1873
02:20:55,480 --> 02:20:57,040
the number of

1874
02:20:57,040 --> 02:21:01,400
Stupid people in regards to this. Okay, and what are the groups?

1875
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:07,840
I am a moderator in there was a series of post people asking if I order my cosplay from China

1876
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:13,640
Will the kovat disease be in my cosplay? Well, I guess I swear to god

1877
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:16,600
Why would?

1878
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:20,640
Thanks, I hate it

1879
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:22,320
I

1880
02:21:22,320 --> 02:21:28,200
Would thank the people in that group who explain you can't get sick that way. It's not airborne

1881
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:32,920
You're you're fine. If you want to get my cosplay, you're still scared by it

1882
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:37,320
It's a light sauce sprayed on your cosplay or taking it directly. Let's do it

1883
02:21:37,320 --> 02:21:41,880
That's why and doing that makes you feel better than do it, but in reality of it all

1884
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:48,960
Your cosplay is not infected. You can't mail the kovat virus to your enemies

1885
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:55,160
It's not like those fucking glitter bombs you can get on the internet. It's not like that

1886
02:21:57,720 --> 02:22:04,380
But okay, but on a okay, so what about on the more so obviously you're talking about just like, you know isolated idiocy

1887
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:09,000
What about something on the level of like Sony pulling out of packs like on a corporate level?

1888
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:14,040
Have you seen anything from the corporate level get affected by kovat on the anime side of?

1889
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:21,920
Not at all, but I will say this I'd say this coded virus happened a few months later down the line I

1890
02:22:22,480 --> 02:22:29,720
Will say the conventions on the West Coast would be affected more such as maybe anime expo or SD

1891
02:22:29,720 --> 02:22:33,000
CC of guests coming in I can see something

1892
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:39,660
Because you just from the mere fact that like flights are being cancelled to Hong Kong and stuff. Yeah, I could see that

1893
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:46,820
Yeah on the East Coast we get Japanese guests, but not as many as opposed to the West Coast

1894
02:22:46,820 --> 02:22:48,820
So it wouldn't be that bad of an issue

1895
02:22:49,460 --> 02:22:54,740
Well, we'll keep an eye on it because it will be interesting to see how things like maybe like anime expo and fanime and things

1896
02:22:54,740 --> 02:22:57,400
Like that are impacted. I'll be keeping an eye on that. That's for sure

1897
02:22:58,060 --> 02:23:00,060
Anyway, we'll leave we'll leave you on this note

1898
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:07,100
You got your rating from Phoenix 77 26 and chat who says Ron was rant gets a 5 out of 5 for volume and a 5

1899
02:23:07,100 --> 02:23:08,940
out of 5 for content

1900
02:23:08,980 --> 02:23:10,980
That's nothing

1901
02:23:11,620 --> 02:23:17,860
Watches anime jam session and just sees my reactions to some of the stories mako-chan gives me there every time

1902
02:23:17,860 --> 02:23:23,020
They've actually put my head. I've actually said, okay, that's it. Good night folks. We'll see you next week

1903
02:23:23,020 --> 02:23:27,540
I take the headphones off hang up on the mic and I just walk right away. I just walk away

1904
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:33,660
I'm just like no and that's that's probably the best commercial you could give for anime jam session

1905
02:23:33,660 --> 02:23:36,940
Which is hosted here Tuesday nights at VOC network

1906
02:23:37,740 --> 02:23:41,060
All right, my friend I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up but thanks for the call

So I would just would really thank you for that consideration and nice five star reviews and word-of-mouth tweets

1920
02:24:40,300 --> 02:24:42,300
Five star reviews on a place like iTunes

1921
02:24:42,620 --> 02:24:48,220
Listening on Spotify and sharing all those things help spread the word of orange launch radio because we are the show where every gamer has

A voice but we need to get more voices here so we can hear more great five out of five takes like what we heard

From DJ Rama s so there we go. Um, all right, so that's it for tonight's show

1924
02:24:59,180 --> 02:25:04,420
We will be back live in three weeks. And so I know that's a very long time

1925
02:25:04,420 --> 02:25:05,580
So again, sorry about that

1926
02:25:05,580 --> 02:25:10,980
But all I can say is I'm very much looking forward to my cruise after all the sick stuff that's been going on

1927
02:25:10,980 --> 02:25:17,540
I really really need it. There will be a taped show here at vog network that debuts March 1st

1928

1930
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:32,140
I'm talking too fast tonight who will still be here the weeks that we are gone

1931
02:25:32,140 --> 02:25:39,220
You'll have something new to see there, but we will be back live in three weeks and really appreciate you guys until this

1932
02:25:39,220 --> 02:25:41,220
We'll see you on March 15th

1933
02:25:41,220 --> 02:25:46,620
I guess that's it. That's all I can think of to say for now. So we're gonna go around and get the final thoughts

1934
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:50,260
Loki we'll see you in three weeks. Happy gaming

1935
02:25:50,260 --> 02:25:54,820
Hope you get to work on a game or something and maybe you'll go see see Sonic a second time

1936
02:25:54,820 --> 02:25:59,020
I don't know. Yeah, probably not. All right, that's fine. All right. Well, what what do you want to leave our listeners with tonight?

1937
02:25:59,020 --> 02:26:04,060
Um, I guess I'll just leave you guys with I don't know

1938
02:26:04,980 --> 02:26:11,980
Working more my game. I guess I don't know. I'm making a lot of progress. So it's been taking a long time, but like

1939
02:26:13,060 --> 02:26:14,660
Slowly, but surely

1940
02:26:14,660 --> 02:26:18,460
Yeah, all right, and my final thought tonight is

1941
02:26:19,320 --> 02:26:21,320
You know being sick sucks

1942
02:26:22,220 --> 02:26:27,940
Originally I kind of but here's the tea originally I felt kind of bad that I was gonna miss so much time

1943
02:26:27,940 --> 02:26:30,440
You know with the seven-day cruise, I'm missing two olr's

1944
02:26:30,440 --> 02:26:36,580
I'm missing a lot of work when I just started this new job and everything's fine with that because it was in my actually it's

1945
02:26:36,580 --> 02:26:39,120
Actually a condition of my acceptance. I already paid for this cruise

1946
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:41,520
So I get to take it guilt-free on that and all that stuff

1947
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:45,680
But my point is is that like with all this crap I've been through in the past year

1948
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:47,580
Just with being sick

1949
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:52,680
I had the sinus infection then I had the flu then I had that food poisoning in January remember that and now

1950
02:26:53,040 --> 02:27:00,520
This strep throat like honestly guys. I I I can't think of a nice way to put this. I deserve this time off. I

1951
02:27:01,220 --> 02:27:05,400
Deserve this time off and I am NOT gonna feel bad about taking it

1952
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:09,040
So as much as I appreciate you guys being here every week and so forth

1953
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:12,200
I hope you will understand and I know you do I know so many of you do

1954
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:16,900
Understand where I'm coming from when I say that so I am gonna fucking enjoy my time away

1955
02:27:16,900 --> 02:27:20,300
And I hope you guys have a lovely couple of weeks and we'll see you again in three weeks

1956
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:25,340
my only other final thought I want to say I didn't mention this earlier in the show, but today is also kind of a bit

1957
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:26,060
of a

1958
02:27:26,060 --> 02:27:32,540
special day for me because February 23rd is my mom's birthday and if you've been listening to the show for a while you will know

1959
02:27:32,540 --> 02:27:38,840
That I lost my mom in 2017. So she's no longer of this earth today would have been her 79th birthday

1960
02:27:38,840 --> 02:27:46,380
So I do just want to dedicate tonight's program to the memory of my mom. So I miss her greatly every day. So

1961
02:27:47,060 --> 02:27:52,940
That's that. I'll end it on that note. Okay, so alright, we're gonna wrap up. Happy gaming everybody

1962
02:27:52,940 --> 02:27:55,320
Enjoy the things you're playing be nice to each other online

1963
02:27:56,020 --> 02:27:57,860
Don't be a dick

1964
02:27:57,860 --> 02:27:59,720
Wash your ass

1965
02:27:59,720 --> 02:28:03,160
