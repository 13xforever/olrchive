00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,120

the works as well as a Fatal Frame movie which both entices me and scares me to my core.

And then in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network Tigerclaw is pointing out

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,680
it's also National Hedgehog Day.

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,120
Why am I not surprised to hear that from the Sonic the Hedgehog movie's biggest fan?

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,480
Techmaster Loki has some input.

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Hi, Loki.

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
I don't have any input.

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
Oh.

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
You stopped making up all these holidays.

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,480
It's not Hedgehog Day, it's Groundhog Day.

26
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,600
Yeah, I know it's, it's, it's, hi Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers, but I guess is it because hedgehogs

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,000
are adjacent to groundhogs?

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,280
No, they're kind of not even the same genus, I think.

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,360
I don't know if that's going to pick you up unless you hold that news.

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,880
We're trying out a new mic stand approach thing today.

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
But I think how's that?

33
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
Yeah, it's good.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,760
It puts my head on cam.

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,320
You might have to just kind of pick it up and hold it that way.

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
So all right.

37
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
Yeah.

38
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Anyhow.

39
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,280
Um, so I don't even know what to ask at the top of the show because we have a we kind

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,280
of like a lighter turnout than usual.

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,640
There's no Bobby to kind of start the viewing bandwagon here at VOG Network tonight.

42
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,640
There's that football game on television, which I I don't even know who's playing.

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,480
I want No, I do one of them San Francisco.

44
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,440
Because everybody here is losing their shit.

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
Exactly.

46
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,280
Because the local team Well, I hope I hope they're sporting well and made the best sports

47
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
or win.

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,360
Um, anyhow, we're gonna get into video games, though.

49
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,080
Let's just jump right into it.

50
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,200
Let's talk about what's going on here at the top of the show with some of the news about

51
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Warcraft three reforged Have you guys heard about Yeah, you're forged.

52
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,960
It's not a game I'm really interested in.

53
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,160
I didn't play a whole lot of the Warcraft RTS games aside from like maybe demos that

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,640
came with PC gamer.

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,320
But I hear that a lot of the stuff that they promised to fix and update and change on this

56
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
never happened.

57
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,940
Like, for example, they promised, you know, completely redone cutscenes and everything

58
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
in the game.

59
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,040
And apparently, they're exactly the same as they used to be.

60
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,380
Well, I thought some of that was intentional because when they originally revealed this

61
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,900
at BlizzCon, they said that Christy golden, who did a lot of the books was going to be

62
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,500
writing like kind of rewriting some of the dialogue to kind of match.

63
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,060
Well, they actually showed like the you cut some of the cutscenes like one of the cutscenes

64
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,900
in the game was actually in the trailer.

65
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,620
And it was like a very cinematic cutscene like they were going to be completely redoing

66
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,980
the way the cutscenes were.

67
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,580
And that's not what it looks like in the game interest or like redoing the the UI.

68
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,220
And that's not really a thing either.

69
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,820
And it seems like the only like some of the stuff in the game, like I'm trying to think

70
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,780
of all the like bullet points other people have said, like, I think the movement in the

71
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:59,660
game is like it it's locked down to 20 FPS or whatever, like the actual like unit movement

72
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,660
or whatever.

73
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,660
Yeah.

74
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,660
Which is kind of weird.

75
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,060
And then what was the other thing?

76
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,420
So the really the main thing that's been kind of like redone or whatever is like the graphics

77
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,060
which were outsourced to another company.

78
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,340
And then, of course, the wonderful brand new terms of service that can't miss out any of

79
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,260
that dota money clause, basically saying that, hey, anything they make for Warcraft three,

80
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,580
it's ours.

81
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,380
The thing that really and I just want to give full disclosure, OK, because I don't necessarily

82
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,180
want to totally dunk on this game because the reality is I have not played Warcraft

83
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,360
three reforge.

84
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,100
So I more just want to discuss some of like what I'm hearing about it online, because

85
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,820
it's somewhat making me apprehensive to want to, you know, I've had the Blizzard launcher

86
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,020
not on my computer for a little bit ever since some of the stuff that went on last year.

87
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,820
You know, we kind of talked about that.

88
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,220
I have still not really played Blizzard stuff, so they're refusing refunds to.

89
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,540
But I was thinking about getting into Warcraft three reforge because I remember I liked Warcraft

90
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,540
one.

91
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,540
I like Warcraft two.

92
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,180
Warcraft three came out at a time in my life when I wasn't really gaming.

93
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,460
So I was thinking maybe reforge would be a good time to pick it up.

94
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,460
But all this reaction I'm hearing is making me very apprehensive to pick it up.

95
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,700
And I'm kind of very curious about your guys's thoughts in our chat over at Twitch TV slash

96
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,140
VOG Network for those that are here tonight, especially if you have played Warcraft three

97
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,140
reforge.

98
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,580
I'm kind of curious about your reaction.

99
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,000
Is the Internet tending to overblow this out of proportion?

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,700
Because let's be real, that sometimes happens.

101
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,340
You know, for example, I would say a lot of the hysteria that went with Pokemon Sword

102
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,040
and Shield at the end of the day, it's the best fucking Pokemon generation I've played.

103
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,660
So I you know, you can't always trust the Internet polls.

104
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,140
But the reality is there's a lot of talk about this.

105
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,460
And what does take me by surprise, and I'll say this, what kind of takes me by surprise

106
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,460
with all this Warcraft three news is what they did to the old client.

107
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,260
I had no idea that this was happening.

108
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,980
So they've essentially, I guess, disabled the old client when it comes to online play.

109
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,480
You can still play offline Warcraft in the old client.

110
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,980
But if you want to play online, you have to get reforged.

111
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,580
But I think, like, I don't want to misstate it, because I believe you don't have to necessarily

112
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,940
spend the $30 because you own the old one, you just have to buy or you have to download

113
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,380
the problem people are having is that the old Warcraft three was like one gig, the new

114
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,740
one is like 28 gigs.

115
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,800
So you're having to download this new one so you can play online, which you can do without

116
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
having to buy it.

117
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,100
So it's not like they held everybody's old copy of Warcraft ransom.

118
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,980
But if you want to play the story mode in Warcraft three reforged and all that, then

119
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:38,680
you do have to pay the money to the 30 bucks or whatever in order to be able to do that.

120
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,660
And it's I'm kind of surprised that they just really kicked the old client in the shin like

121
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,560
that, because I always kind of got the impression that, you know, the people that were still

122
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,560
playing Warcraft three here in the year 2020, before reforged was out, probably weren't

123
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,240
interested in what reforged had to bring to the table.

124
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,620
So the fact that they disabled the old client, and now you have these terms of service about

125
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,680
you don't own your mod, that part is the part that I think is a little bit like even more

126
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,840
yikes, because now it's Oh, not only do you have to get on a new client, but now you have

127
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,240
to accept the terms of service that are going to say that we have a, I don't want to misappropriate,

128
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,700
but I believe it's that they have a stake in and you not even a sick, they fully own

129
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,100
anything that you create with it, including the fact that they can demand that you make

130
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,900
more like documents available for something and that like, continued work has to be done

131
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
on these things.

132
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
I don't know.

133
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,860
But it's very like aggressive the terms of service, which to me, if I was a modder, I

134
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,700
wouldn't be even interested in touching that stuff.

135
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,220
I've already decided that I'm not going back to anything Blizzard or Activision has their

136
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,000
fingers in.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,280
I'm sticking to those guns and I have zero interest in this.

138
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,740
If I'm going to play Warcraft, I have a CD or DVD in my house that I could play.

139
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,500
And if I need to emulate something to make it work, I can, I can watch the stuff online,

140
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,680
but they are not getting my money, especially now.

141
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,520
Well, what's shocking about this in some ways is that for the most part, dark soccer, what

142
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,600
you're saying, yes, you could play Warcraft one, you could play Warcraft two, you could

143
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,000
play Warcraft three story mode on your DVD.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,160
But the minute you tried to play Warcraft three online, which is probably, I know you

145
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,240
don't play a lot of games online, probably not something you would do anyway, but the

146
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,000
minute you tried to do that, you can't do that now without this new reforge client.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,500
Well be doing it, don't care.

148
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,940
But that's, but, but I mean, for the fact, I mean, what's, how do I, how do I eloquently

149
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,940
put this?

150
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,320
The fact that you're saying for the most part, I could go back to my old games and I can

151
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,960
go enjoy my old games.

152
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:47,520
You kind of can't, if you are an online gamer, let's say we have an alternate universe where

153
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,640
dark Sakura is a Warcraft three online troll, and she loves to play online and put man babies

154
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
in their place.

155
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:03,520
Well, I do that anyway, but the reality is for my situation, I don't give a fuck.

156
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,560
I know, but isn't that, isn't it kind of screwed up that maybe the alternate soft or alternate

157
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,800
universe dark Sakura who does enjoy multiplayer gaming can't do it for Warcraft three without

158
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,040
this new client, then there's better games.

159
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,600
There are other games that will do this.

160
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,520
If you want the lore, read the fucking books, maybe, but in the end, sometimes you've got

161
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,800
to put your stuff, your foot down.

162
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Yeah.

163
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,080
Sometimes you have to just say, you know, I am done like me and Facebook.

164
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,980
Interesting that you talk about the alternate, the, the, what you just said about go find

165
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,120
something else to play, because I don't think it made our show roll this week because I

166
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,320
can't remember if it happened in this last week or the week before, but we just had news

167
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,480
about torchlight and torchlight came out with some really big news that there, I forget

168
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,120
the original name of it now, but essentially their expansion, distant worlds or whatever

169
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
it was called.

170
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,520
So I know that wasn't the name, sorry, but they rebranded it as torchlight three and

171
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,240
it's going to be a traditional buy it once you get everything like it's the type of game

172
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,160
that, you know, because originally the original model was like a free to play microtransactions

173
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
driven thing.

174
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,320
Essentially the audience said, we'd rather not, thanks.

175
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,640
And they listened to their fan base and have reverted now to, okay, it's just torchlight

176
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,560
three and it's just like torchlight one and two, but with all the things you would expect

177
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,520
if we put the number three in front of it, new classes, new maps, blah, blah, blah,

178
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
blah, blah.

179
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,400
Now, if this was an Activision product, they would still charge you for the game and then

180
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,220
still, you know, why should we pick one model to business model to go with?

181
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,300
We can just charge you the $60 and charge you all the microtransactions like it was

182
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,460
a free to play game because we're Activision and fuck you.

183
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,420
Okay, so I'm going to turn to the chat room now because again, admittedly it's, it's a

184
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,260
little unfair of me to sit here and dunk on Warcraft three when I haven't played it myself.

185
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,680
I want to see what you guys in our chat over at twitch TV slash fog network have to say

186
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,580
and quest Buster shedding a little light on some things saying, clan support is gone.

187
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,140
Competitive ranked match mating ladders are gone.

188
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,660
Native land support is gone.

189
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,380
Oh, that's huge too.

190
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,380
The land thing.

191
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,140
And I bet, uh, this was the thing that happened with Diablo as well.

192
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,140
I remember that you couldn't do land anymore.

193
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,860
You know, the only way you can play Diablo three on land unmodded on the Nintendo switch.

194
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,860
Think about it.

195
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,860
What is the Nintendo switch now?

196
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,860
It's Nintendo.

197
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,860
Yeah.

198
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,820
Anyway, sometimes being 10 years behind the curve on online helps Nintendo.

199
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,700
This is one of those times anyway, uh, where was I on quest posters, comments here, uh,

200
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,660
custom campaigns cannot be loaded.

201
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,500
So say goodbye to the last 17 years of player made content.

202
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,020
If the game fails to connect to blizzard servers for any reason, you can still boot into single

203
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,660
player, but you can't save your progress for some reason.

204
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,520
Oh my gosh.

205
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,720
Blizzard missed the dota boat.

206
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,100
So now they're like, we need to be more aggressive now.

207
00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:00,020
So interesting point from quest buster and let's humor blizzard here for a minute.

208
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:05,420
Maybe part of the reason they want more ownership is because they didn't really get anything

209
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,240
out of defense of the ancients being a Warcraft three mod at the end of the day, because those

210
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,060
guys ended up going to valve and making dota two there.

211
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,440
I mean, yes, blizzard made their own.

212
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,700
There was originally blizzard dota, which then they got in that whole argument about

213
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,820
who owns the name dota, right?

214
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:28,300
And so blizzard made heroes of the storm, which was called blizzard dota at one point.

215
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,280
So this kind of begs the question, like blizzard being irritated that they couldn't have anything

216
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
behind.

217
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,220
Oh, they can't have all of the money where poor babies.

218
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:44,240
Oh, if only they had large franchises under their belt, I, I will humor that angle to

219
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,760
some extent on the basis that they're heroes of the storm.

220
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,180
So well, there would be, yeah, that's another issue.

221
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,620
There would be no dota without Warcraft three period, right?

222
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,960
You can't argue that.

223
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:04,560
So I can see it to that element, but to assert ownership over everything does feel a little

224
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,240
bit aggressive to me.

225
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,480
Like it just doesn't feel right.

226
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
It's a new game though.

227
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,600
They didn't like just repurpose Warcraft three for dota two.

228
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,560
They just built on, they rebuilt it from scratch.

229
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,440
So I'm sorry, you can't take ownership of a mod.

230
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Yeah.

231
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Yeah, I get it.

232
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
The original one was running in your engine or whatever, but now it's not.

233
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,600
So tough shit.

234
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
So I don't know.

235
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,560
This leaves me, this leaves me just feeling, I don't, I don't know.

236
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,920
Like I, isn't it, isn't, it's really like something to think that they should have ownership

237
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,800
of someone's own work, their mods.

238
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,480
Like I get it that it was a mod for a game or something, but that's not your work.

239
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,320
You may have built the tools for if you didn't want people making stuff with it, then don't

240
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,480
build the tools, but they, there would be no way there would be no shell for the tools

241
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,200
without their game, but I get it.

242
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:04,400
I understand, but you, in the end of the day, it comes down to that they're angry at themselves

243
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:10,880
for not putting more aggressive terms of use so that they could own other people's content.

244
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
I will agree with that.

245
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,800
Bethesda's doing now like, well, like Activision Blizzard's doing now.

246
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
That's pathetic.

247
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:24,760
I would say what this forcing the old Warcraft players to accept a new terms of service to

248
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:32,640
back park the car into ownership of mods that is way over the, that is not, that's overcompensating

249
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
what would have been.

250
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
And you know what?

251
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:40,120
It's great that we live in a time now where, you know, the easiest to make games as much

252
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,640
easier than it used to be.

253
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,600
And maybe some of these folks that are thinking about modding games like Warcraft three or

254
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,440
mastered whatever can decide, Hey, you know what?

255
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,240
Maybe instead I'll just go ahead and try something from scratch in like a unity or unreal engine

256
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,920
or something like that where I actually own the shit I'm putting together, which is what

257
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
Dota two is.

258
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Exactly.

259
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,360
Uh, is that in our chat at Twitch TV slash vog network says derivative works, not copyright.

260
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,680
So when you get into something where you've modded the game extensively, uh, is it a derivative

261
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
work?

262
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,200
Now I'm not a legal expert, so I don't know to what extent a mod could claim, but I would

263
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:23,000
imagine if ultimately the name Dota ended up with valve with the original mod creators,

264
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,800
then the courts must have, or I don't know, I think it was a settlement, so there really

265
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,600
was no court ruling, but I was going to say things did air on the side of the mod owners

266
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,680
got to keep the name blizzard and keep that name.

267
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,680
They had to change it to here.

268
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,880
Well, I could especially like, like say, okay, yeah, you, you have ownership of this mod

269
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,880
now.

270
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,400
However, I'm making my own thing.

271
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,600
Dota two, you have no ownership of that.

272
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,880
And they're mad that they didn't get in on that train when they could too bad.

273
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,400
You had an opportunity to compete in that space.

274
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,800
You did it poorly.

275
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,240
What do you want?

276
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,760
And now they're practically guaranteeing that they're not going to have any major fan made

277
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,880
content apart from maybe just like something like deadly boss mods, the equivalent of something

278
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,080
like that helper tools, but no like actual full mods.

279
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:20,640
And in my opinion, uh, blizzard, I keep wanting to say blizzard Dota now heroes of the storm

280
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,680
for me was the strongest of all those Dota games.

281
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,920
I prefer it to Dota two and league of legends be quite simply on the basis.

282
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,340
I think it's the easiest one to grab with the least amount of micromanagement going

283
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:38,240
on in the game and the least toxic fans, um, which isn't saying much, but it is at least

284
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,480
from my experience underlined bolded.

285
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Uh, that is what I felt when I played heroes of the storm and it really wasn't until blizzard

286
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:52,280
themselves pretty much pulled it from a trajectory where it was going by saying, Oh, here's the

287
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,720
dorm is done up.

288
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Here's the dorm.

289
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,320
That was the e-sports thing.

290
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Yeah.

291
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,520
So they, they pulled that and they, they scaled way back on heroes of the storm, essentially

292
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,000
saying we're not going to support this on the level that we have been because at the

293
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,480
end of the day, it's not because the game was bad or anything.

294
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,800
It's because I can't make enough money off of the game because I'm a greedy fucking company

295
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,840
and corporation.

296
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:20,080
And that's what it is, is they wanted more money and sorry, sorry, you didn't make more

297
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,380
money.

298
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,380
You know what?

299
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
Too fucking bad.

300
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,180
It just, it just brings me to this kind of like closing thought on this topic, which

301
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,240
is like, what's, what's wrong blizzard?

302
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
What's what's wrong.

303
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
Do you guys need to talk?

304
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Do you need a hug?

305
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,880
Like I, I feel like ever since Mike Morhaime left, it's just been, are you okay?

306
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,160
Are you okay?

307
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
Like honest.

308
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,080
Is this their call for, is it the employee's call for help?

309
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,160
Like the lawyers are like begging for help.

310
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
I don't know.

311
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,360
Like what's going on Bliss?

312
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,200
Like I, I'm at a loss.

313
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,720
I'm legit concerned for things like Diablo four and Overwatch two, which I mean, Overwatch

314
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,160
two has a whole nother controversy going on with that.

315
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,240
And you know, the whole expansion versus new game and all that.

316
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,760
I ain't here to touch that tonight.

317
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
That's a whole nother Oprah.

318
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,000
We can wait until the game is out to discuss that.

319
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You know what it is?

320
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,400
If this was Oprah, we'd have free shit.

321
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,080
You're lucky that they're only charging $60 for an expansion or whatever it is.

322
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:25,260
But the reality is like, I'm losing more and more confidence in blizzard with every time

323
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,480
their name has come up on this program in the last year and a half.

324
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
And I've lost it.

325
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
I know.

326
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
I know.

327
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
I hear you.

328
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
I hear you.

329
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,560
And you know, you're somebody who spent a lot of time and money on world of Warcraft.

330
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,120
I'm somebody who spent a lot of time money on world of Warcraft used to have a blizzard

331
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,720
focused podcast.

332
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,300
I donated all of my paperbacks that I had spent money on.

333
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,040
The only ones I have are my hardcovers.

334
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,400
I only, I think still have my thrall book and like one other, and that's it.

335
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Yeah.

336
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,640
Anyway, looking at some other comments from chat here, and then we'll move on to the next

337
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
topic.

338
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,220
Questbuster in chat says in a weird roundabout way, blizzard didn't have to change their

339
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,980
end user license agreement.

340
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,240
Any ideas that could have been mined from Warcraft three have been mined with Dota

341
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,960
and League of Legends, and any new games might instead take inspiration from those

342
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,620
as opposed to something 17 plus years old, but I guess they need everything.

343
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:22,680
And as that says, Activision wants that dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar.

344
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,760
Anyway, I don't know.

345
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:31,640
Like I just, I hope blizzard can figure out what they're doing wrong and how that's happening

346
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
on a management level.

347
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,320
Cause I know it ain't the frontline employees who work very hard on these visions, it ain't

348
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
them.

349
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
It's coming up.

350
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,800
The call is coming from inside the house and it's probably the biggest boardroom on the

351
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
campus.

352
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,480
It's management decisions that are screwing things up.

353
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:56,100
So I hope to hell blizzard can figure this out or it's going to just be sad trombone

354
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,680
every time their name comes up.

355
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,120
I firmly believe that when people get to the upper management level, they lose touch with

356
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,220
the common sense part of running a company and only look at things like market research

357
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,880
and don't think about how things are actually going to affect players unless you were dealing

358
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,920
only with brand recognition and using the Warcraft name as money.

359
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,480
Other than that, they're out of touch.

360
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,140
How many, how many hours a week do you think executives at video game companies spend playing

361
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,140
the games?

362
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,820
Not at all.

363
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,820
Some of them.

364
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,740
Some of them I would say do.

365
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,500
I would say Phil Spencer, head of X-Box plays a shit ton of X-Box.

366
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
I would say that.

367
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,700
But you, you get that from that guy.

368
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,780
He like how much has X-Box turned around since he took over?

369
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,460
You can tell who has the love.

370
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,460
Yes.

371
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,580
And then you can tell who has the love of money.

372
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,420
Like Don Mattrick who preceded him.

373
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,420
Yeah.

374
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,420
Anyway.

375
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,420
All right.

376
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
Well, let's move on.

377
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,580
What are some of the decisions that came out of Sega toward the end of their console days?

378
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,580
Yeah.

379
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,580
All right.

380
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,580
Let's move on.

381
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,260
Just I, all I can do, Blizzard and executives, I'm just going to send my thoughts and prayers

382
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,300
that you all figure it out.

383
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,180
Which we know just does jack shit.

384
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,180
So.

385
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,100
So this is on you guys to figure out.

386
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
All right.

387
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,700
Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

388
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,220
been playing this week.

389
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,700
And while dark soccer starts her gaming week, I'm going to enjoy one of these cookies.

390
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
Is it a biscuit or is it a cookie?

391
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,380
So I'll hold it up in front of the camera real quick.

392
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,380
I already ate one.

393
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,380
So shut up.

394
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,380
Okay.

395
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,380
So what are they?

396
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,780
So she's holding up Viennese Whirls.

397
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
Ooh, vanilla.

398
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,780
Oh, they're actually.

399
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
They're actually.

400
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,780
Downton Abbey branded.

401
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,540
They're Downton Abbey branded cookies.

402
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,860
And yes, it says $4.99 on the package.

403
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,500
They were 30% off and I bought the fuck out of them.

404
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,260
I hope Judi Dench judges me as I eat one.

405
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
Okay.

406
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,260
Dame Judi Dench.

407
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,540
So I went to the whole reason I went to the world market was because they closed down

408
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,500
the one in Elk Grove.

409
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,340
And that's the only place I can find my Twinning's Lady Grey Tea, which I absolutely love and

410
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,980
I blame Tiara for.

411
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,260
So anyway.

412
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:11,900
I have been playing Animal Crossing in Pokemon Go, really.

413
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,100
I had a smattering of pinball.

414
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,620
You okay there, Rob?

415
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,420
So I had a smattering of pinball going on with this.

416
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:26,380
I've also been back to playing a lot of Patterned, just because I relaunched the game to play

417
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:32,060
it on my Mac and wanted to redo the puzzles and I'm doing all the new puzzles on my phone

418
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,020
as well and when I'm done with that, then I'll cry because I fucking love that game

419
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,500
and they need more puzzles.

420
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,420
I haven't, well, you know, I had that sinus infection and I was still pretty sick this

421
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,980
last week, so every time I was gonna sit down to play something in front of me, I was like,

422
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,300
ah, I'll play this, no I won't, I'll play, no I won't.

423
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:58,540
So it was just a bunch of that and just staring at my phone and playing the shit on there.

424
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,900
And then of course, the stuff that I wanted to play at home today, I could not.

425
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,780
I decided to not be at my house because of the superb owl.

426
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:12,540
So I am avoiding sports ball like it's a plague because it is.

427
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,540
Right now.

428
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,540
Mogi.

429
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,300
I actually played a few things this week.

430
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:24,860
I played Orna some more, so I'm level 122 and I did make it a point to actually play

431
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:31,740
a few other things, so I went back and booted up Minecraft, the Bedrock Edition, because

432
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,380
I was looking at, I'm still looking at doing a Bedrock server, but I wanted to research

433
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:43,420
more on how servers work on the Bedrock Edition, I haven't really done anything like that.

434
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
So I have to look and see.

435
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,900
I still have to figure out if the PlayStation 4 support servers currently, they just got

436
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,940
the Bedrock Edition in December, and I don't know if that was part of it, the server part.

437
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,940
So I'll have to see.

438
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,780
And then the other game, I picked up Deer Simulator, which I haven't played yet, but

439
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,780
that's, it's a really weird.

440
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,940
Is that the game they have at every Walmart?

441
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:09,540
No, this is more like Goat Simulator, just ridiculous, stupid.

442
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,780
I'm thinking of Big Game Hunter, that's Deer Hunter Simulator.

443
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,140
Oops, big difference.

444
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,020
Yes, big difference.

445
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,140
The other game I played, which is also kind of a simulator game, is called the Coin Game,

446
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:30,680
and the Coin Game is basically a first-person arcade patron simulator game.

447
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:37,580
So you go and you play all of the ticket spitter games that you possibly could want to play.

448
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,980
They have all of your favorites there, and then...

449
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,680
Wait, this is Ticket Spitter Simulator.

450
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,420
It's a Ticket Spitter Simulator.

451
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:49,300
So you actually, so what they have right now is basically, it's just, they call it

452
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,660
Birthday Mode.

453
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,140
You start off with $50.

454
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,260
It's really unlimited money, and then you earn money, or tickets, and you get prizes

455
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,260
and stuff like that.

456
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,140
But they're going to have a survival mode that they're building in right now that basically

457
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,580
the way that works is you go, you're your kid, so you have certain hours that you can

458
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,140
be in the arcade and stuff, because you have your curfew and stuff.

459
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:15,820
So you go, you make, you win stuff with these tickets, you get prizes, you take them to

460
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:22,600
a pawn shop, and you pawn them off, and you get money, and it just, it's like, yeah.

461
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,060
And then you have your own house and everything, so you can actually get the prize.

462
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,220
This is kind of part of the game too, right now, is you can actually, any prizes you can

463
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,020
go to your house, you can go put them on your walls and stuff like that, and it's just,

464
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,620
it's ridiculous.

465
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,940
I feel like I want to play a ticket spitter simulator game that's mixed with Five Nights

466
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:45,420
at Freddy's, and so the premise is tickets or death.

467
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,420
Tickets or death?

468
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,780
Yes.

469
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,460
Would you play, Dark Sakura, would you play tickets or death?

470
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,620
I'll have the chicken.

471
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:01,940
Well it is, it is a game that they made in Unity, so I guess you could, you know, potentially

472
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,980
there, but like, I have to say, like, the physics of the games are pretty spot on, if

473
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,620
not a little bit more forgiving, like, I know the claw games, definitely more forgiving,

474
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,460
but it still has that limp claw physics and everything, and they've got, you know, just

475
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,740
like all the, but on top of that though, like, and I haven't really gotten to play through

476
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,820
much of it, but they have multiple arcades you can go to, including the Midway, and not

477
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:30,460
only do they have ticket games there, but they have go-karts, they have laser tag, and

478
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,580
they've got, like, other, like, Oh, this is why you downloaded it.

479
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,020
It's the virtual laser tag part of ticket or die.

480
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:42,980
It just, it looks, it looked really fun, just to mess around with, so yeah, the coin game

481
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:50,340
is fun messing around with that, but, yeah, so that's what I played this week.

482
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,860
For my gaming week, I was traveling out of town a few days for work this week, so that

483
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,980
kind of cut into my gaming time, although I did bring my Switch, so at the hotel I was

484
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,660
able to play a little bit of Pokémon Shield and work on my Pokédex a little bit, and

485
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,060
I was playing some of the classic Super Nintendo archive stuff, so playing some Super Metroid

486
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,820
and some A Link to the Past, just a little bit, and a little more Sayonara Wild Hearts

487
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,060
too, just because I was randomly thinking about that game, and I was like, I shall play

488
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,180
this game.

489
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:22,500
When I was at home, still continuing on Final Fantasy XIV, my friends made me, because I

490
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,420
was really resistant for a long time to do the new 24-man raid, the copied factory, which

491
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:33,180
is the one that's inspired by Nier, so I really kind of just didn't want to do it,

492
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:39,540
because sometimes those new raids, they're just a mess, and you wipe a bunch, and it's

493
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:44,180
like, so much time to get through, but it didn't end up being that bad, I guess.

494
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,660
It was fine, but I was also kind of like, okay, we got through it.

495
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:53,420
The music was really good, and it was a really pretty kind of raid, but then I was also kind

496
00:27:53,420 --> 00:28:00,300
of like, okay, you guys were hyping that up a lot, and the music was really good, though,

497
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,300
I will say that.

498
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,620
The music was really great, especially in that last fight that you do in the copied

499
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,060
factory, so I did finally go through that, and I've just been working on random stuff

500
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:14,940
in Final Fantasy XIV, so yay for MMOs, and yay for continued adventures in No Man's Sky.

501
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,420
I've still been playing that.

502
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,340
I've probably played more No Man's Sky this time around than any other time I've revisited

503
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,060
the game, because you know every nine months or so I end up, ooh, what's new in No Man's

504
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,060
Sky?

505
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,060
Let's go visit it.

506
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,220
I was visiting my Steam library, and I noticed I did not have No Man's Sky installed on my

507
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,220
computer, so I did that, but I've yet to go back and actually play it.

508
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,220
All right.

509
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:44,300
Okay, well, if that's it for our gaming weeks, then we will move on and get into some more

510
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,220
stories for tonight.

511
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,000
Just housekeeping, we're in February now, right?

512
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,760
So there's not going to be a live show, actually it would be March 1st, but I'm hoping we can

513
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,080
tape something in a bit, because I'm going to be gone March 1st and March 8th.

514
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,200
I've mentioned this on the show before, but I'm going off with the Starboard Power Coupling

515
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,280
Kids onto the Star Trek Cruise.

516
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,400
I'm very excited about it.

517
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,600
I actually think one of those days I had a sistery thing to do anyway, so.

518
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,040
Okay, well, then I guess that works out, so yeah.

519
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,800
So March 1st and March 8th, no live shows, although Bobby Black Wolf will be here, and

520
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,040
I'm hoping we will have at least for one of those weeks something ready to go, because

521
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,280
you know I hate going two weeks, I hate going one week missing a show, but I really hate

522
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
going two weeks, so.

523
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,200
Well, I'm also going to say that I'm going to be doing a gaming-related thing in April.

524
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,240
I mean, it's not going to affect the show, but I'd like, I will be talking about it,

525
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,480
is that our local leather bar, The Bolt, has gamer night every third Friday.

526
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,000
I've been, I went to one of the first ones, and I got to be on it.

527
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,400
I hope maybe they've learned, because when I went, all it was was that on the TVs they

528
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,560
were playing Smash Brothers, and I was kind of like, this is, hopefully they've added

529
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
on it.

530
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
April's is going to be classic games.

531
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Oh, fun.

532
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,560
So I will be there in face as a sister, but I will gladly also report on it for the show.

533
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
I want to go!

534
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,720
Yeah, go, well, it's also my friend's birthday.

535
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
I have to mention-

536
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,720
You want to go to the leather daddy bar with us?

537
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Not really.

538
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,680
Well, not that I could, hey, I'm sure that'd be fun, but I just, I don't think I get the

539
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,680
time.

540
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
I get it.

541
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
Yeah.

542
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,320
Um, so I wanted to mention, and I don't remember if I mentioned this last week or before, but

543
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,720
like there's this 80s cafe that's over-

544
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,720
Oh, the one in Rancho.

545
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Yeah.

546
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Yeah, yeah, I know that place.

547
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,240
So they've got like, um, arcade games in there as well, and plus you can pay like a buck

548
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,440
and they have like console games set up and everything.

549
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Oh, I did not.

550
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,840
And they have, uh, the servers are dressed up as well in costume, so they have one guy

551
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,260
that's dressed up like Ernest P. Worrell, and, uh, who's the other guy?

552
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,760
Is that the guy from the Ernst films?

553
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
Yes.

554
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Oh my God.

555
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
Hey, Vern.

556
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
Yeah, exactly.

557
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,760
So-

558
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Yeah, he died.

559
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
I-

560
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
That's great.

561
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
Yeah.

562
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:59,800
Um, Azette is saying that I got a Pokestop added there.

563
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,080
So if you, if you have spun the Pokestop at the 80s cafe, thank Azette.

564
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,200
But yeah, it's definitely worth checking out because the, their food looks pretty good

565
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
too.

566
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
They have a Cap'n Crunch milkshake.

567
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
I should have.

568
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Damn it.

569
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,040
That's where I was going to go for Sunday for dinner.

570
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,680
I was like thinking, I'm like, there's a place I was going to go to stop.

571
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,680
I'm like, where was it?

572
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
I can't think of it.

573
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,600
So I ended up getting a sandwich thing.

574
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Damn it.

575
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Damn it.

576
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Damn it.

577
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Damn it.

578
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
All right.

579
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
As it says Tetris Tots.

580
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Right.

581
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
Well, okay.

582
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Oh, it's Tetris Tots.

583
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
All right.

584
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,700
I will, we will, uh, go, go forth into the community, uh, while we have a couple of weeks

585
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,080
of no live show and bring back some reports.

586
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,160
But I know I actually don't own anything leather except for a belt and some shoes.

587
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,600
I need, I, I, I don't either, but Alan does, and we're not going to talk about that on

588
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,040
my live internet podcast.

589
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:54,480
Well, I'm, I'm just saying that I would feel that maybe I'll have to like do like at least

590
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,640
like my wimple or something, you know, but at any rate, um, you know, it's also though

591
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,880
my friend's birthday and two days before my birthday.

592
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,880
So, okay.

593
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
That'd be fun.

594
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Yeah.

595
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
All right.

596
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Sounds good.

597
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
All right.

598
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,560
Um, I guess we can move on then.

599
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,920
Let's talk about, let's get into some gaming news and, uh, some of the stories from the

600
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
week.

601
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
So, uh, Loki, I think we'll start with you.

602
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
Yes.

603
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:23,400
But speaking of pokey stops, sort of speaking of leather daddies, um, uh, Pokemon home is

604
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,000
a brand new service that they're going to try to, um, milk some more money out of you.

605
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,800
Uh, because Hey, you know how you're paying for Nintendo online.

606
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,960
That's not online enough for Pokemon.

607
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,040
We need some more money because storing those Pokemon is hard.

608
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:46,880
And so, um, they have, they will have a basic service, which is free, or you can get the

609
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:53,480
premium service, which is $3 a month or $16 a year.

610
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,120
And uh, so basically the way it goes, um, this is going to be kind of replacing the

611
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,400
old Pokemon bank.

612
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,720
If you get the basic service, um, you can, I guess deposit three 30 Pokemon.

613
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:14,280
Uh, you can place three of them in the wonder box at one time, which I don't know how that

614
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
works.

615
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,520
I don't know if that's like you put something in and hope you get something good out of

616
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
that.

617
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:26,440
Um, and then of course they have, um, one Pokemon that you could put in the GTS at once.

618
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:32,880
They in order to trade, um, you can participate in room trades and then they have the judge

619
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,040
functions unavailable platinum.

620
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:41,200
It jumps up quite a bit so you can move Pokemon from the Pokemon bank.

621
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:50,240
Um, with that you can get up store up to 6,000 Pokemon, 30 and 6,000 seems quite the jump.

622
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,800
Um, you can put 10 Pokemon in the wonder box at once.

623
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,480
Three Pokemon can place in GTS.

624
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,000
Um, you can participate and host room trades.

625
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,360
You want to go to the wonder box, little Pikachu?

626
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,400
You want to go to the wonder box?

627
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
What's the wonder box?

628
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
I don't know.

629
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,640
The wonder box sounds like you get to drink from the fire hose.

630
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
Yes.

631
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,640
That's what it sounds like.

632
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,640
Uh, yes.

633
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:23,400
Um, I don't know, but I do know like there were, they had a, and it's not in this article,

634
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,760
but they have like a diagram talking about how.

635
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
Thank you.

636
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
Fifth dream.

637
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
Wonder box equals trading.

638
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,760
They, I knew some, if is Shane not here tonight, he must actually be watching the super bowl

639
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
or something.

640
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,760
Fifth dream's helping us out.

641
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
Wonder box equals trading.

642
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:41,320
Um, so they have like a diagram because apparently the way you can move Pokemon through this,

643
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,480
and I think this works with Pokemon go as well, is they can only go in certain directions.

644
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,320
So like for example, with, there's a fucking diagram about like how this, the, the square

645
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,760
peg can go in this square hole, but not this round hole.

646
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,760
And Pikachu from here can go there, but Pikachu, once he's there, can't go back.

647
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,560
So you better make sure like it's, it's fucking complicated.

648
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,560
Yes.

649
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,560
Yeah.

650
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,880
On one hand, I kind of get it and I give him a pass because you know, we're talking about

651
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,120
Pokemon the day, all the way back to the game boy from 1990 and technologies have changed

652
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,120
quite a bit.

653
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,560
And then you have the complication of you have that old, old game, but then we had the

654
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,360
virtual console versions of those games that would allow you to put things into the Pokemon

655
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
bank.

656
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:29,360
But now I don't know how home changes that is Pokemon home going to be on three D S because

657
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,640
home is probably not going to be a three D S and Pokemon home is replacing Pokemon bank.

658
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,120
And only if you get premium, can you move this Pokemon from Pokemon bank to Pokemon

659
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
home?

660
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,800
Well, all right then I can tell you that that sounds like a whole bunch of bullshit that

661
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,160
I don't want to mess with.

662
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,120
Well, I mean they were, I mean it's cloud storage or whatever, but it's not a lot like

663
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:57,640
it. I'm not how much storage really is it's going to cost. I'm not going to defend the

664
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,880
high price tag, but I'm going to be like, if they want to charge a couple bucks, then

665
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,200
fine. You know, it is an ongoing service and servers aren't free, but it's a little high

666
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,780
for what you're really getting.

667
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:16,680
I want to say that like, this is about three times as expensive as Pokemon bank was. I

668
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,560
don't remember, but I know this is several times more expensive than it was before with

669
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,920
not as many features I would imagine.

670
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,920
All right. Well, I don't know. I'll probably still check it out. Oh, sorry. Yes. I'm being

671
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
corrected by chat.

672
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
1996, not 1998.

673
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,320
Yeah, but I had said the Game Boy dates back to 1990, which it does, but you guys are right.

674
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:45,160
Pokemon was like, Pokemon was a very late Game Boy game. It was right on the cusp of

675
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,560
the Game Boy color because I remember Pokemon yellow was like a Game Boy color game basically.

676
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,000
Cause I had a Game Boy color that was a little Pikachu. And when you turned it on, you remember

677
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,180
how the power light was red? It was one of Pikachu's cheeks. It was really cute. Anyway,

678
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,760
that's how, that's how Pokemon gets away with it low key. Cause it's cute because you all

679
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
suckers.

680
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,040
All right. Uh, speaking of being suckers, uh, I'm a sucker for Pokemon go. I know that

681
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,800
game is a whole lot of fun and Pokemon go road rolled out some big new features this

682
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,380
week, including the go battle league, which means you can, uh, actually start to fight

683
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,360
other trainers and not just like three star friends or more on your list. You can actually

684
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:30,460
fight randos, uh, and you get some rewards for, uh, winning certain battles and you have

685
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:35,560
a rank that you can slowly increase and so forth. So, uh, we're in preseason leagues

686
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,040
right now and the great league battles are going on right now. I've been playing it a

687
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:46,120
little bit. Have you? Um, I did too. I must confess, I hate this feature. I, I hate it.

688
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:51,440
I don't, but I'm not a big fan of PVP in the Pokemon games. That's never really been it

689
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,920
for me. Uh, and let's be real. The battle in Pokemon go is not what it is in the mainline

690
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:03,280
Pokemon games. It's very different. Um, and I like it. I'm just from, from that, I like

691
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,480
the raids. I like the PVE. This is another case of I'm totally fine with PVE, but I'm

692
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,700
feeling forced into PVP that I don't want to do. Why am I feeling forced? Because there's

693
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:21,680
rewards and they're gated behind wins. And some of those rewards happen to be other Pokemon

694
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,020
that are new into the game. So you can only get them right now anyway, through winning

695
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:32,580
battles in this league. And I hate it to be honest. It's just, they're not that fun

696
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:37,660
to me. Um, the raids are completely different because you can turn that into a social thing.

697
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:42,180
I like meeting my ingress friends at the park and taking on a three or four star raid, whatever's

698
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:47,020
there, maybe a five star, depending on what it is, that is fine. Uh, being forced or feeling

699
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:52,060
like I'm forced to do PVP to unlock certain Pokemon is not fine. And son of a bitch, I'm

700
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,140
just realizing I never did spin a stop for that fucking quest day that was today. So

701
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,940
I was busy doing other stuff this afternoon. It's another new Pokemon that was only out

702
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,300
between like two and five o'clock today, the day of the super bowl, they decided to do,

703
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:12,300
um, this brilliant. Yeah, I know. Right. I'm hearing that that Pokemon will be an eggs.

704
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,300
So it's not that it's gone forever, but it's just one of those. Let me just irritating.

705
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:21,020
But, um, well, at the very least I got my shiny Magikarp today so I can finally have

706
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:27,240
a red Gyarados. Hmm. Uh, I'm curious too about the, uh, Pokemon community day vote. Cause

707
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,540
that was something that was going on yesterday. There's so much shit that goes on in Pokemon

708
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,820
go now, which is fine. I mean, I do applaud. And even though I hate this battle system,

709
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,260
um, I do applaud that at least it's a pretty major thing that they've added to the game.

710
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,820
So at least Niantic and the developers are continuing to enhance the game and that part's

711
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,220
kind of cool, but, uh, I just like it cause I've steamrolled over everybody. I guess I

712
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:54,780
did, I won a battle and then I lost too. So I was like, whatever. Uh, SG100 Matt says,

713
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,640
I'm doing the battling for the rewards. I'm kind of with Rob on this. The PVP doesn't

714
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,580
enhance the game for me, especially in its current battle form. And as that says what

715
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:08,820
I did it and Rob didn't delete the quest. Uh, if you got an extra one of those things,

716
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:14,660
trade me please. Cause I didn't get one. I'm sure. I'm sure other people I know went and

717
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:21,380
got like 18 shinies of whatever it was. What was the Pokemon they gave out today? I don't

718
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,380
remember some mousy Pokemon that I didn't end up getting. I was trying to show my 37

719
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,540
Magikarp. Are you near a nest or something? Or did you just unlock so many of them out

720
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:36,180
here? Like everywhere I go, Magikarp. It's um, because it ties into the Valentine's event,

721
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,900
which is almost over. I think I finally got my shiny, so I'm happy, but whatever. I'm

722
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,260
sorry. I take that back. It's not the Valentine's event. It's the year of the re it's the lunar

723
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:50,940
new year event. So is it also then the year of the unnecessary stupid fish? Well, you

724
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:56,700
know how like red is good luck. So what they're doing is they up the spawns of red or red

725
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:03,060
adjacent Pokemon. Now, even though Magikarp is orange, shiny Magikarp turns into red Gyarados.

726
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:08,180
So that's why you're seeing more Magikarp is because of the red Gyarados stretch, but

727
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,980
okay, it's a little bit of a stretch, but whatever. I mean, it's better than a ton of

728
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,700
those love discs because what the hell am I going to do with those? I like the events

729
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,980
that shake up the meta of the usual spawns, so I'm not going to complain about all the

730
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:26,180
Magikarp. The other one I'm seeing a ton of, um, the new, the crab things, the crab, the

731
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:31,580
core fish, uh, the food Gus, one of the new ones. Yeah. Which I like that fungus turns

732
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:36,180
into among us. Yeah. Cause there's a fungus among us. Thank you. SSU and Hunter Matt mini

733
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:41,380
Shino was the special Pokemon today. Thank you. So that's, that's the one that I didn't

734
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,900
bother to get, but just at some point I'll go visit Shane and I know he has like 20 shinies

735
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,380
already. I'm sure. And I would think if they were going to do pretty stuff, I would have

736
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:57,180
like your special quest one to be a melodic or something. Cause they're so pretty. Oh,

737
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:02,280
well, uh, there's going to be plenty more, uh, plenty more events coming to Pokemon go

738
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,160
in the future as well. I know they're setting up a legendary pretty soon. What's also interesting

739
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,240
about the battle thing is that you can either just pay coins to unlock more battles, right?

740
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:17,040
Money, money, money. But the other interesting way to unlock is walking five kilometers.

741
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,400
So if you walk five kilometers, you can also, which isn't that hard to do, especially if

742
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,960
you know, you're following the good guidelines of getting out, walking every day. Uh, and

743
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,340
you have an adventure sync enabled device, which pretty much any Apple phone at this

744
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,760
point has that it's now in Harry Potter and even, yeah. And now Harry Potter woo has it

745
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,040
too. And I've been making use out of that in that game for sure as well. So, um, yeah,

746
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,800
that's great. So anyhow, uh, at least, you know, even if this feature is not my cup of

747
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:52,000
tea, I am also very happy to hear that they're still developing a lot of shit for Pokemon

748
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,680
go. So that's pretty cool. Uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, I also didn't do the event.

749
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,160
My girlfriend traded me a bunch of hers. Well, that was, that was very nice of your girlfriend

750
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:06,240
to do. All right, well, let's move on. Dark Sakura, less Pokemon, more, uh, horror movies.

751
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:12,720
I also just realized I had like 18 ratatas. Time to send them to the blender. Uh, the

752
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,280
professor can deal with all this vermin. Anyway. Um, okay. So I have made no secret that I

753
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,600
love the silent Hill movie. I love Christoph Ganz for doing it. I even liked the crappy

754
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:29,120
sequel. It wasn't great, but it was silent Hill three. And that made me happy at any

755
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:35,120
rate. Um, there is a quote now from Christoph Ganz, um, where he was talking about his current

756
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:41,520
projects, um, during a, uh, interview with a French film site called Allocin. And I'm

757
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,360
just going to read the, um, the quote because it brings up more than one thing. I have two

758
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:53,000
horror film projects with Victor Hadida. I'm working on the adaptation of video game project

759
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,200
zero and which was fatal frame over here. Uh, the film will take place in Japan. I especially

760
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,080
don't want to uproot the game from its Japanese haunted house setting. And we're also working

761
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:07,400
on a new silent Hill. The project will always be anchored in this atmosphere of a small

762
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,760
American town ravaged by Puritanism. I think it's time to make a new one. One of the other

763
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,680
things that goes on to say is that his favorite silent Hill character though was James Sunderland,

764
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,780
who was the, uh, protagonist of silent Hill two. So maybe we'll get something actually

765
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,960
related to him. That would be kind of cool. Although I really did like the vibe of the

766
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,680
first one with following, um, you know, the themes of motherhood going on through it.

767
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:39,080
Um, I never noticed too in the first movie that all of the characters were women except

768
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:44,440
for Sean Bean in the, but he was like, he never went to silent Hill in the first move

769
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,020
in the male characters did. Yeah, exactly. So all of the characters that were in silent

770
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:54,240
Hill were women. I never noticed that until it was pointed out. I think that some of the

771
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,620
church people might've been, but all of the main characters, I'll have to double check

772
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:07,200
it. But, um, and the only other male characters that were within silent Hill were, uh, portrayed

773
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,560
as male, like the red pyramid and the janitor. I kind of red pyramid kind of struck me as

774
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,160
a genderless kind of thing though. I mean, maybe I'm just, I don't know. Well, not in

775
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,840
the games. Yeah, I guess that's true. But, but the, the fact that even those two were

776
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:30,200
played by, by men in that universe, and one of them was supposed to have been the janitor

777
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:35,380
that affected Alyssa or assaulted, I should've said. And then the other one was of course

778
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:41,680
the red pyramid. So another thing to throw in there. Uh, as that points out, the little

779
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,760
girl is in dark matter, which rocks. Oh, cool. So, yeah. So, uh, that's cool that we get

780
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,600
the, uh, silent Hill movie that that's going to continue on. And, uh, Chris, Chris off

781
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,140
guns doing that as good because you can do fatal frame weld as well. Yeah. I'd be curious

782
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,300
about a fatal frame. You know, the other thing that kind of strikes me as funky though about

783
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,560
this news. Um, you know, I mean, it's cool that we're getting, you know, more video game

784
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,960
movies of things we're into, but I'm really surprised with how freaking well the Witcher

785
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:14,200
did on Netflix. Now I know the Witcher was books, but let's be real game. The games help

786
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,000
there are three games. Yeah. So I'm kind of surprised we're not talking TV shows at

787
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,720
this point. Like I'm surprised we're not talking about what video games are Hulu looking at

788
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:29,640
and Amazon prime and the other, cause we also know that I'm the same company optioned final

789
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:36,680
fantasy 14 that made the Witcher. So we don't know what they're doing with it yet, but obviously

790
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,520
as a fan of 14, I'm really intrigued. Um, but I'm just surprised in general, we're not

791
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:47,280
talking about more video games becoming television series. Um, like there's fan wake every other

792
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,240
month about the legend is Zelda becoming a Netflix series of some sort. And I'm kind

793
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,800
of surprised we're not like, you know, with how well again, the Witcher is done. We're

794
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,440
not kind of talking about that or something like, can you imagine if the elder scrolls

795
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,120
became a TV series? I mean, the elder scrolls seems like something that's perfect for that

796
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:09,360
sort of thing, but maybe it's too much high fantasy. Maybe that would be too much. Like

797
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,520
if, uh, you could just cause the Witcher, it seems like the Witcher is doing very well.

798
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,320
Well, for two reasons, the Witcher is doing very well because number one, Henry Cavill

799
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:25,360
is nice to look at attractive in that show. Uh, and then number two, uh, the Witcher is

800
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:30,320
doing well because it's filling a void for many people left by game of Thrones, especially

801
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,880
the subpar last season of game of Thrones. I'm hearing that people are checking out the

802
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,480
Witcher because it's a lot of the same type of like high fantasy that, you know, the game

803
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,480
of Thrones delivered. So yeah, kind of interesting. There's another quote in here that I really

804
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,880
like, cause it's how I feel about the first movie, um, about back to silent Hill that

805
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,920
guns considers it to be a viewed, a beautiful memory. And he had a great sense of satisfaction

806
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:58,160
when it was released. Fifth dream today says Mandalorian mean means a mass effect show.

807
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,440
Can you imagine a mass effect TV show? I just, I don't want them to do it cause they wouldn't

808
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:09,040
get it right. I did. I did just finish the Mandalorian. That was a great TV show. That

809
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:15,600
was like a very well done step aside for just a second about the Mandalorian. I had a lot of

810
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,480
Firefly vibes for it, for it being the space Western and having some of that same little

811
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,200
quirkiness thrown in amongst the seriousness. I really had such a good feeling from that show.

812
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,040
I still haven't watched Mandalorian. I'm like, I'm so uncool girl. Wow. You know,

813
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,880
did you finish the good place? No, I sure haven't. I'm more like halfway through season three. No,

814
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,680
everybody is talking about how, like I w you know, most TV finales, people are like,

815
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,400
Meh, but I have not heard a single bad thing about the good place finale. No spoilers,

816
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:48,480
no spoilers, but everybody is saying it's perfect that it ended very well. And that there will like

817
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,920
never be another show like it pretty much, pretty much. Yeah. I'm so curious. So, all right.

818
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,360
Anyhow. All right. Well, until then let's move on. So one thing, uh, I know I will not be,

819
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,800
playing or watching the good place on is a brand new switch, right?

820
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,920
Well, you're probably not gonna be watching on the switch anyway. So I don't think they

821
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,560
really have a lot of Hulu. Oh yeah. And I guess Netflix a little bit, but, uh,

822
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:16,000
Netflix, uh, YouTube and Hulu, they do not have Netflix on the switch. No, that's a,

823
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,120
that's a sore spot right now. Yeah. Really? Yeah. I swear it. Maybe I'm thinking of the Wii U.

824
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,360
You know what? Random, but you know, it was really cool. And I got to give props to this,

825
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,720
cause I was at a hotel, I was at a Hyatt hotel, uh, for work this week. And, um, I brought my

826
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,840
switch dock and my switch to plug into the TV, which was really easy to do because they put

827
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,600
HDMI ports on the side of the TV. Now they realize that people want to plug in their own shits. They

828
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,200
do, but all these TVs they have in the hotel now have Chromecast built in. So I wanted to watch

829
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,680
Star Trek Picard because I hadn't seen that yet. Right? Well, all I had to do, I just went onto

830
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,080
the phone and paired it and then that, uh, my CBS all access, just cause there's, you know,

831
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,000
there's no app on the TV for CBS all access, but there isn't a phone. I was able to just play Star

832
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,880
Trek card on the TV and catch up on what I'd missed, which was awesome. Cool. Yeah. Anyway,

833
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,280
sorry for the random tangent, but I just, it was one of those, I love technology and I love when

834
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:13,600
the hotels like are actually current on technology. That was a really good feeling. So anyways, um,

835
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:20,400
apparently they said despite the rumors that there was going to be some sort of fancier pro version

836
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:28,320
of the switch coming out. Um, they have their latest financial report from Nintendo basically

837
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:33,760
said, please note, we have no plans to launch a new Nintendo switch model during 2020.

838
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,880
I'm really glad they gave this heads up. Honestly. I just think it's not coming in 2020,

839
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,240
but it'll be 2021. Oh no. Sure. Of course. Of course, Loki. But I'm glad that they kind of

840
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,760
put to bed the talks of, oh boy, now I'm going to have to buy a PlayStation five and a switch pro

841
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:59,280
this year. I think Nintendo was smart to maybe back off a little bit and instead do the, um,

842
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,680
you know, the, the, the switch in a year where they're not launching new consoles from, from

843
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:09,920
PlayStation and X-Box. So, um, good. Yeah. And it's, it's not like the current switch is bad

844
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,800
by any means. And some people really love that switch light. So they've got plenty right now.

845
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,320
So they're going to wait a little longer on the switch pro, and I think that's fine.

846
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,840
So, and now I don't have to worry about buying three new consoles this year.

847
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,720
And I wasn't really worried about it anyways, but like, I don't know,

848
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,520
can we fix the analog six on the controllers, please? Uh, fifth dream today says what? No

849
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,480
two screen switch. Damn. I don't, I don't know if the switch is going to go to screen. I just

850
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,200
don't really see that happening. I would, if they wanted to emulate DS or 3DS games,

851
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,600
all you would have to do is tilt the existing switch on its side and have a black line in the

852
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:51,920
middle. Like if they wanted to do 3DS or regular DS games, they could, uh, hello clubhouse games

853
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:58,320
returning on switch. Wouldn't that be nice? Um, pod culture believes the switch light is awesomer

854
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:02,400
and it just, it just depends on your preference. Like if you pretty much only play the switch in

855
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,000
undocked mode, then yeah, the switch light's probably going to be better for you. I prefer

856
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,360
to play in docked mode, but I also realize I'm, there's more people in the other camp than me.

857
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,880
That's how I play. Yeah, I know. I know. It's how a lot of people tell me they play,

858
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,360
but I prefer the dock mode. So, all right, well, let's move on. I was just talking about hotels

859
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:24,480
a minute ago. Funny enough. Uh, we have a story about, and I'm kind of, this is just not the

860
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,520
business I expected this company to get into, but I guess, um, wherever they can actually make a

861
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:37,360
dime, they'll do it. It's Atari. Atari is investing in the hotel business. And as much as I would want

862
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,200
to point and laugh, because ha ha Atari has not made a lot of great decisions in the last few

863
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:47,600
years. And let's be real that VCS is going to be a gigantic flop. Like, sorry, I'm sorry to sound so

864
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:54,240
rude. Uh, and like, I'm not even giving the thing a chance, but, um, why should I like, there's no

865
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,800
reason to give the Atari VCS a chance. It's, it's likely going to fly. Is anybody buying an Atari

866
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,960
VCS in chat? Anybody? So it's interesting to hear about Atari getting into other industries

867
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:10,240
based on their nostalgia. I was just talking to friends about this recently and the kind of the

868
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,840
question came up that was like, how is Atari even still around? Like, what has Atari really done?

869
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:23,200
And I'm like, Atari is still around on the strength of their catalog. It's like that one

870
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:29,920
hit wonder that wrote a song like 30 years ago that they still play on the radio. Like quick,

871
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:37,200
can you name the last Simple Minds album? Don't you forget about it. Exactly. You know what?

872
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,440
Simple Minds never has to write another hit because Don't You Forget About Me,

873
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,120
which actually was written for Billy Idol. I don't even think they wrote it. Um,

874
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:53,200
it, the money they make off that song, you probably retire off it. You know,

875
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,120
when you got a song that big, I'm trying to think of other like gigantic one hit wonders

876
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,040
that still get played on the radio to this day. Well, I mean, there's always take on me,

877
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:08,080
but Wham was really huge in Europe. You mean, you mean aha. Uh huh. It made it funnier. Don't worry.

878
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:16,800
Well, I mean, Wham did, did better things when it split up. Yeah, for sure. So anyway,

879
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:24,960
um, excuse me, uh, Pixel Pacas says, I don't want the VCS. I do want the Intellivision Amico though.

880
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,040
Well, but Intellivision, we all know is doing their own completely different thing. And,

881
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,560
and this ain't about that, but I do agree with you to that extent, Pixel Pacas.

882
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:42,080
That actually reminded me of one little thing. I did get a new Atari 7800 game. Oh, what's that?

883
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:47,520
I got a baby Pac-Man. I didn't even know they made that on the 7800. They didn't.

884
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,840
It's a, I think it was either a prototype that someone finished. Gotcha. But I'm just saying,

885
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:59,520
I have Atari stuff and I have a baby Pac-Man in my house that is not as good as the real thing,

886
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,320
but pretty good. Okay. Sorry. I got in a coughing fit there and Jamie brought that up to help me

887
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:10,000
out here. So let's go back to talking about Atari. So Atari is getting into the hotel industry since

888
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,080
Atari's strength and the point I was trying to make is that a lot of the money they are

889
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:19,360
still making is off their back catalog and the strength of, you know, Atari retro. And I love

890
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:23,280
Atari retro. I have that fricking Atari hoodie that I love so much that actually looks like the

891
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,120
wood paneling. Pretty much it's in every other selfie I've ever taken to myself because I love

892
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:33,200
that fucking hoodie. Anyhow, Atari is going to try to mix this nostalgia people love about them

893
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:39,600
and mix it with the hospitality entry industry. So the company has signed a contract that will

894
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:46,320
have the Atari licensed name and branding in line with a real estate developer who is building

895
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:52,560
eight hotels in the US. Phoenix will be the home of the first Atari hotel, but there will also be

896
00:55:52,560 --> 00:56:00,560
hotels in Austin, Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas. Does that mean an Atari casino too? Interesting.

897
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:06,800
That would be rad. That would be rad actually. San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle. So there'll

898
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:12,160
be some not far from here because San Francisco and San Jose aren't far. Nifty 805 though is like

899
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,120
how I feel about it. I don't want an Atari themed hotel. I need a gamer X. How about a gamer X at

900
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:23,840
the Atari hotel? Okay, I can deal with that. Okay. See, porque no los dos. Anyway, um, now we should

901
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:29,440
have a uh, a Chuck E Cheese hotel since, you know, we're throwing nostalgia stuff. Everyone can have

902
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:36,400
a hotel now. Now what's the Coleco doing nowadays? You get a hotel and you get a hotel. Here's what

903
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:42,080
might surprise you about. So it's not just a hotel with the Atari logo on it. They are trying

904
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:47,440
to theme these a little bit. So what are they going to do with the Atari hotels? Esports studios.

905
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:53,280
We don't know any more than just that, that there will be Esports studios, but I mean, okay, you go

906
00:56:53,280 --> 00:57:00,000
to any hotel. They have ballrooms, meeting room, conference rooms. So branding one of these rooms

907
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,320
as an Esports studio. Okay. It makes sense, right? I'm kind of into it. I'm very curious.

908
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:13,600
There will also be an Atari gaming playground at every Atari hotel. The playgrounds, we don't know

909
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,520
again what that is besides the name, but speculation is that it could be like lounges for

910
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:23,360
guests. Maybe it'll have some gaming PCs in there. And then of course, pool, gym, restaurants, bars,

911
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:30,000
bakeries, movie theaters in every building as well. So kind of interesting. Atari is simply

912
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,960
licensed. They will not have any direct hand in the design of the hotels or what the hotels will

913
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:44,560
feature. Probably a good thing considering the VCS. Atari will receive 5% of the hotel revenues.

914
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:51,520
They got an advance of $600,000 for licensing the brand to the developer. That is pretty rad.

915
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:57,600
So I have to admit, I'm intrigued because it doesn't just sound like a different direction

916
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:05,600
for Atari. It sounds like a hotel that's being built with a very specific generation in mind,

917
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:11,840
namely the generation we're pretty much all in. That kind of the blurred line of Gen X and

918
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:17,600
millennials, right? I've heard it called Zillennials, right? That blended term? Zennials.

919
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,720
Zennials. Thank you. I've heard it called, and I love this name. Have you ever heard it called

920
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,960
the Oregon Trail Generation? Because I've heard it called that, and I think that's perfect.

921
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:31,680
So the gap between Gen X and millennials is the Oregon Trail Generation. Perfect. So it sounds

922
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:37,520
like these hotels are kind of like a new thought of how to make a hotel appealing to a different

923
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:43,680
crowd. And honestly, with the minute you guys said an Atari themed casino, potentially, assuming

924
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,480
they're building one in Vegas, that sounds kind of awesome. I'd visit, wouldn't you guys?

925
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:54,960
Yeah. Especially, well, especially if they do have, don't sound too excited, especially if they

926
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:01,520
have the classic gaming stuff. When I go up to Reno, I like to go to Pepper Mill because they

927
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,640
have the- That's always where Dan stays when work takes him to Reno.

928
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,120
Right? Because they have the classic games in the arcade.

929
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,800
And all that pinball. Yeah. It's gotten a little weaker over the years,

930
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,880
but it's still the strongest thing they have in Reno as far as classics go. So imagine if

931
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,800
Atari were to milk that with these classic game spaces, like classic game arcades,

932
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,960
fuck yeah. I'd totally be into that. And that's something that all ages can really enjoy.

933
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,760
So, oh, I think it's cool. Arcade games in all the rooms.

934
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,320
Yeah. Well, maybe. An Atari VCS in every room. Yay.

935
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:42,640
Okay. Let's see. Sia Tabiri says, my new term learned this week. We are boomers.

936
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:51,760
People who insist anime was best before 2000. That doesn't necessarily make sense.

937
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,040
Are you a weaboomer, Dark Sakura?

938
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,000
Personally, my favorite anime came out before I was born. So I mean,

939
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,080
I'm not the right one to talk about that. I mean, keep in mind, my favorite-

940
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,840
Okay, weaboomer. My favorite anime is Science Ninja

941
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,800
Team Gatchaman. And you want to know who's responsible for that, right?

942
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,800
Yoshitaka Amano.

943
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:20,000
All right. Well, at least I think you're not alone in loving your Gatchaman.

944
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:28,640
And DJ Rama S in chat says 1996 to 2010, when anime was the best. Okay, weaboomer. All right.

945
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,640
Come on, though. That was when we had, well, actually a little bit earlier than that,

946
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:39,040
we had Samurai Troopers, which was Ronin Warriors over here. We had Dragon Ball Z,

947
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:43,360
if you want to talk about the good stuff, that everyone got into. Ranma we had.

948
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,400
What else? There was also Cowboy Bebop. There was Evangelion. That was really kind of like

949
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,040
the golden age of modern anime. So I'm going to say-

950
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:59,440
Okay, estrogen100Matt about the Atari Hotel says, I'd check it out, but I would like to see it

951
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:04,560
built. Projects like this tend to fall apart before a shovel has hit the ground. Disney tried

952
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:09,920
this similar thing years ago, not a hotel, but game centers. Very, very good point. Let's not

953
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,760
get too ahead of ourselves until they actually put one up. Fall apart before it's even built.

954
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,160
That sounds just like the VCS. That sounds just like an Atari thing to happen. But remember,

955
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:24,320
Atari just licensed out their name, so we'll see what happens. All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

956
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:27,520
We're going to take a trip down memory lane. I know it's a little earlier in the show than

957
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,400
we usually do it, but Dark Sakura is going to have to leave a little early tonight.

958
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,760
Because my work schedule's garbage. So we're going to get to the classic

959
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,640
game of the week. And we're going to take a trip down memory lane and visit a simpler time

960
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:43,840
when there were not Atari themed hotels. In fact, you couldn't even bring your Atari to a hotel.

961
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,040
It was too complicated to hook up. But if you did bring it to a hotel and get it working,

962
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,720
I mean, props for you. I mean, I did used to sneak my nest to a hotel.

963
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:56,160
I brought a Super Nintendo, I think, once to a convention. But anyway,

964
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,360
it's the classic game of the week. And actually, I think what you picked is a little newer than

965
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:03,360
that stuff. Because again, you only have to be 10 years old to be a classic game of the week.

966
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,400
Tonight's pick is probably somewhere around, I guess, maybe 15?

967
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,400
2001.

968
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,480
Okay. Oh, okay. Wow. Almost 20?

969
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,000
Almost 20.

970
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,200
All right. Well, here it is. The classic-

971
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,480
It's still a surprising one.

972
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,120
Yeah. Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game of the week?

973
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:23,760
I picked Zone of the Enders, which I was trying to think of, like, what was some of the last

974
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,480
good stuff that Konami did, right? And Zone of the Enders was pretty fucking amazing,

975
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,960
I think. It was a really good game. I wasn't any good at it, but hey.

976
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,840
And the thing that I liked about it is I really did sort of like this mecha combat

977
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:42,480
style that was going on. I mean, I love- What was the game? Cyber Sled? I love Virtual On.

978
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,880
And this is right up there with it, but just a little bit newer of a vibe.

979
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:57,680
So anyway, it is set in space around Jupiter. And you play as a columnist named Leo Stenbuck.

980
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:04,720
Who is a survivor of a colony after it was attacked. And you control his mecha,

981
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:09,760
which is called an orbital frame called Jehudi. I always mispronounce it because, like I said,

982
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:16,720
I hardly played the game because I wasn't great at it. But it was supposed to be a more realistic

983
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:23,840
take on the mecha genre. The mecha was designed by Shinkawa Youji, who did the mecha design for

984
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:27,920
Metal Gear. So another reason I'm reading this up, it has a lot of ties with the Metal Gear series.

985
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:37,200
And it was, however, criticized for being a short game with poor localization. But the game in

986
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:43,760
general was still overly well received. It did come out on March 21st, 2001 in Japan.

987
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,760
And then in April in North America and Europe, and it came out on the PlayStation 2.

988
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:56,400
There also was quite another bit that was tied into it. We had a spin-off for Game Boy Advance

989
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:03,040
called The Fist of Mars. And then, that's right, that was Game Boy Advance. And the second runner,

990
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:08,480
which was a sequel for the PlayStation 2. There was, speaking of anime from before, Sunrise,

991
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:17,440
one of the, I'd say one of the greater animation studios, did two anime that were related to Zone

992
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,640
of the Enders. And then the game was re-released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 along with Zone of

993
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:29,280
the Enders, the second runner, in October 2018 as a Zone of the Enders HD collection.

994
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,240
Which, by the way, for those watching on Twitch right now, you're seeing footage from the HD

995
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:39,440
collection. The original did not look this good. Yeah, but it's the same game.

996
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:47,600
It's the same game. Yeah. So anyway, it is a third person hack and slash game where you are a child

997
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:54,720
that pilots a mecha and you basically go around to different parts of the space colony that orbits

998
01:04:54,720 --> 01:05:03,040
Jupiter and attack these rogue mecha, other orbital frames. And you have to minimize damage

999
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:09,200
around you, use strategic combat. You have ranked, your battles are ranked to see based on how well

1000
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:18,000
you do within your parameters. And then you can go different ways. It's a non-linear path that you

1001
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:27,680
can take. And you also have to find this aura called Metatron Ore to repair your mecha. You've

1002
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:34,400
got your usual type of mecha combat. You have lock-on targeting for things at a distance. You

1003
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:39,520
have an energy sword and a projectile and other sub weapons. And your arsenal will grow the

1004
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,760
further you want to make it through the game. And after you beat the game, you get a versus mode

1005
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:51,040
where you can compete against an AI or another character. So frame versus frame.

1006
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,640
The game was originally under development for the original PlayStation and the PC, but Konami

1007
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:03,360
didn't really want to actually release them on that. They also had prototypes built for

1008
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:08,080
the Dreamcast. They were really focusing on the anime style for the robots,

1009
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:15,520
but adding more realism to it to compare with other sci-fi at the time. And then

1010
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:25,200
they wanted to write it. Actually, the scenario writer, Okamura Noriyaki, wanted to do a serious

1011
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:30,320
story that had complicated lives and it was supposed to examine the purpose and nature of

1012
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:38,560
life. And so they wanted to avoid having multiple endings, although there were different side quests

1013
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:43,200
that could have different endings. And so they also wanted to tell the story through gameplay

1014
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:49,600
instead of cut scenes. So, I mean, the game really, I think, it delivered in the style.

1015
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:55,040
It delivered in story. I mean, the localization, again, left some to be desired, but the action

1016
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:59,200
was really good on it. And yeah, I'd be great with a complaint that it probably could have been

1017
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:04,400
a longer game. But, I mean, just look how pretty it is. I mean, this is the HD one again, but even

1018
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:10,560
when the original came out, it was pretty, pretty. Some comments from chat. SDG100Matt says,

1019
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,720
I bought this to get the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo and being totally surprised about how awesome

1020
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:20,480
Zone of the Enders was. And Hype Mayhem saying, I remember that a lot of folks bought Zoe,

1021
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,240
if only because of the included Metal Gear Solid 2 demo. Well, I hadn't gotten to that yet. Thank

1022
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:30,000
you, chat room. Sorry. So, okay. So yeah, it came with a demo. So there, that part's talked about.

1023
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:38,720
But at any rate, it may, for Metacritic, it had an average score of 78 out of 100.

1024
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:45,200
And they thought the biggest praise it got was because of the use of the cinematography in the

1025
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:55,680
game with camera following the mecha. And GamePro actually preferred it to Armored Core 2 because

1026
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:01,520
it was responsive and quick and that the design was highly detailed. But yeah, most of the people

1027
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:07,440
were just like, it was too short. And they thought that the voice acting was emotionless.

1028
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,960
And being really, some people reported just being really annoyed by the voice acting in it,

1029
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:21,360
that there were people from whiny to dead. Which I mean, voice, early video game voice acting,

1030
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:25,040
I think was a little bit hit or miss. But then again, we also had just gotten off of

1031
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,560
having really amazing voice acting. Like, you know, again, we came out of Metal Gear,

1032
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:38,400
for example, another, you know, relating back to that. But yes, it did have the Metal Gear Solid 2

1033
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:49,760
Sons of Liberty demo, which probably drove most of the sales of this game. But it was, you know,

1034
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:56,960
really, really just a fun little game. And like I said, we had sequels, we had other related series

1035
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:03,120
and a full animation series that went right along with it. So there you go. Zone of the Enders is

1036
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:08,160
our game. Not bad for a game most people bought just to check out the demo for another game. But

1037
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,360
that happens sometimes. I seem to remember, what was it? The Final Fantasy 7 demo was with?

1038
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:23,120
Oh, it was that fighting game. No, it was done by, no, that was the final, was it Final Fantasy?

1039
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,840
Maybe I'm thinking Final Fantasy 8 was with Brave Fencer Musashi.

1040
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,080
I remember getting Brave Fencer Musashi.

1041
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,120
And, but there was another demo that came out.

1042
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,960
Toeball number one. Thank you.

1043
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:33,360
Yeah.

1044
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,320
Okay. That's a series that should continue on.

1045
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,400
Toeball number two was pretty fun too, but it only came out in Japan.

1046
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:45,200
All right. Well, there it is. Zone of the Enders, the classic game of the week. And I think

1047
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,040
Dara Sakura might be having a go. I don't know.

1048
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,480
I could do my last story.

1049
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,360
You want to do your last story?

1050
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:49,920
No, why not?

1051
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,440
Do you want to do it now?

1052
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,400
Yeah, I'll do it now.

1053
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,800
Okay. So let me skip ahead here. So go ahead and do your last story.

1054
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,920
Sorry about that. Well, it's a really quick thing anyway. You know how in the other Animal

1055
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:05,280
Crossings we could cheat with different memory cards and other systems and whatnot. You can

1056
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:14,800
have one island per switch. Even if you have other game cartridges, save files, you have

1057
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,400
one island per switch.

1058
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,880
Oh, so if multiple people play on that switch, it'll be kind of like the GameCube one where

1059
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,240
you could have like four people on your memory card type of thing.

1060
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,520
Exactly. And that's it.

1061
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,240
All right. I'm still looking forward to the game.

1062
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:32,320
Oh, totally. Well, honestly, I'm kind of pleased for that because I'm tired of people,

1063
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:36,720
you know, cheating and getting something in one place versus the other. So whatever.

1064
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:41,440
It's okay. Nintendo's just saying, oh, you want some more islands? Well,

1065
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,400
we've got some brand new things we'd like to show you.

1066
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,280
Check it out in our new Tom Nook DLC corner.

1067
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,400
Hey, we've got so many different switches. Did you try the switch light? It's pretty nice.

1068
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:57,200
I want them to do an Animal Crossing switch light. I'm not going to spoil on other things

1069
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:01,600
that might be talked about later on, but I really want a switch light so that I can have

1070
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,640
something that doesn't have detachable parts to take in my bag.

1071
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,480
Fair enough. All right. All right. Well, thank you, Dark Sakura. Have a great night.

1072
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,600
Sorry about the work schedule and we'll see you next week.

1073
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,120
You didn't give me the crap schedule.

1074
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,240
I didn't do it. All right. We'll see you next week.

1075
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:19,360
Meanwhile, let's move on over to Loki. What do you have for us?

1076
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,600
This is pretty incredible. So you may know that flash is

1077
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,480
there basically any support for flash December 31st of this year?

1078
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,880
Yes. My Google Chrome browser tells me that.

1079
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,520
I know all the time. I was like, dude, fuck off. When I check my calendar,

1080
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,160
it's not December 31st. So you can fuck right off, you know.

1081
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:45,520
So in the meantime, though, to prepare us for the world without flash

1082
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:54,400
comes Flashpoint is basically archiving thousands of old classic flash games

1083
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,920
that you may have enjoyed. And you can check this all out for free.

1084
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,000
And the these are all downloadable and playable on your computer.

1085
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,760
So includes, you know, stuff from, you know, many sites like Miniclip.

1086
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:15,200
It is a very large. What the hell?

1087
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,400
It's a very large car horn is not. It's not coming from your computer.

1088
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:24,800
No, it's not my computer. It's a very large. Did the diners fucking win?

1089
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,040
Because if they won, that's all we're going to hear all night horns.

1090
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:34,000
Yeah. Riots and shit. Anyways, very large archive.

1091
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,320
Oh, no. Tiger class says the Chiefs won. Thank God.

1092
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:46,160
Sorry. Not sorry. Like if y'all could behave when your team wins a game, then I wouldn't care.

1093
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:49,840
But people don't know how to fucking behave. So apparently we have a Chiefs fan across the street.

1094
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:55,600
Wonderful. Anyways, so you can download the archive. They have several different

1095
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:59,520
things like different sets of games that are in here.

1096
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,520
The whole archive itself is like two hundred ninety gigabytes, which is quite large.

1097
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:08,160
But you don't have to download everything. You can actually still because you could

1098
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,880
most hard drives they sell now are like three terabytes.

1099
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,960
All right, right, right. You could fit decades. I'm not I'm not saying that it's impossible to

1100
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:19,360
store that much data on your system. I mean, it's very possible. I'm just thinking that's

1101
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,720
a good third of your bandwidth cap right there. You know, if you think about it.

1102
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:31,840
Um, so, yes, if if for whatever reason, you know, of these 36000 games that are included in here,

1103
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:36,000
your favorite game is not among them. You can actually suggest that they archive

1104
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:42,480
other games as well and they will go ahead and do that. But yeah, it is very large.

1105
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,920
They have a master game list that's in here and everything.

1106
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:55,360
Popcap. Yeah, it's just I don't even know what half of these what is half of this of like

1107
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:00,800
pencil kids dot com. It's it's very clearly a bunch of sites you probably never checked out ever.

1108
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:07,840
Do they have a wasn't a don't shit your pants a flash game? I don't know. It may have been.

1109
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,960
I know that one of my they had they had a trailer, though, that was like showing off some of the

1110
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,560
games that were in there, like some of the stick fight games they had. I think

1111
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:25,520
one of the original versions of Superhot was a flash game. But yeah, lots of really classic

1112
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:31,200
stuff. I knew I knew someone would ask. So I have to answer this. Pod culture and chat says

1113
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:39,120
flappy vog flappy vog, you know, is available at vog network dot com. Mr. Black Wolf built that in

1114
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:44,160
unity. So I do not believe it uses flash. I don't know. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. It's like

1115
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:48,720
oh, yeah, it's HTML five. So you'll be happy to be part of the arc. You'll be happy to know that

1116
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:56,480
don't shit your pants is part of the archive. One of my all time favorite flash games. Yes.

1117
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:02,880
It's the reason why I love that game so much is this it's the sound it makes when you

1118
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:10,320
are just just the whole ending sequence of the game when you do, in fact,

1119
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:14,640
shit your pants. It's that little like instead of a sad trombone, it makes us a little like

1120
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:25,200
but yes, there's too many games for me to even go into, but definitely go check it out. We're

1121
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:33,680
going to read the name of all 30 games right now. Starting with it's going to be a whole lot of

1122
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,840
monkey go happy games because they have a ton of them. Fifth dream today and chat says they're

1123
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:49,200
also archiving flash animations. So oh my God, we forever. Oh, good. Does that weren't strong,

1124
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:54,160
bad emails and flash? Yes. Then I hope to God somebody is preserving those.

1125
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,920
I would think that. Hey, you're back. A lot of people have been going back and redoing

1126
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:05,120
things in HTML 5. Oh, good. Important update. Thank you. All right. Let's see. Other comments

1127
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:11,120
in chat. Let's see. There are unique in the games, though. They're part of this.

1128
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:19,200
So maybe some of the older Unity games. They have like some Terry Cavanaugh games.

1129
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:26,960
I don't know. Oh, yeah. Would the original suit like hexagon super hexagon be a flash game?

1130
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:32,240
I don't know. This seems to be organized in a sort of manner. So they've got like it's snow

1131
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:38,320
drift, red sky radio silence are the three games in this list for Terry Cavanaugh, CB2. I guess

1132
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:44,320
he's a lot of this old stuff. Well, and let's be real. Probably the flash game you are most

1133
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:49,680
concerned about is Frog Fractions. Like, I mean, as much as I hype up other flash games,

1134
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:55,200
Frog Fractions really probably is the all time greatest flash game. So you might wonder like

1135
01:16:55,200 --> 01:17:01,440
what what happens to Frog Fractions when Google Chrome and the other browsers no longer run flash?

1136
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:08,240
Well, the good news is Frog Fractions, the game of the decade edition will has appeared on steam.

1137
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:15,920
It will have a mid to late 2020 release. So no idea when that will actually happen. And

1138
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:22,800
maybe you forgot what Frog Fractions is. Great. Even better. Even better. Just just play. Go in

1139
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,680
blind. I saw him play the second one yet. Yeah. Apparently the second one is like one of those.

1140
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:32,800
The sequel never as funny as the original. But I'm here like people are like, it was OK,

1141
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:40,400
but it just like it in the second one, you kind of you know, to expect the randomness

1142
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:45,520
of what Frog Fractions is in the first game, you weren't expecting you were expecting just

1143
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:49,680
to do fractions. Well, I mean, you kind of think, OK, this is going to take a disturbing turn.

1144
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:54,240
And then like, what the fuck? Like, you know, the first game has a lot of those moments

1145
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:58,480
where it's like, what the fuck? And like, you know, it's kind of like, oh, you expect those

1146
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:04,080
in the second game. So I should make my kids play that game. You should be. That would be funny.

1147
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:09,920
The film anyway. So that's very good to hear that Frog Fractions will be making a return on steam.

1148
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:14,720
And honestly, I'll probably buy it because I'm a consumer whore. I am a whore for Frog Fractions.

1149
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:19,040
Ain't that the truth? Hell, yes. The Flash game for Fast Five is part of this as well.

1150
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,960
Is it really in The Simpsons? All those terrible movie tie in games

1151
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:29,280
are probably part of it. Drunken wrestlers. This is this is a Twitch stream in the making,

1152
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,880
going through and playing some of the old Flash games. Candy Mountain Massacre Revenge.

1153
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:38,320
Wait, is that based on the YouTube Candy Mountain? Charlie, you gotta go to Candy Mountain. No,

1154
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:42,000
they have the finale, though. They're starting to put the finale out. Have you watched any of that

1155
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,040
yet? I, I did not even know in the year of Our Lord 2020 that Candy Mountain was still a fucking

1156
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:53,120
thing. Yes, it is. They had a Kickstarter a long time ago and they finally just started

1157
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:58,080
to put out the finale and the first episode was super long. It had nothing. It has anyone

1158
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:03,840
out there watched beyond the first one that, you know, I've watched all of them and I've watched

1159
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:13,200
Charlie Tech Unicron, which is hilarious. OK, I am a big fan. Do you make the kids watch it?

1160
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:18,240
I did make the kids watch it. Did they like it? I did not make them watch all of the llamas

1161
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:23,520
with hats. Some of it because it started to get a little violent, but they thought it was funny.

1162
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:29,440
Right. Let's move on. We're going to travel around and check out some quick news from around the

1163
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:36,560
globe. All right. So let's talk a little bit about what we're going to be getting for. Well,

1164
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:43,120
not exactly free, free, free and free with our mandatory subscriptions. Subscriptions are

1165
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:49,280
mandatory. Please enjoy this free game. So for games with gold, uh, we get, uh,

1166
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:58,160
let's see, it looks like TT Isle of Man. And if he's, if you get to see some TTs in the island,

1167
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:08,320
it is a motorcycle racing game. Oh, joy. And Call of Cthulhu on Xbox 360 compatible games,

1168
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:13,840
Fable Heroes. Oh, cool. Um, I don't know if that's cool because it looks terrible.

1169
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:19,840
A Fable Heroes in Star Wars Battlefront, the old one. Oh, um, so those are going to be coming

1170
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:25,760
in February. OK. In the PlayStation side of things, we are going to be getting, um,

1171
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,800
Bioshock the collection. Okay. That's really rad. Pretty awesome. Uh, you know, just, you know,

1172
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:38,800
a lot of people, a lot of speculation that this is coming out as a free in quotes game. Um, because

1173
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:44,160
there's a, the new Bioshock will be one of the big reveals at PlayStation fives reveal.

1174
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:49,680
I hope so. The infinite was great. I mean, all of them have been pretty, I think the only one

1175
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:55,040
I haven't played through is two. I played through one infinite. Two was different because Ken Levine

1176
01:20:55,040 --> 01:21:01,600
wasn't directly involved with two, but like I played and I didn't do the DLC on all that stuff

1177
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,000
as well. But, um, I don't know. I don't think you need to, it's not really the full, you know,

1178
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,760
the full game. I hope the news about Bioshock making a return on the next generation is true

1179
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:14,320
though, which by the way, real quickly, just aside with PlayStation five and reveals and all that,

1180
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,960
there was a fake tweet going around this last week from an account that looked like it was

1181
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,640
the official PlayStation account, but it wasn't. If you check the spelling it's wrong and there's

1182
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:27,840
no check Mark on the account. And it was trying to say, uh, PlayStation five unveiled February

1183
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:34,000
15th at the theater and knew the PlayStation theater knew that was a false tweet. So if you

1184
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,760
retweeted that going OMG or whatever, congrats, you fell for a misinformation campaign. Uh, granted,

1185
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:44,160
it was probably somebody in their basement just acting like a fool or somebody trying to impress

1186
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:49,440
their friends by going viral with a lie. Um, but unfortunately there's a lot of that type of

1187
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:54,400
bullshit on Twitter. So please, please, please be careful. Uh, when you retweet things, if

1188
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:59,040
something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If you're only reading about it on Twitter

1189
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:03,360
and nowhere else. I mean, it depends, it depends what we're talking about. If we're talking about

1190
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:08,960
people on the ground at a scene somewhere where something is unfolding, then maybe, but even in

1191
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,560
those cases, you always have some jackass that isn't really there. That's trying to put their

1192
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:18,400
own thing into it. So just, you know, be careful and, uh, don't be the one that spreads around

1193
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:23,600
misinformation. Anyway, I said, cause I saw a lot of that retweeted with OMG and I'm like,

1194
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:31,040
y'all Twitter security one Oh one, come on. All right. Um, the Sims four is the other game that

1195
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:38,960
would be getting in a PlayStation VR firewall, um, zero hour. So check those out. I don't think I

1196
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:43,440
have the collection. I have the collection on PC. So I'll be, I, yeah, I definitely don't have it

1197
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:48,240
on PS four. I have both those games. I think at one point they gave out Bioshock and Bioshock

1198
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:53,280
infinite on PS three, but you can go way back to PlayStation plus back then. I think they gave

1199
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:57,920
those games away before, but we haven't seen the, uh, you know, uh, remaster good. It's worth

1200
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,800
going through. I haven't, you know, I haven't played those in a while. Infinite was super great.

1201
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:10,400
Yeah. Um, and then also we have a speaking of nostalgic and flash, um, the behemoth, uh, they

1202
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:15,920
talked about what their next project is going to be, which is alien hominid invasion. So it's going

1203
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:21,680
to be an all new re-imagining of the, the first game that the studio put out. And of course you

1204
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:27,840
may remember them not only from alien hominid, but of course castle crashers. So we'll have to

1205
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:33,520
see what this is going to be. It says it's going to be a co-op arcade shooter, similar to metal

1206
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:39,120
slug, but I mean, hominid was pretty fun and castle crashers is fun. So this is probably

1207
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:44,160
going to be fun. Can't wait. Yeah. Looking forward to it. Um, mentioned earlier in the show by dark

1208
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:48,800
Sakura, uh, kind of referenced here, there is a new animal crossing switch coming out. She's just

1209
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:54,240
a little irritated. It's not a switch light. It is a regular switch with the dock, but, uh, if that's

1210
01:23:54,240 --> 01:24:00,560
what you're looking for, it's fucking cute. Uh, like I, I'm, I cannot justify spending $300 cause

1211
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,000
something's fucking cute, but if I didn't have a switch yet, this would probably be the one I'm

1212
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,160
getting. Uh, it's coming out on March 13th and it's going to have very cute green and blue.

1213
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:12,480
They're kind of like the, the colors of the ocean a little bit. So that kind of like softer green

1214
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:18,160
and blue. Uh, those are the colors. It's, it's not an ingress switch, uh, is that different,

1215
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,920
different types of green and blues, uh, that are showing up. But I think it's really cute.

1216
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:27,120
Uh, and there'll be actually be a dock that actually has, um, uh, little, uh, Tom Nook and,

1217
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:32,160
and his, uh, kids on it. And then like the switch itself on the back is really adorable.

1218
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:36,480
And yeah, honestly, if I didn't have a switch yet, or like I'm finally breaking down and getting a

1219
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:42,480
switch because of Animal Crossing, like this would be the way to go unless you really want

1220
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:47,680
a light for your situation. Then unfortunately nothing has been announced for you yet. And I kind

1221
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:52,880
of feel like with this news, they're not going to announce a light. Um, anything's possible,

1222
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:59,920
I suppose, but doesn't look bloody likely. So anyhow, also in other news, uh, we, we have a

1223
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:06,320
story about, uh, Ninja's management firm, um, which, uh, is, um, trying to figure out what

1224
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:17,840
the name of it is here. Um, anyway, the firm that he is with is trying to reach out more into

1225
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:22,720
diversity. Um, which I think is, is a good thing to talk about. You know, we've talked a lot about

1226
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:30,400
these streamers that have moved from Twitch to YouTube or Twitch to Mixer. And, you know,

1227
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:35,440
we got a lot of white dudes in there, which, you know, there's a lot of cool white. I'd like to

1228
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:40,720
think Loki and I are pretty cool white dudes, but you know what? I know some pretty cool women. I

1229
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:45,600
know some pretty cool people of color and all these people do streaming as well. And it would

1230
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:51,520
just be nice to maybe see, you know, some folks in the big leagues that are a little bit more

1231
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:57,040
reflective of what the population of the entire world looks like and not just one part of it.

1232
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:02,240
Um, one very small part of it. So, um, yeah, I think this is very good that, you know,

1233
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:07,840
they're trying to push to get more, uh, folks, you know, signed with this and pushing forward

1234
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:13,200
with trying to bring a little more diversity, uh, into the streaming world, which is, uh, great.

1235
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:19,760
Um, so, uh, let's see, I'm trying to see where the action is here. Uh, Loaded is the name of

1236
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:25,200
the company. Thank you. Um, and, uh, they represent 36 gaming content creators.

1237
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:29,920
Five of them are women. Uh, and they're saying we're actively seeking to diversify our portfolio

1238
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:33,520
of talent, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it's also what's best for the

1239
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:38,000
business and industry. Those who are in a position to, to should be thinking about this and doing

1240
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,080
what they can to more accurately represent diversity within their ranks and content

1241
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,680
in order to accelerate this leaders in our industry need to support women and other minority

1242
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:49,360
groups to create a more inviting and supportive landscape for everyone. It's something Loaded

1243
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:53,760
will be intentional about. And I look forward to playing a big role in our strategy there.

1244
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:59,760
So, um, best of luck. And I, I hope we hear about some more names, uh, from all types of

1245
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,720
individuals. So let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Let's start in the

1246
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:10,480
U S Loki. All right. We've got, I mean, I guess this is tying in with the, the new show, but the

1247
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:16,480
dark crystal age of resistance tactics. So, you know, they just screen that while I was out of

1248
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:21,920
town for work, uh, Alan went to the crest and saw like a screening, I guess there it's in movie

1249
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:26,720
theaters for a hot minute too. So yeah, I thought it was pretty cool. Uh, that's coming out on PC,

1250
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:32,640
Mac, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one. We have zombie army for dead war. That's on

1251
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:41,520
PC PlayStation four and Xbox one and a grand blue fantasy versus on PlayStation four marooners on

1252
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:48,000
Nintendo switch and crash drive two on Nintendo switch. That is it. All right.

1253
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,400
Let's go to Japan and check out some of the releases coming out there. And now that we're

1254
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:57,120
getting into February, if you can believe it, uh, getting into February's releases in Japan,

1255
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:03,200
uh, I don't think there's a ton of stuff. Uh, in fact, this week, I think we just have

1256
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:07,600
some peripherals coming out, some stickers and things. I don't see any games, at least on the

1257
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,920
switch. I know there's a new Hatsune Miku game coming out, um, next week, but we'll talk about

1258
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:16,320
that next week. Uh, in the meantime, let me see if there's anything on PlayStation four

1259
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:21,280
that is on its way. Oh yes. We have a little bit more on the PlayStation four grand blue

1260
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:27,920
fantasy versus is out this week. A game called, is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon

1261
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:32,640
infinite combat? I feel like we had a similarly named game before and it was an anime based thing.

1262
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:38,320
Well, yeah, I mean, I can tell you right. That's that question shall be answered this

1263
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:42,720
week in Japanese releases. Is it wrong to try to pick up girls into dungeon? Uh, grand blue

1264
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:49,280
fantasy versus also out on the PlayStation four this week and ease nine, apparently a new pressing

1265
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,960
of that. Cause I think that game has been out, but I guess a new version of it and also a rugby game,

1266
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:59,280
rugby 20, uh, meaning for 2020, I'm sure also out in Japan this week. Um, how about the UK?

1267
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:06,480
All right. UK don't have a whole lot coming out. Uh, mainly just, uh, monster energy supercross

1268
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:15,200
three on PlayStation. We have a X-Box switch and PC, uh, zombie army for dead war on X-Box

1269
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:27,040
one and PlayStation four and that's it. All right. Um, let's move on to the email bag.

1270
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:32,160
Every week you guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send

1271
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:36,480
those emails and we read some of our favorites here on air. So you should send us an email for

1272
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:41,600
a future week. Participate at orange lounge radio.com and we're going to get to our,

1273
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:46,720
I think this is the one and only email we have this week. Yeah. So our email tonight is from Rob.

1274
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:50,480
I like your name. Uh, I don't recognize the email, so I don't think this is the Rob,

1275
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:56,080
but, but, uh, and this is only Rob with one B like me. So I don't think it's just, it's just,

1276
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:01,200
it's just plain Rob like me, one B. Uh, so I believe this is a new emailer, although I could

1277
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:05,920
be wrong. So I apologize if you've emailed before. Um, but usually dark soccer does this. So I will

1278
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:11,120
just say I'm new here. Anyway, we have a pretty lengthy email, so let's get to it. Dear OLR.

1279
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:16,800
I recently re-watched the legendary documentary King of Kong and it really made an impact on me.

1280
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,720
For those who have not seen it, King of Kong is the story of an underdog, Steve Weeby,

1281
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:25,280
trying to beat the donkey Kong arcade world record of Billy Mitchell. Uh, I know I've seen it and

1282
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:29,760
I assume you've seen it as well. I have not. Oh, you haven't. Okay. Well, I I've seen, I don't

1283
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:34,320
need to watch it. I, I understand. Uh, moving on. The interesting thing about watching this

1284
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:39,440
documentary again was that since I had first watched it in 2007, video analysis has proved

1285
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:43,760
that Billy Mitchell had actually illegally submitted his score using an emulator play

1286
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:48,160
through, which prompted twin galaxies to remove all of his records from their database.

1287
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:52,560
His good friend, Todd Rogers held hundreds of records and also had his records removed after

1288
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:57,440
analysis proved that his scores were not even possible. Billy's other friends, Steve Sanders,

1289
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:03,040
openly admitted to cheating in donkey Kong in the eighties. Were they friends? I don't know.

1290
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:09,120
I mean, I guess they would all be part of this interesting fraternity of like dudes who scored

1291
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:17,120
high in video games, but like, did they send each other Christmas cards? Like how I feel like friends

1292
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:22,000
can be a very bad though. Like who lies about video game achievements? I mean, I kind of think

1293
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,760
that's where the rest of this email is going. Let me finish it up. After processing all of this,

1294
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,360
it started to paint a picture in my head of what actually happened in the eighties when video

1295
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:34,480
arcade records were starting to be recorded. To me, it seems like it was a tight knit group of

1296
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:39,840
record holders and Walter Day who protected each other, probably knowing full well that the scores

1297
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,720
were not legit. They knew that by exposing the false high scores would, excuse me, they knew

1298
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:48,800
that exposing the false high scores would compromise the integrity of twin galaxies

1299
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:53,760
and their tight knit community. Hell, it even questioned if their small town of Otumwa was

1300
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:57,840
actually the video game capital of the world, whatever that means. Makes you wonder how many

1301
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,800
people were cheated out of the glory of a high score back in the day. Just curious if you thought

1302
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:08,240
this was a widespread issue within twin galaxies or just a few bad apples. Were you disappointed

1303
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:12,960
knowing one of the greatest video game legends turned out to be a shame? Would love to hear your

1304
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:21,120
thoughts. And that is from Rob. So, is Fifth Dream today suggesting this is Mr. Awesome?

1305
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:28,000
Is this Mr. Awesome secretly sending this email? This really does sound like a Mr. Awesome, right?

1306
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,480
This goes, okay, the reason why they keep bringing back up Mr. Awesome is that goes back to when this

1307
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:37,600
program was on All Games Radio and the kind of flagship show over there, All Games Interact,

1308
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:42,000
because I remember I drove down to the studio. I was in LA once when they were doing All Games

1309
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,680
Interactive and Scott Rubin. And it was one of those Mr. Awesome episodes because he was showing

1310
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:49,840
up all the time. And I was like, Oh my God, what the fuck have I walked in? Like, it's like, it was

1311
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:54,000
like, it was like a fucking soap opera, all this twin galaxy stuff. I don't even remember the

1312
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,760
details. I just remember the catch phrases, like, you know, let me finish because I let you finish

1313
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:04,800
all that stuff. And just, it was crazy. Anyway, what do you think about this whole issues and

1314
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:09,520
twin galaxies and so forth? I'm over it already. In fact, I wouldn't even say I'm over it because

1315
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:20,000
I never was even interested in it. So I'm very still an interested in it. It's just drama in

1316
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:25,120
like shit I don't even care about. Like the only time I ever cared about like world records was

1317
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:29,760
when I did that stupid, um, ready player one competition, which that was a whole bunch of

1318
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:34,960
bullshit anyways. It was like simple, simple shit. Oh, Hey, by the way, break a world record now.

1319
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:40,400
Okay. Fuck you. How about that? Um, I don't know. I just, I don't care.

1320
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:47,360
My answer to this is kind of complicated. I just think twin galaxies is a relic of a different

1321
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:53,520
time is what it really is. Like twin galaxies is what existed in the eighties. Cause one thing,

1322
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:58,080
okay. There's cause one little thing that like with your email where I'm kind of like,

1323
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:02,560
eh, I think there's kind of like a jump that's happening here is the part that talks about,

1324
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,560
uh, Billy Mitchell illegally submitted his score using an emulator playthrough,

1325
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:09,920
which prompted twin galaxies to remove all of his records from their database.

1326
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,200
They didn't have emulators in the eighties. I don't think you could emulate donkey Kong

1327
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:20,720
accurately on a PC until the late nineties. When did maim start late nineties? My point is,

1328
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:24,960
and I'm not like, I'm not discounting your points and some of this other crap that came out and I'm

1329
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:30,000
well aware of the many conspiracy theories and all this stuff and the videos and all this stuff.

1330
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:37,040
Here's what it is. Do I think these guys are very good at video games from the 1980s? I do.

1331
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:40,880
Are they better than me? Yes, they are. Are they the best in the world?

1332
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:49,600
They're the best that this person, Walter Day, who put together this organization that nobody

1333
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:55,680
else was willing to do in the 1980s and run things his way, just whether you liked it or

1334
01:34:55,680 --> 01:35:00,640
not in this whole thing, you know, the videotapes and all that stuff, this was what he was able to

1335
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:07,120
collaborate. And to his credit for better or for worse, they were the first to try to make video

1336
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:13,680
games a bit video gamers, shall we say a bit of a celebrity. It's because of things like

1337
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:22,160
twin galaxies that we, um, later on ended up, um, uh, you know, getting the, the magazine spreads

1338
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:27,040
and things like this of these guys who were very good at video games. Were they the best in the

1339
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:32,480
world? Hard to say. They're the best that were able to be found through this process. They probably

1340
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:36,960
weren't the best in the world. They were, cause you know, there's always somebody better, right?

1341
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:40,560
But they were the best that was able to be found through this process. My point is,

1342
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:46,720
look at where we're at now in the year 2020. Lots of people can become video game celebrities

1343
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:52,880
because it's so easy to just start your own channel on Twitch or make a YouTube thing or,

1344
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:57,840
uh, do something else. Right. And so now it's like more people were finding these

1345
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:02,960
awesome gamers all over because it's so much easier to kind of start your own thing.

1346
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:07,360
And of course with the technology and everything, now we get more exposed to things like emulators

1347
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:13,600
and some of these other things where people cheat. So are maybe some of these people cheating because

1348
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:18,880
they want to hold on to some sense of relevancy. It's almost like a midlife crisis.

1349
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:25,280
Like these guys were what, 18, 20 years old in the eighties. So how old are they now?

1350
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:29,760
They're at like fifties and something like that. And maybe are there some that are willing to go

1351
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:37,040
to a length that is somewhat questionable to maintain some sense of relevancy in an era

1352
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:42,640
that is making the video game celebrity culture of the 1980s and maybe early nineties irrelevant

1353
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:50,160
today, perhaps. But are they all cheating on purpose? I don't know. Hard to say. I haven't,

1354
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:57,760
I'm not gonna, and respectfully, I'm not going to waste my time on five hour YouTubes that dissect

1355
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:02,800
these, you know, did Billy Mitchell play on a rogue machine and submit a score that way?

1356
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:07,200
I don't fucking know, to be honest. Um, the reality is we know there's a better Donkey Kong

1357
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:11,120
player. Right. And it was, and it wasn't either of these guys. It was that dentist or no guy.

1358
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,560
It's even gone fucking back and forth, right? There was the dentist. I don't know. And I don't

1359
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:19,600
care. I've already like so lost interest in it, but now that we're in the year 2020 or even the

1360
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:25,760
late 2010s, if we're talking about just the recent past couple of years, the, the easeability of,

1361
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:30,080
of filming your own thing and putting it out there, you don't necessarily need something

1362
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:35,440
like twin galaxies to be a warehouse of all these records that go through a strategic screening.

1363
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:38,800
Cause you can just make your own, put it on YouTube and say, here's my score. Here's my

1364
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:44,160
receipts. Bam. I don't need Walter blessings or Walter Day's blessing in order to claim that as

1365
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:50,400
my score where in the 1980s you did. So I just, my long winded answer here is to kind of say,

1366
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:56,240
like, I just think the culture has changed so much that we don't need a Pope to bless

1367
01:37:56,240 --> 01:38:02,320
these high scores anymore. That twin galaxies in that form is not really relevant anymore.

1368
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:06,320
And that's why we talk about these Oh two more jokes and things where it's like,

1369
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:13,280
they're trying to hold onto that relevancy, but it's, it's unfortunately technology and where

1370
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:18,400
we've gone. It's just not the same. Now I'm not going to talk about twin galaxies as an

1371
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:22,640
organization because a, I don't really know what they're doing these days, but I would hope they've

1372
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:26,320
kind of maybe transformed. I think they were running like a media network, a channel at some

1373
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:31,760
point, maybe celebrating classic gaming and cool. That's what it should be at this point is, you

1374
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:35,360
know what, we're going to celebrate classic gaming. We're going to still party like it's

1375
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:39,840
1985 and that these are, you know, the big games, the moment and so forth. But the reality is the

1376
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,240
culture and the celebrity and all that shit has changed as far as Billy Mitchell cheating and all

1377
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:51,280
that. My only counter question, because this is the thought that comes to mind. Does, does he know

1378
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:57,040
maybe he's cheating in every circuit? Like here's the thing I've played a lot of Pac-Man machines

1379
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:01,440
over time. I couldn't tell you which ones were running on an emulator potentially,

1380
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:05,920
or which ones were tweaked behind the scenes to possibly produce a different score.

1381
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:11,440
If he was playing machine at a different place, is it possible that he just didn't know the machine?

1382
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:14,480
I don't know. And I know there's a lot of Billy Mitchell haters out there that would say, yes,

1383
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:19,200
he knew it was all a scam and all this stuff. Maybe, I don't know, but I just also kind of

1384
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:25,760
think maybe he wasn't in on it. I mean, he was good at Donkey Kong. He's played the game live

1385
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:30,480
for people before and so forth. Is he the best in the world? I guess that's debatable at this

1386
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:36,080
point. Is he better than me and most people? Probably. Definitely. So here's another thing

1387
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:41,200
about Billy Mitchell you may not be aware of. I met the guy. I met the guy a couple of times.

1388
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:45,120
I don't expect that he knows me or recognizes me by name or anything, but it's not about that. I'm

1389
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:49,040
not big on celebrity culture anyway, but I've met the guy a couple of times and I'm going to tell

1390
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:55,600
you something. He's a pretty nice guy and nothing like what you see in the YouTubes and the movies

1391
01:39:55,600 --> 01:40:01,040
and all this stuff. Billy Mitchell that you guys all see is playing a character. He's playing a

1392
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:07,120
part. Just recently Paris Hilton came out and said, yes, I was playing a part that whole time

1393
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:10,160
during A Simple Life. I knew exactly what was going on and where I stood. And there's some

1394
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:13,600
people that say, yeah, right. And there's other people that say, I knew it the whole fucking time

1395
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:18,160
and I'm one of those people. I knew it. Paris Hilton's fucking smart. I know. I said it,

1396
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:21,280
quote it, put it on the back of the box. Paris Hilton's fucking smart. She knew what she was

1397
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:25,200
doing to that whole time making money and so forth. Sometimes you're playing a character

1398
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:28,720
and it's one of those things where like, you know what? Even the negative coverage,

1399
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:32,320
it's still coverage. It's getting you talked about. It's selling hot sauce,

1400
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:39,520
you know, or whatever it is, right? So, but like I've been around when Billy's having one-on-one

1401
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:44,400
conversations. He's had one-on-one conversations with me and this might shock you. He's just a

1402
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:50,800
normal fucking person. He's just a normal person like you, like me. I'm a normal fucking person too,

1403
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:57,760
really. I am. So, people only put these guys up on pedestals because I don't know. So,

1404
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:01,920
and I'm not, I'm not talking bad about Billy Mitchell. I'm actually not. I'm actually telling

1405
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:10,320
you guys, he's a nice guy, but I also don't get into all these weeds and all this stuff about,

1406
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:15,600
you know, all this, all this. So, I don't know. Those are my long thoughts. I'll check chat.

1407
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:19,520
Loki, you have any thoughts on this? No, still not interested in what, you know,

1408
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:26,960
I get it. You're good at playing the game. Good for you. Yeah, that's it. I mean,

1409
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,920
at some point you're not going to be the best and then you just have to get used to it.

1410
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:36,000
Let's see some comments in chat. Fifth dream today says, I'm friends with people who have

1411
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:42,240
been in movies and in bands. Everyone is just people. That's very true. Retro DeLorean in

1412
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:46,800
chat says, is there an equivalent of Billy Mitchell for pinball machines? I don't know

1413
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:50,400
if you're the person who sent these emails, but we actually did get a follow-up and I just fucking

1414
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:53,840
closed it because I'm a genius, but essentially that was the question. The follow-up was for Dark

1415
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:57,280
Sakura, who I'm sorry, she's left the building. So, I can't ask her directly. I'll have to ask

1416
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:01,360
her for next week, but is there an equivalent of that in the pinball world? And my answer is,

1417
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:07,120
I don't think so. I don't know anyone with that kind of personality, but they haven't really done

1418
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:13,600
movies of pinball besides like Tommy, but that's very different. So, I don't think that exists,

1419
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,120
but there are certainly are world record holders, I'm sure in pinball as well.

1420
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:24,640
And I would say a lot of, just after OLR last week, we hosted some people playing a theater

1421
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:30,880
or magic machine out in the pinball world. So, everything I said about the culture has changed

1422
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:35,120
and you can broadcast your own high scores. You don't need to go through a central hub or

1423
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:40,000
anything to do that anymore, would be true about pinball as well. So, if there is a celebrity,

1424
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,240
I would say just hearing Dark Sakura, when she talks about like the pinballs in classic games,

1425
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:48,080
I would say the pinball makers are the more celebrities in that world because she talks

1426
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:52,720
about certain machines by certain people and that's what she plays. So, I think the celebrity

1427
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:58,080
has probably went to them. Tiger Claw on chat says, how do you make movies about pinball

1428
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:03,200
interesting? Dude, the same way somebody made King of Kong, is Donkey Kong that interesting

1429
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:13,120
for two hours? No, but it was the drama, the good guy versus the bad guy. It was all that shit that

1430
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:17,360
made people get into that movie at the level they did. It was a very well done documentary.

1431
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:23,600
There's another one and god damn it, I can't remember the name. I don't think it was Chasing

1432
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:29,680
Ghosts, maybe it was, but there was another one, god damn it. It was a very obscure arcade game,

1433
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:34,560
the two were playing and the guy was supposed to like mimic the performer. They were always going

1434
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:39,520
against each other at like magfest. I remember like one of the early magfests was the climax of

1435
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:44,320
the film. It was like an early magfest towards the, it was a snake game that they were playing

1436
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:49,920
and I think the name of the movie had something to do with snakes. Anyway, that was another one

1437
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:54,880
that I'd watched. That was it, yes, Dark Tetsuya, that's right, Man vs Snake, that was the name of it,

1438
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:59,280
which I know it doesn't sound like a video game movie. It sounds like something a little

1439
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:03,360
perverted, but it was, it was very much, yes, Nibbler, that was it. Thank you, Dark Tetsuya,

1440
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:06,720
that was the documentary I'm thinking of. That was an interesting one as well.

1441
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:14,240
Other comments in chat, let's see, SG100Matt says, the documentary was good, it did take some

1442
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:19,760
liberties with the drama. It made it seem like Billy dodged Weebie when he really didn't.

1443
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:23,280
Fifth Dream Today says, I've heard Billy intentionally acts like a jerk whenever

1444
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:27,280
a camera's on him but is otherwise an okay guy. True.

1445
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:35,200
Questbuster says, back then you had to have some, you had to have a trusted someone as a witness,

1446
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:41,280
VHS tapes, photographers, and then check a monthly magazine for local scores, if even that, lots of

1447
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:45,600
holes for anything to happen back in those days. Oh, and Retro DeLorean does say in chat, I submitted

1448
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:51,920
this question and I can assure you I am not Mr. Awesome. All right, all right, well, you better

1449
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:56,800
not be. All right, no, I'm just kidding. So, but thank you for the email. I mean, it is, it's an

1450
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:01,600
interesting topic and I see why people get into it. And I think the documentary has really like

1451
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:06,160
perpetuated that a lot, but I think the reality is it's like, you know, the standards of tracking

1452
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:11,280
video game scores and video game accomplishments in the 1980s was just different than it is today.

1453
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:16,480
And look at the celebrity culture around gaming today. It's not necessarily about high scores.

1454
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:20,480
Is Ninja good at Fortnite? Well, he is kind of good at Fortnite actually, from what I understand,

1455
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:25,440
he plays a lot of it, right? But is he the best in the world at Fortnite? I don't think he is.

1456
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:29,840
Some of the best streamers out there and, you know, the people that are the celebrities now

1457
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:37,360
aren't necessarily the people that are great at video games. So, you know, anyway. All right,

1458
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:40,720
great question though. Thank you very much for that. And that was our only email this week.

1459
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:46,000
If you would like to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1460
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,680
We do have some more stories for you guys before we get to opening up Discord to see if there's

1461
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:54,560
any calls tonight, even though I know tonight is a little weird with all that's going on on

1462
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:59,920
the television and so forth. Although I guess that did wrap up. But I think more and more people

1463
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:04,160
are tuning in now that that's over. But, you know, I understand some people are like Bobby

1464
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:07,920
Blackwolf didn't do a show tonight because he went to a party and it's the one time a year he

1465
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:13,120
gets to see certain people. I get it. So, yes, I may not be into the Super Bowl, but I understand

1466
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:17,120
it's a cultural thing for some people. All right. But we have some stories. Let's get into it.

1467
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:21,440
Yes. So we talked this has been a while since we talked about this, but you may remember there was

1468
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:29,680
a company in Japan that was operating a Mario Kart type go kart experience. We were dressed

1469
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:36,640
up in costume and drive go karts around Japan. Oh, yeah, I do remember that. Well, is formerly

1470
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:43,920
known as Mar Marikar. They got in trouble with Nintendo before Nintendo said, stop doing that.

1471
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:50,240
And then they basically say, hey, we're unrelated to Nintendo. But then they went ahead and did it

1472
01:46:50,240 --> 01:47:02,240
again as now Mario Mobile Mobility is the company mobility. And cleverly now they have Nintendo has

1473
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:10,720
been awarded a total of four or 50 million yen in response to this, basically saying that Nintendo

1474
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:15,920
said it would continue to take steps against violations of intellectual property and brands

1475
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:22,320
and has worked hard to establish over many years. I mean, kind of had to come in. They already got

1476
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:28,080
warning saying, hey, you can't do this. Stop it. You cease this. And they're like, we're going to

1477
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:33,120
do it anyways. And they're like, OK, well, you're just going to get sued then. So, well, you know

1478
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:39,920
why now, especially to. Where are you going to where do you get to play official Mario Kart

1479
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:47,120
simulations in the very new future starting? Yes. And in Japan at Universal theme parks. Yeah. So

1480
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:51,680
it's the Universal theme park expansion, I'm sure is it. This is probably one of those things where

1481
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:57,280
Universal's tapping Nintendo on the shoulder saying, hey, yeah, I doubt I doubt I had anything

1482
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:04,000
to do with universal. It's more of just like, hey, you know, you guys are you're kind of borrowing

1483
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,200
our former property, you know, and we've already asked you this stuff. In fact, they said that they

1484
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:18,080
were originally awarded 10 million yen, but they apparently they tried to appeal it. So as part of

1485
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:27,040
that appeal, they increased the damages to 50 million. So that's hilarious. Well, so if Nintendo

1486
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:31,680
says to stop, you probably should stop. Yeah, because here's here's what the site said. So

1487
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:39,360
mobility, they said we have street carts and this is horribly broken English. We had street carts

1488
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:46,800
is providing our service as usual. Street carts is fully comply, as I see through local governing

1489
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:51,120
laws in Japan. Street carts is in no way a reflection of Nintendo, the game Mario Kart.

1490
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:57,360
We do not provide rental of Mario costumes. Oh, people are showing up in Mario costumes,

1491
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:00,080
probably taking pictures and stuff. I don't know about that, but probably,

1492
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:08,720
I mean, just for the pictures before, you know. Yeah, I don't know. I thought they had a thing

1493
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:12,480
like this in the States, too, like there was something in L.A. or something that was kind of

1494
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:18,240
like this. Well, and then, you know what? So we we we are not far because by your laser tag place,

1495
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:23,440
there is a go kart place. Yes. And I've only done that one time ever. But the one time I did it,

1496
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:28,960
I was like, this is like Mario Kart in real life. But without the show, I haven't been there since

1497
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:34,480
the because the original place that was there, what they were gas powered go karts when I

1498
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:38,240
originally went there. So you had to like when you were racing them, you had to put on the full

1499
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:43,520
helmet. You had to put on a jumpsuit. Was it not like that? They're electric now. Oh, and so

1500
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:48,240
they're they're quieter. They don't smell like fuel. Oh, yeah. That whole place smelled like

1501
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:54,320
gasoline. Yeah. No, not anymore. It's all electric. So and they before it used to be

1502
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:58,560
split up in the two different tracks, they like a really short track and a longer track. Now it's

1503
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:03,840
all one huge track. Oh, and so it's way different now. But I just haven't gotten to do it because

1504
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:08,000
it's expensive. I think we need to do something for our we need it. Oh, our team building night.

1505
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,720
We should totally do that. You know, I've been doing lately, though. I've been going

1506
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:18,480
rollerblading. Oh, really? We went to the rink twice. Is the rink that's in between all this?

1507
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:23,600
No, no, no, not that Rika. Sunrise Rollerland. But OK, you know, because my kids got skates now

1508
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:28,800
and they have this new thing where which is kind of cool. So you can sign them up for like it's

1509
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:33,920
like four dollars a kid and then they'll send you coupons each week for two free skiing sessions

1510
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:41,440
every week forever. So it's like it pays for itself already. Interesting. But yeah, I enjoy

1511
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:47,200
it now that I've got my nice skates. All right. Well, moving on to another story about when

1512
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:51,440
Nintendo tells you to stop, you should probably stop. We have other news this week that a

1513
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:55,920
California man is getting in a lot of trouble with Nintendo and for some other pretty big

1514
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:02,160
reasons as well. This guy's resident of Palmdale's name is Ryan Hernandez. He pleaded guilty to

1515
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:07,680
federal charges of hacking Nintendo systems, which is computer fraud and abuse and possessing child

1516
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:14,000
pornography, which is definitely the worst thing that he did. But being that we're reading stories

1517
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:19,920
from game blogs, these game blogs tend to focus on the video game part of the story. But you but

1518
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:25,680
anyway, the video game part of the story is that he phished Nintendo employees to get credentials

1519
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:30,400
in 2016 and used that to get confidential information, which was then leaked to the public.

1520
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:35,760
Details about the Nintendo switch even leaked before March 2017 when it was actually debuted.

1521
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:42,400
This all according to court records. Now, the FBI caught him and he said he would stop. But what

1522
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:51,280
happened? He pulled the Mari car. Oops. I did it again. He got in and the FBI seized the devices in

1523
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:57,840
June 2019. He broke into multiple servers, got information, bragged about it on his Discord and

1524
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:03,200
Twitter while leaking other data elsewhere. He also shared vulnerabilities in Nintendo's network

1525
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:08,160
with the community. Big yikes to all that. But if you ever wondered where some of these leaks come

1526
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:14,560
from, realize that not all of it is my uncle works for such and such place. The phishing and all this

1527
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:22,320
shit, that stuff's very real. That's phishing. You know how like in the news, they always talk about

1528
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:29,200
Hillary's emails, butter emails. Well, the hacking of the DNC, which to be fair was a little bit

1529
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:32,800
different than the Hillary emails issue, but this all kind of got looped in together about email

1530
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:38,800
issues, right? So the hacking of the DNC, that was phishing. That was phishing. How did Russia

1531
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:42,560
get in and get those emails? And I'm not trying to like get into politics or pick a side. I'm just

1532
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:47,840
stating this is what happened. So Russia sent a phishing email to somebody that worked at the DNC

1533
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:50,800
who clicked on it, fell for it, gave the credentials, and that's how they got in and got

1534
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:55,920
the emails. Okay. Nonpolitical Sony pictures. When all that information got hacked. Remember

1535
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,960
all those emails from Sony pictures? When Carrillo was pissed off about that movie that portrayed

1536
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:04,960
Ken John Moon in a negative light, and then they hacked Sony pictures and got all that shit on the

1537
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:10,640
internet. Yeah. Yeah. That was a phishing email as well. So like a lot of places of business in

1538
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:16,560
this day and age really train their employees. Yeah. They keep sending us fake phishing emails

1539
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:20,720
all the time. And if you accidentally click on it, then they're like, you got to watch another

1540
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:25,200
training video. It's like, ah, yep. So just something to think about when you looked at

1541
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:29,760
leaked information, it may not have always come from the cleanest of sources. So just,

1542
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:34,560
just saying is what it is. Anyhow. So this plea bargain, he will be sentenced to three

1543
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:40,320
years in prison, $259,000 in restitution to Nintendo, and will be registered as a sex

1544
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:49,040
offender. He will be sentenced on April 21st. But the, it would be, I guess even I don't,

1545
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:53,520
so he took a plea bargain of three years, even though the child pornography can carry up to 20

1546
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:58,640
years for that whole thing. So I don't know the ins and outs of all that. I'm going to admit,

1547
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:04,080
but he is going to prison because he said he would stop doing it and he kept doing it anyway.

1548
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:08,640
And then, you know, you also have this whole hideous issue of the child pornography as well,

1549
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:14,800
which I don't want to, you know, overlook that as why this individual went to prison. So anyway,

1550
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:20,480
so anyway, gross, ugly. I want to move on from that, but I did kind of want to make the point,

1551
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:24,320
you know, what's, and, you know, we talk about leaks and stuff here too. Granted,

1552
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,760
we talk about it when it's already on Twitter and all those other places. I mean,

1553
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:32,480
we're not going to be idiots and pretend, oh, this doesn't exist. But sometimes we have to

1554
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:39,360
remember these leaks and things, they don't always come from a squeaky clean source. So anyway,

1555
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:42,800
something to think about. Meanwhile, let's move on. We have a couple more stories for you guys.

1556
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:48,720
Loki. All right. I don't know why you would want to do this to yourself, but you can.

1557
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:56,160
So apparently someone made a fan, untitled Goose desktop app that basically is called

1558
01:54:56,160 --> 01:55:03,280
Goose desktop. And it's kind of a play on entitled Goose game, obviously. So what it does

1559
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:10,160
is it will actually unleash a goose onto your desktop, which will then do all sorts of things,

1560
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:20,560
including, you know, steal your mouse cursor. It will even like pop windows open. I don't know why

1561
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:27,600
you would want to do this to yourself, but. But yeah, you can have like, it'll try to steal your

1562
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:33,920
screens. That seems the type of thing you prank your coworker with on their computer, honk.

1563
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:40,560
It is, yes. So yes, if you're interested in checking it out, though, it is on itch.io. And

1564
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:48,720
yeah, I don't know if I would want to do this to myself. I just think. I think I would just

1565
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:52,400
drive myself nuts. It would drive me a little nuts, too. It's one of those things. It's kind

1566
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:57,200
of funny, though. Yeah, it's funny. Fifth dream today in chat says, I miss Windows 95 desktop

1567
01:55:57,200 --> 01:56:01,840
buddies. Quest Buster says, this reminds me, we need Indiana Jones desktop adventures back.

1568
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:07,280
You know, would y'all be mad if we made After Dark, the classic game of the week, some week?

1569
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:11,600
It's not really a game, but After Dark is kind of iconic. Y'all know what After Dark is? Do you

1570
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:16,800
know what you know? After dark screensavers, screensavers, iconic flying toasters. Yes,

1571
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:22,080
that was a screensaver. That was After Dark. So, and sometimes the screensavers were things that

1572
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:26,320
were like fucking with your desktop. Like there was like desktop shuffle that would just shuffle

1573
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:35,120
the pieces of your desktop in a like slide puzzle type of fashion. So yeah, I'm looking at the

1574
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:42,400
little video, whatever. So it just, it drags stuff onto your screen and tracks mud all over the place

1575
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:48,640
and all of your stuff. It causes like weird key presses and stuff to happen. I should put that on

1576
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:53,680
Alan's computer when he's not here, Teehee. That would be funny. Yeah, for a minute and then I'd

1577
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:59,360
get in a lot of trouble. Yes. Goose desktop, though. You can check that out. Samperson.itch.io

1578
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:03,760
slash desktop dash goose. Install it on your grandparents' computer for a good time.

1579
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:11,280
All right. I did not tell you to do that. All right. It's free. Free. Love that price.

1580
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:16,320
All right. Moving on. A few more stories for you guys before we open up Discord calls.

1581
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:20,640
And this one kind of ending on a sad note with this story. Well, I don't know if it's sad,

1582
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:26,640
it's just a sign of the times. Nintendo of Japan is soon going to stop repairing the Wii. So the

1583
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:33,040
Wii will no longer officially be supported. The Wii, of course, was released towards the end of 2006

1584
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:38,960
and the Wii still was kind of going for a little bit. Just Dance 2020 came out on the Wii after

1585
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:44,720
the Wii U and all that. Yes, yes. But all good things must come to an end. On their official

1586
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:49,520
website, Nintendo of Japan said they plan to terminate all the opportunities to officially

1587
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:54,000
repair the Wii. This means that Nintendo of America, Nintendo of Europe, and everybody else

1588
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,880
is going to follow suit very soon. Why are they doing this? Due to the, quote, difficulty of

1589
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:04,800
securing the parts necessary for repair. So the last date to get your Wii to Nintendo of Japan,

1590
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:12,640
if you need a repair on it, is March 31st, 2020. And that's it. So the end of an era. So the Wii

1591
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:17,200
will no longer be fixed and if yours breaks, then it is just a broken piece of garbage.

1592
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:25,680
Plastic waste. Are you sad to see the Wii get retired? You know, I had my Wii in the garage

1593
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:31,760
and then when my sister had watched our cat while we were in Disneyland, she took it.

1594
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:38,320
The only thing that kind of makes me sad about this is that, you know, there's so much on the

1595
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:42,880
Nintendo eShop that was on the Wii and then therefore the Wii U, because the Wii U was fully

1596
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:47,440
backwards compatible with the Wii, we know that. And I guess you could still, they haven't

1597
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:52,640
terminated support for the Wii U yet, but we kind of know that's coming, right? But my point is that

1598
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:57,520
there were a lot of cute games on the Wii Shop, like let's say the Castlevania Adventure Rebirth,

1599
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:04,400
right? That didn't come out anywhere else but the Wii Shop. Final Fantasy IV, the After Years.

1600
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:09,600
I do believe that came out in its 3D form in other places, but I think the only place to play that in

1601
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:16,320
2D is on the WiiWare. And PC or PSP, I think, also had a... Oh, you're right. You're right. But it

1602
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:22,800
was also different. It was the upgraded textures, not the original sprites that the Wii version

1603
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:26,960
used, like the original Final Fantasy IV sprites and everything. Yeah. So good point though,

1604
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:31,440
that the PSP had it. But my point is, it's just a matter of time before these cute little things

1605
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:34,080
that were on the WiiWare service, you're not really going to be able to play them anymore

1606
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:38,080
because the systems can't handle them. And it's not like you can download these on the Switch or

1607
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:42,160
anything like that. Alan, if you want to give me candy, just come over and hand it to me.

1608
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:44,240
I want to see gold things fly across the screen.

1609
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:48,400
I'm not going to catch it. If you throw that... What is that little piece of candy

1610
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:52,640
that you're offering me? What is it? Offer me candy. Oh, this looks... Is this a peanut

1611
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:57,440
butter cup? Fuck yeah. Do you want one, Loki? No. Oh, they're good. Dark Sakura brought... Ooh,

1612
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:00,800
three peanut butters. Dark Sakura brought cookies, if you want one of those cookies.

1613
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:04,080
Alan, do you want to say... I mean, we're ending a little early here. Do you want to say anything

1614
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:10,720
about your gaming or the things that you've been playing lately? I updated Overwatch.

1615
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:19,040
I updated Overwatch. It's on season 20. I know... I just... This isn't my first time on camera.

1616
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:25,360
I updated Overwatch. They're on season 20 now. I think the last time I played was season eight

1617
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:29,520
or nine. So it's been quite a while. There's only one new character that's been introduced,

1618
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:38,960
Sigma, since I played. As far as what competitive mode is like, the players, the attitudes, the

1619
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:46,240
slurs in chat, it's still bad. It's terrible. So this may be a shortly lived revisit.

1620
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:48,240
How do you feel about Overwatch 2?

1621
02:00:55,360 --> 02:01:03,120
It exists. It will exist. It's a thing that Blizzard announced. I feel similar to... There's,

1622
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:07,120
I guess, a big football game that happened. I know that's a thing. A lot of people are

1623
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:12,160
invested in it. I'm happy for them. Or sad, depending on who they rooted for.

1624
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:17,920
I feel similar about Overwatch 2. It is... It's a property. Blizzard's...

1625
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:21,520
What about Warcraft 3 reforged?

1626
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:28,400
Yeah. Well, I did not have any... I had no idea of all the stuff that went on with Warcraft 3

1627
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:32,880
reforged. All that news went right over my head. So when you told me that they turned off Battle

1628
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:41,120
Net for the original OG Warcraft 3, Blizzard, they don't know what they're doing. Or they do,

1629
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:48,240
and they're terrible. Toons is the driving cat is apparently running things over there right now.

1630
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:51,840
By the way, Alan, just because you are on camera, how much weight have you lost?

1631
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:58,720
You've lost a lot of weight. In the last 12 months, I've lost about 30 pounds.

1632
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:04,800
Congratulations. I'm not jealous or anything. So no, Alan's been doing the CrossFit thing and the

1633
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:10,880
meal prep. I got him an Instapot for Christmas and he uses it for meal prep. And you would

1634
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:15,040
think I would benefit from some of that weight loss stuff, but no, because I can't stop snacking.

1635
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:19,920
So there you go. You get some congratulations from our chat, by the way. So there you go.

1636
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:23,920
All right. Enjoy those peanut butter cups. You earned it. All right. Anything else we

1637
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:27,360
want to say about the Wii or any of that stuff? Let me see. I'm going to go see.

1638
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:28,800
It was a great system.

1639
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:30,880
It was. And it said...

1640
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:36,160
Where's my freaking Excite Truck sequel? Aside from Excite Bots, we don't count that.

1641
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:41,360
vognetwork.com slash discord. If you want to get in our discord and give us a call,

1642
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:44,240
or if you have a quick question, you can always post something in chat as well.

1643
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:47,520
If you are like, I don't feel like calling, you can always pose a question here in chat.

1644
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:51,360
If you'd like to talk about something else. I don't know if we have any last minute stories.

1645
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:54,880
There was just something I saw on my Twitter feed. I was trying to look up is basically

1646
02:02:54,880 --> 02:03:00,080
something from Google saying that Stadia, they're complaining. People are complaining.

1647
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:05,280
There's not enough games on Stadia. And they're like, it's not our fault that we're not announcing

1648
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:08,800
games. If you want game announcements, you're going to talk to publishers to

1649
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:15,280
announce games that are coming to Stadia. Um, Google, I would encourage you to look at

1650
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:20,880
a product called the Wii U and why it flopped. And, uh, you might want to come up with a better

1651
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:25,440
answer. Yeah. Cause they said we understand the desire to hear more specifics on games.

1652
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:31,920
After all, that is what it is about games. Of course, not all 120 titles will be announced

1653
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:37,600
by the Stadia team as we leave it up to publishers to make announcements about their IP slash games

1654
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:42,880
and which platforms they'll appear on just as we do with our exclusive content coming to Stadia.

1655
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:47,600
There are lots of reasons for time of those gaming or timing of those game announcements.

1656
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:52,480
Anything from plan, promotions, events, title readiness, proximity to the first playable demo,

1657
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:54,720
shareholder requirements, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1658
02:03:56,080 --> 02:03:59,840
By the way, I'm glad you brought this up because you reminded me, Oh, it's February. Now I need

1659
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:04,960
to go, go grab the newest Stadia games. Cause again, I didn't buy Stadia, but, um, my pal

1660
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:08,960
Bobby Black Wolf did, and he got a little friend pass thing and he was kind enough to give that

1661
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:12,720
to me, which I think works for like three months. Um, so I think this is the month where it will

1662
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:19,760
run out. Uh, but I was able to claim February's free games. I forgot that it's a new, so I got,

1663
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:24,320
and I, I didn't even know what games there were. So the games I got were Metro Exodus.

1664
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:30,640
That's cool. And, uh, guilt G Y L T, which I think that was their exclusive they had at launch.

1665
02:04:30,640 --> 02:04:35,520
Right. I think it was. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that was there. Yeah. Cause it didn't launch until

1666
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:41,680
November 19th, 2019 and it's by tequila works, which I think was one of Google's, uh, in-house

1667
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:46,240
things. So yeah. Thank you. Pixel pockets. Yes. That was the exclusive game. I thought so.

1668
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:49,760
So I'll have to check that out at some point. All right. We do have a call waiting in the green

1669
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:54,320
room. So why not? Uh, let's get to it and, uh, see what our listeners want to talk about. So

1670
02:04:54,320 --> 02:05:00,160
hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hi. Can you hear me? Hi. Yep. We can hear you.

1671
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:06,640
What's your name? Oh, cool. This is retro. Hi there. Uh, what's on your mind tonight?

1672
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:11,600
Hey, uh, yeah. So I was the one that asked the question about, uh,

1673
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:15,680
the Billy Mitchell. That's why I just wanted to assure people that I am not Mr. Awesome.

1674
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:20,720
Yeah. Am I crazy or did I pick up a, am I crazy or did I pick up a Canadian accent there?

1675
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,240
Uh, yes, I am from Canada actually. So you're definitely not Mr. Awesome.

1676
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:32,400
No, I am not Mr. Awesome. Um, but yeah, I wanted to just set the record straight about,

1677
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:37,280
um, the reason I was kind of interested with that was, um, it was not so much even the drama. I just

1678
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:42,880
thought, uh, I thought that that kind of whole segment of the internet that was talking about

1679
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:48,480
all that was really centered around all of this kind of culture that seems to be kind of coming

1680
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:53,760
forward. Like more recently, it seems like with the, all these one-up cabinets and all the retro

1681
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:59,680
gaming aspects of it, I just thought it was kind of a neat topic that's coming forward now about

1682
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:05,600
like the legacy of all these players. And, um, so I, yeah, I just want to, I was wanted to kind of

1683
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:10,080
hear your thoughts about that just cause I thought since you were, you've talked a lot about retro

1684
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:15,120
gaming and, and Jamie talks about the pinball and all that, that, uh, just that you might kind of,

1685
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:21,840
you know, have an interesting perspective on that. Um, well, I hope, I hope you were good with the

1686
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:26,000
perspective that I gave. Um, I think, I think, you know, but at the end of the day, it really is kind

1687
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:31,760
of about celebrity culture has really shifted. And I do think some of the good old boys from

1688
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:37,120
back in the day have probably really fought to remain relevant and they may or may not,

1689
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:41,200
I don't know, cause I don't live in their houses and inspect their machines. They may or may not

1690
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:45,360
have done some shady things to try to stay relevant. But the reality is, and I think,

1691
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:50,160
I think the best point that I made was probably towards the end there. When you look at the cult

1692
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:55,200
of video game celebrity today is that it's not necessarily the people who are the best

1693
02:06:55,200 --> 02:07:00,560
at video games that are the most famous because of it. Not to say that good gamers don't necessarily

1694
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:04,800
get. So, I mean, when you think about like awesome games done quick and an event like that, like,

1695
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:09,200
you know, those guys are in the spotlight now, granted I couldn't, can you name some speed

1696
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:15,280
streamers that were with awesome games done quick recently? Yeah, it's, I don't know. I don't recall

1697
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:20,240
their names as fast as you do Billy Mitchell. I do recognize there's talent. I only know like some

1698
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:26,000
of the, um, Mario maker streamers because I watched a lot more of those like Carl Sagan,

1699
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:32,480
um, Poop Grand Pooh Bear. Um, I remember the rest of them, but like, I know some of them by name

1700
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:40,880
just because I've seen a lot of their videos outside of GDQ, but, um, yeah, I don't remember

1701
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:47,520
a lot of them, but if I followed it more, which I'm bad about doing, um, then yes, it might be

1702
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:52,640
something I would. Yeah. But the point is, is that, you know, you have a lot of really,

1703
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:56,400
really great game players that participate in those types of charity events and so forth. And

1704
02:07:56,400 --> 02:08:01,040
it's just, it's just different now because you know, in the, in back in the day, we didn't get

1705
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:06,000
our news instantly from Twitch and the internet and so forth. You had your gaming magazine. So

1706
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:10,960
a part of the gaming magazine was trying to build up this cult of gaming celebrities and the

1707
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:15,680
squeakiest wheel who is doing it the most efficiently was Walter Day and the organization

1708
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:20,800
behind Twin Galaxies. And, you know, I don't think that should necessarily be discounted, but, um,

1709
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:25,520
you know, was it really accurately measuring who really was the best in the whole world?

1710
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:29,680
Probably not as well as we can look at that sort of things today, because it's much easier for

1711
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:35,120
anybody to be able to broadcast, but you know, it existed. It was a thing. Maybe gaming wouldn't be

1712
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:41,280
in the same place it was today without it. But the reality is if you don't evolve, you will fade

1713
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:46,000
away. And so if Twin Galaxies hasn't really evolved and honestly, I haven't really kept up

1714
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,760
with them, but I think, I think they are more like a celebration of, of classic games and kind of

1715
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:55,920
like a classic gaming corner. I think last I checked in on them, it was that type of thing.

1716
02:08:55,920 --> 02:09:00,320
Um, you know, or even take us here at Orange Launch Radio, we've been doing this show

1717
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:05,760
way too fucking long. Like we're coming up on 18 years of this program and we've only been on

1718
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:11,840
Twitch for maybe the past year. And in retrospect, we should have done it way fucking sooner.

1719
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:18,800
Well, we did though. And this, this is the other problem. Sometimes you evolve too soon and you

1720
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:24,000
don't really see the benefits of it because, uh, we were on Justin TV for a short time, but then

1721
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,600
it was like, this doesn't seem to be at, nobody's really into this. What are we doing? Whatever.

1722
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:32,320
We're going to get rid of it. And so we went back to the Google stadia. Yeah, we did. We did. And

1723
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:36,080
we were, you know, on shout cast for many years and, you know, it's continued to do the podcast

1724
02:09:36,080 --> 02:09:40,720
and all that, but now that we're on Twitch and so forth, I think we've been able to expand our

1725
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:44,400
audience a little bit within the last year. And now I'm kind of kicking myself going, we should

1726
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:50,560
have fucking done this three years ago, you know, but it, it didn't work out, but you know, we

1727
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:54,720
evolved too. I'm not trying to compare ourselves to twin galaxies, but I guess I just did.

1728
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:03,920
Anyway. So I've been talking an awful lot. Um, so what, let me ask, let me ask about your thoughts

1729
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:10,080
on this whole thing. So you recently saw the documentary. What's your take on this culture?

1730
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:15,600
Do you think that these guys have been lying to try to stay relevant or what's your take on all

1731
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:22,560
this? Well, I think, yeah, one really important part is that, you know, Billy Mitchell, his brand

1732
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:26,320
is, you know, part of his brand was, you know, that he was the record holder and, you know,

1733
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:32,800
he sells hot sauce, uh, for a living. So I think a big part of that, you know, part of his livelihood,

1734
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:38,720
I think was centered around that. And, and, uh, there was, I had also mentioned in the chat,

1735
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:44,480
there was that also kind of the other side, uh, um, it came, I think it also came out in 2007 was

1736
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:49,360
chasing ghosts. So I thought it was a really interesting juxtaposition of the two kind of

1737
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:53,760
positions of one guy trying to like break into that and all the stuff he ran into. And then

1738
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:58,880
the other one seemed to be just more of a documentary on their lives. And, you know,

1739
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:04,720
a lot of what came out of it was for me, at least was that you had all this urban legend growing up,

1740
02:11:04,720 --> 02:11:09,280
like you heard about Billy Mitchell because the internet never really, really knew what that

1741
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:15,440
meant. And, you know, so to hear the whole story now, um, I don't know, I just, I think it just

1742
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:21,280
kind of made him seem more human and just like all of us. And that's why it kind of, that kind

1743
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:26,000
of dawned on me that all these guys were just, you know, they had their egos that, you know,

1744
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:30,880
cause they were amazing back then, a lot of them, and then just the, you know, the thought that you

1745
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:36,720
could hold onto that record forever. I think it was, it's interesting. Cause I think back then

1746
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:40,560
you could, you know, or you could, at least it'd be really hard, but with the internet,

1747
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:46,560
you're always competing against someone. Um, like for instance, I was looking at the super Mario,

1748
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:51,920
uh, like the original Mario, uh, speed record and every, it seems like every week or every

1749
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:58,640
day they shave off point of a second or whatever that is. And it's just unachievable. So I just

1750
02:11:58,640 --> 02:12:04,640
think it's a crazy cross section of culture of this idea of trying to be the best. And maybe

1751
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:10,480
it's just not, you know, maybe it's not as glorious as it once was in the eighties because

1752
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:15,280
now you're literally talking about people that are going to be taking six months of their lives

1753
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:19,120
to just try to shave off these few millisecond to be at a world record.

1754
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:24,320
No, very good point. Um, you know, and I'm, I'm kind of also thinking about, you know,

1755
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:27,840
somewhat of the culture of the eighties and sometimes, sometimes kind of like,

1756
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:32,560
it takes a little bit of luck as well to sometimes be the one that's picked to be famous. And what I

1757
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:36,560
mean by that is like, if I were to use like an equivalent from the eighties, since we're talking

1758
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:40,000
about, you know, the twin galaxies and, you know, when all these records were going on,

1759
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:44,160
let's talk about like when MTV kind of first came out and started making all these musicians famous,

1760
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:49,360
let's take somebody like Madonna. Madonna was like the queen of MTV for a long time and some

1761
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:55,040
would argue still is, but Madonna, let's be real. Madonna is not the best singer, right?

1762
02:12:55,040 --> 02:13:00,000
But Madonna kind of knows how to play up the cameras and Madonna is kind of a great performer

1763
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:04,400
and Madonna knew how to play that role, especially in the eighties. I'm not really commenting on her

1764
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:09,600
now. You know, she'd been around forever, but Madonna in the eighties was great at being a

1765
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:14,640
celebrity. So in some ways, Billy Mitchell in a way embodies a lot of that as well.

1766
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:18,960
Billy Mitchell may not be the best, but Billy Mitchell embodied being a celebrity and kind of

1767
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:24,960
continues to do that in a way very well. Although as many people would say, Madonna kind of peaked

1768
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:29,040
a few years ago and it's been an interesting declines. I think a lot of folks would probably

1769
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:33,360
say the same thing about Billy Mitchell and so forth, but it's, it is very interesting.

1770
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:38,880
And even with music, you know, now a lot of people get music, they find people on YouTube.

1771
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:42,880
You know, it's like, that's how Justin Bieber got found, right? You know, and I realize a lot of

1772
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:47,040
people make fun of him and so forth, but the reality is he has a record contract and you don't.

1773
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:50,800
How did they find him? They found him through things like YouTube. And now it's all these

1774
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:55,120
reality shows, finding fucking people online and putting them front and center and so forth. So

1775
02:13:55,120 --> 02:14:01,840
it's just very interesting how, you know, a lot of that has just evolved and what makes a celebrity

1776
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:08,000
is very much changed. I want to read a comment here from Questbuster in our chat at twitch.tv

1777
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:12,560
slash vlog network, who says it's crazy how Mitchell and the retro scene blew up in the last

1778
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:17,440
few years. And so quickly, partially because of how accessible social media has made everything

1779
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:24,400
a 24 seven news cycle with a faster news cycle to stars can rise and fall almost as fast back in the

1780
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:29,680
80s and 90s. We just had magazines to tell us who the stars were, and they had 30 day reprieves

1781
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:34,400
until the next issue to see if they still retain their thrones. That's an excellent point. I think

1782
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:38,560
that's a good one to probably wrap up on. Any other thoughts, Rob, before we let you go?

1783
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:45,520
And actually the last thing, just you just reminded me of something. Is it even possible

1784
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:49,600
that he is great, you know, benefiting from all this attention now? Because he has a, I think

1785
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:55,200
someone was mentioning, he's got a Twitch channel now. And so could this all be like, isn't that

1786
02:14:55,200 --> 02:15:00,080
what they say? Like any controversy is good when you're at that level almost because now people

1787
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:03,360
are talking about even the fact that we're talking maybe is a good thing. I don't know.

1788
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:08,240
Absolutely. And I would bet you this, like, I'm not going to claim that this show has some gigantic

1789
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:12,880
viewership or listenership, but I'll bet you there'll be one person who listened to this,

1790
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:16,960
who go, Oh yeah, Billy Mitchell had a Twitch. I wonder what he's doing over there right now.

1791
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:21,920
And he'll go visit it. And I think it just goes to show, even if they're talking bad about you,

1792
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:25,440
they're talking about you and it's going to cause that curiosity. Or somebody is going to go look up

1793
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:30,000
the article on Wikipedia or somebody is going to see if he has a Twitter or something like that,

1794
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:34,240
because you're kind of bringing his name out there and people are going to be curious a little bit

1795
02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:38,480
about, you know, what's he up to now? And that's just, that's just the interesting part about how

1796
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:43,520
this all works. So absolutely. Why do you think he has kind of an on-off switch in his brain a

1797
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:47,840
little bit where, you know, again, and as I mentioned, I'm telling you, he's a pretty nice guy

1798
02:15:47,840 --> 02:15:52,880
off camera. But the minute the camera goes on, he's in, he's in camera mode and he knows the

1799
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:58,800
part he has to play to get you to keep being curious about him. Yep. That makes sense. Yeah.

1800
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:03,040
Well, thank you very much for answering all my questions and yeah, it's been great talking to

1801
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:07,520
you. I've been a listener for about 15 years in the background since my iPod mini, I think,

1802
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:12,480
is when I first downloaded it. So it's, yeah, it's nice to finally call in and yeah, talk to

1803
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:16,800
you for once. Well, wonderful to have you here. Thank you so much for your loyalty over the years

1804
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:22,320
and I wish you well. Have a wonderful night. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Yep. Take care. Bye-bye.

1805
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:26,880
All right. Great phone call. Wow. That was a long time phone call in the making too. Yeah. And see,

1806
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:32,480
that's, that's where we're succeeding tonight is places like Canada where the, they don't have

1807
02:16:32,480 --> 02:16:35,920
teams in the Super Bowl or there's no Canadian football. Well, I mean, I know there's Canadian

1808
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:40,080
football league, but there's no Canadian football teams in the NFL, right? You're asking the wrong

1809
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:44,960
person, right? I don't think there are. I think I would know if there was like a Vancouver team or

1810
02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:51,200
a Toronto team and I don't think there are. So, all right. Anyway, cool. You know, I thought he

1811
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:54,960
was going to say when I've been listening for 15 years, I started on my PSP. You know how many of

1812
02:16:54,960 --> 02:17:00,160
that I get that OLR PSP thing probably brought more. I always thought it was iTunes that brought

1813
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:04,080
the eyes to the show. And that one life, I think all our PSP probably brought more people to show

1814
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:09,360
than anybody else. That's crazy. So, well, it's too late now. Yeah. I'll never update it. All right.

1815
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:13,760
Well, that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio. Cause I don't think you

1816
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:20,080
didn't have any other last minute stories, right? No, not really. Then we'll go on to wrap things

1817
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:24,400
up. We're going to wrap things up here at orange launch radio. Thank you guys so much for listening

1818
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:28,160
in tonight, whether it was your first episode or you've been listening for 15 years, appreciate

1819
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:32,240
you being here either live or in the podcast form. If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange

1820
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:35,680
launch radio, tell a friend, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer

1821
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:40,560
has a voice. But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then we can't have them. And we love

1822
02:17:40,560 --> 02:17:45,360
to hear the interesting and diverse perspectives. So yeah, help us spread the word. A nice five star

1823
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:49,200
review goes a long way as well. iTunes, or I guess you can't really review things on Spotify,

1824
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:54,400
but you can share. So there is that. So I really appreciate that and all that support. We'll be

1825
02:17:54,400 --> 02:18:00,320
back in seven days to do it all over again. I keep thinking next weekend is Valentine's weekend,

1826
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:04,480
but it's not. We still have one more weekend in between. So, but for now we're going to wrap

1827
02:18:04,480 --> 02:18:08,240
up for the night and go around and give everybody's final thoughts. So, Loki, your final

1828
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:15,920
thought. My final thought is I can't wait to be over this cold. Oh, yikes. Feel better. I hope

1829
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:21,280
you didn't give it to me. No, I got it from my wife. It was, it was like almost like a flu thing,

1830
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:26,640
but I'm going through it a lot faster than she is. You sound fine too. I'm just congested. Like,

1831
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:34,240
I mean, I was fine today. And my final thought is I did my tax return last night and I'm getting way

1832
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:39,360
less money back than I have in previous years, which makes me a little bit sad, but oh well.

1833
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:44,480
That is what it is. So I hope I will cross my fingers and my toes that you all get,

1834
02:18:44,480 --> 02:18:47,760
at least those of you in America that have to do your taxes this time of year. I will cross

1835
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:52,080
my fingers and my toes that you all get some good news as well. Anyway, or at least better

1836
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:57,520
news than I did. That's it. We're done. Enjoy gaming everybody. We'll see you in seven days.

1837
02:18:57,520 --> 02:19:01,760
Have fun playing games and all that good stuff. Be nice to each other and support independent

1838
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:07,760
broadcasting. We will see you in seven days. Good night everybody. You've been listening to
