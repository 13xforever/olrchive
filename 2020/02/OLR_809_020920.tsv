14000	21000	This week, global concerns have reached gaming, affecting both market supply and distinguished international visitors, two very different situations created by two very different causes.
21000	27000	These are two pieces of turmoil in tonight's news, stay tuned for the rest, local and global, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	39000	Hello, my friends out there on the interwebs, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio.
39000	44000	Live tonight, episode number 809 for this, February the 9th of 2020.
44000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live with my co-hosts, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
50000	51000	Ye mortals beware.
51000	52000	Hi, how are you?
52000	55000	I feel dark and full of humors.
55000	59000	Okay, well good, I'm looking forward to a little sass on tonight's program.
59000	61000	I am full of many humors.
61000	63000	Well, hope everything's going well for you, my friend.
63000	64000	Mostly bitter bile.
64000	68000	Hopefully things aren't too bitter. Gaming is fun, darn it.
68000	70000	Chocolate is bitter and delicious.
70000	75000	What is your go-to feel-good video game? Like a video game you play when you want to feel good.
75000	80000	I'm putting her on the spot a little bit, so she probably has to think a little bit. I'm opening this up to chat, as well.
80000	87000	For what I have easily accessible right now, typically it's patterned, or I'll play Sims.
87000	88000	Okay.
88000	90000	Because I just want to build houses and forget the rest of the world exists.
90000	93000	Building swimming pools and taking away the ladder makes you feel good.
93000	95000	No, just building the freaking houses.
95000	96000	Okay, there's...
96000	100000	But patterned has kind of been like my unwinding game.
100000	104000	It's not necessarily like it's a feel-good, it's more of a feel-nothing game.
104000	110000	Because if I'm just really irritated with everything, and I play it, I can zone out and just not feel for a while.
110000	111000	Okay.
111000	112000	Makes sense?
112000	113000	Yeah, yeah.
113000	117000	Now, if I want to be really happy, then... I don't know.
117000	119000	Pinball.
119000	123000	There's something about the... I call them my zen games.
123000	124000	Yeah.
124000	130000	Minecraft is very that. Even though I don't talk a lot about Minecraft, I don't consider myself a Minecraft superfan or something.
130000	135000	Minecraft is a very zen game, or a game that's really filling that niche right now, No Man's Sky.
135000	137000	Yeah, I wouldn't say that it makes me feel happy.
137000	142000	I don't really have a game out right now that makes me feel particularly happy.
142000	143000	I see.
143000	146000	Not like Mass Effect or Dragon Age Inquisition did.
146000	148000	You know.
148000	153000	So right now, I mean, I'm sure I'll feel that way when Animal Crossing comes out.
153000	159000	Because I'll be really happy because I'm going to go around finding Ed and murdering him.
160000	164000	And I want Dina to be back. They have some new animals. There's new animals in there.
164000	169000	And they've replaced Joan with, I think, a younger turnip lady.
169000	171000	Why? Don't replace people.
171000	174000	Well, Joan was really old. I hope not.
174000	179000	But, I mean, maybe she and Resetson retired to the same animal retirement community.
179000	183000	Can you imagine if they started killing off the animal characters because they got too old?
183000	184000	Not killing them off.
184000	188000	Well, it's going to be like that episode of Sesame... I almost said Sesame Street.
188000	191000	Hey, welcome to Sesame Street.
191000	194000	Can you tell me how to get down the road?
194000	197000	So is it like they're going to have the animals like...
197000	198000	Oh, high-tech master Logan.
198000	200000	Retirement home or whatever and then like...
200000	201000	Torteurs are retired?
201000	205000	You're going to walk past it and all of a sudden the sign falls down and you see Glue Factory?
205000	206000	No.
206000	212000	No, I was thinking like that episode of Sesame Street when Mr. Hooper died and it was really sad and it scarred us all as kids.
212000	214000	But they didn't kill him off. He died legit.
214000	215000	Well...
215000	216000	That we know.
218000	220000	Dude, Mr. Hooper was great.
220000	221000	Yeah, I know.
221000	223000	And they handled it well.
223000	224000	They handled it excellent.
224000	229000	If you're like, you know, a little bit younger than us and that doesn't take much to be younger than us.
229000	234000	But if you're younger than us, I would really encourage you to like go look it up on YouTube, bring a Kleenex.
234000	237000	But like the way they handled it... Remember, this is a show for kids.
237000	241000	And the way they handled it was like extremely well done.
241000	242000	Right? Yeah, it really was.
242000	243000	It really was.
243000	247000	I mean, I was just like, gosh, hold on just a sec.
247000	248000	Keep talking about it.
248000	250000	I remember seeing it on TV. That's how old I am.
250000	252000	But anyway, OK, so high tech master Loki.
252000	256000	Let me let me toss the video games that make you happy.
256000	259000	So I will say this. I actually remember it. I was six years old.
259000	261000	I remembered watching the episode.
261000	264000	Oh, yeah, I was I was I feel like they reran it at some point.
264000	266000	I don't think I would have seen it when it was first first out.
266000	269000	But anyway, that was less sad. Let's talk happy.
269000	271000	So, Loki, video games that make you happy.
271000	273000	I have ideas on on how I'd answer this for you.
273000	275000	But what's your answer?
275000	279000	I mean, I don't know. It depends on who I'm playing with.
279000	282000	If it's myself, then I would just play.
282000	287000	I was playing Minecraft the other day and that was kind of fun.
287000	289000	If it's like with friends, it depends.
289000	293000	I mean, the best times that we had were modded Grand Theft Auto IV games.
293000	299000	I was expecting like a Grand Theft Auto or a Saints Row or something that's so obscenely buggy.
299000	303000	Saints Row? Well, Saints Row, like even like the third.
303000	312000	I think that's one of the things that they cut corners on and is multiplayer because they have like sort of a multiplayer mode,
312000	316000	kind of like a horde mode, because remember, that was what was popular back then.
316000	318000	And it kind of sucked.
318000	322000	But I did play it with friends and it was all right for what it was.
322000	330000	But it was it got it boring really fast, which is weird because like the first Saints Row game had some pretty awesome multiplayer.
330000	335000	And I can't remember the second one. I think the second one has a pretty good multiplayer as well.
335000	343000	But the first one, man, we played multiplayer and that probably more than anybody on the face of this earth played multiplayer in that.
343000	347000	Because we found out that we could drive the cars on the walls.
347000	355000	That's all he did. We drive it out the window, see if he could get the wheels on the invisible barrier and just drive straight up.
355000	357000	It was great.
357000	361000	M.M.O. is like, you know, Final Fantasy and stuff that I spend a lot of time with.
361000	363000	That makes me happy to like the social. Yeah, 11 was fun.
363000	366000	Yeah. Well, we all played 11 like for a long time. That was great.
366000	369000	You know, and that was definitely like a lot of happy moments.
369000	371000	I tried going back, but it's still not the same.
371000	377000	Like, even though it was like, you know, super fast, accelerated leveling, which is great.
377000	380000	Pax East is coming up very soon. Right.
380000	383000	I've I've stopped caring about the Final Fantasy 11.
383000	388000	It's never coming. I'm just I've I've made peace with it.
388000	394000	I know it's never going to happen. You know, so I just whatever.
394000	399000	It'll be like one of those things like a new half life game where when it finally does happen, it'll be like, OK.
399000	403000	Well, I mean, I'm over this now at this point, but go off, I guess.
403000	408000	Yeah. Anyway, let's go to our chat room. I asked you guys some of your feel good, happy games because we do tape live,
408000	415000	of course, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern over at twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network,
415000	420000	VOG Network, Voice of Geeks Network. And we do tape live right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights.
420000	424000	And let's see, Bobby Black Wolf, actually in chat, one of the first ones to speak up there.
424000	429000	Forza Horizon 4 right now will make me happy. Oh, a good a good driving game.
429000	432000	You know, Mario Kart is kind of a happy fun thing, too.
432000	437000	Until that fucking blue shell shows up, then it's less happy. Yeah, for sure.
437000	443000	Cool. Well, let's move on and talk about our official kickoff topic tonight, which is Nintendo adjacent somewhat.
443000	447000	And it's about a brand new Kickstarter that just launched this week.
447000	453000	Now, I think we had some kind of like rumors that this is going to be happening when we were taping last week.
453000	462000	But it was actually confirmed on the third that, yes, Platinum is going to be making a new version of the Wonderful 101.
462000	466000	It's a remaster, so it's not like they're completely redoing it from scratch.
466000	472000	But they are going to be doing this for the Switch and they have gone to Kickstarter to raise the money to do it.
472000	480000	They only asked for fifty thousand dollars. That strikes me as like not a lot of money to do a remaster.
480000	485000	So my thought is that they kind of already knew they were going to do it.
485000	491000	And this is kind of a fancy way of some sort to get preorders, I suppose.
491000	499000	Because that's essentially what it is, right? You back it on Kickstarter, you basically get your reserved digital copy of the game, right?
499000	503000	You paid full price for the game, but you're helping to make it a success.
503000	512000	And you can get blocked by Kamiya on Twitter as a thank you gift, which is the strangest reward I've ever seen on Kickstarter.
512000	518000	But okay, I get that that's a thing. But the stretch rewards are where things get really interesting.
518000	524000	So and it should be noted that they have already very much blown through the fifty thousand dollars.
524000	529000	Like they they they're already up to aren't they? They're up to are they up to a million?
529000	533000	I'm actually trying to see what they're up to as of the time of this show.
533000	540000	I'm waiting for Kickstarter to load over here. They are up to one hundred and sixty eight million yen.
540000	545000	So you have to do the conversion on that. So fifty thousand.
545000	551000	It's about one hundred and sixty eight thousand, one hundred and sixty eight million yen.
551000	555000	Now there you go. It's in the conversion. Just take off two zero five. Oh, it just did it.
555000	560000	One point five million dollars. It just updated there. So about one point five million dollars in Maria so far.
560000	567000	So some of the stretch goals that they are actually looking at doing with this, they're going to be doing ports on other systems.
567000	572000	So a steam version has been unlocked with two hundred fifty thousand dollars.
572000	576000	A PlayStation four version with five hundred thousand dollars.
576000	579000	Sadly, no Xbox or Xbox one listed.
579000	586000	But considering Xbox has historically had some challenges in Japan and this is a Japanese developed game.
586000	590000	I don't think we're terribly surprised to see Xbox being left off.
590000	595000	But we do see some new modes now. So now adding some things to the regular wonderful one on one game.
595000	601000	So they've already hit time attack and a 2D side scrolling adventure called Luca's first mission.
601000	608000	The next reward tier they're probably going to hit is a remix soundtrack featuring a secret special guest.
608000	613000	And then they have announced a two million dollar stretch reward for Luca's second mission.
613000	620000	So it's honestly by the time this thing all wraps up, they'll probably hit that too.
620000	624000	So I kind of ask you guys, what do you think about Wonderful 101 going to Kickstarter?
624000	629000	Because it just it strikes me as a little bit odd because it feels like they were going to do it.
629000	632000	But perhaps they needed to justify to somebody.
632000	637000	Maybe they weren't really able to find a publisher because, of course, the original Wonderful 101.
637000	641000	Maybe they need to kind of justify. We want to put this on PlayStation 4 and other platforms.
641000	647000	If Shenmue 3 can go to Kickstarter, then Wonderful 101 can go to Kickstarter.
647000	648000	I don't have a problem with it.
648000	652000	Fair enough. There has to be as terrible as Shenmue 3.
652000	656000	Shenmue 3 wasn't terrible. It was just really more of the Shenmue stuff.
657000	662000	But, you know, I can see how it would happen.
662000	667000	You know, every so often company, especially when you're dealing with a corporate environment,
667000	672000	they're not always going to have the vision of what fans actually want.
672000	674000	Only look at the bottom line, you know.
674000	679000	So they want to have the capital ahead of time to make sure that they're not going to lose anything
679000	684000	out on development costs so that they would have something that would guarantee to make more money back.
685000	688000	Bobby Black Wolf at Chat says, yeah, this was a PR stunt.
688000	690000	We're talking about it because of the Kickstarter.
690000	694000	So, you know, good point there is that, you know, here it is, free press for this,
694000	697000	that we're essentially talking about here on the show.
697000	699000	And many podcasts are talking about this.
699000	702000	And Twitter is all abuzz about it, social media, et cetera, et cetera.
702000	706000	And a large part of it is because kind of the unconventional sort of Kickstarter.
706000	711000	And maybe Wonderful 101 kind of, and I'm using my quotey fingers because I don't mean this literally,
711000	716000	like gets away with it because it was a little more of an underground game,
716000	720000	a game that people feel not enough people really got to play or know about
720000	723000	because the Wii U's audience was limited.
723000	726000	So it's kind of one of those things that feels a little bit more underground.
726000	730000	So it's like, yeah, I'm throwing money at this because I want these guys to succeed
730000	735000	because this is a little underground project even though, I don't know if I would call platinum games underground.
735000	738000	But don't get me wrong, I'm not like hating on the Kickstarter and this whole thing.
738000	746000	But it is fascinating that I bet if we talked about preordering most games at full price,
746000	749000	something that Blizzard does a lot actually,
749000	751000	we would give these companies a lot of crap about it, right?
751000	755000	Imagine no more are you going to go into GameStop and put down $5.
755000	761000	Oh no, you're going to put down all 60 upfront to get your copy of Final Fantasy VII.
761000	763000	Oh, I never said I was going to kickstart it.
763000	765000	Well, no, I'm just saying in general, in general.
765000	767000	And to be fair, and I'm sure somebody's already making this point in chat,
767000	773000	but you can put more money down towards the game so that way essentially by the time it's out,
773000	775000	you get it for free.
775000	779000	I don't know any retailer that's not going to be happy to take your money in advance
779000	782000	so they can invest it and make more money.
782000	784000	But I digress.
784000	787000	So I think most people kind of look at that and go,
787000	791000	that's pretty bold of a company to ask me to pay all this money before the game's already out.
791000	792000	Yet here we are.
792000	796000	This Kickstarter is asking for your money before the game is already out.
796000	803000	But most of us are not really batting an eyelash or, you know, pointing out this type of difference.
803000	810000	What is it about Wonderful 101 that they can, and again, I'm using my quotey fingers, get away with it?
810000	813000	I don't know. I never played it.
813000	816000	I will admit something that probably will not make me popular.
816000	818000	I did play it on the Wii U.
818000	822000	It was one of the games I used like Gamefly for a limited time I had it.
822000	825000	I used that to play Wonderful 101.
825000	826000	I didn't really get it.
826000	829000	It didn't really click with me.
829000	834000	But I also recognize that sometimes the first time I play a game I don't always get it
834000	838000	and then I'll come revisit it way after the fact and I'll fall in love with it.
838000	840000	Case in point, Mass Effect.
840000	844000	I played that when it was first out and wrote it off and then I came back years later and was like,
844000	845000	the F was I thinking?
845000	848000	So I'm not going to say, oh, it's a bad game.
848000	849000	It didn't click for me.
849000	852000	It wasn't something I was really excited to get back and revisit.
852000	854000	But that's not to say I won't ever.
854000	860000	But I'm not likely to put down 35 bucks or whatever it is they're asking to reserve a digital copy of the game.
860000	862000	I just don't see myself doing that.
862000	866000	But I'll be curious what this looks like when it actually does release.
866000	869000	I'm looking at some chats over in our chat room.
869000	874000	Obsolete Woman in Twitter, excuse me, Twitch TV slash VOG Network says,
874000	878000	Platinum wants to self-publish it so they probably want to show that there's enough interest to do so.
878000	882000	I'm a sucker for Platinum so I backed it immediately.
882000	889000	And I think that's a large reason why Blizzard has oftentimes gotten away with asking for the full price in advance.
889000	892000	They do it for Warcraft expansions all the time, right?
892000	895000	You could probably do it right now for the next Warcraft expansion.
895000	900000	Go put the money on that and you can immediately boost a character to maximum level.
900000	901000	And that's what you get right now.
901000	905000	And then you have your copy of the game on hold or whatever.
905000	906000	It's a digital copy so it's weird.
906000	911000	But you have it basically queued up, reserved, already bought for when the Warcraft expansion releases.
911000	913000	So Blizzard's been doing this a long time.
913000	915000	And I'm sure there's other companies too.
915000	919000	Nintendo, can't you go on Nintendo Shop and pre-purchase stuff?
919000	921000	You can pre-purchase stuff on PlayStation 4.
921000	924000	Usually it's only a couple weeks out.
924000	927000	They don't really turn on the pre-purchasing until it's pretty close to go time.
927000	929000	But it is something you can do.
929000	931000	So there's a lot of games that let you do it.
931000	937000	OrangeRight101 says,
938000	941000	I played Wonderful 101 thanks to Gamefly and I'm in a similar boat.
941000	942000	Couldn't really get into it.
942000	946000	It seemed like it would be cool if I did get into it a bit more than I did.
946000	952000	Anyway, even though I'm kind of saying, isn't this interesting how this is different?
952000	959000	I am very happy because I do know this game has its very passionate fan base and so forth.
959000	964000	And I think it is really cool that a lot of these games that got lost, so to speak, on the Wii U
964000	966000	are kind of getting a second life.
966000	968000	You know, Bayonetta 1 and 2 did.
968000	973000	We've seen plenty of the Nintendo titles like Captain Toad and so forth are getting the second life on the Switch too.
973000	975000	Why not Wonderful 101?
975000	977000	Just because it wasn't necessarily a game I got into.
977000	982000	You know what, clearly the success of this Kickstarter is showing that somebody out there is into it.
982000	985000	So I'm happy for them and all these folks.
985000	987000	But yeah.
987000	992000	But again, getting blocked by somebody on Twitter as a reward?
992000	994000	A little weird for me, but okay.
995000	998000	I was looking at the rewards because I was kind of curious.
998000	1000000	I was like, well, depending on how much it costs.
1000000	1002000	They had this amazing jacket.
1002000	1004000	They called it the Wonder Red jacket.
1004000	1007000	And it looked like a bright red bomber jacket.
1007000	1009000	And I was like, okay, that looks hot.
1009000	1014000	I would want that jacket, but it's a very expensive tier to get that.
1014000	1015000	I think it's already gone too.
1015000	1017000	I think a lot of people grabbed that right away.
1017000	1020000	I would guess that this thing tops out around 2 million.
1020000	1024000	Because most Kickstarters make the majority.
1024000	1026000	Maybe it'll go all the way to 2.5.
1026000	1027000	Maybe 2 and a quarter.
1027000	1031000	Most Kickstarters make the most money the first day and the last day.
1031000	1034000	And so are we about maybe a third of the way there?
1034000	1036000	Because it closes on March 6th.
1036000	1038000	So maybe we're barely getting started.
1038000	1042000	But it'll make a lot of money the last day as people kind of wait till the last minute to get there.
1042000	1045000	As they get money and so forth to get it in there.
1045000	1053000	But I mean, heck, even if it ended in five minutes, making 1.5 million, that's no small feat.
1053000	1057000	So congratulations to Platinum Games and everybody behind Wonderful 101.
1057000	1058000	And the fans.
1058000	1060000	I think it's great.
1060000	1064000	Akdeft in chat kind of closing a last thought on this here saying,
1064000	1067000	Yeah, I also have Wonderful 101 on Wii U.
1067000	1070000	And while I understand the appeal, it just wasn't for me.
1070000	1074000	I will say the game has that platinum charm and charisma.
1074000	1078000	Obsolete Woman says, I liked it on the Wii U, but wish it had touch controls.
1078000	1080000	You had to draw shapes with the analog stick.
1080000	1083000	And for most of the time, it didn't register the right shape for me.
1083000	1085000	Well, maybe it'll be interesting.
1085000	1086000	And I've heard that before.
1086000	1089000	How maybe some of that is going to port over to the Switch.
1089000	1093000	Because the Switch is obviously a very different type of controller than the Wii U was.
1093000	1095000	So it'll be interesting to see how some of that stuff crosses over.
1095000	1102000	And you can't just say it's going to be touchscreen because now it's going to be on the PS4 and the PC.
1102000	1104000	Was it touchscreen before?
1104000	1107000	Yeah, you had shapes and things like that.
1107000	1113000	Well, no, because I don't think you used the touch controls to do it because of the type of touchscreen it was.
1113000	1115000	It's been so long guys, sorry.
1115000	1117000	It was years ago that I played it.
1117000	1124000	But still, I think there were elements of it that used that second screen that are going to be interesting to see how it adapts over.
1124000	1127000	As it is with a lot of Wii U games.
1127000	1129000	So anyway, that's that on that.
1129000	1134000	Let's move on and talk about some of the games that we have been playing this week while we talk about our gaming weeks.
1134000	1136000	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1136000	1140000	It's been actually a very busy week for me.
1140000	1142000	So I've just been in my usual phone stuff.
1142000	1144000	I've been playing a lot of patterned again.
1144000	1149000	My goal right now is I actually completely started over on patterned on a different Mac.
1149000	1153000	So I can try to beat all the stages again and do it better.
1153000	1156000	And I've been getting more perfect stages, so that's been really good.
1157000	1164000	And then of course, you know, Animal Crossing, the dumb Harry Potter game, and dumb Pokemon.
1164000	1169000	Although I've been enjoying, now that I got a shiny Umbreon.
1169000	1174000	I don't know, it's just cute and I've been wanting to max him out on the buddy thing.
1174000	1177000	And I've done a few of the online battles, they're pretty fun to me.
1177000	1181000	And that's kind of it.
1181000	1188000	So funny enough, I woke up on Wednesday. Was it Wednesday? Yeah.
1188000	1196000	Because I had to be up for work and Dan had gone to bed after I woke up at 3.30 in the morning.
1196000	1200000	And I woke up and he was watching one of the Metal Gear games.
1200000	1206000	One of the ones with Raiden, not Metal Gear Solid 2, but the other one that had Raiden with his robot jaw.
1207000	1211000	I was like, it was the weirdest thing to wake up to because I wasn't quite awake.
1211000	1215000	And I'm like, Metal Gear? And Dan's like, Metal Gear?
1215000	1218000	Doing the David Hayter voice, it was pretty funny.
1218000	1221000	But that's just a little anecdote of gaming.
1222000	1226000	He also built tiny Lego pinballs. Oh really? Yeah.
1226000	1228000	One of his friends ordered him little pinball tables.
1228000	1230000	That's a thing? You can build pinball tables with Legos?
1230000	1234000	It's like a special kit. You know, they have lots of custom kits out there. I'll find out which one it is.
1234000	1240000	How big are they? Like, gosh. They're tiny. They would be the size a minifig could play.
1240000	1244000	Okay. Because you know what? I love my mini arcade games.
1244000	1247000	So why not some mini pinball tables to match?
1247000	1251000	It is maybe a hundredth of that size. Oh yeah, those are way too small.
1251000	1253000	It's minifig size. Never mind.
1253000	1259000	So look on your thing, people. She's talking about the Twitch TV channel.
1259000	1262000	Is that big? Now, flump.
1262000	1265000	She's making a little headcrushing. Because remember, we are a podcast.
1265000	1269000	And she's now making our wonderful camera autofocus on nothing, so it's all blurry now.
1269000	1271000	Oh yeah, you broke our autofocus, Jamie.
1271000	1273000	My bad. It'll fix itself.
1273000	1276000	Put your hand back up in front of it quickly. There we go. That should refocus it, hopefully.
1276000	1279000	Jamie, you broke the whole darn show. Good job.
1279000	1281000	Way to go. Hold on, ready? Way to go.
1281000	1284000	Now, I'm moving my hand. Drop your hand. Okay, we're good. Wow.
1284000	1286000	See? I fixed it.
1286000	1288000	Alright. Loki, how was your game?
1288000	1291000	Don't doubt my magical tech powers, yo.
1291000	1297000	I didn't play a whole lot this week. I just mainly played Orna. I'm up to 127.
1297000	1310000	And it's been mainly watching YouTube videos because I did discover a YouTuber channel by the name of Let's Game It Out.
1310000	1318000	And it's my type of way of playing games, so he plays games to intentionally break them in hilarious ways.
1318000	1324000	And I love it. Every single video I've watched of his is just endlessly entertaining.
1324000	1327000	So that's what I've been filling my week with has been that.
1327000	1330000	Now that I think of it, I did play a couple other things.
1330000	1341000	I did play Mr. Dew in the arcade a little bit because I've been posting on my Twitter that I've been going to this local 80s cafe.
1341000	1344000	You talked about it on the show last week, back to the 80s cafe.
1344000	1349000	But I actually went there, see? So I had actually eaten there now, and it's alright.
1349000	1353000	But yeah, it's got lots of stuff to play.
1354000	1362000	I'm not sure if it's legal to put this in your arcade, but they have one of those iCades.
1362000	1369000	I think it's an iCade. It's the 60-in-1 boards that's in some sort of machine.
1369000	1371000	I don't believe those are legit.
1371000	1374000	I was going to say, UltraCades were legit.
1374000	1376000	This is not an UltraCade.
1376000	1378000	Okay, alright.
1378000	1382000	But whatever, it's in there. Who's going to really complain?
1383000	1388000	So I did play Mr. Dew there, because out of all the other games that they had on there, I was like,
1388000	1390000	I don't want to play Pac-Man, I want to play Mr. Dew.
1390000	1393000	So I did that. And then, what else?
1397000	1400000	I don't know. My son wanted to play...
1402000	1407000	I think it was... I can't remember if it was Galaga or Galaxian.
1407000	1409000	I think it may have been Galaga.
1409000	1413000	Because he got one of those little mini-arcades that has it on there.
1413000	1416000	He's like, oh hey, that's a game that I've been playing all the time in my room.
1416000	1418000	So I'm going to play it on the actual cabinet.
1418000	1423000	He's like, this is much easier when the screen is much larger instead of a tiny little screen.
1423000	1426000	So he's been doing that.
1426000	1430000	And then, yeah, that's pretty much been the week.
1430000	1433000	I worked a little bit on my game this week.
1436000	1437000	That's about it.
1437000	1439000	Cool. Let's see, my gaming week.
1439000	1443000	So a lot of the usual suspects, all the various phone games, all of them.
1443000	1448000	And I've been playing Orna on the phone as well, as Loki has been.
1448000	1453000	I'm a little bit ahead of you, but you're gaining on me, so you're playing a lot.
1453000	1454000	I'm catching up.
1454000	1456000	The hardest part is, you can't...
1456000	1459000	And the thing that bothers me the most about the game is that
1459000	1463000	the people that have been playing it the longest and have had the chance to grind to the highest levels,
1463000	1466000	there's no way to take territory from them because they're too powerful.
1466000	1471000	So there's nothing to kind of equalize it so that newer players can get a footing in the territory battle part of it.
1471000	1472000	If that makes sense.
1472000	1475000	Haven't you found that that's a real hard thing to do, is to get territory?
1475000	1478000	Well, yes. Mr. Anti-Saint Mike, who is everywhere.
1478000	1483000	And then also has another character that's the ghost of Anti-Saint Mike.
1483000	1487000	I think the ghost is when you haven't visited for a while, so it's supposed to make it less powerful.
1487000	1490000	I think that's the mechanic they tried to put in, but it's not enough.
1490000	1491000	Yeah, the ghost...
1491000	1494000	I thought it was just... I put two max characters in.
1494000	1496000	No, the ghost is some type of game element.
1496000	1497000	Oh, okay.
1497000	1499000	So, I've been playing a lot of the usual stuff.
1499000	1501000	Final Fantasy XIV, of course. No Man's Sky.
1501000	1509000	But the game I probably spent a huge chunk of time with this weekend was the Fantasy Star Online 2 Closed Beta.
1509000	1511000	Finally, it's here.
1511000	1516000	You know, I have to... And I'm very excited that I got a chance to play the game, finally.
1516000	1519000	But I have to express a little bit of disappointment.
1519000	1520000	I just have to.
1520000	1524000	That it took this long for this game to come out here.
1524000	1532000	It's so frustrating that these companies feel there's not an audience for this type of stuff in the US.
1532000	1538000	And I get that money talks, and I get that it's based on projections and analysis and things.
1538000	1541000	But I just feel like it, especially because...
1541000	1546000	And I'm sure a lot of you have heard by now, the beta test went down in the first few hours,
1546000	1551000	because so many people were hitting the damn servers all at once, which always happens in MMOs.
1551000	1555000	Even though they knew how many people had signed up for it, because it was all through the Xbox insider perm,
1555000	1557000	still didn't stop that from happening.
1557000	1560000	I'm not holding that part against it, because I get it.
1560000	1563000	It's a frickin' MMO. These things always happen.
1563000	1567000	And they did make it up. They're doing some bonus time tonight that wasn't originally supposed to be in the closed beta.
1567000	1572000	But my point is, this should just be the proof that the demand was always there.
1572000	1580000	And I just feel a little let down by Sega that they didn't trust this audience sooner.
1580000	1589000	Because I know they had shown this game at E3 at one point, and then for whatever reason canceled it, backtracked on it, whatever they did.
1589000	1595000	That being said, I'm thankful that finally eight years later, we're finally getting a chance to play it.
1595000	1602000	Unfortunately, even though it is on the Xbox One, it does look like you're kind of playing a Playstation 3 game,
1602000	1607000	something that you could probably play on the Nintendo Switch, because of the fact that it's eight years old.
1607000	1611000	But for the most part, that's where my gripes about the game itself kind of end.
1611000	1614000	And it's not that an old game is necessarily bad or anything like that.
1614000	1615000	They couldn't remaster it.
1615000	1623000	I mean, so many people will still be going back and playing Smash Brothers on the GameCube, because that's the best version, right?
1623000	1626000	So I'm not saying just because it's older, it's a bad game.
1626000	1633000	I'm just kind of saying, look, this is a side effect of y'all not trying this a lot sooner, is that now the game looks a little bit dated.
1633000	1641000	I don't know if they did any remaster or anything like that, but in the closed beta, I didn't get a sense that it was top of the line.
1641000	1645000	It looked like Playstation 3, which isn't bad. It doesn't look bad at all.
1645000	1651000	But anyway, I don't want to sound negative on it, because honestly, I'm really jazzed and I'm really excited about PSO2.
1651000	1659000	It's like a faster version of Phantasy Star Online 1, and there's so many little tie-ins to the first game, a lot of similar areas.
1659000	1668000	But then it kind of branches off and does its own thing, and it kind of takes everything and puts a different little spin on it, because the boss fights are very different.
1668000	1674000	You can go into these fights now with like 20 people and take on a boss, as opposed to just like four, and it's pretty cool.
1674000	1680000	And it's fast paced. It's very fast paced, which is a little bit jarring at first, but once you kind of get the hang of it, it's really fun.
1680000	1686000	And so there's a lot about it, like I really like, and I'm excited for the game to release whenever they finally decide to do it.
1686000	1697000	So, yeah. Looking in chat, DJ Rama S says, also the ratings on the PSO2 anime also helped with the game coming to the US.
1697000	1706000	Pod Culture says, I thought it looked pretty good. Again, I'm not saying it looked bad. I'm just saying, when you wait this long, the game starts to look like a game that would have come out in 2012.
1706000	1707000	It looks dated.
1707000	1713000	Yeah. So, let's see. Pod Culture says, yeah, Fastly Star Online 3 will probably come out in Japan soon.
1713000	1717000	Well, I hope the beta test getting hammered so hard that the server is shut down or whatever.
1717000	1721000	I hope this shows Sega, you know, that there is more interest in this type of stuff.
1721000	1727000	And, you know, if they do have a PSO3 at some point, they put it out here a lot faster than they did PSO2.
1727000	1734000	The beta test was fun. The only kind of like bummer with the beta test, the way it was set up,
1734000	1740000	I don't understand why they showed that six ships were only going to be available and then they only opened two of them.
1740000	1743000	So, like a bunch of us had planned to go to ship three.
1743000	1746000	And since there wasn't communication about what that would actually...
1746000	1751000	And I'm kind of surprised that they didn't think that part through, that people were going to be coordinating.
1751000	1754000	Because they had talked about, oh, your characters are going to be able to carry over.
1754000	1760000	And if you do all these different, you know, urgent events, you can get a Dreamcast mag, which is a highly desirable thing.
1760000	1764000	And kind of made people burn through this content really fast.
1764000	1770000	I almost like, I'm going to be honest, I kind of wish they hadn't said that the characters would carry over from beta.
1770000	1773000	I kind of wish they said, we're going to nuke all your characters at the end of the beta.
1773000	1776000	I don't think anyone would have held that against them.
1776000	1780000	And I don't think, you know, because that's been done a lot of times in other betas.
1780000	1786000	And then that way when the game does come out, like people can reorient what ship they want to be on or what server.
1786000	1789000	And then can take their little time a little more with the content.
1789000	1794000	Because they won't feel the need to rush for some type of limited, exclusive Dreamcast mag.
1794000	1797000	Which they haven't defined. Is that even limited or exclusive?
1797000	1799000	Or something they'll just end up selling in the cash shop.
1799000	1801000	So, I don't know.
1801000	1806000	And again, I hate to sound really gripey, but these are some beefs that need to be pointed out.
1806000	1810000	Because I do think the way they rolled this out could have been improved a little bit.
1810000	1812000	Even for something that's a beta.
1812000	1817000	And you might be saying, well Rob, it's free. You didn't have to do anything for it.
1817000	1821000	Well, still. I mean, you want to set the game up for success, right?
1821000	1823000	Because we're cheering this game on.
1823000	1826000	Because we've been waiting so fucking long for this to come out in the US.
1826000	1828000	We want to see it do well.
1828000	1833000	So it does make some of those like, ooh, those winces of, ooh, I wish they'd done this a little better.
1833000	1837000	It makes it a little bit more like, oh, I just wish this had been done different.
1837000	1839000	But, anyway.
1839000	1843000	Bobby Blackwolf, who I know has been playing a lot of PSO2, is elaborating in our chatroom saying,
1843000	1847000	it looks like they have things that you can only redeem once per account.
1847000	1851000	So if they wiped your character, you'd lose those once per account things,
1851000	1853000	and they don't have the infrastructure to reverse that.
1853000	1858000	Well, why not? Reversing it, I can't see.
1858000	1862000	Because why don't they just issue everybody a new ID?
1862000	1866000	Because you have that PSN ID or whatever that you pick a name for.
1866000	1869000	I don't know. It seems like it shouldn't be that hard.
1869000	1877000	But, again, maybe this is a drawback of 2012 infrastructure and quality of life in your MMO,
1877000	1881000	versus all the progress we've made in the last eight years.
1881000	1884000	Which, hell yes, we've made a lot of progress in QOL in the last eight years.
1884000	1888000	Just look at a game like Final Fantasy XIV and how far that's come in eight years.
1888000	1890000	Well, that Switch port will fill right at home then.
1890000	1894000	So, anyway. Just a thought.
1894000	1897000	But overall, again, I loved playing the fast-paced thing,
1897000	1899000	and I'm excited to play this online with friends.
1899000	1902000	And, yeah, it is free. So there is that.
1902000	1906000	Hype Mayhem in chat says, too bad that PSO2 is only on consoles.
1906000	1909000	If it was on PC, I'd consider playing it.
1909000	1912000	Well, good news, Hype Mayhem. Only the beta was on Xbox One.
1912000	1916000	It will be coming out to Microsoft PCs.
1916000	1919000	I think there's some sort of deal with Microsoft.
1919000	1921000	Microsoft made it happen.
1921000	1927000	I think it has to be a Windows 10 PC, so you can't use a different OS or something.
1927000	1928000	I don't know.
1928000	1933000	Because Microsoft, obviously some type of partnership or funding or something made it happen,
1933000	1936000	so it is going to be a Windows 10 game.
1936000	1939000	But most people are probably running that.
1939000	1941000	Maybe it can be part of Games Pass.
1941000	1944000	Sorry to be Mac fans, but Microsoft did kick out money.
1944000	1945000	Games Pass?
1945000	1946000	Well, it's a free game.
1946000	1950000	I mean, if they put it on Game Pass, it would be a little bit redundant.
1950000	1953000	Maybe Game Pass people can get...
1953000	1957000	Yeah, like they do on PlayStation Plus for Apex Legends.
1957000	1959000	You get an extra skin and some coin.
1959000	1960000	You know, things like that.
1960000	1962000	So, there is that.
1962000	1963000	Anyhow.
1963000	1967000	Okay, that's my thoughts on Phantasy Star Online 2.
1967000	1969000	So, we're going to move into some gaming news.
1969000	1972000	First, I do have some housekeeping to take care of.
1972000	1975000	As I've been saying for a couple weeks, we are not going to be here live
1975000	1979000	at the Voice Geeks Network on March 1st and March 8th.
1979000	1985000	That is due to myself being on a cruise, so we won't be having a show live those nights.
1985000	1989000	We are looking at having a show that we taped in advance that will air on March 1st,
1989000	1992000	and then we will probably just take the week of March 8th off.
1992000	1997000	I don't know if one of my co-hosts might do an impromptu Twitch stream on their own channel in the interim,
1997000	2005000	but there will be no official OLR those weeks while I am tragically on a cruise ship in the Caribbean
2005000	2007000	hanging out with Star Trek fans.
2007000	2008000	What a tragedy.
2008000	2010000	Anyway, no show March 1st, March 8th.
2010000	2013000	Which is also my first cruise I'm going on as an adult.
2013000	2018000	So, I know Bobby Black Wolf is cheering me on because I think Bobby Black Wolf really likes cruises.
2018000	2022000	He's gone on several, and I know the engagement happened on a Disney cruise.
2022000	2027000	So, Bobby, I think, is very excited to hear all my cruise stories and what I think.
2027000	2029000	I just hope I don't get seasick.
2029000	2033000	Another piece of housekeeping I want to mention here towards the top of the show.
2034000	2039000	You know, I always talk about towards the end of the show that we need to support independent broadcasting, right?
2039000	2045000	Because, you know, indie broadcast and the folks that are in this, you know, because of the passion for it,
2045000	2048000	because of the love of this, we're all kind of like in this together, right?
2048000	2055000	Because we don't necessarily have all the coin, all the dollars, all the eyes on a big website that's advertiser backed and so forth.
2055000	2061000	You know, many of the independent audience does this out of the passion for it and out of the love for it and all of that.
2061000	2068000	And, you know, obviously one pretty amazing example of this that's going to be hitting a milestone tonight that I want to kind of say congratulations to and tip my hat to
2068000	2074000	is the folks over at Gamertag Radio, led up by Godfrey, and I know Paris hosts that show as well,
2074000	2081000	and I'm forgetting all the other names at the moment, but Godfrey and crew, I want to congratulate on 1000 episodes of Gamertag Radio.
2081000	2084000	That's a huge milestone to hit 1000 episodes.
2084000	2088000	Now, some of you might kind of, you know, I know some of you know that we have been around a very long time.
2088000	2095000	We do believe we are the longest running video game podcast because we kind of got the jump on everybody else since we started on Live 365
2095000	2099000	and then took the live thing into podcasting right away when podcasting became a thing.
2099000	2106000	But you know what? Here's the thing when it comes to, well, for one, they hit 1000 episodes first
2106000	2110000	because they do multiple episodes a week sometimes, especially during E3 week and so forth.
2110000	2116000	And I think this is another very important point, too, is that these types of successes should be celebrated.
2116000	2119000	You know what I mean? Like, you know, when you go to the office, right?
2119000	2125000	And let's say Karen in the finance department is celebrating 10 years with the company.
2125000	2129000	So we're going to have cake today. Yeah, you don't see someone come into the office and go,
2129000	2134000	well, I don't know if it was really 10 years. Does the six months she was a temp count?
2134000	2139000	You know, you don't do that because you celebrate those types of successes and things like that, right?
2139000	2144000	The more we celebrate and lift each other up, the more cake we all get to have. Right?
2144000	2150000	So I just wanted to say congratulations and enjoy your cake over at GamerTag Radio.
2150000	2156000	You guys definitely earned it. And honestly, it's a, you know, I've always kind of like encouraged
2156000	2165000	different voices and different people out there to get into podcasting because we need a diverse amount of voices out there.
2165000	2172000	And I don't see Danny and GamerTag Radio and the folks over there as any type of like competition or anything like that
2172000	2176000	because our shows are really fucking different. Like they're really, really different.
2176000	2185000	Yes. People know who he is. Whereas they don't know who we are. That's why he's got, was it the head of Microsoft?
2185000	2190000	Yeah, they have Phil Spencer. Yeah, Phil Spencer. We can't get Phil Spencer up in here. Let's be honest.
2190000	2199000	Well, but here, here's, here's the challenge. Have we really tried? And so I'll give God for his ups on that.
2199000	2204000	You don't know until you ask. He asked and asked and he got it. Good for him. That's great.
2204000	2210000	I hope when we hit a thousand episodes, when we're like, they'll be like four years from now on our weekly type of path.
2210000	2216000	I hope we're able to get somebody like, I would have loved to get Reggie Fils-Aime. I'll take Doug Bowser.
2216000	2220000	I bet he'll be, he'll be settled in and ready to go then. Or, you know, whoever is running games.
2220000	2228000	I'll take Tommy Tallarico. We'll talk about Intellivision for hours. I'm fine with that. I like people who like games.
2228000	2232000	That's also why I really like Phil Spencer. We'll get a person that runs a parody account for one of these big CEOs.
2232000	2243000	That's also why I really like Phil Spencer. And I kind of give him props too for doing this show because a lot of, uh, corporate gaming stuff really turns their nose up at podcasts and that whole thing.
2243000	2253000	Um, because podcasts unfortunately have that reputation of, Oh, what do you call four white dudes in their thirties in their basement on a Friday nights, a podcast, you know?
2253000	2261000	And I think those jokes are stupid and I think we should be inviting more people. We should be inviting more voices to this.
2261000	2269000	And so as I was saying, you know, uh, Gamertag Radio, they do a lot of like Xbox kind of focus things of the year. Not to say they're only about that.
2269000	2273000	Um, but they just play, they talk about different types of games. They play different types of games.
2273000	2278000	They, we talked a shit ton about Dance Dance Revolution on this show back in the day.
2278000	2286000	I don't think that's necessarily a game they got into over there, but I don't think we talk a lot about Halo and some of the big Xbox franchise.
2286000	2290000	We'll just get them hooked on Orna then their progress will slow down. It's fine, you know?
2290000	2302000	Yes. We're going to, we're going to send a mole over to Gamertag Radio. We're going to send a zit over to Gamertag Radio and just be like, have you guys checked out a game called Orna on the cell phone? It's really good.
2302000	2312000	Yeah. And then, no, but there's, there's places we overlap too. You know how, um, you know how they started? Um, not, not like the, the pre-Gamertag Radio stuff that Danny was doing before.
2312000	2318000	His original love was Phantasy Star Online. And he had like a Phantasy Star Online radio thing.
2318000	2321000	How, how wonderful for them to launch the beta in time for his...
2321000	2330000	Well, it's funny because when he talked about PSO2, I actually kind of sent him a direct message out of the blue and I said, I was kind of like laughing to myself because I'm like, Hey, you know what?
2330000	2340000	I think I see an area here where like our shows actually kind of have something in common that we both love Phantasy Star Online. And that's a, and that's a great thing. Let's celebrate that.
2340000	2349000	So anyway, uh, anyway, I've talked at length about that, but I really want to congratulate those guys on 1000 episodes and, and another, another big difference.
2349000	2356000	And why, you know, because again, folks have asked, well, since you guys are on longer, didn't you hit a thousand episodes first or, you know, things like that.
2356000	2365000	I, I, I don't know. I mean, this is episode number 809. And yes, we, we used to put out two episodes a week cause we take the live show and split it up as a podcast.
2365000	2373000	But again, um, I'm not interested in crapping on their success. I want to have cake. So let's celebrate it. Right.
2373000	2382000	And to be fair, you know, what we do, we are a live show. We've always been a live show. And then we kind of take that live show, crop it and put it on the podcast feed. Right.
2382000	2395000	That's how we do things. Okay. That's not the way they always do things. I think they do some things that may be like kind of live and, you know, but a lot of their episodes are edited and like put into a package and all that.
2395000	2404000	No, thanks. I don't have time for that. I don't have time to edit this show. And that's not the type of show. I'm not saying it's a bad show. Absolutely not saying that it's just not the show I'm doing.
2404000	2415000	So again, a great creative difference between us. And honestly, if you took the time to edit 1000 episodes, I fucking applaud you. Like that is, that is work. That is a lot of work.
2415000	2428000	And I think people don't realize how much work that is. So anyhow. Yeah. Bobby is in our chat saying Danny's first show on life through CC five was PSO radio. So he's in heaven this weekend.
2428000	2440000	Oh, I'm sure. Absolutely. Of course. Bobby Blackwell suggesting to bring on Jason Enos. You know, funny to talk about, not just DDR, but now he's like the VP over it in television.
2440000	2452000	So that really would be, we can have both. Why not just one person from intelligent can come on this show any fucking time. He likes, you see the seat right here. That's, that's the Jason honorary seat right there.
2452000	2464000	He come on this show anytime he wants. And, uh, we'll, we'll be happy to have him. He can even nap on that couch, which I have napped on many times when it was at my house, he actually would have been on the show.
2464000	2475000	About 10 years ago, if I hadn't completely fucked up the recording at E3. And that was, that was a learning experience. You know, that was a well shit, you know, type of thing. Hey, it happens to the best of us.
2475000	2488000	We've all learned something from the ups and the downs and so forth. Right. And isn't that what life's all about? It is, it is learning things. So, uh, active says editing anything is hard time consuming work. Hell yeah, it is. It really is.
2488000	2503000	So, all right. Anyway, big congratulations. And, uh, their thousandth episode comes out tonight and they are interviewing Phil Spencer. I'm not expecting any like bombshell news announcements. I suppose you never know, but I do know that Phil Spencer strikes me as the type of CEO that actually plays games.
2503000	2514000	And we've talked about this on the show before and is actually enthusiastic about games and actually, um, like is in kind of tune with gamers. You know, I think he's really got that more so than the guy he took over for, for sure.
2514000	2528000	Um, so I'm just excited to hear him talk to fans about games and loving games. And that's kind of how we started the show off tonight on a positive note. Right. So I hope their thousandth episode is just fucking celebrating video games. It's a great thing.
2528000	2540000	Yes. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. And, uh, we're gonna talk about some gaming news tonight and we're going to start, we're different sometimes, right? We're gonna start with a Sony story. Let's do it. Our first headline tonight about Sony.
2540000	2556000	So Sony has put up their official page for the PlayStation five and kind of even right before that GameStop had put up their pre-order page for the PlayStation five. And there was another retailer who also put up their pre-order page for PlayStation five.
2556000	2560000	You mean retailers want to take my money right now?
2560000	2571000	Right. They do. But I mean, the fact that they're doing that now is leads me to believe that maybe they know that there's an announcement forthcoming.
2571000	2583000	Um, so we will have to wait and see what, when that is, but I mean, it's not a surprise that, you know, that there's going to be an announcement at some point soon.
2583000	2595000	So we'll just have to wait and see when it is and what it is. And I don't know, in the meantime, we can stare at this webpage that has really nothing there other than the PlayStation five is coming and launches holiday 20.
2595000	2609000	Stare at that lovely PlayStation five logo. See if, see, I'm sure people are tearing this website apart, digging up the code, looking for hidden links, looking for any type of a thing that might give some hints away, but I guess nothing has turned up so far.
2609000	2614000	And you can even sign up on their mailing list.
2614000	2625000	But you know, the thing about those mailing lists always cracks me up, like the sign up for our mailing list thing, because no matter what it is, it's always on Twitter five minutes before that email goes out.
2625000	2632000	Right. Pretty much. Name a time when a mailing list actually broke a news story.
2633000	2640000	Once in a great while, I would say the when even when that happens, the email immediately ends up on Twitter.
2640000	2652000	Exactly. But, you know, the way if you want to talk about a recent story where an email broke a news story, that would be because they didn't really want it to be a news story, but they wanted everybody that was affected by it to know about it.
2652000	2658000	And that was when the ESA announced that, hey, our data has been breached.
2658000	2664000	How'd you like to lose some personal data? There was that wasn't there. Correct.
2664000	2670000	All right. But that's the point, you know, because no one reads emails that much.
2670000	2674000	It's a perfect way to just tell people without announcing it to the world.
2674000	2678000	Any predictions on how this PlayStation five roll out is going to go down? I have no idea.
2678000	2684000	I have a prediction. Sure. It's all going to happen on the two weeks we're not here.
2684000	2693000	Because if I've learned anything in the damn near 18 years of doing this program, it's all going to happen when we're fucking not here.
2693000	2698000	Yeah. And I can't even tweet because I'll be on a fucking boat.
2698000	2703000	Rob, what? I will do all the Twittering for you. Thank you. Appreciate that.
2703000	2708000	Do you have the OLR log in info? I hope so. Words.
2708000	2713000	Anyway, it's some letters and numbers and maybe a special character.
2713000	2718000	All strong passwords should be, shouldn't they? All right. And, you know, you have to sacrifice a chicken.
2718000	2723000	Anyway, PlayStation five news coming probably soon. I would imagine March would be like the latest.
2723000	2727000	We're going to hear about it. But yeah, anything. They could go all the way to June.
2727000	2732000	I mean, even who cares? I don't even care when they announce it at this point.
2732000	2736000	Just just let the launch titles be good and strong and let the console be great.
2736000	2740000	That's all I really want. The announcement, whatever. All right.
2740000	2747000	Moving on to talk about Twitch and Amazon. And this isn't news specifically about Twitch, per se.
2747000	2752000	But it's a little bit about what's happening because Amazon purchased Twitch several years ago.
2752000	2759000	Yeah. Right. And so what can that do to boost Amazon and have Twitch kind of boost Amazon in the portfolio?
2759000	2769000	Well, there was a report out there that indicates that Amazon might have some ideas on making money by selling Twitch's streaming technology to other companies.
2769000	2776000	Similar to how Amazon Web Services or AWS was the thing that was used internally in Amazon.
2776000	2779000	And now like AWS, like so many websites.
2779000	2787000	So I'm going to be able to tune in to ring doorbells or like whatever, you know, doorbell feeds or private security cameras.
2787000	2797000	Well, I would think maybe some of the things we traditionally know as cable channels might be the type of thing that end up going online, powered by a technology similar to Twitch.
2797000	2804000	I mean, after all, one of my favorite Twitch channels, and I'm sad it's gone, was that buzzer, the one that ran all the old game shows.
2804000	2809000	But for whatever reason, they pulled the plug on it. Probably still the Bob Ross channel, right?
2809000	2814000	Yeah, but even the Bob Ross channel only really runs Monday nights on special occasions. It doesn't run 24-7.
2814000	2820000	Yeah, well, I mean, you know, sometimes too much of a good thing might kind of like wear it out.
2820000	2822000	I think they wanted it to be kind of a special thing.
2822000	2824000	They should do something like ALF or something.
2824000	2826000	You want an ALF streaming channel?
2826000	2832000	Yeah, just because I don't really want to watch it, but, you know, it would be fun to tune in for a little bit.
2832000	2841000	Now, some folks are wondering if Amazon might be making a move like this because Twitch isn't bringing in the level of revenue that Amazon was hoping for.
2842000	2853000	So apparently Amazon brought in about, excuse me, Twitch brought in about $300 million, that's still a lot of money, to Amazon in 2019, but the forecast was $500 to $600 million.
2853000	2865000	So I don't know why the bar was set so high. I don't know if losing some of the personality competition caused that, but I just, maybe, that just sounds like maybe really aggressive. I don't know.
2865000	2875000	So maybe Twitch needs to explore other ways to be able to be profitable, although that means, you know, you guys spending more of your money.
2875000	2881000	But I like the idea of like tie-ins with games to like click here now to add to your Amazon cart and things like that.
2881000	2890000	And I realize that kind of exists to an extent, but like the technology isn't there for me to like update something like as we're going and as we're talking about a certain game.
2890000	2897000	Like when we talk about Wonderful 101, click here now to, well, I guess that's a Kickstarter, not a Amazon thing, but still something akin to that, right?
2897000	2903000	We talk about a game. I should be able to like update something where you can click now in order to buy it if you want or something like that, you know?
2903000	2913000	And it's a little hard to do on the way the structure is right now. But then again, I also realize we're a niche thing. We're not Ninja or anything like that. You know, it's very different. I don't know.
2913000	2920000	So anyway, no idea what the timetable looks like or even if Amazon is actually going to do it.
2920000	2926000	But this is something that could be helping Twitch make some money for Amazon in the near future.
2926000	2933000	So it could be interesting because who knows what other gaming companies maybe would want to grab onto something like this for their own type of broadcast thing.
2933000	2942000	I don't know. I would just think everyone would just use Twitch. I can't imagine that like we really need another platform dedicated to something.
2942000	2951000	Okay, I'm gonna put my tinfoil hat on because you know who I think would do it if they were able to like make their own type of thing that wasn't just embedded within Twitch? Nintendo.
2951000	2960000	I do. I don't know why. I wouldn't watch it. I don't know. Oh, please. Oh, please. So many people tuned into those Nintendo Directs.
2960000	2968000	There are huge things. The treehouse lives and everything that they do. I don't understand why you would need your own platform. Just put it to be branded.
2968000	2981000	Brand your own goddamn page. You don't need to have like your own separate platform that's basically the same thing. Stop. I don't know. I kind of think I just see Nintendo as the company.
2981000	2993000	Of course they would because if it's got to be difficult, it's got to be Nintendo. Seriously. No. Let's do things differently and also a decade behind.
2993000	2998000	I swear to God. Let's move on. Dark Sakura.
2998000	3005000	Whale. Everyone is losing their shit over a virus.
3006000	3014000	I'm sure everyone is seen on the news though on coronavirus specifically that particular strain because hello people.
3014000	3021000	The common cold is a coronavirus that's massive and multiple tiered and the flu kills more people.
3021000	3033000	Now that I've been preaching about that. Can I jump in, though? Because I mean, like I understand, like, yes, the media and a lot of social media and people are kind of like running away with it and acting all crazy.
3033000	3040000	And especially people that want to like make jokes that are that are rooted in racism. Very racist. Like that. That's all shitty.
3040000	3051000	And I'm totally on board with that. But like I also there's also part of me that's like but the way they've been able to contain it as well as they have is because they're taking it seriously and because there is that type of alarm.
3051000	3059000	And because there are folks that are working very hard, disease center controls and things like that that are, you know, working hard to prevent this from getting worse.
3059000	3068000	Yeah. But at the same time, people shouldn't the every day average person doesn't need to freak out about it.
3068000	3069000	I'm on board with that.
3070000	3091000	OK. You're not going to have the cross contamination meat that's give that originated this virus and your next door neighbor who might be from some Asian country isn't going to magically sneeze Wuhan coronavirus on you because thinking that is racist as fuck.
3091000	3099000	I agree with all that. But I think it is also good to remind the general human population no matter where you are. Please wash your hands after you poop.
3099000	3105000	So this isn't this isn't the ancient Chinese secret that I've been hearing about. No, that's Calgon.
3105000	3112000	Oh, but I think I think good good hygiene is a good thing to practice. Please wash your hands after you poop.
3112000	3126000	Yes. At any rate, of course, it has been, though, affecting the technology industry pretty crazily because a lot of manufacturing is done in China and in Taiwan.
3126000	3135000	Now, I'll go ahead and also say this. One of my friends was supposed to be going to Taiwan this week and her flight to Hong Kong actually got canceled due to this as well.
3135000	3143000	She had to reschedule. But I am. It's also affecting things like shipping and travel and all of that.
3143000	3156000	The crews I'm about to go on. They sent out an email that says, we're sorry, but if you have travel plans that have put you in China 15 days before the cruise, we're not going to be able to have you on the cruise.
3156000	3160000	Please talk to us about rescheduling, you know, a very nice customer service email.
3160000	3166000	But it's just like, hey, sorry, but we have you know, it's affecting like a lot of stuff and including video games.
3166000	3170000	Well, and of course, one of the biggest companies affected by that right now is Nintendo.
3170000	3177000	They actually have a statement on how on the Web site about how this is affecting their workflow.
3177000	3188000	And I'll read the quote. We can confirm the manufacturing of some Nintendo products for the Japanese market has been delayed due to the impact of 2019 and COVID coronavirus outbreak.
3188000	3198000	Nintendo does not anticipate a significant impact on our broader global supply systems and accessories at this time and product sales in North America and Europe, including preorders are not affected.
3198000	3204000	We'd like to express our concern and support for all of those affected by the coronavirus during this challenging time.
3204000	3218000	Also, a private division publisher say that they are delaying outer worlds on Nintendo Switch due to the impact to the Virtuos team working on the port to give them enough time to finish development.
3218000	3222000	And they will be releasing a physical version on cartridge.
3222000	3229000	So any other any basically everyone's like, oh, our teams are fine, but all this other stuff is happening.
3229000	3236000	No word from Sony or anything from Microsoft yet.
3236000	3246000	People have requested they haven't said anything. But again, as I brought up a few weeks ago, the sales of Plague Inc have been skyrocketing.
3247000	3254000	And nothing about how this is going to affect the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.
3254000	3256000	And so, yeah.
3256000	3263000	Well, and hopefully at the end of the day, the measures that they are taking do really help prevent the spread of this.
3263000	3271000	Have they said if it's one of those things like H1N1 or what was called the swine flu, where it got weaker as it went on?
3271000	3274000	I haven't seen anything about that. I'd have to look back into it.
3274000	3275000	That was my hope.
3275000	3284000	But I do know that the origination of this apparently came from cross-contamination due to people mixing bat meat.
3284000	3285000	Oh, wow.
3285000	3294000	Yeah. Into you know, that it was getting into like the butchering or something or in the grinding of the meat, that it was very poor conditions where the meat was being processed.
3294000	3298000	And of course, some people were eating it and bats themselves.
3298000	3300000	I mean, I love bats. They're cute. Don't get me wrong.
3300000	3305000	They serve a purpose in this world, especially in America, that they do carry rabies pretty badly.
3305000	3314000	And they are very prone to carrying disease that do not affect their population, but are highly terrible.
3314000	3322000	That's not what I'm quite thinking of, but highly communicable if ingested or if they're bitten, if a human is bitten by them.
3322000	3325000	So including rabies, including other bloodborne illnesses.
3326000	3329000	It's one of those things where it's like feline AIDS.
3329000	3335000	And what we know as humans is the AIDS virus are very, very different and they are not actually the same thing.
3335000	3341000	There are similarities, but like you cannot get that from a cat and a cat cannot get that from you.
3341000	3345000	Right. I think we're, I hope we're all educated on how that all works now.
3345000	3349000	It's far more communicable among cats, between cats than humans.
3349000	3352000	Just saying, especially, you know, you can't give prep to cats.
3352000	3353000	True.
3353000	3354000	You know, just saying.
3354000	3356000	Anyway, so...
3356000	3357000	Not yet anyway.
3357000	3359000	That'd be nice, wouldn't it?
3359000	3363000	But at any rate, back to this.
3363000	3365000	So there's going to be some delays.
3365000	3374000	Keep your eyes out on not just the console area of things, but look in your other technology as well for other distributors.
3374000	3382000	And major manufacturing is done in that whole APAC region, Asia Pacific region.
3382000	3384000	So, there you go.
3384000	3391000	And, you know, as frustrating as it might be to see some things get delayed and such as a result, have some fucking understanding.
3391000	3393000	Like, put things in perspective.
3393000	3400000	At least you weren't on that cruise ship that they had to all sit there for two weeks and wait it out, you know, or you're in the city of Wuhan,
3400000	3407000	which, you know, apparently life is very different there right now because of, you know, how isolated it is and so forth.
3407000	3409000	So just be glad it ain't that.
3409000	3412000	And Questbuster does make a good point. I'll just read the quote here.
3412000	3421000	One thing I noticed when I traveled in China is that you have high-tech cities mixed in with extremely rural open-air markets that sell ellipsis anything.
3423000	3424000	So...
3424000	3425000	Alright.
3425000	3429000	Well, let's move on. Let's talk about some other gaming headlines in the week. Loki.
3429000	3437000	Yeah, so there was this streaming service that Nvidia is putting out that they finally have made live.
3437000	3445000	It's basically their, I guess, not really an answer to Stadia or Xcla or something like that.
3445000	3453000	But what you're able to do with this is actually stream games to different devices that you may have in other libraries.
3453000	3458000	So they're not actually providing the games like you would with Stadia.
3458000	3471000	It's basically using, like, your Steam, Epic, good ol' games and Blizzard accounts to link those together to be able to stream some of the games you have purchased there to those devices.
3471000	3475000	So I don't know what compatible games they have available right now.
3475000	3480000	I wanted to check it out, but sadly they do not have iPhone support. It's only Android support.
3480000	3489000	I could have borrowed Alan's tablet maybe, and maybe I will still do that during the week, but I wasn't extremely motivated once I heard I couldn't use my own phone to do it.
3489000	3494000	But I love the idea that it connects to games that you already own, so I'm like, buy them again.
3494000	3496000	Because I have quite the library.
3496000	3497000	I know, I know you do.
3497000	3500000	That would have been nice if Stadia used the Steam account.
3501000	3508000	Well, it's interesting to see that other, you know, I don't think a lot of us have talked very seriously about NVIDIA being a big player in games and so forth.
3508000	3514000	But I mean, certainly this is one of those things you look at and then you kind of go, well, why doesn't Google do something like that?
3514000	3515000	This is going to be...
3515000	3523000	Yeah, so they're saying, though, for bandwidth, what you would need to kind of run this, they say 50 megabits down for the best experience.
3523000	3533000	They're recommending 30 megabits down for 1080 at 60 frames per second, or 15 megabits down for 720 at 60 frames per second.
3533000	3537000	So that's not all that bad.
3537000	3543000	I mean, honestly, I'm not really sure how that compares with Stadia, but it doesn't seem too demanding.
3543000	3549000	Right now, you can check it out with a free account, which will allow you to play an hour at a time.
3549000	3552000	And then, of course, it'll be queued if it's busy.
3552000	3564000	Otherwise, if you pay $5 a month, you'll get up to six hours of gameplay at a time, ray tracing in games that are streamed to your device, priority access.
3564000	3580000	Interesting. I do kind of want to check it out since I do own Android devices and other devices that are not as powerful.
3580000	3588000	I have a Surface that would be fun to stream stuff to. Maybe my son wants to play a game or something like that.
3588000	3593000	Yeah. I'll have to check it out.
3593000	3602000	Well, moving on to talk about another game coming out from Valve, or excuse me, that's out from Valve called, of course, Counter-Strike GO.
3602000	3609000	I think Counter-Strike's kind of a, or CS GO, for sure. I don't know, but Counter-Strike GO, obviously, there's a very popular franchise and so forth.
3609000	3613000	This is a new moderation system for the game that's going to really change things a little bit.
3613000	3623000	Because if you are somebody that is consistently getting reported for abuse, even beyond an initial warning, so let's say you get warned and players are continuing to report you.
3623000	3630000	Well, what's going to happen? You will be muted by default. So when you go into other games, people are just not going to hear you.
3630000	3633000	You'll be screaming at nothing because you have been muted by default.
3633000	3640000	Now, players can voluntarily unmute you, so you can't say that you're being robbed of being able to play with friends and stuff like that,
3640000	3649000	because people can still unmute you as they wish, but if you have continued to get complaints about you after you've already been warned, you'll be muted by default.
3649000	3659000	Until, now, you're not going to carry this, you know, badge of shame forever, you can earn some XP, and once you earn enough XP, you will get rid of the penalty.
3659000	3668000	In announcing this, the Counter-Strike GO team said, because the new system is driven by reports, it lets players establish their own standards for communication,
3668000	3673000	and ensure that their fellow players receive anonymous feedback when they're out of line.
3673000	3682000	Don't know how I feel about that, because I feel like that leaves the, we're going to let our players establish the standards. It feels like it leads the door wide open.
3682000	3684000	I don't want responsibility, Valve.
3684000	3688000	We don't want to pay anybody to moderate. We're going to let the community have a side.
3688000	3696000	Why would we do that? It's worked so well on our store platforms, just letting every, let the community moderate that. That's worked out great.
3696000	3700000	So that's where this news story gets a little bit like, ooh.
3700000	3706000	But you know, when you look at it though, it's really not that strange. It's totally a page out of the Valve playbook.
3706000	3713000	You know, fuck our responsibility. We'll give you the tools and you guys build your fucking structure.
3713000	3724000	Now, Valve is not saying how many reports you have to get before you get a warning, but they will say that those who play frequently and don't report often, they carry more weight.
3724000	3731000	So if you're somebody that goes on and reports three people in every game, your report doesn't weigh as much as somebody who very rarely reports people.
3731000	3737000	Because it's one of those things where it's like, oh, well, if you rarely report people, then you must only do it when it's really bad.
3737000	3739000	That also doesn't make any sense.
3739000	3740000	I know it's like this secret formula.
3740000	3742000	That doesn't make any sense because that's like.
3742000	3744000	Like the fucking KFC recipe.
3744000	3750000	That's almost like, you know how, remember they have the YouTube moderator groups or whatever that were supposed to like review content and stuff.
3750000	3754000	So they're penalizing you for doing their job.
3754000	3760000	And they do go on to say accounts that generate no XP or, and they have spam reports or something like that.
3760000	3763000	They will have little to no impact.
3763000	3769000	So very interesting to see how this all boils out with this magical formula that Valve's created.
3769000	3777000	But, um, I don't know. I, it just, I feel like there's going to be a follow up to this very soon about how this was abused to mute certain players.
3777000	3779000	So we'll see.
3779000	3780000	I can't wait.
3780000	3784000	I just hope that isn't it because I just, I feel like I see the punch line.
3784000	3785000	I'm using my quotey fingers again.
3785000	3786000	I'm using those a lot tonight.
3786000	3788000	I feel like I see the punch line to this coming.
3788000	3795000	And it's going to be that like somebody whose voice should be lifted in a multiplayer gaming circle is going to instead get silenced.
3795000	3800000	And I really, really hope that doesn't happen here.
3800000	3805000	But I'm just going to say if we're reporting on this again in six months, I'm not exactly going to be surprised.
3805000	3807000	But I guess we'll wait till then.
3807000	3808000	In the meantime, maybe we'll be surprised.
3808000	3809000	It'll take that long.
3809000	3814000	In the meantime, let's talk about a pleasant surprise, an actual pleasant surprise.
3814000	3815000	Dark Cyber.
3815000	3819000	This is something that is definitely a little bit happier in news.
3819000	3828000	And we hinted at this when we had our come over from Bobby, when he handed the reins back to us.
3829000	3837000	There is going to be a Western release of Double Dragon and Kunio-kun Retro Brawler collection.
3837000	3844000	That is a PS4 Nintendo Switch collection going to be out on February 20th.
3844000	3854000	It was released in Japan as Kunio-kun, the world classics collection, has basically a series of 18 games from that series,
3854000	3859000	including three of the NES versions of the Double Dragon games and a bunch of the Kunio games.
3859000	3868000	What's going to be the big thing about this, though, is that a lot of the Kunio-kun games are actually never,
3868000	3876000	they're never localized versions, 11 of them that have not been their original localized versions.
3876000	3881000	So we are going to be getting, so while we had River City Ransom and that will be included,
3881000	3886000	we also get Nikketsu Downtown Story, you know, so that's going to be one of them.
3886000	3891000	That's amazing. 11 games getting localized for the first time. That's amazing.
3891000	3896000	That's great. I mean, a lot of these, I mean, shoot, we had to import some of the ones or romp them.
3896000	3898000	There's probably ROM patches out there somewhere, yeah.
3898000	3906000	For sure. But as far as the list, hold on, I just had that list a moment ago.
3906000	3912000	This is terrible because now the list doesn't want to pull up. OK.
3912000	3918000	Yeah, it's not showing me the list of them, but I mean, there was like, you know, Super Dodge or not Super Dodgeball,
3918000	3923000	but, you know, Dodgeball. We had like the hockey games.
3923000	3931000	We had Nikketsu Fighting Legend. Just a lot of those on there.
3931000	3939000	But I mean, Nikketsu High School Dodgeball was what we had a Super Dodgeball and, you know, Renegade and crashing the boys.
3939000	3945000	Is the drummer a boy too? No, sorry. I love that movie. But yeah, so it's going to be really sweet.
3945000	3949000	Dan and I are pretty excited about that, you know, and barf.
3949000	3954000	Heck yeah. No, this is great. It's again, it's one of those things where it's like this.
3954000	3959000	I wish we'd gotten localized versions of more of these games a long time ago,
3959000	3964000	but I'll take what we can get. Maybe, maybe that collection of mana and trials of mana.
3964000	3970000	Second, it's a three finally being localized after all these years. Maybe that set off some interesting trend.
3970000	3975000	I don't know. I don't know what it is about all these older games suddenly getting localized, but I'm here for it.
3975000	3980000	It's about time. The big thing I think is that they're realizing is that, well,
3980000	3985000	you can't keep things hidden from us, not with the Internet, the world we live in now.
3986000	3989000	We're way too connected. I mean.
3989000	3993000	I mean, people get pissed off when stuff doesn't get localized now, you know,
3993000	3998000	or at least some kind of translation for it. So.
3998000	4001000	I'm excited. I'm pretty happy about it.
4001000	4006000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I think there's arcade versions on this, too. Yeah, I believe so. That is correct.
4006000	4010000	Quest Buster says, Yeah, this sounds pretty wild. Great to see this coming out.
4011000	4015000	Big thing is we're willing to give them money to play these. I mean, we always have.
4015000	4021000	So, yeah, they need to keep that in mind. So, well, you know, and we need to make sure we do give money when these games come out.
4021000	4025000	I know I'll be buying it. I'm very excited about that. I love I love retro games.
4025000	4030000	I love the idea of playing some of these Kunio-kun games that I have never gotten to play before because I'm just I'm quite frankly,
4030000	4033000	too lazy to deal with ROM translation patches and all that stuff.
4033000	4039000	I think I only ever did that to play second. It's a two three the first time and Final Fantasy five.
4039000	4041000	I think that I think I remember that from years ago.
4041000	4045000	I don't know how many of you guys were old enough to remember that when Final Fantasy five was a translation patch.
4045000	4050000	It was a big deal. I had my my ROM forever with butts.
4050000	4053000	Yeah. Wasn't his name completely different? Yeah.
4053000	4061000	This is like Batsu. But you could say Bart's or butts or Batsu.
4061000	4066000	So, yeah, I think like after a while, one of my later times playing it through,
4066000	4070000	I ended up just naming him Batsu like in rival schools.
4070000	4073000	So. All right.
4073000	4078000	I'm moving on. Let's go to a couple more stories before we get to the classic game of the week.
4078000	4084000	We'll get to that in a minute. All right. Let's talk about how generous EA is.
4084000	4090000	They've decided that they're going to go ahead and raise the prices of a bunch of their games on the steam storefront.
4090000	4094000	These games, if you're in the US, you might not know it's a price hike.
4094000	4101000	But in other regions like UK, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico and other regions,
4101000	4109000	you're seeing price hikes, even some of them more than double the original price.
4109000	4116000	No reasons have been given so far as to why these have been increased because they want you to still use origin.
4116000	4122000	As I say, it should be noted that origin still the lower price, but.
4122000	4128000	OK, just wait for a sale. But for those of you that must have it on steam, you can just pay more for it,
4128000	4132000	because that's what they're deciding to do in this case. Wait for a sale.
4132000	4140000	Yeah. Just don't give them your money. Rip cycled in chat says, reminding everyone to hate EA.
4140000	4147000	Don't like really need to remind you, but it's, you know, it just for in case you forgot for some unless you needed more reasons.
4147000	4153000	Yeah. Well, I mean, I can also kind of see I mean, like from a completely like corporate perspective,
4153000	4159000	I do understand why you would want to price it lower on your own store. It's just not a good look.
4159000	4165000	Yeah, especially when it's like double. I mean, like maybe a 10 percent or a five dollar difference or something like I get that.
4165000	4170000	But double. Mm hmm. It's crazy. All right.
4170000	4176000	Well, let's talk about steam of a different type. And this was a story that was actually posted in our discord.
4176000	4181000	So sometimes you guys share stories with us on our discord server and we read some of them on the show.
4181000	4185000	So I do want to invite you all to join us on discord over at vog network dot com.
4185000	4191000	That's VOG network dot com slash discord. That'll get you the invite that you need to get on our discord server.
4191000	4195000	And we had a link posted about this story about steam China.
4195000	4200000	And I didn't even realize that there was like a unique version of steam coming out in China,
4200000	4205000	which this article gets into is mostly like it sounds like it's a good thing,
4205000	4211000	but what's actually happening might not be so good because apparently as it is right now,
4211000	4216000	steam is a bit of a loophole in that firewall that China has.
4216000	4222000	You guys have all probably heard about this, right? That China has this big firewall that a lot of websites are blocked.
4222000	4227000	And you can't get into things like Google, Facebook, Twitch. So you can't watch the show in China live.
4227000	4233000	I don't even know if you can get the podcast, but who knows? But you can use steam.
4233000	4241000	So for many people, you can get into things like Grand Theft Auto five player, unknown battlegrounds and all this stuff.
4241000	4248000	But now if steam China becomes a thing, you won't necessarily be able to get into these things.
4248000	4254000	It's only going to be able to sell games that are approved by China's licensing and censorship policies.
4254000	4261000	And the group that may suffer the most from this, indie developers in China, of which there's not a ton of them.
4261000	4266000	It's kind of a different way it's all set up there just because of the culture and so forth.
4266000	4276000	But China's indie scene would suffer because they may not have the resources to put their games through this type of review system to get approved.
4276000	4285000	So while a localized version of steam might sound like a great thing, it is interesting to kind of see the other side of this.
4285000	4294000	Now, DJ Powers from Valve in an interview with Eurogamer said that nothing will change regards to steam being available in China.
4294000	4301000	And that kind of went on to elaborate that the goal of this is to make sure the players will still have access to the library of games that they've got.
4301000	4309000	But some developers are saying steam China is terrifying. It's horrible. I'm not sure it'll be but I hope players can still access international steam.
4309000	4316000	If steam wasn't available, we wouldn't be doing this. I think that's probably the case for most developers in China.
4316000	4322000	So we'll see what develops with the launch of that and how it might affect the industry over there in China.
4322000	4329000	All right. Well, let's take a trip down memory lane. And this is the part of the show where we're going to visit. We're going to visit a classic.
4329000	4335000	We're going to visit something from the past, something that you can't get on steam. Actually, maybe a version of this.
4335000	4336000	Maybe not anymore.
4336000	4340000	Maybe not anymore. But anyway, we're going to visit the classic game of the week.
4340000	4351000	Or as we are doing in the year 2020, once a month Dark Soccer is going to pick a pinball table that she thinks, hey, you guys should be knocking balls around to this.
4351000	4352000	Yep.
4352000	4353000	So Dark Soccer, what is the classic-
4353000	4355000	Rub these shiny metal balls.
4355000	4363000	But I do like, and before I hit the B roll on this, I do like that you picked something where this is the game being played in like pinball arcade, I think.
4363000	4365000	I did because the sound was cleaner.
4365000	4377000	Yeah, it is. And it kind of does go to show there's a, even if nothing matches the experience of playing real pinball, in a pinch, it'll get the fix in a little bit, something like this.
4378000	4385000	So the game that I picked sticking with the John Papa Duke theme from last month is Theater of Magic.
4385000	4390000	And before I go into Theater of Magic, I have a very special thing about this game.
4390000	4398000	I bought one from a coworker in the Bay Area in pristine condition that had some mods.
4398000	4401000	I'll be talking a little bit about some of the mods for it.
4401000	4405000	But Dan and I bought this on our 13th wedding anniversary.
4405000	4414000	And so he's added something into the little splash screen that has happy 13th anniversary for us.
4414000	4416000	So this particular one is very special to us.
4416000	4420000	And it's also our dear friend Melody's favorite pinball.
4420000	4423000	And if we hadn't bought it, I think she would have bought it.
4423000	4427000	So I've been trying to find her one too.
4427000	4435000	At any rate, Theater of Magic was designed by John Papa Duke, produced by Midway under the Bally name.
4435000	4440000	And it's released on March 28th, 1995.
4440000	4449000	And with artwork done by Linda Deal, programming by Jeff Johnson, music and sound effects done by Dave Zabriskie.
4449000	4454000	There were 6,600 units in its production run.
4454000	4457000	The game has a series of four objectives.
4457000	4461000	Each one has to be completed to qualify for the wizard mode grand finale.
4461000	4465000	So you have theater, where you spell theater by shooting the left loop, one letter per shot.
4465000	4468000	And it begins a hurry up countdown.
4468000	4472000	Multiball, so you shoot the ramp to spell magic, one letter per shot.
4472000	4474000	Then lock two balls by shooting the inner loop.
4474000	4477000	And then hit the magic trunk to begin theater multiball.
4477000	4480000	My magic trunk is also kind of modded.
4480000	4484000	You can get aftermarket ones that are this harder rubber that doesn't crack.
4484000	4486000	Mine actually has like a chain around it.
4486000	4489000	I kind of dig the little just, you know, aesthetic mod.
4489000	4492000	Anyway, next one you have Midnight Madness.
4492000	4496000	So you repeat shots to the right loop to advance the clock one hour at a time starting from noon.
4496000	4499000	Once it reaches midnight, midnight madness round begins.
4499000	4505000	The clock running backwards in the shots to the magic trunk awarding points based on the hour that it shows.
4505000	4512000	The clock can be advanced with a skill shot or as a reward for sending the ball into the basement when the right ramp is raised.
4512000	4514000	Then you have illusions.
4514000	4516000	Number one is tiger saw.
4516000	4521000	My tiger saw is modified again to where it spins the saw on it.
4521000	4522000	So it's pretty cool.
4522000	4524000	You have levitating woman.
4524000	4528000	You have the trunk escape, spirit card, safe escape, metamorphosis, straight jacket, and hat trick.
4528000	4530000	I'm not going to go into how to do all of those.
4530000	4531000	Y'all can play the game.
4532000	4541000	And then the grand finale will require you to make 12 ramp or loop shots within 60 seconds in order to spell magic theater and collect 500 million points.
4541000	4543000	A little bit more technicality about the game.
4543000	4545000	It uses the DCS sound system.
4548000	4551000	It also, to get a little bit more into it.
4553000	4555000	Hold on just take me a moment.
4555000	4565000	It looks like that Bally also released 29 different machines in general.
4565000	4567000	Starting in 1860.
4567000	4569000	So theater magic has been used for a while.
4569000	4581000	Some of the other contemporaries of this one would be Black Rose.
4581000	4583000	Which I also own Black Rose.
4583000	4586000	Party Zone Corvette Doctor Who.
4586000	4593000	So this is another upright standard table.
4593000	4600000	And it's really considered I would say one of the best.
4600000	4605000	I mean this is like when a lot of people are asked what's your favorite pinball.
4605000	4608000	Freaking theater of magic is right up on the top of their list.
4608000	4611000	So a little bit more than going into the video game forum.
4611000	4615000	As we are seeing we are looking at a version.
4615000	4619000	I believe this is the pinball arcade version of the pinball effects one.
4622000	4623000	It is pinball arcade.
4623000	4624000	Okay.
4624000	4631000	So yes so it was on pinball arcade as a license table until June 30th 2018 due to the WMS license expiration.
4631000	4635000	It is available now in pinball FX3.
4635000	4641000	So and then there are unlicensed versions that were available for visual pinball and windows.
4641000	4651000	But at any rate this is again one of the I would just say top tier pinballs that you could get your hands on.
4651000	4653000	And now one of my top five for sure.
4653000	4658000	This one will on average set you back about six grand or more depending.
4658000	4663000	We thankfully got mine for like 45 or 46 something like that.
4663000	4670000	And then I pay like another 300 for like an entire ramp replacement set and two extra trunks.
4670000	4673000	Both again are aftermarket.
4673000	4678000	But they were I think one of them is from Germany that had like a hard rubber shell on it.
4678000	4680000	Really nice.
4680000	4686000	You can still find other manufacturers now who are reproducing the ramp sets.
4686000	4694000	Also, this one will work with the color D and D, which actually looks really, really good with it.
4694000	4697000	The effects in this game, the music, the voices.
4697000	4700000	It really is an immersive experience when it comes to pinball.
4700000	4702000	So there you go.
4702000	4707000	And another endorsement in our chat from YY are saying, can I just say this table is sublime.
4707000	4710000	I've had the pleasure of playing it on real table several times.
4710000	4711000	It's fast paced.
4711000	4712000	The goals are super fun.
4712000	4714000	The rotating trunk is super cool.
4714000	4715000	The ramps are fun to shoot.
4715000	4716000	The sports get super high.
4716000	4718000	Basically, everything about it is great.
4718000	4719000	Highly recommended.
4719000	4721000	I will tell you one thing about this, though, is a point.
4721000	4731000	And mostly because of the things that YY said, it actually is not usually used as a tournament table because of the point systems.
4731000	4734000	And the rule sets are not very friendly for tournament play.
4734000	4743000	So that's why when we host league, I mean, theater, honestly, enough kind of gets ignored except by the people who play.
4743000	4746000	Classic pinball table of the month.
4746000	4747000	Great pick here.
4747000	4749000	Theater of magic.
4749000	4754000	And don't worry, you might hear a Doctor Who come up in future months.
4754000	4755000	We've got 12 months in the year.
4755000	4758000	We've got 12 months and I have 13 pinballs in my house.
4758000	4760000	So I'm not doing all the ones that I own.
4760000	4765000	Oh, and I remember now I was going to mention the pinball tables they had at the actual 80s place that I went.
4765000	4768000	So they have the Munsters table, which I saw it looks like that's pretty new.
4768000	4769000	Oh, the new one, yeah.
4769000	4771000	Is it the black and white one or the color one?
4771000	4775000	I, you mean like the screen on it?
4775000	4776000	No, the whole thing.
4776000	4778000	They have a black and white limited edition.
4778000	4779000	No, it's in color.
4779000	4781000	Does it have the interplay field?
4781000	4783000	I don't know.
4783000	4786000	There's a color one at the coin op downtown.
4786000	4793000	I played the, when I first played Munsters, I played the special edition that's got like a mini little pinball inside of it set into the thing.
4793000	4796000	And you play with like teeny tiny like ball bearing size pinballs.
4796000	4797000	It's adorable.
4797000	4798000	That's cute.
4798000	4799000	What else do they have?
4799000	4804000	The other one was, um, it's a driving one and I can't remember.
4804000	4805000	High speed?
4805000	4806000	Yeah.
4806000	4807000	The chase?
4807000	4808000	It might have been the chase.
4808000	4809000	Yeah.
4809000	4810000	Okay.
4810000	4811000	Cause, um, no, there was, yeah, the getaway.
4811000	4812000	And then there was high speed.
4812000	4813000	The getaway.
4813000	4814000	The getaway.
4814000	4815000	I'm sorry.
4815000	4816000	It's the getaway.
4816000	4817000	We used to own the getaway.
4817000	4818000	It's pretty fun.
4818000	4819000	You have like a gear shift on it.
4819000	4820000	It's pretty neat.
4820000	4821000	High gear.
4821000	4822000	High gear was one of those games.
4822000	4823000	It was the other NES pinball game.
4823000	4824000	Yeah.
4824000	4825000	That wasn't pinball, right?
4825000	4826000	So they've got.
4826000	4827000	High speed.
4827000	4828000	It was a high speed.
4828000	4829000	High speed.
4829000	4830000	Yeah.
4830000	4832240	They've got a centipede machine that's broken right now, but they have the trackball replaced
4832240	4834000	with an eight ball, which is kind of cool.
4834000	4841680	Um, they've got a Batman driving game, a play choice 10 and donkey Kong three.
4841680	4845480	Oh, the, the forgotten donkey Kong, no one ever talks about three.
4845480	4851000	The one where you're killing bugs, uh, the one that's a shooter as opposed to a platformer.
4851000	4853480	That's why donkey Kong's ass.
4853480	4854480	Yeah.
4854480	4855600	You're literally blowing smoke up his ass.
4855600	4856600	I know.
4856600	4860160	Uh, hype mayhem in our chat says, I wish I could get a pinball table, but I can't afford
4860160	4861160	thousands of dollars.
4861160	4865400	Plus I don't trust me, my cats not to damage it.
4865400	4870160	Midna has been great around our tables, just saying, um, and you don't have to have thousands
4870160	4872400	of dollars to get into pinball.
4872400	4879120	There are plenty of times like we got a black rose for free on the side of the road and
4879120	4883600	Dan's been fixing it up for his friend, Brian, um, they've been working on it together.
4883600	4886640	Um, Craigslist, people will get rid of them.
4886640	4891240	Our very first one that we got, I think was, was it Rocky and Bull ankle?
4891240	4895360	And we got that Dan did some work for somebody and got paid in a pinball table and it might,
4895360	4897840	it might not be a desirable thing.
4897840	4900960	It's probably broken all hell if somebody is willing to get rid of it for free, but
4900960	4901960	it's, it's a fixer upper.
4901960	4902960	Right?
4902960	4907060	Well, the thing about that too, is that a lot of the ones that you'll find, um, it's
4907060	4908060	easy to get.
4908060	4912360	I mean, some of them are not so easy to get parts for, but you've got to be willing to
4912360	4917560	learn how to do the work for it because it is so much cheaper to shop your machine yourself.
4917560	4922560	And YouTube obviously has exactly, I mean, and once you know what the parts are and go
4922560	4927920	through it and on top of that, um, most, uh, the pinball internet database has most of
4927920	4933020	the manuals for these tables online, including their repair options, parts, orders, things
4933020	4934020	like that.
4934020	4938040	And I'll tell you, like, even though like I'm looking there right now, but like, um,
4938040	4945440	I find Facebook marketplace, it's basically like Craigslist, um, but that's where I got
4945440	4946440	my DDR machine.
4946440	4948880	I got a killer deal on the DVR machine.
4948880	4952280	I wish I could get that virtual on, but we have zero space for it.
4952280	4953640	I posted a picture.
4953640	4957400	There's a virtual on, um, cabinet that they're selling 800 bucks.
4957400	4958400	Yeah.
4958400	4959400	Oh wow.
4959400	4961040	But you've seen my garage.
4961040	4962640	It's filled with Mustang and pinball.
4962640	4965760	You have so many pinball machines, you have no place left to put a machine like that.
4965760	4966760	Pretty much.
4966760	4967760	Yeah.
4967760	4972400	Um, I mean, now if I found a planet Harrier, Oh my God, you'd make the room.
4972400	4977080	No, we, we actually had an offer on one and we didn't have any room for it.
4977080	4983200	Um, but someone's also, Dan was telling me that someone did like a home, like mini version,
4983200	4987320	uh, with the full play field and everything, but a mini version of a planet Harriers.
4987320	4992240	It was like a home mod or something that was like, Oh, I want, but at any rate, yeah, you
4992240	4994400	don't need a lot of money to get into pinball.
4994400	4998240	Just keep your eyes open, be vigilant and you'll find something.
4998240	5002960	Well, and I was going to say too, like, you know, luckily we have these digital recreations
5002960	5006840	as well and I know they're not the same thing, but you know, for somebody that kind of wants
5006840	5014120	the fix or once, Oh my God, I need, I need arcade one up to make me a mini driving cabinet.
5014120	5015120	That's what I need.
5015120	5018340	Well, aren't they doing like a version of the star Wars cabinet?
5018340	5019800	That's a sit down cabinet.
5019800	5020800	Yeah, exactly.
5020800	5025960	But I need, I need a sit down cabinet with like San Francisco rush and like Dan already
5025960	5032160	sold his rig in my, I know, but like I'm talking about like something like arcade one up.
5032160	5033160	That's things.
5033160	5034160	Those things have been doing really well.
5034160	5035160	It might happen.
5035160	5036160	Stay tuned.
5036160	5037160	I need that in my life.
5037160	5038160	All right.
5038160	5039160	Anyway.
5039160	5040440	Uh, and dark tissue is saying arcade one up is doing a line of pins.
5040440	5042840	So we're going to have many pinball machines before too long.
5042840	5043840	That'll be interesting.
5043840	5046640	So, all right, maybe theater magic will be one of them.
5046640	5047640	Who knows?
5047640	5048640	All right.
5048640	5049640	Got the real thing.
5050480	5051480	All right.
5051480	5052480	For now.
5052480	5053480	Uh, we're going to move on with the show.
5053480	5056800	Uh, at this point though, this is, this is where I had planned for you to make your exit,
5056800	5058200	although you can certainly stay up to your limit.
5058200	5059200	Dark Sakura.
5059200	5060760	I don't know what your plan is.
5060760	5066040	Um, I'll probably probably go on cause the sooner I get to bed, the less sleep deprived
5066040	5067040	I'll be in the morning.
5067040	5070840	Um, so, and just, I don't know if we were really explicit about this last week, but
5070840	5073720	you kind of have a, and for those that have been listening for a couple of years, you
5073720	5078360	had kind of a real bad conflict to work situation where you weren't even here for a few months.
5078360	5082880	And this is unfortunately, I was actually working on Sunday, but this is unfortunately
5082880	5086080	kind of a similar situation where you're, now you're working at like four or five in
5086080	5087080	the morning.
5087080	5088080	Right.
5088080	5089080	Tomorrow.
5089080	5094680	Um, my normal schedule has me working at 5am and for me to be able to get up and be awake
5094680	5099680	and do my 15 minutes of skincare, um, well, I ain't getting younger.
5099680	5107200	Um, I have to be up at three 30 in the morning and like last night I actually, I worked yesterday
5107200	5111360	and then went out doing sister stuff and I didn't get to bed until two 30.
5111360	5114000	I was up for 23 hours.
5114000	5116000	So yeah.
5116000	5117360	Wow.
5117360	5119640	So this is my life.
5119640	5122040	I know you're trying to do some wheeling and dealing.
5122040	5125420	So hopefully this doesn't go on too long, but you may be having some short episodes
5125420	5126420	for a little while.
5126420	5127920	Just while you get that worked out.
5127920	5131080	And I mean, I actually tried to get two hours off in the morning so I could do the whole
5131080	5135200	show, but, um, I could only get one hour off in the morning.
5135200	5136200	So say lovey.
5136200	5140280	Well, we'll take all the Jamie we can get, but in the meantime, no, you can't have all
5140280	5141280	of it.
5141280	5143160	In the meantime, make that coin.
5143160	5144160	You gotta, gotta be dead.
5144160	5146600	You gotta buy more pinball machines.
5146600	5151620	I gotta get bigger house to have more pinball that too, or just, you know, fill in the whole
5151620	5153400	backyard and make it nothing but pinball.
5153400	5155320	Uh, final thoughts for our listeners tonight.
5155320	5156320	Um, I'm sleepy.
5156320	5157320	All right.
5157320	5158320	I hate the schedule.
5158320	5159320	Good night.
5159320	5160320	Sleep tight.
5160320	5161320	It makes me want to set people on fire.
5161320	5163960	Oh, please don't set me or this house on fire.
5163960	5164960	No.
5165120	5166800	I mean, y'all are great.
5166800	5168680	I'm talking about people.
5168680	5172640	I understand the man.
5172640	5177240	There's certain people I would like to see burn, but I shouldn't, I shan't to say so.
5177240	5178240	All right.
5178240	5179240	We'll have a great rest of your night.
5179240	5180240	Our soccer.
5180240	5181240	Thanks for being here.
5181240	5182240	You too.
5182240	5183240	All right.
5183240	5184240	I'll take my spam and go.
5184240	5185240	Okay.
5185240	5186560	I literally did have spam for dinner.
5186560	5190000	Let's move on to some rapid fire news and we'll talk about some other big headlines
5190000	5191000	of the week.
5191000	5192000	A little quicker.
5192040	5198880	So Red Dead Redemption 2 has almost doubled the sales of the previous Red Dead Redemption.
5198880	5206080	Um, number two sitting at right now, 29 million lifetime sales, whereas the original made
5206080	5208480	15 million lifetime sales.
5208480	5215360	So I mean, obviously it's going to happen sooner or later, but it's, uh, not a bad number
5215360	5216600	there.
5216600	5223480	And I'm assuming though, they're seeing that even though that it's doing quite well, that
5223480	5228560	their quarterly revenue is down 25% year over year.
5228560	5232840	And that, uh, take two stock has dropped, you know, 9.6%.
5232840	5236400	That is, you know, with Red Dead Redemption 2, that's a game that like, I thought I would
5236400	5241480	really like, and then I didn't like it too much.
5241480	5242480	Yeah.
5242480	5243480	It was like that too.
5243480	5244480	What happened?
5244480	5246280	It's too sim is what it is.
5246480	5248040	Grand Theft Auto is fine.
5248040	5252840	Like I like Grand Theft Auto because you kind of run around and like do stuff, but even
5252840	5259840	like online is to like management stuff and everything like costs money and it's not really
5259840	5260840	fun.
5260840	5263000	Like I liked four where it's just like, Hey, it's a death match.
5263000	5266280	Hey, you go in there, you kill people and you come back out and you're done.
5266280	5271520	Uh, whereas this is like this persistent online thing and I, I just not interested in that.
5271760	5276320	Um, and then Red Dead Online, you're definitely not really interested in that at all.
5276320	5282840	Um, I think maybe like on PC, I might enjoy it more with mods, you know, being able to
5282840	5288280	cut some of that SIM stuff out and just being able to enjoy like the storyline or something.
5288280	5294720	That might be a little bit more my cup of tea, but just the game by itself.
5294720	5295720	Nah.
5296680	5302480	Um, and then there's going to be some more games coming to Xbox game pass.
5302480	5310280	Um, of that we've got Final Fantasy 15 and Wolfenstein Youngblood are, um, should be
5310280	5313200	already on Xbox games pass now.
5313200	5319960	Um, and then of course there's also going to be Xbox one and PC versions of, um, death
5320000	5327920	squared and deaths gambit coming, um, pretty soon, but 15, that's not bad.
5327920	5329480	Check it out.
5329480	5332480	I need the finish checking it out because I've only checked out about 10 minutes.
5332480	5334400	I bought it like on a deep sale on steam.
5334400	5337280	So the game pass thing doesn't really do anything for me, but I think it's neat.
5337280	5340700	And maybe when, when they eventually tied into X clouds, so I can play it on some beefy
5340700	5343560	machines and stuff and stream it, that might be very interesting.
5343560	5347160	Um, of course I am assuming that it's going to be a thing in the future, but it just,
5347160	5350120	it does seem like a logical conclusion to come to.
5350120	5351120	We'll see, we'll see.
5351120	5355000	2020 could be an interesting year, uh, some interesting personnel changes going on in
5355000	5356000	the gaming industry.
5356000	5360240	Uh, so we have a rod of Ferguson, who's the head of coalition studio.
5360240	5363180	They are behind the gears of war games right now, and he's been working on this series
5363180	5366080	for 15 years and he's announced he's leaving.
5366080	5370320	Uh, and where's he going well in March, he will be over Diablo.
5370320	5371320	That's right.
5371320	5374000	He's going to blizzard to oversee the Diablo franchise.
5374000	5378400	This will include development on Diablo four, and, uh, I guess somewhat what left what's
5378400	5380820	left to be done on that Diablo immortal game.
5380820	5384380	Needless to say, blizzard could use a little help with messaging, I suppose after what
5384380	5386120	happened a couple of Blizzcons ago.
5386120	5387960	So maybe there'll be some help to be had here.
5387960	5392280	I'm not sure what gears of war has in common with Diablo, but I don't think the games necessarily
5392280	5393960	need to be of the same type.
5393960	5396880	I think a studio head does a lot of the business ends of things.
5396880	5398400	So it'll be interesting to see what develops.
5398400	5399400	I know it.
5399400	5402960	And also is the person that's often to blame when some of these things go wrong that we
5402960	5406760	don't like, such as a game taking eight years to get a localized official version in the
5406760	5407760	U S right.
5407760	5408760	Yeah.
5408760	5411680	So it'll be interesting to see what happens with that.
5411680	5416480	Uh, also, uh, Fortnite, I know some of you are still playing Fortnite and it is interesting
5416480	5420120	to see some of the various crossovers that Fortnite has done over the years.
5420120	5425000	And, uh, somebody that digs into those types of files with Fortnite and things has discovered
5425000	5430460	that a Harley Quinn will soon be available within Fortnite, apparently Batman and Catwoman
5430460	5431460	are already there.
5431460	5434780	They don't play in a Fortnite to really be able to tell you, uh, but it would make sense
5434780	5438300	as the birds of prey movie is the thing that just happened this weekend and I'm assuming
5438300	5439300	it did well.
5439300	5441180	I heard some people told me it was good.
5441180	5442580	I don't really watch enough movies.
5442580	5444900	It hasn't really been on my list of things to see.
5444900	5449260	Um, but, uh, it's no surprise really that Harley Quinn is making its way or making her
5449260	5450260	way to Fortnite.
5450260	5451740	And you know, Sonic comes out this week.
5451740	5452740	Oh, that's right.
5452740	5454360	It's Valentine's day weekend, right?
5454360	5456580	You know, it's, I do want to see it, believe it or not.
5456580	5459420	I am going to go probably Saturday.
5459420	5463860	I would see it opening day, but, um, I don't think that's going to work, but I'll take
5463860	5465100	my kids to go see it.
5465100	5471200	So what's, what's interesting is that I haven't had hosting gigs since last year, just because
5471200	5475260	the holidays are kind of a slower period and January doesn't exactly start to ramp up.
5475260	5480140	So I have back to, I have a hosting gig Friday and I have a hosting gig Saturday.
5480140	5484100	So for those of you in the Sacramento area, uh, I, both these shows are the colonial theater,
5484100	5487740	a Rocky or a picture show on Saturday and a burlesque variety show on Friday.
5487740	5491700	Um, so I won't be able to see Sonic this weekend cause I'll be too busy hosting.
5491700	5492700	Let's go Sunday.
5492700	5495460	Uh, if it's before OLR during the day, maybe.
5495460	5496460	Yeah.
5496460	5497460	I'd be open to that.
5497460	5501140	I'll just have to, I'll just have to talk to, uh, Hubbers and make sure, well, you can
5501140	5502140	talk to Hubbers.
5502140	5503140	He's on his way in.
5503140	5504140	All right.
5504140	5508540	So maybe I will see it before the show, who knows, but you are such a Jim Carrey fan.
5508540	5509540	You've been excited.
5509540	5510540	It looks good.
5510540	5511540	I'm excited.
5511540	5514780	And even like the little clips that they show are pretty funny.
5514780	5519820	Speaking of clips, did you know that within PSO two, there are these big video screens
5519820	5523660	and actually right during the beta, what's playing on those video screens is the Sonic
5523660	5525340	trailer for the movie.
5525340	5528260	So, and it plays, it plays like it's a YouTube or something that you actually see in full
5528260	5529860	resolution and everything up on these screens.
5529860	5530860	It's kind of neat.
5530860	5534420	They were doing like concerts and stuff too, but I was, I was out playing board games last
5534420	5538060	night, so I missed all the concert stuff, but yeah, they run the Sonic trailer over
5538060	5539060	and over, which is interesting.
5539060	5540060	Interesting.
5540580	5542380	That was an interesting way to, uh, but it looks funny.
5542380	5543820	So I'll watch it.
5543820	5544820	Yeah.
5544820	5545820	All right.
5545820	5547420	I'm moving on.
5547420	5548500	That's it for rapid fire news.
5548500	5552500	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games coming soon
5552500	5554780	to a store near you.
5554780	5555780	All right.
5555780	5560980	Um, we don't have a whole lot coming out this week, but we've got AO tennis two on PC and
5560980	5568020	it's in the switch, uh, PlayStation four and Xbox one monster Hunter world ice born on PC.
5568020	5575260	Uh, we have outlier dust trilogy deluxe pack on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation four
5575260	5579140	and even have stuff coming out on the, Oh, I'm sorry.
5579140	5580780	I am looking at January.
5580780	5583620	That's why some of these sound very familiar.
5583620	5586020	I was like, wait a minute, scratch all of those games.
5586020	5587460	Those are already out.
5587460	5588460	Surprise.
5588460	5592840	Um, so now let's talk about the actual games that are coming out this week to pull chat.
5592840	5594660	How many of you actually had a reaction though?
5594660	5595740	That's like, Oh, that's new.
5595740	5596740	I have to check that out.
5596780	5598300	How many of you actually had that reaction?
5598300	5600100	Like didn't even realize those games are out.
5600100	5601100	All right.
5601100	5602980	So, um, this is a little bit more interesting.
5602980	5608420	So we've got a zero lane cross wave on PC and PlayStation four this week.
5608420	5611260	We see a Damon X Machina on PC.
5611260	5618540	Uh, we have Darksiders Genesis on Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
5618540	5624700	I didn't realize that this is a this week, but dreams is coming out on PlayStation four.
5624700	5631920	We have snack world, the dungeon crawl gold on Nintendo switch street fighter five championship
5631920	5635740	edition on PC and PlayStation four.
5635740	5640780	And last but not least a warriors Orochi for ultimate on Nintendo switch and PlayStation
5640780	5641780	four.
5641780	5642780	That's it.
5642780	5643940	All right.
5643940	5644940	Heading over to Japan.
5644940	5649180	Um, the releases look a little light in Japan this week, but uh, Nintendo switch has a pretty
5649180	5652860	big one in Hatsune Miku project diva, mega 39.
5652860	5654380	It's a 10th anniversary collection.
5654380	5656260	I think it's like the first time this is on the switch.
5656260	5659660	I think that's kind of why this is notable, but Hatsune Miku fans, I'm sure we'll be very
5659660	5663180	happy to check that out on the switch this week.
5663180	5665500	I'm heading over to the PlayStation four.
5665500	5671940	We have death end request two that is out in Japan this week, as well as dead by daylight.
5671940	5678120	The story of Yamaoka family that is also out in Japan as well as dreams universe.
5678120	5681260	I don't know if that's the same thing as just dreams.
5681260	5682260	I think it is.
5682260	5683260	Yeah.
5683260	5685460	It's coming out, uh, in Japan this week.
5685460	5686460	That's pretty cool.
5686460	5687460	Check that out.
5687460	5688460	Yeah, for sure.
5688460	5689460	Um, interesting.
5689460	5690740	It has a different title over there though.
5690740	5691740	So there you go.
5691740	5692740	Those are the Japanese releases.
5692740	5693740	How about the UK?
5693740	5694740	Loki.
5694740	5695740	All right.
5695740	5699420	So we've got, um, funny enough, they're just now getting the back button attachment for
5699420	5700540	the dual shock four.
5700540	5704700	So that's coming out in PlayStation this week, street fighter five championship edition on
5704700	5711060	PlayStation four, um, black future 88, the physical edition coming out on Nintendo switch
5711060	5712720	and that's a local game dev here.
5712720	5713720	So that's pretty awesome.
5713720	5720840	Uh, we have snack world on Nintendo switch worries, Rochi for ultimate on PlayStation
5720840	5728720	four, Xbox one and switch Darksiders Genesis on PlayStation four, Xbox one and switch.
5728720	5732080	And finally dreams on PlayStation four.
5732080	5733080	All right.
5733080	5737800	Uh, this is the part of the show where typically we would go to the mailbag over at participate
5737800	5743200	at orange lounge, radio.com, but sadly we do not have any emails this week and I don't
5743200	5745920	even have a dark soccer here to dish about drag race with.
5745920	5749880	Um, but I am trying to change things up here a little bit with this segment for when we
5749880	5754320	don't necessarily get any emails and try to go back to Twitter a little bit and invite
5754320	5757560	your guys's tweets over at O L R on Twitter.
5757560	5762000	Uh, in fact, I even tried to ask a prompting question tonight about the PSO two beta, but
5762000	5765160	I probably posted it too late or people are still playing the beta.
5765160	5767200	So I didn't get a lot of feedback on that unfortunately.
5767200	5771600	So I'll just have to kind of try to make an effort to spice in more Twitter headlines
5771600	5773600	throughout the week and get your feedback on that.
5773600	5778320	Um, but I do want to make sure you guys are aware we are, we are trying to get back on
5778320	5782640	Twitter using, uh, the interactivity there just because I realized some of you don't
5782640	5786240	want to write the long form emails sometimes, but if you do, we still invite those participate
5786240	5788180	at orange laundry, dio.com.
5788180	5791040	But for those of you with shorter thoughts or you just have a quick question, you just
5791040	5793720	want to ask like, you know, what do you think about this release or what do you think about
5793720	5796640	this game or have you checked out this retro title or whatever it is?
5796640	5801760	Uh, you can send that over to our Twitter at O L R. So I will instead make that announcement
5801760	5802760	with this segment.
5802760	5806520	And then there's also that show that came on this week that I checked out.
5806520	5808160	It was pretty awesome.
5808160	5812560	Brick masters or Lego masters, Lego masters thing.
5812560	5813560	Yeah.
5813560	5817040	They, they have a European show with is the U S one is cool.
5817040	5818400	What's what, what did they do?
5818400	5821940	It's like, I think of it like one of those like cake or cooking competition shows.
5821940	5824400	So they have, it's my favorite sort of.
5824400	5825400	Yeah.
5825440	5829240	A bunch of teams of two that are like chopped.
5829240	5832400	That's what's always on the fucking food network in the lunchroom.
5832400	5838600	I watch chopped all the time, but yes, so, um, sort of like those where they're given
5838600	5843320	a theme and then they have to build something and then the top person, you know, top group
5843320	5848620	gets like some immunity idle thing and then, you know, the bottom two, one of them gets
5848620	5849620	sent home.
5849620	5851080	Has to lip sync for their life.
5851080	5855360	Uh, not exactly, but, but yeah, it's so, it's, so it's,
5855360	5858520	so it's all that and, um, it's fun.
5858520	5859860	I liked it.
5859860	5863760	I will say the one tangential drag race thing I could bring up is that RuPaul apparently
5863760	5865960	hosted Saturday night live last night.
5865960	5869220	I missed it cause board games, you know, I was out doing that and well, that's what YouTube's
5869220	5870220	for now.
5870220	5871220	Yeah.
5871220	5872220	Right.
5872220	5873220	All the clips.
5873220	5874220	Yeah.
5874220	5875220	They do put all the clips up there, but I'm curious how that went, how that was, if it
5875220	5876220	was funny or not.
5876220	5878380	Apparently it got good ratings though.
5878380	5882240	They said that that episode brought in better ratings than the week before and it was one
5882240	5888240	of the stronger, I think it tied with the will also the musical guest or no, no, they
5888240	5889240	had Justin Bieber.
5889240	5893220	Uh, so they think it's some kind of kind of combination of a Bieber nation or whatever
5893220	5897500	they call the fans and RuPaul, uh, and you know, people hoping to see him in drag and
5897500	5899720	stuff, uh, kind of carried that a little bit.
5899720	5905840	So, but I don't believe RuPaul showed up in drag except in taped segments, which was,
5905840	5910480	you know, it, from what I understand, it takes a team of people to put RuPaul together at
5910480	5911640	this point.
5911640	5915440	So it probably is a complex mechanism of wheels and pulleys.
5915440	5919760	You're saying, you're saying that RuPaul hasn't quite gathered the technology that like Tony
5919760	5926400	Stark has, where he's just like, it's a technology, but it's just, you know, it's a little different.
5926400	5929800	So nano machines to put together the drag outfit.
5929800	5930800	Yeah.
5930800	5931800	All right.
5931800	5932800	Anyway, let's move on.
5932800	5937400	Uh, let's get back into gaming and talk about, um, emulation, uh, uh, kind of an interesting
5937400	5938400	topic sometimes.
5938400	5939400	Yeah.
5939400	5945960	Um, considering, um, you know, obviously I it's very early, but PlayStation 4, um, emulation
5945960	5950080	is kind of being, it's a thing that's starting to happen now.
5950080	5958400	So, um, right now there's a project called GP CS4 that has managed to boot a commercial
5958400	5959400	game.
5959400	5968200	It's, um, not necessarily playable, I mean, it's quite slow, but it is progress.
5968200	5973520	Um, but, but it's there, it's not just a loading error failure or anything like that.
5973520	5974520	Right.
5974520	5976680	It is actually, it is, it is a program that is running.
5976680	5977680	It is.
5977680	5978680	Yes.
5978680	5979680	It is a thing.
5979680	5980680	Yeah.
5980680	5985520	So right now they're, um, trying to move on to near automata, which is, it seems like
5985520	5991120	a loft that is like immensely more complicated than the game that they're booting right now,
5991120	5996440	but, um, it is something that is being worked on, but interesting.
5996680	6001640	Um, there's also another emulation project called orbital that I don't know what the
6001640	6007320	progress is on that one, but very interesting to see that we've come a long way for this.
6007320	6010360	I don't know how feasible this is going to be.
6010360	6015680	I probably not anytime soon, but you know, computers are getting more powerful, so why
6015680	6016680	not?
6016680	6019640	It's just a matter of the technology getting more powerful and you know, pretty soon I'm
6019640	6022160	sure they'll start to run it a little more full speed.
6022160	6025520	And I know people might be uncomfortable when we talk about emulation because I know a lot
6025520	6029760	of times emulation gets tied to piracy and so forth, you know, like some people might
6029760	6033240	be looking at this as like, Oh, this is just a way to, you know, play PlayStation four games
6033240	6034240	for free.
6034240	6038920	But I kind of don't know if that is such a, I don't think that's really the only way to
6038920	6042480	look at these things anymore or even our way you should look at these things anymore because
6042480	6046120	I think it's a little more complicated than that because, um, well for one, the technology's
6046120	6049920	not going to be there until long after they stop, you know, selling PlayStation four games
6049920	6051920	new in GameStop, or at least it feels that way.
6051920	6052920	Right?
6052920	6054600	Like we're not going to get 60 frames a second, 10 80 piece.
6054680	6059360	We might get playable, uh, very soon, but we're not going to get like full, you know,
6059360	6062320	speed full everything in the next couple of years.
6062320	6066600	But I think what's also really important to what's interesting here in the year 2020 just
6066600	6071680	last week, we were talking about how there is a, um, big website preserving all these
6071680	6074960	flash games because flash is going away.
6074960	6075960	Right.
6075960	6081020	And I think when it comes to video game preservation, I think there's very strongly a pro case to
6081020	6085620	be made for PlayStation four emulation and how we kind of need something like that to
6085620	6092940	ensure that these games are still explorable on newer technologies as PCs get better and
6092940	6093940	better.
6093940	6097180	And also like at some point, like I get it, you guys kind of kind of cut your losses.
6097180	6102180	I mean, cause if you think about it, it's like, how much are we really impacting the
6102180	6109140	sales of games when we're like, say emulating the Xbox three 60 at this point or like emulating
6109140	6113980	the original, like PlayStation two or something like you're really not like cutting into those
6113980	6115300	sales.
6115300	6120020	I think at all on anything, it's just kind of a fun thing to do.
6120020	6124500	It's not like I'm, I'm doing this because I don't want to pay for your game.
6124500	6128300	You know, like I don't think it's, I don't, I don't really think it's that.
6128300	6131620	I think it's part of the preservation thing I think is really exciting, especially as
6131620	6135820	you know, uh, it's going to be harder and harder to maybe find these games or, um, you
6135820	6140740	know, as, as servers get shut down, I would imagine, and maybe I'm just being ignorant
6140740	6145900	and I fully admit that this would lead to potentially being able to emulate and be able
6145900	6149900	to have it connect to a different type of server so that people could continue to play
6149900	6153500	online games even after the plug has maybe been pulled.
6153500	6156740	You know, and maybe I realize it gets a little weird cause you know, you're emulating, so
6156740	6160240	you're running the original codes, but yeah, but I feel like this still kind of cracks
6160240	6165340	the door open to that sort of, you know, ability to preserve some of these online only games
6165340	6169900	that have gone and now, you know, our kids and our kids' kids won't be able to really
6169900	6172780	check them out, you know, unless we have something like this.
6172780	6175300	And then of course there's the whole home brew element too.
6175300	6176300	Yes.
6176300	6180740	I'm hoping someday in the far future, you know, we'll have, you know, games, are you
6180740	6186980	full, you know, full speed emulation for Xbox 360 with online support so that I can bring
6186980	6189260	back my modded Grand Theft Auto games.
6189260	6194460	Ah, someday, someday it'll happen where I can play multiplayer with that nose.
6194460	6195460	And let's be real too.
6195460	6198140	We need to make sure that your kids someday can play PT.
6198140	6200340	It's very important, right?
6200340	6201740	Not really.
6201740	6202740	What?
6202740	6206140	I would think, I would think PT would be the game on top of that list.
6206140	6207140	Not near.
6207140	6208140	Okay.
6208140	6210340	Maybe I could see near, but PT should be towards the top of that list of things we've got to
6210340	6212040	get emulated fast.
6212040	6213040	So I don't know.
6213040	6215900	Anyway, I talk like it's an easy thing to do.
6215900	6216940	It's very much not.
6216940	6222880	So good luck to everybody that's working volunteer hours cause you know, it ain't like Sony,
6222880	6226120	you know, putting their own people on it, uh, to put something like that together.
6226120	6230500	How long until someone, uh, recreates PT in Dreams?
6230500	6232760	If that's probably already been done or anything.
6232760	6234040	Didn't we have that headline for him?
6234040	6235040	Maybe we did.
6235040	6236280	I don't know.
6236280	6242440	It's been so long and I don't keep track of the Dreams stuff, but yeah, so, all right.
6242440	6248320	Uh, let's Questbuster in chat says someone did manage to save Yaris from Oblivion.
6248760	6253240	Well, let's, let's thank that individual for their cultural contributions, shan't we?
6253240	6255640	Has someone put a Yaris in Oblivion though?
6255640	6256640	That's the question.
6256640	6257640	All right.
6257640	6263560	Uh, let's move on and talk about, uh, this is actually a pretty serious and it's again,
6263560	6268480	one of those little stories about how like real world can kind of impact the gaming industry.
6268480	6272720	Not to say gaming industry isn't the real world, but it's, it's just kind of interesting.
6273400	6279880	And it has to do with, uh, folks that are not able to get into the US to be able to
6279880	6281800	work on video games.
6281800	6286360	Um, for example, and I apologize, I'm probably going to mispronounce these names, so I apologize,
6286360	6293240	but, um, Anam Sajid and Basima Zia, they are young female game developers from Pakistan
6293240	6297440	and they got scholarships from the IGDA Foundation, right?
6297440	6301360	The Independent Game Developers Association, or excuse me, International, sorry, not Independent,
6301360	6304720	uh, Game Developers Association, they got those scholarships early this year.
6304720	6308560	Uh, Sajid was going to be in the Scholars Program, Zia was going to be in the Velocity
6308560	6314480	Track, that's to try to propel people of marginalized genders with their game development careers.
6314480	6318960	So they got good news there and then they applied for visas to get to the United States
6318960	6321440	and they were rejected.
6321440	6327400	So unfortunately, because of that stuff that's going on in our world, uh, they were unable
6327400	6331880	to really, you know, make use of that, which is very sad.
6331880	6337160	Um, they've gone to Twitter to tweet some of their thoughts and, uh, Zia did, it's very
6337160	6342240	humble and very kind, uh, whereas I would probably be on Twitter going, fuck these fucking
6342240	6346880	people, fucking fucks, you know, uh, it's much more humble and graceful.
6346880	6349320	Uh, Zia says it's an honor nonetheless.
6349320	6354880	Uh, and what's interesting about that, the IGDA Pakistan account tweeted some pictures
6354880	6360560	of these females, uh, actually participating in the Global Game Jam 2020.
6360560	6365240	It's a worldwide marathon helping participants, uh, build games quickly and build a game in
6365240	6366760	just one weekend.
6366760	6368840	The theme was repair.
6368840	6374400	So the two of them worked together on a game called Trying to Fly.
6374400	6381160	And it's a 2D game based on the visa interview process that failed them.
6381160	6384920	Describing the game, they said they wanted to make a game that would highlight their
6384920	6390720	and others experience at the visa interview process and how such measures can directly
6390720	6394080	have an effect on their future careers and lives.
6394080	6401080	The bird represents the applicant's dreams and aspirations for the future.
6401080	6409800	If that doesn't dot the I and cross the T on the video games are art argument, I don't
6409800	6411440	know what does.
6411440	6418480	Because that's, that's amazing that, you know, because, because art is often born of these
6418480	6422840	types of strong feelings, expression, right?
6422840	6428320	And so these two women, even though they were probably very internally very upset at what
6428320	6431960	happened, they were externally very graceful in, uh, what they, you know, put out there
6431960	6437200	in their statements and so forth, but they still kind of took that energy and made a
6437200	6442960	game about it to describe what it feels like in a way.
6442960	6449120	So other people can experience that and feel even maybe a percentage of what they're feeling
6449120	6450120	in the moment.
6450120	6452160	Like that, that is art.
6452160	6453160	That is expressionism.
6453160	6459240	Like, I almost feel like a story like this makes the argument even better that video
6459240	6463800	games are art than like the video game journey does.
6463800	6467940	And you, you know what, you know, I'm being serious when I say that, cause y'all know
6467940	6471140	how much I love the video game journey and what a big fricking deal that is.
6471140	6475800	Even better than don't shit your pants, even, even way more important than don't shit your
6475800	6479000	pants when it comes to artistic contributions.
6479000	6480000	Absolutely.
6480000	6483960	Um, some folks in chat has actually, uh, some folks in chat have actually played the game,
6483960	6484960	which I think is great.
6484960	6487200	Uh, Questbuster says, I tried the game.
6487200	6490360	It's a tongue in cheek commentary on what they went through.
6490360	6493240	I'm a student visa denied.
6493280	6498360	So, uh, very, very, I, so I would definitely, I want to make it a point to play this game
6498360	6503320	myself this week and check it out and just, uh, you know, see, see what it's all about.
6503320	6507760	And I would encourage others to do the same, you know, unfortunately these, uh, women are
6507760	6511440	not able to come over here to the States to make some other games.
6511440	6514240	So they've made their own game to really describe what they're feeling.
6514240	6516900	And I think we owe it to them to check it out.
6516900	6519860	So, um, that's that on that.
6519860	6520860	Let's move on.
6520860	6521860	Loki.
6521860	6522860	All right.
6522860	6528180	Um, so, you know, kind of jumping back onto the EA hate train again.
6528180	6532500	Um, well, there's, there's nothing to make us feel better than a good old let's hate
6532500	6533500	EA story.
6533500	6537980	Uh, you know what, something the whole world can come together and agree on.
6537980	6538980	You know what?
6538980	6542580	We may have our differences when it comes to political opinions and we, we may have
6542580	6547260	our differences on these sorts of things, but darn, if we can all hold hands and agree
6547260	6549180	EA sucks.
6549180	6555820	So this is coming from a lawsuit filed from a couple lawyers in Paris that have basically
6555820	6561400	said on behalf of players who claim the only way to win at ultimate team is to spend real
6561400	6567340	money on packs, which, you know, it is a very play to win, uh, or pay to win game, uh, basically
6567340	6571280	said, you know, for example, um, in this game, everyone wants to have a dream team to go
6571280	6572640	as far as possible.
6572640	6578760	My client spends 600 Euro in five months without even getting a big player, the developers
6578760	6583080	of the game mode have created an illusionary and particularly addictive system.
6583080	6587920	The more you pay, the more you have the possibility of getting big players.
6587920	6593380	We believe that gambling, a gambling game has been integrated into this video game because
6593380	6596200	buying packs is nothing more than a bet.
6596200	6601780	It is a logic of a casino that has entered in their homes today and 11 or 12 year old
6601780	6608680	teenager can without restriction play, uh, FIFA ultimate team and commit money because
6608680	6614120	there's no parental control system in this mode, Belgium and the Netherlands have already
6614120	6617420	taken up this issue.
6617420	6622660	So they have filed a lawsuit and we'll see what happens here, but I mean, this isn't
6622660	6625720	the first time that someone's pointing out, I almost feel like this is a broken record
6625720	6626720	type of story.
6626720	6629980	What's fascinating to me is that here we are again, like it's almost like one of these
6629980	6633580	types of things that kind of like isn't going away, but it's also because obviously, you
6633580	6638500	know, sometimes we lose sight of it here in the States, but FIFA worldwide is the video
6638500	6639500	game.
6639500	6640500	Yeah.
6640500	6642200	And 600 600 is not even that much.
6642200	6646100	There is, um, comments that saying that, you know, some individuals, they knew people that
6646100	6651060	spent two or 3,000 Euro on this game as well.
6651060	6656700	And mind you that this is only good for like this one iteration.
6656700	6662060	And I believe each time you buy a new version of the game, you have to do it all over again.
6662060	6664940	Friends and repeat.
6664940	6667220	Well, we'll see what comes to this.
6667220	6670700	Maybe, maybe this game will get banned in countries.
6670700	6675080	We talked about like how they like, even like the switch version of the game was just kind
6675080	6677080	of, it literally was a roster update.
6677080	6682220	Like they, they had found, there was a video that had actually found that there was the
6682220	6688620	previous game's logo up in the stands and like, it's like, they didn't even bother to
6688620	6689620	just replace it.
6689620	6692060	It's like they scrubbed the game, but not very well.
6692060	6693060	Yes.
6693060	6694060	Yeah.
6694060	6695060	It's not good.
6695060	6696060	Yikes.
6696060	6697060	All right.
6697060	6698260	Well, let's, uh, let's move on.
6698260	6702740	Uh, we're going to talk about one more story here before we get to our discord segment
6702740	6707180	where we can, uh, talk to some folks that, uh, want to say hello and, and, uh, share
6707180	6710620	whatever topic they want to on the show over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
6710780	6714780	And I know one person in particular, an old favorite of the show wants to call in tonight
6714780	6716220	to talk about something.
6716220	6720200	So, um, I know we have that coming, so we'll have at least one call tonight for sure.
6720200	6723880	But before we get there, let's talk a little bit about the Sony PlayStation business and
6723880	6727660	how it's slowing and it's slowing a little faster than expected.
6727660	6731340	Now hold on, because that might, you know, if, if I were to leave it at a headline length
6731340	6734620	there or the type of thing that somebody might post on Facebook, you might kind of have a
6734620	6735620	reaction to that.
6735620	6739220	But I think if you sit down and logically think about it, well, we know the PlayStation
6739220	6743140	four is wrapping up and the PlayStation five is coming.
6743140	6748540	So people are probably waiting on their PlayStation four purchases to just buy a PlayStation five
6748540	6749600	when it comes out.
6749600	6754060	This is not anything we haven't seen before, right?
6754060	6759340	But I guess it's being reported on because it's slowing down perhaps maybe a little slower
6759340	6764340	or maybe a little, sorry, it's slowing faster than people were potentially anticipating.
6764460	6769180	Um, talking about the third quarter fiscal year, which would be the actual end of the
6769180	6775100	calendar year, October to 30, uh, October 1st, December 31st, sales were down by 20%
6775100	6780640	due to a decrease in PlayStation four hardware and third party software sales, uh, operating
6780640	6782420	income was also down.
6782420	6788860	Uh, and this is all, uh, from a, um, report, uh, a financial, uh, disclosure.
6788860	6794420	Um, and, uh, so the company has adjusted their financial forecast, dropping the outlook for
6794420	6799020	sales by 50 billion yen and the operating income by 5 billion yen, because of course
6799020	6804580	Sony is a Japanese company reports these numbers in, in, uh, Japanese ways, um, and figures.
6804580	6809220	Um, so, uh, you know, I mean, it's kind of one of the things where it's like, okay, it's
6809220	6811540	slowing down, but is anybody really that surprised?
6811540	6815700	Because of course the PlayStation fives on the horizon and did Sony really have a huge
6815700	6818180	holiday game this last year?
6818180	6821140	I feel like was Spider-Man this last year.
6821140	6822140	I don't even know.
6822140	6823140	Spider-Man was September.
6823140	6827260	I mean, I guess that's technically fourth quarter, but that's, I mean, I feel, I still
6827260	6831620	feel like that isn't as big of a game as some of the other big things that Sony puts out.
6831620	6836420	You know, especially from them skipping E3, we kind of knew we know some titles that were
6836420	6841660	expected got pushed back like last of us to final fantasy seven remake and some things
6841660	6844920	that I think a lot of us are sitting here going, are they just going to release those
6844920	6847060	on PlayStation five at this point?
6847060	6851620	And I think truly the answer is these games will play on your PlayStation five because
6851620	6854480	you already know PS five is going to play PS four games because they're showing off
6854480	6857780	Spider-Man on the PlayStation five to show up, to show the times.
6857780	6861860	So I think they will definitely make a case for, you can play these games on your PlayStation
6861860	6867020	five and they will run bigger, better, faster, stronger, harder type of thing.
6867020	6869140	Well, that's nice.
6869140	6874340	I like being able to play my library, especially since I have a bunch of stuff on PlayStation
6874340	6875340	four already.
6875340	6880660	Um, although I do kind of want a new X-Box thing, I don't know, uh, Y Y R says, isn't
6880660	6885380	it slowing faster than expected because there aren't many big exclusives left to release
6885380	6889500	and wants to make sure I pick up, he said, aren't many not aren't any.
6889500	6891440	And I think that absolutely does play into it.
6891440	6895700	We know it's slowing down on the Sony side and I think most people that wanted to get
6895700	6900460	a PlayStation four probably have at this point and SSG 100 Matt brings up game sales outside
6900460	6904660	of a few outliers were down last year from what I understand switch dominated the market
6904660	6905660	for sure.
6905660	6908660	And that probably plays into it as well is that there's probably a lot of families out
6908660	6912960	there that around the holiday time probably picked up a switch as their console of choice
6912960	6916940	and passed on maybe getting a PlayStation four for whatever reason, whether it's just
6916940	6921460	the cutie Nintendo factor or it just fits better in their home or just the fact that
6921460	6923140	again, PlayStation five is looming.
6923140	6926620	So it's like, well, let's get the switch this year and then we'll get the PlayStation five
6926620	6930900	next year, which is why I think it's fascinating that Nintendo has come out and said no new
6930900	6932880	switch this year.
6932880	6936040	So I mean, obviously they just did that last week cause we reported on that last week.
6936040	6939560	So I didn't affect holiday numbers, but it is interesting to see that they've said that.
6939560	6943880	So people now are kind of free to think, Oh, well maybe I can get a PlayStation five cause
6943880	6947360	there's not going to be a new switch for me to buy or an Xbox series X, whatever it is
6947360	6952080	that you're into or upgrading my PC, which some people will do.
6952080	6955380	Now it's not like all this news is terrible for Sony.
6955380	6957480	It should be pointed out.
6957480	6964720	PlayStation plus subscriber service is up increased to 38.8 million from 36.3 million
6964720	6966160	this time last year.
6966160	6968460	So there is that little silver lining.
6968460	6971820	That's still quite the increase in those subscribers.
6971820	6975560	And just this month I noticed my PlayStation four, I pulled down the Bioshock collection.
6975560	6977800	That seems like a pretty big game to be released.
6977800	6980320	It's actually, it's two separate games.
6980320	6981320	It's there.
6981320	6984720	You get the Bioshock infinite cause they were probably two separate discs when they really,
6984720	6989440	but there's Bioshock infinite in one box on your manual and then Bioshock two on the
6989440	6990440	other box.
6990440	6991880	So kind of interesting.
6991880	6992880	I thought so.
6992880	6994880	All right.
6994880	6998480	So anyhow, do you think, I mean, do you think we're reading too much into that, that it's
6998480	7002120	kind of one of those, this really isn't a big deal and we'll, we'll just kind of see
7002120	7003120	what happens this year.
7003120	7005080	Cause I kind of feel like that's, that's where this ultimately ends up.
7005080	7007720	It's like, I mean, I don't want to read into everything.
7007720	7011560	I just, just give me the news and then they'll figure it out.
7011560	7013620	And I know I am all over that Final Fantasy seven remake.
7013620	7016140	I am so hyped for that remake.
7016140	7019700	I don't know if I've been hyped for a game this much in a long time.
7019700	7020700	I don't know.
7020700	7024260	I should feel like I should be more hyped for it, but I just, I'm like, not really even
7024260	7028500	I understand some of the cynicism and so forth, but it's like every time there's a new trailer
7028500	7031780	or do something like they just put out that trailer out of his last week or the week before
7031780	7035940	that showed like the honeybee and sequences and all that and I was like, Oh damn, like
7035940	7040240	this could have been massively fucking cringe and who knows it might still be, but at least
7040240	7045060	in the trailer, it looks like they nailed it and made it like appropriate for 2020.
7045060	7049880	And it's going to be like, and just, just the whole, and not just that scene, just the
7049880	7053960	way it all looks the whole game, just like, I'm like, dang, it's going to be like almost
7053960	7054960	an all new story.
7054960	7055960	I'm really hyped about it.
7055960	7057960	I really, really, it looks good.
7057960	7060860	All right, let's get to some calls.
7060860	7065800	So every week we invite you guys to call in on our discord server over at vognetwork.com
7065800	7067280	slash discord.
7067280	7071880	But I believe we have a very special caller already on the line waiting to chat with us.
7071880	7072880	Hello.
7072880	7073880	Are you there?
7073880	7074880	Caller?
7074880	7076600	You know, you don't have to butter me up, right?
7076600	7078600	I, of course I do.
7078600	7081960	I want to, I enjoy buttering my bread.
7081960	7082960	Why?
7082960	7084640	Why are, how are you doing my friend?
7084640	7086640	I was bred for this apparently.
7086640	7087960	I'm doing okay.
7087960	7088960	How are you?
7088960	7092160	You, you were born to make OLR dreams in reality.
7092160	7093160	Why?
7093160	7094420	Why are no, I'm doing great.
7094420	7095420	What is on your mind?
7095420	7096420	My friend?
7096420	7099780	Oh, well, let's see.
7099780	7105700	At work, we started our windows 10 rollout, so I'm spinning like a top there.
7105700	7111660	And then on the weekends and the evenings, when I have anything left in the tank, I am
7111660	7120540	doing my best to ramp up for the February 26th release of sharpshooter plus congratulations
7120540	7121700	on the release.
7121700	7123940	And you know, I believe we have some footage.
7123940	7125180	Should I roll that tape?
7125180	7128420	Oh, you absolutely should.
7128420	7131840	I will.
7131840	7132840	So it's going to be a delay.
7132840	7133840	It's rolling now.
7133840	7135860	Obviously you're not going to really be able to see it, but we are looking at the trailer
7135860	7137720	live on screen.
7137720	7142540	So basically I tried to convey with this minute and a half approximately trailer, which is
7142540	7149340	going to be the front thing on steam, um, that this is a straight up action packed shooting
7149340	7150340	game.
7150340	7151460	I just want to, I want to warn too.
7151460	7152460	It's very flashy.
7152460	7157300	Why we are, I don't know if that is an issue for people that might be susceptible to flashes,
7157300	7159100	but I just want to warn the viewer.
7159100	7160480	There are a lot of flashes.
7160480	7164120	So just, just if that is something that is, um, you shouldn't be looking at very flashy
7164120	7165120	things.
7165120	7166900	You might want to virtualize for just a moment.
7166900	7168540	Yeah, I guess that's true.
7168540	7170340	Um, yes.
7170340	7173980	So Oh, Bobby Black Wolf asks, will there be an epilepsy mode?
7173980	7179500	You know, in retrospect, I probably should put something in the options to disable the
7179500	7181260	flash when you shoot.
7181260	7185940	I mean, basically what it's supposed to do is emulate, Oh, it feels like the light gun
7185940	7186940	games used to.
7186940	7187940	Yeah.
7187940	7188940	Yeah.
7188940	7189940	You nailed that.
7189940	7190940	Like I totally get the aesthetic you're trying to go for here.
7190940	7191940	Like it makes sense.
7191940	7195300	But then I was like, Ooh, that I was like, Oh no, I wonder if that could be a thing.
7195300	7196300	Yeah.
7196300	7197300	So I'm glad, you know what?
7197300	7198300	I'm fucking glad we've talked about it here.
7198300	7200300	And now it's like, Oh yay.
7200300	7201300	Accessibility.
7201300	7202300	Yay.
7202300	7206260	Oh, and then I'd re-render the trailer says Bobby Black Wolf in chat.
7206260	7209500	Uh, yeah, I guess that's not a bad idea.
7209500	7210500	Hmm.
7210740	7212740	Well, um, yeah.
7212740	7213740	Okay.
7213740	7214740	Thanks again.
7214740	7215740	But let's talk about it.
7215740	7219020	Cause it does look awesome because I know it feels it's, it's filling a void and I'll
7219020	7220020	go back.
7220020	7221020	The trailer's done.
7221020	7222020	So I'll go back to the main shot.
7222020	7226820	Um, I, uh, I feel like it's definitely filling a void that has been left by games like point
7226820	7229140	blank and these games that I used to love.
7229140	7232180	I feel like sharp shooter is, is kind of filling that niche.
7232180	7233180	Is that what you're aiming for?
7234180	7241700	It, I mean, basically this game is, um, it's basically my version of a point blank or a
7241700	7243260	police trainer.
7243260	7246820	It's uh, it's got 20 separate mini games.
7246820	7253060	It randomizes them, uh, you know, for every time you play, there's five different difficulty
7253060	7254060	levels.
7254060	7257660	And then within those, it adjusts as you're playing, the better you're doing, the harder
7257660	7258660	it gets.
7258660	7260500	So it increases the scoring potential.
7260660	7265580	Um, yeah, it's, uh, I basically use those as my direct inspiration.
7265580	7272020	The biggest difference from those games is instead of giving you a set number of lives
7272020	7280100	and then killing one each time, uh, you mess up or you fail to reach a goal, the, um, instead
7280100	7286980	what happens is you get 10,000 points each time you complete a game, you don't get that
7286980	7290940	10,000 points if you fail to achieve the quota.
7290940	7296420	And then at the end of the game, you're given a grade based on your score.
7296420	7301060	And so if you fail to complete too many goals, you're going to get saddled with a C or a
7301060	7305500	D, you know, and there's no way to go back and try it again.
7305500	7314700	So yeah, at least if I got a D, I still passed, I mean, it's, it's, uh, it's up to you what
7314700	7320260	you consider passing, but I don't think I even put an F in there.
7320260	7321260	To be honest.
7321260	7322980	Uh, what's the lowest grade you can get.
7322980	7324300	I should check that.
7324300	7330460	I'm not sure I put in anything below a D to be honest, but if you, if you, if you flame,
7330460	7334860	if you flame out completely, like you don't even score a point, Loki's face should just
7334860	7338180	pop up as the grade.
7338180	7339740	I think I'll forego that.
7339740	7341640	All right, fine.
7341640	7343440	You have, you have more important feedback to take away.
7343440	7346320	Maybe you're going to have to just update it when I actually do finish something.
7346320	7347320	No problem.
7347320	7348320	All right.
7348320	7355520	I know he's listening, but I was actually seriously flirting with the idea.
7355520	7360900	I don't think I'm going to do it, but I was cause the steam support, it can see your username.
7360900	7369340	So I was actually, um, uh, flirting with the idea of for Bobby Black Wolf only renaming
7369380	7375660	the easiest difficulty, Bobby Black Wolf.
7375660	7380540	I think you should still do it.
7380540	7381540	I didn't.
7381540	7382540	Okay.
7382540	7383540	You can do that on steam.
7383540	7385900	You can like codify messages to people.
7385900	7390420	So like if, if I know Loki O L R is playing my game, I could send a message that says,
7390420	7391820	Hey, screw you buddy.
7391820	7392820	Or something like that.
7392820	7396580	And that's kind of crazy.
7396580	7400140	I mean, all you have to do is basically say, Oh, what's their username.
7400140	7401140	Is it this?
7401140	7402140	Okay.
7402140	7404480	Then put that up instead of this.
7404480	7405480	How funny.
7405480	7406480	All right.
7406480	7409400	Well, that's, that's, I love it, but yeah, the game's got, I mean, for those in the podcast
7409400	7413300	feed that weren't able to see the trailer, the game obviously has like a very, your,
7413300	7418560	your, um, your games have a very unique kind of retro style to them that feel very like
7418560	7421900	an arcade game of the late eighties sort of look to them.
7421900	7423540	That's exactly what I'm doing.
7423540	7424540	Yeah.
7424580	7426900	I want to do an arcade game basically.
7426900	7427900	Yeah.
7427900	7431300	And it, you got it.
7431300	7436300	So I mean, it's what I still enjoy playing the most arcade games.
7436300	7438420	So that's exclusively what I do.
7438420	7442780	So yeah, I'm, I'm hoping to bring the arcade experience to you.
7442780	7451660	And so, you know, as much as is practical to do within today's modern you know, platforms.
7451660	7457900	And I think the most exciting thing about this version of the game is that you can play
7457900	7464100	on a controller if you want to, but you can also pick up a mouse or the best one is touchscreen.
7464100	7468340	If you've got a touchscreen computer or a touchscreen connected to your computer, it's
7468340	7469660	super fun.
7469660	7474220	And I ramp up the difficulty to account for the fact that you have 10 guns as opposed
7474220	7475780	to the usual one.
7475780	7478980	Yeah, I definitely want to try this in a touchscreen mode.
7478980	7480980	That sounds really, really fun.
7480980	7484060	Even though yes, of course, the difficulty is going to be a lot harder.
7484060	7488740	I always thought, you know, mouse and keyboard is a, or excuse me, mouse, specifically is
7488740	7493020	is a decent, you know, alternative when you know, you're limited on the research you have.
7493020	7498460	Obviously PCs don't have light gun attachments very easy or like that everybody has.
7498460	7500540	But I think the mouse works.
7500540	7505540	And I think, because I played Sharpshooter when you had it on Xbox 360, on the indie
7505540	7506540	games thing.
7506540	7509100	You know, the controller worked, you did, you did a good job with that.
7509100	7513940	But it's just, you know, that type of game just feels better with something you have
7513940	7517740	a little more control over like a mouse, or like a touchscreen.
7517740	7519460	I think it's gonna be great.
7519460	7522300	Yeah, I had it running on touchscreen at magfest.
7522300	7528240	And I had tried showing sharpshooter before at a few previous conventions, and no one
7528240	7529800	really took a look at it.
7529800	7534260	But when it was on touchscreen, I had people playing it all throughout the weekend and
7534260	7535940	really enjoying it.
7535940	7538700	And a few people actually throwing money at it.
7538700	7542220	So I, it's, it's definitely fun.
7542220	7548300	And I hope that a lot of people get to try the touchscreen mode, because it's, it's definitely
7548300	7549300	special.
7549300	7553460	And I'm going to be spending a lot of time over the next two weeks, really polishing
7553460	7554460	the difficulty.
7554460	7557860	I want to make it so that anyone can enjoy it.
7557860	7563900	But only the most dedicated will see that AAA top grade on the master difficulty.
7563900	7565100	All right.
7565260	7570620	Well, I hope folks will check this out when it releases the date again, February 20, what
7570620	7571620	was it?
7571620	7575120	Well, about that.
7575120	7578340	So here's the thing.
7578340	7580780	I have to test leaderboards.
7580780	7586740	It's really tough to test leaderboards when you're only one person.
7586740	7592340	So you know, you could wait till February 26 and buy it.
7592340	7597300	Or I could just gift it to everybody in chat right now.
7597300	7601060	And yeah, you guys can help me test the leaderboards.
7601060	7602060	Oh, snap.
7602060	7603060	All right.
7603060	7604780	Well, sign me up, my friend.
7604780	7607020	I definitely want to check that out.
7607020	7610420	And you know, hopefully you'll get through this process in this couple weeks, some other
7610420	7614440	like good feedback, like obviously, you know, I think you've heard the message on the flashing
7614440	7618940	thing loud and clear, you know, and yes, there'll be other things perhaps that maybe you didn't
7618940	7621220	even think of that other folks will discover as well.
7621220	7625380	And that'll help you make it even better product for when this releases.
7625380	7626620	I'm excited for you.
7626620	7632140	Yeah, I mean, the anti epilepsy thing that's going at the top of my list, I'm going to
7632140	7635140	get that done quick and then game balance.
7635140	7642860	But yeah, if you are on Twitch right now, watching, just expect a whisper from me within
7642860	7645020	about five minutes with a code.
7645020	7652820	And please go ahead and try just the standard mode in mouse or touchscreen just so that
7652820	7657900	the yeah, I get at least 10 things on a leaderboard so I can try scrolling pages and make sure
7657900	7658900	it works.
7658900	7659900	All right.
7659900	7663340	Well, if you really I know what if you really want to give me money for the game.
7663340	7667040	Yeah, if you really want to give me money for the game instead, then just don't redeem
7667040	7668040	the code.
7668040	7670320	You can pass it to somebody else if you'd like.
7670320	7671540	What if we want to do both?
7671540	7673640	What if I want to play it now but still give you money?
7673640	7679040	Is there is there like a PayPal a coffee a patreon something?
7679040	7687040	If you go to my personal website, hi, Aaron calm, I believe, either on the front or on
7687040	7689640	the helpful code page.
7689640	7695400	There's a PayPal link where I say if you want to contribute to my daughter's college fund,
7695400	7696600	you can do it there.
7696600	7697600	Perfect.
7697600	7700200	Or just go by super multitasking if you haven't already.
7700200	7702200	Yes, that you absolutely should do.
7702200	7703200	Oh, s2100.
7703200	7704200	I'm out with a great point.
7704200	7705840	Buy the game for a friend.
7705840	7706840	Perfect.
7706840	7708200	You can do that.
7708200	7709680	I mean, cool.
7709680	7710680	Thank you.
7710680	7711680	All right.
7711680	7712680	Well, thank you.
7712680	7713680	Why?
7713680	7718000	Why are you've been a huge supporter of the show for a long time and I yeah, I can't that
7718000	7722720	you know what you know what our pals over at gamertag radio, they might have got an interview
7722720	7725520	with Phil Spencer this week, which is a great thing.
7725520	7726720	We're really happy for him.
7726720	7732120	But you know, we got we got everybody a free YY our game who's listening to you know what
7732120	7734760	sometimes sometimes we get to do special things here as well.
7734760	7738200	I will take it very happy to have you here.
7738200	7739600	And I'll just mention real quick.
7739600	7740600	If you have a Mac.
7740600	7741600	I'm sorry.
7741600	7742600	The Mac build isn't up yet.
7742600	7744240	Hopefully within a few days.
7744240	7747580	Dark Sakura left a little early tonight, so you're safe for now.
7747580	7748580	But get working.
7748580	7749580	All right.
7749580	7751860	No, I've been working on it.
7751860	7754440	It's been a little tricky, but I got it running today.
7754440	7755440	Oh, good.
7755440	7756440	Well, that's great.
7756440	7757440	You're even considering it.
7757440	7758920	I'm sure she'll be happy to hear that.
7758920	7759920	All right.
7759920	7760920	Cool.
7761280	7766180	Thank you as always for allowing me to plug my stuff and thank you for the giveaway.
7766180	7767180	Why?
7767180	7768180	Why are that's amazing.
7768180	7770400	I hope the testing proves very fruitful for you.
7770400	7771400	Yeah, me too.
7771400	7772400	All right.
7772400	7773400	Take care.
7773400	7774400	Thanks for being here.
7774400	7775400	Welcome.
7775400	7776400	Yep.
7776400	7777400	Have fun.
7777400	7781000	Oh, one more thing, because I need to ask, because you know, this is on my mind.
7781000	7783920	Can I live stream the game before it releases?
7783920	7784920	Sure.
7784920	7785920	Go right ahead.
7785920	7788760	And that goes for anybody else in the chat.
7788760	7790880	If you want to stream the game, go right ahead.
7790880	7791840	Nice.
7791840	7792840	Look at that.
7792840	7793840	Exclusives for you streamers out there.
7793840	7794840	All right.
7794840	7795840	Well, thanks.
7795840	7796840	And thanks for listening to the feedback too.
7796840	7801040	It's a really great thing to be able to have that live and interactive and be receptive
7801040	7802040	to that.
7802040	7803040	So thanks, my friend.
7803040	7804040	And you know what?
7804040	7806160	I don't think that should be just an option in the options menu.
7806160	7810680	I think something should appear when you run the game for the first time that says, you
7810680	7812780	know, are you sensitive to flashes?
7812780	7814560	Do you want to turn this off?
7814560	7817040	Like I don't even want to give them the chance to get a seizure.
7817040	7818880	I want them to turn it off right away.
7818880	7822160	So yeah, I'm going to get on that.
7822160	7823160	Love it.
7823160	7824160	This call was such a win tonight.
7824160	7825160	This is such a win.
7825160	7826160	I guess so.
7826160	7827160	Love it.
7827160	7828160	Take care, my friend.
7828160	7829160	Hey, have a great week.
7829160	7830160	All right.
7830160	7831160	You too.
7831160	7832160	Bye bye.
7832160	7833160	Yep.
7833160	7834160	Bye bye.
7834160	7835160	All right.
7835160	7836160	All right.
7836160	7837160	Awesome to hear from YYR.
7837160	7841240	I'll leave open the green room there if anybody else wants to get in there very quickly.
7841240	7845400	And yeah, I love the obsolete woman in chat says, as an epileptic, I want to thank you
7845400	7846400	for taking this seriously.
7846400	7847400	Heck yeah.
7847400	7850680	Like, you know, and this is, this is when we talk about like accessibility and games
7850680	7854880	and all that stuff, you know, sometimes it's not always the first things that come to mind
7854880	7855880	necessarily.
7855880	7859560	Like I, I totally understand the effect YYR was going there for with the, you know, cause
7859560	7862600	like when you play duck hunt, the screen flashes when you do it.
7862600	7867320	But yeah, like, you know, obviously like, Oh, now that everything is like high def and
7867320	7870600	stuff, it might have a different kind of effect in some people and so forth.
7870600	7876000	So I think it's, it's great that, you know, he's like so quick to go, Oh, Oh crap.
7876000	7877240	We do need to do something about that.
7877240	7878240	Don't we?
7878240	7879240	And he's going to get on that.
7879240	7881520	So I made a game like sharpshooter one time.
7881520	7887080	What's that in click and play long time ago, it was a game called shoot first, ask questions
7887080	7888080	later.
7888080	7889960	I remember something like this.
7889960	7890960	Yes.
7890960	7895320	But, uh, that got lost at the winds of time unfortunately.
7895320	7899640	Cause I don't even, I, one, I didn't even have anything that I think click and play
7899640	7900640	could run on too.
7900640	7903480	I have no idea where that those files are anymore.
7903480	7907080	And they like, that's like four or five computers ago.
7907080	7908080	Yeah.
7908080	7909080	So, all right.
7909080	7910880	Um, well I don't see anybody else in the green room.
7910880	7913800	I'll give it just a couple more minutes just in case I want to check in and see if there's
7913800	7919200	any last minute stories though, before we, uh, close up shop for a real, um, no, not
7919200	7920200	really.
7920200	7925420	I mean, there was a, uh, like at this art, I saw this, uh, story about some Korean TV
7925420	7931800	special called meeting you where they're talking about this woman meeting her, uh, rip of the,
7931800	7937680	they recreated her daughter who had died, um, her seven year old daughter.
7937680	7939240	And it just seems all sorts of creepy.
7939240	7942480	I mean, cool that she wanted to do that, but no thanks.
7942480	7943480	So.
7943480	7944480	Huh?
7944480	7950400	Well, this, it kind of goes back to the art is expression games or art type of thing where
7950400	7954580	even though it might be like very uncomfortable, um, if this is how somebody wants to kind
7954580	7959640	of grieve and be expressive, it's a very, it's a unique way to do that.
7959640	7960920	We'll say that, you know?
7960920	7963360	So yeah, very, very different.
7963360	7968840	Um, now Shane is in our chat room, uh, or shad stars, it cause he goes by on Twitch
7968840	7972880	saying new space channel five trailer came out and it's awesome.
7972880	7973880	Yeah.
7973880	7974880	You know what?
7974880	7978520	I saw the tweet just before we went live tonight, so unfortunately I haven't seen it yet, but
7978520	7981060	uh, I'm very, this is the VR one if I'm not mistaken.
7981060	7985540	So there's a trailer for that out there and I'd honestly, I'm sure the trailer is great,
7985540	7989000	but I don't need a trailer to convince me I'm going to buy the game right out the gate
7989000	7990000	anyway.
7990080	7994240	Um, yeah, I'm very excited to see that that is happening.
7994240	7995240	Very cool.
7995240	7996240	All right.
7996240	7998300	Well, it doesn't look like we have any, um, oops, it doesn't look like we have any further
7998300	8002040	calls on discord tonight, so we'll go ahead and close it up over there.
8002040	8005440	And I think with that, we'll probably move to a wrap up for the night.
8005440	8008860	So, um, that does it for another week here at orange launch radio.
8008860	8012120	Thank you guys for tuning into our program and checking us out.
8012120	8015240	If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, help us spread the word because
8015240	8016960	we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8016960	8020760	But if the game, if the voices aren't here to put out on the air, then, uh, you know,
8020760	8022240	we can't get them.
8022240	8024360	So, uh, support independent broadcasting.
8024360	8026880	Of course, I think is a clear message from tonight as well.
8026880	8029960	Um, uh, and help us spread the word about OLR for sure.
8029960	8034640	A nice five star review on a place where you can get this show such as iTunes goes an awful
8034640	8037600	long way, or even just like sharing the Spotify link to the show.
8037600	8040880	Cause we're on Spotify now, if you haven't heard on social media, that type of stuff
8040880	8042880	goes a very long way.
8042880	8043880	So thank you.
8043880	8045920	Thank you for everybody that participates with that.
8045920	8048200	And with that, we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.
8048200	8050160	Um, Loki, your final thought tonight?
8050160	8054560	Uh, my final thought is I need to work more on my game.
8054560	8059600	Uh, my final thought tonight is, uh, you remember the survivor LARP I talked about last summer
8059600	8060600	that I ended up winning?
8060600	8061600	Yeah, yeah.
8061600	8063480	So they finally started the next cycle of that.
8063480	8067720	So there's 18 new people playing that just started two nights ago, but this time I'm
8067720	8068720	on the other side of it.
8068720	8072240	I'm helping to run the game, although I'm not doing nearly as much as the other hard
8072240	8073680	working people behind the scenes are doing.
8073680	8079040	I'm just kind of lending my personality and stuff where I can, uh, but it's so interesting
8079040	8080400	to watch from the other side.
8080400	8085560	And that being said, I probably have about 45 notifications on Skype right now.
8085560	8087520	I need to go clear out at some point.
8087520	8088520	All right.
8088520	8089520	That's it.
8089520	8091160	Thank you guys for checking out the show and listening.
8091160	8092160	Good night everybody.
