76160	80760	And then in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network Tigerclaw is pointing out
80760	83680	it's also National Hedgehog Day.
83680	88120	Why am I not surprised to hear that from the Sonic the Hedgehog movie's biggest fan?
88120	89480	Techmaster Loki has some input.
89480	90480	Hi, Loki.
90480	91480	I don't have any input.
91480	92480	Oh.
92480	93480	You stopped making up all these holidays.
93480	95480	It's not Hedgehog Day, it's Groundhog Day.
95480	101600	Yeah, I know it's, it's, it's, hi Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers, but I guess is it because hedgehogs
101600	105000	are adjacent to groundhogs?
105000	106000	I don't know.
106000	110280	No, they're kind of not even the same genus, I think.
110280	112360	I don't know if that's going to pick you up unless you hold that news.
112360	114880	We're trying out a new mic stand approach thing today.
114880	115880	But I think how's that?
115880	116880	Yeah, it's good.
116880	118760	It puts my head on cam.
118760	121320	You might have to just kind of pick it up and hold it that way.
121320	122320	So all right.
122320	123320	Yeah.
123320	124320	Anyhow.
124320	128280	Um, so I don't even know what to ask at the top of the show because we have a we kind
128280	130280	of like a lighter turnout than usual.
130280	134640	There's no Bobby to kind of start the viewing bandwagon here at VOG Network tonight.
134640	138640	There's that football game on television, which I I don't even know who's playing.
138640	141480	I want No, I do one of them San Francisco.
141480	145440	Because everybody here is losing their shit.
145440	146440	Exactly.
146440	150280	Because the local team Well, I hope I hope they're sporting well and made the best sports
150280	151280	or win.
151280	154360	Um, anyhow, we're gonna get into video games, though.
154360	156080	Let's just jump right into it.
156080	160200	Let's talk about what's going on here at the top of the show with some of the news about
160200	166200	Warcraft three reforged Have you guys heard about Yeah, you're forged.
166200	167960	It's not a game I'm really interested in.
167960	173160	I didn't play a whole lot of the Warcraft RTS games aside from like maybe demos that
173160	176640	came with PC gamer.
176640	181320	But I hear that a lot of the stuff that they promised to fix and update and change on this
181320	182320	never happened.
182320	186940	Like, for example, they promised, you know, completely redone cutscenes and everything
186940	187940	in the game.
187940	190040	And apparently, they're exactly the same as they used to be.
190040	194380	Well, I thought some of that was intentional because when they originally revealed this
194380	198900	at BlizzCon, they said that Christy golden, who did a lot of the books was going to be
198900	202500	writing like kind of rewriting some of the dialogue to kind of match.
202500	207060	Well, they actually showed like the you cut some of the cutscenes like one of the cutscenes
207060	208900	in the game was actually in the trailer.
208900	212620	And it was like a very cinematic cutscene like they were going to be completely redoing
212620	213980	the way the cutscenes were.
213980	219580	And that's not what it looks like in the game interest or like redoing the the UI.
219580	222220	And that's not really a thing either.
222220	227820	And it seems like the only like some of the stuff in the game, like I'm trying to think
227820	232780	of all the like bullet points other people have said, like, I think the movement in the
232780	239660	game is like it it's locked down to 20 FPS or whatever, like the actual like unit movement
239660	240660	or whatever.
240660	241660	Yeah.
241660	242660	Which is kind of weird.
242660	246060	And then what was the other thing?
246060	250420	So the really the main thing that's been kind of like redone or whatever is like the graphics
250420	253060	which were outsourced to another company.
253060	257340	And then, of course, the wonderful brand new terms of service that can't miss out any of
257340	263260	that dota money clause, basically saying that, hey, anything they make for Warcraft three,
263260	264580	it's ours.
264580	268380	The thing that really and I just want to give full disclosure, OK, because I don't necessarily
268380	272180	want to totally dunk on this game because the reality is I have not played Warcraft
272180	273360	three reforge.
273360	278100	So I more just want to discuss some of like what I'm hearing about it online, because
278100	281820	it's somewhat making me apprehensive to want to, you know, I've had the Blizzard launcher
281820	285020	not on my computer for a little bit ever since some of the stuff that went on last year.
285020	286820	You know, we kind of talked about that.
286820	291220	I have still not really played Blizzard stuff, so they're refusing refunds to.
291220	295540	But I was thinking about getting into Warcraft three reforge because I remember I liked Warcraft
295540	296540	one.
296540	297540	I like Warcraft two.
297540	300180	Warcraft three came out at a time in my life when I wasn't really gaming.
300180	302460	So I was thinking maybe reforge would be a good time to pick it up.
302460	307460	But all this reaction I'm hearing is making me very apprehensive to pick it up.
307460	310700	And I'm kind of very curious about your guys's thoughts in our chat over at Twitch TV slash
310700	314140	VOG Network for those that are here tonight, especially if you have played Warcraft three
314140	315140	reforge.
315140	316580	I'm kind of curious about your reaction.
316580	320000	Is the Internet tending to overblow this out of proportion?
320000	322700	Because let's be real, that sometimes happens.
322700	326340	You know, for example, I would say a lot of the hysteria that went with Pokemon Sword
326340	331040	and Shield at the end of the day, it's the best fucking Pokemon generation I've played.
331040	335660	So I you know, you can't always trust the Internet polls.
335660	338140	But the reality is there's a lot of talk about this.
338140	342460	And what does take me by surprise, and I'll say this, what kind of takes me by surprise
342460	346460	with all this Warcraft three news is what they did to the old client.
346460	349260	I had no idea that this was happening.
349260	354980	So they've essentially, I guess, disabled the old client when it comes to online play.
354980	358480	You can still play offline Warcraft in the old client.
358480	362980	But if you want to play online, you have to get reforged.
362980	367580	But I think, like, I don't want to misstate it, because I believe you don't have to necessarily
367580	372940	spend the $30 because you own the old one, you just have to buy or you have to download
372940	377380	the problem people are having is that the old Warcraft three was like one gig, the new
377380	378740	one is like 28 gigs.
378740	382800	So you're having to download this new one so you can play online, which you can do without
382800	383800	having to buy it.
383800	388100	So it's not like they held everybody's old copy of Warcraft ransom.
388100	392980	But if you want to play the story mode in Warcraft three reforged and all that, then
392980	398680	you do have to pay the money to the 30 bucks or whatever in order to be able to do that.
398680	404660	And it's I'm kind of surprised that they just really kicked the old client in the shin like
404660	409560	that, because I always kind of got the impression that, you know, the people that were still
409560	415560	playing Warcraft three here in the year 2020, before reforged was out, probably weren't
415560	418240	interested in what reforged had to bring to the table.
418240	423620	So the fact that they disabled the old client, and now you have these terms of service about
423620	428680	you don't own your mod, that part is the part that I think is a little bit like even more
428680	432840	yikes, because now it's Oh, not only do you have to get on a new client, but now you have
432840	439240	to accept the terms of service that are going to say that we have a, I don't want to misappropriate,
439240	443700	but I believe it's that they have a stake in and you not even a sick, they fully own
443700	448100	anything that you create with it, including the fact that they can demand that you make
448100	454900	more like documents available for something and that like, continued work has to be done
454900	455900	on these things.
455900	456900	I don't know.
456900	462860	But it's very like aggressive the terms of service, which to me, if I was a modder, I
462860	465700	wouldn't be even interested in touching that stuff.
465700	470220	I've already decided that I'm not going back to anything Blizzard or Activision has their
470220	472000	fingers in.
472000	475280	I'm sticking to those guns and I have zero interest in this.
475280	481740	If I'm going to play Warcraft, I have a CD or DVD in my house that I could play.
481740	486500	And if I need to emulate something to make it work, I can, I can watch the stuff online,
486500	489680	but they are not getting my money, especially now.
489680	493520	Well, what's shocking about this in some ways is that for the most part, dark soccer, what
493520	496600	you're saying, yes, you could play Warcraft one, you could play Warcraft two, you could
496600	499000	play Warcraft three story mode on your DVD.
499000	502160	But the minute you tried to play Warcraft three online, which is probably, I know you
502160	505240	don't play a lot of games online, probably not something you would do anyway, but the
505240	509000	minute you tried to do that, you can't do that now without this new reforge client.
509000	510500	Well be doing it, don't care.
510500	515940	But that's, but, but I mean, for the fact, I mean, what's, how do I, how do I eloquently
515940	516940	put this?
516940	520320	The fact that you're saying for the most part, I could go back to my old games and I can
520320	521960	go enjoy my old games.
521960	527520	You kind of can't, if you are an online gamer, let's say we have an alternate universe where
527520	534640	dark Sakura is a Warcraft three online troll, and she loves to play online and put man babies
534640	535640	in their place.
535640	543520	Well, I do that anyway, but the reality is for my situation, I don't give a fuck.
543520	547560	I know, but isn't that, isn't it kind of screwed up that maybe the alternate soft or alternate
547560	551800	universe dark Sakura who does enjoy multiplayer gaming can't do it for Warcraft three without
551800	555040	this new client, then there's better games.
555040	556600	There are other games that will do this.
556600	562520	If you want the lore, read the fucking books, maybe, but in the end, sometimes you've got
562520	564800	to put your stuff, your foot down.
564800	565800	Yeah.
565800	571080	Sometimes you have to just say, you know, I am done like me and Facebook.
571080	574980	Interesting that you talk about the alternate, the, the, what you just said about go find
574980	578120	something else to play, because I don't think it made our show roll this week because I
578120	582320	can't remember if it happened in this last week or the week before, but we just had news
582320	587480	about torchlight and torchlight came out with some really big news that there, I forget
587480	591120	the original name of it now, but essentially their expansion, distant worlds or whatever
591120	592120	it was called.
592120	596520	So I know that wasn't the name, sorry, but they rebranded it as torchlight three and
596520	601240	it's going to be a traditional buy it once you get everything like it's the type of game
601240	606160	that, you know, because originally the original model was like a free to play microtransactions
606160	607160	driven thing.
607160	611320	Essentially the audience said, we'd rather not, thanks.
611320	616640	And they listened to their fan base and have reverted now to, okay, it's just torchlight
616640	621560	three and it's just like torchlight one and two, but with all the things you would expect
621560	624520	if we put the number three in front of it, new classes, new maps, blah, blah, blah,
624520	625520	blah, blah.
625520	628400	Now, if this was an Activision product, they would still charge you for the game and then
628400	634220	still, you know, why should we pick one model to business model to go with?
634220	638300	We can just charge you the $60 and charge you all the microtransactions like it was
638300	641460	a free to play game because we're Activision and fuck you.
641460	645420	Okay, so I'm going to turn to the chat room now because again, admittedly it's, it's a
645420	650260	little unfair of me to sit here and dunk on Warcraft three when I haven't played it myself.
650260	653680	I want to see what you guys in our chat over at twitch TV slash fog network have to say
653680	658580	and quest Buster shedding a little light on some things saying, clan support is gone.
658580	661140	Competitive ranked match mating ladders are gone.
661140	662660	Native land support is gone.
662660	664380	Oh, that's huge too.
664380	665380	The land thing.
665380	668140	And I bet, uh, this was the thing that happened with Diablo as well.
668140	670140	I remember that you couldn't do land anymore.
670140	675860	You know, the only way you can play Diablo three on land unmodded on the Nintendo switch.
675860	676860	Think about it.
676860	677860	What is the Nintendo switch now?
677860	678860	It's Nintendo.
678860	679860	Yeah.
679860	685820	Anyway, sometimes being 10 years behind the curve on online helps Nintendo.
685820	691700	This is one of those times anyway, uh, where was I on quest posters, comments here, uh,
691700	693660	custom campaigns cannot be loaded.
693660	697500	So say goodbye to the last 17 years of player made content.
697500	702020	If the game fails to connect to blizzard servers for any reason, you can still boot into single
702020	705660	player, but you can't save your progress for some reason.
705660	707520	Oh my gosh.
707520	708720	Blizzard missed the dota boat.
708720	712100	So now they're like, we need to be more aggressive now.
712100	720020	So interesting point from quest buster and let's humor blizzard here for a minute.
720020	725420	Maybe part of the reason they want more ownership is because they didn't really get anything
725420	729240	out of defense of the ancients being a Warcraft three mod at the end of the day, because those
729240	733060	guys ended up going to valve and making dota two there.
733060	735440	I mean, yes, blizzard made their own.
735440	740700	There was originally blizzard dota, which then they got in that whole argument about
740700	742820	who owns the name dota, right?
742820	748300	And so blizzard made heroes of the storm, which was called blizzard dota at one point.
748300	753280	So this kind of begs the question, like blizzard being irritated that they couldn't have anything
753280	754280	behind.
754280	758220	Oh, they can't have all of the money where poor babies.
758220	764240	Oh, if only they had large franchises under their belt, I, I will humor that angle to
764240	767760	some extent on the basis that they're heroes of the storm.
767760	771180	So well, there would be, yeah, that's another issue.
771180	775620	There would be no dota without Warcraft three period, right?
775620	776960	You can't argue that.
776960	784560	So I can see it to that element, but to assert ownership over everything does feel a little
784560	786240	bit aggressive to me.
786240	787480	Like it just doesn't feel right.
787480	788480	It's a new game though.
788480	792600	They didn't like just repurpose Warcraft three for dota two.
792600	796560	They just built on, they rebuilt it from scratch.
796560	801440	So I'm sorry, you can't take ownership of a mod.
801440	802440	Yeah.
802440	803440	Yeah, I get it.
803440	806720	The original one was running in your engine or whatever, but now it's not.
806720	809600	So tough shit.
809600	810600	So I don't know.
810600	813560	This leaves me, this leaves me just feeling, I don't, I don't know.
813560	817920	Like I, isn't it, isn't, it's really like something to think that they should have ownership
817920	820800	of someone's own work, their mods.
820800	825480	Like I get it that it was a mod for a game or something, but that's not your work.
825480	828320	You may have built the tools for if you didn't want people making stuff with it, then don't
828320	833480	build the tools, but they, there would be no way there would be no shell for the tools
833480	836200	without their game, but I get it.
836680	844400	I understand, but you, in the end of the day, it comes down to that they're angry at themselves
844400	850880	for not putting more aggressive terms of use so that they could own other people's content.
850880	851880	I will agree with that.
851880	856800	Bethesda's doing now like, well, like Activision Blizzard's doing now.
856800	857800	That's pathetic.
857800	864760	I would say what this forcing the old Warcraft players to accept a new terms of service to
864800	872640	back park the car into ownership of mods that is way over the, that is not, that's overcompensating
872640	873640	what would have been.
873640	874640	And you know what?
874640	880120	It's great that we live in a time now where, you know, the easiest to make games as much
880120	881640	easier than it used to be.
881640	885600	And maybe some of these folks that are thinking about modding games like Warcraft three or
885600	888440	mastered whatever can decide, Hey, you know what?
888440	893240	Maybe instead I'll just go ahead and try something from scratch in like a unity or unreal engine
893240	896920	or something like that where I actually own the shit I'm putting together, which is what
896920	897920	Dota two is.
897920	898920	Exactly.
898920	904360	Uh, is that in our chat at Twitch TV slash vog network says derivative works, not copyright.
904360	909680	So when you get into something where you've modded the game extensively, uh, is it a derivative
909680	910680	work?
910680	914200	Now I'm not a legal expert, so I don't know to what extent a mod could claim, but I would
914200	923000	imagine if ultimately the name Dota ended up with valve with the original mod creators,
923000	926800	then the courts must have, or I don't know, I think it was a settlement, so there really
926800	932600	was no court ruling, but I was going to say things did air on the side of the mod owners
932600	935680	got to keep the name blizzard and keep that name.
935680	936680	They had to change it to here.
936680	940880	Well, I could especially like, like say, okay, yeah, you, you have ownership of this mod
940880	941880	now.
941880	943400	However, I'm making my own thing.
943400	946600	Dota two, you have no ownership of that.
946600	952880	And they're mad that they didn't get in on that train when they could too bad.
952880	955400	You had an opportunity to compete in that space.
955400	956800	You did it poorly.
956800	958240	What do you want?
958240	962760	And now they're practically guaranteeing that they're not going to have any major fan made
962760	968880	content apart from maybe just like something like deadly boss mods, the equivalent of something
968880	973080	like that helper tools, but no like actual full mods.
973080	980640	And in my opinion, uh, blizzard, I keep wanting to say blizzard Dota now heroes of the storm
980640	983680	for me was the strongest of all those Dota games.
983680	987920	I prefer it to Dota two and league of legends be quite simply on the basis.
987920	991340	I think it's the easiest one to grab with the least amount of micromanagement going
991340	998240	on in the game and the least toxic fans, um, which isn't saying much, but it is at least
998240	1000480	from my experience underlined bolded.
1000480	1005480	Uh, that is what I felt when I played heroes of the storm and it really wasn't until blizzard
1005480	1012280	themselves pretty much pulled it from a trajectory where it was going by saying, Oh, here's the
1012280	1013720	dorm is done up.
1013720	1014720	Here's the dorm.
1014720	1016320	That was the e-sports thing.
1016320	1017320	Yeah.
1017320	1020520	So they, they pulled that and they, they scaled way back on heroes of the storm, essentially
1020520	1024000	saying we're not going to support this on the level that we have been because at the
1024000	1026480	end of the day, it's not because the game was bad or anything.
1026480	1030800	It's because I can't make enough money off of the game because I'm a greedy fucking company
1030800	1032840	and corporation.
1032840	1040080	And that's what it is, is they wanted more money and sorry, sorry, you didn't make more
1040080	1041380	money.
1041380	1042380	You know what?
1042380	1043380	Too fucking bad.
1043380	1047180	It just, it just brings me to this kind of like closing thought on this topic, which
1047180	1050240	is like, what's, what's wrong blizzard?
1050240	1051240	What's what's wrong.
1051240	1052240	Do you guys need to talk?
1052240	1053240	Do you need a hug?
1053240	1058880	Like I, I feel like ever since Mike Morhaime left, it's just been, are you okay?
1058880	1060160	Are you okay?
1060160	1061160	Like honest.
1061160	1064080	Is this their call for, is it the employee's call for help?
1064080	1066160	Like the lawyers are like begging for help.
1066160	1067160	I don't know.
1067160	1068360	Like what's going on Bliss?
1068360	1073200	Like I, I'm at a loss.
1073200	1079720	I'm legit concerned for things like Diablo four and Overwatch two, which I mean, Overwatch
1079720	1084160	two has a whole nother controversy going on with that.
1084160	1087240	And you know, the whole expansion versus new game and all that.
1087240	1088760	I ain't here to touch that tonight.
1088760	1089760	That's a whole nother Oprah.
1089760	1092000	We can wait until the game is out to discuss that.
1092000	1093000	You know what it is?
1093000	1094400	If this was Oprah, we'd have free shit.
1094400	1099080	You're lucky that they're only charging $60 for an expansion or whatever it is.
1099080	1105260	But the reality is like, I'm losing more and more confidence in blizzard with every time
1105260	1108480	their name has come up on this program in the last year and a half.
1108480	1109480	And I've lost it.
1109480	1110480	I know.
1110480	1111480	I know.
1111480	1112480	I hear you.
1112480	1113480	I hear you.
1113480	1117560	And you know, you're somebody who spent a lot of time and money on world of Warcraft.
1117560	1121120	I'm somebody who spent a lot of time money on world of Warcraft used to have a blizzard
1121120	1122720	focused podcast.
1122720	1126300	I donated all of my paperbacks that I had spent money on.
1126300	1128040	The only ones I have are my hardcovers.
1128040	1132400	I only, I think still have my thrall book and like one other, and that's it.
1132400	1133400	Yeah.
1133400	1136640	Anyway, looking at some other comments from chat here, and then we'll move on to the next
1136640	1137640	topic.
1137640	1141220	Questbuster in chat says in a weird roundabout way, blizzard didn't have to change their
1141220	1142980	end user license agreement.
1142980	1146240	Any ideas that could have been mined from Warcraft three have been mined with Dota
1146240	1150960	and League of Legends, and any new games might instead take inspiration from those
1150960	1156620	as opposed to something 17 plus years old, but I guess they need everything.
1156620	1162680	And as that says, Activision wants that dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar.
1162680	1164760	Anyway, I don't know.
1164760	1171640	Like I just, I hope blizzard can figure out what they're doing wrong and how that's happening
1171640	1172640	on a management level.
1172640	1177320	Cause I know it ain't the frontline employees who work very hard on these visions, it ain't
1177320	1178320	them.
1178320	1179320	It's coming up.
1179320	1184800	The call is coming from inside the house and it's probably the biggest boardroom on the
1184800	1185800	campus.
1185800	1188480	It's management decisions that are screwing things up.
1188480	1196100	So I hope to hell blizzard can figure this out or it's going to just be sad trombone
1196100	1197680	every time their name comes up.
1197680	1203120	I firmly believe that when people get to the upper management level, they lose touch with
1203120	1208220	the common sense part of running a company and only look at things like market research
1208220	1211880	and don't think about how things are actually going to affect players unless you were dealing
1211880	1216920	only with brand recognition and using the Warcraft name as money.
1216920	1220480	Other than that, they're out of touch.
1220480	1225140	How many, how many hours a week do you think executives at video game companies spend playing
1225140	1226140	the games?
1226620	1229820	Not at all.
1229820	1230820	Some of them.
1230820	1232740	Some of them I would say do.
1232740	1236500	I would say Phil Spencer, head of X-Box plays a shit ton of X-Box.
1236500	1237500	I would say that.
1237500	1239700	But you, you get that from that guy.
1239700	1243780	He like how much has X-Box turned around since he took over?
1243780	1245460	You can tell who has the love.
1245460	1246460	Yes.
1246460	1249580	And then you can tell who has the love of money.
1249580	1251420	Like Don Mattrick who preceded him.
1251420	1252420	Yeah.
1252420	1253420	Anyway.
1253420	1254420	All right.
1254420	1255420	Well, let's move on.
1255700	1258580	What are some of the decisions that came out of Sega toward the end of their console days?
1258580	1259580	Yeah.
1259580	1260580	All right.
1260580	1261580	Let's move on.
1261580	1266260	Just I, all I can do, Blizzard and executives, I'm just going to send my thoughts and prayers
1266260	1268300	that you all figure it out.
1268300	1270180	Which we know just does jack shit.
1270180	1271180	So.
1271180	1273100	So this is on you guys to figure out.
1273100	1274100	All right.
1274100	1277700	Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have
1277700	1279220	been playing this week.
1279220	1282700	And while dark soccer starts her gaming week, I'm going to enjoy one of these cookies.
1282700	1284700	Is it a biscuit or is it a cookie?
1284980	1287380	So I'll hold it up in front of the camera real quick.
1287380	1288380	I already ate one.
1288380	1289380	So shut up.
1289380	1290380	Okay.
1290380	1291380	So what are they?
1291380	1292780	So she's holding up Viennese Whirls.
1292780	1293780	Ooh, vanilla.
1293780	1294780	Oh, they're actually.
1294780	1295780	They're actually.
1295780	1296780	Downton Abbey branded.
1296780	1299540	They're Downton Abbey branded cookies.
1299540	1301860	And yes, it says $4.99 on the package.
1301860	1304500	They were 30% off and I bought the fuck out of them.
1304500	1307260	I hope Judi Dench judges me as I eat one.
1307260	1308260	Okay.
1308260	1309260	Dame Judi Dench.
1309260	1313540	So I went to the whole reason I went to the world market was because they closed down
1313580	1315500	the one in Elk Grove.
1315500	1320340	And that's the only place I can find my Twinning's Lady Grey Tea, which I absolutely love and
1320340	1321980	I blame Tiara for.
1321980	1324260	So anyway.
1324260	1331900	I have been playing Animal Crossing in Pokemon Go, really.
1331900	1335100	I had a smattering of pinball.
1335100	1337620	You okay there, Rob?
1337620	1340420	So I had a smattering of pinball going on with this.
1340900	1346380	I've also been back to playing a lot of Patterned, just because I relaunched the game to play
1346380	1352060	it on my Mac and wanted to redo the puzzles and I'm doing all the new puzzles on my phone
1352060	1355020	as well and when I'm done with that, then I'll cry because I fucking love that game
1355020	1356500	and they need more puzzles.
1359340	1363420	I haven't, well, you know, I had that sinus infection and I was still pretty sick this
1363420	1367980	last week, so every time I was gonna sit down to play something in front of me, I was like,
1368020	1372300	ah, I'll play this, no I won't, I'll play, no I won't.
1372300	1378540	So it was just a bunch of that and just staring at my phone and playing the shit on there.
1378540	1381900	And then of course, the stuff that I wanted to play at home today, I could not.
1381900	1386780	I decided to not be at my house because of the superb owl.
1386780	1392540	So I am avoiding sports ball like it's a plague because it is.
1392540	1393540	Right now.
1393540	1394540	Mogi.
1394540	1397300	I actually played a few things this week.
1397300	1404860	I played Orna some more, so I'm level 122 and I did make it a point to actually play
1404860	1411740	a few other things, so I went back and booted up Minecraft, the Bedrock Edition, because
1411740	1416380	I was looking at, I'm still looking at doing a Bedrock server, but I wanted to research
1416380	1423420	more on how servers work on the Bedrock Edition, I haven't really done anything like that.
1423420	1424420	So I have to look and see.
1424420	1428900	I still have to figure out if the PlayStation 4 support servers currently, they just got
1428900	1434940	the Bedrock Edition in December, and I don't know if that was part of it, the server part.
1434940	1435940	So I'll have to see.
1435940	1441780	And then the other game, I picked up Deer Simulator, which I haven't played yet, but
1441780	1442780	that's, it's a really weird.
1442780	1444940	Is that the game they have at every Walmart?
1444940	1449540	No, this is more like Goat Simulator, just ridiculous, stupid.
1449540	1453780	I'm thinking of Big Game Hunter, that's Deer Hunter Simulator.
1454140	1455140	Oops, big difference.
1455140	1457020	Yes, big difference.
1457020	1461140	The other game I played, which is also kind of a simulator game, is called the Coin Game,
1461140	1470680	and the Coin Game is basically a first-person arcade patron simulator game.
1470680	1477580	So you go and you play all of the ticket spitter games that you possibly could want to play.
1477580	1479980	They have all of your favorites there, and then...
1479980	1481680	Wait, this is Ticket Spitter Simulator.
1481680	1483420	It's a Ticket Spitter Simulator.
1483420	1489300	So you actually, so what they have right now is basically, it's just, they call it
1489300	1490660	Birthday Mode.
1490660	1492140	You start off with $50.
1492140	1497260	It's really unlimited money, and then you earn money, or tickets, and you get prizes
1497260	1498260	and stuff like that.
1498260	1501140	But they're going to have a survival mode that they're building in right now that basically
1501140	1505580	the way that works is you go, you're your kid, so you have certain hours that you can
1505580	1509140	be in the arcade and stuff, because you have your curfew and stuff.
1509140	1515820	So you go, you make, you win stuff with these tickets, you get prizes, you take them to
1515820	1522600	a pawn shop, and you pawn them off, and you get money, and it just, it's like, yeah.
1522600	1526060	And then you have your own house and everything, so you can actually get the prize.
1526060	1530220	This is kind of part of the game too, right now, is you can actually, any prizes you can
1530220	1534020	go to your house, you can go put them on your walls and stuff like that, and it's just,
1534020	1535620	it's ridiculous.
1535620	1539940	I feel like I want to play a ticket spitter simulator game that's mixed with Five Nights
1539940	1545420	at Freddy's, and so the premise is tickets or death.
1545420	1547420	Tickets or death?
1547420	1548780	Yes.
1548780	1552460	Would you play, Dark Sakura, would you play tickets or death?
1552460	1555620	I'll have the chicken.
1555620	1561940	Well it is, it is a game that they made in Unity, so I guess you could, you know, potentially
1561940	1565980	there, but like, I have to say, like, the physics of the games are pretty spot on, if
1565980	1570620	not a little bit more forgiving, like, I know the claw games, definitely more forgiving,
1570620	1575460	but it still has that limp claw physics and everything, and they've got, you know, just
1575460	1578740	like all the, but on top of that though, like, and I haven't really gotten to play through
1578740	1583820	much of it, but they have multiple arcades you can go to, including the Midway, and not
1583820	1590460	only do they have ticket games there, but they have go-karts, they have laser tag, and
1590460	1594580	they've got, like, other, like, Oh, this is why you downloaded it.
1594580	1597020	It's the virtual laser tag part of ticket or die.
1597020	1602980	It just, it looks, it looked really fun, just to mess around with, so yeah, the coin game
1602980	1610340	is fun messing around with that, but, yeah, so that's what I played this week.
1610340	1613860	For my gaming week, I was traveling out of town a few days for work this week, so that
1613860	1617980	kind of cut into my gaming time, although I did bring my Switch, so at the hotel I was
1617980	1621660	able to play a little bit of Pokémon Shield and work on my Pokédex a little bit, and
1621660	1626060	I was playing some of the classic Super Nintendo archive stuff, so playing some Super Metroid
1626060	1630820	and some A Link to the Past, just a little bit, and a little more Sayonara Wild Hearts
1630820	1635060	too, just because I was randomly thinking about that game, and I was like, I shall play
1635060	1637180	this game.
1637180	1642500	When I was at home, still continuing on Final Fantasy XIV, my friends made me, because I
1642500	1647420	was really resistant for a long time to do the new 24-man raid, the copied factory, which
1647420	1653180	is the one that's inspired by Nier, so I really kind of just didn't want to do it,
1653180	1659540	because sometimes those new raids, they're just a mess, and you wipe a bunch, and it's
1659540	1664180	like, so much time to get through, but it didn't end up being that bad, I guess.
1664180	1668660	It was fine, but I was also kind of like, okay, we got through it.
1668660	1673420	The music was really good, and it was a really pretty kind of raid, but then I was also kind
1673420	1680300	of like, okay, you guys were hyping that up a lot, and the music was really good, though,
1680300	1681300	I will say that.
1681300	1684620	The music was really great, especially in that last fight that you do in the copied
1684620	1689060	factory, so I did finally go through that, and I've just been working on random stuff
1689060	1694940	in Final Fantasy XIV, so yay for MMOs, and yay for continued adventures in No Man's Sky.
1694940	1697420	I've still been playing that.
1697420	1702340	I've probably played more No Man's Sky this time around than any other time I've revisited
1702340	1706060	the game, because you know every nine months or so I end up, ooh, what's new in No Man's
1706060	1707060	Sky?
1707060	1708060	Let's go visit it.
1708060	1712220	I was visiting my Steam library, and I noticed I did not have No Man's Sky installed on my
1712220	1717220	computer, so I did that, but I've yet to go back and actually play it.
1717220	1718220	All right.
1718220	1724300	Okay, well, if that's it for our gaming weeks, then we will move on and get into some more
1724300	1726220	stories for tonight.
1726220	1729000	Just housekeeping, we're in February now, right?
1729000	1734760	So there's not going to be a live show, actually it would be March 1st, but I'm hoping we can
1734760	1738080	tape something in a bit, because I'm going to be gone March 1st and March 8th.
1738080	1742200	I've mentioned this on the show before, but I'm going off with the Starboard Power Coupling
1742200	1744280	Kids onto the Star Trek Cruise.
1744280	1745400	I'm very excited about it.
1745400	1749600	I actually think one of those days I had a sistery thing to do anyway, so.
1749600	1752040	Okay, well, then I guess that works out, so yeah.
1752040	1756800	So March 1st and March 8th, no live shows, although Bobby Black Wolf will be here, and
1756800	1762040	I'm hoping we will have at least for one of those weeks something ready to go, because
1762040	1765280	you know I hate going two weeks, I hate going one week missing a show, but I really hate
1765280	1766280	going two weeks, so.
1766280	1770200	Well, I'm also going to say that I'm going to be doing a gaming-related thing in April.
1770200	1774240	I mean, it's not going to affect the show, but I'd like, I will be talking about it,
1774240	1780480	is that our local leather bar, The Bolt, has gamer night every third Friday.
1780480	1784000	I've been, I went to one of the first ones, and I got to be on it.
1784040	1788400	I hope maybe they've learned, because when I went, all it was was that on the TVs they
1788400	1793560	were playing Smash Brothers, and I was kind of like, this is, hopefully they've added
1793560	1794560	on it.
1794560	1795560	April's is going to be classic games.
1795560	1796560	Oh, fun.
1796560	1801560	So I will be there in face as a sister, but I will gladly also report on it for the show.
1801560	1802560	I want to go!
1802560	1804720	Yeah, go, well, it's also my friend's birthday.
1804720	1805720	I have to mention-
1805720	1807720	You want to go to the leather daddy bar with us?
1807720	1808720	Not really.
1808720	1812680	Well, not that I could, hey, I'm sure that'd be fun, but I just, I don't think I get the
1812680	1813680	time.
1813680	1814680	I get it.
1814680	1815680	Yeah.
1815680	1819320	Um, so I wanted to mention, and I don't remember if I mentioned this last week or before, but
1819320	1822720	like there's this 80s cafe that's over-
1822720	1823720	Oh, the one in Rancho.
1823720	1824720	Yeah.
1824720	1825720	Yeah, yeah, I know that place.
1825720	1829240	So they've got like, um, arcade games in there as well, and plus you can pay like a buck
1829240	1831440	and they have like console games set up and everything.
1831440	1832440	Oh, I did not.
1832440	1836840	And they have, uh, the servers are dressed up as well in costume, so they have one guy
1836840	1841260	that's dressed up like Ernest P. Worrell, and, uh, who's the other guy?
1841260	1842760	Is that the guy from the Ernst films?
1842760	1843760	Yes.
1843760	1844760	Oh my God.
1844760	1845760	Hey, Vern.
1845760	1846760	Yeah, exactly.
1846760	1847760	So-
1847760	1848760	Yeah, he died.
1848760	1849760	I-
1849760	1850760	That's great.
1850760	1851760	Yeah.
1851760	1859800	Um, Azette is saying that I got a Pokestop added there.
1859800	1864080	So if you, if you have spun the Pokestop at the 80s cafe, thank Azette.
1864080	1869200	But yeah, it's definitely worth checking out because the, their food looks pretty good
1869200	1870200	too.
1870200	1871200	They have a Cap'n Crunch milkshake.
1871200	1872200	I should have.
1872200	1873200	Damn it.
1873200	1875040	That's where I was going to go for Sunday for dinner.
1875040	1878680	I was like thinking, I'm like, there's a place I was going to go to stop.
1878680	1879680	I'm like, where was it?
1879680	1880680	I can't think of it.
1880680	1882600	So I ended up getting a sandwich thing.
1882600	1883600	Damn it.
1883600	1884600	Damn it.
1884600	1885600	Damn it.
1885600	1886600	Damn it.
1886600	1887600	All right.
1887600	1888600	As it says Tetris Tots.
1888600	1889600	Right.
1889600	1890600	Well, okay.
1890600	1891600	Oh, it's Tetris Tots.
1891600	1892600	All right.
1892600	1894700	I will, we will, uh, go, go forth into the community, uh, while we have a couple of weeks
1894700	1897080	of no live show and bring back some reports.
1897080	1901160	But I know I actually don't own anything leather except for a belt and some shoes.
1901160	1906600	I need, I, I, I don't either, but Alan does, and we're not going to talk about that on
1906600	1908040	my live internet podcast.
1908040	1914480	Well, I'm, I'm just saying that I would feel that maybe I'll have to like do like at least
1914480	1919640	like my wimple or something, you know, but at any rate, um, you know, it's also though
1919640	1921880	my friend's birthday and two days before my birthday.
1921880	1922880	So, okay.
1922880	1923880	That'd be fun.
1923880	1924880	Yeah.
1924880	1925880	All right.
1925880	1926880	Sounds good.
1926880	1927880	All right.
1927880	1930560	Um, I guess we can move on then.
1930560	1933920	Let's talk about, let's get into some gaming news and, uh, some of the stories from the
1933920	1934920	week.
1934920	1935920	So, uh, Loki, I think we'll start with you.
1935920	1936920	Yes.
1936920	1943400	But speaking of pokey stops, sort of speaking of leather daddies, um, uh, Pokemon home is
1943400	1949000	a brand new service that they're going to try to, um, milk some more money out of you.
1949000	1952800	Uh, because Hey, you know how you're paying for Nintendo online.
1952800	1954960	That's not online enough for Pokemon.
1954960	1960040	We need some more money because storing those Pokemon is hard.
1960040	1966880	And so, um, they have, they will have a basic service, which is free, or you can get the
1966880	1973480	premium service, which is $3 a month or $16 a year.
1973480	1979120	And uh, so basically the way it goes, um, this is going to be kind of replacing the
1979120	1981400	old Pokemon bank.
1981400	1986720	If you get the basic service, um, you can, I guess deposit three 30 Pokemon.
1987080	1994280	Uh, you can place three of them in the wonder box at one time, which I don't know how that
1994280	1995280	works.
1995280	1997520	I don't know if that's like you put something in and hope you get something good out of
1997520	1998520	that.
1998520	2006440	Um, and then of course they have, um, one Pokemon that you could put in the GTS at once.
2006440	2012880	They in order to trade, um, you can participate in room trades and then they have the judge
2012880	2016040	functions unavailable platinum.
2016040	2021200	It jumps up quite a bit so you can move Pokemon from the Pokemon bank.
2021200	2030240	Um, with that you can get up store up to 6,000 Pokemon, 30 and 6,000 seems quite the jump.
2030240	2034800	Um, you can put 10 Pokemon in the wonder box at once.
2034800	2037480	Three Pokemon can place in GTS.
2037480	2040000	Um, you can participate and host room trades.
2040000	2042360	You want to go to the wonder box, little Pikachu?
2042360	2044400	You want to go to the wonder box?
2044400	2045400	What's the wonder box?
2045760	2046760	I don't know.
2046760	2050640	The wonder box sounds like you get to drink from the fire hose.
2050640	2051640	Yes.
2051640	2054640	That's what it sounds like.
2054640	2056640	Uh, yes.
2056640	2063400	Um, I don't know, but I do know like there were, they had a, and it's not in this article,
2063400	2065760	but they have like a diagram talking about how.
2065760	2066760	Thank you.
2066760	2067760	Fifth dream.
2067760	2068760	Wonder box equals trading.
2068760	2071760	They, I knew some, if is Shane not here tonight, he must actually be watching the super bowl
2071760	2072760	or something.
2072760	2073760	Fifth dream's helping us out.
2073760	2074760	Wonder box equals trading.
2075120	2081320	Um, so they have like a diagram because apparently the way you can move Pokemon through this,
2081320	2084480	and I think this works with Pokemon go as well, is they can only go in certain directions.
2084480	2090320	So like for example, with, there's a fucking diagram about like how this, the, the square
2090320	2093760	peg can go in this square hole, but not this round hole.
2093760	2097760	And Pikachu from here can go there, but Pikachu, once he's there, can't go back.
2097760	2100560	So you better make sure like it's, it's fucking complicated.
2100560	2101560	Yes.
2101560	2102560	Yeah.
2102560	2107880	On one hand, I kind of get it and I give him a pass because you know, we're talking about
2107880	2113120	Pokemon the day, all the way back to the game boy from 1990 and technologies have changed
2113120	2114120	quite a bit.
2114120	2117560	And then you have the complication of you have that old, old game, but then we had the
2117560	2122360	virtual console versions of those games that would allow you to put things into the Pokemon
2122360	2123360	bank.
2123360	2129360	But now I don't know how home changes that is Pokemon home going to be on three D S because
2129840	2134640	home is probably not going to be a three D S and Pokemon home is replacing Pokemon bank.
2134640	2139120	And only if you get premium, can you move this Pokemon from Pokemon bank to Pokemon
2139120	2140120	home?
2140120	2145800	Well, all right then I can tell you that that sounds like a whole bunch of bullshit that
2145800	2147160	I don't want to mess with.
2147160	2152120	Well, I mean they were, I mean it's cloud storage or whatever, but it's not a lot like
2152120	2157640	it. I'm not how much storage really is it's going to cost. I'm not going to defend the
2157640	2162880	high price tag, but I'm going to be like, if they want to charge a couple bucks, then
2162880	2169200	fine. You know, it is an ongoing service and servers aren't free, but it's a little high
2169200	2170780	for what you're really getting.
2170780	2176680	I want to say that like, this is about three times as expensive as Pokemon bank was. I
2176680	2183560	don't remember, but I know this is several times more expensive than it was before with
2183560	2185920	not as many features I would imagine.
2185920	2190920	All right. Well, I don't know. I'll probably still check it out. Oh, sorry. Yes. I'm being
2190920	2191920	corrected by chat.
2191920	2192920	1996, not 1998.
2192920	2199320	Yeah, but I had said the Game Boy dates back to 1990, which it does, but you guys are right.
2199320	2205160	Pokemon was like, Pokemon was a very late Game Boy game. It was right on the cusp of
2205160	2210560	the Game Boy color because I remember Pokemon yellow was like a Game Boy color game basically.
2210560	2214000	Cause I had a Game Boy color that was a little Pikachu. And when you turned it on, you remember
2214000	2218180	how the power light was red? It was one of Pikachu's cheeks. It was really cute. Anyway,
2218180	2222760	that's how, that's how Pokemon gets away with it low key. Cause it's cute because you all
2222760	2223760	suckers.
2223760	2230040	All right. Uh, speaking of being suckers, uh, I'm a sucker for Pokemon go. I know that
2230040	2234800	game is a whole lot of fun and Pokemon go road rolled out some big new features this
2234800	2240380	week, including the go battle league, which means you can, uh, actually start to fight
2240380	2244360	other trainers and not just like three star friends or more on your list. You can actually
2244360	2250460	fight randos, uh, and you get some rewards for, uh, winning certain battles and you have
2250460	2255560	a rank that you can slowly increase and so forth. So, uh, we're in preseason leagues
2255560	2259040	right now and the great league battles are going on right now. I've been playing it a
2259040	2266120	little bit. Have you? Um, I did too. I must confess, I hate this feature. I, I hate it.
2266120	2271440	I don't, but I'm not a big fan of PVP in the Pokemon games. That's never really been it
2271440	2276920	for me. Uh, and let's be real. The battle in Pokemon go is not what it is in the mainline
2276920	2283280	Pokemon games. It's very different. Um, and I like it. I'm just from, from that, I like
2283280	2289480	the raids. I like the PVE. This is another case of I'm totally fine with PVE, but I'm
2289480	2294700	feeling forced into PVP that I don't want to do. Why am I feeling forced? Because there's
2294700	2301680	rewards and they're gated behind wins. And some of those rewards happen to be other Pokemon
2301680	2307020	that are new into the game. So you can only get them right now anyway, through winning
2307020	2312580	battles in this league. And I hate it to be honest. It's just, they're not that fun
2312580	2317660	to me. Um, the raids are completely different because you can turn that into a social thing.
2317660	2322180	I like meeting my ingress friends at the park and taking on a three or four star raid, whatever's
2322180	2327020	there, maybe a five star, depending on what it is, that is fine. Uh, being forced or feeling
2327020	2332060	like I'm forced to do PVP to unlock certain Pokemon is not fine. And son of a bitch, I'm
2332060	2337140	just realizing I never did spin a stop for that fucking quest day that was today. So
2337140	2341940	I was busy doing other stuff this afternoon. It's another new Pokemon that was only out
2341940	2346300	between like two and five o'clock today, the day of the super bowl, they decided to do,
2346300	2352300	um, this brilliant. Yeah, I know. Right. I'm hearing that that Pokemon will be an eggs.
2352300	2356300	So it's not that it's gone forever, but it's just one of those. Let me just irritating.
2356300	2361020	But, um, well, at the very least I got my shiny Magikarp today so I can finally have
2361020	2367240	a red Gyarados. Hmm. Uh, I'm curious too about the, uh, Pokemon community day vote. Cause
2367240	2370540	that was something that was going on yesterday. There's so much shit that goes on in Pokemon
2370540	2375820	go now, which is fine. I mean, I do applaud. And even though I hate this battle system,
2375820	2380260	um, I do applaud that at least it's a pretty major thing that they've added to the game.
2380260	2383820	So at least Niantic and the developers are continuing to enhance the game and that part's
2383820	2388220	kind of cool, but, uh, I just like it cause I've steamrolled over everybody. I guess I
2388220	2394780	did, I won a battle and then I lost too. So I was like, whatever. Uh, SG100 Matt says,
2394780	2398640	I'm doing the battling for the rewards. I'm kind of with Rob on this. The PVP doesn't
2398640	2403580	enhance the game for me, especially in its current battle form. And as that says what
2403580	2408820	I did it and Rob didn't delete the quest. Uh, if you got an extra one of those things,
2408820	2414660	trade me please. Cause I didn't get one. I'm sure. I'm sure other people I know went and
2414660	2421380	got like 18 shinies of whatever it was. What was the Pokemon they gave out today? I don't
2421380	2425380	remember some mousy Pokemon that I didn't end up getting. I was trying to show my 37
2425380	2430540	Magikarp. Are you near a nest or something? Or did you just unlock so many of them out
2430540	2436180	here? Like everywhere I go, Magikarp. It's um, because it ties into the Valentine's event,
2436180	2440900	which is almost over. I think I finally got my shiny, so I'm happy, but whatever. I'm
2440900	2445260	sorry. I take that back. It's not the Valentine's event. It's the year of the re it's the lunar
2445260	2450940	new year event. So is it also then the year of the unnecessary stupid fish? Well, you
2450940	2456700	know how like red is good luck. So what they're doing is they up the spawns of red or red
2456700	2463060	adjacent Pokemon. Now, even though Magikarp is orange, shiny Magikarp turns into red Gyarados.
2463060	2468180	So that's why you're seeing more Magikarp is because of the red Gyarados stretch, but
2468180	2471980	okay, it's a little bit of a stretch, but whatever. I mean, it's better than a ton of
2471980	2475700	those love discs because what the hell am I going to do with those? I like the events
2475700	2480980	that shake up the meta of the usual spawns, so I'm not going to complain about all the
2480980	2486180	Magikarp. The other one I'm seeing a ton of, um, the new, the crab things, the crab, the
2486180	2491580	core fish, uh, the food Gus, one of the new ones. Yeah. Which I like that fungus turns
2491580	2496180	into among us. Yeah. Cause there's a fungus among us. Thank you. SSU and Hunter Matt mini
2496180	2501380	Shino was the special Pokemon today. Thank you. So that's, that's the one that I didn't
2501380	2506900	bother to get, but just at some point I'll go visit Shane and I know he has like 20 shinies
2506900	2511380	already. I'm sure. And I would think if they were going to do pretty stuff, I would have
2511380	2517180	like your special quest one to be a melodic or something. Cause they're so pretty. Oh,
2517180	2522280	well, uh, there's going to be plenty more, uh, plenty more events coming to Pokemon go
2522280	2526160	in the future as well. I know they're setting up a legendary pretty soon. What's also interesting
2526160	2531240	about the battle thing is that you can either just pay coins to unlock more battles, right?
2531240	2537040	Money, money, money. But the other interesting way to unlock is walking five kilometers.
2537040	2542400	So if you walk five kilometers, you can also, which isn't that hard to do, especially if
2542400	2545960	you know, you're following the good guidelines of getting out, walking every day. Uh, and
2545960	2551340	you have an adventure sync enabled device, which pretty much any Apple phone at this
2551340	2555760	point has that it's now in Harry Potter and even, yeah. And now Harry Potter woo has it
2555760	2561040	too. And I've been making use out of that in that game for sure as well. So, um, yeah,
2561040	2565800	that's great. So anyhow, uh, at least, you know, even if this feature is not my cup of
2565800	2572000	tea, I am also very happy to hear that they're still developing a lot of shit for Pokemon
2572000	2576680	go. So that's pretty cool. Uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, I also didn't do the event.
2576680	2580160	My girlfriend traded me a bunch of hers. Well, that was, that was very nice of your girlfriend
2580160	2586240	to do. All right, well, let's move on. Dark Sakura, less Pokemon, more, uh, horror movies.
2586240	2592720	I also just realized I had like 18 ratatas. Time to send them to the blender. Uh, the
2592720	2598280	professor can deal with all this vermin. Anyway. Um, okay. So I have made no secret that I
2598280	2603600	love the silent Hill movie. I love Christoph Ganz for doing it. I even liked the crappy
2603600	2609120	sequel. It wasn't great, but it was silent Hill three. And that made me happy at any
2609120	2615120	rate. Um, there is a quote now from Christoph Ganz, um, where he was talking about his current
2615120	2621520	projects, um, during a, uh, interview with a French film site called Allocin. And I'm
2621520	2627360	just going to read the, um, the quote because it brings up more than one thing. I have two
2627360	2633000	horror film projects with Victor Hadida. I'm working on the adaptation of video game project
2633000	2638200	zero and which was fatal frame over here. Uh, the film will take place in Japan. I especially
2638200	2642080	don't want to uproot the game from its Japanese haunted house setting. And we're also working
2642080	2647400	on a new silent Hill. The project will always be anchored in this atmosphere of a small
2647400	2652760	American town ravaged by Puritanism. I think it's time to make a new one. One of the other
2652760	2657680	things that goes on to say is that his favorite silent Hill character though was James Sunderland,
2657680	2663780	who was the, uh, protagonist of silent Hill two. So maybe we'll get something actually
2663780	2667960	related to him. That would be kind of cool. Although I really did like the vibe of the
2667960	2672680	first one with following, um, you know, the themes of motherhood going on through it.
2672680	2679080	Um, I never noticed too in the first movie that all of the characters were women except
2679080	2684440	for Sean Bean in the, but he was like, he never went to silent Hill in the first move
2684440	2689020	in the male characters did. Yeah, exactly. So all of the characters that were in silent
2689020	2694240	Hill were women. I never noticed that until it was pointed out. I think that some of the
2694240	2698620	church people might've been, but all of the main characters, I'll have to double check
2698620	2707200	it. But, um, and the only other male characters that were within silent Hill were, uh, portrayed
2707200	2713560	as male, like the red pyramid and the janitor. I kind of red pyramid kind of struck me as
2713560	2718160	a genderless kind of thing though. I mean, maybe I'm just, I don't know. Well, not in
2718160	2723840	the games. Yeah, I guess that's true. But, but the, the fact that even those two were
2723840	2730200	played by, by men in that universe, and one of them was supposed to have been the janitor
2730200	2735380	that affected Alyssa or assaulted, I should've said. And then the other one was of course
2735380	2741680	the red pyramid. So another thing to throw in there. Uh, as that points out, the little
2741680	2747760	girl is in dark matter, which rocks. Oh, cool. So, yeah. So, uh, that's cool that we get
2747760	2751600	the, uh, silent Hill movie that that's going to continue on. And, uh, Chris, Chris off
2751600	2756140	guns doing that as good because you can do fatal frame weld as well. Yeah. I'd be curious
2756140	2759300	about a fatal frame. You know, the other thing that kind of strikes me as funky though about
2759300	2762560	this news. Um, you know, I mean, it's cool that we're getting, you know, more video game
2762560	2767960	movies of things we're into, but I'm really surprised with how freaking well the Witcher
2767960	2774200	did on Netflix. Now I know the Witcher was books, but let's be real game. The games help
2774200	2779000	there are three games. Yeah. So I'm kind of surprised we're not talking TV shows at
2779000	2783720	this point. Like I'm surprised we're not talking about what video games are Hulu looking at
2783720	2789640	and Amazon prime and the other, cause we also know that I'm the same company optioned final
2789640	2796680	fantasy 14 that made the Witcher. So we don't know what they're doing with it yet, but obviously
2796680	2801520	as a fan of 14, I'm really intrigued. Um, but I'm just surprised in general, we're not
2801520	2807280	talking about more video games becoming television series. Um, like there's fan wake every other
2807280	2812240	month about the legend is Zelda becoming a Netflix series of some sort. And I'm kind
2812240	2815800	of surprised we're not like, you know, with how well again, the Witcher is done. We're
2815800	2819440	not kind of talking about that or something like, can you imagine if the elder scrolls
2819440	2823120	became a TV series? I mean, the elder scrolls seems like something that's perfect for that
2823120	2829360	sort of thing, but maybe it's too much high fantasy. Maybe that would be too much. Like
2829440	2833520	if, uh, you could just cause the Witcher, it seems like the Witcher is doing very well.
2833520	2838320	Well, for two reasons, the Witcher is doing very well because number one, Henry Cavill
2838320	2845360	is nice to look at attractive in that show. Uh, and then number two, uh, the Witcher is
2845360	2850320	doing well because it's filling a void for many people left by game of Thrones, especially
2850320	2854880	the subpar last season of game of Thrones. I'm hearing that people are checking out the
2854880	2858480	Witcher because it's a lot of the same type of like high fantasy that, you know, the game
2858480	2862480	of Thrones delivered. So yeah, kind of interesting. There's another quote in here that I really
2862480	2866880	like, cause it's how I feel about the first movie, um, about back to silent Hill that
2866880	2871920	guns considers it to be a viewed, a beautiful memory. And he had a great sense of satisfaction
2871920	2878160	when it was released. Fifth dream today says Mandalorian mean means a mass effect show.
2878880	2883440	Can you imagine a mass effect TV show? I just, I don't want them to do it cause they wouldn't
2883440	2889040	get it right. I did. I did just finish the Mandalorian. That was a great TV show. That
2889040	2895600	was like a very well done step aside for just a second about the Mandalorian. I had a lot of
2895600	2900480	Firefly vibes for it, for it being the space Western and having some of that same little
2900480	2905200	quirkiness thrown in amongst the seriousness. I really had such a good feeling from that show.
2905200	2909040	I still haven't watched Mandalorian. I'm like, I'm so uncool girl. Wow. You know,
2909040	2912880	did you finish the good place? No, I sure haven't. I'm more like halfway through season three. No,
2912880	2917680	everybody is talking about how, like I w you know, most TV finales, people are like,
2917680	2922400	Meh, but I have not heard a single bad thing about the good place finale. No spoilers,
2922400	2928480	no spoilers, but everybody is saying it's perfect that it ended very well. And that there will like
2928480	2933920	never be another show like it pretty much, pretty much. Yeah. I'm so curious. So, all right.
2933920	2939360	Anyhow. All right. Well, until then let's move on. So one thing, uh, I know I will not be,
2939600	2942800	playing or watching the good place on is a brand new switch, right?
2943520	2945920	Well, you're probably not gonna be watching on the switch anyway. So I don't think they
2945920	2950560	really have a lot of Hulu. Oh yeah. And I guess Netflix a little bit, but, uh,
2950560	2956000	Netflix, uh, YouTube and Hulu, they do not have Netflix on the switch. No, that's a,
2956000	2961120	that's a sore spot right now. Yeah. Really? Yeah. I swear it. Maybe I'm thinking of the Wii U.
2961920	2965360	You know what? Random, but you know, it was really cool. And I got to give props to this,
2965600	2970720	cause I was at a hotel, I was at a Hyatt hotel, uh, for work this week. And, um, I brought my
2970720	2975840	switch dock and my switch to plug into the TV, which was really easy to do because they put
2975840	2979600	HDMI ports on the side of the TV. Now they realize that people want to plug in their own shits. They
2979600	2985200	do, but all these TVs they have in the hotel now have Chromecast built in. So I wanted to watch
2985200	2989680	Star Trek Picard because I hadn't seen that yet. Right? Well, all I had to do, I just went onto
2989680	2994080	the phone and paired it and then that, uh, my CBS all access, just cause there's, you know,
2994080	2998000	there's no app on the TV for CBS all access, but there isn't a phone. I was able to just play Star
2998000	3002880	Trek card on the TV and catch up on what I'd missed, which was awesome. Cool. Yeah. Anyway,
3002880	3007280	sorry for the random tangent, but I just, it was one of those, I love technology and I love when
3007280	3013600	the hotels like are actually current on technology. That was a really good feeling. So anyways, um,
3013600	3020400	apparently they said despite the rumors that there was going to be some sort of fancier pro version
3020400	3028320	of the switch coming out. Um, they have their latest financial report from Nintendo basically
3028320	3033760	said, please note, we have no plans to launch a new Nintendo switch model during 2020.
3035440	3040880	I'm really glad they gave this heads up. Honestly. I just think it's not coming in 2020,
3040880	3046240	but it'll be 2021. Oh no. Sure. Of course. Of course, Loki. But I'm glad that they kind of
3046240	3051760	put to bed the talks of, oh boy, now I'm going to have to buy a PlayStation five and a switch pro
3051760	3059280	this year. I think Nintendo was smart to maybe back off a little bit and instead do the, um,
3059280	3063680	you know, the, the, the switch in a year where they're not launching new consoles from, from
3063680	3069920	PlayStation and X-Box. So, um, good. Yeah. And it's, it's not like the current switch is bad
3069920	3074800	by any means. And some people really love that switch light. So they've got plenty right now.
3074880	3078320	So they're going to wait a little longer on the switch pro, and I think that's fine.
3078320	3081840	So, and now I don't have to worry about buying three new consoles this year.
3081840	3084720	And I wasn't really worried about it anyways, but like, I don't know,
3085280	3091520	can we fix the analog six on the controllers, please? Uh, fifth dream today says what? No
3091520	3096480	two screen switch. Damn. I don't, I don't know if the switch is going to go to screen. I just
3096480	3101200	don't really see that happening. I would, if they wanted to emulate DS or 3DS games,
3101200	3105600	all you would have to do is tilt the existing switch on its side and have a black line in the
3105600	3111920	middle. Like if they wanted to do 3DS or regular DS games, they could, uh, hello clubhouse games
3111920	3118320	returning on switch. Wouldn't that be nice? Um, pod culture believes the switch light is awesomer
3118320	3122400	and it just, it just depends on your preference. Like if you pretty much only play the switch in
3122400	3126000	undocked mode, then yeah, the switch light's probably going to be better for you. I prefer
3126000	3131360	to play in docked mode, but I also realize I'm, there's more people in the other camp than me.
3131360	3134880	That's how I play. Yeah, I know. I know. It's how a lot of people tell me they play,
3134880	3139360	but I prefer the dock mode. So, all right, well, let's move on. I was just talking about hotels
3139360	3144480	a minute ago. Funny enough. Uh, we have a story about, and I'm kind of, this is just not the
3144480	3149520	business I expected this company to get into, but I guess, um, wherever they can actually make a
3149520	3157360	dime, they'll do it. It's Atari. Atari is investing in the hotel business. And as much as I would want
3157360	3161200	to point and laugh, because ha ha Atari has not made a lot of great decisions in the last few
3161200	3167600	years. And let's be real that VCS is going to be a gigantic flop. Like, sorry, I'm sorry to sound so
3167600	3174240	rude. Uh, and like, I'm not even giving the thing a chance, but, um, why should I like, there's no
3174240	3178800	reason to give the Atari VCS a chance. It's, it's likely going to fly. Is anybody buying an Atari
3178800	3184960	VCS in chat? Anybody? So it's interesting to hear about Atari getting into other industries
3185600	3190240	based on their nostalgia. I was just talking to friends about this recently and the kind of the
3190240	3195840	question came up that was like, how is Atari even still around? Like, what has Atari really done?
3195840	3203200	And I'm like, Atari is still around on the strength of their catalog. It's like that one
3203200	3209920	hit wonder that wrote a song like 30 years ago that they still play on the radio. Like quick,
3209920	3217200	can you name the last Simple Minds album? Don't you forget about it. Exactly. You know what?
3218400	3223440	Simple Minds never has to write another hit because Don't You Forget About Me,
3223440	3227120	which actually was written for Billy Idol. I don't even think they wrote it. Um,
3228080	3233200	it, the money they make off that song, you probably retire off it. You know,
3233200	3237120	when you got a song that big, I'm trying to think of other like gigantic one hit wonders
3237120	3241040	that still get played on the radio to this day. Well, I mean, there's always take on me,
3241040	3248080	but Wham was really huge in Europe. You mean, you mean aha. Uh huh. It made it funnier. Don't worry.
3248640	3256800	Well, I mean, Wham did, did better things when it split up. Yeah, for sure. So anyway,
3257120	3264960	um, excuse me, uh, Pixel Pacas says, I don't want the VCS. I do want the Intellivision Amico though.
3264960	3269040	Well, but Intellivision, we all know is doing their own completely different thing. And,
3269040	3272560	and this ain't about that, but I do agree with you to that extent, Pixel Pacas.
3274800	3282080	That actually reminded me of one little thing. I did get a new Atari 7800 game. Oh, what's that?
3282080	3287520	I got a baby Pac-Man. I didn't even know they made that on the 7800. They didn't.
3288160	3293840	It's a, I think it was either a prototype that someone finished. Gotcha. But I'm just saying,
3293840	3299520	I have Atari stuff and I have a baby Pac-Man in my house that is not as good as the real thing,
3299520	3304320	but pretty good. Okay. Sorry. I got in a coughing fit there and Jamie brought that up to help me
3304320	3310000	out here. So let's go back to talking about Atari. So Atari is getting into the hotel industry since
3310000	3314080	Atari's strength and the point I was trying to make is that a lot of the money they are
3314080	3319360	still making is off their back catalog and the strength of, you know, Atari retro. And I love
3319360	3323280	Atari retro. I have that fricking Atari hoodie that I love so much that actually looks like the
3323280	3327120	wood paneling. Pretty much it's in every other selfie I've ever taken to myself because I love
3327120	3333200	that fucking hoodie. Anyhow, Atari is going to try to mix this nostalgia people love about them
3333200	3339600	and mix it with the hospitality entry industry. So the company has signed a contract that will
3339600	3346320	have the Atari licensed name and branding in line with a real estate developer who is building
3346320	3352560	eight hotels in the US. Phoenix will be the home of the first Atari hotel, but there will also be
3352560	3360560	hotels in Austin, Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas. Does that mean an Atari casino too? Interesting.
3360560	3366800	That would be rad. That would be rad actually. San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle. So there'll
3366800	3372160	be some not far from here because San Francisco and San Jose aren't far. Nifty 805 though is like
3372160	3377120	how I feel about it. I don't want an Atari themed hotel. I need a gamer X. How about a gamer X at
3377120	3383840	the Atari hotel? Okay, I can deal with that. Okay. See, porque no los dos. Anyway, um, now we should
3383840	3389440	have a uh, a Chuck E Cheese hotel since, you know, we're throwing nostalgia stuff. Everyone can have
3389440	3396400	a hotel now. Now what's the Coleco doing nowadays? You get a hotel and you get a hotel. Here's what
3396400	3402080	might surprise you about. So it's not just a hotel with the Atari logo on it. They are trying
3402080	3407440	to theme these a little bit. So what are they going to do with the Atari hotels? Esports studios.
3407440	3413280	We don't know any more than just that, that there will be Esports studios, but I mean, okay, you go
3413280	3420000	to any hotel. They have ballrooms, meeting room, conference rooms. So branding one of these rooms
3420000	3426320	as an Esports studio. Okay. It makes sense, right? I'm kind of into it. I'm very curious.
3427360	3433600	There will also be an Atari gaming playground at every Atari hotel. The playgrounds, we don't know
3433600	3437520	again what that is besides the name, but speculation is that it could be like lounges for
3437520	3443360	guests. Maybe it'll have some gaming PCs in there. And then of course, pool, gym, restaurants, bars,
3443360	3450000	bakeries, movie theaters in every building as well. So kind of interesting. Atari is simply
3450000	3454960	licensed. They will not have any direct hand in the design of the hotels or what the hotels will
3454960	3464560	feature. Probably a good thing considering the VCS. Atari will receive 5% of the hotel revenues.
3464560	3471520	They got an advance of $600,000 for licensing the brand to the developer. That is pretty rad.
3471520	3477600	So I have to admit, I'm intrigued because it doesn't just sound like a different direction
3477600	3485600	for Atari. It sounds like a hotel that's being built with a very specific generation in mind,
3485600	3491840	namely the generation we're pretty much all in. That kind of the blurred line of Gen X and
3491840	3497600	millennials, right? I've heard it called Zillennials, right? That blended term? Zennials.
3497600	3500720	Zennials. Thank you. I've heard it called, and I love this name. Have you ever heard it called
3500720	3504960	the Oregon Trail Generation? Because I've heard it called that, and I think that's perfect.
3504960	3511680	So the gap between Gen X and millennials is the Oregon Trail Generation. Perfect. So it sounds
3511680	3517520	like these hotels are kind of like a new thought of how to make a hotel appealing to a different
3517520	3523680	crowd. And honestly, with the minute you guys said an Atari themed casino, potentially, assuming
3523680	3528480	they're building one in Vegas, that sounds kind of awesome. I'd visit, wouldn't you guys?
3529360	3534960	Yeah. Especially, well, especially if they do have, don't sound too excited, especially if they
3534960	3541520	have the classic gaming stuff. When I go up to Reno, I like to go to Pepper Mill because they
3541520	3544640	have the- That's always where Dan stays when work takes him to Reno.
3544640	3547120	Right? Because they have the classic games in the arcade.
3547120	3550800	And all that pinball. Yeah. It's gotten a little weaker over the years,
3550800	3554880	but it's still the strongest thing they have in Reno as far as classics go. So imagine if
3554880	3558800	Atari were to milk that with these classic game spaces, like classic game arcades,
3558800	3562960	fuck yeah. I'd totally be into that. And that's something that all ages can really enjoy.
3562960	3567760	So, oh, I think it's cool. Arcade games in all the rooms.
3567760	3572320	Yeah. Well, maybe. An Atari VCS in every room. Yay.
3575280	3582640	Okay. Let's see. Sia Tabiri says, my new term learned this week. We are boomers.
3585360	3591760	People who insist anime was best before 2000. That doesn't necessarily make sense.
3592960	3595040	Are you a weaboomer, Dark Sakura?
3597760	3602000	Personally, my favorite anime came out before I was born. So I mean,
3602000	3606080	I'm not the right one to talk about that. I mean, keep in mind, my favorite-
3606080	3609840	Okay, weaboomer. My favorite anime is Science Ninja
3609840	3612800	Team Gatchaman. And you want to know who's responsible for that, right?
3613680	3614800	Yoshitaka Amano.
3616240	3620000	All right. Well, at least I think you're not alone in loving your Gatchaman.
3621840	3628640	And DJ Rama S in chat says 1996 to 2010, when anime was the best. Okay, weaboomer. All right.
3628640	3632640	Come on, though. That was when we had, well, actually a little bit earlier than that,
3632640	3639040	we had Samurai Troopers, which was Ronin Warriors over here. We had Dragon Ball Z,
3639040	3643360	if you want to talk about the good stuff, that everyone got into. Ranma we had.
3644960	3650400	What else? There was also Cowboy Bebop. There was Evangelion. That was really kind of like
3650400	3653040	the golden age of modern anime. So I'm going to say-
3654800	3659440	Okay, estrogen100Matt about the Atari Hotel says, I'd check it out, but I would like to see it
3659440	3664560	built. Projects like this tend to fall apart before a shovel has hit the ground. Disney tried
3664560	3669920	this similar thing years ago, not a hotel, but game centers. Very, very good point. Let's not
3669920	3673760	get too ahead of ourselves until they actually put one up. Fall apart before it's even built.
3673760	3678160	That sounds just like the VCS. That sounds just like an Atari thing to happen. But remember,
3678160	3684320	Atari just licensed out their name, so we'll see what happens. All right. Anyhow, let's move on.
3684320	3687520	We're going to take a trip down memory lane. I know it's a little earlier in the show than
3687520	3690400	we usually do it, but Dark Sakura is going to have to leave a little early tonight.
3690400	3693760	Because my work schedule's garbage. So we're going to get to the classic
3693760	3698640	game of the week. And we're going to take a trip down memory lane and visit a simpler time
3698640	3703840	when there were not Atari themed hotels. In fact, you couldn't even bring your Atari to a hotel.
3703840	3707040	It was too complicated to hook up. But if you did bring it to a hotel and get it working,
3707040	3710720	I mean, props for you. I mean, I did used to sneak my nest to a hotel.
3712240	3716160	I brought a Super Nintendo, I think, once to a convention. But anyway,
3716160	3719360	it's the classic game of the week. And actually, I think what you picked is a little newer than
3719360	3723360	that stuff. Because again, you only have to be 10 years old to be a classic game of the week.
3723840	3726400	Tonight's pick is probably somewhere around, I guess, maybe 15?
3727200	3728400	2001.
3728400	3730480	Okay. Oh, okay. Wow. Almost 20?
3731040	3732000	Almost 20.
3732000	3733200	All right. Well, here it is. The classic-
3733200	3734480	It's still a surprising one.
3734480	3737120	Yeah. Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game of the week?
3737120	3743760	I picked Zone of the Enders, which I was trying to think of, like, what was some of the last
3743760	3748480	good stuff that Konami did, right? And Zone of the Enders was pretty fucking amazing,
3748480	3752960	I think. It was a really good game. I wasn't any good at it, but hey.
3754000	3757840	And the thing that I liked about it is I really did sort of like this mecha combat
3757840	3762480	style that was going on. I mean, I love- What was the game? Cyber Sled? I love Virtual On.
3762480	3766880	And this is right up there with it, but just a little bit newer of a vibe.
3767760	3777680	So anyway, it is set in space around Jupiter. And you play as a columnist named Leo Stenbuck.
3778480	3784720	Who is a survivor of a colony after it was attacked. And you control his mecha,
3784720	3789760	which is called an orbital frame called Jehudi. I always mispronounce it because, like I said,
3789760	3796720	I hardly played the game because I wasn't great at it. But it was supposed to be a more realistic
3796720	3803840	take on the mecha genre. The mecha was designed by Shinkawa Youji, who did the mecha design for
3803840	3807920	Metal Gear. So another reason I'm reading this up, it has a lot of ties with the Metal Gear series.
3809440	3817200	And it was, however, criticized for being a short game with poor localization. But the game in
3817200	3823760	general was still overly well received. It did come out on March 21st, 2001 in Japan.
3824400	3829760	And then in April in North America and Europe, and it came out on the PlayStation 2.
3831360	3836400	There also was quite another bit that was tied into it. We had a spin-off for Game Boy Advance
3836400	3843040	called The Fist of Mars. And then, that's right, that was Game Boy Advance. And the second runner,
3843040	3848480	which was a sequel for the PlayStation 2. There was, speaking of anime from before, Sunrise,
3848480	3857440	one of the, I'd say one of the greater animation studios, did two anime that were related to Zone
3857440	3862640	of the Enders. And then the game was re-released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 along with Zone of
3862640	3869280	the Enders, the second runner, in October 2018 as a Zone of the Enders HD collection.
3870560	3874240	Which, by the way, for those watching on Twitch right now, you're seeing footage from the HD
3874240	3879440	collection. The original did not look this good. Yeah, but it's the same game.
3879440	3887600	It's the same game. Yeah. So anyway, it is a third person hack and slash game where you are a child
3887680	3894720	that pilots a mecha and you basically go around to different parts of the space colony that orbits
3894720	3903040	Jupiter and attack these rogue mecha, other orbital frames. And you have to minimize damage
3903040	3909200	around you, use strategic combat. You have ranked, your battles are ranked to see based on how well
3909200	3918000	you do within your parameters. And then you can go different ways. It's a non-linear path that you
3918000	3927680	can take. And you also have to find this aura called Metatron Ore to repair your mecha. You've
3927680	3934400	got your usual type of mecha combat. You have lock-on targeting for things at a distance. You
3934400	3939520	have an energy sword and a projectile and other sub weapons. And your arsenal will grow the
3939520	3943760	further you want to make it through the game. And after you beat the game, you get a versus mode
3944320	3951040	where you can compete against an AI or another character. So frame versus frame.
3952000	3958640	The game was originally under development for the original PlayStation and the PC, but Konami
3959360	3963360	didn't really want to actually release them on that. They also had prototypes built for
3963360	3968080	the Dreamcast. They were really focusing on the anime style for the robots,
3969680	3975520	but adding more realism to it to compare with other sci-fi at the time. And then
3977200	3985200	they wanted to write it. Actually, the scenario writer, Okamura Noriyaki, wanted to do a serious
3985200	3990320	story that had complicated lives and it was supposed to examine the purpose and nature of
3990320	3998560	life. And so they wanted to avoid having multiple endings, although there were different side quests
3998560	4003200	that could have different endings. And so they also wanted to tell the story through gameplay
4003200	4009600	instead of cut scenes. So, I mean, the game really, I think, it delivered in the style.
4009600	4015040	It delivered in story. I mean, the localization, again, left some to be desired, but the action
4015040	4019200	was really good on it. And yeah, I'd be great with a complaint that it probably could have been
4019200	4024400	a longer game. But, I mean, just look how pretty it is. I mean, this is the HD one again, but even
4024400	4030560	when the original came out, it was pretty, pretty. Some comments from chat. SDG100Matt says,
4030560	4034720	I bought this to get the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo and being totally surprised about how awesome
4034720	4040480	Zone of the Enders was. And Hype Mayhem saying, I remember that a lot of folks bought Zoe,
4040480	4044240	if only because of the included Metal Gear Solid 2 demo. Well, I hadn't gotten to that yet. Thank
4044240	4050000	you, chat room. Sorry. So, okay. So yeah, it came with a demo. So there, that part's talked about.
4052480	4058720	But at any rate, it may, for Metacritic, it had an average score of 78 out of 100.
4060080	4065200	And they thought the biggest praise it got was because of the use of the cinematography in the
4065200	4075680	game with camera following the mecha. And GamePro actually preferred it to Armored Core 2 because
4075680	4081520	it was responsive and quick and that the design was highly detailed. But yeah, most of the people
4081520	4087440	were just like, it was too short. And they thought that the voice acting was emotionless.
4088640	4092960	And being really, some people reported just being really annoyed by the voice acting in it,
4092960	4101360	that there were people from whiny to dead. Which I mean, voice, early video game voice acting,
4101360	4105040	I think was a little bit hit or miss. But then again, we also had just gotten off of
4105600	4110560	having really amazing voice acting. Like, you know, again, we came out of Metal Gear,
4110560	4118400	for example, another, you know, relating back to that. But yes, it did have the Metal Gear Solid 2
4118400	4129760	Sons of Liberty demo, which probably drove most of the sales of this game. But it was, you know,
4129760	4136960	really, really just a fun little game. And like I said, we had sequels, we had other related series
4136960	4143120	and a full animation series that went right along with it. So there you go. Zone of the Enders is
4143120	4148160	our game. Not bad for a game most people bought just to check out the demo for another game. But
4148640	4153360	that happens sometimes. I seem to remember, what was it? The Final Fantasy 7 demo was with?
4155280	4163120	Oh, it was that fighting game. No, it was done by, no, that was the final, was it Final Fantasy?
4163120	4165840	Maybe I'm thinking Final Fantasy 8 was with Brave Fencer Musashi.
4165840	4168080	I remember getting Brave Fencer Musashi.
4168080	4171120	And, but there was another demo that came out.
4171120	4172960	Toeball number one. Thank you.
4172960	4173360	Yeah.
4173360	4176320	Okay. That's a series that should continue on.
4177040	4180400	Toeball number two was pretty fun too, but it only came out in Japan.
4181200	4185200	All right. Well, there it is. Zone of the Enders, the classic game of the week. And I think
4185200	4187040	Dara Sakura might be having a go. I don't know.
4187040	4188480	I could do my last story.
4188480	4189360	You want to do your last story?
4189360	4189920	No, why not?
4189920	4191440	Do you want to do it now?
4191440	4192400	Yeah, I'll do it now.
4192400	4194800	Okay. So let me skip ahead here. So go ahead and do your last story.
4194800	4199920	Sorry about that. Well, it's a really quick thing anyway. You know how in the other Animal
4199920	4205280	Crossings we could cheat with different memory cards and other systems and whatnot. You can
4205280	4214800	have one island per switch. Even if you have other game cartridges, save files, you have
4214800	4216400	one island per switch.
4217040	4220880	Oh, so if multiple people play on that switch, it'll be kind of like the GameCube one where
4221680	4224240	you could have like four people on your memory card type of thing.
4224240	4225520	Exactly. And that's it.
4226240	4228240	All right. I'm still looking forward to the game.
4228240	4232320	Oh, totally. Well, honestly, I'm kind of pleased for that because I'm tired of people,
4232320	4236720	you know, cheating and getting something in one place versus the other. So whatever.
4236720	4241440	It's okay. Nintendo's just saying, oh, you want some more islands? Well,
4241440	4244400	we've got some brand new things we'd like to show you.
4244400	4247280	Check it out in our new Tom Nook DLC corner.
4248400	4252400	Hey, we've got so many different switches. Did you try the switch light? It's pretty nice.
4252400	4257200	I want them to do an Animal Crossing switch light. I'm not going to spoil on other things
4257200	4261600	that might be talked about later on, but I really want a switch light so that I can have
4261600	4264640	something that doesn't have detachable parts to take in my bag.
4264640	4268480	Fair enough. All right. All right. Well, thank you, Dark Sakura. Have a great night.
4268480	4271600	Sorry about the work schedule and we'll see you next week.
4271600	4273120	You didn't give me the crap schedule.
4273120	4276240	I didn't do it. All right. We'll see you next week.
4276240	4279360	Meanwhile, let's move on over to Loki. What do you have for us?
4279360	4283600	This is pretty incredible. So you may know that flash is
4284720	4288480	there basically any support for flash December 31st of this year?
4288480	4290880	Yes. My Google Chrome browser tells me that.
4290880	4295520	I know all the time. I was like, dude, fuck off. When I check my calendar,
4295520	4298160	it's not December 31st. So you can fuck right off, you know.
4300080	4305520	So in the meantime, though, to prepare us for the world without flash
4306880	4314400	comes Flashpoint is basically archiving thousands of old classic flash games
4314960	4319920	that you may have enjoyed. And you can check this all out for free.
4320960	4324000	And the these are all downloadable and playable on your computer.
4324000	4327760	So includes, you know, stuff from, you know, many sites like Miniclip.
4329920	4335200	It is a very large. What the hell?
4336240	4340400	It's a very large car horn is not. It's not coming from your computer.
4340400	4344800	No, it's not my computer. It's a very large. Did the diners fucking win?
4345760	4349040	Because if they won, that's all we're going to hear all night horns.
4349120	4354000	Yeah. Riots and shit. Anyways, very large archive.
4354000	4356320	Oh, no. Tiger class says the Chiefs won. Thank God.
4358880	4366160	Sorry. Not sorry. Like if y'all could behave when your team wins a game, then I wouldn't care.
4366160	4369840	But people don't know how to fucking behave. So apparently we have a Chiefs fan across the street.
4369840	4375600	Wonderful. Anyways, so you can download the archive. They have several different
4376240	4379520	things like different sets of games that are in here.
4379520	4383520	The whole archive itself is like two hundred ninety gigabytes, which is quite large.
4384080	4388160	But you don't have to download everything. You can actually still because you could
4388160	4390880	most hard drives they sell now are like three terabytes.
4390880	4394960	All right, right, right. You could fit decades. I'm not I'm not saying that it's impossible to
4394960	4399360	store that much data on your system. I mean, it's very possible. I'm just thinking that's
4399360	4402720	a good third of your bandwidth cap right there. You know, if you think about it.
4403280	4411840	Um, so, yes, if if for whatever reason, you know, of these 36000 games that are included in here,
4411840	4416000	your favorite game is not among them. You can actually suggest that they archive
4416000	4422480	other games as well and they will go ahead and do that. But yeah, it is very large.
4422480	4425920	They have a master game list that's in here and everything.
4425920	4435360	Popcap. Yeah, it's just I don't even know what half of these what is half of this of like
4435360	4440800	pencil kids dot com. It's it's very clearly a bunch of sites you probably never checked out ever.
4440800	4447840	Do they have a wasn't a don't shit your pants a flash game? I don't know. It may have been.
4447840	4452960	I know that one of my they had they had a trailer, though, that was like showing off some of the
4452960	4456560	games that were in there, like some of the stick fight games they had. I think
4457360	4465520	one of the original versions of Superhot was a flash game. But yeah, lots of really classic
4465520	4471200	stuff. I knew I knew someone would ask. So I have to answer this. Pod culture and chat says
4471200	4479120	flappy vog flappy vog, you know, is available at vog network dot com. Mr. Black Wolf built that in
4479120	4484160	unity. So I do not believe it uses flash. I don't know. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. It's like
4484160	4488720	oh, yeah, it's HTML five. So you'll be happy to be part of the arc. You'll be happy to know that
4488720	4496480	don't shit your pants is part of the archive. One of my all time favorite flash games. Yes.
4497520	4502880	It's the reason why I love that game so much is this it's the sound it makes when you
4503360	4510320	are just just the whole ending sequence of the game when you do, in fact,
4510320	4514640	shit your pants. It's that little like instead of a sad trombone, it makes us a little like
4520400	4525200	but yes, there's too many games for me to even go into, but definitely go check it out. We're
4525280	4533680	going to read the name of all 30 games right now. Starting with it's going to be a whole lot of
4534800	4539840	monkey go happy games because they have a ton of them. Fifth dream today and chat says they're
4539840	4549200	also archiving flash animations. So oh my God, we forever. Oh, good. Does that weren't strong,
4549200	4554160	bad emails and flash? Yes. Then I hope to God somebody is preserving those.
4554240	4557920	I would think that. Hey, you're back. A lot of people have been going back and redoing
4557920	4565120	things in HTML 5. Oh, good. Important update. Thank you. All right. Let's see. Other comments
4565120	4571120	in chat. Let's see. There are unique in the games, though. They're part of this.
4571760	4579200	So maybe some of the older Unity games. They have like some Terry Cavanaugh games.
4579200	4586960	I don't know. Oh, yeah. Would the original suit like hexagon super hexagon be a flash game?
4586960	4592240	I don't know. This seems to be organized in a sort of manner. So they've got like it's snow
4592240	4598320	drift, red sky radio silence are the three games in this list for Terry Cavanaugh, CB2. I guess
4598320	4604320	he's a lot of this old stuff. Well, and let's be real. Probably the flash game you are most
4604320	4609680	concerned about is Frog Fractions. Like, I mean, as much as I hype up other flash games,
4610400	4615200	Frog Fractions really probably is the all time greatest flash game. So you might wonder like
4615200	4621440	what what happens to Frog Fractions when Google Chrome and the other browsers no longer run flash?
4621440	4628240	Well, the good news is Frog Fractions, the game of the decade edition will has appeared on steam.
4628720	4635920	It will have a mid to late 2020 release. So no idea when that will actually happen. And
4635920	4642800	maybe you forgot what Frog Fractions is. Great. Even better. Even better. Just just play. Go in
4642800	4647680	blind. I saw him play the second one yet. Yeah. Apparently the second one is like one of those.
4647680	4652800	The sequel never as funny as the original. But I'm here like people are like, it was OK,
4653360	4660400	but it just like it in the second one, you kind of you know, to expect the randomness
4660400	4665520	of what Frog Fractions is in the first game, you weren't expecting you were expecting just
4665520	4669680	to do fractions. Well, I mean, you kind of think, OK, this is going to take a disturbing turn.
4669680	4674240	And then like, what the fuck? Like, you know, the first game has a lot of those moments
4674240	4678480	where it's like, what the fuck? And like, you know, it's kind of like, oh, you expect those
4678480	4684080	in the second game. So I should make my kids play that game. You should be. That would be funny.
4684080	4689920	The film anyway. So that's very good to hear that Frog Fractions will be making a return on steam.
4689920	4694720	And honestly, I'll probably buy it because I'm a consumer whore. I am a whore for Frog Fractions.
4694720	4699040	Ain't that the truth? Hell, yes. The Flash game for Fast Five is part of this as well.
4699040	4702960	Is it really in The Simpsons? All those terrible movie tie in games
4703840	4709280	are probably part of it. Drunken wrestlers. This is this is a Twitch stream in the making,
4709280	4712880	going through and playing some of the old Flash games. Candy Mountain Massacre Revenge.
4712880	4718320	Wait, is that based on the YouTube Candy Mountain? Charlie, you gotta go to Candy Mountain. No,
4718320	4722000	they have the finale, though. They're starting to put the finale out. Have you watched any of that
4722000	4727040	yet? I, I did not even know in the year of Our Lord 2020 that Candy Mountain was still a fucking
4727040	4733120	thing. Yes, it is. They had a Kickstarter a long time ago and they finally just started
4733120	4738080	to put out the finale and the first episode was super long. It had nothing. It has anyone
4738080	4743840	out there watched beyond the first one that, you know, I've watched all of them and I've watched
4744400	4753200	Charlie Tech Unicron, which is hilarious. OK, I am a big fan. Do you make the kids watch it?
4753200	4758240	I did make the kids watch it. Did they like it? I did not make them watch all of the llamas
4758240	4763520	with hats. Some of it because it started to get a little violent, but they thought it was funny.
4763520	4769440	Right. Let's move on. We're going to travel around and check out some quick news from around the
4769440	4776560	globe. All right. So let's talk a little bit about what we're going to be getting for. Well,
4776560	4783120	not exactly free, free, free and free with our mandatory subscriptions. Subscriptions are
4783120	4789280	mandatory. Please enjoy this free game. So for games with gold, uh, we get, uh,
4789280	4798160	let's see, it looks like TT Isle of Man. And if he's, if you get to see some TTs in the island,
4798160	4808320	it is a motorcycle racing game. Oh, joy. And Call of Cthulhu on Xbox 360 compatible games,
4808320	4813840	Fable Heroes. Oh, cool. Um, I don't know if that's cool because it looks terrible.
4813840	4819840	A Fable Heroes in Star Wars Battlefront, the old one. Oh, um, so those are going to be coming
4819840	4825760	in February. OK. In the PlayStation side of things, we are going to be getting, um,
4825760	4830800	Bioshock the collection. Okay. That's really rad. Pretty awesome. Uh, you know, just, you know,
4830800	4838800	a lot of people, a lot of speculation that this is coming out as a free in quotes game. Um, because
4838800	4844160	there's a, the new Bioshock will be one of the big reveals at PlayStation fives reveal.
4845280	4849680	I hope so. The infinite was great. I mean, all of them have been pretty, I think the only one
4849680	4855040	I haven't played through is two. I played through one infinite. Two was different because Ken Levine
4855040	4861600	wasn't directly involved with two, but like I played and I didn't do the DLC on all that stuff
4861600	4866000	as well. But, um, I don't know. I don't think you need to, it's not really the full, you know,
4866000	4869760	the full game. I hope the news about Bioshock making a return on the next generation is true
4869760	4874320	though, which by the way, real quickly, just aside with PlayStation five and reveals and all that,
4874320	4878960	there was a fake tweet going around this last week from an account that looked like it was
4878960	4882640	the official PlayStation account, but it wasn't. If you check the spelling it's wrong and there's
4882640	4887840	no check Mark on the account. And it was trying to say, uh, PlayStation five unveiled February
4887840	4894000	15th at the theater and knew the PlayStation theater knew that was a false tweet. So if you
4894000	4899760	retweeted that going OMG or whatever, congrats, you fell for a misinformation campaign. Uh, granted,
4899760	4904160	it was probably somebody in their basement just acting like a fool or somebody trying to impress
4904160	4909440	their friends by going viral with a lie. Um, but unfortunately there's a lot of that type of
4909440	4914400	bullshit on Twitter. So please, please, please be careful. Uh, when you retweet things, if
4914400	4919040	something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If you're only reading about it on Twitter
4919040	4923360	and nowhere else. I mean, it depends, it depends what we're talking about. If we're talking about
4923360	4928960	people on the ground at a scene somewhere where something is unfolding, then maybe, but even in
4928960	4932560	those cases, you always have some jackass that isn't really there. That's trying to put their
4932560	4938400	own thing into it. So just, you know, be careful and, uh, don't be the one that spreads around
4938400	4943600	misinformation. Anyway, I said, cause I saw a lot of that retweeted with OMG and I'm like,
4943600	4951040	y'all Twitter security one Oh one, come on. All right. Um, the Sims four is the other game that
4951040	4958960	would be getting in a PlayStation VR firewall, um, zero hour. So check those out. I don't think I
4958960	4963440	have the collection. I have the collection on PC. So I'll be, I, yeah, I definitely don't have it
4963440	4968240	on PS four. I have both those games. I think at one point they gave out Bioshock and Bioshock
4968240	4973280	infinite on PS three, but you can go way back to PlayStation plus back then. I think they gave
4973280	4977920	those games away before, but we haven't seen the, uh, you know, uh, remaster good. It's worth
4977920	4982800	going through. I haven't, you know, I haven't played those in a while. Infinite was super great.
4982800	4990400	Yeah. Um, and then also we have a speaking of nostalgic and flash, um, the behemoth, uh, they
4990400	4995920	talked about what their next project is going to be, which is alien hominid invasion. So it's going
4995920	5001680	to be an all new re-imagining of the, the first game that the studio put out. And of course you
5001680	5007840	may remember them not only from alien hominid, but of course castle crashers. So we'll have to
5007840	5013520	see what this is going to be. It says it's going to be a co-op arcade shooter, similar to metal
5013520	5019120	slug, but I mean, hominid was pretty fun and castle crashers is fun. So this is probably
5019120	5024160	going to be fun. Can't wait. Yeah. Looking forward to it. Um, mentioned earlier in the show by dark
5024160	5028800	Sakura, uh, kind of referenced here, there is a new animal crossing switch coming out. She's just
5028800	5034240	a little irritated. It's not a switch light. It is a regular switch with the dock, but, uh, if that's
5034240	5040560	what you're looking for, it's fucking cute. Uh, like I, I'm, I cannot justify spending $300 cause
5040560	5044000	something's fucking cute, but if I didn't have a switch yet, this would probably be the one I'm
5044000	5048160	getting. Uh, it's coming out on March 13th and it's going to have very cute green and blue.
5048160	5052480	They're kind of like the, the colors of the ocean a little bit. So that kind of like softer green
5052480	5058160	and blue. Uh, those are the colors. It's, it's not an ingress switch, uh, is that different,
5058160	5061920	different types of green and blues, uh, that are showing up. But I think it's really cute.
5061920	5067120	Uh, and there'll be actually be a dock that actually has, um, uh, little, uh, Tom Nook and,
5067120	5072160	and his, uh, kids on it. And then like the switch itself on the back is really adorable.
5072160	5076480	And yeah, honestly, if I didn't have a switch yet, or like I'm finally breaking down and getting a
5076480	5082480	switch because of Animal Crossing, like this would be the way to go unless you really want
5082480	5087680	a light for your situation. Then unfortunately nothing has been announced for you yet. And I kind
5087680	5092880	of feel like with this news, they're not going to announce a light. Um, anything's possible,
5092880	5099920	I suppose, but doesn't look bloody likely. So anyhow, also in other news, uh, we, we have a
5099920	5106320	story about, uh, Ninja's management firm, um, which, uh, is, um, trying to figure out what
5106320	5117840	the name of it is here. Um, anyway, the firm that he is with is trying to reach out more into
5117840	5122720	diversity. Um, which I think is, is a good thing to talk about. You know, we've talked a lot about
5122720	5130400	these streamers that have moved from Twitch to YouTube or Twitch to Mixer. And, you know,
5130400	5135440	we got a lot of white dudes in there, which, you know, there's a lot of cool white. I'd like to
5135440	5140720	think Loki and I are pretty cool white dudes, but you know what? I know some pretty cool women. I
5140720	5145600	know some pretty cool people of color and all these people do streaming as well. And it would
5145600	5151520	just be nice to maybe see, you know, some folks in the big leagues that are a little bit more
5151520	5157040	reflective of what the population of the entire world looks like and not just one part of it.
5157040	5162240	Um, one very small part of it. So, um, yeah, I think this is very good that, you know,
5162240	5167840	they're trying to push to get more, uh, folks, you know, signed with this and pushing forward
5167840	5173200	with trying to bring a little more diversity, uh, into the streaming world, which is, uh, great.
5173200	5179760	Um, so, uh, let's see, I'm trying to see where the action is here. Uh, Loaded is the name of
5179760	5185200	the company. Thank you. Um, and, uh, they represent 36 gaming content creators.
5185200	5189920	Five of them are women. Uh, and they're saying we're actively seeking to diversify our portfolio
5189920	5193520	of talent, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it's also what's best for the
5193520	5198000	business and industry. Those who are in a position to, to should be thinking about this and doing
5198000	5202080	what they can to more accurately represent diversity within their ranks and content
5202080	5205680	in order to accelerate this leaders in our industry need to support women and other minority
5205680	5209360	groups to create a more inviting and supportive landscape for everyone. It's something Loaded
5209360	5213760	will be intentional about. And I look forward to playing a big role in our strategy there.
5213760	5219760	So, um, best of luck. And I, I hope we hear about some more names, uh, from all types of
5219760	5224720	individuals. So let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Let's start in the
5224720	5230480	U S Loki. All right. We've got, I mean, I guess this is tying in with the, the new show, but the
5230480	5236480	dark crystal age of resistance tactics. So, you know, they just screen that while I was out of
5236480	5241920	town for work, uh, Alan went to the crest and saw like a screening, I guess there it's in movie
5241920	5246720	theaters for a hot minute too. So yeah, I thought it was pretty cool. Uh, that's coming out on PC,
5246720	5252640	Mac, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one. We have zombie army for dead war. That's on
5252640	5261520	PC PlayStation four and Xbox one and a grand blue fantasy versus on PlayStation four marooners on
5261600	5268000	Nintendo switch and crash drive two on Nintendo switch. That is it. All right.
5268800	5272400	Let's go to Japan and check out some of the releases coming out there. And now that we're
5272400	5277120	getting into February, if you can believe it, uh, getting into February's releases in Japan,
5277120	5283200	uh, I don't think there's a ton of stuff. Uh, in fact, this week, I think we just have
5283760	5287600	some peripherals coming out, some stickers and things. I don't see any games, at least on the
5287600	5291920	switch. I know there's a new Hatsune Miku game coming out, um, next week, but we'll talk about
5291920	5296320	that next week. Uh, in the meantime, let me see if there's anything on PlayStation four
5297120	5301280	that is on its way. Oh yes. We have a little bit more on the PlayStation four grand blue
5301280	5307920	fantasy versus is out this week. A game called, is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon
5307920	5312640	infinite combat? I feel like we had a similarly named game before and it was an anime based thing.
5312640	5318320	Well, yeah, I mean, I can tell you right. That's that question shall be answered this
5318320	5322720	week in Japanese releases. Is it wrong to try to pick up girls into dungeon? Uh, grand blue
5322720	5329280	fantasy versus also out on the PlayStation four this week and ease nine, apparently a new pressing
5329280	5332960	of that. Cause I think that game has been out, but I guess a new version of it and also a rugby game,
5332960	5339280	rugby 20, uh, meaning for 2020, I'm sure also out in Japan this week. Um, how about the UK?
5339840	5346480	All right. UK don't have a whole lot coming out. Uh, mainly just, uh, monster energy supercross
5346480	5355200	three on PlayStation. We have a X-Box switch and PC, uh, zombie army for dead war on X-Box
5355200	5367040	one and PlayStation four and that's it. All right. Um, let's move on to the email bag.
5367360	5372160	Every week you guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send
5372160	5376480	those emails and we read some of our favorites here on air. So you should send us an email for
5376480	5381600	a future week. Participate at orange lounge radio.com and we're going to get to our,
5381600	5386720	I think this is the one and only email we have this week. Yeah. So our email tonight is from Rob.
5386720	5390480	I like your name. Uh, I don't recognize the email, so I don't think this is the Rob,
5390480	5396080	but, but, uh, and this is only Rob with one B like me. So I don't think it's just, it's just,
5396080	5401200	it's just plain Rob like me, one B. Uh, so I believe this is a new emailer, although I could
5401200	5405920	be wrong. So I apologize if you've emailed before. Um, but usually dark soccer does this. So I will
5405920	5411120	just say I'm new here. Anyway, we have a pretty lengthy email, so let's get to it. Dear OLR.
5411120	5416800	I recently re-watched the legendary documentary King of Kong and it really made an impact on me.
5416800	5420720	For those who have not seen it, King of Kong is the story of an underdog, Steve Weeby,
5420720	5425280	trying to beat the donkey Kong arcade world record of Billy Mitchell. Uh, I know I've seen it and
5425440	5429760	I assume you've seen it as well. I have not. Oh, you haven't. Okay. Well, I I've seen, I don't
5429760	5434320	need to watch it. I, I understand. Uh, moving on. The interesting thing about watching this
5434320	5439440	documentary again was that since I had first watched it in 2007, video analysis has proved
5439440	5443760	that Billy Mitchell had actually illegally submitted his score using an emulator play
5443760	5448160	through, which prompted twin galaxies to remove all of his records from their database.
5448160	5452560	His good friend, Todd Rogers held hundreds of records and also had his records removed after
5452560	5457440	analysis proved that his scores were not even possible. Billy's other friends, Steve Sanders,
5457440	5463040	openly admitted to cheating in donkey Kong in the eighties. Were they friends? I don't know.
5463600	5469120	I mean, I guess they would all be part of this interesting fraternity of like dudes who scored
5469120	5477120	high in video games, but like, did they send each other Christmas cards? Like how I feel like friends
5477120	5482000	can be a very bad though. Like who lies about video game achievements? I mean, I kind of think
5482000	5485760	that's where the rest of this email is going. Let me finish it up. After processing all of this,
5485760	5489360	it started to paint a picture in my head of what actually happened in the eighties when video
5489360	5494480	arcade records were starting to be recorded. To me, it seems like it was a tight knit group of
5494480	5499840	record holders and Walter Day who protected each other, probably knowing full well that the scores
5499840	5504720	were not legit. They knew that by exposing the false high scores would, excuse me, they knew
5504720	5508800	that exposing the false high scores would compromise the integrity of twin galaxies
5508800	5513760	and their tight knit community. Hell, it even questioned if their small town of Otumwa was
5513760	5517840	actually the video game capital of the world, whatever that means. Makes you wonder how many
5517840	5522800	people were cheated out of the glory of a high score back in the day. Just curious if you thought
5522800	5528240	this was a widespread issue within twin galaxies or just a few bad apples. Were you disappointed
5528240	5532960	knowing one of the greatest video game legends turned out to be a shame? Would love to hear your
5532960	5541120	thoughts. And that is from Rob. So, is Fifth Dream today suggesting this is Mr. Awesome?
5542880	5548000	Is this Mr. Awesome secretly sending this email? This really does sound like a Mr. Awesome, right?
5548000	5552480	This goes, okay, the reason why they keep bringing back up Mr. Awesome is that goes back to when this
5552480	5557600	program was on All Games Radio and the kind of flagship show over there, All Games Interact,
5557600	5562000	because I remember I drove down to the studio. I was in LA once when they were doing All Games
5562000	5565680	Interactive and Scott Rubin. And it was one of those Mr. Awesome episodes because he was showing
5565680	5569840	up all the time. And I was like, Oh my God, what the fuck have I walked in? Like, it's like, it was
5569840	5574000	like, it was like a fucking soap opera, all this twin galaxy stuff. I don't even remember the
5574000	5579760	details. I just remember the catch phrases, like, you know, let me finish because I let you finish
5579760	5584800	all that stuff. And just, it was crazy. Anyway, what do you think about this whole issues and
5584800	5589520	twin galaxies and so forth? I'm over it already. In fact, I wouldn't even say I'm over it because
5589520	5600000	I never was even interested in it. So I'm very still an interested in it. It's just drama in
5600000	5605120	like shit I don't even care about. Like the only time I ever cared about like world records was
5605120	5609760	when I did that stupid, um, ready player one competition, which that was a whole bunch of
5609760	5614960	bullshit anyways. It was like simple, simple shit. Oh, Hey, by the way, break a world record now.
5614960	5620400	Okay. Fuck you. How about that? Um, I don't know. I just, I don't care.
5621600	5627360	My answer to this is kind of complicated. I just think twin galaxies is a relic of a different
5627360	5633520	time is what it really is. Like twin galaxies is what existed in the eighties. Cause one thing,
5633520	5638080	okay. There's cause one little thing that like with your email where I'm kind of like,
5638080	5642560	eh, I think there's kind of like a jump that's happening here is the part that talks about,
5642560	5646560	uh, Billy Mitchell illegally submitted his score using an emulator playthrough,
5646560	5649920	which prompted twin galaxies to remove all of his records from their database.
5649920	5653200	They didn't have emulators in the eighties. I don't think you could emulate donkey Kong
5653200	5660720	accurately on a PC until the late nineties. When did maim start late nineties? My point is,
5660720	5664960	and I'm not like, I'm not discounting your points and some of this other crap that came out and I'm
5664960	5670000	well aware of the many conspiracy theories and all this stuff and the videos and all this stuff.
5670000	5677040	Here's what it is. Do I think these guys are very good at video games from the 1980s? I do.
5677040	5680880	Are they better than me? Yes, they are. Are they the best in the world?
5682560	5689600	They're the best that this person, Walter Day, who put together this organization that nobody
5689600	5695680	else was willing to do in the 1980s and run things his way, just whether you liked it or
5695680	5700640	not in this whole thing, you know, the videotapes and all that stuff, this was what he was able to
5700640	5707120	collaborate. And to his credit for better or for worse, they were the first to try to make video
5707120	5713680	games a bit video gamers, shall we say a bit of a celebrity. It's because of things like
5713680	5722160	twin galaxies that we, um, later on ended up, um, uh, you know, getting the, the magazine spreads
5722160	5727040	and things like this of these guys who were very good at video games. Were they the best in the
5727040	5732480	world? Hard to say. They're the best that were able to be found through this process. They probably
5732480	5736960	weren't the best in the world. They were, cause you know, there's always somebody better, right?
5736960	5740560	But they were the best that was able to be found through this process. My point is,
5741200	5746720	look at where we're at now in the year 2020. Lots of people can become video game celebrities
5746720	5752880	because it's so easy to just start your own channel on Twitch or make a YouTube thing or,
5752880	5757840	uh, do something else. Right. And so now it's like more people were finding these
5757840	5762960	awesome gamers all over because it's so much easier to kind of start your own thing.
5762960	5767360	And of course with the technology and everything, now we get more exposed to things like emulators
5767360	5773600	and some of these other things where people cheat. So are maybe some of these people cheating because
5774400	5778880	they want to hold on to some sense of relevancy. It's almost like a midlife crisis.
5779520	5785280	Like these guys were what, 18, 20 years old in the eighties. So how old are they now?
5785280	5789760	They're at like fifties and something like that. And maybe are there some that are willing to go
5789760	5797040	to a length that is somewhat questionable to maintain some sense of relevancy in an era
5797040	5802640	that is making the video game celebrity culture of the 1980s and maybe early nineties irrelevant
5802640	5810160	today, perhaps. But are they all cheating on purpose? I don't know. Hard to say. I haven't,
5810160	5817760	I'm not gonna, and respectfully, I'm not going to waste my time on five hour YouTubes that dissect
5817760	5822800	these, you know, did Billy Mitchell play on a rogue machine and submit a score that way?
5822800	5827200	I don't fucking know, to be honest. Um, the reality is we know there's a better Donkey Kong
5827200	5831120	player. Right. And it was, and it wasn't either of these guys. It was that dentist or no guy.
5831200	5834560	It's even gone fucking back and forth, right? There was the dentist. I don't know. And I don't
5834560	5839600	care. I've already like so lost interest in it, but now that we're in the year 2020 or even the
5839600	5845760	late 2010s, if we're talking about just the recent past couple of years, the, the easeability of,
5845760	5850080	of filming your own thing and putting it out there, you don't necessarily need something
5850080	5855440	like twin galaxies to be a warehouse of all these records that go through a strategic screening.
5855440	5858800	Cause you can just make your own, put it on YouTube and say, here's my score. Here's my
5858800	5864160	receipts. Bam. I don't need Walter blessings or Walter Day's blessing in order to claim that as
5864160	5870400	my score where in the 1980s you did. So I just, my long winded answer here is to kind of say,
5870400	5876240	like, I just think the culture has changed so much that we don't need a Pope to bless
5876240	5882320	these high scores anymore. That twin galaxies in that form is not really relevant anymore.
5882320	5886320	And that's why we talk about these Oh two more jokes and things where it's like,
5886320	5893280	they're trying to hold onto that relevancy, but it's, it's unfortunately technology and where
5893280	5898400	we've gone. It's just not the same. Now I'm not going to talk about twin galaxies as an
5898400	5902640	organization because a, I don't really know what they're doing these days, but I would hope they've
5902640	5906320	kind of maybe transformed. I think they were running like a media network, a channel at some
5906320	5911760	point, maybe celebrating classic gaming and cool. That's what it should be at this point is, you
5911760	5915360	know what, we're going to celebrate classic gaming. We're going to still party like it's
5915360	5919840	1985 and that these are, you know, the big games, the moment and so forth. But the reality is the
5919840	5924240	culture and the celebrity and all that shit has changed as far as Billy Mitchell cheating and all
5924240	5931280	that. My only counter question, because this is the thought that comes to mind. Does, does he know
5931280	5937040	maybe he's cheating in every circuit? Like here's the thing I've played a lot of Pac-Man machines
5937120	5941440	over time. I couldn't tell you which ones were running on an emulator potentially,
5941440	5945920	or which ones were tweaked behind the scenes to possibly produce a different score.
5945920	5951440	If he was playing machine at a different place, is it possible that he just didn't know the machine?
5951440	5954480	I don't know. And I know there's a lot of Billy Mitchell haters out there that would say, yes,
5954480	5959200	he knew it was all a scam and all this stuff. Maybe, I don't know, but I just also kind of
5959200	5965760	think maybe he wasn't in on it. I mean, he was good at Donkey Kong. He's played the game live
5965760	5970480	for people before and so forth. Is he the best in the world? I guess that's debatable at this
5970480	5976080	point. Is he better than me and most people? Probably. Definitely. So here's another thing
5976080	5981200	about Billy Mitchell you may not be aware of. I met the guy. I met the guy a couple of times.
5981920	5985120	I don't expect that he knows me or recognizes me by name or anything, but it's not about that. I'm
5985120	5989040	not big on celebrity culture anyway, but I've met the guy a couple of times and I'm going to tell
5989040	5995600	you something. He's a pretty nice guy and nothing like what you see in the YouTubes and the movies
5995600	6001040	and all this stuff. Billy Mitchell that you guys all see is playing a character. He's playing a
6001040	6007120	part. Just recently Paris Hilton came out and said, yes, I was playing a part that whole time
6007120	6010160	during A Simple Life. I knew exactly what was going on and where I stood. And there's some
6010160	6013600	people that say, yeah, right. And there's other people that say, I knew it the whole fucking time
6013600	6018160	and I'm one of those people. I knew it. Paris Hilton's fucking smart. I know. I said it,
6018160	6021280	quote it, put it on the back of the box. Paris Hilton's fucking smart. She knew what she was
6021280	6025200	doing to that whole time making money and so forth. Sometimes you're playing a character
6025200	6028720	and it's one of those things where like, you know what? Even the negative coverage,
6028720	6032320	it's still coverage. It's getting you talked about. It's selling hot sauce,
6033200	6039520	you know, or whatever it is, right? So, but like I've been around when Billy's having one-on-one
6039520	6044400	conversations. He's had one-on-one conversations with me and this might shock you. He's just a
6044400	6050800	normal fucking person. He's just a normal person like you, like me. I'm a normal fucking person too,
6050800	6057760	really. I am. So, people only put these guys up on pedestals because I don't know. So,
6058640	6061920	and I'm not, I'm not talking bad about Billy Mitchell. I'm actually not. I'm actually telling
6061920	6070320	you guys, he's a nice guy, but I also don't get into all these weeds and all this stuff about,
6070320	6075600	you know, all this, all this. So, I don't know. Those are my long thoughts. I'll check chat.
6075600	6079520	Loki, you have any thoughts on this? No, still not interested in what, you know,
6081360	6086960	I get it. You're good at playing the game. Good for you. Yeah, that's it. I mean,
6088880	6091920	at some point you're not going to be the best and then you just have to get used to it.
6092960	6096000	Let's see some comments in chat. Fifth dream today says, I'm friends with people who have
6096000	6102240	been in movies and in bands. Everyone is just people. That's very true. Retro DeLorean in
6102240	6106800	chat says, is there an equivalent of Billy Mitchell for pinball machines? I don't know
6106800	6110400	if you're the person who sent these emails, but we actually did get a follow-up and I just fucking
6110400	6113840	closed it because I'm a genius, but essentially that was the question. The follow-up was for Dark
6113840	6117280	Sakura, who I'm sorry, she's left the building. So, I can't ask her directly. I'll have to ask
6117280	6121360	her for next week, but is there an equivalent of that in the pinball world? And my answer is,
6121360	6127120	I don't think so. I don't know anyone with that kind of personality, but they haven't really done
6127120	6133600	movies of pinball besides like Tommy, but that's very different. So, I don't think that exists,
6133600	6137120	but there are certainly are world record holders, I'm sure in pinball as well.
6138080	6144640	And I would say a lot of, just after OLR last week, we hosted some people playing a theater
6144640	6150880	or magic machine out in the pinball world. So, everything I said about the culture has changed
6150880	6155120	and you can broadcast your own high scores. You don't need to go through a central hub or
6155120	6160000	anything to do that anymore, would be true about pinball as well. So, if there is a celebrity,
6160000	6164240	I would say just hearing Dark Sakura, when she talks about like the pinballs in classic games,
6164240	6168080	I would say the pinball makers are the more celebrities in that world because she talks
6168080	6172720	about certain machines by certain people and that's what she plays. So, I think the celebrity
6172720	6178080	has probably went to them. Tiger Claw on chat says, how do you make movies about pinball
6178080	6183200	interesting? Dude, the same way somebody made King of Kong, is Donkey Kong that interesting
6183200	6193120	for two hours? No, but it was the drama, the good guy versus the bad guy. It was all that shit that
6193120	6197360	made people get into that movie at the level they did. It was a very well done documentary.
6197360	6203600	There's another one and god damn it, I can't remember the name. I don't think it was Chasing
6203600	6209680	Ghosts, maybe it was, but there was another one, god damn it. It was a very obscure arcade game,
6209680	6214560	the two were playing and the guy was supposed to like mimic the performer. They were always going
6214560	6219520	against each other at like magfest. I remember like one of the early magfests was the climax of
6219520	6224320	the film. It was like an early magfest towards the, it was a snake game that they were playing
6224320	6229920	and I think the name of the movie had something to do with snakes. Anyway, that was another one
6229920	6234880	that I'd watched. That was it, yes, Dark Tetsuya, that's right, Man vs Snake, that was the name of it,
6234880	6239280	which I know it doesn't sound like a video game movie. It sounds like something a little
6239280	6243360	perverted, but it was, it was very much, yes, Nibbler, that was it. Thank you, Dark Tetsuya,
6243360	6246720	that was the documentary I'm thinking of. That was an interesting one as well.
6249520	6254240	Other comments in chat, let's see, SG100Matt says, the documentary was good, it did take some
6254240	6259760	liberties with the drama. It made it seem like Billy dodged Weebie when he really didn't.
6259760	6263280	Fifth Dream Today says, I've heard Billy intentionally acts like a jerk whenever
6263280	6267280	a camera's on him but is otherwise an okay guy. True.
6269920	6275200	Questbuster says, back then you had to have some, you had to have a trusted someone as a witness,
6275200	6281280	VHS tapes, photographers, and then check a monthly magazine for local scores, if even that, lots of
6281280	6285600	holes for anything to happen back in those days. Oh, and Retro DeLorean does say in chat, I submitted
6285600	6291920	this question and I can assure you I am not Mr. Awesome. All right, all right, well, you better
6291920	6296800	not be. All right, no, I'm just kidding. So, but thank you for the email. I mean, it is, it's an
6296800	6301600	interesting topic and I see why people get into it. And I think the documentary has really like
6301600	6306160	perpetuated that a lot, but I think the reality is it's like, you know, the standards of tracking
6306160	6311280	video game scores and video game accomplishments in the 1980s was just different than it is today.
6311280	6316480	And look at the celebrity culture around gaming today. It's not necessarily about high scores.
6316480	6320480	Is Ninja good at Fortnite? Well, he is kind of good at Fortnite actually, from what I understand,
6320480	6325440	he plays a lot of it, right? But is he the best in the world at Fortnite? I don't think he is.
6325440	6329840	Some of the best streamers out there and, you know, the people that are the celebrities now
6329840	6337360	aren't necessarily the people that are great at video games. So, you know, anyway. All right,
6337360	6340720	great question though. Thank you very much for that. And that was our only email this week.
6340720	6346000	If you would like to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6346000	6349680	We do have some more stories for you guys before we get to opening up Discord to see if there's
6349680	6354560	any calls tonight, even though I know tonight is a little weird with all that's going on on
6354560	6359920	the television and so forth. Although I guess that did wrap up. But I think more and more people
6359920	6364160	are tuning in now that that's over. But, you know, I understand some people are like Bobby
6364160	6367920	Blackwolf didn't do a show tonight because he went to a party and it's the one time a year he
6367920	6373120	gets to see certain people. I get it. So, yes, I may not be into the Super Bowl, but I understand
6373120	6377120	it's a cultural thing for some people. All right. But we have some stories. Let's get into it.
6377120	6381440	Yes. So we talked this has been a while since we talked about this, but you may remember there was
6381440	6389680	a company in Japan that was operating a Mario Kart type go kart experience. We were dressed
6389680	6396640	up in costume and drive go karts around Japan. Oh, yeah, I do remember that. Well, is formerly
6396640	6403920	known as Mar Marikar. They got in trouble with Nintendo before Nintendo said, stop doing that.
6403920	6410240	And then they basically say, hey, we're unrelated to Nintendo. But then they went ahead and did it
6410240	6422240	again as now Mario Mobile Mobility is the company mobility. And cleverly now they have Nintendo has
6422240	6430720	been awarded a total of four or 50 million yen in response to this, basically saying that Nintendo
6431440	6435920	said it would continue to take steps against violations of intellectual property and brands
6435920	6442320	and has worked hard to establish over many years. I mean, kind of had to come in. They already got
6442320	6448080	warning saying, hey, you can't do this. Stop it. You cease this. And they're like, we're going to
6448080	6453120	do it anyways. And they're like, OK, well, you're just going to get sued then. So, well, you know
6453120	6459920	why now, especially to. Where are you going to where do you get to play official Mario Kart
6460480	6467120	simulations in the very new future starting? Yes. And in Japan at Universal theme parks. Yeah. So
6467120	6471680	it's the Universal theme park expansion, I'm sure is it. This is probably one of those things where
6471680	6477280	Universal's tapping Nintendo on the shoulder saying, hey, yeah, I doubt I doubt I had anything
6477280	6484000	to do with universal. It's more of just like, hey, you know, you guys are you're kind of borrowing
6484000	6489200	our former property, you know, and we've already asked you this stuff. In fact, they said that they
6489200	6498080	were originally awarded 10 million yen, but they apparently they tried to appeal it. So as part of
6498080	6507040	that appeal, they increased the damages to 50 million. So that's hilarious. Well, so if Nintendo
6507040	6511680	says to stop, you probably should stop. Yeah, because here's here's what the site said. So
6512080	6519360	mobility, they said we have street carts and this is horribly broken English. We had street carts
6519360	6526800	is providing our service as usual. Street carts is fully comply, as I see through local governing
6526800	6531120	laws in Japan. Street carts is in no way a reflection of Nintendo, the game Mario Kart.
6531120	6537360	We do not provide rental of Mario costumes. Oh, people are showing up in Mario costumes,
6537360	6540080	probably taking pictures and stuff. I don't know about that, but probably,
6540640	6548720	I mean, just for the pictures before, you know. Yeah, I don't know. I thought they had a thing
6548720	6552480	like this in the States, too, like there was something in L.A. or something that was kind of
6552480	6558240	like this. Well, and then, you know what? So we we we are not far because by your laser tag place,
6558240	6563440	there is a go kart place. Yes. And I've only done that one time ever. But the one time I did it,
6563440	6568960	I was like, this is like Mario Kart in real life. But without the show, I haven't been there since
6568960	6574480	the because the original place that was there, what they were gas powered go karts when I
6574480	6578240	originally went there. So you had to like when you were racing them, you had to put on the full
6578240	6583520	helmet. You had to put on a jumpsuit. Was it not like that? They're electric now. Oh, and so
6583520	6588240	they're they're quieter. They don't smell like fuel. Oh, yeah. That whole place smelled like
6588240	6594320	gasoline. Yeah. No, not anymore. It's all electric. So and they before it used to be
6594320	6598560	split up in the two different tracks, they like a really short track and a longer track. Now it's
6598560	6603840	all one huge track. Oh, and so it's way different now. But I just haven't gotten to do it because
6603840	6608000	it's expensive. I think we need to do something for our we need it. Oh, our team building night.
6608560	6612720	We should totally do that. You know, I've been doing lately, though. I've been going
6613280	6618480	rollerblading. Oh, really? We went to the rink twice. Is the rink that's in between all this?
6618480	6623600	No, no, no, not that Rika. Sunrise Rollerland. But OK, you know, because my kids got skates now
6623600	6628800	and they have this new thing where which is kind of cool. So you can sign them up for like it's
6628800	6633920	like four dollars a kid and then they'll send you coupons each week for two free skiing sessions
6633920	6641440	every week forever. So it's like it pays for itself already. Interesting. But yeah, I enjoy
6641440	6647200	it now that I've got my nice skates. All right. Well, moving on to another story about when
6647200	6651440	Nintendo tells you to stop, you should probably stop. We have other news this week that a
6651440	6655920	California man is getting in a lot of trouble with Nintendo and for some other pretty big
6655920	6662160	reasons as well. This guy's resident of Palmdale's name is Ryan Hernandez. He pleaded guilty to
6662160	6667680	federal charges of hacking Nintendo systems, which is computer fraud and abuse and possessing child
6667680	6674000	pornography, which is definitely the worst thing that he did. But being that we're reading stories
6674000	6679920	from game blogs, these game blogs tend to focus on the video game part of the story. But you but
6679920	6685680	anyway, the video game part of the story is that he phished Nintendo employees to get credentials
6685680	6690400	in 2016 and used that to get confidential information, which was then leaked to the public.
6691360	6695760	Details about the Nintendo switch even leaked before March 2017 when it was actually debuted.
6695760	6702400	This all according to court records. Now, the FBI caught him and he said he would stop. But what
6702400	6711280	happened? He pulled the Mari car. Oops. I did it again. He got in and the FBI seized the devices in
6711280	6717840	June 2019. He broke into multiple servers, got information, bragged about it on his Discord and
6717840	6723200	Twitter while leaking other data elsewhere. He also shared vulnerabilities in Nintendo's network
6723200	6728160	with the community. Big yikes to all that. But if you ever wondered where some of these leaks come
6728160	6734560	from, realize that not all of it is my uncle works for such and such place. The phishing and all this
6734560	6742320	shit, that stuff's very real. That's phishing. You know how like in the news, they always talk about
6742320	6749200	Hillary's emails, butter emails. Well, the hacking of the DNC, which to be fair was a little bit
6749200	6752800	different than the Hillary emails issue, but this all kind of got looped in together about email
6752800	6758800	issues, right? So the hacking of the DNC, that was phishing. That was phishing. How did Russia
6758800	6762560	get in and get those emails? And I'm not trying to like get into politics or pick a side. I'm just
6762560	6767840	stating this is what happened. So Russia sent a phishing email to somebody that worked at the DNC
6767840	6770800	who clicked on it, fell for it, gave the credentials, and that's how they got in and got
6770800	6775920	the emails. Okay. Nonpolitical Sony pictures. When all that information got hacked. Remember
6775920	6780960	all those emails from Sony pictures? When Carrillo was pissed off about that movie that portrayed
6780960	6784960	Ken John Moon in a negative light, and then they hacked Sony pictures and got all that shit on the
6784960	6790640	internet. Yeah. Yeah. That was a phishing email as well. So like a lot of places of business in
6790640	6796560	this day and age really train their employees. Yeah. They keep sending us fake phishing emails
6796560	6800720	all the time. And if you accidentally click on it, then they're like, you got to watch another
6800720	6805200	training video. It's like, ah, yep. So just something to think about when you looked at
6805200	6809760	leaked information, it may not have always come from the cleanest of sources. So just,
6809760	6814560	just saying is what it is. Anyhow. So this plea bargain, he will be sentenced to three
6814560	6820320	years in prison, $259,000 in restitution to Nintendo, and will be registered as a sex
6820320	6829040	offender. He will be sentenced on April 21st. But the, it would be, I guess even I don't,
6829040	6833520	so he took a plea bargain of three years, even though the child pornography can carry up to 20
6833520	6838640	years for that whole thing. So I don't know the ins and outs of all that. I'm going to admit,
6838640	6844080	but he is going to prison because he said he would stop doing it and he kept doing it anyway.
6844080	6848640	And then, you know, you also have this whole hideous issue of the child pornography as well,
6848640	6854800	which I don't want to, you know, overlook that as why this individual went to prison. So anyway,
6855680	6860480	so anyway, gross, ugly. I want to move on from that, but I did kind of want to make the point,
6860480	6864320	you know, what's, and, you know, we talk about leaks and stuff here too. Granted,
6865040	6867760	we talk about it when it's already on Twitter and all those other places. I mean,
6867760	6872480	we're not going to be idiots and pretend, oh, this doesn't exist. But sometimes we have to
6872480	6879360	remember these leaks and things, they don't always come from a squeaky clean source. So anyway,
6879360	6882800	something to think about. Meanwhile, let's move on. We have a couple more stories for you guys.
6882800	6888720	Loki. All right. I don't know why you would want to do this to yourself, but you can.
6888720	6896160	So apparently someone made a fan, untitled Goose desktop app that basically is called
6896160	6903280	Goose desktop. And it's kind of a play on entitled Goose game, obviously. So what it does
6903280	6910160	is it will actually unleash a goose onto your desktop, which will then do all sorts of things,
6910160	6920560	including, you know, steal your mouse cursor. It will even like pop windows open. I don't know why
6920560	6927600	you would want to do this to yourself, but. But yeah, you can have like, it'll try to steal your
6927600	6933920	screens. That seems the type of thing you prank your coworker with on their computer, honk.
6933920	6940560	It is, yes. So yes, if you're interested in checking it out, though, it is on itch.io. And
6942240	6948720	yeah, I don't know if I would want to do this to myself. I just think. I think I would just
6948720	6952400	drive myself nuts. It would drive me a little nuts, too. It's one of those things. It's kind
6952400	6957200	of funny, though. Yeah, it's funny. Fifth dream today in chat says, I miss Windows 95 desktop
6957200	6961840	buddies. Quest Buster says, this reminds me, we need Indiana Jones desktop adventures back.
6961840	6967280	You know, would y'all be mad if we made After Dark, the classic game of the week, some week?
6967280	6971600	It's not really a game, but After Dark is kind of iconic. Y'all know what After Dark is? Do you
6971600	6976800	know what you know? After dark screensavers, screensavers, iconic flying toasters. Yes,
6977280	6982080	that was a screensaver. That was After Dark. So, and sometimes the screensavers were things that
6982080	6986320	were like fucking with your desktop. Like there was like desktop shuffle that would just shuffle
6986320	6995120	the pieces of your desktop in a like slide puzzle type of fashion. So yeah, I'm looking at the
6995120	7002400	little video, whatever. So it just, it drags stuff onto your screen and tracks mud all over the place
7002400	7008640	and all of your stuff. It causes like weird key presses and stuff to happen. I should put that on
7008640	7013680	Alan's computer when he's not here, Teehee. That would be funny. Yeah, for a minute and then I'd
7013680	7019360	get in a lot of trouble. Yes. Goose desktop, though. You can check that out. Samperson.itch.io
7019360	7023760	slash desktop dash goose. Install it on your grandparents' computer for a good time.
7024720	7031280	All right. I did not tell you to do that. All right. It's free. Free. Love that price.
7032400	7036320	All right. Moving on. A few more stories for you guys before we open up Discord calls.
7037040	7040640	And this one kind of ending on a sad note with this story. Well, I don't know if it's sad,
7040640	7046640	it's just a sign of the times. Nintendo of Japan is soon going to stop repairing the Wii. So the
7046640	7053040	Wii will no longer officially be supported. The Wii, of course, was released towards the end of 2006
7053040	7058960	and the Wii still was kind of going for a little bit. Just Dance 2020 came out on the Wii after
7059200	7064720	the Wii U and all that. Yes, yes. But all good things must come to an end. On their official
7064720	7069520	website, Nintendo of Japan said they plan to terminate all the opportunities to officially
7069520	7074000	repair the Wii. This means that Nintendo of America, Nintendo of Europe, and everybody else
7074000	7078880	is going to follow suit very soon. Why are they doing this? Due to the, quote, difficulty of
7078880	7084800	securing the parts necessary for repair. So the last date to get your Wii to Nintendo of Japan,
7084800	7092640	if you need a repair on it, is March 31st, 2020. And that's it. So the end of an era. So the Wii
7092640	7097200	will no longer be fixed and if yours breaks, then it is just a broken piece of garbage.
7098080	7105680	Plastic waste. Are you sad to see the Wii get retired? You know, I had my Wii in the garage
7106400	7111760	and then when my sister had watched our cat while we were in Disneyland, she took it.
7111760	7118320	The only thing that kind of makes me sad about this is that, you know, there's so much on the
7118320	7122880	Nintendo eShop that was on the Wii and then therefore the Wii U, because the Wii U was fully
7122880	7127440	backwards compatible with the Wii, we know that. And I guess you could still, they haven't
7127440	7132640	terminated support for the Wii U yet, but we kind of know that's coming, right? But my point is that
7132640	7137520	there were a lot of cute games on the Wii Shop, like let's say the Castlevania Adventure Rebirth,
7137520	7144400	right? That didn't come out anywhere else but the Wii Shop. Final Fantasy IV, the After Years.
7144400	7149600	I do believe that came out in its 3D form in other places, but I think the only place to play that in
7149600	7156320	2D is on the WiiWare. And PC or PSP, I think, also had a... Oh, you're right. You're right. But it
7156320	7162800	was also different. It was the upgraded textures, not the original sprites that the Wii version
7162800	7166960	used, like the original Final Fantasy IV sprites and everything. Yeah. So good point though,
7166960	7171440	that the PSP had it. But my point is, it's just a matter of time before these cute little things
7171440	7174080	that were on the WiiWare service, you're not really going to be able to play them anymore
7174080	7178080	because the systems can't handle them. And it's not like you can download these on the Switch or
7178080	7182160	anything like that. Alan, if you want to give me candy, just come over and hand it to me.
7182160	7184240	I want to see gold things fly across the screen.
7184240	7188400	I'm not going to catch it. If you throw that... What is that little piece of candy
7188400	7192640	that you're offering me? What is it? Offer me candy. Oh, this looks... Is this a peanut
7192640	7197440	butter cup? Fuck yeah. Do you want one, Loki? No. Oh, they're good. Dark Sakura brought... Ooh,
7197440	7200800	three peanut butters. Dark Sakura brought cookies, if you want one of those cookies.
7200800	7204080	Alan, do you want to say... I mean, we're ending a little early here. Do you want to say anything
7204080	7210720	about your gaming or the things that you've been playing lately? I updated Overwatch.
7212880	7219040	I updated Overwatch. It's on season 20. I know... I just... This isn't my first time on camera.
7219280	7225360	I updated Overwatch. They're on season 20 now. I think the last time I played was season eight
7225360	7229520	or nine. So it's been quite a while. There's only one new character that's been introduced,
7229520	7238960	Sigma, since I played. As far as what competitive mode is like, the players, the attitudes, the
7239680	7246240	slurs in chat, it's still bad. It's terrible. So this may be a shortly lived revisit.
7246800	7248240	How do you feel about Overwatch 2?
7255360	7263120	It exists. It will exist. It's a thing that Blizzard announced. I feel similar to... There's,
7263120	7267120	I guess, a big football game that happened. I know that's a thing. A lot of people are
7267120	7272160	invested in it. I'm happy for them. Or sad, depending on who they rooted for.
7272240	7277920	I feel similar about Overwatch 2. It is... It's a property. Blizzard's...
7277920	7281520	What about Warcraft 3 reforged?
7282400	7288400	Yeah. Well, I did not have any... I had no idea of all the stuff that went on with Warcraft 3
7288400	7292880	reforged. All that news went right over my head. So when you told me that they turned off Battle
7292880	7301120	Net for the original OG Warcraft 3, Blizzard, they don't know what they're doing. Or they do,
7301120	7308240	and they're terrible. Toons is the driving cat is apparently running things over there right now.
7308240	7311840	By the way, Alan, just because you are on camera, how much weight have you lost?
7313840	7318720	You've lost a lot of weight. In the last 12 months, I've lost about 30 pounds.
7318720	7324800	Congratulations. I'm not jealous or anything. So no, Alan's been doing the CrossFit thing and the
7324800	7330880	meal prep. I got him an Instapot for Christmas and he uses it for meal prep. And you would
7330880	7335040	think I would benefit from some of that weight loss stuff, but no, because I can't stop snacking.
7335040	7339920	So there you go. You get some congratulations from our chat, by the way. So there you go.
7339920	7343920	All right. Enjoy those peanut butter cups. You earned it. All right. Anything else we
7343920	7347360	want to say about the Wii or any of that stuff? Let me see. I'm going to go see.
7347360	7348800	It was a great system.
7349840	7350880	It was. And it said...
7350880	7356160	Where's my freaking Excite Truck sequel? Aside from Excite Bots, we don't count that.
7356240	7361360	vognetwork.com slash discord. If you want to get in our discord and give us a call,
7361360	7364240	or if you have a quick question, you can always post something in chat as well.
7364240	7367520	If you are like, I don't feel like calling, you can always pose a question here in chat.
7367520	7371360	If you'd like to talk about something else. I don't know if we have any last minute stories.
7371360	7374880	There was just something I saw on my Twitter feed. I was trying to look up is basically
7374880	7380080	something from Google saying that Stadia, they're complaining. People are complaining.
7380080	7385280	There's not enough games on Stadia. And they're like, it's not our fault that we're not announcing
7385280	7388800	games. If you want game announcements, you're going to talk to publishers to
7388800	7395280	announce games that are coming to Stadia. Um, Google, I would encourage you to look at
7395280	7400880	a product called the Wii U and why it flopped. And, uh, you might want to come up with a better
7400880	7405440	answer. Yeah. Cause they said we understand the desire to hear more specifics on games.
7405440	7411920	After all, that is what it is about games. Of course, not all 120 titles will be announced
7411920	7417600	by the Stadia team as we leave it up to publishers to make announcements about their IP slash games
7417600	7422880	and which platforms they'll appear on just as we do with our exclusive content coming to Stadia.
7422880	7427600	There are lots of reasons for time of those gaming or timing of those game announcements.
7427600	7432480	Anything from plan, promotions, events, title readiness, proximity to the first playable demo,
7432480	7434720	shareholder requirements, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7436080	7439840	By the way, I'm glad you brought this up because you reminded me, Oh, it's February. Now I need
7439840	7444960	to go, go grab the newest Stadia games. Cause again, I didn't buy Stadia, but, um, my pal
7444960	7448960	Bobby Black Wolf did, and he got a little friend pass thing and he was kind enough to give that
7448960	7452720	to me, which I think works for like three months. Um, so I think this is the month where it will
7452720	7459760	run out. Uh, but I was able to claim February's free games. I forgot that it's a new, so I got,
7459760	7464320	and I, I didn't even know what games there were. So the games I got were Metro Exodus.
7464400	7470640	That's cool. And, uh, guilt G Y L T, which I think that was their exclusive they had at launch.
7470640	7475520	Right. I think it was. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that was there. Yeah. Cause it didn't launch until
7475520	7481680	November 19th, 2019 and it's by tequila works, which I think was one of Google's, uh, in-house
7481680	7486240	things. So yeah. Thank you. Pixel pockets. Yes. That was the exclusive game. I thought so.
7486240	7489760	So I'll have to check that out at some point. All right. We do have a call waiting in the green
7489760	7494320	room. So why not? Uh, let's get to it and, uh, see what our listeners want to talk about. So
7494320	7500160	hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hi. Can you hear me? Hi. Yep. We can hear you.
7500160	7506640	What's your name? Oh, cool. This is retro. Hi there. Uh, what's on your mind tonight?
7507600	7511600	Hey, uh, yeah. So I was the one that asked the question about, uh,
7511600	7515680	the Billy Mitchell. That's why I just wanted to assure people that I am not Mr. Awesome.
7515680	7520720	Yeah. Am I crazy or did I pick up a, am I crazy or did I pick up a Canadian accent there?
7522000	7526240	Uh, yes, I am from Canada actually. So you're definitely not Mr. Awesome.
7527440	7532400	No, I am not Mr. Awesome. Um, but yeah, I wanted to just set the record straight about,
7532400	7537280	um, the reason I was kind of interested with that was, um, it was not so much even the drama. I just
7537280	7542880	thought, uh, I thought that that kind of whole segment of the internet that was talking about
7542880	7548480	all that was really centered around all of this kind of culture that seems to be kind of coming
7548480	7553760	forward. Like more recently, it seems like with the, all these one-up cabinets and all the retro
7553760	7559680	gaming aspects of it, I just thought it was kind of a neat topic that's coming forward now about
7559680	7565600	like the legacy of all these players. And, um, so I, yeah, I just want to, I was wanted to kind of
7565600	7570080	hear your thoughts about that just cause I thought since you were, you've talked a lot about retro
7570080	7575120	gaming and, and Jamie talks about the pinball and all that, that, uh, just that you might kind of,
7576240	7581840	you know, have an interesting perspective on that. Um, well, I hope, I hope you were good with the
7581840	7586000	perspective that I gave. Um, I think, I think, you know, but at the end of the day, it really is kind
7586000	7591760	of about celebrity culture has really shifted. And I do think some of the good old boys from
7591760	7597120	back in the day have probably really fought to remain relevant and they may or may not,
7597120	7601200	I don't know, cause I don't live in their houses and inspect their machines. They may or may not
7601200	7605360	have done some shady things to try to stay relevant. But the reality is, and I think,
7605360	7610160	I think the best point that I made was probably towards the end there. When you look at the cult
7610160	7615200	of video game celebrity today is that it's not necessarily the people who are the best
7615200	7620560	at video games that are the most famous because of it. Not to say that good gamers don't necessarily
7620560	7624800	get. So, I mean, when you think about like awesome games done quick and an event like that, like,
7624800	7629200	you know, those guys are in the spotlight now, granted I couldn't, can you name some speed
7629200	7635280	streamers that were with awesome games done quick recently? Yeah, it's, I don't know. I don't recall
7635280	7640240	their names as fast as you do Billy Mitchell. I do recognize there's talent. I only know like some
7640240	7646000	of the, um, Mario maker streamers because I watched a lot more of those like Carl Sagan,
7646000	7652480	um, Poop Grand Pooh Bear. Um, I remember the rest of them, but like, I know some of them by name
7652480	7660880	just because I've seen a lot of their videos outside of GDQ, but, um, yeah, I don't remember
7660880	7667520	a lot of them, but if I followed it more, which I'm bad about doing, um, then yes, it might be
7667520	7672640	something I would. Yeah. But the point is, is that, you know, you have a lot of really,
7672640	7676400	really great game players that participate in those types of charity events and so forth. And
7676400	7681040	it's just, it's just different now because you know, in the, in back in the day, we didn't get
7681120	7686000	our news instantly from Twitch and the internet and so forth. You had your gaming magazine. So
7686000	7690960	a part of the gaming magazine was trying to build up this cult of gaming celebrities and the
7690960	7695680	squeakiest wheel who is doing it the most efficiently was Walter Day and the organization
7695680	7700800	behind Twin Galaxies. And, you know, I don't think that should necessarily be discounted, but, um,
7700800	7705520	you know, was it really accurately measuring who really was the best in the whole world?
7705520	7709680	Probably not as well as we can look at that sort of things today, because it's much easier for
7709680	7715120	anybody to be able to broadcast, but you know, it existed. It was a thing. Maybe gaming wouldn't be
7715120	7721280	in the same place it was today without it. But the reality is if you don't evolve, you will fade
7721280	7726000	away. And so if Twin Galaxies hasn't really evolved and honestly, I haven't really kept up
7726000	7731760	with them, but I think, I think they are more like a celebration of, of classic games and kind of
7731760	7735920	like a classic gaming corner. I think last I checked in on them, it was that type of thing.
7735920	7740320	Um, you know, or even take us here at Orange Launch Radio, we've been doing this show
7740320	7745760	way too fucking long. Like we're coming up on 18 years of this program and we've only been on
7745760	7751840	Twitch for maybe the past year. And in retrospect, we should have done it way fucking sooner.
7751840	7758800	Well, we did though. And this, this is the other problem. Sometimes you evolve too soon and you
7758800	7764000	don't really see the benefits of it because, uh, we were on Justin TV for a short time, but then
7764000	7767600	it was like, this doesn't seem to be at, nobody's really into this. What are we doing? Whatever.
7767600	7772320	We're going to get rid of it. And so we went back to the Google stadia. Yeah, we did. We did. And
7772320	7776080	we were, you know, on shout cast for many years and, you know, it's continued to do the podcast
7776080	7780720	and all that, but now that we're on Twitch and so forth, I think we've been able to expand our
7780720	7784400	audience a little bit within the last year. And now I'm kind of kicking myself going, we should
7784400	7790560	have fucking done this three years ago, you know, but it, it didn't work out, but you know, we
7790560	7794720	evolved too. I'm not trying to compare ourselves to twin galaxies, but I guess I just did.
7798400	7803920	Anyway. So I've been talking an awful lot. Um, so what, let me ask, let me ask about your thoughts
7803920	7810080	on this whole thing. So you recently saw the documentary. What's your take on this culture?
7810080	7815600	Do you think that these guys have been lying to try to stay relevant or what's your take on all
7815600	7822560	this? Well, I think, yeah, one really important part is that, you know, Billy Mitchell, his brand
7822560	7826320	is, you know, part of his brand was, you know, that he was the record holder and, you know,
7826320	7832800	he sells hot sauce, uh, for a living. So I think a big part of that, you know, part of his livelihood,
7832800	7838720	I think was centered around that. And, and, uh, there was, I had also mentioned in the chat,
7838720	7844480	there was that also kind of the other side, uh, um, it came, I think it also came out in 2007 was
7844480	7849360	chasing ghosts. So I thought it was a really interesting juxtaposition of the two kind of
7849360	7853760	positions of one guy trying to like break into that and all the stuff he ran into. And then
7853760	7858880	the other one seemed to be just more of a documentary on their lives. And, you know,
7858880	7864720	a lot of what came out of it was for me, at least was that you had all this urban legend growing up,
7864720	7869280	like you heard about Billy Mitchell because the internet never really, really knew what that
7869280	7875440	meant. And, you know, so to hear the whole story now, um, I don't know, I just, I think it just
7875440	7881280	kind of made him seem more human and just like all of us. And that's why it kind of, that kind
7881280	7886000	of dawned on me that all these guys were just, you know, they had their egos that, you know,
7886000	7890880	cause they were amazing back then, a lot of them, and then just the, you know, the thought that you
7890880	7896720	could hold onto that record forever. I think it was, it's interesting. Cause I think back then
7896720	7900560	you could, you know, or you could, at least it'd be really hard, but with the internet,
7901120	7906560	you're always competing against someone. Um, like for instance, I was looking at the super Mario,
7906560	7911920	uh, like the original Mario, uh, speed record and every, it seems like every week or every
7911920	7918640	day they shave off point of a second or whatever that is. And it's just unachievable. So I just
7918640	7924640	think it's a crazy cross section of culture of this idea of trying to be the best. And maybe
7924640	7930480	it's just not, you know, maybe it's not as glorious as it once was in the eighties because
7930480	7935280	now you're literally talking about people that are going to be taking six months of their lives
7935280	7939120	to just try to shave off these few millisecond to be at a world record.
7940320	7944320	No, very good point. Um, you know, and I'm, I'm kind of also thinking about, you know,
7944320	7947840	somewhat of the culture of the eighties and sometimes, sometimes kind of like,
7947840	7952560	it takes a little bit of luck as well to sometimes be the one that's picked to be famous. And what I
7952560	7956560	mean by that is like, if I were to use like an equivalent from the eighties, since we're talking
7956560	7960000	about, you know, the twin galaxies and, you know, when all these records were going on,
7960000	7964160	let's talk about like when MTV kind of first came out and started making all these musicians famous,
7964160	7969360	let's take somebody like Madonna. Madonna was like the queen of MTV for a long time and some
7969360	7975040	would argue still is, but Madonna, let's be real. Madonna is not the best singer, right?
7975040	7980000	But Madonna kind of knows how to play up the cameras and Madonna is kind of a great performer
7980080	7984400	and Madonna knew how to play that role, especially in the eighties. I'm not really commenting on her
7984400	7989600	now. You know, she'd been around forever, but Madonna in the eighties was great at being a
7989600	7994640	celebrity. So in some ways, Billy Mitchell in a way embodies a lot of that as well.
7994640	7998960	Billy Mitchell may not be the best, but Billy Mitchell embodied being a celebrity and kind of
7998960	8004960	continues to do that in a way very well. Although as many people would say, Madonna kind of peaked
8004960	8009040	a few years ago and it's been an interesting declines. I think a lot of folks would probably
8009040	8013360	say the same thing about Billy Mitchell and so forth, but it's, it is very interesting.
8013360	8018880	And even with music, you know, now a lot of people get music, they find people on YouTube.
8018880	8022880	You know, it's like, that's how Justin Bieber got found, right? You know, and I realize a lot of
8022880	8027040	people make fun of him and so forth, but the reality is he has a record contract and you don't.
8027040	8030800	How did they find him? They found him through things like YouTube. And now it's all these
8030800	8035120	reality shows, finding fucking people online and putting them front and center and so forth. So
8035120	8041840	it's just very interesting how, you know, a lot of that has just evolved and what makes a celebrity
8041840	8048000	is very much changed. I want to read a comment here from Questbuster in our chat at twitch.tv
8048000	8052560	slash vlog network, who says it's crazy how Mitchell and the retro scene blew up in the last
8052560	8057440	few years. And so quickly, partially because of how accessible social media has made everything
8057440	8064400	a 24 seven news cycle with a faster news cycle to stars can rise and fall almost as fast back in the
8064400	8069680	80s and 90s. We just had magazines to tell us who the stars were, and they had 30 day reprieves
8069680	8074400	until the next issue to see if they still retain their thrones. That's an excellent point. I think
8074400	8078560	that's a good one to probably wrap up on. Any other thoughts, Rob, before we let you go?
8080000	8085520	And actually the last thing, just you just reminded me of something. Is it even possible
8085520	8089600	that he is great, you know, benefiting from all this attention now? Because he has a, I think
8089600	8095200	someone was mentioning, he's got a Twitch channel now. And so could this all be like, isn't that
8095200	8100080	what they say? Like any controversy is good when you're at that level almost because now people
8100080	8103360	are talking about even the fact that we're talking maybe is a good thing. I don't know.
8103920	8108240	Absolutely. And I would bet you this, like, I'm not going to claim that this show has some gigantic
8108240	8112880	viewership or listenership, but I'll bet you there'll be one person who listened to this,
8112880	8116960	who go, Oh yeah, Billy Mitchell had a Twitch. I wonder what he's doing over there right now.
8117040	8121920	And he'll go visit it. And I think it just goes to show, even if they're talking bad about you,
8121920	8125440	they're talking about you and it's going to cause that curiosity. Or somebody is going to go look up
8125440	8130000	the article on Wikipedia or somebody is going to see if he has a Twitter or something like that,
8130000	8134240	because you're kind of bringing his name out there and people are going to be curious a little bit
8134240	8138480	about, you know, what's he up to now? And that's just, that's just the interesting part about how
8138480	8143520	this all works. So absolutely. Why do you think he has kind of an on-off switch in his brain a
8143520	8147840	little bit where, you know, again, and as I mentioned, I'm telling you, he's a pretty nice guy
8147840	8152880	off camera. But the minute the camera goes on, he's in, he's in camera mode and he knows the
8152880	8158800	part he has to play to get you to keep being curious about him. Yep. That makes sense. Yeah.
8158800	8163040	Well, thank you very much for answering all my questions and yeah, it's been great talking to
8163040	8167520	you. I've been a listener for about 15 years in the background since my iPod mini, I think,
8167520	8172480	is when I first downloaded it. So it's, yeah, it's nice to finally call in and yeah, talk to
8172480	8176800	you for once. Well, wonderful to have you here. Thank you so much for your loyalty over the years
8176800	8182320	and I wish you well. Have a wonderful night. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Yep. Take care. Bye-bye.
8182960	8186880	All right. Great phone call. Wow. That was a long time phone call in the making too. Yeah. And see,
8186880	8192480	that's, that's where we're succeeding tonight is places like Canada where the, they don't have
8192480	8195920	teams in the Super Bowl or there's no Canadian football. Well, I mean, I know there's Canadian
8195920	8200080	football league, but there's no Canadian football teams in the NFL, right? You're asking the wrong
8200080	8204960	person, right? I don't think there are. I think I would know if there was like a Vancouver team or
8204960	8211200	a Toronto team and I don't think there are. So, all right. Anyway, cool. You know, I thought he
8211200	8214960	was going to say when I've been listening for 15 years, I started on my PSP. You know how many of
8214960	8220160	that I get that OLR PSP thing probably brought more. I always thought it was iTunes that brought
8220160	8224080	the eyes to the show. And that one life, I think all our PSP probably brought more people to show
8224080	8229360	than anybody else. That's crazy. So, well, it's too late now. Yeah. I'll never update it. All right.
8230560	8233760	Well, that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio. Cause I don't think you
8233760	8240080	didn't have any other last minute stories, right? No, not really. Then we'll go on to wrap things
8240080	8244400	up. We're going to wrap things up here at orange launch radio. Thank you guys so much for listening
8244400	8248160	in tonight, whether it was your first episode or you've been listening for 15 years, appreciate
8248160	8252240	you being here either live or in the podcast form. If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange
8252240	8255680	launch radio, tell a friend, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer
8255680	8260560	has a voice. But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then we can't have them. And we love
8260560	8265360	to hear the interesting and diverse perspectives. So yeah, help us spread the word. A nice five star
8265360	8269200	review goes a long way as well. iTunes, or I guess you can't really review things on Spotify,
8269200	8274400	but you can share. So there is that. So I really appreciate that and all that support. We'll be
8274400	8280320	back in seven days to do it all over again. I keep thinking next weekend is Valentine's weekend,
8280320	8284480	but it's not. We still have one more weekend in between. So, but for now we're going to wrap
8284480	8288240	up for the night and go around and give everybody's final thoughts. So, Loki, your final
8288240	8295920	thought. My final thought is I can't wait to be over this cold. Oh, yikes. Feel better. I hope
8295920	8301280	you didn't give it to me. No, I got it from my wife. It was, it was like almost like a flu thing,
8301280	8306640	but I'm going through it a lot faster than she is. You sound fine too. I'm just congested. Like,
8307120	8314240	I mean, I was fine today. And my final thought is I did my tax return last night and I'm getting way
8314240	8319360	less money back than I have in previous years, which makes me a little bit sad, but oh well.
8320400	8324480	That is what it is. So I hope I will cross my fingers and my toes that you all get,
8324480	8327760	at least those of you in America that have to do your taxes this time of year. I will cross
8327760	8332080	my fingers and my toes that you all get some good news as well. Anyway, or at least better
8332080	8337520	news than I did. That's it. We're done. Enjoy gaming everybody. We'll see you in seven days.
8337520	8341760	Have fun playing games and all that good stuff. Be nice to each other and support independent
8341760	8347760	broadcasting. We will see you in seven days. Good night everybody. You've been listening to
