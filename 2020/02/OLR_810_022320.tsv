7000	14000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	This week I got to play 2DX Heroverse on a lightning cabinet and it was amazing, there's a headphone jack!
19000	22000	2DX is now up to date with every other active Imani game cabinet
22000	28000	This is the week's updated music gaming, join us for more details on the rest of the news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 810 for this February the 23rd of 2020
45000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts and yes we're back and we've even gotten our music game update there at the top of the show
51000	53000	Thank you voice over guy Jason
53000	57000	And joining me live in the studio of course DarkSakura who's showing off her food tonight
57000	60000	I went to the broccoli farm, there's some broccoli
60000	65000	There you go, live on our Twitch channel because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network
65000	72000	Twitch.tv slash VOG network or VOG network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
72000	79000	Except oops we weren't here last week, sorry about that, reality is I had strep throat, it's as simple as that
79000	86000	So when this show was going on last week or should have been going on last week I was getting tested for strep and getting an antibiotic
86000	91000	And obviously that's a very highly contagious thing and y'all know that we tape this show in one of the rooms at my house
91000	98000	So it would have been a very silly idea to have Jamie and of course Techmaster Loki who also sits here with me every week being exposed to that
98000	99000	I would not like that
99000	106000	Yeah that would not be fun so and I know that's really unfortunate because I've been talking for a couple weeks about how we're not gonna be here the next two weeks
106000	111000	Oops because I'm gonna be on a cruise, you know I feel a little less bad about that though cause hello cruise
111000	118000	But it is what it is, so essentially this is the only live show you're getting for a whole month, yikes I'm so sorry guys
118000	126000	But we do appreciate all you guys that do turn up here every week and I will say this, we are looking at doing a show during the week next week
126000	128000	I forgot to ask you before, are you free?
128000	129000	Yeah I should use yours
130000	137000	Yes we're gonna tape something next week so that at least there will be something on the podcast feed and there will be something here to play
137000	141000	After Bobby Blackwolf on that would be March 1st if I did my math right
141000	148000	So we'll have something there that night but then March 8th because I will still be, it's a 7 day cruise, I'll still be out at sea
148000	152000	And we won't have had time to do something in advance so that will just be a dark week for the show
153000	160000	So I really appreciate you guys but you know most shows that are, like you have to wait like a year and a half for a new season of Stranger Things
160000	169000	Okay and so I'm going on a Star Trek cruise, we're season 3 of Discovery, it takes a little while so we do our best but real life gets in the way sometimes
169000	174000	Sometimes it's because of sick, sometimes it's because of fun so there it is
175000	180000	But yeah thank you guys for being here live tonight and joining us back here as we are live over at Twitch
180000	185000	Or if you're on our podcast feed, however you are checking out the show
185000	190000	I do want to get into our kickoff topic here and talk about some of the things that we missed in the last week
190000	196000	But one, Loki I want to kind of pick on you first because one of the things we did miss by not having a show last week was
196000	201000	Kind of the big headlines about how well the Sonic the Hedgehog movies were performing
201000	207000	It was number one at the box office obviously but I believe they said it made more than Detective Pikachu
207000	208000	Yes
208000	213000	It's doing very well for a video game movie, I didn't check out how the second weekend went but I imagine
213000	214000	Good
214000	220000	Good I mean good for them so it's interesting because it really shows like wow them going back to the drawing board to fix it
220000	225000	And maybe kicking it back to a time when there wasn't a lot of competition Valentine's Day weekend
225000	230000	Like I think there was a romance movie out somewhere but those are going to be very different crowds, your family movie and your romance movie
230000	234000	Yeah there was like horror movies and I don't remember what else came out
234000	239000	So you know you didn't really have like a Pixar film out or a Disney film out like those are coming out
239000	246000	Well Pixar actually that came out, I want to say that came out this week
246000	248000	Maybe it's next week I don't know
248000	254000	But regardless of all that the Sonic movie has been doing very well but as I mentioned I was very sick
254000	257000	So there was no way I was going to go to a movie theater and see that
257000	262000	Dar Sacher and I were supposed to have a date but for obvious reasons that didn't happen so we didn't get to go to the theater to see that
262000	264000	But Loki I understood you went, you took the kids right?
264000	265000	Yes
265000	267000	So how was it?
267000	269000	It was great, I loved it
269000	282000	It was a great Sonic movie like it's not, it wasn't terrible in the sense that you would think that like the human characters would be annoying and stuff
282000	291000	I love Jim Carrey so I think they opened it up at the end for like you know what a sequel would be like and it's very exciting
291000	296000	And it seems like almost a definite with how well it did to the box office and the sequel will happen
296000	303000	And it's like listen we know what you guys want we're going to deliver with that and you know
303000	310000	I could guess what it is without having seen the movie like I don't know but like I'm almost positive I know
310000	316000	And all I'm going to say is what was the new thing in Sonic 2 versus Sonic 1 am I right?
316000	318000	Yeah I thought, I think so
318000	321000	Split screen multiplayer that is what is coming in the next movie anyway
321000	328000	But no they had like some funny like stuff like it's very aware of you know everything they did you know
328000	332000	He eats chili dogs like he does in the cartoon series
332000	337000	They had a picture this crazy old man who's seen him they called him like crazy I forget his name
337000	343000	But like he drew a picture of what Sonic looked like he's like it's the blue devil and he has hold of a picture of Sanic
343000	347000	Okay so there are like meme references
347000	350000	Thank you for ruining all the good jokes in the movie no I'm kidding
350000	354000	But well okay let me address that one criticism because you know I've been watching Twitter
354000	358000	And the one criticism I have seen about the movie although most people I know kind of tend to overly enjoy it
359000	366000	Although maybe I hear it's really more for kids and it doesn't really have like Detective Pikachu kind of had those balls that were lobbed at adults
366000	369000	That only adults would get but Sonic doesn't really have those
369000	374000	But the other thing is that the other big criticism I'm hearing is that all the good stuff was already given away in the trailers
374000	376000	A lot of it was in the trailers yeah
376000	379000	Yeah but that's kind of normal for a lot of movies right
379000	383000	But it's fine you know some of it it's still okay I think
383000	386000	It was still a decent movie
386000	391000	Well I hope to see it I mean the reality is with everything else I've had going on I don't know when I'll get to it
391000	395000	But I'll go see it why not you know I enjoyed Detective Pikachu
395000	401000	The video game movies have been on a roll lately so and I think the redesign of Sonic was done really well
401000	406000	And you know if you're going to be out there complaining on the internet and they actually listen to you
406000	410000	Then maybe you should go throw them some coin by going to pay to see the movie
410000	415000	Yeah I think so I mean and what I like about like even like they had
415000	422000	Because you know Sega doesn't really make movies so they had to come up with their own sort of like logo thing to you know for like
422000	428000	It's a Sega movie you know but it was like so they had all the classic like 16-bit stuff and they're like oh yeah
428000	432000	Okay that's what please tell me they had the voice Sega please tell me that voice was there
432000	435000	Something like that yeah okay but it was alright
435000	439000	That's fine I don't we've given enough away I don't want to ruin the movie for people who haven't seen it yet
439000	447000	But like myself you know there's some other fun stuff they did the trailer sequence which was all 16-bit
447000	452000	Looked like the you know the Sonic game but it was all scenes from the movie I'm like ooh I want a game like that
452000	454000	That'd be pretty cool
454000	460000	Quick Jim Carrey though you're a huge Jim Carrey fan you have people may not know Loki is not a reference to the Marvel Universe
460000	465000	Loki your name comes from the mask in that universe so that's where you kind of named yourself from
465000	469000	Because you've been a Jim Carrey fan for forever so this is like his first big movie in in a few years
469000	478000	Yes it's a great like I'm back bitches was it kind of it's just you know it's classic Jim Carrey's so you know I think it's it was pretty good
478000	489000	Okay I and you know like he definitely is a different take on Dr. Robotnik but like at the end you know he definitely starts looking like the character
489000	493000	And like I could totally see him as you know it's it's perfectly fine now
493000	499000	Interesting do you think that he's gonna do more movies now like now that that's he's kind of got his foot back in the door that's interesting
499000	500000	I hope so
500000	501000	Yeah I hope so too
501000	507000	Going to our chat because again we do tape live over at Twitch TV slash vog network VOG network every Sunday night
507000	515000	Bonds 006 is in chat saying the film was freaking awesome and Tiger Claw says Jim Carrey has said he had a lot of fun doing this movie and wants to do more of them
515000	521000	So I mean I don't think there is is there any other villain in the Sonic Universe besides Dr. Robotnik I mean he kind of has to come back
521000	528000	They were actually originally thank god they didn't do it they're originally planning on a different villain like I don't even know what it was
528000	536000	But then they also have like this other character that they came up with that is supposedly like Sonic's caretaker or something like that and that was kind of weird
536000	541000	Like I don't remember this character anywhere any but whatever it's fine
541000	545000	I never read the Archie comics or watched the animated one
545000	553000	Oh Phoenix 7726 says Shadow the Hedgehog I guess that that could maybe be a direction they go in the sequel who knows good good call out
553000	560000	But SH-100 Matt and I agree with this comment here in chat says they released it at the right time and I think that's very true
560000	561000	Chaos
561000	569000	Oh yeah chaos okay but anyway I think even though it was kind of a shit show when it first showed up in the early CG and everything
569000	574000	I actually think them pushing it back to February kind of really ended up working in the favor
574000	579000	I think the time you release a movie and what it goes up against is everything
579000	587000	You know what's funny though is and I saw an article today about it is unfortunately the toys were made a little earlier
587000	589000	Oh so the toys look like old Sonic
589000	590000	I saw that too
590000	592000	Uh oh oh wow what can you do
592000	593000	Eh wah wah
593000	594000	Wah wah
594000	595000	That's fine
595000	601000	Alright okay well I just I had to get your thoughts on that I know Tigerclaw like has been waiting for like three weeks to hear
601000	609000	Uh and unfortunately again I think y'all can give me an excuse on why I didn't see it and and Dark Sakura was to be my date so that's why she didn't see it either
609000	612000	But I noticed that Loki had seen it I had to get your take on the Sonic movies
612000	617000	And then I liked the you know I wish that because Junkie XL did the soundtrack for the movie and so like I was
617000	619000	But yeah music's important how was that
619000	626000	That was good like but I wish there was more music from the game in the movie they did like kind of a piano cover of the Green Hill Zone
626000	628000	Um at one point
628000	630000	Which is like some of my favorite music ever
630000	635000	Towards the end and that was good but like throughout the movie it just didn't really feel like more Sonic music
635000	639000	But I don't know um there's lots of potential
639000	641000	Okay cool alright so Sonic movie yay
641000	645000	Alright well let's move on I want to talk about before we get into like our gaming weeks and this week's news
645000	652000	Let's talk a little bit about the big headlines we missed last week because I do feel like unfortunately you know the news cycle is what it is
652000	657000	And I think we had a lot of big headlines last week and I think the headlines this week are only kind of big
657000	662000	But we had some big things that happened last week so let's talk about some of the news that we missed last week
662000	668000	So I would say by far the biggest headline that was dropped last week that we didn't really get to address was
668000	671000	Um Jeff Keighley piecing out at E3 2020
671000	676000	That was like that was a um when I read that on Twitter that was a literal jaw drop
676000	678000	I was like wow
678000	681000	So he has basically voiced that he's not going to E3 2020
681000	685000	He's not going to be producing um his carnival sideshow
685000	689000	And I'm being very bad with my description
689000	691000	But he's not going to be doing that sideshow at E3 this time
691000	695000	So um yeah what's what's what's going on
695000	700000	Like that's that's really bad for E3 in my opinion to see Jeff Keighley kind of saying pieces do yeah
700000	702000	And then I want to say like I don't remember the details
702000	708000	But he had like um like people were asking him questions on Twitter about it
708000	713000	And he was just talking about like he didn't like the direction that the show was going or something like that
713000	718000	So there was like without actually calling out what the exact reason was he kind of hinted at some things
718000	722000	But I don't know what that exactly means
722000	731000	I guess we'll have to see but it's not a good sign when you have a lot of people that were kind of helping bring interest to it dropping out of it
731000	736000	Let me ask a very simple question and I open this up to our chatters as well
736000	739000	They're watching live tonight on Twitch
739000	745000	If you had the power to realistically make changes at E3 and I'm saying realistically okay
745000	748000	Don't you know try to try to temper your your budget ideas
748000	755000	What can the ESA what can E3 do at this point to kind of save itself because I think there's a lot of us going yikes
755000	757000	This is really not looking good
757000	765000	I mean essentially we're headed towards this is going to be the Microsoft conference with the Nintendo Sideshow
765000	770000	You know going on this year and I only put and I know some may take issue with me calling Nintendo a sideshow
770000	774000	I'm only relegating them to that status because Microsoft has the new console
775000	781000	Therefore they're gonna have plenty of new games this year and Nintendo has already said no new hardware for 2020
781000	785000	So that is why I've said that so if you're a Nintendo fan just please deal with that for a minute
785000	792000	But as far as you know E3 what do you think can be done at this point? What does the ESA need to do to shift course on this?
792000	797000	They need to give Paris Hilton a call so she can come back with her new cell phone
797000	799000	John Cena needs to come back
800000	805000	No, I don't I don't think so, I don't really know if there's anything they can do it's just I think
808000	812000	It's not I mean, yeah sort it's it's not really I think the problem
812000	817000	It has an identity crisis with it doesn't know what exactly it's trying to be. And so that's the problem
817000	822000	It's not good at any of the things it's trying to because it's supposed to be like an industry gathering that
823000	828000	That's when you you know, you work with your retailers about like what your product plans are gonna be and like
828000	832000	You know get them excited about stuff that's coming out and you at the same time
832000	834000	You know consumers are learning about things as well
834000	841000	But it was mainly a concern, you know an industry show a trade show and now it's like well now
841000	845840	it's a you know, what's a show for fans to come but then like I
846600	849500	Don't know. It's like well, then how are they gonna get stuff done now?
849500	853120	and it's just and then you have all these companies dropping out and I
854040	856320	Mean, I guess you could highlight Indies more
857240	860960	That's funny because a lot of chatters are echoing that and I want to get to that in just a minute
860960	864940	That's like packs. I mean before I get to that. I think I think you're right on the money. Is that
866200	870080	Pax is having a crisis e3 is having a major identity crisis
870080	873280	And I think the first thing they need to figure out is what are we?
873520	878640	What because we've tried we're not we've now been trying to put our fingers in every pie because we're having an identity crisis
878640	881880	You know, do we need to let the public in do we not are we only for the media?
881880	885860	Are we not like what I think the first thing III needs to figure out is what are we?
886440	887320	Stick to it
887320	892960	even if it's gonna maybe piss some of the fans off because the fans will still always have that unless e3 decides we want to
892960	899000	Be a competition with packs then go all-in on that, you know with with some of these other suggestions about like Indies and so forth
899000	901480	Yeah, then if you're gonna do like the packs route then, you know
901480	906720	you need to get like start having some keynotes or more you already kind of do keynotes, but like have like
907600	913080	Discussion tracks that you can go to and like, you know talk to developers and you'll kind of like GDC or something
913080	915780	Literally be packs. I mean that's kind of our yeah
916960	918960	I don't know. It's just I
919360	924900	Like all the news being around one little area and I like that. It's an exciting time of the year
924900	928000	I understand that. Yeah, it sucks you with everything
929240	932400	it's not very convenient for people to go and see stuff and
932920	937720	you know other companies are figuring out that they can do have more coverage with
938520	942080	having their events at different times and like separate from everything but
943080	948560	I still like the old way, you know with everything being there, but yeah, I get it. I understand
948560	952640	Um, I want to read some of these comments in chat because I think there's a really good idea here
952640	954540	I want to laser focus on a little bit
954540	960160	Some of the comments in chat was SSJ 100 Matt says cancel e3 for a few years and restructure
960440	963560	Make it more indie friendly is one of the things I can think of
963840	969120	Barbie Britney 84 in our chat says I think they need to pivot this into an indie showcase this year
969120	972200	But it used to have an indie showcase but it was called Kensha Hall
972200	972600	That's right
972600	978800	The problem with it being an indie showcase is indie showcase doesn't pay the bills for that location or anything else
978800	983760	So that's why what they need to do is figure out how to like get these other companies that are leaving
984000	989720	You know make it worth their while but I don't think that they're gonna figure that out and then just got fall apart
989720	996640	I kind of respectfully do think that indie is the answer. That's what I would go everybody else does it better though?
996640	999760	I get the whole you've got to be able to pay the bills and so forth
999760	1000680	There's got to be that balance
1000680	1006320	But let me let me let me take a step back as to why why did I get sick at you three?
1006320	1008680	Why did I stop going to e3 like, you know?
1008680	1011720	Let's let's just analyze that for a minute cuz that that's something I can take a look at and go
1011720	1017880	Why did I stop going to e3 because everybody is saying well your media even though e3 says your media?
1017880	1020120	You're not you're not good enough media for us
1020120	1021640	That is a huge part of it
1021640	1027660	And even when I would finally justify myself to get into a conference to get into an interview to get into whatever
1027660	1034120	I was seeing the same shit that was on YouTube later that evening or like I will the thing that like if I could put
1034120	1036720	My finger on like one instance that broke e3 for me
1036800	1043120	It was when I waited at Ubisoft and I had to sit there and justify
1043740	1048700	Why I was even at e3 to this person at Ubisoft and this whole like, you know
1048700	1054260	What the podcast is and all that stuff to go in to see this Assassin's Creed thing, which isn't even a series
1054260	1057180	I'm like usually super into but like get me excited about it, right?
1057220	1061620	So finally I go in I see the thing and then later that night. It's all there on YouTube
1061620	1065140	So it's like why did I fight with this person?
1065260	1071060	To try to get into this screening when it's like it's not even that secret what it's not even a big deal
1071060	1073060	What you're showing you're putting it out there for everybody
1073140	1077580	like that was like the moment when I was like man III this is this show is getting ridiculous and
1077900	1083340	I love Kensha Hall. That was great. Let's be real. Kensha Hall was closed ten years
1083340	1084300	I understand time
1084300	1088140	but I think there is something about bringing that back and my point is a
1088300	1094860	Lot of like the interviews a lot of the things you would see at e3 over the years have been we're sticking to a script
1094860	1096860	We're sick sticking to the same old line
1096900	1102920	We have the do you remember when vog network for those who have been here for a little while would do those?
1103240	1107680	Go ask the we're gonna go chase down the answers to your questions
1107680	1110360	Like it was honestly like not to toot my own horn
1110360	1112280	But because Bobby was a big part of this too
1112280	1117240	But the idea in its concept was brilliant and the first year it worked pretty well the second year
1117240	1124000	It didn't work and Bobby almost got thrown out of Nintendo's booth because he was asking these questions that were like off script
1124160	1126160	for the the the
1126320	1131360	People that were hired to answer the questions and they were like essentially he could tell you more about this and I'm sure he already
1131360	1136120	Isn't chat, but they were essentially like sir. You need to stop asking so many questions, basically, and I think I'm sorry
1136120	1138120	That's that is you need to stop asking questions
1138800	1142400	Sir, we're gonna have to we don't like the tone of your inquisition
1142880	1146400	So my point he can tell the story better than I can but my point is
1146960	1153400	You know who is gonna be ready to answer questions, you know who wants to talk about gaming, you know who loves gaming
1153400	1155960	You know who can bring that excitement back to e3?
1156440	1163480	Indies and that is why I totally agree that Indy is the path to try to get e3 to be fun
1163480	1167480	again is they get the people there who want to talk about their games and
1167920	1172120	Love to answer stupid questions because people are talking about their game
1172120	1175720	That's that's the fun and excitement e3 needs again
1175720	1180500	And if Sony doesn't want to be that developer then you can quote me on this
1180660	1182460	Mm-hmm
1182460	1186780	Fuck them get some Indies in there who will talk about their stuff
1186780	1192980	I bet there's lots of great indie developers making stuff on Sony's platform that will talk about their game
1192980	1197220	That's why I like going to the GDC after parties. I don't go to GDC. I go to parties
1197740	1199620	Exactly meet people who love what they do
1199620	1207540	yeah, exactly for the last couple years how much time during Sony's press conferences were dedicated to the last of us and
1208060	1209380	games like that
1209380	1215220	Versus dreams that just came out which has literally no fanfare to it at all
1215220	1223200	But is such an amazing thing that nobody is talking about and it will die a quiet death because nobody is talking about it
1224060	1229720	Bobby black wolf is telling the story here. It is. Yes. It was Mario maker. They actually didn't like my tone
1229720	1233520	I was asking questions and they said sorry, you're not recognized media
1233520	1236820	You can play the demo but do not ask our booth attendants any questions
1236900	1242220	The person managing that little area told me it was probably best if I walked away after my demo
1243380	1245380	Wow, I mean
1245620	1251140	Okay, if you want to talk about why e3 fucking sucks as it is right now
1252820	1254980	Where's where's that Will Smith picture?
1257860	1261660	There it is like print it put it on the back of the box that is it
1262380	1264380	So that attitude?
1265060	1268200	Needs to change if e3 is gonna be successful again
1268660	1274940	Get excited about your fucking games get people that want to talk about games make gaming fun again
1275540	1277540	It's just that simple
1278560	1280560	Anyway
1281100	1284560	What other stories do we miss last week how was one of medley many headlines
1286140	1288140	Let's see, so what else
1288900	1290900	What there's a bit about?
1291020	1297300	WWE 2k 20 right apparently didn't sell didn't sell well and there's there's yeah about that right? It's sold poorly
1297900	1300980	Apparently well, I mean it was a broken ass game
1301580	1303100	so
1303100	1309220	There's that when people hear that your game is broken as shit. They probably aren't too likely to buy it. I
1311820	1314260	Don't know works they're disappointed that
1315140	1319980	WWE 2k 20 did not meet our expectations both in terms of sale and quality quality
1320680	1326420	You don't say you fucking knew what state it was in when you release the shit, so don't give me this
1326420	1329860	Yeah, we we're so caught off guard. Oh my god
1330380	1332060	like I
1332060	1334980	Just they knew what the fuck they're doing oops
1335580	1342840	Let's see another big story from last week February 19th. We had some new updates for the switch online service
1342840	1348680	So the classic emulation service including pop and Twinbee, so maybe something up dark soccer is how did you not know?
1348680	1351680	That's on switch now. Yes, the dark soccer just lit up like what?
1352840	1356800	So pop and Twinbee is there? Yeah, it must be it must be
1357920	1359440	peel-peel
1359440	1364480	Sega Aegis is coming out. Oh on this way. That's right. Well, there's a lot of Sega Aegis stuff already on switch
1364480	1365960	They've got a lot of good stuff
1365960	1367960	Smash tennis also was released
1368320	1372240	Eliminator boat duel and shadow of the ninja which actually that one
1372520	1375720	Shadow of the ninja is one of those games like you probably haven't heard of it
1375760	1381520	But you should go check it out because it was like one of those like 8-bit like classics that like it was a hipster game
1381520	1386520	Like not a lot you probably never played this but like it's really good. So it's it's worth checking out
1386520	1393240	So there's there's some decent little like gems in there, but we're still not seeing the huge hitters, you know
1393840	1395840	But we'll see we'll see how much they can
1396400	1402080	Continue to add on to that and then I guess one more here. I think this is a huge story from last week
1402640	1405880	Bubble bobble for friends. That's right bubble bobble for
1406360	1411620	Got listed by Amazon for a North American release coming up this next week on March 4th
1411640	1416780	So, I don't know if that has officially been announced since then or what have you but it looks like we may have a new
1416780	1418780	Bubble bobble gaming coming and that's a lot of fun, right?
1419300	1424100	So, yep, all right, so there you go anything else from last week, I don't think we need to really say anything else
1424100	1428380	Yeah, let's get into how was your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been playing this week
1428380	1432940	And then we'll get into this week's headlines. So dark soccer. I'll start with you. How was your gaming week?
1433060	1436220	It involves some of the Kunio things
1436220	1442400	I didn't exactly play it but because Dan and Jeffrey were playing a crapload of it
1443060	1446860	It also involved trying to teach Julian how to play ghouls and ghosts
1447700	1448980	Which
1448980	1455940	The Genesis mini it's got some emulation issues and timing response problems. So when Dan went to go play again on
1456660	1463060	The CDX on a legit cart. He had no problems beating the game this morning. So
1463900	1468660	but yeah, we introduced the boy to that and we introduced him to Streets of Rage 2 as
1469540	1476340	You should and the joy that is a soundtrack by Yuzo. I was just about to say and hopefully you have burned him a CD
1476860	1480740	The soundtrack or whatever what whatever we did on Spotify. What are the kids do today?
1480740	1481260	I don't know
1481260	1486620	We did also show him the bare-knuckle arcade machines that were in there and told him yeah
1486620	1490500	That was the original name of the first one was bare knuckles. This is bare knuckle, too
1490500	1492640	So you got posters with had bk2 on it
1493260	1495260	And he thought that was pretty cool
1495580	1496500	and
1496500	1500880	Then you know, usually it's just this week has been my phone stuff. I
1501660	1502880	started
1502880	1507040	Installing some more mods for Sims and then I was like, yeah, I kind of don't feel like it just because
1507520	1509520	I had a four-day weekend
1510200	1511360	and
1511360	1517640	I don't get those and so I went outside and played reality for a little while. I
1518560	1519960	It's not a new camera
1519960	1526240	I mean, I know I've told everyone Dan's mom died, but Dan came home with something for me from her possessions, which is a
1526800	1532440	1977 Minolta Heimatic camera Oh fun. It's a rangefinder, you know click wind all that
1532520	1537320	And I was like, so I decided to take it out and kind of do a little tribute
1537320	1540000	Did you end up doing the Pokemon go community day yesterday?
1540000	1542000	Cuz I imagine you asked me to do that, but I had family
1542480	1548400	No, we didn't really do the community day stuff cuz Becky wanted to come to and Julian was with us
1548400	1552440	he promised not to complain about anything, but he complained anyway, and then got hangry and
1553440	1557400	then but I showed him where the arcade was in stage 9 and
1558000	1558840	And
1558840	1564440	There was a dude playing punch-out and Julian was like, you know kind of that was cool. He's cool kid
1564440	1568080	He wants come back on the show. So I said when we're back, how old is he like 12 now, right?
1568080	1574640	He's gonna be 13 in April. Wow. He's that age. I can't call him. Mr. Boy anymore. He is now young sir. Yeah
1576240	1579720	So, I don't know when he is not so young of a sir anymore
1579720	1584760	But that he can be young sir for the or I might call him a teenage menace. I don't know. All right
1584760	1587140	Well, yeah, we'll definitely have to get him back on the show at some point. That'll be fun
1587640	1593840	But at any rate, you know, it's just my usual phony stuff and I'm still playing
1594480	1601600	Patterned on my Mac a lot of patterned. I love that game. Cool. All right. Well, if that's it for dark Sakura
1601600	1607500	Let's go over to Loki. How was your gaming week? So I played Orna and I'm up to level 135 now, so
1608020	1609080	Nice, good work
1609080	1610280	It's so funny
1610280	1615320	Watching you like bring up Orna here at this place and you only see the two buildings because I'm gonna show you what it really
1615320	1616440	looks like
1616440	1624120	There's like so many buildings. You can't see but yeah, so oh no. No, I understand like at my house I have
1624760	1626860	That's what it really looks like. Oh that that
1627520	1629920	That that's silly that that that oh
1630800	1634840	Geez, yeah, I have like let's see in front of my house
1634840	1639020	I've got a keep I've got there happens to be a naturally a one of the
1639520	1642260	Arcanists or whatever is there and then I have a blacksmith
1643360	1645360	a bestiary and I
1646360	1648360	Think
1648520	1650440	11 or 12 shops
1650440	1652480	It is pretty cool that you can build your own stuff
1652480	1657120	Like imagine if you could like build your own pokey stops and Pokemon go which I get you can kind of do that
1657120	1660600	But not really but I mean like just as easy as like clicking a button and putting it down like that's pretty cool
1660600	1660800	Yeah
1660800	1666280	So 11 or 12 shops because I I'm trying to get earth stone for my weapon
1666280	1672480	They have and so in order to be able to have that stuff cycle out also arena tokens monster remains and stuff like that
1672480	1677760	So they're all level 10 and then I just have a ton of them. So their inventory constantly refreshes
1678520	1684020	So yeah, I played a lot of that and then I did play things other than Orna though
1684800	1686800	actual games so I
1686880	1691680	Of course after the show or shortly after the show I was playing
1692720	1696920	Yyrs game so that oh, yeah sharpshooter was cute. Yes. That's fine
1696920	1701280	I played sharpshooter quite a bit buy that this week you guys support why we are on the team
1701320	1703320	so I played that and then I
1704240	1705720	also
1705720	1709120	decided because I've been toying around with setting up a
1709960	1711960	Minecraft bedrock server
1712640	1715160	But I didn't want to go through the hassle of setting that all up
1715160	1718480	So I just I decided to try their realms that they have
1718600	1721420	So minecraft realms for those who don't know they have realm
1721480	1726000	Pro is what they call it now and it's up to 10 10 people can join your realm
1726000	1729140	It's basically on any of the Xbox switch PC
1730060	1735500	Android iOS versions, I think PlayStation 4 supported now as well, maybe
1736500	1739140	but anyways, you can set up it's like a
1739900	1746900	server sort of and you can dump whatever level you want in there and you can do even like the
1748160	1751780	Minecraft shop mods are not really mods like behavior packs and
1753020	1755860	Graphics packs, but we didn't do any of that stuff. We just kept it vanilla
1756620	1757820	Minecraft
1757820	1759900	so I just dumped in a
1761220	1764740	Level that I found the seed that's fork and shirt balls
1765620	1773060	It's great. It's got two villages right there when you first spawn in so we started that and then did some stuff
1773060	1778820	So my kids and I have been playing basically on a server for like the last couple days and they just love it being able
1778820	1783900	To play together. So, you know, my one sons on the switch the other ones on his PC and then I'm on my PC
1783940	1785940	So it worked out pretty cool
1786820	1788880	So I've been doing that and then
1789620	1791300	What else?
1791300	1795360	Didn't work on my game this week because I was playing Minecraft instead because
1795540	1801540	They were complaining because he fell into lava or something and died and so he lost all his diamond stuff
1801540	1805220	So I had to go mine some more diamonds for him
1805220	1808460	So they eventually I got fed up with it and I put cheats on and I turned
1808700	1812020	Keep inventory when you die off and then fall damage off
1812260	1818520	So now they don't die as often or if they do die they keep all their stuff so they don't have to complain anymore
1819740	1823300	But yeah, it's been a lot of fun and I'm enjoying my craft
1823300	1828980	I do wish that the nether update was on the bedrock edition, but that'll come later. I'm sure and
1829900	1833180	I don't know if I like this enough
1833180	1837900	Maybe I will end up actually setting up a server but like I don't really know with bedrock
1838100	1842580	Stuff like who would be a good server host and in the cost of that stuff
1842580	1844580	It just kind of varies a lot
1844580	1851780	And so I don't know which service to go with whereas I would assume that Microsoft probably can handle that shit with their stupid
1852780	1855820	Servers so so far. I haven't had a problem
1856740	1858500	So we'll stick with that for now
1858500	1861640	And that's pretty much it. All right, my gaming week
1861640	1864620	So obviously the strep situation kind of knocked me out for a little bit
1864620	1871640	But I've still been playing the the phone games ingress has a fielding event thing going on right now for like a limited time badge
1872300	1875580	But honestly like there with with all the sickness
1875580	1879500	I was there was no way I was gonna be able to get I think you have to get like 800 fields in 10 days
1880020	1881940	Yeah, there was no way I was gonna do that
1881940	1885400	I just you know there came a point where I'm like you I'm just gonna have to set the bar low
1885400	1888800	So I went the bronze just so I can have the badge on my my profile
1888800	1894380	Which was a hundred fields and that was not so bad that I kind of get that in just my normal day-to-day play and just
1894380	1899580	Like micro fielding the nearby parks is pretty easy to get that. So I got that badge and that was plenty enough for me
1900100	1906940	But I hit level 15 on my second time around so I did that too. Yay. So have they given you anything for no
1906940	1909060	They haven't no they have not and that's too bad
1909060	1912900	I'm gonna not hold my breath and say that they're they you're not doing anything
1912900	1913260	I mean
1913260	1918580	It's still I still am into it for like the social stuff like the team did a really big triangle that covered San Francisco in
1918580	1922100	San Jose and it kind of ran through like the Delta in this area
1922100	1924660	So like we had to go out and clear that area. So yeah, it was fun
1925260	1929900	But anyway, I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon go like just a little I'm trying to get back into that
1929900	1933580	I'm super not into the PvP. I really don't care about the PvP
1933580	1938820	I would have done community day, but I had a family obligation yesterday today would have been my mom's birthday
1938820	1943500	So dedicating tonight's episode to my mother who would have been 79 today. But anyhow
1944540	1948900	We I had my little Bluetooth the pokeball plus with me
1949300	1954580	So I did like on the drive to Roseville, I just caught via Bluetooth and I got one shiny
1954700	1959140	So honestly one shiny Rhinehorn, I'll take it when I was expecting zero. So that was good
1959580	1965060	Final Fantasy 14 got a major patch. So Final Fantasy 14 is running on 5.2 now, which added some new things
1965060	1967060	so there's a new dungeon that I've been doing and
1967660	1972700	Some of my friends like Shane and some of the people I play with on there are now obsessed with the fishing boat
1972900	1975540	So there's now a fishing boat kind of like what you know
1975540	1978780	Remember in Final Fantasy 11, you could take the boat from Selbina to like
1979340	1981420	Mahara or something like that and there was like a boat
1981500	1984660	So now they have kind of something like that except it's a fishing boat
1984660	1989880	So you just go on it to fish and it's a great way to level fishing and I don't know why everybody's obsessed with it
1989880	1995580	But once in a while you trigger the rainbow and everybody freaks out because the rainbow makes you fish super fast
1995580	2000620	So it's fun. Anyway, silly thing but good and then here's the other big game
2000620	2004420	I've been playing a lot of this game in the past two weeks. So it has been no show
2004820	2008980	And this is one of those games that's kind of like on again off again for me
2008980	2012360	But I am back on this game and I am on this game
2012860	2017740	Harder than I've ever been before and that game is no man's sky. I am
2018500	2022300	Obsessed right now with it. Like I have been playing the shit out of that game
2022300	2026540	I have played I'm furthering at that game than I have any of my other play playthroughs
2027020	2029900	I've unlocked gold trophies at this point
2029940	2036800	So, I mean some of them got a lot easier to do like the gold trophy for meeting aliens is really easy now because
2037220	2041740	Now that you run into like ten aliens per space station that you go to it's very easy to get that
2041820	2045140	But I got the gold trophy for making two million credits
2045420	2050060	Because I lucked out and in my starter universe that I started on a new file on PlayStation 4
2050060	2053780	I ended up with an Alan was super into that game for a while
2053780	2058660	So when I show I was like Alan what the hell is this planet and it was a planet that was a it
2058900	2063100	Alan said it's like a Death Star because it's made completely out of metal and it's all
2063340	2068000	Hexagons on the floor and then all the bushes are in like hexagon shapes there
2068000	2072400	There's a very unique looking planet and I never seen anything like it and Alan said oh, yeah
2072400	2078560	Sometimes you get these rare spawn planets that look completely different and I was like, that's fucking cool
2079340	2081780	And so, you know what I did with that planet
2081780	2087120	I built a fucking base on it because it was so cool and plus the other plus about that planet is that it's got like
2087120	2093840	Gold and silver and all this other stuff like out the wazoo and I built my base right by these things called metal fingers
2093840	2096600	That will respond every few days. They give you a ton of uranium and gold
2096640	2099640	So anyway, I'm getting a little deep in the weeds with no-man's sky
2099640	2104960	But like it really motivated me to keep going on the game because I had access to all these materials
2104960	2111720	And so yeah, have you tried in VR yet? Um, I did previously on one of my playthroughs and it was neat
2111840	2115000	But it wasn't neat enough for me to always play in VR
2115720	2120900	Like I was just kind of like I don't want to say it feels tacked on because I did like the experience
2121480	2127880	But I just prefer the traditional monitor or TV experience with headphones. Yeah, it's a little better for me
2127880	2130760	I'm not that VR is bad. It's just you know, I just I
2131400	2135320	When I play something like no-man's sky I can get into that for like three hour place
2135320	2138120	Do they have cross play on that or is it just all they don't?
2138920	2143960	Separate on PC and PlayStation 4 and Xbox has it too. So it is separated
2144160	2146160	But you know, it's it's okay
2146920	2151600	So what's interesting is I've been completely selfishly naming my galaxies
2151840	2155880	So what I did is my first galaxy was I think I called it Appletini
2155880	2161240	So a and then all the planets were a planet so I know my rare planet is called abacus
2161400	2165320	Was the the rare one that I found and then I went to I think boop
2165560	2168560	Galaxy was next and it only had one planet so I called it beep
2168560	2173120	So you have beep and boop and then I did C and D so I'm all the way up through I
2173120	2177880	I just landed in the eye galaxy that are for me because I've done two black holes now
2177880	2180840	So that's taking me to the eye galaxy that I think I called
2182520	2188160	The chorus or something like that after kid Icarus, so yeah, so, um, that's that's where I'm at right now
2188160	2194540	So I'm having so much fun with no-man's sky. It's so like weird but like oh man, there's this one planet
2194540	2200220	I found that was called a desolate planet and it was a desolate planet. There was nothing else
2200620	2203700	Well, it was like landing on the moon or something where there's like nothing there
2203700	2206620	It's just rock, but I got them like check my Twitter feed
2206620	2211740	This is not just a cheap plug for my Twitter, but maybe it is at mr. Rob Roberts. Mr. Rob Roberts
2211740	2217180	I took the most beautiful screenshot in that game and people were like asking me like what game is this?
2217180	2220580	This is a gorgeous. I'm like, this is no-man's sky and this is what it really looked like
2220780	2223020	So what happened is I was in desolate planet
2223020	2225460	but it was just it was just enough where there was a
2225740	2232620	Saturn looking planet like right in the horizon and a moon right behind it and then the Sun was like just it was it was
2232620	2236420	A gorgeous picture and I was just like this is this is art
2238460	2239660	Games are art
2239660	2245860	So was it a desolate planet in the sense that there's none of those stupid robots that like get pissed off when you mind stuff
2245860	2252420	Yeah, there are there are planets where there are very few or even no sentinels. I think the desolate the sentinels
2252700	2255020	The desolate planet had no sentinels
2255780	2260500	And but there isn't as much to get there's there's no plants and no animals
2261220	2264740	So it's just it was interesting. So I anyway, I just I'm
2265500	2270820	The no-man's sky has really filled that space for me that I think a Minecraft type game would
2270940	2273700	Where I just go play it when I want my moment of Zen
2273700	2277820	I just want to go explore some planets and now that they've added more to the game where it's like
2277820	2280660	I'm just gonna open up the game and do some missions at the base
2280660	2284860	I don't want to do any kick cuz there's missions that are like go kill sentinels. Yeah, fuck them
2284860	2287060	No, but you don't have to do those missions
2287060	2288020	You just say you know what?
2288020	2292700	I'm gonna do the ones that are scanned five minerals and take the item to the lost person on the planet
2292700	2296320	She had a mode in the game where I can just turn those stupid tonight. Well, I do those so
2296900	2301160	I think there is like a creative mode where you can't die. Don't quote me on that though
2301300	2306260	But I just play on like the regular mode and it's fine, but the sentinels did try to fuck me up
2306260	2308740	they will fuck you up if you try to raid a
2309660	2315020	Ruin like I took a giant glowing ball like it was some Indiana Jones shit. Like I took the ball
2315020	2315980	I'm like ooh shiny
2315980	2319740	This is mine and then the sentinels are like alert alert cuz they have like a Grand Theft Auto
2319940	2323380	Style meter now, so that took me up to three strikes on the meter
2323700	2326860	And I had to just run to the plane and I Oh fucked out of there
2326860	2327900	So it was it was pretty great
2327900	2334740	So yeah, like a giant universe yet somehow all of these robots are in every single stupid planet on an entire universe
2334740	2337780	Yeah, so I loved it. I loved it so much. So I'm
2338460	2343540	I'm really excited about I have breaking news Oh what Brie Larson is a fan of Animal Crossing Oh
2344020	2346060	She's been posting about it on Twitter
2346060	2351020	She has good taste Brie Larson one at one of the famous people from Sacramento on that list
2351020	2355380	And I said I'm hereby inviting you to visit my island on March 20th
2356020	2358020	Was it Brie Larson?
2358180	2360180	Jessica Chastain
2360740	2362900	Mandisa from that one season of American Idol
2363820	2365820	Tim Schmidt from the Eagles
2365820	2370780	Tom Hanks his kid not Tom Hanks, but his kid Colin Hanks and that yeah, and then us
2371300	2375620	Yeah, cuz Colin Hanks did that documentary about Tower Records, which is no Tower Records is also very
2376900	2379340	Timothy Schmidt lives in Sacramento is the
2380060	2381580	basis for the Eagles
2381580	2387020	Star Trek reference. So does Tim Russ to buck was a Sacramento guy and LeVar Burton
2387020	2393080	Hello, can't forget LeVar Burton speaking of Star Trek. He wasn't born here, but they named a park after him
2393080	2398960	I remember that I love playing Pokemon go at LeVar Burton Park. There's something very very satisfying about that
2398960	2401860	Anyway, all right, that's enough about our gaming weeks
2402280	2408000	Let's get into some of the news from this week because we've had an awful lot going on and I just remembered that dark soccer
2408000	2410460	I can't stay for the whole show. So I need to make sure we get to the classic
2410460	2413520	What time are you here till tonight? Sorry to do this live, but I forgot
2415200	2418520	Okay, we'll get to classic game by 8 for sure so okay, I'm I'm fine
2418520	2422560	Let's get into some headlines tonight Loki. So Sony's all about backing out of events
2422560	2426720	So, you know to join e3 and them not being there
2426720	2433840	They're also backing out of PAX East due to increased concerns related to the corona virus
2435120	2440320	You know, they said we felt set I felt this was the safest option as the situation is changing daily
2440960	2444000	We're disappointed to cancel our participation in the event
2444000	2449600	But the health and safety of our global workforce is of our highest concern and of course
2450480	2457720	You know packs basically said that you know while we are saying that Sony will no longer have a presence in PAX East 2020
2457720	2465040	We look forward to welcoming our friends at Sony to future packs events and our focus on making PAX East 2020 a
2465400	2470960	Successful and enjoyable event for all attendees and exhibitors. How about shitty excuse for we don't wanna I
2470960	2472960	I
2473400	2475040	Tried
2475040	2481840	Well, I I want I don't know if it's if they have like some sort of just like travel thing cuz I I want to say
2481840	2486000	That there's other companies that are also backing up as because of that there are I'm Square Enix
2486000	2487640	And I don't know if you were gonna talk about that
2487640	2492920	But Square Enix is also mentioned that they're not going to be I know I'm never gonna find out about Final Fantasy 11
2492920	2498160	Goddamn it ever and I should say it's that some of the staff is not gonna be like I think Square Enix is still gonna
2498880	2503160	But they're not gonna like the 11 staff and the 14 staff are not coming out damn it
2503160	2508100	And so when I heard the Sony thing, my brain was still kind of there where I was like, okay
2508280	2515280	It's not this hysteria about like one person in Boston has the the novel coronavirus or kovat 19
2515280	2517680	If you will is I think the like official
2518400	2522680	Health Association name so I'll try to call it kovat but
2523560	2526840	It's not so much that but it was like oh these people traveling from Japan
2526920	2533280	They might have to be routed through, you know, some of these other countries to make their connections to get to a place like Boston
2533280	2537340	They might have to go through a Hong Kong or something like that to do that and maybe not everybody wants to do that
2537340	2538160	So I was kind of like well
2538160	2540700	Maybe I can kind of give the benefit of the doubt in that scenario
2540880	2547040	But I was listening to Bobby before us tonight and he did bring up an excellent point that is very true about trade shows
2547400	2554040	especially when it comes to a company like Sony and that is like the the Sony booths and stuff are usually staffed with
2554400	2558200	Almost all like temps and locals and you know
2558200	2565120	The best way I could explain this to folks is like you remember the booth babe controversy, you know, where do boot?
2566120	2572840	Where do they come from booth babes come from? Let's see. Let's answer this question. Mommy. Where do booth babes come from?
2573120	2577480	Okay, so booth babes are usually and you guys know like look, you know
2577480	2583880	I'm using that term very tongue-in-cheek and I think we all know that the booth babe has been scaled back and there's booth dudes now
2583920	2590440	And there's just you know, it's it's all about with eye candy booth people. Okay, it's booth people organic eye candy
2590440	2594080	Yeah, sure. Um, so here's the thing. So I'm using booth babe very tongue-in-cheek
2594080	2599980	You guys all know that so the booth babes are usually hired through like a temporary agency
2600440	2605560	That sometimes could actually especially when it comes to LA and e3 could be tied to a modeling agency
2606020	2608460	Like believe it or not. It's not just with video games
2608460	2614640	There are lots of companies that do lots of different trade shows that love to have their booths staffed with attractive
2614740	2616700	Individuals to demo their product
2616700	2622260	so what usually happens in the three days or four days leading up to a show a trade show like III these
2622740	2624620	temps go through a very
2624620	2629980	Intense learning Sarah thing to you know, and this kind of leads into why they never went off script at e3
2629980	2634820	Right because they are they're taught the script in these few days and then they're there to demo the games and the product and all
2634820	2641180	That good stuff that's what what the booth babes are all about and it's actually I would think it's a lot of the booth
2641180	2645660	Babes are like college kids and it's a great side gig
2645660	2651400	It's a fucking great side income because it's something you don't have to do, you know permanently and it's it's a side thing
2651400	2657580	So like, you know, it paychecks for booth babes, right? But anyway, the reason why I say all that is because
2658140	2663020	They're not gonna be flying in a bunch of people from Asia. They staff their booth with
2663500	2670800	Cody fingers booth babes or the the model I would still think that there may be some staff there, but maybe minimal
2671260	2673260	yeah, so
2673460	2680220	So anyway, my point is is that they could fully staff a booth now bringing in the staff from Asia
2680560	2688300	You know maybe out of out of an abundance of caution or maybe if somebody that works for Sony quite simply said
2688300	2690240	I don't want to do it, you know
2690240	2692600	Whether we think they're being hysterical or not
2692800	2695240	Nobody should have to do anything against their will so fine
2695240	2700160	If somebody didn't want to come to PAX because they just don't want to go outside fine. That's their choice
2700160	2705960	I respect that but it does seem like pulling out of the entire show where it's like no booth at all
2706320	2709480	Nothing to do or see here that does feel a bit extreme
2710000	2715160	Especially when there's one person in all of Boston and they know who it is. Are we as paxies right now?
2715960	2719200	I believe it's next weekend next weekend. Yeah, so
2720200	2722920	Unfortunately, no Sony no Square Enix
2723320	2729160	This is starting to affect GDC as well where oculus will no longer be doing GDC and so on and so on
2729160	2732200	But you know when it comes to VR people are putting on those headsets
2732400	2738760	So I could see where maybe I mean even though they always wipe it if you ever see a VR booth anywhere
2738800	2742600	There is always right next to the giant device that goes on your head
2742600	2748920	There's an equally giant box of wet wipes to sanitize and wipe those things down between every single person that plays them
2748920	2752960	so I mean they already take precautions why because
2753560	2755560	They're still always just
2756560	2762520	Because it's a con in people are disgusting or using coronavirus in an unironic term
2762600	2767080	There's always sickness like con plague and all that stuff. I've got the corona virus
2767080	2772280	I'm drinking Corona and I'm full of germs. So anyway, um, just don't get me started
2772360	2772840	Yeah
2772840	2773760	so anyway
2773760	2777640	and then Bobby Blackwell says the Boston mayor has formally asked Sony to
2777760	2783600	Reconsider and that's an excellent point too is that this is economy, you know, these big shows are big economy for all this
2783600	2786840	This is very very interesting. I'm just I'm surprised
2786840	2792160	They're not at least even if they're holding back the staff for whatever reason they don't want to go fine at least
2792760	2800400	hire the local folks to put on the staff the booth fly some of the folks from San Francisco and still have a
2800840	2806440	Reduced presence even other like things like if they really wanted like people to answer questions and stuff
2806480	2812280	I mean like I know like trade shows that our company participates in they'll even do
2812680	2817660	Teleconferencing for certain individuals to answer questions and have one-on-one interactions that way
2818000	2822440	But I guess that's investment in effort that they don't want to make and DJ
2822440	2829480	Rama S says forget coronavirus learned a freakin shower bonds double-oh-six says I see people walking out of the restroom every damn day
2829480	2834680	You know what? You're absolutely right. Like I'm sorry. I don't mean to be crude today. I thought today
2834720	2838840	We're gonna we're gonna talk about this right now because when it comes to conventions like packs and stuff
2838840	2844840	It's not fucking kovat you should be worried about it's people who wipe their butt and then don't wash their hands or better yet
2844840	2849840	Okay, like fucking we need to have an education on that and dudes you've all seen it
2849840	2854480	I know you have you have seen that guy didn't that guy just come out of the stall did they not stuff?
2854480	2857800	Oh my god or better. Yeah, I never run into that in the women's bathroom
2857800	2863200	Just saying well better yet. We have toilets with goddamn motion sensors to flush them
2863200	2868920	You literally have to not touch them at all and you're not flushing the fucking toilet. You're leaving your shit
2870040	2872040	that is ridiculous, like
2872240	2877480	Move your hand in the general direction of the toilet and it will flush on its own
2878320	2884960	Like how hard is it or there's a relatively inoffensive button that you can push that will override and do it, you know
2884960	2888840	well, you're gonna wash your hands anyways, or maybe I guess you're not washing your hands, but just like
2889840	2892240	Triggered the fucking thing. So my point is
2892880	2894880	Sony should be more worried about
2895040	2900920	Funk boys who don't wash their hands after wiping their butt. He should be kovat 19
2900920	2906600	I'm sorry to be crude, but I'm fucking honest. I'm on it. You all know it. You know it you've seen it dudes
2906600	2908600	You know it firsthand
2911520	2916960	Pod culture in chat says orange lounge flush. Oh, so anyway
2919480	2920280	I
2920280	2924720	Agree, there are things that we might need to be a little more worried about and if you know
2924720	2929580	What if the World Health Organization were to come in and say maybe don't do packs
2929880	2934240	Then I would completely change my tone with all of this if the government says it
2934360	2940160	Steps in and says maybe you shouldn't then fine. You know what out of whatever caution then we're not gonna do it
2940160	2941960	But they haven't come in and said that yet
2941960	2947000	I'm missing the next two weeks of live. Oh, well are because I'm going on a cruise. I yes
2947040	2951080	I'm going on a cruise ship, and we know those are all the rage in the news right now
2951080	2956920	But you know what that's one ship out of what probably a thousand, and that's just ones that are based
2956920	2961800	So it's just hypothetically speaking here. Do they have a certain point which?
2962800	2965840	They don't get their deposit back on the booth space
2965840	2971240	And maybe there's a clause that says some sort of like health issue that they can back out of it because of
2972160	2973200	I
2973200	2975880	Maybe it's a little tinfoil hatty, but it could be
2977040	2979040	So yeah anyway
2979360	2983800	S 200 Matt says Italy is canceling a lot of public events including a ton of soccer matches
2983800	2986520	Then if that's what the government feels like they have to do then so be it
2986520	2991640	But I'm still going on that cruise, and you know what I I ain't afraid of no coronavirus
2992120	2994580	So I already just had strep
2997960	3000700	Among nameless other things I mean whatever anyway
3000700	3003900	I just hope the celebrities don't start pulling out
3003900	3006540	I mean I'm not huge on celebrity culture
3006540	3010540	So it's like whatever if they if they but I'll be very sad if all of a sudden next week
3010540	3013680	It's like all the celebrities who were gonna go on the cruise decided not to anymore
3014780	3016780	That'd be sad anyway
3018780	3024500	Bobby black wolf says they pulled out of GDC a day after you could get refunds on your hotels
3024660	3029260	So a lot of devs that were in the Sony and oculus boosts are left footing the bill
3029380	3036840	With nowhere to show their game and no ticket into GDC as all the exhibitor badges were pulled. That's a yikes Wow
3037620	3043940	That reminds me of a different packed story doesn't it Bobby black wolf doesn't it we won't get into that here
3045180	3049680	Let's see s to 100 Matt says all I have to say is that if I spent money to fly to Boston
3050020	3053580	Fought to get a hotel room used vacation days for certain companies to not show up
3053580	3055580	I would be pissed. Yeah, I mean, it's
3055620	3058340	Where do you draw there? There is a fine line between?
3059100	3061100	abundance of caution and
3061340	3066240	Too much caution and this probably for paranoia paranoia. That's a good word for it, too
3066500	3070100	And racism just saying well and well and some of this stuff with code
3070100	3073080	I didn't even realize some of this stuff was going on until I heard like
3074140	3080040	Chinatown is being less frequented in some places and people are like not going to Chinese restaurants
3080040	3083520	That is the most ridiculous racism, it's the most ridiculous fucking thing
3083520	3089400	I've heard in my entire life like honestly like please people please more people die of the flu
3090120	3091080	annually
3091080	3094440	Then are dying from this or car crashes, honestly
3094760	3100800	Like probably have better chances of being killed by a cow there. There is more chance of me
3101360	3108720	Getting in a Titanic type of situation on the cruise than there is of the kovat situation happening on that cruise. So
3109320	3111320	There you go anyway
3112080	3118120	Let's move on and I want to talk about angry world life weird world real-world diseases and things like that
3118440	3123800	Let's talk about other types of PlayStation look at all of the things that Playstations backing out of now including
3123800	3126720	I I kind of don't think this one is as big a deal
3126720	3129880	But are they afraid of the e-corona virus now?
3129880	3131380	So they're closing there
3131380	3131880	Okay
3131880	3136440	Look, so Sony if you didn't know has run their own official message boards
3136480	3139540	And this is a place where you can post and talk about games
3139920	3145920	You can troubleshoot ask for help and you can get into internet arguments with strangers
3146120	3150760	Isn't that what it's all about but no longer as of February 27th
3151120	3158000	They announced over at PlayStation comm beginning 27th of February the PlayStation comm forums will no longer be available
3158320	3164440	We invite you to continue the conversation via PlayStation blog Twitter Facebook and Instagram for product support
3164440	3169640	Please visit the support site PlayStation comm slash help and you know what Loki this is why I'm like
3169640	3175360	This really isn't that big a deal because welcome. Welcome to when vog network pulled the forums in 2017
3176040	3182520	Because when nobody was using them we were inundated by spammers and we found that people just prefer
3182680	3188280	Discord or they just prefer other ways of talking so on this one. I'm gonna give Sony a pass
3189040	3190360	forums
3190360	3195320	Forums have been a great thing in the past forums were a great piece of internet history
3195320	3200720	But I think most people in general have just moved on and forums of that sort are just no longer necessary
3201800	3207680	Know which forum I would like to engage in the PlayStation home. It needs to come back
3208480	3212040	Yeah, I would like to see but I will give up the forums for PlayStation home
3212040	3214040	But I'm not gonna hold my breath on that
3214640	3216560	so
3216560	3219640	Anyway, um, let's move on to another story dark Sakura
3220360	3224160	Well, this could be seen as just a massive, you know
3226160	3233600	But the IRS has confirmed that well of all the things that can be considered currency
3234520	3236940	video game in game currency is not
3238000	3245920	They confirmed that currencies collected within video games are not subject to the same tax obligation as cryptocurrency assets
3246840	3251280	So they're basically telling that people in games that use in-game currency
3252920	3257700	You can't claim this on your damn taxes stop just just stop, you know
3259640	3266760	Even though it is considered a virtual currency kind of like how cryptocurrency is it doesn't it's part of a video game
3266760	3268760	It doesn't count
3269000	3273280	They are listing that things like Bitcoin and ether
3274200	3276200	Are
3277800	3283160	Because I guess they're being used differently than only to one strict ecosystem that is being traded
3283880	3288680	As you know fully functioning currency that I mean
3289520	3291520	It's not the same thing
3291640	3293480	and in fact
3293480	3298860	It was I'm just gonna go give a statement from B in crypto
3299180	3304340	I'll just read this the taxation treatment of digital assets causes potential issues for cryptocurrency
3304860	3307940	Users you should they make a purchase using Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency
3307940	3312860	They must report any appreciation or devaluation of the digital currency at a time of purchase
3313460	3318380	Doesn't work like that for in-game currency. I mean, maybe if you're playing the auction house on Wow
3318900	3320900	No, not really. It doesn't count
3321500	3323420	Sorry
3323420	3328300	Go put your roblox or whatever they're called roebucks for roblox or whatever
3328420	3334980	so this really sounds like a thing where for whatever reason the IRS had to clarify this for people who can't tell the difference between
3335260	3341020	Bitcoin and gold in World of Warcraft like you say there, you know where you actually have, you know
3341020	3346860	A virtual currency that is meant to replace currency. It's used to settle legal debts and things like that
3347380	3352740	Whereas, you know, you can't really settle legal debts with Warcraft gold. I mean, I guess you could but
3353420	3357620	I think most reasonable people would understand that's not an actual thing that people do
3357620	3362380	Oh and one of the things is that they had something that made it sound like video game currency could be included
3362380	3366980	But they changed that off of the website very quickly and the quote from the IRS
3367220	3371140	The IRS recognizes the language on our page potentially cause concern for some taxpayers
3371820	3376580	Transacting in a virtual in virtual currencies as part of a game that do not leave the game environment
3377140	3382980	Virtual currencies that are not convertible would not require a taxpayer to indicate this on their tax return end of story
3382980	3386700	Yeah, and Bobby's pointing out and I think kind of coupling with what you just said
3386700	3392380	The IRS literally did list roblox and v-bucks on their tax forms. That's why people were worried
3392380	3395540	I mean, this is also about the government not understanding it Nick Lee
3396300	3403180	They could convert the roblox into money because because that's how it works on that service is you basically create
3403860	3412020	Content and people you can charge premium stuff for that content and the people pay with the roblox and then you then get paid
3412020	3414020	in real money
3415420	3419660	No, let's not teach kids this yeah, it's it's it's a little bit of a stretch
3419660	3422860	I mean I get it but yeah, it's a little bit of a stretch. So
3423380	3426380	Alright, let's let's move on to our next story Loki. So
3427460	3431660	Nvidia had has their brand new streaming service
3431660	3437460	Which is a little bit different than what stadia is offering right now or even I guess Xbox is kind of similar
3437540	3442420	So what they're doing with their service is unlike stadia where you have to buy
3442820	3448500	Games within their service and only used with that service. This actually links up with your
3449260	3456040	Accounts other places like steam epic and whatnot and then you can use the games the app purchase there to
3456260	3460780	Stream over that service to your devices and then of course you pay a $4.99
3460780	3463960	I think a month fee to have like unlimited access to that
3464780	3466260	however
3466260	3468260	Being the greedy fucks that they are
3469460	3472700	Activision has decided that they're gonna pull their games out of
3473420	3475420	the service beat due to a
3477220	3478860	Misunderstanding of
3478860	3480820	with the developer
3480820	3482820	I'm sorry with
3482900	3486360	Nvidia they said that they only agreed to be in the
3487060	3489340	beta test of the service but now
3490220	3495340	It comes down to that. You know that $4.99 fee that they're paying to basically
3496580	3502380	Run those games through not Activision servers, but in videos and really it's games
3502380	3507700	You've already purchased from those companies, but because the greedy fucks they want more money
3507940	3512040	They want they want some of that $4.99 to have their games on the service
3514140	3515960	And Bethesda did the same shit
3515960	3520780	So I don't know if I'm so quick to say that
3521040	3525360	Activision and Bethesda are the bad greedy company as you are. I mean I do
3526320	3528440	Understand just on a very superficial level
3528960	3535160	Essentially Nvidia is charging money for this product that is using somebody else's games and like I get it
3535160	3537160	they're games you've already purchased and so forth, but
3537960	3541120	Legally, and again, I'm just gonna you know, strictly kind of speak from that standpoint
3541120	3544200	Not like what's the nice thing to do but like the legal, you know
3544200	3548680	Usually in those end-user license agreements and so forth that you you scroll through and you don't really read when you agree to them
3548680	3553480	You know kind of like the redistribution of the product which is essentially what that is is
3554360	3559200	Forboding and like look I yeah, I get it Loki like it's it's the nice thing to do
3559200	3561800	It's the customer friendly thing to do and so forth
3561840	3566860	But I can also understand where Activision maybe wants like a little cut of that $5 a month
3566860	3570800	and I think they should get none of that fucking cut is what I think because
3571160	3572440	if you think about it
3572440	3577000	if anything this service is actually providing them more sales on their games because if
3577200	3581840	If for example, I don't have a PC they can run Call of Duty or some shit like that
3582280	3584320	But say I have a Google Chrome
3584960	3589560	You know the Chromebook or something like that and I decide hey, you know, I'm gonna load steam on there
3589560	3591560	I'm gonna purchase these games
3591600	3598280	legitimately and maybe some of the DLC or whatever and now I can stream it to that device and it's gonna have the fucking nice ray
3598280	3600280	tracing and shit on there because
3600360	3606440	That's what this whole service is about. It's all the RTX stuff on there. So now my shitty ass Chromebook can
3607320	3614600	You know stream Call of Duty and really fancy graphics and stuff like that that sounds like a really promising prospect for
3615360	3622280	You know that company to be able to sell the games to more folks that would be able to play them on platforms that might
3622280	3623520	Not normally support it
3623520	3628840	But of course, they're greedy fucks and can only see the short-sighted part of it and they're like, well we want more money
3628840	3634440	I actually that so here's a comment from our chat and I actually think this is on the money and I think this is that
3634480	3637360	In between the greedy and and what's really happening
3637360	3642200	So as to under Matt and chat says when a media company starts just scrolled off the screen
3642200	3644800	Sorry, when a media company starts pulling out of services
3644800	3650520	It tells me that that company wants to start their own service see NBC Disney, etc
3650520	3654080	I can see Bethesda starting their own service. Oh it is
3655840	3657000	That's what it is
3657000	3664720	It'll be broken as fuck Activision wants to charge five bucks a month for their own cuz but doesn't Bethesda have their own launcher
3665960	3668240	Activision has the battle net launcher and so forth
3668240	3671360	They want I mean if they're gonna go cloud gaming or whatever they want it
3671360	3676240	They want to charge the five bucks for their service. It's it's exactly where
3677080	3678680	Hollywood is
3678680	3682400	Model, it's the Netflix. It's what it's not a friends isn't on Netflix
3682680	3689200	Exactly the Netflix model because Netflix is different in the sense that for example just saying that everyone did off of Netflix
3689200	3691200	No, I understand with that
3691320	3697760	But with Netflix, of course, you know, I don't need to own all of the seasons of friends in order to watch it on Netflix
3697760	3704160	I just watch it on Netflix and then of course they get paid for having that content on the service because I
3704320	3711480	Don't own it but Netflix is licensing it for that. This is not licensing a game. This is streaming content that you own
3711520	3713320	That's not what I was talking about at all
3713320	3718960	I just mean like everyone's biting off of the game launcher model the way other companies built off of no
3718960	3722440	I understand everybody wants their own service because the greedy fucks so I get that
3723560	3730640	So but Bethesda, do you really want a streaming service from Bethesda Bethesda that fucking put out fallout 76?
3730640	3735360	Do you really want that you'd be lucky if your fucking PC doesn't melt from that shit?
3736200	3738200	No Activision Blizzard
3738600	3740320	maybe they
3740320	3746560	Here's the interesting thing is that when it comes to okay when we do talk about what's happening with the Netflix and it's getting splintered
3746640	3751960	So it's Disney Plus at CBS all access. It's peacock. It's Hulu. It's all this stuff, right?
3752040	3758120	What's happening? Is that piracy is coming back, you know, because people are like, I'm not gonna pay for like 11 different streaming services
3758120	3758780	Fuck it
3758780	3762240	I'm just gonna download it because this has gotten too difficult and too many people want my money
3762240	3765640	But the interesting thing is when it comes to like the game streaming and so forth
3765840	3771280	You can't really pirate that no you can't I mean you can borrow accounts or something like that
3771280	3774680	But I mean that's not really that's not really the issue here
3774680	3780360	If anything, it's just gonna dissuade people from buying your games, which okay. I mean, I
3781680	3787300	Thought Bethesda was doing a good enough job at dissuading people from buying their games already, but other reasons
3787800	3789320	I
3789320	3790240	Don't get it, whatever
3790240	3794840	I'm sure that agreements will be worked out if they're going to and if not they say they have
3795000	3800200	1,500 more games coming to the service so fuck you guys if you really don't want your game on the service then
3800760	3804480	When I can't play Call of Duty or fallout 76. Yeah
3805040	3809240	well, I guess one of those games that they said is coming to the service right is
3810160	3813060	Cyberpunk because those developers aren't assholes. So
3813840	3818480	Cyberpunk 2077 will be available on GeForce now day one
3819440	3821000	so
3821000	3823000	cool
3823680	3825000	Interesting it is interesting though
3825000	3830860	I would be kind of willing to check this out because my PC while it's decent before streaming stuff
3831440	3834560	Or for playing games. I would be nice to see like
3835160	3838560	You know some of the stuff with RTX on so how I'd play Minecraft
3839120	3841880	RTX on just to see what that's like a little bit
3842280	3843260	I don't know
3843260	3848640	I guess the one thing I can't say about this whole mess is you know at least this is one of those things where I
3848640	3852360	Feel like this cloud streaming and this, you know cloud gaming and all that
3852360	3855520	This industry is still trying to kind of figure itself out in a way
3855520	3860820	So it's not like these games are going to be disappearing or these games can't be purchased the traditional way
3860820	3863660	You've always been getting them and playing them. This is more about
3864200	3868280	Trying to shape what that future looks like and everybody kind of wants a piece of that pie
3868560	3874880	So, I mean there is that is that it's not like you're really losing anything that kind of doesn't exist. You know, I mean, yes
3874880	3881120	Most people aren't streaming their games, you know and like things like Google stadia haven't exactly
3881920	3883160	Taken off yet, you know
3883160	3888960	And that's the thing is I like this business model over stadia because at least with this I know if I'm purchasing a game from
3888960	3894160	Steam that seems probably not going away anytime soon. Whereas Google stadia. I
3895080	3897720	Mean, I'm not too confident in
3898440	3900000	Anything from them
3900000	3906000	Like I would not be surprised in the least if they shut that shit down in a couple in a year or so
3906200	3908200	But like at least with home last
3908840	3910840	Yeah
3910840	3912360	Hangouts
3912360	3915880	Not long enough. I still I technically I still use hangouts
3915880	3921120	But you can't like you can't do the on-air stuff anymore and it's and that's sad because that was a great great thing for podcast
3921560	3923760	Like I mean I would prefer
3924400	3929560	Purchasing stuff through like epic or I think even this maybe supports Google games as well
3929560	3931680	I mean, obviously if they're gonna be supporting
3932640	3933920	cyber about cyberpunk
3933920	3939380	So I would rather purchase through these sites and have that library because at the very least hey
3939560	3946460	Maybe I also own a PC and this is just mainly for like if I'm traveling or I want to play it on my phone
3946460	3953660	For god knows what reason, you know, I'd like having those options available where stadia you're locked into their ecosystem
3953820	3958900	And really I mean hell discounts alone already
3958900	3960740	This sounds like a better prospect
3960740	3966940	Anyways with steam and epic in there versus oh, you can only purchase through stadia that shit gonna be full price. So
3968100	3970220	I'll take this over stadia any day. I
3970260	3972260	I
3973380	3975020	Still think everything
3975020	3979580	Remains to be seen so we'll see. Yeah, that's that's kind of the interesting thing about this
3979580	3983220	There's still so much to see and to develop with the cloud gaming thing
3983660	3989580	So very very curious to see where this goes, especially once Microsoft really goes all-in on this
3989580	3992060	I think that is a huge key player in cloud gaming
3992140	3999580	It's really gonna disrupt everything going on here because Microsoft also has that backbone of Windows, you know to kind of invoke
3999580	4003700	So we'll see. We'll see what happens. Anyway for now. See they're like they're invoking the beast
4005140	4008900	You know when you got when you got something that's on every one not every computer
4008900	4014240	But a large amount of computers that are out there, you know, it's it's a pretty big thing to be waving around
4014940	4021020	After all, I mean how many people have played solitaire or minesweeper because it was on every Windows computer, you know
4021020	4023380	Or if you want to go back to a minesweeper on my Mac
4023380	4026300	Well, but or if you want I was just about to say if you want to go back to
4026580	4029620	What was the game that used to be on every Mac that we would play
4030980	4036900	Crystal Crystal Quest or whatever there was like actually they just removed it for Mojave
4037180	4040720	But there used to be the Emacs commands back in the day where you could play Tetris
4040740	4045040	No, and you could play like the psychiatrist game and snake
4045260	4051360	I'm thinking like way back to like in when when your computers were all apples in the education
4051360	4055560	You know when you were in high school and stuff, I feel like there were games pre-installed on that too
4055600	4060880	But anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about let's talk about a modern game that everybody's gonna be playing
4060880	4064980	I think at least everybody in this studio. I don't know about low-key, but maybe I think so
4065440	4068340	And there don't be no cloud gaming on this one
4069080	4071520	It's Animal Crossing New Horizons
4072940	4079400	Finally the dedicated Nintendo Direct happened this past week because a lot of people were thinking like when's that gonna happen?
4079400	4082240	What are we gonna get you know all the details you actually cry, right?
4082240	4087760	I just might have cried. I read the bullet points basically, but you actually watch the whole thing, right? I
4088680	4095440	Did and every Animal Crossing community I'm in keeps finding stuff in it, too. It was pretty good. I'm pretty happy
4095440	4099880	I like how they laid it out kind of kept it in their universe, too. You know
4100640	4105880	There are definitely some familiar faces that are gone and one thing that people pointed out
4106520	4108960	Fairly readily is there's a grave
4110000	4112000	There is a gravestone
4112840	4115960	And we're trying to decide if it's toward Amur or Joan. Oh
4116880	4121160	Like they actually killed off a character. Yeah, I think it's toward Amur cuz he was really freaking old
4121320	4128000	But a lot of the like the event NPCs have been replaced. I heard her said he has a new job
4131880	4136600	At least he's there, you know, he's a honey dipper now, no, apparently he flies he's a helicopter
4137120	4141480	He's your rescue. He rescues you and you get stuck when you get lost if you get lost on the island
4141520	4146220	He'll come rescue you for some of your nook miles. I don't think it's that big of an island though
4146760	4152240	but they did talk more about the way the nook miles are gonna work that you use them to buy tickets to buy things or
4152240	4158280	You save them up for other things. I think you are also gonna be using my Nintendo Awards, but don't quote me on that
4159240	4162920	But a lot of the NPCs have been replaced like Jones niece or daughter granddaughter
4163400	4166840	Something is now the turnip lady and there is this bug girl
4166840	4169280	Which I am actually gonna go on record saying that I will forever
4169920	4175220	Think that this girl is non-binary or this creature is a non-binary and I will always refer to them as they
4177480	4182160	And there's also like a new one replacing chip, you know for the fishing tourney and all of that
4182160	4184160	This one's the one it does bug off
4185740	4193040	Isabel is going to be like your island manager you can unlock I guess her later on as you build more island
4193040	4197800	But as you are on the island and save up and cultivate, you know
4197800	4201120	Your environment on the island that and you start off with three villagers
4201680	4208200	But as that keeps going you're gonna be able to actually get your loan and build your house and build extensions on your house
4209320	4215700	You can have other people live on your island, but it is one island per switch
4215700	4217700	I will not be getting a
4218400	4221980	Switch light for the record because I wouldn't be able to play on my TV, right?
4222420	4228380	Um, they're they're just a bunch I got some of the you hit on a lot of the key points
4228380	4229940	Let me hit on a couple other things
4229940	4233420	This time you're gonna be able to select if you want to be in the northern or southern hemisphere
4233780	4240820	Which is great for the gamers that actually like are in the southern hemisphere can actually have seasons that match where they live and choosing
4240820	4242060	your island layout
4242060	4245420	Hmm and choosing your oh, yeah, you have to choose what type of island that you want
4245940	4248220	different seasons have different activities like
4248540	4249860	Seeds
4249860	4254420	You get a tent to start and you kind of talked a little bit about that and then you get the loan for the house
4254420	4255660	And all that stuff
4255660	4260780	Resident services is open 24 hours where you get goods and you can sell your unwanted items
4260780	4267300	No longer will we have to wait until they're open our guards are coming back since dodo Airlines is doing the the village communication
4267300	4269260	Yeah, as I say the airport is now so it's not a gate
4269260	4274800	It's an airport and that's what allows you to either invite other players to the island or go to other islands
4274880	4279880	Eight people on the island at once so I think that's up from four if I remember you can invite your animals over
4280400	4282920	But you can also report a villager that you don't like of course
4284120	4289800	The nook phone is something that has apps like a camera and you get to use that to kind of attract your nook miles
4289800	4292120	Yeah, and then mr
4292120	4298400	Nook will give a special broadcast at the beginning of each day with possible daily activities and other helpful information
4298400	4304360	That's very ominous makes me think of though. It makes me think of how they do. I'm gonna mispronounce this
4304640	4310520	Radio extra law. I'm not gonna even bother Japanese the radio exercises where they do like a morning news announcement
4310520	4315240	And then they have the early morning exercises. That's what that makes me think of and during mr
4315240	4322580	Nook special broadcast the images of the animals who deceased the day prior will be broadcast into the sky while the cannons are fired
4326280	4328980	Right one of the say that but I would love that game
4329680	4331680	I'm happy about nook link
4332320	4339520	So that I can use some of the happy home designer stuff and you know online designs or QR codes things like that
4339520	4341520	That one's really cool
4342440	4347100	There was but then there's all this stuff that you don't that we saw in the direct
4347800	4353680	That Nintendo is not talking about but we saw this shit and there's other videos on their website
4354360	4356360	Like I mentioned the grave
4356640	4362960	Shiny dig spots are back. That is a big deal shiny dig spots our pitfall still in the game where I can push my
4364160	4366160	every one though
4366560	4370560	I mean as long as I have a place to torture Barbara, then I'm fine
4370560	4372940	I just know she's gonna be one of the three that shows
4373160	4375440	Invite Ed just so I can beat him up and kick him out
4375440	4376000	All right
4376000	4379040	I want Deena though because Deena is gonna be my gym teacher
4379040	4382120	I would love if they've evolved it so that if you start hitting
4382280	4389600	Animals with bug nets over and over they start hitting you back. This is the thing you can faint
4390560	4392560	from being
4392880	4394880	Stung by wasps or bees
4395000	4396600	Or die. I don't know
4396600	4401120	I think it's more like you'll be fainting and then wake up at home or something dragged into Tom Nook's
4401120	4404740	Yeah, I say do you wake up in the middle of Tom Nook's sex dungeon where he's?
4405960	4411520	Some of us are not into that. Hello. I didn't say I was into it. No one's into that
4412760	4418880	You but you can buy your DIY recipes, you know, you can earn your bells. You have the recycle bin you have trash
4420320	4422320	That's me. I mean that's Barbara
4423120	4426760	But you gather seeds you will have seasonal
4427520	4433000	Like mushrooms in certain parts of the season. You'll have like other things growing at different times of the year
4433040	4440080	So it sounds like the folio just gonna be moving with the seasons. Although I think that the the fruits and vegetable vegetables
4440080	4442080	The fruits are still year-round
4442280	4444280	and stonks
4444560	4451760	Sorry stocks turnip stonks. So needless to say you are very excited about Animal Crossing and there's less than a month to go
4451800	4453800	No shit excited about it
4454920	4461160	But I would just say that there's a couple of Animal Crossing groups on the Facebook's if you're so inclined
4461520	4463820	Just look for Animal Crossing over 25
4464460	4465920	people are
4465920	4471740	Losing their shit and posting every little thing. Okay, this is what I'm kind of excited about this dumb thing
4471740	4474780	Okay, the animals actually wear full clothes
4474780	4479980	I mean like not pants, you know, but like they'll wear dresses or long sleeves and
4481380	4487940	The the sheep don't wear scarves they wear clothes and I'm here for it. Okay, interesting
4488780	4494380	Stonks Rob. All right. Well, I can't wait to come visit your island and write all your villagers nasty notes
4494380	4497940	I did invite Brie Larson to my island just saying well, I hope she visits. All right
4498700	4500140	Bobby black wolf is pointing out
4500140	4505820	One of my favorite things is all the memes about how Animal Crossing and doom eternal are coming out on the same day
4505820	4507380	And they're all so wholesome
4507380	4508380	I agree
4508380	4514820	Have you seen like I've seen when Nintendo posted that there was an Animal Crossing direct scheduled the official doom account replied
4514820	4521740	Will Isabel be there because there's all those memes about doom guy and Isabel or like BFFs. Well, and there's also
4522620	4530740	Apparently a lot of the Animal Crossing groups that I'm in got their screenshots with Isabel or nook talking before the words fill in
4530740	4532740	The bubble. Oh, hello. That's my hand
4532900	4535000	And I've already started, you know
4535720	4537720	Making up their own
4537780	4542600	Memes about like them saying stuff because you can get the animal cries called like hummingbird is that is the font?
4542780	4549540	But people are doing their own memes about it already with like hi, I'm Isabel. Welcome to jackass or something
4549780	4553580	You know, so it's just it's pretty it's pretty funny stuff
4553580	4554500	All right
4554500	4560980	There is by the way Animal Crossing meme fill is another group that I'm in it is it is gold
4560980	4567580	It is absolute gold. All right. Well, let's move on or else we'll fall down a hole of dank memes and never recover
4567580	4574820	So let's go to actually dark soccer. You have the next story Rob one last word Oh stonks. Okay. Yes. Thank you. Okay
4575300	4577340	Anyway, this is absolutely disgusting
4578100	4580100	So
4581100	4583900	Literally as she said that her purse fell over like it was
4587540	4593600	So the army is ahead of its recruiting schedule because of video games
4594940	4600340	they are basically adapting to Gen Z by putting virtual recruiting stations and
4601180	4603180	advertising in eSports arenas
4603620	4609900	And because they're pretty much all over the place they're just getting people left and right they had they hit their goal of
4610100	4612100	68,000 troops in 2019
4613140	4615620	It's just the the thing is
4619060	4620500	They
4620500	4623580	They had fallen short years before and it's because of this
4624780	4631020	Restructuring, you know, they did add, you know, they did ads during NFL games before where the average age is
4631980	4635700	55 which doesn't exactly call in those poor
4636460	4638460	desperate to pay for college or
4638980	4645380	Highly patriotic people I guess or people, you know who are young enough to fit their demographic and I
4648460	4653860	I love two minds about this because there are people who legitimately join because they feel it's their duty
4653860	4659200	They want to and then there's some people who that is their only escape from a situation that they're in
4659200	4661200	I've known plenty of people like that
4661760	4662880	I
4662880	4669960	There's a lot of people who get some great like on-the-job training experience. Like it's a it's a great like
4670560	4671600	training
4671600	4678720	Education learning type of thing for many people but what does what disgusts me is this is not the administration that I want to see
4679000	4681000	these kids going in into
4681280	4688520	Servicing. Well, what's interesting is that I think we I want to say there was a story about how in general like recruitment was down
4688840	4690340	especially when you know
4690340	4696260	The this current administration was very anti trans and many of their policies and there's a lot of us that know trans people that are
4696260	4699320	Like this is fucked up. I don't want to support a system that does this
4699400	4704580	So I think a lot of people kind of have to kind of weigh all these factors in their minds where it's like well
4704580	4709280	Maybe I'm do I'm not doing it for the the guy in the White House
4709280	4715320	I'm doing it for me and I'm doing it for my community and protecting my people and so I I get that
4715320	4720880	Here's what else is disgusting me is a hundred and sixty million dollars. Is there advertising budget, right?
4721640	4727920	What else could a hundred and sixty million dollars do how many people could that feed how many social services that are being?
4728280	4734360	Dismantled by the administration could this money have gone into to help improve the lives of people who desperately could use that money and assistance
4734720	4738640	Just saying well and swung tongue in our chat says why is this a news story?
4738880	4745080	Well, I mean it is because video games have been part of and maybe talking about how something
4745960	4752800	Lowered by certain things. This is a way that they've gotten people interested in maybe educating people that there are options
4752880	4756680	You know if maybe your family can't afford the college
4757800	4760240	eSports specifically. Yeah, so
4762400	4763660	I
4763660	4769120	Don't have a problem with people serving. Of course if it is their true hearts desire
4769120	4774080	I'm happy for people, you know, I'm thankful for people who have served we've need needed people
4774680	4777040	Family of mine. I come from a long line of
4778080	4783180	Army people my sister was Navy. My brother was a marine, you know
4783520	4788320	But at the same time I just think that it's that specific
4788840	4791740	targeting and the combination of the current administration
4792480	4797920	That I don't think this is the well and also how poorly our veterans are being treated right now. I
4798440	4804600	Want that hundred and sixty million dollars that's being used to advertise to kids and I want it to pay for our veterans benefits
4805240	4807160	end of the story
4807160	4812360	Did your MS does want to point out and clarify just because you serve that does not mean you'll be in the front lines
4812560	4815640	No, well, this is true. My brother was in supply battalion
4815640	4820400	Yeah, but he was with the first group that went over and they did see combat. Yeah, I'm just saying that
4821360	4823820	Whether or not, you know, that's the case
4824540	4830780	It is this administration right now that I do not want to see people have to give their lives for sure
4830780	4836900	And I mean, you know it or potentially it makes people nervous when somebody's doing foreign policy by tweet, you know
4836900	4843120	It's and I would much rather that that again that that money that's being spent on this advertising pay for our veterans
4843680	4847100	By the way, do we mention that the primaries are coming up coming up in many states?
4847100	4850860	So make sure you're registered to vote everybody. I got my I got my at-home ballot
4850860	4856760	Yeah, so California is very easy to vote early. I was very happy about Nevada. Yeah, so, all right
4858100	4861100	Yeah, and Phoenix 7726 says let me also be clear
4861100	4864940	my anger is aimed at the government itself not the troops as people and I think many of us are
4865260	4870580	very much in that same boat is that you know, the troops do amazing things and wonderful things and they they
4871060	4878060	Do that, you know to support the rest of our rights to complain about the government essentially. So for that I'm thankful
4878180	4883220	No, I I have a very good friend who served us for sergeant in
4884260	4886520	She's doing it. No, she was in Texas at the time
4887520	4891820	When she actually came through on a layover for her train layover I say but on train
4891820	4895700	I got to hang out with her and her daughter at the the railroad station. No fun downtown
4895700	4899940	It was pretty fun and had a very good discussion over things. I have no problem with
4900780	4907540	People who want to serve any way that any means that they want to what I have the problem with is the tactics used
4907540	4908860	to attract people
4908860	4909740	All right
4909740	4915820	Well, let's move on from the subject to a couple more stories here before we get to the classic game of the week Loki
4916060	4924180	yes, so Activision is not happy that their brand new game mode for Call of Duty has been leaked and so now they're
4924180	4926180	trying to
4926260	4928140	Basically
4928140	4932000	subpoena reddit to uncover who the user is so that they can
4932560	4937840	Go after them for leaking their information which from my understanding was based on
4938720	4945240	They updated a brand new or the brand new update for season two of their content or whatever
4945240	4950280	and so there's a way apparently to glitch into the game mode from the main menu and
4950880	4957440	So they posted the video based on this and it's apparently a brand new battle royale mode for Call of Duty
4957520	4960280	That's gonna have 200 players and whatnot. Oh boy
4960780	4962440	Yep, so
4962440	4968720	They're not happy. They're very mad that this user leaking their brand new game announcement
4968720	4974120	So I don't and I feel like I don't often hear of them going after you know, the leakers
4974120	4978220	I mean, I've known Nintendo we hear that a bunch but I feel like for a lot of companies
4978220	4979400	They've just kind of had to deal with it
4979400	4985180	Like when Walmart Canada was spilling all those dates that one e3 like they just I mean, maybe it's because it's a corporation
4985180	4987180	They just kind of had to deal with it, you know
4987940	4991940	They didn't subpoena them or what have you so it's usually come after him
4991940	4997900	Yeah, secrets are hard to keep sometimes when it's so easy to be anonymous on the internet. Yeah, so well
4998700	5004000	Make an example out of somebody. Yep. Apparently they had like an image that was captured that showed
5004780	5006780	call of duty warzone and
5007240	5013660	The map and all that fun stuff little Bobby with an interesting point in our chat over at twitch TV slash vog network saying
5013660	5019660	They'll go after the leakers if they obtain the information via hacking and that was something that happened when Nintendo not that long ago
5019660	5024860	I remember but not for just taking a picture of something somewhere. Yeah, like if you know something
5025600	5030100	Shows up in a warehouse somewhere early and somebody takes a picture of that. It's hard to go after that
5030100	5035780	But if somebody like went into computers and hacked stuff, we know that happened when Nintendo story about that not that long ago
5036620	5041520	They will Nintendo will sue so to speak. Yeah, so kind of interesting well
5042400	5048360	They'll do they'll try to figure out who it is no matter what the scenario is right. I know that from personal experience. Oh
5049680	5056680	Yes, there was that. Oh, yes. I remember those days. So and so yes, they will try to come after you but
5058280	5065560	Not always with a lawsuit. All right, well moving on let's talk a little bit about I wonder if Activision might go after this, too
5065560	5070440	I don't know because this is a game that was supposed to come out a very very long time ago
5070440	5075520	How old is this was this like 2002 when this game was was coming out was long at the early 2000s a while
5075520	5078940	It was Starcraft ghost was the game and Starcraft ghost, you know
5078940	5081180	It never ended up coming out even though it was shown at 1e3
5081180	5084620	It was shown, you know, and so it almost looked like it was pretty close to done
5084620	5086880	But for whatever reason they didn't finish it
5086880	5093940	But now here we are in the year 2020 an early Xbox build has hit the internet and showed up online
5095020	5099280	Apparently some screenshots showed up on Twitter, you know, and then they spread like wildfire
5100280	5103520	Some Xbox groups had the screenshots posted anonymously
5103640	5109880	I'm sure I'm sure the game is spreading like wildfire on the dark web or whatever you want to call it
5110400	5116120	You know, you know how it is, you know when things come out. Yeah, but anyway, it's out there now
5116120	5120480	That's what once it's on the internet is always on the internet. So it's out there if you if you want to go look for it
5121240	5124040	There are some youtubes that are were up
5124040	5129040	Although I think some of them have been taken taken down pretty quickly as fast as they go up
5129560	5133440	But it's pretty hard to take something down once they're off the internet
5134080	5141120	So you can check that. Yeah, there's a clip here for Starcraft goes 720p on Xbox and it's it's still there. So
5141560	5143560	anyway
5144200	5149680	So, I guess some folks on Twitter are actually posting links that is a build that people can download
5149920	5154680	But it is from a dev kit and a screenshot of a dev kit. This is Starcraft ghost on it
5155320	5158640	Not everything in it is like you can't just play it like a normal game
5158680	5164360	Like I think you have to go all the way to like round three or something or state world three to actually play things
5164360	5169320	Because the first two worlds are actually broken, but it is interesting what people are uncovering about this game
5169320	5171320	That essentially was never finished
5171800	5177100	So it's it's so interesting how the game was so close to being done, but never released
5177840	5179840	but you know, it could end up being a thing like
5180760	5186620	Earthbound zero or the original mother game on the NES they translated that stuff for the u.s
5186620	5189300	But just never ended up releasing it until
5190060	5196140	Years later they put that out on was it we virtual console or was it we you one of those they put the earth
5197020	5201700	Earthbound zero that was we you and yeah, so because it was to try to get more people interested in we you
5201980	5205160	So they actually put that out for people to download. So who knows?
5205160	5210580	I mean, it's not to say Starcraft goes will never happen. But I mean, it's obviously gonna be very dated at this point
5210580	5216380	So I I doubt much will happen with it, but they could it's still technically their intellectual property
5216380	5218380	There is that so
5218420	5224140	All right. Anyway, let's take a trip down memory lane. Shall we let's let's talk about games that were released
5224260	5226260	Well in some parts anyway
5227140	5231740	Anyway, it's the classic game of the week and every week dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks
5231740	5237600	Hey you brats, you should be checking out this game. Forget your newfangled Starcraft ghost
5238300	5240700	Go back a little further and check out this game
5240700	5245780	And this is one this little little aptly timed with some of the things we've been talking about this week, I suppose
5246380	5252020	So dark Sakura go in the gaming vault and tell us what game you're gonna highlight this week. Oh gosh, there are
5252780	5258580	Well, hold on. The game is a weird one and it came up because of
5259100	5264320	The movie so I'm gonna see it's Sega Sega Sonic the Hedgehog
5264820	5267100	Yes, I said that right Sega Sonic the Hedgehog
5267700	5274600	It is the it's an arcade game with Sonic the Hedgehog done by Sega, but not by Sonic team
5275600	5283400	So basically it is an isometric game where you play as Sonic or
5285220	5287220	Mighty the armadillo
5287280	5292000	Armadillo, I can never say that. I don't want to go armadillo and ray the flying squirrel
5292600	5296420	This is I think we're we got ray in another game since then
5296420	5300340	But this was the first game that mighty was in next scene in Knuckles Chaotix
5300340	5302140	You
5302140	5305900	Use a trackball to move your characters and collect wings
5306540	5308540	It was developed by am3
5309420	5313020	And it was inspired by a marble madness
5313580	5317300	It came out in Japanese arcades in 1993. It has never been re-released
5318340	5325580	They've wanted to port it to the 32x and then it was cut out of the sonic compilation in the sonic gems collection in 2005
5325740	5330380	Because they could not replicate the control system without having a trackball
5331340	5336940	A lot of people thought it was kind of neat, but I don't know it's weird. I
5339380	5345220	It is really hard to play if you don't have a trackball, but the game is kind of neat although, you know Sonic team
5345740	5350060	You know, they they basically assisted with some of it
5350500	5352500	but like
5352540	5356420	Some of the like Yuji Naka doesn't really care for it that much
5358620	5364580	And then the reason why it didn't come out in the u.s. Is that
5365700	5372960	Sega well, first of all Sega of America didn't turn in their paperwork for the trademark in enough time. That was part of it
5373480	5375480	And it was called Sega
5376420	5378100	Sega Sonic
5378100	5379340	because
5379380	5385040	There was something about the sonic name Sega had lost the trademark for it for a brief moment when it came out
5385260	5387260	The game does have voice acting in it
5387940	5394460	Some some pretty, you know neat people in there. I mean, it's basically voice actors for Sonic ray mighty and Eggman
5395780	5401020	It used the Sega system 32 motherboards so you could have multiplayer. So three at a time
5402300	5404180	and
5404180	5406660	EGM gave this game a 10 out of 10 and
5407660	5411620	Say it said that it shatters your perception of what a good game should be
5411620	5417460	It was praised for graphics and levels and the graphics are great, you know, so that the character animations the cinematics were great
5418220	5419560	and
5419560	5422900	the French magazine mega force compared it to
5423580	5425580	Zach's on and viewpoint
5426340	5431200	Because of course they did but again, like I said as far as the legacy goes
5431840	5437420	There were some people who didn't really care for it like game spy said it was really disappointing games radar
5439360	5446520	One of their reviewers say that it had really bland level design and imprecise control and that it had some fuzziness to the graphics
5447200	5450440	I personally not a fan of isometric games. So I
5451120	5455060	Don't know that I would enjoy playing this that much. There's a lot that seems really frustrating like this bit right here
5455440	5458380	It is interesting. Like I actually didn't really know about this game
5458380	5462980	so this is like almost education for me too, but it is interesting in the way that like
5464040	5468260	Sonic spin ball is kind of like a little twist on the Sonic franchise
5468260	5474180	I don't know if I see the marbled madness in this really but because you are controlling it with a trackball on
5474540	5481400	On isometric surfaces, I guess but it is an interesting kind of use of Sonic's mechanics in a different type of game
5481780	5483200	But um lot many folks
5483200	5484220	I don't know if you're gonna get to it
5484220	5488660	But many folks in chatter kind of wondering like how can I play this or am I stuck really? Yeah
5488660	5490700	Um, you can maim it but you'll need to have a trackball controller
5491420	5497100	For this and you will not be able to do multiplayer without three three trackballs or two at least to do two player
5498620	5501300	But again for other, you know things about this
5501780	5508020	Like I said mighty I showed up next in knuckles Chaotix for the 32 X Ray did not appear in another game
5508020	5512160	But he and mighty were in the Sun at the hedgehog comic book by Archie comics
5512200	5517960	And then ray became a member of the Chaotix with mighty in in that series
5518680	5525160	The game was referenced in Sonic Generations where there was a missing persons poster of ray and mighty in city escape
5525600	5532200	And mighty and ray are playable in Sonic Mania Plus in 2018, which was the expanded version of Sonic Mania
5533800	5535800	But yeah, that's it
5535800	5539100	You know, I would say I know that there are
5540100	5544340	People who have recreated it specifically I know that there are
5544980	5546700	main setups
5546700	5548380	Where you can?
5548380	5551900	Do a trackball you've actually got like home arcade controllers
5551900	5556580	I mean there's schematics out there where they'll have joystick and they'll have trackball set up
5557220	5564140	But it's it's gonna require some doing because there is no supportive way to play this at home, you know, I
5564940	5567400	Don't know if it would work with a dial controller
5567400	5569400	But
5570160	5573460	You'd have to and it wouldn't even be the same but you'd have to
5575280	5578040	That's the way most people are gonna ultimately play it is using the
5578600	5580720	Mouse, which is basically an inverted trackball
5581080	5582320	But yeah
5582320	5589280	And and it wouldn't still be the same deal sadly because of the mixed reception there really isn't a legal way to play this yet
5589280	5593920	But hopefully you know what was Sonic the Hedgehog all the rage now because the movies done so well
5593920	5597800	You never know what Sega might look at doing Sega loves to do their retro collections
5597800	5603000	So tweet them tweet them that you want to see this game just just for the nostalgia of nothing else
5603000	5608060	I just wonder how they'd still work out the control. I mean really that that would be it
5608060	5613840	How would they work out the control and that's probably why we haven't seen this comes exactly why they?
5614480	5616920	Yeah, they were gonna bring it out in 2005
5617860	5620180	But they said that they couldn't get the control
5620800	5622800	Squared away enough to make it viable
5624160	5626620	Podculture says a sonic one-up cabinet I
5627360	5634780	Guess or or something something at least I wish those arcade one-ups were a little more expandable and then something like something else that already
5634780	5640380	Uses a trackball like don't they have a centipede millipede you do so something we could like sideload this game
5640380	5646560	I think this one would be way too much of a niche. Yeah, I know it's it's very nice
5647200	5650240	But that's also why I kind of like that you highlighted it because you know
5651120	5652080	Pretty nice
5652080	5657000	I'm pretty sure you've highlighted the original Sonic and Sonic 2 and probably even Sonic Spinball before
5657040	5660480	So it is kind of fun with Sonic being all the rage again because of the movie
5660480	5665120	It's kind of spotlight a game that like oh you may not have even realized this Sonic game existed
5665540	5668220	So pretty cool. Yeah, I mean and and
5668960	5675340	Graphically it is really nice. It is really nice if I liked isometric games. I'd probably be all over this you know
5676340	5678220	And I like that the challenges
5678220	5682280	You've got things that force you to keep moving and traps to
5682540	5685660	Spring and you have to really think you can't just got to go fast
5685660	5687020	You know your way through it
5687020	5689300	You know and that to me has a lot of the marble madness
5689380	5694660	Factor in it right there because the marble madness you had to do a lot of trap avoidance and here is exactly the same thing
5695300	5699140	All right, so there it is your classic game of the week Sega Sonic the Hedgehog
5699140	5704260	Which was only released in arcades overseas and you're gonna be very very hard to find here
5704300	5705340	but still a
5705340	5710620	classic game for giving us a different look at Sonic the Hedgehog and doing something a little bit different with it than what you might
5710620	5713560	Be used to so there it is good choice very very
5713900	5717700	Niche pick, but the good type so because I didn't even figured it was time
5717700	5720780	I didn't even realize I mean I may have heard of this game like a long time ago
5720780	5724860	You've probably mentioned it to me at some point in passing, but my brain can only handle so much
5724860	5726860	So it was kind of neat to revisit that with
5727180	5733180	Everybody talking about the movie and stuff all right, so we're gonna move on with more of our program
5733220	5735620	Are you are you staying for a little bit longer you heading out or what?
5735620	5738740	I can but I don't think it'd be long enough to get to my portion, okay?
5738740	5744660	So rapid-fire cuz we're gonna go rapid-fire right now. Yeah, I could do my stories. Okay. I have to reopen them
5745500	5750100	We'll do rapid-fire, so why don't I'll have Loki start, and then we'll just go right to you, okay, so Loki
5750100	5751340	What do you have in rapid-fire news tonight?
5751340	5756740	So we can talk a little bit about some games that are coming out of early access so for example
5756740	5761660	We have besieged which it's taken five years, but it's finally released
5762140	5766900	1.0 so that means that they very early access they finished the
5767420	5773260	Single-player campaign and they've also introduced new blocks to the game as well that you can program
5773380	5777760	Because one of the things that people like doing with the game is actually making like very complex machines
5777860	5779860	So now you can do that a little bit easier
5779860	5781100	But that is available now
5781100	5786260	Which I own that game and have to go back to check it out and then something that's coming back
5787220	5789220	Not the same
5789900	5796560	Is Grand Theft Auto 4 which you may not have known actually disappeared off of many
5796860	5803940	Game services because it was still using games for Windows Live and that was powering its multiplayer well
5804460	5806460	now
5806700	5812600	They're gonna be launching it across all storefronts including steam and rockstar zone game launcher
5813540	5815540	without games for Windows Live
5816420	5818420	But there's no multiplayer online
5819460	5822060	Honestly, that was the best part about Grand Theft Auto 4
5822580	5829820	So I don't endorse this I also don't endorse the fact that they're calling the complete collection because that's a bunch of complete bullshit
5830380	5832380	since it's not complete, but
5833380	5840240	Whatever. What am I gonna do pirate servers is what I'm gonna do because that's what I want pirate servers for Grand Theft Auto 4
5842860	5847740	Whatever you know what you take out my music in the other games and even Grand Theft Auto 4 and then you
5848540	5850180	Do this
5850180	5854700	All right. Well if you I mean, I guess no one's playing it in games for Windows Live sucks ass
5854700	5858940	But I can really want to revisit for without all that stuff
5858940	5863900	You know, can I do that like the Xbox or like PlayStation true?
5863900	5870500	Especially if backwards compatibility really is everywhere in this next generation as they say. Yeah. All right, Dar Sacher before you head out
5870500	5875940	I know we want to cover your quick stories here. Yep. Um, so and this is just a little follow-up
5875940	5883620	I'm not gonna spend any more time on it. But there is a millionaire who bought the Nintendo PlayStation prototype for
5885300	5892380	$360,000 apparently is the same guy whose company he sold his company to Facebook. So what? Oh, yeah
5892380	5894620	It's yeah, I know that dude. Yeah
5895420	5897420	Really then if you know him tell me give me some money
5898140	5905700	Whomp Palmer lucky. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, and then also Animal Crossing New Horizons will get a guidebook
5906020	5909660	I didn't realize that it was gonna be a US one too by future press
5909660	5916100	I know that the Japanese one had already been announced and actually it looks like a lot of the design is the same same cover
5916100	5919260	And all that so maybe they're just doing a translation of the Japanese guide
5919900	5921660	but
5921660	5924420	it's it's saying that it's a
5925380	5929780	Gonna be 432 pages paperback coming out on
5930540	5932860	April 9th 2020 for 30 bucks
5933420	5935420	Hey, you know I got a birthday
5936340	5938340	All right, and I'm done. All right
5938700	5943180	Well, I know you're about to head out because some you've got work commitments very early in the morning
5943180	5945580	Do you have any final thoughts or things for our listeners tonight? I
5946900	5952660	Desperately wish I could have ice cream. It would make me sick as fuck, but I want some ice cream
5952660	5955780	Just saying are you able to do yogurt or sorbet something halfway there?
5955780	5961940	No, they all kind of hit me the same way, but ice cream is what I want and it's particularly bad
5961980	5963980	I do have seized candy at home
5964300	5969100	So that shit's going in my mouth. All right. Well, we'll see you on I'll see you on Wednesday
5969500	5974460	And then we'll we'll for something that y'all will see on Sunday. What time what time are we doing on Wednesday?
5974460	5978020	We never figured that out or at least I don't know six about six. Does that work for you?
5978020	5983260	Okay, I mean I can get here by by five. Okay. Yeah, I don't usually get home till about 445
5983260	5985260	So yeah, so six should be fine, right?
5985780	5987780	fine or even
5988620	5993700	535 30. All right by 15. All right. Sounds good deal deal done. I'll be home by 5
5993700	5996660	So you guys can just show up whenever all right, I'll show up whenever then 7
5998500	6000740	Bye everybody. Hi. All right
6001380	6006720	Let's move on. I have a couple things for you guys, which includes no man's sky a new update
6006720	6012520	Yeah, I was kind of giggling because as I'm doing my big huge no man's sky playthrough all of a sudden
6012520	6015380	They're like big update and that's right a new update came out
6015380	6020240	It was the living ship update that came out where you actually grow an organic spaceship
6020620	6025420	So that is the newest update they did so it's not like a major one, but they do call it the living ship update
6025940	6031660	So you hatch this ship and you use organs that dictate the abilities. It's kind of interesting
6031660	6036940	It sounds like chocobo breeding and Final Fantasy 7 basically. No, it's horrible. I don't like that
6036940	6041020	I'm oversimplifying things a bit, but it's that concept but with spaceships
6041060	6043460	So instead of just buying and trading for ships
6043460	6048620	So that's kind of I hope it's not as terrible as that or maybe I'm sure or is it or I?
6048700	6054060	Can't remember which I hated more was it Final Fantasy 11 chocobo breeding or was it Final Fantasy 7?
6054060	6058620	They're both bad. Yeah, they were all terrible and pharmacy 14 has it too. So anyway
6059500	6061340	Can they just breathe themselves?
6061340	6065560	Yeah, they can it just be as simple as like throwing food at them like in Minecraft, you know
6065560	6069920	It's still just interesting to note that no man's sky is still doing these different updates
6069960	6072840	It's kind of interesting by the way, and I didn't talk about it during my gaming week
6072840	6075520	but it is very easy to find other people now because
6075840	6080360	There's this central hub called the space anomaly and pretty early on in the story
6080360	6084640	You get the ability to just summon it that it'll just show up in your galaxy and it's like a central hub
6084640	6085220	Yeah, okay
6085220	6085800	so
6085800	6091360	And you go to the central hub and there's other players there and while the players are there you can teleport to any of their
6091360	6097520	Galaxies where their bases are so the littles the star gates that you can build now have become huge in
6097800	6101880	Traveling to other people in other places like really fast. That's cool. It's kind of interesting. I think it's really cool
6102160	6103520	One one little shout out
6103520	6104520	I wanted to give a no-man's sky
6104520	6110800	But my other quick rapid-fire story is about the Witcher 3 with a new update that you now have cross saves
6110960	6113920	Between PC and the switch that's right cross save
6114660	6120580	Wasn't that a thing that Konami did on the Vita back in the day transferring or something like that was what they call it
6121000	6123000	Yeah, so it's transferring
6123320	6125320	But now with your switch and your piece
6125880	6131560	I thought those Metal Gear but like I don't know it was some game some dungeon crawler that they were showing one year
6131560	6134480	Yeah, it was it was on the Vita and it was on the PlayStation 3 I think so
6134480	6137180	I'm I I'm reaching for the reference here
6137180	6142200	But it made me think of that because like the cross save thing is is all about that. So anyway, I
6142880	6144640	You can now
6144640	6147020	Play so if you save a game on the PC
6147020	6150700	You can kind of pick that up with steam and our steam and gog on the PC
6150700	6152740	You can pick that up on the switch. So that's cool
6153180	6158900	Mog related bugs and blockers could get transferred from a modded PC game save file
6158900	6163860	So just be careful if you're using mods because obviously the switch doesn't really handle mods in the same way
6163860	6167960	So that could screw things up. So that's it for my rapid-fire news
6168020	6174620	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates starting in the u.s. Loki. All right, so, let's see in
6175620	6177620	The u.s. We've got

6261300	6265940	All right that I can't wait to try that Space Channel 5 game. So too bad
6265940	6269220	I probably won't get around to that until I'm back in a couple weeks, but still sounds fun
6269620	6272300	Let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases there
6272300	6278380	So coming out in Japan on the switch this week the rock man zero and ZX double hero collection
6278380	6283860	So this is another one of those main collections just Japanese getting their own release. I think I think they've already had it

6377700	6380380	All right, let's go to the mailbag every week
6380380	6385640	You guys send us emails participate at orange lounge radio.com and we read some of our favorite emails here on the show
6385660	6388260	We have one email to read tonight again
6388260	6391820	That's participate at orange lounge radio.com if you want to send a mail for a future week
6391820	6396340	But I will I will kind of like sneak in this a little shout out here because before I get to the email
6396660	6401740	Because a lot of times why why our emails us during this segment he didn't email us this week
6401740	6407980	But I did notice in discord. He was asking for people if you did get a code for sharpshooter plus from him last week
6408700	6410700	Please make sure you go in and try out the game
6410780	6414460	As soon as you can just because he's trying to get some scores on the leaderboards
6414460	6418300	He wants to be able to test multiple pages. He doesn't quite have enough scores to do that yet
6418300	6422220	so if you did get the code last week go in and check it out, it's a fun game and the
6422900	6427780	Interesting thing is that whole flash thing that came up he had that fixed within two hours after the show
6427820	6432960	So it comes right up on the screen when you start it and it says do you want the flash on or off?
6432960	6435740	So he he heard that feedback loud and clear
6435740	6441500	So if that was if that was like giving you pause or whatever on trying it just know he addressed that already
6441500	6446440	So we we love developers that fix those type of issues real fast when it comes to accessibility. Very cool
6446440	6451900	So anyway, yes, I do give sharpshooter plus a try if you did receive a code last week. So cool
6452420	6454420	All right. Anyhow, let's go to the emails
6455500	6461500	In our email this week our loan email this week is from our pal DJ rama s. Hey, let's get to it
6461500	6464900	Greetings all a couple things I wanted to share first off
6464900	6470300	I didn't realize how much of an amazing deal game pass is since installing it. I found myself trying out games
6470300	6474380	I've enjoyed and also hated this service has saved me a few dollars on buying games
6474380	6479720	I realized this as I was turning in game pass quests and noticed DMC 5 was their score
6479960	6483160	Which on a side note not in the email, but I figured I'd give this shout-out
6483880	6487820	My game pass was set to finally expire this month because you know
6487820	6490960	I did that thing where I converted all of my remaining lifetime for like a dollar
6490960	6494500	Yeah, so if yours is going to be running out sooner, you just want to extend that
6494500	6498200	I know some of you were able to get like years and years out so you don't even care but
6498560	6504660	For those like me who didn't know those little deals and things at the time and who are now converting to a month-to-month thing
6505000	6508360	Right now I think still our at least two days ago when I bought it
6508520	6512340	You can get a three month ultimate pass
6512340	6517800	Which is the Xbox gold and the Xbox game pass on both platforms three months is 25 bucks
6517800	6522720	And that would usually be closer to 45 because I think it's like 14 bucks a month or something like that. So
6524120	6526960	Almost any retailer is matching that right now
6526960	6528400	So I used Amazon
6528400	6535180	But I I'm not saying you have to use Amazon for that sale check your other retailers because those game cards are real cheap right now
6535180	6539500	So even if you have a recurring thing like I do you just put in the code and it extends it by three months
6539500	6542100	So now I'm paid through June cool as mine was about to expire
6542100	6546340	Like I didn't even realize it until I was told about the sale and then I went in and did that so
6546460	6551180	You can use whatever retail your want because that's not an ad for any type of marketplace
6551180	6558200	It's just the one I particularly used but I think they're all matching it. Anyway, let's go back to DJ Rama SS email
6559300	6564020	Secondly as I've mentioned previously, I had a nasty hard drive failure back in November
6564060	6568980	I continue to sort through my files and see what I need and whatnot. I realized I was low on music
6568980	6573660	Especially remixes first thing I did was download my exit tunes albums
6574220	6581540	Exit tunes that's the name of it exit tunes is a series of remixed anime and pop music that started back in the 2000s
6581740	6588140	Think of it as an equivalent of the dance mania CDs that came out and for those that don't know just as an aside here
6588180	6595480	A lot of that early dance dance revolution music like, you know, the iconic dance dance revolution song the butterfly, right?
6596700	6601220	I'm your little butterfly in that song that came from a dance mania album
6601220	6602340	So that's you know
6602340	6607340	That was a Konami had a license agreement with Toshiba EMI in Japan to use
6607620	6611340	Certain songs from those dance mania collections in dance dance revolution
6611340	6613180	So just a little background if you don't know what we're talking about
6613260	6619140	You know, I know not all of you were here when we were exclusively talking about music games or you weren't even born
6619140	6626540	Yeah, right. So that's where that's what dance mania CDs are. So they were kind of like that collection and sadly
6628020	6632940	Excuse me. Sadly. I have a cough sadly those dance mania CDs. You can't find them on Spotify
6633660	6640100	And so forth there's there's a playlist where somebody compiled a bunch of songs that were on those collections
6640100	6645460	So you can kind of like halfway get there, but it's not quite the same as it was
6645460	6651460	I also really enjoyed Fantasia, which was the trance collections. Yeah, but those are also not on
6652340	6655360	Spotify or any of that stuff bummer. I wish they would be anyway
6655620	6660240	Sorry for I keep derailing DJ Rama S's email, but I think with good reason. I think he's okay with it
6660460	6666960	So anyway, where were we exit tunes in the 2000s think of it as an equivalent of the dance mania CDs that came out
6667040	6674080	There is one subset of exit tunes called he may trance I had started listening to those albums and oh my god
6674200	6680360	These albums are an ultimate throwback to 2000s anime and DDR music. Here's a link to one of the albums
6680360	6685640	It's a deep link on CD Japan if you want to see that scroll down and see the track listing
6685920	6691440	Also, here's a link to all of the albums on that Dropbox link with that one. So thank you very much, sir
6691440	6695760	I'll be checking that out. He may trance 2 is the album. I referenced in the prior link
6695760	6700280	So take a look poke around and tell me that some of these songs aren't an epic throwback
6700480	6704180	Now I must return to sorting through my restored drive back up and whatnot
6704700	6711040	14 terabytes is a lot of stuff. Yes, it is. So, let's see. I'm trying to see what the track list is
6711040	6717400	Oh, here we go. Oh my oh so butterfly upswing mixes on that cartoon heroes
6718920	6724580	Erotic max don't have sex with your ex pya pya. There's a lot of throwback DDR songs on this Wow
6725140	6726860	Send your Rita the speedy mix
6726860	6728700	So these are all for those that have no idea what I'm talking about
6728700	6734780	These are all like old ass DDR songs on this CD. So they just be like trance versions of those songs. It's kind of fun
6735300	6740360	Yeah, so like I'm gonna check that out after the show. There was something I posted on Twitter earlier this week
6741020	6744900	That was something I discovered after listening to the Gus in a podcast
6744900	6751100	it's this and I don't remember the artist's name, but they basically he's like a
6751100	6753100	Like
6753340	6757620	Almost like a Captain Jack type of guy like and he even covers Captain Jack and stuff
6757740	6760580	But it'll Captain Jack passed away. So take your shoes
6760580	6766420	so so it's like that like weird Europe euro pop stuff, but like it's also extremely perverted like the
6768820	6770740	Like
6770740	6775900	What the hell the alligator project or whatever something like blow my whistle baby sort of sort of like that
6775900	6781500	But it's it's it's form but like they a lot of the songs it just reminded me a lot of that and he also has
6781500	6783500	a persona that looks like barf from
6784340	6788400	You can't do that on television. So it's kind of weird seeing that but
6792100	6794100	It's like barf or
6795780	6798820	Barf I'm sorry bar burgers barf or
6798820	6800580	Yes
6800580	6805960	barf or like Beetlejuice, it's like that look it's just really weird but like
6806500	6809920	Like I could totally see that. Oh my god. That's a dragon con cosplay
6809920	6813900	I want to do but he does covers of like he does covers like the kind of changes them
6813900	6818140	But he did cover of like some Abba songs as well. Wait, wait, hold on. Hold on. We need to take a step back
6818140	6823020	What is your mom s have you ever seen somebody cosplay barf from part the burgers?
6823500	6826100	At a con cuz I think I want to do that. That's awesome
6829020	6835580	That's a deep cut that is a deep cut but that's those are the types of costumes that are the best that like
6836100	6840140	Like 98 people you walk by are not gonna understand it
6840140	6847020	But the two that do are gonna be like that is fucking awesome. I want to picture right? That's that's the best
6847020	6851420	Oh, Bobby says I've seen that at dragon con. Damn it. Yeah, of course. They've done it at dragon con
6851420	6854420	So they feel like dragon con is the Simpsons did it of cosplay?
6855020	6857180	Well, I love the idea
6857180	6860420	I still think I might want to do it or some some you can't do that on television
6860740	6865540	Reference because there's there's a lot of like really deep references if I had a lady companion
6865740	6870500	To dress up as the mom with that very distinct like blue polka dot dress and the the gloves
6870900	6875180	What other you could be the locker jokes, it would be very very intricate
6876900	6882140	You could do it like two people in a locker and it has the you can't do on television spray-painted in front of it
6882140	6884140	You could do it. So
6884660	6890860	I love the great. Yeah, that was I fucking love that show growing up. So that's great. All right
6890860	6895020	There's so many so many people in their 20s and 30s that have no idea what we're talking about
6895020	6896660	You just had to go to YouTube and look it up
6896660	6900340	It was like a kids show that was on Nickelodeon back in the 80s and it was it was everything
6900900	6905260	Anyway, all right. Um, that was it for emails. Thank you. Did you hear on the s?
6906140	6909320	From trance CDs to you can't do that on television sketches
6910120	6915440	Just another mailbag success story. All right, we will get to discord before too long
6915440	6920560	So if you do want to participate with discord tonight, you can head on over to our discord server over at vog network.com
6921400	6927200	Discord that's VOG network comm discord and hang out in our green room and you might just want to mention what you want to call
6927200	6929280	In and talk about tonight in the orange launch radio channel
6929280	6933920	Especially if I don't know your name because it's how I like to kind of weed out some of the people that you know
6933920	6937120	Maybe you shouldn't come on here, but most people have been pretty good about that
6937120	6939800	So, yeah, we'll get to that a little bit
6939800	6942160	But first we have some more news stories for you guys Loki
6942160	6946960	So Randy Pitchford made an announcement on Twitter saying that they he is very excited to welcome
6947120	6953580	Eli Roth as a director of the Borderlands movie in development with Lionsgate and arid productions
6953920	6959640	so apparently there's gonna be more news coming from PAX East on the 27th, but
6960800	6962800	I'm excited for that
6962800	6968460	Eli Roth and a lot of those like really gory movies like hostile was not him and like cabin fever
6968960	6973120	Like weren't those all Eli Roth? I think they were those are kind of nasty movies
6973120	6978700	So, I mean if this is gonna be ultraviolet like the old game is ultraviolet. Yeah, I'm kind of okay
6978700	6980680	Yes, I guess it's why you know, you know
6980680	6982680	I'm not a big fan of like the gore and stuff like that
6982680	6989760	But I guess if it's if it's comical like a Deadpool type thing. I might be that's the right people for it
6989760	6995440	Yeah, if it's if it's done right if it's the right balance of humor I might be able to overlook it
6995520	6999960	So I think it's I'd say it. I think we're gonna see a lot of
7000720	7004000	Video-game movies all of a sudden because just in the past year
7004000	7010440	You've had Detective Pikachu and Sonic do very well now granted both of those are family and I wouldn't call Borderlands a family thing
7010440	7010920	Yeah
7010920	7016200	Now the Witcher the Witcher was well not family and that's done one of the movies that my kids are asking me to go see
7016200	7020600	Or as I know the Witcher was a book they want to go see because I show them the trailer for it
7020600	7023920	But I'm like, you can't go see that movie that that's not a movie for you
7023920	7029920	It's a free guy with Ryan Reynolds the one where he's like an NPC and like Grand Theft Auto or something like that
7029920	7033380	I'm like that movie is like one of my most anticipated movies of the year
7033640	7038440	But I'm like, no you you cannot see that not for kids. No, yeah
7039120	7041120	But I'm I'm totally gonna see that
7041320	7044520	You're gonna go see it without him. I will go see it without them. Yes. There you go
7044800	7048360	All right. So what do you think? What do you want to see out of a Borderlands film?
7048360	7052120	Do you think this is a good pairing? Do you think Eli Roth will hopefully do a fucking care?
7052120	7057360	It's just it's a movie. It's with Borderlands. I don't care who's doing it. As long as it's not a way bowl
7057640	7061880	We're good. He's not doing movies anymore. I think you a bowl has been chased out of the industry
7061880	7066620	So that's that's that I forget what he's doing, but he does non Hollywood related things now
7066620	7071440	He does convention appearances though. I know because they had him at one of the conventions here. Yeah, so I've talked to him on the phone
7071440	7072440	once
7072440	7074440	We interviewed him. Oh
7074840	7078080	Yeah, I remember you talking about that wasn't for this show. No, it's my work
7078840	7080840	because we had a
7080880	7085600	Magazine that we used to put out. Yeah, and so we interviewed him for tunnel rats his
7086240	7091500	His move his one that it kind of went the reverse. He he made a movie then he made a game based off of it
7091500	7096160	So that's kind of ironic. Well when plan a doesn't work. Yeah, try plan B. But yeah
7096960	7103160	He was he was he was okay. I mean he wasn't like his ass hole issues. You would think he was decent
7103160	7108640	He's just a person. He's just a person. That's right. A lot of that stuff is personalities and you know personas
7108640	7114360	I guess anyway, yeah. All right. Well, let's move on to an interesting rumor, but it is a rumor
7114360	7119640	So take it with a big grain of salt, but it has to do with Diablo and overwatch pass pass
7120280	7122280	passively possibly becoming
7122880	7126800	Animated series and this is because of a linked in profile update
7126880	7134280	So it was Activision's president Nick Van Dyke who actually added some interesting notes on their LinkedIn profile
7134920	7142160	saying quote executive producer of Diablo a TV adaptation of Blizzard Entertainment's IP and then was also
7142160	7147520	mentioning in the same experience section saying that it was it's being rendered in an anime style and it's in
7147940	7152720	Pre-production for a worldwide distribution through Netflix and then also on the same profile
7152720	7157240	It says developed and sold an animated series based on Blizzard's overwatch franchise
7157360	7163440	Of course, we all know overwatch 2 is coming out later this year and it would honestly just makes it those like those shorts
7163440	7166120	Yeah, very well. I was gonna say those shorts are fantastic
7166120	7170780	So like give me more that please make a series out of it seems or just a feature-length movie like that
7170780	7176960	Like I would watch that now here's something where I think I don't know about Diablo though. Here's I think it'll be fine
7176960	7180760	I hear something where the success of The Witcher I think has had a direct or Castlevania
7181320	7185520	Or that or just in general you have the video game stuff on Netflix, you know, and again
7185520	7189780	I know The Witcher was not originally video games, but let's be real that has an impact
7189940	7193440	So I think because of the success of those types of things, you know
7193440	7198200	Even even more minor and and cultish games like Ingress, you know have their shows on Netflix
7198200	7200200	I could not get into that series
7200200	7204360	I know people always watch me if I've seen the anime yet and I'm like and I watched like the first
7204520	7208040	Episode or two of that and I was like, I don't know what's going on
7208160	7212960	So I need to give it a fair shot but like all my friends that are in Ingress who have watched it are like
7213960	7219880	Like I'm like, I'm like will this explain the story to me? I'm like, I still don't know what the fuck's going on. Yeah
7221360	7226460	S2 100 Matt says Diablo being done in the style of Castlevania animated series on Netflix would be great
7226460	7230880	Yeah, I mean in theory these will be very good because Blizzard cinematics are like some of the best things
7230880	7231800	So as long as some of it
7231800	7236900	I mean obviously they're probably gonna have to bring in more people in another studio to probably handle some of the animation
7236900	7241100	But as long as some of the writing kind of remains consistent what they're doing today
7241220	7246640	This has the potential to be very successful in a place where sorry all TL shade
7246640	7248640	The games have not been doing very well lately
7248780	7254120	So maybe this is something to help help blizzard out a little bit in Activision in general
7254520	7259140	So anyway, it's very strange that the president of Activision would tweak their LinkedIn
7259140	7263740	I mean people update their LinkedIn profiles all the time to kind of brag about their current projects
7263740	7269180	So obviously this one was kind of a bad timing sort of situation, especially from somebody who ought to know better
7269300	7274860	But oopsie daisy, so it's out there. So this is one of those things where it's like, well, it's a rumor
7274860	7280700	But at the same time like why in the fuck with the president of Activision put this out there if it was just made up
7280700	7286100	Right, right. So this that's why I know sometimes y'all don't like me reporting on rumors and stuff
7286100	7290580	But this one's a little different. I really think this is just the case of oops
7291060	7295100	Somebody forgot that the cat's not out of the bag on that one yet
7295100	7301140	Cuz I'm sure presidents of companies have lots of secrets and sometimes it's hard to keep track of what have we told the public?
7301140	7304200	What have we not told the public up? So anyhow, there you go
7305420	7309500	No official comment from Activision Blizzard on this leak as of yet
7309660	7313340	Although I assume now that this is maybe out there especially coming from the president
7313340	7318420	Maybe we'll get some kind of confirmation in this next week in the time period that OLR is gonna be off for a little bit
7318940	7322300	That'll be pretty cool. Maybe we'll know more are they both animated?
7322620	7328340	Is it some of the same same creative minds buying Castlevania? Hopefully give you some of the more detail behind this
7328340	7330340	So I think I think it's pretty cool
7330660	7336740	Phoenix 77 26 in our chat asking. Can I get a Starcraft animated series too? That would be great
7336940	7340060	Well, I mean if Diablo and overwatch do well
7340060	7345380	I imagine it's just a matter of time before they want to do things like Starcraft and I'm sure they would want to reapproach
7345660	7350580	Warcraft you know just because the movie came out a few years ago, and I know it did well in China
7350580	7354700	But for most of the world it didn't do so hot. I'm sure they might just say, okay
7354700	7357220	We're rebooting Warcraft, but this time as a TV show, right?
7357220	7362420	I mean, I was just reading I fell in a Wikipedia hole last night, you know, you know how that goes
7362420	7365180	Yeah, I'm up late. I'm on Wikipedia. I almost forgot with the Warcraft movies
7365180	7366860	I fell down a Stephen King
7366860	7371540	So I didn't even realize that they adapted the mist into a movie but the mist also became a TV show
7372020	7376260	It was only on for one season recently, but yeah, yeah the mist was a TV show as well
7376260	7380320	So it's one of those things was like just because there was a movie doesn't mean they can't just come back and do a TV
7380320	7383500	Show as well ten years later. There's so many movies. They've just been
7384340	7391400	Redoing or now it's a new show or what? Fuck. Look at all the matrix for super excited. There's that I can't wait
7391860	7396900	Or day one fucking Disney's live-action remakes right like Lion King and Aladdin those movies
7396900	7400220	Those were kind of late a lot looks okay and Milan looks pretty good
7400220	7402740	I watched like half of Aladdin on Disney Plus, but then I fell asleep
7403260	7408120	I'm not gonna watch either one of those but like move on looks good and then god forbid
7408120	7410120	They have the lady in the trampoline too and no
7410940	7415960	as she 100 Matt with a good thought on when we might really hear more about this as she 100 Matt says if they're
7415960	7422100	Hiring now then maybe they're still in the early stages. Maybe this was a Blizzcon 2020 announcement
7422100	7425900	Oh, that's a good thought something to wait and show at the main stage of Blizzcon
7425900	7430420	Cuz they're not gonna be able to keep putting out huge boys every single. Don't you all have Netflix?
7434020	7436980	Moving on a few more stories for you guys Loki
7436980	7441780	So this is interesting whereas a lot of people are getting away from the toll toys to life stuff
7442660	7447080	Or the you know different toy integrations with games aside from Nintendo
7448420	7450420	apparently
7450420	7453020	The folks behind Minecraft Earth are
7453660	7459300	Thinking otherwise so they are developing along with Mattel some RFID
7460580	7462220	our NFC
7462220	7464220	like characters a little
7464780	7471780	It's like a little mini amiibo type things that you can integrate with the game. There's gonna be 20 to collect and
7473060	7479380	It'll also apparently I guess these little mini figures are going to cost five dollars each
7479460	7484140	One of these are gonna be like in blind bags or something because this looks like something small at the word
7484500	7491660	$5 isn't so bad at least way down from the price of amiibos. So apparently yeah, you can scan them and unlock different
7492540	7495780	things with different abilities, I guess for a limited time and
7496900	7501480	What the fuck is that thing? I don't know but like they have like some giant like
7502300	7507460	There's all these things in Minecraft. You're like, I don't remember that in Minecraft like I don't think that's in my craft
7507460	7509700	They have like a lot of weird things that they have in there
7509700	7513520	maybe I it may be something that's coming in like minecraft dungeons or something like that, but
7514420	7519280	And then they also have if you don't want to pay five dollars for each and you just want to collect a little minifigures
7519740	7521580	they've got
7521580	7528520	Minecraft minis that don't interact with minecraft earth and those are only three dollars for 50 cents a pop and they've got like different ones
7528780	7532300	Along with that and some of these are pretty cute. They got like a pig playing in mud
7532300	7540300	Well, you've been playing minecraft earth more than I have is not so much recently not doesn't this doesn't really I kind of got bored
7540300	7544420	With it. Yeah, like I it was there wasn't enough there to keep it interesting
7544420	7548900	They should have baked for a while. I mean like the gameplay is okay, but there's like no point to it
7548900	7551820	It's like you can't collect blocks and you make stuff in Minecraft
7551820	7558340	It's like yeah, and it wasn't so much like no one else was really playing it that I knew and so it didn't make any sense
7558340	7560740	The kind of like team up with somebody to build something
7561500	7567880	And it's just I don't know. It just wasn't worth it. So I just stopped playing it. All right fair enough blame Orna for that
7568940	7569900	All right
7569900	7574060	Well one more story for you guys and it has to do with old things being new again
7574060	7579580	And this has to do with Tiger electronic gaming handhelds. You remember? Yeah, okay
7579580	7581420	So for those I had a Simon's Quest one
7581420	7584520	I used to play the shit out and I don't have pictures to put on the screen
7584520	7586860	I'm sorry, but for the podcast listeners that have to describe anyway
7586860	7592180	But it's like those old-school LCD where it's like burn-in right there. It's like calculator graphics
7592180	7595140	Yeah, the calculator graphics are like the little like, you know
7596460	7603260	Or like think mr. Game & Watch right mr. Game & Watch from Nintendo those that was a whole line of Nintendo things like that
7603260	7605900	So Tiger electronics had their own line of those
7606420	7613220	This is something where Hasbro is bringing these back. So I don't know exactly which games they are saying
7613220	7615620	Oh, you know why we do know here we go. The Little Mermaid
7616340	7618200	Sonic the Hedgehog 3
7618200	7623580	I'll tell you guys if that game is gonna play nothing like the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 you remember the the thing about those games
7623580	7625580	They're really not very good
7626180	7632920	But for the technology at the time like those things were probably huge right before the Game Boy really took off
7632920	7639460	And then once the Game Boy had the technology there those things died because they were crap compared to the Game Boy
7640020	7645660	But you know, so so they're definitely the product of an era that most people have moved on from but if you are
7646380	7649700	You're big on your retro stuff. Why not? I collect these shitty little arc
7649700	7656700	Do they have emulators for those because I I gotta imagine they have emulators for those they've got although would you really be emulating the firmware?
7656700	7661320	Is it just like somebody recreated them or something? It would probably be just emulating all the chips in there
7661340	7664840	Yeah, like it would be recreating them of it. Anyway the other games
7665640	7672000	Transformers generation 2 and x-men project X these games are inspired by their original counterparts
7672000	7674200	But they do have some changes to design and functionality
7674840	7680320	No rechargeable batteries. Sorry, you're still gonna need to double-a batteries batteries not included
7681200	7686920	As any kid who grew up in the 80s or 90s could tell you from the commercials batteries not included
7687920	7693520	When they're a movie called that isn't there was there was such a such a well-known catchphrase
7693520	7696200	I think there was a two of them actually. Yeah. Yeah
7696400	7701400	So anyhow 15 bucks if you want to get one, but at the same time and I think this is kind of
7701720	7703360	What is being said as chat?
7703360	7703520	Yeah
7703520	7706800	dark tetsuya and chat says but my thing is how much those mini arcade
7706880	7710920	Tabletops Unix cost for the price of two of those tiger handhelds you could get one of those
7710920	7713520	Yeah, it depends which series you're buying from
7713520	7717440	I think this my arcade that I've seen mostly at Target
7717440	7721240	These are about 35 bucks a pop like this burger time one. I'm pointing out on cam
7721240	7724160	This is about 35 bucks and I think these are pretty rock-solid
7724280	7730160	I don't know like bit bigger than the $20 equivalent bought at Walmart arcade class who of the
7731040	7735480	Stranger Things ones because we were gonna give them to our cousins for like stranger thing ones are garbage though
7735840	7740040	Exactly, but my kids love them. They play them all the time. And so
7740720	7742720	yeah, they are hot garbage, but
7742720	7744240	I
7744240	7747200	Don't be like him. I'm good tip from Tiger Claw
7747200	7754860	I would have never thought to check here Tiger Claw and chat says the Internet Archive does have emulation of those old LCD games
7755360	7757120	archive org
7757120	7758480	details
7758480	7762640	Handheld history. How about that? That's it? That was a very clever place to look kudos for you
7763400	7767080	So yeah, it would be a good point if you want to check out what some of those games were, you know
7767080	7770000	And it's it's just they're just bad by at the time
7770480	7774720	They were the types of things you would play in the back of the car if they didn't get you motion sick and
7775000	7779480	it was you know something where you just would try to go for a high score and obscenely simple game as
7779760	7785440	A lot of those Atari 2600 games and early video games were they were just very simple games to you know
7785720	7790960	Before things got all you know fancy. So alright, there you go
7790960	7796400	I'm just gonna check to see if we have anybody and if you have anything in chat any questions you want to ask
7796400	7798240	Yeah, we don't have anybody on discord yet
7798240	7800080	But who knows that might change?
7800080	7801440	I'll give it a couple minutes
7801440	7805100	But if you have any questions for us or things you want us to talk about in our chat
7805120	7810040	Go ahead and ask right now over twitch.tv slash vog network vog network
7810040	7814520	I don't know if we have any last-minute stories tonight. I think I do actually so
7815120	7819560	Let's talk a little bit. This is going back in history here. So apparently
7820720	7825600	Rockstar is not or I should say take two is not too happy with a certain mod
7825600	7831280	That was just created for Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC. Oh the hot coffee. I heard about this
7831280	7835240	I thought about it. They have a show that I coffee mod for now
7835440	7840720	What's a little bit different with this one, but I guess they're just not they don't care about the details
7840720	7846120	Is that there's no nudity in it. It's just it's using assets from the game
7846640	7852320	No nudity, and I mean you're really already in the game. You can get a hand job from somebody so like I
7853200	7855200	Mean really is it that much of a stretch?
7856160	7858000	so apparently
7858000	7862520	Take two is actually filed a lawsuit against them or a cease-and-desist Wow
7862560	7868240	And they've basically said no, I'm not taking it down because it doesn't violate any of the stuff. It's not online
7868240	7873400	I'm on it's it's it's on P. It's only on single-player. It's not online
7874040	7879000	There's because they're saying that it's violating the end-user license agreement for the online portion of Grantham auto
7879720	7881800	Grand the vote read the redemption to
7882840	7886420	Which to be fair is probably copy pasted from the Grantham total one. Yeah, so
7887240	7891880	Apparently these yeah the mod does not contain a nudity or nude models. They only uses assets
7891880	7898320	They're currently in the game the animations are from the bar mission with Lenny and the moaning sounds are from character injuries
7898520	7904200	So it's just it's all using in-game assets so fascinating to see these companies going after mods
7904200	7906640	They don't like you know this kind of reminds me of
7907200	7908480	Recently there was a fight
7908480	7908680	well
7908680	7909000	I mean
7909000	7916280	it's I don't know how recent but there's a Final Fantasy 14 nude mod out there where you can basically mod your Final Fantasy 14 game so
7916280	7919220	Then even the little Lala fells are naked if that's what you're really into
7919680	7925960	And there was a live letter that was done with the producers of the game and they spent some time at the beginning going
7926080	7932520	Basically, like will you guys knock that shit off basically like not in those exact words, but in a very polite, you know way
7933280	7935040	The culturally appropriate way
7935040	7940720	they were basically saying we do not approve of those and we really wish you guys would stop because you're making us look bad and
7940720	7944560	It's not good that these things are like very easily Googleable and stuff like that
7944560	7947320	And you know, we haven't really cracked down on mods
7947320	7951880	But we're gonna start if this type of stuff doesn't like, you know get taken away
7951920	7954440	So I'm paraphrasing a lot and cutting some corners
7954440	7958960	But it's it just kind of makes me think of that where like there's probably and it's probably not just limited to these guys
7958960	7960640	There's a lot of game developers out there who are like
7960640	7965920	will you please not do nude mods of our game because then if somebody Google sit and finds that they're gonna think it's us and
7965920	7972240	It's not because people don't know how to tell the difference, right? And so yeah, that's you know, definitely a concern
7972240	7976680	So, um, but it's also kind of a Streisand effect, you know, y'all know that too, right?
7976680	7982240	y'all heard that before right because now that you've said because that was me me when I heard Final Fantasy 14 at nude mods I
7982240	7985720	Was like really? I mean not that I would install it check this out
7985960	7991600	How easy is it to get on the computer I'm curious and I did Google the pictures I saw and I laughed and I was like
7991600	7994020	That's so stupid and that's as far as I went with it
7994020	7997120	But I would have never thought to look if they hadn't said something about it
7997120	8002720	And so I feel like this Red Dead Redemption is gonna have some similar stuff. Yeah, so here's another cool thing
8002720	8007460	So now we're speaking to mods. There's another mod that's been released that now
8008560	8015400	It's by an individual named. Mr. Mr. Comet and it converts Mario 64 into
8015840	8017840	Mario Party 64
8018200	8020200	basically recreating the seven
8020960	8027040	Levels in the game or some of the boards and then they also have 70 stars you can collect in different minigames in there as well
8027040	8030300	So that's kind of cool and you can check that out as well
8030300	8036920	And I did see one also for they did Mario Sunshine as well in Mario 64. So like some crazy mods there
8036920	8040640	this one was also really cool that I saw is a
8041400	8045000	Zombies ate my neighbors doom mod where you play the game
8045720	8050880	In first person and that looks awesome. I saw that too that was really for that. All right
8050880	8052400	Let me we do have a call waiting there
8052400	8053840	They've been sitting in the green room for a little bit
8053840	8056680	So I want to get to it here and then if you have anything else we can get to that
8056680	8058360	But first let's get to the call
8058360	8062840	Excuse me. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on? Everybody is from though
8062840	8067000	Hey Rama, it is good to hear from you again because we had the email earlier
8067000	8069840	But that's I'm all for more Rama on the show
8070320	8074840	Hey, I'll just say that you have a meaning to sit like the last couple of weeks
8074960	8076960	But I've been so busy with work
8077640	8082960	Personal life and all this other stuff. I found myself this week and I'm like, I have nothing to do
8082960	8089560	I am gonna start gaming and catch up on some gaming and I'm like, I have an email to send I have time
8089560	8091960	Let me go send it and then go back to play some more games
8092560	8095640	I'm not one to criticize other things going on
8095840	8101440	Distracting from the usual commitments cuz I'm committing those offenses left and right when it comes to this year's show this month
8101440	8107520	But it happens. I mean, what can you do? I I deeply appreciate those that stick by right but
8109520	8113280	About these conventions real quick and I'll be on my merry little way and I
8113440	8119520	Understand how you got Sony is backing out of PAX East which is going to have like a financial impact
8119520	8121960	I can tell you this a few years ago
8122240	8127720	There was a big anime convention in Baltimore called Otacon this convention alone
8128280	8134600	For all the hotels the area brings in anywhere between two to five million dollars over a three-day weekend
8134600	8137020	There are hotels that were built
8137840	8141840	Specifically for this convention because they realize that in three days
8141840	8148880	They'll get at least all of their money back as opposed to an entire year now that the con has moved to DC
8150000	8154120	It's helped the DC area somewhat but not so much of Baltimore
8154120	8160720	But I do get you know how something can happen it can cause a financial impact to the city, you know
8161000	8164480	Yeah, well, that's why you have the mayor of Boston basically saying Sony
8164480	8169400	I really wish you'd reconsider because you know, they do even though, you know, sometimes we go
8169400	8173840	Oh, wow gaming conventions like a lot of people don't take us seriously as gamers and so forth
8173840	8179740	Like, you know the reality is like these, you know, when you go to a gaming convention, you're paying hotels
8179820	8186660	You're paying food and buying food there you're paying for other services souvenirs tourism if you've extended your day
8186660	8191300	Bye, you know trip by a day here or there like there's a lot of money that you spend in the city
8191380	8194740	Like, you know think about how to think about how much money I've given Atlanta
8195340	8198460	Over the past few years because of Dragon Con like it's a lot, you know
8198460	8203160	so it really does contribute to the city even even small and medium-sized cons like
8203680	8208420	You know, it used to be such a small small con the sack anime that they would do here
8208420	8214140	but now it's a big deal in California the sack anime and like the the news stations cover it and everything and it's they
8214300	8220020	When they um, they are currently redoing the Convention Center in downtown Sacramento because it was a little bit old
8220020	8221420	So they're completely redoing it
8221420	8227700	So sack anime had to relocate this year to where they do the state fair basically over at Cal Expo
8227940	8231020	and it was a big it was a big deal about how it it's
8231500	8236680	The business is different at Cal Expo because it's not surrounded by all the eateries and everything
8236680	8240440	So it's having a different economic impact and they really want to get it back downtown as soon as possible
8241080	8246440	And I totally get that that's the main reason why Otacon moved because the convention center was getting old
8246440	8249600	It was hitting capacity. They had to move somewhere else and
8250600	8255880	And as for PAX, I mean the first year we all went it was at the hinds after that
8255880	8260720	It's at the Boston Expo Center, which is basically a 15-minute walk from Chinatown
8260720	8263600	So that's a double-edged sword not double-edged sword
8263600	8268760	But you know, it's feeling the impact and people are really being hysterical when it comes to that
8268760	8271040	I mean, so it's it's a little ridiculous
8271040	8274040	But yeah, and I did we I went one year at the hinds
8274040	8277240	But I that was the very first year of PAX East was at the hinds, right?
8277240	8280280	But I did go one year at the bigger Boston Convention Center. I did good
8281120	8283200	And I will say um
8284320	8287000	Damn, I just lost my train of thought on it. Never mind
8287240	8293360	Okay, but I will say in regards to the whole coronavirus again another convention
8293360	8295360	50 years back catch the con
8295840	8302800	Let's just say a lot of people was going to these conventions sick and actually caused a death of a someone higher up. I
8303520	8307840	Really can't go into too much detail because I don't fully remember the story but it's out there
8307840	8309600	I believe we covered it on our podcast
8309600	8316840	But if you notice there is a trend and you always see at these conventions one person walking around with a sign that says if you
8316840	8319680	Can afford the convention you can afford to shower?
8319880	8326400	Okay, seriously if you're spending all this money to go to a car the cosplay to buy swag
8326840	8333640	You can go to the dollar store and buy soap you can go to the store and buy a washcloth
8333640	8338040	I mean you're really with people even if you're not you got friends there
8338040	8343640	They're not going to say anything if you ask to borrow their shower for 15 minutes. I mean come on
8344520	8348480	It's just sad how I see people spending all this money on swag
8348480	8349960	but it's like
8349960	8355760	Yeah, I think I have money for you know, my shirt on a little more this or that. I'm like you need to stop
8356400	8359560	Just stop if you know that you can't afford it
8359560	8364040	Don't go if you realize you're getting sick and the doctors are telling you you shouldn't go
8364680	8368160	Don't go. Yeah, I and and and to be clear
8368160	8373640	I specifically asked the doctor if I would be fine to go on this cruise with my whole strep issue and I got the all
8373640	8374720	Clear so we're good
8374720	8379960	And I have a follow-up appointment this week just to double-check just because the symptoms aren't 100% gone yet
8379960	8385520	But sometimes it takes a little over a week. So yeah, so yeah, I mean listen to the doctors, but also
8386080	8389800	Good hygiene is just very important and I think you know to kind of go back to the topic
8389800	8391240	We were talking about earlier, you know
8391240	8397640	Just if we we could go a long way in stopping con disease if so forth if everybody just practices good
8397840	8401480	Hygiene wash your hands and sing happy birthday twice while you do it
8402320	8404320	All those all those good tips
8404800	8411360	exactly, but I'm but the sad thing is you have people who who rather get up early and stay in the game room all day and
8411360	8416800	You know, you know how bad the game rooms get the whole stereotype you walk in and in two seconds
8416800	8421480	Like you just walk right out and people ask you why you're like won't you walk in and then you tell me?
8422480	8428900	Because it's it there's too many pigpens from the peanuts cartoons if you remember that too many pigpens in there
8429840	8431000	Yeah
8431040	8432160	Alright well Rama
8432160	8434800	I appreciate your perspective because you go to a shitload of cons
8434940	8441520	Which people can always hear about over at anime jam session and I would be curious if the kovat
8442040	8446880	Issues start to spill over into the anime stuff as well. Have you have you heard of anime?
8447680	8450580	Oh my god. Oh, oh god
8451840	8454440	Grab some grass and tea. Look I dealt with
8455480	8457040	the number of
8457040	8461400	Stupid people in regards to this. Okay, and what are the groups?
8461400	8467840	I am a moderator in there was a series of post people asking if I order my cosplay from China
8468000	8473640	Will the kovat disease be in my cosplay? Well, I guess I swear to god
8474600	8476600	Why would?
8478640	8480640	Thanks, I hate it
8480640	8482320	I
8482320	8488200	Would thank the people in that group who explain you can't get sick that way. It's not airborne
8488560	8492920	You're you're fine. If you want to get my cosplay, you're still scared by it
8493280	8497320	It's a light sauce sprayed on your cosplay or taking it directly. Let's do it
8497320	8501880	That's why and doing that makes you feel better than do it, but in reality of it all
8502560	8508960	Your cosplay is not infected. You can't mail the kovat virus to your enemies
8509080	8515160	It's not like those fucking glitter bombs you can get on the internet. It's not like that
8517720	8524380	But okay, but on a okay, so what about on the more so obviously you're talking about just like, you know isolated idiocy
8524600	8529000	What about something on the level of like Sony pulling out of packs like on a corporate level?
8529080	8534040	Have you seen anything from the corporate level get affected by kovat on the anime side of?
8534560	8541920	Not at all, but I will say this I'd say this coded virus happened a few months later down the line I
8542480	8549720	Will say the conventions on the West Coast would be affected more such as maybe anime expo or SD
8549720	8553000	CC of guests coming in I can see something
8553720	8559660	Because you just from the mere fact that like flights are being cancelled to Hong Kong and stuff. Yeah, I could see that
8559660	8566820	Yeah on the East Coast we get Japanese guests, but not as many as opposed to the West Coast
8566820	8568820	So it wouldn't be that bad of an issue
8569460	8574740	Well, we'll keep an eye on it because it will be interesting to see how things like maybe like anime expo and fanime and things
8574740	8577400	Like that are impacted. I'll be keeping an eye on that. That's for sure
8578060	8580060	Anyway, we'll leave we'll leave you on this note
8580060	8587100	You got your rating from Phoenix 77 26 and chat who says Ron was rant gets a 5 out of 5 for volume and a 5
8587100	8588940	out of 5 for content
8588980	8590980	That's nothing
8591620	8597860	Watches anime jam session and just sees my reactions to some of the stories mako-chan gives me there every time
8597860	8603020	They've actually put my head. I've actually said, okay, that's it. Good night folks. We'll see you next week
8603020	8607540	I take the headphones off hang up on the mic and I just walk right away. I just walk away
8607540	8613660	I'm just like no and that's that's probably the best commercial you could give for anime jam session
8613660	8616940	Which is hosted here Tuesday nights at VOC network
8617740	8621060	All right, my friend I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up but thanks for the call

8747980	8750260	Loki we'll see you in three weeks. Happy gaming
8750260	8754820	Hope you get to work on a game or something and maybe you'll go see see Sonic a second time

8759020	8764060	Um, I guess I'll just leave you guys with I don't know
8764980	8771980	Working more my game. I guess I don't know. I'm making a lot of progress. So it's been taking a long time, but like
8773060	8774660	Slowly, but surely
8774660	8778460	Yeah, all right, and my final thought tonight is
8779320	8781320	You know being sick sucks
8782220	8787940	Originally I kind of but here's the tea originally I felt kind of bad that I was gonna miss so much time
8787940	8790440	You know with the seven-day cruise, I'm missing two olr's
8790440	8796580	I'm missing a lot of work when I just started this new job and everything's fine with that because it was in my actually it's
8796580	8799120	Actually a condition of my acceptance. I already paid for this cruise
8799120	8801520	So I get to take it guilt-free on that and all that stuff
8801520	8805680	But my point is is that like with all this crap I've been through in the past year
8806200	8807580	Just with being sick
8807580	8812680	I had the sinus infection then I had the flu then I had that food poisoning in January remember that and now
8813040	8820520	This strep throat like honestly guys. I I I can't think of a nice way to put this. I deserve this time off. I
8821220	8825400	Deserve this time off and I am NOT gonna feel bad about taking it
8825400	8829040	So as much as I appreciate you guys being here every week and so forth
8829040	8832200	I hope you will understand and I know you do I know so many of you do
8832540	8836900	Understand where I'm coming from when I say that so I am gonna fucking enjoy my time away
8836900	8840300	And I hope you guys have a lovely couple of weeks and we'll see you again in three weeks
8840540	8845340	my only other final thought I want to say I didn't mention this earlier in the show, but today is also kind of a bit
8845340	8846060	of a
8846060	8852540	special day for me because February 23rd is my mom's birthday and if you've been listening to the show for a while you will know
8852540	8858840	That I lost my mom in 2017. So she's no longer of this earth today would have been her 79th birthday
8858840	8866380	So I do just want to dedicate tonight's program to the memory of my mom. So I miss her greatly every day. So
8867060	8872940	That's that. I'll end it on that note. Okay, so alright, we're gonna wrap up. Happy gaming everybody
8872940	8875320	Enjoy the things you're playing be nice to each other online
8876020	8877860	Don't be a dick
