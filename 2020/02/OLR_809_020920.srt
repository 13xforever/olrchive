3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This week, global concerns have reached gaming, affecting both market supply and distinguished international visitors, two very different situations created by two very different causes.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
These are two pieces of turmoil in tonight's news, stay tuned for the rest, local and global, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hello, my friends out there on the interwebs, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Live tonight, episode number 809 for this, February the 9th of 2020.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live with my co-hosts, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Ye mortals beware.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hi, how are you?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I feel dark and full of humors.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay, well good, I'm looking forward to a little sass on tonight's program.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I am full of many humors.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, hope everything's going well for you, my friend.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Mostly bitter bile.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hopefully things aren't too bitter. Gaming is fun, darn it.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Chocolate is bitter and delicious.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What is your go-to feel-good video game? Like a video game you play when you want to feel good.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm putting her on the spot a little bit, so she probably has to think a little bit. I'm opening this up to chat, as well.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
For what I have easily accessible right now, typically it's patterned, or I'll play Sims.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Because I just want to build houses and forget the rest of the world exists.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Building swimming pools and taking away the ladder makes you feel good.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, just building the freaking houses.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, there's...

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But patterned has kind of been like my unwinding game.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's not necessarily like it's a feel-good, it's more of a feel-nothing game.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Because if I'm just really irritated with everything, and I play it, I can zone out and just not feel for a while.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Makes sense?

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah, yeah.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now, if I want to be really happy, then... I don't know.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Pinball.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There's something about the... I call them my zen games.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Minecraft is very that. Even though I don't talk a lot about Minecraft, I don't consider myself a Minecraft superfan or something.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Minecraft is a very zen game, or a game that's really filling that niche right now, No Man's Sky.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, I wouldn't say that it makes me feel happy.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't really have a game out right now that makes me feel particularly happy.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I see.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Not like Mass Effect or Dragon Age Inquisition did.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You know.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So right now, I mean, I'm sure I'll feel that way when Animal Crossing comes out.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Because I'll be really happy because I'm going to go around finding Ed and murdering him.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And I want Dina to be back. They have some new animals. There's new animals in there.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And they've replaced Joan with, I think, a younger turnip lady.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why? Don't replace people.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, Joan was really old. I hope not.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But, I mean, maybe she and Resetson retired to the same animal retirement community.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Can you imagine if they started killing off the animal characters because they got too old?

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Not killing them off.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, it's going to be like that episode of Sesame... I almost said Sesame Street.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hey, welcome to Sesame Street.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Can you tell me how to get down the road?

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So is it like they're going to have the animals like...

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, high-tech master Logan.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Retirement home or whatever and then like...

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Torteurs are retired?

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You're going to walk past it and all of a sudden the sign falls down and you see Glue Factory?

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No, I was thinking like that episode of Sesame Street when Mr. Hooper died and it was really sad and it scarred us all as kids.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But they didn't kill him off. He died legit.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Well...

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That we know.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Dude, Mr. Hooper was great.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, I know.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And they handled it well.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
They handled it excellent.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If you're like, you know, a little bit younger than us and that doesn't take much to be younger than us.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But if you're younger than us, I would really encourage you to like go look it up on YouTube, bring a Kleenex.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But like the way they handled it... Remember, this is a show for kids.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And the way they handled it was like extremely well done.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Right? Yeah, it really was.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It really was.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I mean, I was just like, gosh, hold on just a sec.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Keep talking about it.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I remember seeing it on TV. That's how old I am.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But anyway, OK, so high tech master Loki.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let me let me toss the video games that make you happy.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So I will say this. I actually remember it. I was six years old.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I remembered watching the episode.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh, yeah, I was I was I feel like they reran it at some point.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't think I would have seen it when it was first first out.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But anyway, that was less sad. Let's talk happy.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So, Loki, video games that make you happy.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I have ideas on on how I'd answer this for you.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But what's your answer?

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I mean, I don't know. It depends on who I'm playing with.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
If it's myself, then I would just play.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I was playing Minecraft the other day and that was kind of fun.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If it's like with friends, it depends.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I mean, the best times that we had were modded Grand Theft Auto IV games.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I was expecting like a Grand Theft Auto or a Saints Row or something that's so obscenely buggy.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Saints Row? Well, Saints Row, like even like the third.

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I think that's one of the things that they cut corners on and is multiplayer because they have like sort of a multiplayer mode,

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
kind of like a horde mode, because remember, that was what was popular back then.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And it kind of sucked.

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But I did play it with friends and it was all right for what it was.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But it was it got it boring really fast, which is weird because like the first Saints Row game had some pretty awesome multiplayer.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And I can't remember the second one. I think the second one has a pretty good multiplayer as well.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But the first one, man, we played multiplayer and that probably more than anybody on the face of this earth played multiplayer in that.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Because we found out that we could drive the cars on the walls.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's all he did. We drive it out the window, see if he could get the wheels on the invisible barrier and just drive straight up.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It was great.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
M.M.O. is like, you know, Final Fantasy and stuff that I spend a lot of time with.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That makes me happy to like the social. Yeah, 11 was fun.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah. Well, we all played 11 like for a long time. That was great.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You know, and that was definitely like a lot of happy moments.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I tried going back, but it's still not the same.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Like, even though it was like, you know, super fast, accelerated leveling, which is great.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Pax East is coming up very soon. Right.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I've I've stopped caring about the Final Fantasy 11.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's never coming. I'm just I've I've made peace with it.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I know it's never going to happen. You know, so I just whatever.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It'll be like one of those things like a new half life game where when it finally does happen, it'll be like, OK.

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, I mean, I'm over this now at this point, but go off, I guess.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah. Anyway, let's go to our chat room. I asked you guys some of your feel good, happy games because we do tape live,

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
of course, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern over at twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network,

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
VOG Network, Voice of Geeks Network. And we do tape live right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And let's see, Bobby Black Wolf, actually in chat, one of the first ones to speak up there.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Forza Horizon 4 right now will make me happy. Oh, a good a good driving game.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You know, Mario Kart is kind of a happy fun thing, too.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Until that fucking blue shell shows up, then it's less happy. Yeah, for sure.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Cool. Well, let's move on and talk about our official kickoff topic tonight, which is Nintendo adjacent somewhat.

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And it's about a brand new Kickstarter that just launched this week.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Now, I think we had some kind of like rumors that this is going to be happening when we were taping last week.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But it was actually confirmed on the third that, yes, Platinum is going to be making a new version of the Wonderful 101.

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's a remaster, so it's not like they're completely redoing it from scratch.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But they are going to be doing this for the Switch and they have gone to Kickstarter to raise the money to do it.

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
They only asked for fifty thousand dollars. That strikes me as like not a lot of money to do a remaster.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So my thought is that they kind of already knew they were going to do it.

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And this is kind of a fancy way of some sort to get preorders, I suppose.

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Because that's essentially what it is, right? You back it on Kickstarter, you basically get your reserved digital copy of the game, right?

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You paid full price for the game, but you're helping to make it a success.

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And you can get blocked by Kamiya on Twitter as a thank you gift, which is the strangest reward I've ever seen on Kickstarter.

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But okay, I get that that's a thing. But the stretch rewards are where things get really interesting.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So and it should be noted that they have already very much blown through the fifty thousand dollars.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Like they they they're already up to aren't they? They're up to are they up to a million?

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm actually trying to see what they're up to as of the time of this show.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm waiting for Kickstarter to load over here. They are up to one hundred and sixty eight million yen.

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So you have to do the conversion on that. So fifty thousand.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's about one hundred and sixty eight thousand, one hundred and sixty eight million yen.

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Now there you go. It's in the conversion. Just take off two zero five. Oh, it just did it.

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
One point five million dollars. It just updated there. So about one point five million dollars in Maria so far.

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So some of the stretch goals that they are actually looking at doing with this, they're going to be doing ports on other systems.

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So a steam version has been unlocked with two hundred fifty thousand dollars.

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
A PlayStation four version with five hundred thousand dollars.

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Sadly, no Xbox or Xbox one listed.

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But considering Xbox has historically had some challenges in Japan and this is a Japanese developed game.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't think we're terribly surprised to see Xbox being left off.

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But we do see some new modes now. So now adding some things to the regular wonderful one on one game.

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So they've already hit time attack and a 2D side scrolling adventure called Luca's first mission.

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The next reward tier they're probably going to hit is a remix soundtrack featuring a secret special guest.

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And then they have announced a two million dollar stretch reward for Luca's second mission.

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So it's honestly by the time this thing all wraps up, they'll probably hit that too.

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So I kind of ask you guys, what do you think about Wonderful 101 going to Kickstarter?

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Because it just it strikes me as a little bit odd because it feels like they were going to do it.

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But perhaps they needed to justify to somebody.

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Maybe they weren't really able to find a publisher because, of course, the original Wonderful 101.

160
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Maybe they need to kind of justify. We want to put this on PlayStation 4 and other platforms.

161
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If Shenmue 3 can go to Kickstarter, then Wonderful 101 can go to Kickstarter.

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't have a problem with it.

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Fair enough. There has to be as terrible as Shenmue 3.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Shenmue 3 wasn't terrible. It was just really more of the Shenmue stuff.

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But, you know, I can see how it would happen.

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You know, every so often company, especially when you're dealing with a corporate environment,

167
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
they're not always going to have the vision of what fans actually want.

168
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Only look at the bottom line, you know.

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So they want to have the capital ahead of time to make sure that they're not going to lose anything

170
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
out on development costs so that they would have something that would guarantee to make more money back.

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Bobby Black Wolf at Chat says, yeah, this was a PR stunt.

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We're talking about it because of the Kickstarter.

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So, you know, good point there is that, you know, here it is, free press for this,

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
that we're essentially talking about here on the show.

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And many podcasts are talking about this.

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And Twitter is all abuzz about it, social media, et cetera, et cetera.

177
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And a large part of it is because kind of the unconventional sort of Kickstarter.

178
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And maybe Wonderful 101 kind of, and I'm using my quotey fingers because I don't mean this literally,

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
like gets away with it because it was a little more of an underground game,

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
a game that people feel not enough people really got to play or know about

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
because the Wii U's audience was limited.

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So it's kind of one of those things that feels a little bit more underground.

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So it's like, yeah, I'm throwing money at this because I want these guys to succeed

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
because this is a little underground project even though, I don't know if I would call platinum games underground.

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But don't get me wrong, I'm not like hating on the Kickstarter and this whole thing.

186
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But it is fascinating that I bet if we talked about preordering most games at full price,

187
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
something that Blizzard does a lot actually,

188
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
we would give these companies a lot of crap about it, right?

189
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Imagine no more are you going to go into GameStop and put down $5.

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Oh no, you're going to put down all 60 upfront to get your copy of Final Fantasy VII.

191
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, I never said I was going to kickstart it.

192
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Well, no, I'm just saying in general, in general.

193
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And to be fair, and I'm sure somebody's already making this point in chat,

194
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
but you can put more money down towards the game so that way essentially by the time it's out,

195
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
you get it for free.

196
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't know any retailer that's not going to be happy to take your money in advance

197
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
so they can invest it and make more money.

198
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But I digress.

199
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So I think most people kind of look at that and go,

200
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
that's pretty bold of a company to ask me to pay all this money before the game's already out.

201
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yet here we are.

202
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
This Kickstarter is asking for your money before the game is already out.

203
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But most of us are not really batting an eyelash or, you know, pointing out this type of difference.

204
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What is it about Wonderful 101 that they can, and again, I'm using my quotey fingers, get away with it?

205
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't know. I never played it.

206
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I will admit something that probably will not make me popular.

207
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I did play it on the Wii U.

208
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It was one of the games I used like Gamefly for a limited time I had it.

209
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I used that to play Wonderful 101.

210
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I didn't really get it.

211
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It didn't really click with me.

212
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But I also recognize that sometimes the first time I play a game I don't always get it

213
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and then I'll come revisit it way after the fact and I'll fall in love with it.

214
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Case in point, Mass Effect.

215
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I played that when it was first out and wrote it off and then I came back years later and was like,

216
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
the F was I thinking?

217
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So I'm not going to say, oh, it's a bad game.

218
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It didn't click for me.

219
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It wasn't something I was really excited to get back and revisit.

220
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But that's not to say I won't ever.

221
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But I'm not likely to put down 35 bucks or whatever it is they're asking to reserve a digital copy of the game.

222
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I just don't see myself doing that.

223
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But I'll be curious what this looks like when it actually does release.

224
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm looking at some chats over in our chat room.

225
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Obsolete Woman in Twitter, excuse me, Twitch TV slash VOG Network says,

226
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Platinum wants to self-publish it so they probably want to show that there's enough interest to do so.

227
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm a sucker for Platinum so I backed it immediately.

228
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And I think that's a large reason why Blizzard has oftentimes gotten away with asking for the full price in advance.

229
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They do it for Warcraft expansions all the time, right?

230
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You could probably do it right now for the next Warcraft expansion.

231
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Go put the money on that and you can immediately boost a character to maximum level.

232
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And that's what you get right now.

233
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And then you have your copy of the game on hold or whatever.

234
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's a digital copy so it's weird.

235
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But you have it basically queued up, reserved, already bought for when the Warcraft expansion releases.

236
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So Blizzard's been doing this a long time.

237
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And I'm sure there's other companies too.

238
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Nintendo, can't you go on Nintendo Shop and pre-purchase stuff?

239
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You can pre-purchase stuff on PlayStation 4.

240
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Usually it's only a couple weeks out.

241
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
They don't really turn on the pre-purchasing until it's pretty close to go time.

242
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But it is something you can do.

243
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So there's a lot of games that let you do it.

244
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
OrangeRight101 says,

245
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I played Wonderful 101 thanks to Gamefly and I'm in a similar boat.

246
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Couldn't really get into it.

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It seemed like it would be cool if I did get into it a bit more than I did.

248
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Anyway, even though I'm kind of saying, isn't this interesting how this is different?

249
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I am very happy because I do know this game has its very passionate fan base and so forth.

250
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And I think it is really cool that a lot of these games that got lost, so to speak, on the Wii U

251
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
are kind of getting a second life.

252
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You know, Bayonetta 1 and 2 did.

253
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
We've seen plenty of the Nintendo titles like Captain Toad and so forth are getting the second life on the Switch too.

254
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Why not Wonderful 101?

255
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Just because it wasn't necessarily a game I got into.

256
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You know what, clearly the success of this Kickstarter is showing that somebody out there is into it.

257
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So I'm happy for them and all these folks.

258
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But yeah.

259
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But again, getting blocked by somebody on Twitter as a reward?

260
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
A little weird for me, but okay.

261
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I was looking at the rewards because I was kind of curious.

262
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I was like, well, depending on how much it costs.

263
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
They had this amazing jacket.

264
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
They called it the Wonder Red jacket.

265
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And it looked like a bright red bomber jacket.

266
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And I was like, okay, that looks hot.

267
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I would want that jacket, but it's a very expensive tier to get that.

268
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I think it's already gone too.

269
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think a lot of people grabbed that right away.

270
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I would guess that this thing tops out around 2 million.

271
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Because most Kickstarters make the majority.

272
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Maybe it'll go all the way to 2.5.

273
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Maybe 2 and a quarter.

274
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Most Kickstarters make the most money the first day and the last day.

275
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And so are we about maybe a third of the way there?

276
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Because it closes on March 6th.

277
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So maybe we're barely getting started.

278
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But it'll make a lot of money the last day as people kind of wait till the last minute to get there.

279
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
As they get money and so forth to get it in there.

280
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But I mean, heck, even if it ended in five minutes, making 1.5 million, that's no small feat.

281
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So congratulations to Platinum Games and everybody behind Wonderful 101.

282
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And the fans.

283
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I think it's great.

284
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Akdeft in chat kind of closing a last thought on this here saying,

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah, I also have Wonderful 101 on Wii U.

286
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And while I understand the appeal, it just wasn't for me.

287
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I will say the game has that platinum charm and charisma.

288
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Obsolete Woman says, I liked it on the Wii U, but wish it had touch controls.

289
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You had to draw shapes with the analog stick.

290
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And for most of the time, it didn't register the right shape for me.

291
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, maybe it'll be interesting.

292
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And I've heard that before.

293
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
How maybe some of that is going to port over to the Switch.

294
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Because the Switch is obviously a very different type of controller than the Wii U was.

295
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So it'll be interesting to see how some of that stuff crosses over.

296
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And you can't just say it's going to be touchscreen because now it's going to be on the PS4 and the PC.

297
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Was it touchscreen before?

298
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah, you had shapes and things like that.

299
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, no, because I don't think you used the touch controls to do it because of the type of touchscreen it was.

300
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's been so long guys, sorry.

301
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It was years ago that I played it.

302
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But still, I think there were elements of it that used that second screen that are going to be interesting to see how it adapts over.

303
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
As it is with a lot of Wii U games.

304
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So anyway, that's that on that.

305
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Let's move on and talk about some of the games that we have been playing this week while we talk about our gaming weeks.

306
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

307
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's been actually a very busy week for me.

308
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So I've just been in my usual phone stuff.

309
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I've been playing a lot of patterned again.

310
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
My goal right now is I actually completely started over on patterned on a different Mac.

311
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So I can try to beat all the stages again and do it better.

312
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And I've been getting more perfect stages, so that's been really good.

313
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And then of course, you know, Animal Crossing, the dumb Harry Potter game, and dumb Pokemon.

314
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Although I've been enjoying, now that I got a shiny Umbreon.

315
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I don't know, it's just cute and I've been wanting to max him out on the buddy thing.

316
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And I've done a few of the online battles, they're pretty fun to me.

317
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And that's kind of it.

318
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So funny enough, I woke up on Wednesday. Was it Wednesday? Yeah.

319
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Because I had to be up for work and Dan had gone to bed after I woke up at 3.30 in the morning.

320
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And I woke up and he was watching one of the Metal Gear games.

321
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
One of the ones with Raiden, not Metal Gear Solid 2, but the other one that had Raiden with his robot jaw.

322
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I was like, it was the weirdest thing to wake up to because I wasn't quite awake.

323
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And I'm like, Metal Gear? And Dan's like, Metal Gear?

324
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Doing the David Hayter voice, it was pretty funny.

325
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But that's just a little anecdote of gaming.

326
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
He also built tiny Lego pinballs. Oh really? Yeah.

327
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
One of his friends ordered him little pinball tables.

328
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's a thing? You can build pinball tables with Legos?

329
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's like a special kit. You know, they have lots of custom kits out there. I'll find out which one it is.

330
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
How big are they? Like, gosh. They're tiny. They would be the size a minifig could play.

331
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Okay. Because you know what? I love my mini arcade games.

332
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So why not some mini pinball tables to match?

333
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It is maybe a hundredth of that size. Oh yeah, those are way too small.

334
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's minifig size. Never mind.

335
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So look on your thing, people. She's talking about the Twitch TV channel.

336
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Is that big? Now, flump.

337
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
She's making a little headcrushing. Because remember, we are a podcast.

338
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And she's now making our wonderful camera autofocus on nothing, so it's all blurry now.

339
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh yeah, you broke our autofocus, Jamie.

340
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
My bad. It'll fix itself.

341
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Put your hand back up in front of it quickly. There we go. That should refocus it, hopefully.

342
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Jamie, you broke the whole darn show. Good job.

343
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Way to go. Hold on, ready? Way to go.

344
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Now, I'm moving my hand. Drop your hand. Okay, we're good. Wow.

345
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
See? I fixed it.

346
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Alright. Loki, how was your game?

347
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Don't doubt my magical tech powers, yo.

348
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I didn't play a whole lot this week. I just mainly played Orna. I'm up to 127.

349
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And it's been mainly watching YouTube videos because I did discover a YouTuber channel by the name of Let's Game It Out.

350
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And it's my type of way of playing games, so he plays games to intentionally break them in hilarious ways.

351
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And I love it. Every single video I've watched of his is just endlessly entertaining.

352
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So that's what I've been filling my week with has been that.

353
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Now that I think of it, I did play a couple other things.

354
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I did play Mr. Dew in the arcade a little bit because I've been posting on my Twitter that I've been going to this local 80s cafe.

355
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You talked about it on the show last week, back to the 80s cafe.

356
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But I actually went there, see? So I had actually eaten there now, and it's alright.

357
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But yeah, it's got lots of stuff to play.

358
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm not sure if it's legal to put this in your arcade, but they have one of those iCades.

359
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I think it's an iCade. It's the 60-in-1 boards that's in some sort of machine.

360
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't believe those are legit.

361
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I was going to say, UltraCades were legit.

362
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
This is not an UltraCade.

363
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Okay, alright.

364
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But whatever, it's in there. Who's going to really complain?

365
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So I did play Mr. Dew there, because out of all the other games that they had on there, I was like,

366
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I don't want to play Pac-Man, I want to play Mr. Dew.

367
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So I did that. And then, what else?

368
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I don't know. My son wanted to play...

369
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I think it was... I can't remember if it was Galaga or Galaxian.

370
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I think it may have been Galaga.

371
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Because he got one of those little mini-arcades that has it on there.

372
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He's like, oh hey, that's a game that I've been playing all the time in my room.

373
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So I'm going to play it on the actual cabinet.

374
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
He's like, this is much easier when the screen is much larger instead of a tiny little screen.

375
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So he's been doing that.

376
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And then, yeah, that's pretty much been the week.

377
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I worked a little bit on my game this week.

378
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That's about it.

379
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Cool. Let's see, my gaming week.

380
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So a lot of the usual suspects, all the various phone games, all of them.

381
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And I've been playing Orna on the phone as well, as Loki has been.

382
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm a little bit ahead of you, but you're gaining on me, so you're playing a lot.

383
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm catching up.

384
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The hardest part is, you can't...

385
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And the thing that bothers me the most about the game is that

386
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
the people that have been playing it the longest and have had the chance to grind to the highest levels,

387
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
there's no way to take territory from them because they're too powerful.

388
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So there's nothing to kind of equalize it so that newer players can get a footing in the territory battle part of it.

389
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
If that makes sense.

390
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Haven't you found that that's a real hard thing to do, is to get territory?

391
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Well, yes. Mr. Anti-Saint Mike, who is everywhere.

392
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And then also has another character that's the ghost of Anti-Saint Mike.

393
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I think the ghost is when you haven't visited for a while, so it's supposed to make it less powerful.

394
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I think that's the mechanic they tried to put in, but it's not enough.

395
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Yeah, the ghost...

396
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I thought it was just... I put two max characters in.

397
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
No, the ghost is some type of game element.

398
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Oh, okay.

399
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So, I've been playing a lot of the usual stuff.

400
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Final Fantasy XIV, of course. No Man's Sky.

401
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But the game I probably spent a huge chunk of time with this weekend was the Fantasy Star Online 2 Closed Beta.

402
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Finally, it's here.

403
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You know, I have to... And I'm very excited that I got a chance to play the game, finally.

404
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But I have to express a little bit of disappointment.

405
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I just have to.

406
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
That it took this long for this game to come out here.

407
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It's so frustrating that these companies feel there's not an audience for this type of stuff in the US.

408
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And I get that money talks, and I get that it's based on projections and analysis and things.

409
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
But I just feel like it, especially because...

410
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And I'm sure a lot of you have heard by now, the beta test went down in the first few hours,

411
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
because so many people were hitting the damn servers all at once, which always happens in MMOs.

412
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Even though they knew how many people had signed up for it, because it was all through the Xbox insider perm,

413
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
still didn't stop that from happening.

414
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm not holding that part against it, because I get it.

415
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's a frickin' MMO. These things always happen.

416
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And they did make it up. They're doing some bonus time tonight that wasn't originally supposed to be in the closed beta.

417
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
But my point is, this should just be the proof that the demand was always there.

418
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And I just feel a little let down by Sega that they didn't trust this audience sooner.

419
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Because I know they had shown this game at E3 at one point, and then for whatever reason canceled it, backtracked on it, whatever they did.

420
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
That being said, I'm thankful that finally eight years later, we're finally getting a chance to play it.

421
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Unfortunately, even though it is on the Xbox One, it does look like you're kind of playing a Playstation 3 game,

422
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
something that you could probably play on the Nintendo Switch, because of the fact that it's eight years old.

423
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
But for the most part, that's where my gripes about the game itself kind of end.

424
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And it's not that an old game is necessarily bad or anything like that.

425
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
They couldn't remaster it.

426
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I mean, so many people will still be going back and playing Smash Brothers on the GameCube, because that's the best version, right?

427
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So I'm not saying just because it's older, it's a bad game.

428
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm just kind of saying, look, this is a side effect of y'all not trying this a lot sooner, is that now the game looks a little bit dated.

429
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I don't know if they did any remaster or anything like that, but in the closed beta, I didn't get a sense that it was top of the line.

430
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It looked like Playstation 3, which isn't bad. It doesn't look bad at all.

431
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
But anyway, I don't want to sound negative on it, because honestly, I'm really jazzed and I'm really excited about PSO2.

432
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It's like a faster version of Phantasy Star Online 1, and there's so many little tie-ins to the first game, a lot of similar areas.

433
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But then it kind of branches off and does its own thing, and it kind of takes everything and puts a different little spin on it, because the boss fights are very different.

434
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You can go into these fights now with like 20 people and take on a boss, as opposed to just like four, and it's pretty cool.

435
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And it's fast paced. It's very fast paced, which is a little bit jarring at first, but once you kind of get the hang of it, it's really fun.

436
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And so there's a lot about it, like I really like, and I'm excited for the game to release whenever they finally decide to do it.

437
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So, yeah. Looking in chat, DJ Rama S says, also the ratings on the PSO2 anime also helped with the game coming to the US.

438
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Pod Culture says, I thought it looked pretty good. Again, I'm not saying it looked bad. I'm just saying, when you wait this long, the game starts to look like a game that would have come out in 2012.

439
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It looks dated.

440
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah. So, let's see. Pod Culture says, yeah, Fastly Star Online 3 will probably come out in Japan soon.

441
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Well, I hope the beta test getting hammered so hard that the server is shut down or whatever.

442
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I hope this shows Sega, you know, that there is more interest in this type of stuff.

443
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And, you know, if they do have a PSO3 at some point, they put it out here a lot faster than they did PSO2.

444
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The beta test was fun. The only kind of like bummer with the beta test, the way it was set up,

445
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I don't understand why they showed that six ships were only going to be available and then they only opened two of them.

446
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So, like a bunch of us had planned to go to ship three.

447
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And since there wasn't communication about what that would actually...

448
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And I'm kind of surprised that they didn't think that part through, that people were going to be coordinating.

449
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Because they had talked about, oh, your characters are going to be able to carry over.

450
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And if you do all these different, you know, urgent events, you can get a Dreamcast mag, which is a highly desirable thing.

451
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And kind of made people burn through this content really fast.

452
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I almost like, I'm going to be honest, I kind of wish they hadn't said that the characters would carry over from beta.

453
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I kind of wish they said, we're going to nuke all your characters at the end of the beta.

454
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I don't think anyone would have held that against them.

455
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And I don't think, you know, because that's been done a lot of times in other betas.

456
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And then that way when the game does come out, like people can reorient what ship they want to be on or what server.

457
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And then can take their little time a little more with the content.

458
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Because they won't feel the need to rush for some type of limited, exclusive Dreamcast mag.

459
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Which they haven't defined. Is that even limited or exclusive?

460
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Or something they'll just end up selling in the cash shop.

461
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So, I don't know.

462
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And again, I hate to sound really gripey, but these are some beefs that need to be pointed out.

463
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Because I do think the way they rolled this out could have been improved a little bit.

464
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Even for something that's a beta.

465
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And you might be saying, well Rob, it's free. You didn't have to do anything for it.

466
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Well, still. I mean, you want to set the game up for success, right?

467
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Because we're cheering this game on.

468
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Because we've been waiting so fucking long for this to come out in the US.

469
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
We want to see it do well.

470
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So it does make some of those like, ooh, those winces of, ooh, I wish they'd done this a little better.

471
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It makes it a little bit more like, oh, I just wish this had been done different.

472
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But, anyway.

473
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Bobby Blackwolf, who I know has been playing a lot of PSO2, is elaborating in our chatroom saying,

474
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
it looks like they have things that you can only redeem once per account.

475
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So if they wiped your character, you'd lose those once per account things,

476
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
and they don't have the infrastructure to reverse that.

477
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Well, why not? Reversing it, I can't see.

478
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Because why don't they just issue everybody a new ID?

479
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Because you have that PSN ID or whatever that you pick a name for.

480
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I don't know. It seems like it shouldn't be that hard.

481
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But, again, maybe this is a drawback of 2012 infrastructure and quality of life in your MMO,

482
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
versus all the progress we've made in the last eight years.

483
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Which, hell yes, we've made a lot of progress in QOL in the last eight years.

484
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Just look at a game like Final Fantasy XIV and how far that's come in eight years.

485
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Well, that Switch port will fill right at home then.

486
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So, anyway. Just a thought.

487
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
But overall, again, I loved playing the fast-paced thing,

488
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and I'm excited to play this online with friends.

489
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And, yeah, it is free. So there is that.

490
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Hype Mayhem in chat says, too bad that PSO2 is only on consoles.

491
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
If it was on PC, I'd consider playing it.

492
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Well, good news, Hype Mayhem. Only the beta was on Xbox One.

493
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It will be coming out to Microsoft PCs.

494
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I think there's some sort of deal with Microsoft.

495
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Microsoft made it happen.

496
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I think it has to be a Windows 10 PC, so you can't use a different OS or something.

497
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I don't know.

498
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Because Microsoft, obviously some type of partnership or funding or something made it happen,

499
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
so it is going to be a Windows 10 game.

500
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
But most people are probably running that.

501
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Maybe it can be part of Games Pass.

502
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Sorry to be Mac fans, but Microsoft did kick out money.

503
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Games Pass?

504
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Well, it's a free game.

505
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I mean, if they put it on Game Pass, it would be a little bit redundant.

506
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Maybe Game Pass people can get...

507
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yeah, like they do on PlayStation Plus for Apex Legends.

508
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You get an extra skin and some coin.

509
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You know, things like that.

510
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So, there is that.

511
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Anyhow.

512
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Okay, that's my thoughts on Phantasy Star Online 2.

513
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So, we're going to move into some gaming news.

514
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
First, I do have some housekeeping to take care of.

515
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
As I've been saying for a couple weeks, we are not going to be here live

516
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
at the Voice Geeks Network on March 1st and March 8th.

517
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
That is due to myself being on a cruise, so we won't be having a show live those nights.

518
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
We are looking at having a show that we taped in advance that will air on March 1st,

519
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
and then we will probably just take the week of March 8th off.

520
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I don't know if one of my co-hosts might do an impromptu Twitch stream on their own channel in the interim,

521
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:25,000
but there will be no official OLR those weeks while I am tragically on a cruise ship in the Caribbean

522
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
hanging out with Star Trek fans.

523
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
What a tragedy.

524
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Anyway, no show March 1st, March 8th.

525
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Which is also my first cruise I'm going on as an adult.

526
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So, I know Bobby Black Wolf is cheering me on because I think Bobby Black Wolf really likes cruises.

527
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
He's gone on several, and I know the engagement happened on a Disney cruise.

528
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So, Bobby, I think, is very excited to hear all my cruise stories and what I think.

529
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I just hope I don't get seasick.

530
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Another piece of housekeeping I want to mention here towards the top of the show.

531
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You know, I always talk about towards the end of the show that we need to support independent broadcasting, right?

532
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Because, you know, indie broadcast and the folks that are in this, you know, because of the passion for it,

533
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
because of the love of this, we're all kind of like in this together, right?

534
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Because we don't necessarily have all the coin, all the dollars, all the eyes on a big website that's advertiser backed and so forth.

535
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You know, many of the independent audience does this out of the passion for it and out of the love for it and all of that.

536
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And, you know, obviously one pretty amazing example of this that's going to be hitting a milestone tonight that I want to kind of say congratulations to and tip my hat to

537
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
is the folks over at Gamertag Radio, led up by Godfrey, and I know Paris hosts that show as well,

538
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and I'm forgetting all the other names at the moment, but Godfrey and crew, I want to congratulate on 1000 episodes of Gamertag Radio.

539
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That's a huge milestone to hit 1000 episodes.

540
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Now, some of you might kind of, you know, I know some of you know that we have been around a very long time.

541
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,000
We do believe we are the longest running video game podcast because we kind of got the jump on everybody else since we started on Live 365

542
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
and then took the live thing into podcasting right away when podcasting became a thing.

543
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But you know what? Here's the thing when it comes to, well, for one, they hit 1000 episodes first

544
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
because they do multiple episodes a week sometimes, especially during E3 week and so forth.

545
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And I think this is another very important point, too, is that these types of successes should be celebrated.

546
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You know what I mean? Like, you know, when you go to the office, right?

547
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And let's say Karen in the finance department is celebrating 10 years with the company.

548
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So we're going to have cake today. Yeah, you don't see someone come into the office and go,

549
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
well, I don't know if it was really 10 years. Does the six months she was a temp count?

550
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You know, you don't do that because you celebrate those types of successes and things like that, right?

551
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
The more we celebrate and lift each other up, the more cake we all get to have. Right?

552
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So I just wanted to say congratulations and enjoy your cake over at GamerTag Radio.

553
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You guys definitely earned it. And honestly, it's a, you know, I've always kind of like encouraged

554
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:05,000
different voices and different people out there to get into podcasting because we need a diverse amount of voices out there.

555
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And I don't see Danny and GamerTag Radio and the folks over there as any type of like competition or anything like that

556
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
because our shows are really fucking different. Like they're really, really different.

557
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Yes. People know who he is. Whereas they don't know who we are. That's why he's got, was it the head of Microsoft?

558
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yeah, they have Phil Spencer. Yeah, Phil Spencer. We can't get Phil Spencer up in here. Let's be honest.

559
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Well, but here, here's, here's the challenge. Have we really tried? And so I'll give God for his ups on that.

560
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You don't know until you ask. He asked and asked and he got it. Good for him. That's great.

561
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I hope when we hit a thousand episodes, when we're like, they'll be like four years from now on our weekly type of path.

562
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I hope we're able to get somebody like, I would have loved to get Reggie Fils-Aime. I'll take Doug Bowser.

563
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I bet he'll be, he'll be settled in and ready to go then. Or, you know, whoever is running games.

564
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'll take Tommy Tallarico. We'll talk about Intellivision for hours. I'm fine with that. I like people who like games.

565
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
That's also why I really like Phil Spencer. We'll get a person that runs a parody account for one of these big CEOs.

566
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:23,000
That's also why I really like Phil Spencer. And I kind of give him props too for doing this show because a lot of, uh, corporate gaming stuff really turns their nose up at podcasts and that whole thing.

567
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Um, because podcasts unfortunately have that reputation of, Oh, what do you call four white dudes in their thirties in their basement on a Friday nights, a podcast, you know?

568
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And I think those jokes are stupid and I think we should be inviting more people. We should be inviting more voices to this.

569
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And so as I was saying, you know, uh, Gamertag Radio, they do a lot of like Xbox kind of focus things of the year. Not to say they're only about that.

570
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Um, but they just play, they talk about different types of games. They play different types of games.

571
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
They, we talked a shit ton about Dance Dance Revolution on this show back in the day.

572
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I don't think that's necessarily a game they got into over there, but I don't think we talk a lot about Halo and some of the big Xbox franchise.

573
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
We'll just get them hooked on Orna then their progress will slow down. It's fine, you know?

574
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yes. We're going to, we're going to send a mole over to Gamertag Radio. We're going to send a zit over to Gamertag Radio and just be like, have you guys checked out a game called Orna on the cell phone? It's really good.

575
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Yeah. And then, no, but there's, there's places we overlap too. You know how, um, you know how they started? Um, not, not like the, the pre-Gamertag Radio stuff that Danny was doing before.

576
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
His original love was Phantasy Star Online. And he had like a Phantasy Star Online radio thing.

577
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
How, how wonderful for them to launch the beta in time for his...

578
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Well, it's funny because when he talked about PSO2, I actually kind of sent him a direct message out of the blue and I said, I was kind of like laughing to myself because I'm like, Hey, you know what?

579
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I think I see an area here where like our shows actually kind of have something in common that we both love Phantasy Star Online. And that's a, and that's a great thing. Let's celebrate that.

580
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So anyway, uh, anyway, I've talked at length about that, but I really want to congratulate those guys on 1000 episodes and, and another, another big difference.

581
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And why, you know, because again, folks have asked, well, since you guys are on longer, didn't you hit a thousand episodes first or, you know, things like that.

582
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I, I, I don't know. I mean, this is episode number 809. And yes, we, we used to put out two episodes a week cause we take the live show and split it up as a podcast.

583
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But again, um, I'm not interested in crapping on their success. I want to have cake. So let's celebrate it. Right.

584
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And to be fair, you know, what we do, we are a live show. We've always been a live show. And then we kind of take that live show, crop it and put it on the podcast feed. Right.

585
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:55,000
That's how we do things. Okay. That's not the way they always do things. I think they do some things that may be like kind of live and, you know, but a lot of their episodes are edited and like put into a package and all that.

586
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:04,000
No, thanks. I don't have time for that. I don't have time to edit this show. And that's not the type of show. I'm not saying it's a bad show. Absolutely not saying that it's just not the show I'm doing.

587
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So again, a great creative difference between us. And honestly, if you took the time to edit 1000 episodes, I fucking applaud you. Like that is, that is work. That is a lot of work.

588
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And I think people don't realize how much work that is. So anyhow. Yeah. Bobby is in our chat saying Danny's first show on life through CC five was PSO radio. So he's in heaven this weekend.

589
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh, I'm sure. Absolutely. Of course. Bobby Blackwell suggesting to bring on Jason Enos. You know, funny to talk about, not just DDR, but now he's like the VP over it in television.

590
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So that really would be, we can have both. Why not just one person from intelligent can come on this show any fucking time. He likes, you see the seat right here. That's, that's the Jason honorary seat right there.

591
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:04,000
He come on this show anytime he wants. And, uh, we'll, we'll be happy to have him. He can even nap on that couch, which I have napped on many times when it was at my house, he actually would have been on the show.

592
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:15,000
About 10 years ago, if I hadn't completely fucked up the recording at E3. And that was, that was a learning experience. You know, that was a well shit, you know, type of thing. Hey, it happens to the best of us.

593
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:28,000
We've all learned something from the ups and the downs and so forth. Right. And isn't that what life's all about? It is, it is learning things. So, uh, active says editing anything is hard time consuming work. Hell yeah, it is. It really is.

594
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So, all right. Anyway, big congratulations. And, uh, their thousandth episode comes out tonight and they are interviewing Phil Spencer. I'm not expecting any like bombshell news announcements. I suppose you never know, but I do know that Phil Spencer strikes me as the type of CEO that actually plays games.

595
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And we've talked about this on the show before and is actually enthusiastic about games and actually, um, like is in kind of tune with gamers. You know, I think he's really got that more so than the guy he took over for, for sure.

596
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Um, so I'm just excited to hear him talk to fans about games and loving games. And that's kind of how we started the show off tonight on a positive note. Right. So I hope their thousandth episode is just fucking celebrating video games. It's a great thing.

597
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Yes. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. And, uh, we're gonna talk about some gaming news tonight and we're going to start, we're different sometimes, right? We're gonna start with a Sony story. Let's do it. Our first headline tonight about Sony.

598
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So Sony has put up their official page for the PlayStation five and kind of even right before that GameStop had put up their pre-order page for the PlayStation five. And there was another retailer who also put up their pre-order page for PlayStation five.

599
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
You mean retailers want to take my money right now?

600
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Right. They do. But I mean, the fact that they're doing that now is leads me to believe that maybe they know that there's an announcement forthcoming.

601
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Um, so we will have to wait and see what, when that is, but I mean, it's not a surprise that, you know, that there's going to be an announcement at some point soon.

602
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So we'll just have to wait and see when it is and what it is. And I don't know, in the meantime, we can stare at this webpage that has really nothing there other than the PlayStation five is coming and launches holiday 20.

603
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Stare at that lovely PlayStation five logo. See if, see, I'm sure people are tearing this website apart, digging up the code, looking for hidden links, looking for any type of a thing that might give some hints away, but I guess nothing has turned up so far.

604
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And you can even sign up on their mailing list.

605
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But you know, the thing about those mailing lists always cracks me up, like the sign up for our mailing list thing, because no matter what it is, it's always on Twitter five minutes before that email goes out.

606
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Right. Pretty much. Name a time when a mailing list actually broke a news story.

607
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Once in a great while, I would say the when even when that happens, the email immediately ends up on Twitter.

608
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Exactly. But, you know, the way if you want to talk about a recent story where an email broke a news story, that would be because they didn't really want it to be a news story, but they wanted everybody that was affected by it to know about it.

609
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And that was when the ESA announced that, hey, our data has been breached.

610
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
How'd you like to lose some personal data? There was that wasn't there. Correct.

611
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
All right. But that's the point, you know, because no one reads emails that much.

612
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It's a perfect way to just tell people without announcing it to the world.

613
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Any predictions on how this PlayStation five roll out is going to go down? I have no idea.

614
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I have a prediction. Sure. It's all going to happen on the two weeks we're not here.

615
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Because if I've learned anything in the damn near 18 years of doing this program, it's all going to happen when we're fucking not here.

616
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Yeah. And I can't even tweet because I'll be on a fucking boat.

617
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Rob, what? I will do all the Twittering for you. Thank you. Appreciate that.

618
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Do you have the OLR log in info? I hope so. Words.

619
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Anyway, it's some letters and numbers and maybe a special character.

620
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
All strong passwords should be, shouldn't they? All right. And, you know, you have to sacrifice a chicken.

621
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Anyway, PlayStation five news coming probably soon. I would imagine March would be like the latest.

622
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
We're going to hear about it. But yeah, anything. They could go all the way to June.

623
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I mean, even who cares? I don't even care when they announce it at this point.

624
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Just just let the launch titles be good and strong and let the console be great.

625
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
That's all I really want. The announcement, whatever. All right.

626
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Moving on to talk about Twitch and Amazon. And this isn't news specifically about Twitch, per se.

627
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But it's a little bit about what's happening because Amazon purchased Twitch several years ago.

628
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Yeah. Right. And so what can that do to boost Amazon and have Twitch kind of boost Amazon in the portfolio?

629
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Well, there was a report out there that indicates that Amazon might have some ideas on making money by selling Twitch's streaming technology to other companies.

630
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Similar to how Amazon Web Services or AWS was the thing that was used internally in Amazon.

631
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And now like AWS, like so many websites.

632
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So I'm going to be able to tune in to ring doorbells or like whatever, you know, doorbell feeds or private security cameras.

633
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Well, I would think maybe some of the things we traditionally know as cable channels might be the type of thing that end up going online, powered by a technology similar to Twitch.

634
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I mean, after all, one of my favorite Twitch channels, and I'm sad it's gone, was that buzzer, the one that ran all the old game shows.

635
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But for whatever reason, they pulled the plug on it. Probably still the Bob Ross channel, right?

636
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yeah, but even the Bob Ross channel only really runs Monday nights on special occasions. It doesn't run 24-7.

637
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Yeah, well, I mean, you know, sometimes too much of a good thing might kind of like wear it out.

638
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I think they wanted it to be kind of a special thing.

639
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
They should do something like ALF or something.

640
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
You want an ALF streaming channel?

641
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Yeah, just because I don't really want to watch it, but, you know, it would be fun to tune in for a little bit.

642
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Now, some folks are wondering if Amazon might be making a move like this because Twitch isn't bringing in the level of revenue that Amazon was hoping for.

643
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So apparently Amazon brought in about, excuse me, Twitch brought in about $300 million, that's still a lot of money, to Amazon in 2019, but the forecast was $500 to $600 million.

644
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So I don't know why the bar was set so high. I don't know if losing some of the personality competition caused that, but I just, maybe, that just sounds like maybe really aggressive. I don't know.

645
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So maybe Twitch needs to explore other ways to be able to be profitable, although that means, you know, you guys spending more of your money.

646
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But I like the idea of like tie-ins with games to like click here now to add to your Amazon cart and things like that.

647
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And I realize that kind of exists to an extent, but like the technology isn't there for me to like update something like as we're going and as we're talking about a certain game.

648
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Like when we talk about Wonderful 101, click here now to, well, I guess that's a Kickstarter, not a Amazon thing, but still something akin to that, right?

649
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,000
We talk about a game. I should be able to like update something where you can click now in order to buy it if you want or something like that, you know?

650
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And it's a little hard to do on the way the structure is right now. But then again, I also realize we're a niche thing. We're not Ninja or anything like that. You know, it's very different. I don't know.

651
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,000
So anyway, no idea what the timetable looks like or even if Amazon is actually going to do it.

652
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,000
But this is something that could be helping Twitch make some money for Amazon in the near future.

653
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:53,000
So it could be interesting because who knows what other gaming companies maybe would want to grab onto something like this for their own type of broadcast thing.

654
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I don't know. I would just think everyone would just use Twitch. I can't imagine that like we really need another platform dedicated to something.

655
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Okay, I'm gonna put my tinfoil hat on because you know who I think would do it if they were able to like make their own type of thing that wasn't just embedded within Twitch? Nintendo.

656
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I do. I don't know why. I wouldn't watch it. I don't know. Oh, please. Oh, please. So many people tuned into those Nintendo Directs.

657
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,000
There are huge things. The treehouse lives and everything that they do. I don't understand why you would need your own platform. Just put it to be branded.

658
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Brand your own goddamn page. You don't need to have like your own separate platform that's basically the same thing. Stop. I don't know. I kind of think I just see Nintendo as the company.

659
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Of course they would because if it's got to be difficult, it's got to be Nintendo. Seriously. No. Let's do things differently and also a decade behind.

660
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I swear to God. Let's move on. Dark Sakura.

661
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Whale. Everyone is losing their shit over a virus.

662
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I'm sure everyone is seen on the news though on coronavirus specifically that particular strain because hello people.

663
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:21,000
The common cold is a coronavirus that's massive and multiple tiered and the flu kills more people.

664
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Now that I've been preaching about that. Can I jump in, though? Because I mean, like I understand, like, yes, the media and a lot of social media and people are kind of like running away with it and acting all crazy.

665
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And especially people that want to like make jokes that are that are rooted in racism. Very racist. Like that. That's all shitty.

666
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And I'm totally on board with that. But like I also there's also part of me that's like but the way they've been able to contain it as well as they have is because they're taking it seriously and because there is that type of alarm.

667
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And because there are folks that are working very hard, disease center controls and things like that that are, you know, working hard to prevent this from getting worse.

668
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Yeah. But at the same time, people shouldn't the every day average person doesn't need to freak out about it.

669
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I'm on board with that.

670
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:31,000
OK. You're not going to have the cross contamination meat that's give that originated this virus and your next door neighbor who might be from some Asian country isn't going to magically sneeze Wuhan coronavirus on you because thinking that is racist as fuck.

671
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I agree with all that. But I think it is also good to remind the general human population no matter where you are. Please wash your hands after you poop.

672
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So this isn't this isn't the ancient Chinese secret that I've been hearing about. No, that's Calgon.

673
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Oh, but I think I think good good hygiene is a good thing to practice. Please wash your hands after you poop.

674
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Yes. At any rate, of course, it has been, though, affecting the technology industry pretty crazily because a lot of manufacturing is done in China and in Taiwan.

675
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Now, I'll go ahead and also say this. One of my friends was supposed to be going to Taiwan this week and her flight to Hong Kong actually got canceled due to this as well.

676
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:23,000
She had to reschedule. But I am. It's also affecting things like shipping and travel and all of that.

677
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:36,000
The crews I'm about to go on. They sent out an email that says, we're sorry, but if you have travel plans that have put you in China 15 days before the cruise, we're not going to be able to have you on the cruise.

678
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Please talk to us about rescheduling, you know, a very nice customer service email.

679
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
But it's just like, hey, sorry, but we have you know, it's affecting like a lot of stuff and including video games.

680
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Well, and of course, one of the biggest companies affected by that right now is Nintendo.

681
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:57,000
They actually have a statement on how on the Web site about how this is affecting their workflow.

682
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And I'll read the quote. We can confirm the manufacturing of some Nintendo products for the Japanese market has been delayed due to the impact of 2019 and COVID coronavirus outbreak.

683
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Nintendo does not anticipate a significant impact on our broader global supply systems and accessories at this time and product sales in North America and Europe, including preorders are not affected.

684
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,000
We'd like to express our concern and support for all of those affected by the coronavirus during this challenging time.

685
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Also, a private division publisher say that they are delaying outer worlds on Nintendo Switch due to the impact to the Virtuos team working on the port to give them enough time to finish development.

686
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And they will be releasing a physical version on cartridge.

687
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:49,000
So any other any basically everyone's like, oh, our teams are fine, but all this other stuff is happening.

688
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:56,000
No word from Sony or anything from Microsoft yet.

689
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:06,000
People have requested they haven't said anything. But again, as I brought up a few weeks ago, the sales of Plague Inc have been skyrocketing.

690
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And nothing about how this is going to affect the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.

691
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And so, yeah.

692
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Well, and hopefully at the end of the day, the measures that they are taking do really help prevent the spread of this.

693
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Have they said if it's one of those things like H1N1 or what was called the swine flu, where it got weaker as it went on?

694
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I haven't seen anything about that. I'd have to look back into it.

695
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
That was my hope.

696
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:44,000
But I do know that the origination of this apparently came from cross-contamination due to people mixing bat meat.

697
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Oh, wow.

698
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Yeah. Into you know, that it was getting into like the butchering or something or in the grinding of the meat, that it was very poor conditions where the meat was being processed.

699
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And of course, some people were eating it and bats themselves.

700
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I mean, I love bats. They're cute. Don't get me wrong.

701
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
They serve a purpose in this world, especially in America, that they do carry rabies pretty badly.

702
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And they are very prone to carrying disease that do not affect their population, but are highly terrible.

703
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:22,000
That's not what I'm quite thinking of, but highly communicable if ingested or if they're bitten, if a human is bitten by them.

704
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
So including rabies, including other bloodborne illnesses.

705
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
It's one of those things where it's like feline AIDS.

706
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And what we know as humans is the AIDS virus are very, very different and they are not actually the same thing.

707
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,000
There are similarities, but like you cannot get that from a cat and a cat cannot get that from you.

708
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Right. I think we're, I hope we're all educated on how that all works now.

709
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
It's far more communicable among cats, between cats than humans.

710
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Just saying, especially, you know, you can't give prep to cats.

711
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
True.

712
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
You know, just saying.

713
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Anyway, so...

714
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Not yet anyway.

715
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

716
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
But at any rate, back to this.

717
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
So there's going to be some delays.

718
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Keep your eyes out on not just the console area of things, but look in your other technology as well for other distributors.

719
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And major manufacturing is done in that whole APAC region, Asia Pacific region.

720
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
So, there you go.

721
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And, you know, as frustrating as it might be to see some things get delayed and such as a result, have some fucking understanding.

722
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Like, put things in perspective.

723
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:40,000
At least you weren't on that cruise ship that they had to all sit there for two weeks and wait it out, you know, or you're in the city of Wuhan,

724
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:47,000
which, you know, apparently life is very different there right now because of, you know, how isolated it is and so forth.

725
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
So just be glad it ain't that.

726
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And Questbuster does make a good point. I'll just read the quote here.

727
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:01,000
One thing I noticed when I traveled in China is that you have high-tech cities mixed in with extremely rural open-air markets that sell ellipsis anything.

728
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
So...

729
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Alright.

730
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Well, let's move on. Let's talk about some other gaming headlines in the week. Loki.

731
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Yeah, so there was this streaming service that Nvidia is putting out that they finally have made live.

732
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It's basically their, I guess, not really an answer to Stadia or Xcla or something like that.

733
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:33,000
But what you're able to do with this is actually stream games to different devices that you may have in other libraries.

734
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
So they're not actually providing the games like you would with Stadia.

735
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It's basically using, like, your Steam, Epic, good ol' games and Blizzard accounts to link those together to be able to stream some of the games you have purchased there to those devices.

736
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So I don't know what compatible games they have available right now.

737
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I wanted to check it out, but sadly they do not have iPhone support. It's only Android support.

738
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I could have borrowed Alan's tablet maybe, and maybe I will still do that during the week, but I wasn't extremely motivated once I heard I couldn't use my own phone to do it.

739
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
But I love the idea that it connects to games that you already own, so I'm like, buy them again.

740
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Because I have quite the library.

741
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I know, I know you do.

742
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
That would have been nice if Stadia used the Steam account.

743
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Well, it's interesting to see that other, you know, I don't think a lot of us have talked very seriously about NVIDIA being a big player in games and so forth.

744
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,000
But I mean, certainly this is one of those things you look at and then you kind of go, well, why doesn't Google do something like that?

745
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
This is going to be...

746
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Yeah, so they're saying, though, for bandwidth, what you would need to kind of run this, they say 50 megabits down for the best experience.

747
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:53,000
They're recommending 30 megabits down for 1080 at 60 frames per second, or 15 megabits down for 720 at 60 frames per second.

748
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
So that's not all that bad.

749
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I mean, honestly, I'm not really sure how that compares with Stadia, but it doesn't seem too demanding.

750
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Right now, you can check it out with a free account, which will allow you to play an hour at a time.

751
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And then, of course, it'll be queued if it's busy.

752
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Otherwise, if you pay $5 a month, you'll get up to six hours of gameplay at a time, ray tracing in games that are streamed to your device, priority access.

753
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Interesting. I do kind of want to check it out since I do own Android devices and other devices that are not as powerful.

754
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I have a Surface that would be fun to stream stuff to. Maybe my son wants to play a game or something like that.

755
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yeah. I'll have to check it out.

756
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Well, moving on to talk about another game coming out from Valve, or excuse me, that's out from Valve called, of course, Counter-Strike GO.

757
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I think Counter-Strike's kind of a, or CS GO, for sure. I don't know, but Counter-Strike GO, obviously, there's a very popular franchise and so forth.

758
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
This is a new moderation system for the game that's going to really change things a little bit.

759
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Because if you are somebody that is consistently getting reported for abuse, even beyond an initial warning, so let's say you get warned and players are continuing to report you.

760
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Well, what's going to happen? You will be muted by default. So when you go into other games, people are just not going to hear you.

761
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
You'll be screaming at nothing because you have been muted by default.

762
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Now, players can voluntarily unmute you, so you can't say that you're being robbed of being able to play with friends and stuff like that,

763
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:49,000
because people can still unmute you as they wish, but if you have continued to get complaints about you after you've already been warned, you'll be muted by default.

764
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Until, now, you're not going to carry this, you know, badge of shame forever, you can earn some XP, and once you earn enough XP, you will get rid of the penalty.

765
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:08,000
In announcing this, the Counter-Strike GO team said, because the new system is driven by reports, it lets players establish their own standards for communication,

766
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,000
and ensure that their fellow players receive anonymous feedback when they're out of line.

767
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Don't know how I feel about that, because I feel like that leaves the, we're going to let our players establish the standards. It feels like it leads the door wide open.

768
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I don't want responsibility, Valve.

769
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
We don't want to pay anybody to moderate. We're going to let the community have a side.

770
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Why would we do that? It's worked so well on our store platforms, just letting every, let the community moderate that. That's worked out great.

771
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So that's where this news story gets a little bit like, ooh.

772
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
But you know, when you look at it though, it's really not that strange. It's totally a page out of the Valve playbook.

773
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:53,000
You know, fuck our responsibility. We'll give you the tools and you guys build your fucking structure.

774
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Now, Valve is not saying how many reports you have to get before you get a warning, but they will say that those who play frequently and don't report often, they carry more weight.

775
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,000
So if you're somebody that goes on and reports three people in every game, your report doesn't weigh as much as somebody who very rarely reports people.

776
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Because it's one of those things where it's like, oh, well, if you rarely report people, then you must only do it when it's really bad.

777
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
That also doesn't make any sense.

778
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I know it's like this secret formula.

779
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
That doesn't make any sense because that's like.

780
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Like the fucking KFC recipe.

781
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,000
That's almost like, you know how, remember they have the YouTube moderator groups or whatever that were supposed to like review content and stuff.

782
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
So they're penalizing you for doing their job.

783
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And they do go on to say accounts that generate no XP or, and they have spam reports or something like that.

784
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
They will have little to no impact.

785
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,000
So very interesting to see how this all boils out with this magical formula that Valve's created.

786
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But, um, I don't know. I, it just, I feel like there's going to be a follow up to this very soon about how this was abused to mute certain players.

787
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So we'll see.

788
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I can't wait.

789
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I just hope that isn't it because I just, I feel like I see the punch line.

790
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I'm using my quotey fingers again.

791
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I'm using those a lot tonight.

792
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I feel like I see the punch line to this coming.

793
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:15,000
And it's going to be that like somebody whose voice should be lifted in a multiplayer gaming circle is going to instead get silenced.

794
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And I really, really hope that doesn't happen here.

795
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
But I'm just going to say if we're reporting on this again in six months, I'm not exactly going to be surprised.

796
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
But I guess we'll wait till then.

797
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
In the meantime, maybe we'll be surprised.

798
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
It'll take that long.

799
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
In the meantime, let's talk about a pleasant surprise, an actual pleasant surprise.

800
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Dark Cyber.

801
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
This is something that is definitely a little bit happier in news.

802
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:48,000
And we hinted at this when we had our come over from Bobby, when he handed the reins back to us.

803
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:57,000
There is going to be a Western release of Double Dragon and Kunio-kun Retro Brawler collection.

804
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:04,000
That is a PS4 Nintendo Switch collection going to be out on February 20th.

805
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:14,000
It was released in Japan as Kunio-kun, the world classics collection, has basically a series of 18 games from that series,

806
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
including three of the NES versions of the Double Dragon games and a bunch of the Kunio games.

807
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:28,000
What's going to be the big thing about this, though, is that a lot of the Kunio-kun games are actually never,

808
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:36,000
they're never localized versions, 11 of them that have not been their original localized versions.

809
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
So we are going to be getting, so while we had River City Ransom and that will be included,

810
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
we also get Nikketsu Downtown Story, you know, so that's going to be one of them.

811
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
That's amazing. 11 games getting localized for the first time. That's amazing.

812
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,000
That's great. I mean, a lot of these, I mean, shoot, we had to import some of the ones or romp them.

813
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
There's probably ROM patches out there somewhere, yeah.

814
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:06,000
For sure. But as far as the list, hold on, I just had that list a moment ago.

815
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
This is terrible because now the list doesn't want to pull up. OK.

816
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Yeah, it's not showing me the list of them, but I mean, there was like, you know, Super Dodge or not Super Dodgeball,

817
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
but, you know, Dodgeball. We had like the hockey games.

818
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:31,000
We had Nikketsu Fighting Legend. Just a lot of those on there.

819
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:39,000
But I mean, Nikketsu High School Dodgeball was what we had a Super Dodgeball and, you know, Renegade and crashing the boys.

820
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Is the drummer a boy too? No, sorry. I love that movie. But yeah, so it's going to be really sweet.

821
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Dan and I are pretty excited about that, you know, and barf.

822
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Heck yeah. No, this is great. It's again, it's one of those things where it's like this.

823
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I wish we'd gotten localized versions of more of these games a long time ago,

824
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
but I'll take what we can get. Maybe, maybe that collection of mana and trials of mana.

825
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Second, it's a three finally being localized after all these years. Maybe that set off some interesting trend.

826
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I don't know. I don't know what it is about all these older games suddenly getting localized, but I'm here for it.

827
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
It's about time. The big thing I think is that they're realizing is that, well,

828
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
you can't keep things hidden from us, not with the Internet, the world we live in now.

829
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
We're way too connected. I mean.

830
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I mean, people get pissed off when stuff doesn't get localized now, you know,

831
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,000
or at least some kind of translation for it. So.

832
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I'm excited. I'm pretty happy about it.

833
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I think there's arcade versions on this, too. Yeah, I believe so. That is correct.

834
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Quest Buster says, Yeah, this sounds pretty wild. Great to see this coming out.

835
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Big thing is we're willing to give them money to play these. I mean, we always have.

836
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:01,000
So, yeah, they need to keep that in mind. So, well, you know, and we need to make sure we do give money when these games come out.

837
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I know I'll be buying it. I'm very excited about that. I love I love retro games.

838
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I love the idea of playing some of these Kunio-kun games that I have never gotten to play before because I'm just I'm quite frankly,

839
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
too lazy to deal with ROM translation patches and all that stuff.

840
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I think I only ever did that to play second. It's a two three the first time and Final Fantasy five.

841
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I think that I think I remember that from years ago.

842
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I don't know how many of you guys were old enough to remember that when Final Fantasy five was a translation patch.

843
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It was a big deal. I had my my ROM forever with butts.

844
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Yeah. Wasn't his name completely different? Yeah.

845
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:41,000
This is like Batsu. But you could say Bart's or butts or Batsu.

846
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
So, yeah, I think like after a while, one of my later times playing it through,

847
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I ended up just naming him Batsu like in rival schools.

848
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
So. All right.

849
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I'm moving on. Let's go to a couple more stories before we get to the classic game of the week.

850
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,000
We'll get to that in a minute. All right. Let's talk about how generous EA is.

851
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,000
They've decided that they're going to go ahead and raise the prices of a bunch of their games on the steam storefront.

852
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
These games, if you're in the US, you might not know it's a price hike.

853
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,000
But in other regions like UK, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico and other regions,

854
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:29,000
you're seeing price hikes, even some of them more than double the original price.

855
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:36,000
No reasons have been given so far as to why these have been increased because they want you to still use origin.

856
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:42,000
As I say, it should be noted that origin still the lower price, but.

857
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:48,000
OK, just wait for a sale. But for those of you that must have it on steam, you can just pay more for it,

858
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
because that's what they're deciding to do in this case. Wait for a sale.

859
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Yeah. Just don't give them your money. Rip cycled in chat says, reminding everyone to hate EA.

860
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Don't like really need to remind you, but it's, you know, it just for in case you forgot for some unless you needed more reasons.

861
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Yeah. Well, I mean, I can also kind of see I mean, like from a completely like corporate perspective,

862
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I do understand why you would want to price it lower on your own store. It's just not a good look.

863
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Yeah, especially when it's like double. I mean, like maybe a 10 percent or a five dollar difference or something like I get that.

864
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,000
But double. Mm hmm. It's crazy. All right.

865
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Well, let's talk about steam of a different type. And this was a story that was actually posted in our discord.

866
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
So sometimes you guys share stories with us on our discord server and we read some of them on the show.

867
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
So I do want to invite you all to join us on discord over at vog network dot com.

868
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,000
That's VOG network dot com slash discord. That'll get you the invite that you need to get on our discord server.

869
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
And we had a link posted about this story about steam China.

870
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And I didn't even realize that there was like a unique version of steam coming out in China,

871
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
which this article gets into is mostly like it sounds like it's a good thing,

872
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:11,000
but what's actually happening might not be so good because apparently as it is right now,

873
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
steam is a bit of a loophole in that firewall that China has.

874
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,000
You guys have all probably heard about this, right? That China has this big firewall that a lot of websites are blocked.

875
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And you can't get into things like Google, Facebook, Twitch. So you can't watch the show in China live.

876
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I don't even know if you can get the podcast, but who knows? But you can use steam.

877
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:41,000
So for many people, you can get into things like Grand Theft Auto five player, unknown battlegrounds and all this stuff.

878
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:48,000
But now if steam China becomes a thing, you won't necessarily be able to get into these things.

879
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It's only going to be able to sell games that are approved by China's licensing and censorship policies.

880
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:01,000
And the group that may suffer the most from this, indie developers in China, of which there's not a ton of them.

881
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
It's kind of a different way it's all set up there just because of the culture and so forth.

882
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:16,000
But China's indie scene would suffer because they may not have the resources to put their games through this type of review system to get approved.

883
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:25,000
So while a localized version of steam might sound like a great thing, it is interesting to kind of see the other side of this.

884
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Now, DJ Powers from Valve in an interview with Eurogamer said that nothing will change regards to steam being available in China.

885
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And that kind of went on to elaborate that the goal of this is to make sure the players will still have access to the library of games that they've got.

886
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:49,000
But some developers are saying steam China is terrifying. It's horrible. I'm not sure it'll be but I hope players can still access international steam.

887
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:56,000
If steam wasn't available, we wouldn't be doing this. I think that's probably the case for most developers in China.

888
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:02,000
So we'll see what develops with the launch of that and how it might affect the industry over there in China.

889
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:09,000
All right. Well, let's take a trip down memory lane. And this is the part of the show where we're going to visit. We're going to visit a classic.

890
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,000
We're going to visit something from the past, something that you can't get on steam. Actually, maybe a version of this.

891
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Maybe not anymore.

892
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Maybe not anymore. But anyway, we're going to visit the classic game of the week.

893
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Or as we are doing in the year 2020, once a month Dark Soccer is going to pick a pinball table that she thinks, hey, you guys should be knocking balls around to this.

894
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Yep.

895
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
So Dark Soccer, what is the classic-

896
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Rub these shiny metal balls.

897
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:43,000
But I do like, and before I hit the B roll on this, I do like that you picked something where this is the game being played in like pinball arcade, I think.

898
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I did because the sound was cleaner.

899
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Yeah, it is. And it kind of does go to show there's a, even if nothing matches the experience of playing real pinball, in a pinch, it'll get the fix in a little bit, something like this.

900
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:05,000
So the game that I picked sticking with the John Papa Duke theme from last month is Theater of Magic.

901
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:10,000
And before I go into Theater of Magic, I have a very special thing about this game.

902
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I bought one from a coworker in the Bay Area in pristine condition that had some mods.

903
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I'll be talking a little bit about some of the mods for it.

904
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
But Dan and I bought this on our 13th wedding anniversary.

905
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And so he's added something into the little splash screen that has happy 13th anniversary for us.

906
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
So this particular one is very special to us.

907
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And it's also our dear friend Melody's favorite pinball.

908
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And if we hadn't bought it, I think she would have bought it.

909
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
So I've been trying to find her one too.

910
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:55,000
At any rate, Theater of Magic was designed by John Papa Duke, produced by Midway under the Bally name.

911
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And it's released on March 28th, 1995.

912
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And with artwork done by Linda Deal, programming by Jeff Johnson, music and sound effects done by Dave Zabriskie.

913
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
There were 6,600 units in its production run.

914
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
The game has a series of four objectives.

915
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Each one has to be completed to qualify for the wizard mode grand finale.

916
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
So you have theater, where you spell theater by shooting the left loop, one letter per shot.

917
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
And it begins a hurry up countdown.

918
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Multiball, so you shoot the ramp to spell magic, one letter per shot.

919
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Then lock two balls by shooting the inner loop.

920
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
And then hit the magic trunk to begin theater multiball.

921
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
My magic trunk is also kind of modded.

922
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
You can get aftermarket ones that are this harder rubber that doesn't crack.

923
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Mine actually has like a chain around it.

924
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I kind of dig the little just, you know, aesthetic mod.

925
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Anyway, next one you have Midnight Madness.

926
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
So you repeat shots to the right loop to advance the clock one hour at a time starting from noon.

927
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Once it reaches midnight, midnight madness round begins.

928
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:05,000
The clock running backwards in the shots to the magic trunk awarding points based on the hour that it shows.

929
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:12,000
The clock can be advanced with a skill shot or as a reward for sending the ball into the basement when the right ramp is raised.

930
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Then you have illusions.

931
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Number one is tiger saw.

932
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
My tiger saw is modified again to where it spins the saw on it.

933
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
So it's pretty cool.

934
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
You have levitating woman.

935
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
You have the trunk escape, spirit card, safe escape, metamorphosis, straight jacket, and hat trick.

936
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I'm not going to go into how to do all of those.

937
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Y'all can play the game.

938
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And then the grand finale will require you to make 12 ramp or loop shots within 60 seconds in order to spell magic theater and collect 500 million points.

939
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
A little bit more technicality about the game.

940
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
It uses the DCS sound system.

941
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
It also, to get a little bit more into it.

942
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Hold on just take me a moment.

943
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:05,000
It looks like that Bally also released 29 different machines in general.

944
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Starting in 1860.

945
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
So theater magic has been used for a while.

946
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Some of the other contemporaries of this one would be Black Rose.

947
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Which I also own Black Rose.

948
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Party Zone Corvette Doctor Who.

949
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:33,000
So this is another upright standard table.

950
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And it's really considered I would say one of the best.

951
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I mean this is like when a lot of people are asked what's your favorite pinball.

952
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Freaking theater of magic is right up on the top of their list.

953
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
So a little bit more than going into the video game forum.

954
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
As we are seeing we are looking at a version.

955
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I believe this is the pinball arcade version of the pinball effects one.

956
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
It is pinball arcade.

957
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Okay.

958
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:11,000
So yes so it was on pinball arcade as a license table until June 30th 2018 due to the WMS license expiration.

959
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It is available now in pinball FX3.

960
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:21,000
So and then there are unlicensed versions that were available for visual pinball and windows.

961
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:31,000
But at any rate this is again one of the I would just say top tier pinballs that you could get your hands on.

962
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
And now one of my top five for sure.

963
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,000
This one will on average set you back about six grand or more depending.

964
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,000
We thankfully got mine for like 45 or 46 something like that.

965
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And then I pay like another 300 for like an entire ramp replacement set and two extra trunks.

966
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Both again are aftermarket.

967
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,000
But they were I think one of them is from Germany that had like a hard rubber shell on it.

968
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Really nice.

969
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:06,000
You can still find other manufacturers now who are reproducing the ramp sets.

970
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Also, this one will work with the color D and D, which actually looks really, really good with it.

971
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
The effects in this game, the music, the voices.

972
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
It really is an immersive experience when it comes to pinball.

973
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
So there you go.

974
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And another endorsement in our chat from YY are saying, can I just say this table is sublime.

975
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I've had the pleasure of playing it on real table several times.

976
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It's fast paced.

977
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
The goals are super fun.

978
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
The rotating trunk is super cool.

979
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
The ramps are fun to shoot.

980
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
The sports get super high.

981
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Basically, everything about it is great.

982
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Highly recommended.

983
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I will tell you one thing about this, though, is a point.

984
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:51,000
And mostly because of the things that YY said, it actually is not usually used as a tournament table because of the point systems.

985
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And the rule sets are not very friendly for tournament play.

986
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:03,000
So that's why when we host league, I mean, theater, honestly, enough kind of gets ignored except by the people who play.

987
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Classic pinball table of the month.

988
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Great pick here.

989
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Theater of magic.

990
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
And don't worry, you might hear a Doctor Who come up in future months.

991
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
We've got 12 months in the year.

992
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
We've got 12 months and I have 13 pinballs in my house.

993
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
So I'm not doing all the ones that I own.

994
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Oh, and I remember now I was going to mention the pinball tables they had at the actual 80s place that I went.

995
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So they have the Munsters table, which I saw it looks like that's pretty new.

996
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Oh, the new one, yeah.

997
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Is it the black and white one or the color one?

998
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I, you mean like the screen on it?

999
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
No, the whole thing.

1000
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
They have a black and white limited edition.

1001
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
No, it's in color.

1002
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Does it have the interplay field?

1003
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I don't know.

1004
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
There's a color one at the coin op downtown.

1005
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I played the, when I first played Munsters, I played the special edition that's got like a mini little pinball inside of it set into the thing.

1006
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
And you play with like teeny tiny like ball bearing size pinballs.

1007
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
It's adorable.

1008
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
That's cute.

1009
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
What else do they have?

1010
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,000
The other one was, um, it's a driving one and I can't remember.

1011
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
High speed?

1012
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Yeah.

1013
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
The chase?

1014
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
It might have been the chase.

1015
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Yeah.

1016
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Okay.

1017
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Cause, um, no, there was, yeah, the getaway.

1018
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
And then there was high speed.

1019
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
The getaway.

1020
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
The getaway.

1021
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I'm sorry.

1022
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
It's the getaway.

1023
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
We used to own the getaway.

1024
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
It's pretty fun.

1025
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
You have like a gear shift on it.

1026
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
It's pretty neat.

1027
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
High gear.

1028
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
High gear was one of those games.

1029
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
It was the other NES pinball game.

1030
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Yeah.

1031
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
That wasn't pinball, right?

1032
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
So they've got.

1033
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
High speed.

1034
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
It was a high speed.

1035
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
High speed.

1036
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Yeah.

1037
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,240
They've got a centipede machine that's broken right now, but they have the trackball replaced

1038
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,000
with an eight ball, which is kind of cool.

1039
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:41,680
Um, they've got a Batman driving game, a play choice 10 and donkey Kong three.

1040
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:45,480
Oh, the, the forgotten donkey Kong, no one ever talks about three.

1041
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:51,000
The one where you're killing bugs, uh, the one that's a shooter as opposed to a platformer.

1042
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,480
That's why donkey Kong's ass.

1043
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:54,480
Yeah.

1044
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,600
You're literally blowing smoke up his ass.

1045
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,600
I know.

1046
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,160
Uh, hype mayhem in our chat says, I wish I could get a pinball table, but I can't afford

1047
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,160
thousands of dollars.

1048
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:05,400
Plus I don't trust me, my cats not to damage it.

1049
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:10,160
Midna has been great around our tables, just saying, um, and you don't have to have thousands

1050
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,400
of dollars to get into pinball.

1051
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:19,120
There are plenty of times like we got a black rose for free on the side of the road and

1052
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:23,600
Dan's been fixing it up for his friend, Brian, um, they've been working on it together.

1053
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,640
Um, Craigslist, people will get rid of them.

1054
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:31,240
Our very first one that we got, I think was, was it Rocky and Bull ankle?

1055
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:35,360
And we got that Dan did some work for somebody and got paid in a pinball table and it might,

1056
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,840
it might not be a desirable thing.

1057
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,960
It's probably broken all hell if somebody is willing to get rid of it for free, but

1058
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:41,960
it's, it's a fixer upper.

1059
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:42,960
Right?

1060
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,060
Well, the thing about that too, is that a lot of the ones that you'll find, um, it's

1061
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:48,060
easy to get.

1062
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:52,360
I mean, some of them are not so easy to get parts for, but you've got to be willing to

1063
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:57,560
learn how to do the work for it because it is so much cheaper to shop your machine yourself.

1064
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:02,560
And YouTube obviously has exactly, I mean, and once you know what the parts are and go

1065
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:07,920
through it and on top of that, um, most, uh, the pinball internet database has most of

1066
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:13,020
the manuals for these tables online, including their repair options, parts, orders, things

1067
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,020
like that.

1068
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:18,040
And I'll tell you, like, even though like I'm looking there right now, but like, um,

1069
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:25,440
I find Facebook marketplace, it's basically like Craigslist, um, but that's where I got

1070
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,440
my DDR machine.

1071
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,880
I got a killer deal on the DVR machine.

1072
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,280
I wish I could get that virtual on, but we have zero space for it.

1073
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,640
I posted a picture.

1074
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:37,400
There's a virtual on, um, cabinet that they're selling 800 bucks.

1075
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,400
Yeah.

1076
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,400
Oh wow.

1077
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,040
But you've seen my garage.

1078
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,640
It's filled with Mustang and pinball.

1079
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:45,760
You have so many pinball machines, you have no place left to put a machine like that.

1080
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:46,760
Pretty much.

1081
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:47,760
Yeah.

1082
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,400
Um, I mean, now if I found a planet Harrier, Oh my God, you'd make the room.

1083
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:57,080
No, we, we actually had an offer on one and we didn't have any room for it.

1084
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:03,200
Um, but someone's also, Dan was telling me that someone did like a home, like mini version,

1085
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:07,320
uh, with the full play field and everything, but a mini version of a planet Harriers.

1086
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:12,240
It was like a home mod or something that was like, Oh, I want, but at any rate, yeah, you

1087
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,400
don't need a lot of money to get into pinball.

1088
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:18,240
Just keep your eyes open, be vigilant and you'll find something.

1089
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:22,960
Well, and I was going to say too, like, you know, luckily we have these digital recreations

1090
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,840
as well and I know they're not the same thing, but you know, for somebody that kind of wants

1091
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:34,120
the fix or once, Oh my God, I need, I need arcade one up to make me a mini driving cabinet.

1092
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,120
That's what I need.

1093
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,340
Well, aren't they doing like a version of the star Wars cabinet?

1094
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,800
That's a sit down cabinet.

1095
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:40,800
Yeah, exactly.

1096
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,960
But I need, I need a sit down cabinet with like San Francisco rush and like Dan already

1097
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:52,160
sold his rig in my, I know, but like I'm talking about like something like arcade one up.

1098
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,160
That's things.

1099
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,160
Those things have been doing really well.

1100
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,160
It might happen.

1101
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,160
Stay tuned.

1102
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,160
I need that in my life.

1103
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,160
All right.

1104
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,160
Anyway.

1105
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,440
Uh, and dark tissue is saying arcade one up is doing a line of pins.

1106
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,840
So we're going to have many pinball machines before too long.

1107
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:03,840
That'll be interesting.

1108
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,640
So, all right, maybe theater magic will be one of them.

1109
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:07,640
Who knows?

1110
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,640
All right.

1111
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:09,640
Got the real thing.

1112
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,480
All right.

1113
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:12,480
For now.

1114
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,480
Uh, we're going to move on with the show.

1115
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,800
Uh, at this point though, this is, this is where I had planned for you to make your exit,

1116
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,200
although you can certainly stay up to your limit.

1117
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,200
Dark Sakura.

1118
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,760
I don't know what your plan is.

1119
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:26,040
Um, I'll probably probably go on cause the sooner I get to bed, the less sleep deprived

1120
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,040
I'll be in the morning.

1121
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,840
Um, so, and just, I don't know if we were really explicit about this last week, but

1122
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,720
you kind of have a, and for those that have been listening for a couple of years, you

1123
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:38,360
had kind of a real bad conflict to work situation where you weren't even here for a few months.

1124
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:42,880
And this is unfortunately, I was actually working on Sunday, but this is unfortunately

1125
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,080
kind of a similar situation where you're, now you're working at like four or five in

1126
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,080
the morning.

1127
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,080
Right.

1128
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,080
Tomorrow.

1129
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:54,680
Um, my normal schedule has me working at 5am and for me to be able to get up and be awake

1130
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:59,680
and do my 15 minutes of skincare, um, well, I ain't getting younger.

1131
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:07,200
Um, I have to be up at three 30 in the morning and like last night I actually, I worked yesterday

1132
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:11,360
and then went out doing sister stuff and I didn't get to bed until two 30.

1133
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,000
I was up for 23 hours.

1134
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
So yeah.

1135
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,360
Wow.

1136
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,640
So this is my life.

1137
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:22,040
I know you're trying to do some wheeling and dealing.

1138
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,420
So hopefully this doesn't go on too long, but you may be having some short episodes

1139
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:26,420
for a little while.

1140
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,920
Just while you get that worked out.

1141
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,080
And I mean, I actually tried to get two hours off in the morning so I could do the whole

1142
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:35,200
show, but, um, I could only get one hour off in the morning.

1143
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,200
So say lovey.

1144
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:40,280
Well, we'll take all the Jamie we can get, but in the meantime, no, you can't have all

1145
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,280
of it.

1146
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,160
In the meantime, make that coin.

1147
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:44,160
You gotta, gotta be dead.

1148
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:46,600
You gotta buy more pinball machines.

1149
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:51,620
I gotta get bigger house to have more pinball that too, or just, you know, fill in the whole

1150
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,400
backyard and make it nothing but pinball.

1151
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,320
Uh, final thoughts for our listeners tonight.

1152
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,320
Um, I'm sleepy.

1153
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,320
All right.

1154
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,320
I hate the schedule.

1155
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,320
Good night.

1156
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,320
Sleep tight.

1157
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,320
It makes me want to set people on fire.

1158
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,960
Oh, please don't set me or this house on fire.

1159
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:04,960
No.

1160
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,800
I mean, y'all are great.

1161
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,680
I'm talking about people.

1162
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:12,640
I understand the man.

1163
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:17,240
There's certain people I would like to see burn, but I shouldn't, I shan't to say so.

1164
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,240
All right.

1165
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,240
We'll have a great rest of your night.

1166
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,240
Our soccer.

1167
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,240
Thanks for being here.

1168
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,240
You too.

1169
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,240
All right.

1170
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,240
I'll take my spam and go.

1171
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,240
Okay.

1172
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,560
I literally did have spam for dinner.

1173
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,000
Let's move on to some rapid fire news and we'll talk about some other big headlines

1174
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
of the week.

1175
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
A little quicker.

1176
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:38,880
So Red Dead Redemption 2 has almost doubled the sales of the previous Red Dead Redemption.

1177
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:46,080
Um, number two sitting at right now, 29 million lifetime sales, whereas the original made

1178
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,480
15 million lifetime sales.

1179
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:55,360
So I mean, obviously it's going to happen sooner or later, but it's, uh, not a bad number

1180
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,600
there.

1181
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:03,480
And I'm assuming though, they're seeing that even though that it's doing quite well, that

1182
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:08,560
their quarterly revenue is down 25% year over year.

1183
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:12,840
And that, uh, take two stock has dropped, you know, 9.6%.

1184
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:16,400
That is, you know, with Red Dead Redemption 2, that's a game that like, I thought I would

1185
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:21,480
really like, and then I didn't like it too much.

1186
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,480
Yeah.

1187
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,480
It was like that too.

1188
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:24,480
What happened?

1189
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,280
It's too sim is what it is.

1190
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,040
Grand Theft Auto is fine.

1191
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:32,840
Like I like Grand Theft Auto because you kind of run around and like do stuff, but even

1192
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:39,840
like online is to like management stuff and everything like costs money and it's not really

1193
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:40,840
fun.

1194
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,000
Like I liked four where it's just like, Hey, it's a death match.

1195
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,280
Hey, you go in there, you kill people and you come back out and you're done.

1196
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:51,520
Uh, whereas this is like this persistent online thing and I, I just not interested in that.

1197
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:56,320
Um, and then Red Dead Online, you're definitely not really interested in that at all.

1198
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:02,840
Um, I think maybe like on PC, I might enjoy it more with mods, you know, being able to

1199
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:08,280
cut some of that SIM stuff out and just being able to enjoy like the storyline or something.

1200
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:14,720
That might be a little bit more my cup of tea, but just the game by itself.

1201
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,720
Nah.

1202
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:22,480
Um, and then there's going to be some more games coming to Xbox game pass.

1203
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:30,280
Um, of that we've got Final Fantasy 15 and Wolfenstein Youngblood are, um, should be

1204
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:33,200
already on Xbox games pass now.

1205
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:39,960
Um, and then of course there's also going to be Xbox one and PC versions of, um, death

1206
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:47,920
squared and deaths gambit coming, um, pretty soon, but 15, that's not bad.

1207
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,480
Check it out.

1208
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:52,480
I need the finish checking it out because I've only checked out about 10 minutes.

1209
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,400
I bought it like on a deep sale on steam.

1210
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,280
So the game pass thing doesn't really do anything for me, but I think it's neat.

1211
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:00,700
And maybe when, when they eventually tied into X clouds, so I can play it on some beefy

1212
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:03,560
machines and stuff and stream it, that might be very interesting.

1213
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:07,160
Um, of course I am assuming that it's going to be a thing in the future, but it just,

1214
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,120
it does seem like a logical conclusion to come to.

1215
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,120
We'll see, we'll see.

1216
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:15,000
2020 could be an interesting year, uh, some interesting personnel changes going on in

1217
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
the gaming industry.

1218
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,240
Uh, so we have a rod of Ferguson, who's the head of coalition studio.

1219
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,180
They are behind the gears of war games right now, and he's been working on this series

1220
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:26,080
for 15 years and he's announced he's leaving.

1221
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:30,320
Uh, and where's he going well in March, he will be over Diablo.

1222
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:31,320
That's right.

1223
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:34,000
He's going to blizzard to oversee the Diablo franchise.

1224
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,400
This will include development on Diablo four, and, uh, I guess somewhat what left what's

1225
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,820
left to be done on that Diablo immortal game.

1226
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:44,380
Needless to say, blizzard could use a little help with messaging, I suppose after what

1227
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:46,120
happened a couple of Blizzcons ago.

1228
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:47,960
So maybe there'll be some help to be had here.

1229
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:52,280
I'm not sure what gears of war has in common with Diablo, but I don't think the games necessarily

1230
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:53,960
need to be of the same type.

1231
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:56,880
I think a studio head does a lot of the business ends of things.

1232
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,400
So it'll be interesting to see what develops.

1233
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,400
I know it.

1234
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:02,960
And also is the person that's often to blame when some of these things go wrong that we

1235
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,760
don't like, such as a game taking eight years to get a localized official version in the

1236
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:07,760
U S right.

1237
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:08,760
Yeah.

1238
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:11,680
So it'll be interesting to see what happens with that.

1239
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:16,480
Uh, also, uh, Fortnite, I know some of you are still playing Fortnite and it is interesting

1240
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:20,120
to see some of the various crossovers that Fortnite has done over the years.

1241
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:25,000
And, uh, somebody that digs into those types of files with Fortnite and things has discovered

1242
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,460
that a Harley Quinn will soon be available within Fortnite, apparently Batman and Catwoman

1243
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:31,460
are already there.

1244
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:34,780
They don't play in a Fortnite to really be able to tell you, uh, but it would make sense

1245
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:38,300
as the birds of prey movie is the thing that just happened this weekend and I'm assuming

1246
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:39,300
it did well.

1247
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,180
I heard some people told me it was good.

1248
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:42,580
I don't really watch enough movies.

1249
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:44,900
It hasn't really been on my list of things to see.

1250
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:49,260
Um, but, uh, it's no surprise really that Harley Quinn is making its way or making her

1251
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:50,260
way to Fortnite.

1252
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:51,740
And you know, Sonic comes out this week.

1253
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:52,740
Oh, that's right.

1254
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,360
It's Valentine's day weekend, right?

1255
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,580
You know, it's, I do want to see it, believe it or not.

1256
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:59,420
I am going to go probably Saturday.

1257
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:03,860
I would see it opening day, but, um, I don't think that's going to work, but I'll take

1258
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:05,100
my kids to go see it.

1259
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:11,200
So what's, what's interesting is that I haven't had hosting gigs since last year, just because

1260
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:15,260
the holidays are kind of a slower period and January doesn't exactly start to ramp up.

1261
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:20,140
So I have back to, I have a hosting gig Friday and I have a hosting gig Saturday.

1262
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:24,100
So for those of you in the Sacramento area, uh, I, both these shows are the colonial theater,

1263
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:27,740
a Rocky or a picture show on Saturday and a burlesque variety show on Friday.

1264
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:31,700
Um, so I won't be able to see Sonic this weekend cause I'll be too busy hosting.

1265
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:32,700
Let's go Sunday.

1266
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:35,460
Uh, if it's before OLR during the day, maybe.

1267
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:36,460
Yeah.

1268
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:37,460
I'd be open to that.

1269
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:41,140
I'll just have to, I'll just have to talk to, uh, Hubbers and make sure, well, you can

1270
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:42,140
talk to Hubbers.

1271
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:43,140
He's on his way in.

1272
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,140
All right.

1273
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:48,540
So maybe I will see it before the show, who knows, but you are such a Jim Carrey fan.

1274
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:49,540
You've been excited.

1275
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:50,540
It looks good.

1276
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:51,540
I'm excited.

1277
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:54,780
And even like the little clips that they show are pretty funny.

1278
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:59,820
Speaking of clips, did you know that within PSO two, there are these big video screens

1279
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:03,660
and actually right during the beta, what's playing on those video screens is the Sonic

1280
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:05,340
trailer for the movie.

1281
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:08,260
So, and it plays, it plays like it's a YouTube or something that you actually see in full

1282
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:09,860
resolution and everything up on these screens.

1283
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:10,860
It's kind of neat.

1284
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:14,420
They were doing like concerts and stuff too, but I was, I was out playing board games last

1285
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:18,060
night, so I missed all the concert stuff, but yeah, they run the Sonic trailer over

1286
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:19,060
and over, which is interesting.

1287
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:20,060
Interesting.

1288
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:22,380
That was an interesting way to, uh, but it looks funny.

1289
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:23,820
So I'll watch it.

1290
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:24,820
Yeah.

1291
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:25,820
All right.

1292
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:27,420
I'm moving on.

1293
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:28,500
That's it for rapid fire news.

1294
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:32,500
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games coming soon

1295
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,780
to a store near you.

1296
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:35,780
All right.

1297
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:40,980
Um, we don't have a whole lot coming out this week, but we've got AO tennis two on PC and

1298
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:48,020
it's in the switch, uh, PlayStation four and Xbox one monster Hunter world ice born on PC.

1299
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:55,260
Uh, we have outlier dust trilogy deluxe pack on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation four

1300
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:59,140
and even have stuff coming out on the, Oh, I'm sorry.

1301
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,780
I am looking at January.

1302
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:03,620
That's why some of these sound very familiar.

1303
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:06,020
I was like, wait a minute, scratch all of those games.

1304
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:07,460
Those are already out.

1305
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:08,460
Surprise.

1306
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:12,840
Um, so now let's talk about the actual games that are coming out this week to pull chat.

1307
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:14,660
How many of you actually had a reaction though?

1308
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:15,740
That's like, Oh, that's new.

1309
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:16,740
I have to check that out.

1310
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:18,300
How many of you actually had that reaction?

1311
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:20,100
Like didn't even realize those games are out.

1312
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,100
All right.

1313
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:22,980
So, um, this is a little bit more interesting.

1314
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:28,420
So we've got a zero lane cross wave on PC and PlayStation four this week.

1315
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:31,260
We see a Damon X Machina on PC.

1316
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:38,540
Uh, we have Darksiders Genesis on Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1317
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:44,700
I didn't realize that this is a this week, but dreams is coming out on PlayStation four.

1318
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:51,920
We have snack world, the dungeon crawl gold on Nintendo switch street fighter five championship

1319
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,740
edition on PC and PlayStation four.

1320
01:33:55,740 --> 01:34:00,780
And last but not least a warriors Orochi for ultimate on Nintendo switch and PlayStation

1321
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:01,780
four.

1322
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:02,780
That's it.

1323
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:03,940
All right.

1324
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:04,940
Heading over to Japan.

1325
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:09,180
Um, the releases look a little light in Japan this week, but uh, Nintendo switch has a pretty

1326
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:12,860
big one in Hatsune Miku project diva, mega 39.

1327
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:14,380
It's a 10th anniversary collection.

1328
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:16,260
I think it's like the first time this is on the switch.

1329
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:19,660
I think that's kind of why this is notable, but Hatsune Miku fans, I'm sure we'll be very

1330
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:23,180
happy to check that out on the switch this week.

1331
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:25,500
I'm heading over to the PlayStation four.

1332
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:31,940
We have death end request two that is out in Japan this week, as well as dead by daylight.

1333
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:38,120
The story of Yamaoka family that is also out in Japan as well as dreams universe.

1334
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:41,260
I don't know if that's the same thing as just dreams.

1335
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:42,260
I think it is.

1336
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,260
Yeah.

1337
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:45,460
It's coming out, uh, in Japan this week.

1338
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:46,460
That's pretty cool.

1339
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:47,460
Check that out.

1340
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:48,460
Yeah, for sure.

1341
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:49,460
Um, interesting.

1342
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:50,740
It has a different title over there though.

1343
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:51,740
So there you go.

1344
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:52,740
Those are the Japanese releases.

1345
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:53,740
How about the UK?

1346
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:54,740
Loki.

1347
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:55,740
All right.

1348
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:59,420
So we've got, um, funny enough, they're just now getting the back button attachment for

1349
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:00,540
the dual shock four.

1350
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:04,700
So that's coming out in PlayStation this week, street fighter five championship edition on

1351
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:11,060
PlayStation four, um, black future 88, the physical edition coming out on Nintendo switch

1352
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:12,720
and that's a local game dev here.

1353
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,720
So that's pretty awesome.

1354
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:20,840
Uh, we have snack world on Nintendo switch worries, Rochi for ultimate on PlayStation

1355
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:28,720
four, Xbox one and switch Darksiders Genesis on PlayStation four, Xbox one and switch.

1356
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:32,080
And finally dreams on PlayStation four.

1357
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,080
All right.

1358
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:37,800
Uh, this is the part of the show where typically we would go to the mailbag over at participate

1359
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:43,200
at orange lounge, radio.com, but sadly we do not have any emails this week and I don't

1360
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,920
even have a dark soccer here to dish about drag race with.

1361
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:49,880
Um, but I am trying to change things up here a little bit with this segment for when we

1362
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:54,320
don't necessarily get any emails and try to go back to Twitter a little bit and invite

1363
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,560
your guys's tweets over at O L R on Twitter.

1364
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:02,000
Uh, in fact, I even tried to ask a prompting question tonight about the PSO two beta, but

1365
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,160
I probably posted it too late or people are still playing the beta.

1366
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,200
So I didn't get a lot of feedback on that unfortunately.

1367
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:11,600
So I'll just have to kind of try to make an effort to spice in more Twitter headlines

1368
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,600
throughout the week and get your feedback on that.

1369
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:18,320
Um, but I do want to make sure you guys are aware we are, we are trying to get back on

1370
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:22,640
Twitter using, uh, the interactivity there just because I realized some of you don't

1371
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:26,240
want to write the long form emails sometimes, but if you do, we still invite those participate

1372
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,180
at orange laundry, dio.com.

1373
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:31,040
But for those of you with shorter thoughts or you just have a quick question, you just

1374
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,720
want to ask like, you know, what do you think about this release or what do you think about

1375
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:36,640
this game or have you checked out this retro title or whatever it is?

1376
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:41,760
Uh, you can send that over to our Twitter at O L R. So I will instead make that announcement

1377
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:42,760
with this segment.

1378
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:46,520
And then there's also that show that came on this week that I checked out.

1379
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,160
It was pretty awesome.

1380
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:52,560
Brick masters or Lego masters, Lego masters thing.

1381
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,560
Yeah.

1382
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:57,040
They, they have a European show with is the U S one is cool.

1383
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:58,400
What's what, what did they do?

1384
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:01,940
It's like, I think of it like one of those like cake or cooking competition shows.

1385
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:04,400
So they have, it's my favorite sort of.

1386
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,400
Yeah.

1387
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:09,240
A bunch of teams of two that are like chopped.

1388
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:12,400
That's what's always on the fucking food network in the lunchroom.

1389
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:18,600
I watch chopped all the time, but yes, so, um, sort of like those where they're given

1390
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:23,320
a theme and then they have to build something and then the top person, you know, top group

1391
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:28,620
gets like some immunity idle thing and then, you know, the bottom two, one of them gets

1392
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:29,620
sent home.

1393
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:31,080
Has to lip sync for their life.

1394
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:35,360
Uh, not exactly, but, but yeah, it's so, it's, so it's,

1395
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:38,520
so it's all that and, um, it's fun.

1396
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:39,860
I liked it.

1397
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:43,760
I will say the one tangential drag race thing I could bring up is that RuPaul apparently

1398
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,960
hosted Saturday night live last night.

1399
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:49,220
I missed it cause board games, you know, I was out doing that and well, that's what YouTube's

1400
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:50,220
for now.

1401
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:51,220
Yeah.

1402
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:52,220
Right.

1403
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:53,220
All the clips.

1404
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:54,220
Yeah.

1405
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:55,220
They do put all the clips up there, but I'm curious how that went, how that was, if it

1406
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:56,220
was funny or not.

1407
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:58,380
Apparently it got good ratings though.

1408
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:02,240
They said that that episode brought in better ratings than the week before and it was one

1409
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:08,240
of the stronger, I think it tied with the will also the musical guest or no, no, they

1410
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,240
had Justin Bieber.

1411
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:13,220
Uh, so they think it's some kind of kind of combination of a Bieber nation or whatever

1412
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:17,500
they call the fans and RuPaul, uh, and you know, people hoping to see him in drag and

1413
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,720
stuff, uh, kind of carried that a little bit.

1414
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:25,840
So, but I don't believe RuPaul showed up in drag except in taped segments, which was,

1415
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:30,480
you know, it, from what I understand, it takes a team of people to put RuPaul together at

1416
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,640
this point.

1417
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:35,440
So it probably is a complex mechanism of wheels and pulleys.

1418
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:39,760
You're saying, you're saying that RuPaul hasn't quite gathered the technology that like Tony

1419
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:46,400
Stark has, where he's just like, it's a technology, but it's just, you know, it's a little different.

1420
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,800
So nano machines to put together the drag outfit.

1421
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:50,800
Yeah.

1422
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:51,800
All right.

1423
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,800
Anyway, let's move on.

1424
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:57,400
Uh, let's get back into gaming and talk about, um, emulation, uh, uh, kind of an interesting

1425
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:58,400
topic sometimes.

1426
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,400
Yeah.

1427
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:05,960
Um, considering, um, you know, obviously I it's very early, but PlayStation 4, um, emulation

1428
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:10,080
is kind of being, it's a thing that's starting to happen now.

1429
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:18,400
So, um, right now there's a project called GP CS4 that has managed to boot a commercial

1430
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,400
game.

1431
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:28,200
It's, um, not necessarily playable, I mean, it's quite slow, but it is progress.

1432
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:33,520
Um, but, but it's there, it's not just a loading error failure or anything like that.

1433
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,520
Right.

1434
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,680
It is actually, it is, it is a program that is running.

1435
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:37,680
It is.

1436
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,680
Yes.

1437
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:39,680
It is a thing.

1438
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:40,680
Yeah.

1439
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:45,520
So right now they're, um, trying to move on to near automata, which is, it seems like

1440
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:51,120
a loft that is like immensely more complicated than the game that they're booting right now,

1441
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:56,440
but, um, it is something that is being worked on, but interesting.

1442
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:01,640
Um, there's also another emulation project called orbital that I don't know what the

1443
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:07,320
progress is on that one, but very interesting to see that we've come a long way for this.

1444
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:10,360
I don't know how feasible this is going to be.

1445
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:15,680
I probably not anytime soon, but you know, computers are getting more powerful, so why

1446
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:16,680
not?

1447
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:19,640
It's just a matter of the technology getting more powerful and you know, pretty soon I'm

1448
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:22,160
sure they'll start to run it a little more full speed.

1449
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:25,520
And I know people might be uncomfortable when we talk about emulation because I know a lot

1450
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,760
of times emulation gets tied to piracy and so forth, you know, like some people might

1451
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:33,240
be looking at this as like, Oh, this is just a way to, you know, play PlayStation four games

1452
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:34,240
for free.

1453
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:38,920
But I kind of don't know if that is such a, I don't think that's really the only way to

1454
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:42,480
look at these things anymore or even our way you should look at these things anymore because

1455
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:46,120
I think it's a little more complicated than that because, um, well for one, the technology's

1456
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:49,920
not going to be there until long after they stop, you know, selling PlayStation four games

1457
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,920
new in GameStop, or at least it feels that way.

1458
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:52,920
Right?

1459
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,600
Like we're not going to get 60 frames a second, 10 80 piece.

1460
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:59,360
We might get playable, uh, very soon, but we're not going to get like full, you know,

1461
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:02,320
speed full everything in the next couple of years.

1462
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:06,600
But I think what's also really important to what's interesting here in the year 2020 just

1463
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:11,680
last week, we were talking about how there is a, um, big website preserving all these

1464
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:14,960
flash games because flash is going away.

1465
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:15,960
Right.

1466
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:21,020
And I think when it comes to video game preservation, I think there's very strongly a pro case to

1467
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:25,620
be made for PlayStation four emulation and how we kind of need something like that to

1468
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:32,940
ensure that these games are still explorable on newer technologies as PCs get better and

1469
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:33,940
better.

1470
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:37,180
And also like at some point, like I get it, you guys kind of kind of cut your losses.

1471
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:42,180
I mean, cause if you think about it, it's like, how much are we really impacting the

1472
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:49,140
sales of games when we're like, say emulating the Xbox three 60 at this point or like emulating

1473
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:53,980
the original, like PlayStation two or something like you're really not like cutting into those

1474
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:55,300
sales.

1475
01:41:55,300 --> 01:42:00,020
I think at all on anything, it's just kind of a fun thing to do.

1476
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:04,500
It's not like I'm, I'm doing this because I don't want to pay for your game.

1477
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:08,300
You know, like I don't think it's, I don't, I don't really think it's that.

1478
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:11,620
I think it's part of the preservation thing I think is really exciting, especially as

1479
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:15,820
you know, uh, it's going to be harder and harder to maybe find these games or, um, you

1480
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:20,740
know, as, as servers get shut down, I would imagine, and maybe I'm just being ignorant

1481
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:25,900
and I fully admit that this would lead to potentially being able to emulate and be able

1482
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:29,900
to have it connect to a different type of server so that people could continue to play

1483
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:33,500
online games even after the plug has maybe been pulled.

1484
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:36,740
You know, and maybe I realize it gets a little weird cause you know, you're emulating, so

1485
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:40,240
you're running the original codes, but yeah, but I feel like this still kind of cracks

1486
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:45,340
the door open to that sort of, you know, ability to preserve some of these online only games

1487
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:49,900
that have gone and now, you know, our kids and our kids' kids won't be able to really

1488
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:52,780
check them out, you know, unless we have something like this.

1489
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:55,300
And then of course there's the whole home brew element too.

1490
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:56,300
Yes.

1491
01:42:56,300 --> 01:43:00,740
I'm hoping someday in the far future, you know, we'll have, you know, games, are you

1492
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:06,980
full, you know, full speed emulation for Xbox 360 with online support so that I can bring

1493
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:09,260
back my modded Grand Theft Auto games.

1494
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:14,460
Ah, someday, someday it'll happen where I can play multiplayer with that nose.

1495
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:15,460
And let's be real too.

1496
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:18,140
We need to make sure that your kids someday can play PT.

1497
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:20,340
It's very important, right?

1498
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:21,740
Not really.

1499
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:22,740
What?

1500
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:26,140
I would think, I would think PT would be the game on top of that list.

1501
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:27,140
Not near.

1502
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:28,140
Okay.

1503
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:30,340
Maybe I could see near, but PT should be towards the top of that list of things we've got to

1504
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:32,040
get emulated fast.

1505
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,040
So I don't know.

1506
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,900
Anyway, I talk like it's an easy thing to do.

1507
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:36,940
It's very much not.

1508
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:42,880
So good luck to everybody that's working volunteer hours cause you know, it ain't like Sony,

1509
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:46,120
you know, putting their own people on it, uh, to put something like that together.

1510
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:50,500
How long until someone, uh, recreates PT in Dreams?

1511
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,760
If that's probably already been done or anything.

1512
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:54,040
Didn't we have that headline for him?

1513
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:55,040
Maybe we did.

1514
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,280
I don't know.

1515
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:02,440
It's been so long and I don't keep track of the Dreams stuff, but yeah, so, all right.

1516
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:08,320
Uh, let's Questbuster in chat says someone did manage to save Yaris from Oblivion.

1517
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:13,240
Well, let's, let's thank that individual for their cultural contributions, shan't we?

1518
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:15,640
Has someone put a Yaris in Oblivion though?

1519
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:16,640
That's the question.

1520
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,640
All right.

1521
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:23,560
Uh, let's move on and talk about, uh, this is actually a pretty serious and it's again,

1522
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:28,480
one of those little stories about how like real world can kind of impact the gaming industry.

1523
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:32,720
Not to say gaming industry isn't the real world, but it's, it's just kind of interesting.

1524
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:39,880
And it has to do with, uh, folks that are not able to get into the US to be able to

1525
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:41,800
work on video games.

1526
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:46,360
Um, for example, and I apologize, I'm probably going to mispronounce these names, so I apologize,

1527
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:53,240
but, um, Anam Sajid and Basima Zia, they are young female game developers from Pakistan

1528
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:57,440
and they got scholarships from the IGDA Foundation, right?

1529
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:01,360
The Independent Game Developers Association, or excuse me, International, sorry, not Independent,

1530
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:04,720
uh, Game Developers Association, they got those scholarships early this year.

1531
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:08,560
Uh, Sajid was going to be in the Scholars Program, Zia was going to be in the Velocity

1532
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:14,480
Track, that's to try to propel people of marginalized genders with their game development careers.

1533
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:18,960
So they got good news there and then they applied for visas to get to the United States

1534
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,440
and they were rejected.

1535
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:27,400
So unfortunately, because of that stuff that's going on in our world, uh, they were unable

1536
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:31,880
to really, you know, make use of that, which is very sad.

1537
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:37,160
Um, they've gone to Twitter to tweet some of their thoughts and, uh, Zia did, it's very

1538
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:42,240
humble and very kind, uh, whereas I would probably be on Twitter going, fuck these fucking

1539
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:46,880
people, fucking fucks, you know, uh, it's much more humble and graceful.

1540
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,320
Uh, Zia says it's an honor nonetheless.

1541
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:54,880
Uh, and what's interesting about that, the IGDA Pakistan account tweeted some pictures

1542
01:45:54,880 --> 01:46:00,560
of these females, uh, actually participating in the Global Game Jam 2020.

1543
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:05,240
It's a worldwide marathon helping participants, uh, build games quickly and build a game in

1544
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:06,760
just one weekend.

1545
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,840
The theme was repair.

1546
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:14,400
So the two of them worked together on a game called Trying to Fly.

1547
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:21,160
And it's a 2D game based on the visa interview process that failed them.

1548
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:24,920
Describing the game, they said they wanted to make a game that would highlight their

1549
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:30,720
and others experience at the visa interview process and how such measures can directly

1550
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:34,080
have an effect on their future careers and lives.

1551
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:41,080
The bird represents the applicant's dreams and aspirations for the future.

1552
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:49,800
If that doesn't dot the I and cross the T on the video games are art argument, I don't

1553
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:51,440
know what does.

1554
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:58,480
Because that's, that's amazing that, you know, because, because art is often born of these

1555
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:02,840
types of strong feelings, expression, right?

1556
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:08,320
And so these two women, even though they were probably very internally very upset at what

1557
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:11,960
happened, they were externally very graceful in, uh, what they, you know, put out there

1558
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:17,200
in their statements and so forth, but they still kind of took that energy and made a

1559
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:22,960
game about it to describe what it feels like in a way.

1560
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:29,120
So other people can experience that and feel even maybe a percentage of what they're feeling

1561
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:30,120
in the moment.

1562
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:32,160
Like that, that is art.

1563
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:33,160
That is expressionism.

1564
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:39,240
Like, I almost feel like a story like this makes the argument even better that video

1565
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:43,800
games are art than like the video game journey does.

1566
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:47,940
And you, you know what, you know, I'm being serious when I say that, cause y'all know

1567
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:51,140
how much I love the video game journey and what a big fricking deal that is.

1568
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:55,800
Even better than don't shit your pants, even, even way more important than don't shit your

1569
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:59,000
pants when it comes to artistic contributions.

1570
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Absolutely.

1571
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,960
Um, some folks in chat has actually, uh, some folks in chat have actually played the game,

1572
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:04,960
which I think is great.

1573
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:07,200
Uh, Questbuster says, I tried the game.

1574
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:10,360
It's a tongue in cheek commentary on what they went through.

1575
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:13,240
I'm a student visa denied.

1576
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:18,360
So, uh, very, very, I, so I would definitely, I want to make it a point to play this game

1577
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:23,320
myself this week and check it out and just, uh, you know, see, see what it's all about.

1578
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:27,760
And I would encourage others to do the same, you know, unfortunately these, uh, women are

1579
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,440
not able to come over here to the States to make some other games.

1580
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:34,240
So they've made their own game to really describe what they're feeling.

1581
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,900
And I think we owe it to them to check it out.

1582
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:39,860
So, um, that's that on that.

1583
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:40,860
Let's move on.

1584
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:41,860
Loki.

1585
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:42,860
All right.

1586
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:48,180
Um, so, you know, kind of jumping back onto the EA hate train again.

1587
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:52,500
Um, well, there's, there's nothing to make us feel better than a good old let's hate

1588
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,500
EA story.

1589
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:57,980
Uh, you know what, something the whole world can come together and agree on.

1590
01:48:57,980 --> 01:48:58,980
You know what?

1591
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:02,580
We may have our differences when it comes to political opinions and we, we may have

1592
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:07,260
our differences on these sorts of things, but darn, if we can all hold hands and agree

1593
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:09,180
EA sucks.

1594
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:15,820
So this is coming from a lawsuit filed from a couple lawyers in Paris that have basically

1595
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:21,400
said on behalf of players who claim the only way to win at ultimate team is to spend real

1596
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:27,340
money on packs, which, you know, it is a very play to win, uh, or pay to win game, uh, basically

1597
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:31,280
said, you know, for example, um, in this game, everyone wants to have a dream team to go

1598
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:32,640
as far as possible.

1599
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:38,760
My client spends 600 Euro in five months without even getting a big player, the developers

1600
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:43,080
of the game mode have created an illusionary and particularly addictive system.

1601
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:47,920
The more you pay, the more you have the possibility of getting big players.

1602
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:53,380
We believe that gambling, a gambling game has been integrated into this video game because

1603
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:56,200
buying packs is nothing more than a bet.

1604
01:49:56,200 --> 01:50:01,780
It is a logic of a casino that has entered in their homes today and 11 or 12 year old

1605
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:08,680
teenager can without restriction play, uh, FIFA ultimate team and commit money because

1606
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:14,120
there's no parental control system in this mode, Belgium and the Netherlands have already

1607
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:17,420
taken up this issue.

1608
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:22,660
So they have filed a lawsuit and we'll see what happens here, but I mean, this isn't

1609
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:25,720
the first time that someone's pointing out, I almost feel like this is a broken record

1610
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:26,720
type of story.

1611
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:29,980
What's fascinating to me is that here we are again, like it's almost like one of these

1612
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:33,580
types of things that kind of like isn't going away, but it's also because obviously, you

1613
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:38,500
know, sometimes we lose sight of it here in the States, but FIFA worldwide is the video

1614
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:39,500
game.

1615
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:40,500
Yeah.

1616
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:42,200
And 600 600 is not even that much.

1617
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:46,100
There is, um, comments that saying that, you know, some individuals, they knew people that

1618
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:51,060
spent two or 3,000 Euro on this game as well.

1619
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:56,700
And mind you that this is only good for like this one iteration.

1620
01:50:56,700 --> 01:51:02,060
And I believe each time you buy a new version of the game, you have to do it all over again.

1621
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:04,940
Friends and repeat.

1622
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:07,220
Well, we'll see what comes to this.

1623
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:10,700
Maybe, maybe this game will get banned in countries.

1624
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:15,080
We talked about like how they like, even like the switch version of the game was just kind

1625
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:17,080
of, it literally was a roster update.

1626
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:22,220
Like they, they had found, there was a video that had actually found that there was the

1627
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:28,620
previous game's logo up in the stands and like, it's like, they didn't even bother to

1628
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:29,620
just replace it.

1629
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:32,060
It's like they scrubbed the game, but not very well.

1630
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:33,060
Yes.

1631
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:34,060
Yeah.

1632
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:35,060
It's not good.

1633
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:36,060
Yikes.

1634
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:37,060
All right.

1635
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:38,260
Well, let's, uh, let's move on.

1636
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:42,740
Uh, we're going to talk about one more story here before we get to our discord segment

1637
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:47,180
where we can, uh, talk to some folks that, uh, want to say hello and, and, uh, share

1638
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:50,620
whatever topic they want to on the show over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

1639
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:54,780
And I know one person in particular, an old favorite of the show wants to call in tonight

1640
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:56,220
to talk about something.

1641
01:51:56,220 --> 01:52:00,200
So, um, I know we have that coming, so we'll have at least one call tonight for sure.

1642
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:03,880
But before we get there, let's talk a little bit about the Sony PlayStation business and

1643
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:07,660
how it's slowing and it's slowing a little faster than expected.

1644
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:11,340
Now hold on, because that might, you know, if, if I were to leave it at a headline length

1645
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:14,620
there or the type of thing that somebody might post on Facebook, you might kind of have a

1646
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:15,620
reaction to that.

1647
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:19,220
But I think if you sit down and logically think about it, well, we know the PlayStation

1648
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:23,140
four is wrapping up and the PlayStation five is coming.

1649
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:28,540
So people are probably waiting on their PlayStation four purchases to just buy a PlayStation five

1650
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:29,600
when it comes out.

1651
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:34,060
This is not anything we haven't seen before, right?

1652
01:52:34,060 --> 01:52:39,340
But I guess it's being reported on because it's slowing down perhaps maybe a little slower

1653
01:52:39,340 --> 01:52:44,340
or maybe a little, sorry, it's slowing faster than people were potentially anticipating.

1654
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:49,180
Um, talking about the third quarter fiscal year, which would be the actual end of the

1655
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:55,100
calendar year, October to 30, uh, October 1st, December 31st, sales were down by 20%

1656
01:52:55,100 --> 01:53:00,640
due to a decrease in PlayStation four hardware and third party software sales, uh, operating

1657
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,420
income was also down.

1658
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:08,860
Uh, and this is all, uh, from a, um, report, uh, a financial, uh, disclosure.

1659
01:53:08,860 --> 01:53:14,420
Um, and, uh, so the company has adjusted their financial forecast, dropping the outlook for

1660
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:19,020
sales by 50 billion yen and the operating income by 5 billion yen, because of course

1661
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:24,580
Sony is a Japanese company reports these numbers in, in, uh, Japanese ways, um, and figures.

1662
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:29,220
Um, so, uh, you know, I mean, it's kind of one of the things where it's like, okay, it's

1663
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:31,540
slowing down, but is anybody really that surprised?

1664
01:53:31,540 --> 01:53:35,700
Because of course the PlayStation fives on the horizon and did Sony really have a huge

1665
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:38,180
holiday game this last year?

1666
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:41,140
I feel like was Spider-Man this last year.

1667
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:42,140
I don't even know.

1668
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:43,140
Spider-Man was September.

1669
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:47,260
I mean, I guess that's technically fourth quarter, but that's, I mean, I feel, I still

1670
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:51,620
feel like that isn't as big of a game as some of the other big things that Sony puts out.

1671
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:56,420
You know, especially from them skipping E3, we kind of knew we know some titles that were

1672
01:53:56,420 --> 01:54:01,660
expected got pushed back like last of us to final fantasy seven remake and some things

1673
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:04,920
that I think a lot of us are sitting here going, are they just going to release those

1674
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:07,060
on PlayStation five at this point?

1675
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:11,620
And I think truly the answer is these games will play on your PlayStation five because

1676
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:14,480
you already know PS five is going to play PS four games because they're showing off

1677
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:17,780
Spider-Man on the PlayStation five to show up, to show the times.

1678
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:21,860
So I think they will definitely make a case for, you can play these games on your PlayStation

1679
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:27,020
five and they will run bigger, better, faster, stronger, harder type of thing.

1680
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:29,140
Well, that's nice.

1681
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:34,340
I like being able to play my library, especially since I have a bunch of stuff on PlayStation

1682
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:35,340
four already.

1683
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:40,660
Um, although I do kind of want a new X-Box thing, I don't know, uh, Y Y R says, isn't

1684
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:45,380
it slowing faster than expected because there aren't many big exclusives left to release

1685
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:49,500
and wants to make sure I pick up, he said, aren't many not aren't any.

1686
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,440
And I think that absolutely does play into it.

1687
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:55,700
We know it's slowing down on the Sony side and I think most people that wanted to get

1688
01:54:55,700 --> 01:55:00,460
a PlayStation four probably have at this point and SSG 100 Matt brings up game sales outside

1689
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:04,660
of a few outliers were down last year from what I understand switch dominated the market

1690
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:05,660
for sure.

1691
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:08,660
And that probably plays into it as well is that there's probably a lot of families out

1692
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:12,960
there that around the holiday time probably picked up a switch as their console of choice

1693
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:16,940
and passed on maybe getting a PlayStation four for whatever reason, whether it's just

1694
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:21,460
the cutie Nintendo factor or it just fits better in their home or just the fact that

1695
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:23,140
again, PlayStation five is looming.

1696
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:26,620
So it's like, well, let's get the switch this year and then we'll get the PlayStation five

1697
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:30,900
next year, which is why I think it's fascinating that Nintendo has come out and said no new

1698
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:32,880
switch this year.

1699
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:36,040
So I mean, obviously they just did that last week cause we reported on that last week.

1700
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:39,560
So I didn't affect holiday numbers, but it is interesting to see that they've said that.

1701
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:43,880
So people now are kind of free to think, Oh, well maybe I can get a PlayStation five cause

1702
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:47,360
there's not going to be a new switch for me to buy or an Xbox series X, whatever it is

1703
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:52,080
that you're into or upgrading my PC, which some people will do.

1704
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:55,380
Now it's not like all this news is terrible for Sony.

1705
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:57,480
It should be pointed out.

1706
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:04,720
PlayStation plus subscriber service is up increased to 38.8 million from 36.3 million

1707
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:06,160
this time last year.

1708
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:08,460
So there is that little silver lining.

1709
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:11,820
That's still quite the increase in those subscribers.

1710
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:15,560
And just this month I noticed my PlayStation four, I pulled down the Bioshock collection.

1711
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:17,800
That seems like a pretty big game to be released.

1712
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:20,320
It's actually, it's two separate games.

1713
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:21,320
It's there.

1714
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:24,720
You get the Bioshock infinite cause they were probably two separate discs when they really,

1715
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:29,440
but there's Bioshock infinite in one box on your manual and then Bioshock two on the

1716
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:30,440
other box.

1717
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:31,880
So kind of interesting.

1718
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:32,880
I thought so.

1719
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,880
All right.

1720
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:38,480
So anyhow, do you think, I mean, do you think we're reading too much into that, that it's

1721
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:42,120
kind of one of those, this really isn't a big deal and we'll, we'll just kind of see

1722
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,120
what happens this year.

1723
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:45,080
Cause I kind of feel like that's, that's where this ultimately ends up.

1724
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:47,720
It's like, I mean, I don't want to read into everything.

1725
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:51,560
I just, just give me the news and then they'll figure it out.

1726
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:53,620
And I know I am all over that Final Fantasy seven remake.

1727
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:56,140
I am so hyped for that remake.

1728
01:56:56,140 --> 01:56:59,700
I don't know if I've been hyped for a game this much in a long time.

1729
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:00,700
I don't know.

1730
01:57:00,700 --> 01:57:04,260
I should feel like I should be more hyped for it, but I just, I'm like, not really even

1731
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:08,500
I understand some of the cynicism and so forth, but it's like every time there's a new trailer

1732
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:11,780
or do something like they just put out that trailer out of his last week or the week before

1733
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:15,940
that showed like the honeybee and sequences and all that and I was like, Oh damn, like

1734
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:20,240
this could have been massively fucking cringe and who knows it might still be, but at least

1735
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:25,060
in the trailer, it looks like they nailed it and made it like appropriate for 2020.

1736
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:29,880
And it's going to be like, and just, just the whole, and not just that scene, just the

1737
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:33,960
way it all looks the whole game, just like, I'm like, dang, it's going to be like almost

1738
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:34,960
an all new story.

1739
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:35,960
I'm really hyped about it.

1740
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:37,960
I really, really, it looks good.

1741
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:40,860
All right, let's get to some calls.

1742
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:45,800
So every week we invite you guys to call in on our discord server over at vognetwork.com

1743
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:47,280
slash discord.

1744
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:51,880
But I believe we have a very special caller already on the line waiting to chat with us.

1745
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:52,880
Hello.

1746
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:53,880
Are you there?

1747
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:54,880
Caller?

1748
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:56,600
You know, you don't have to butter me up, right?

1749
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:58,600
I, of course I do.

1750
01:57:58,600 --> 01:58:01,960
I want to, I enjoy buttering my bread.

1751
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:02,960
Why?

1752
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:04,640
Why are, how are you doing my friend?

1753
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:06,640
I was bred for this apparently.

1754
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:07,960
I'm doing okay.

1755
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:08,960
How are you?

1756
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:12,160
You, you were born to make OLR dreams in reality.

1757
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:13,160
Why?

1758
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:14,420
Why are no, I'm doing great.

1759
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:15,420
What is on your mind?

1760
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:16,420
My friend?

1761
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:19,780
Oh, well, let's see.

1762
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:25,700
At work, we started our windows 10 rollout, so I'm spinning like a top there.

1763
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:31,660
And then on the weekends and the evenings, when I have anything left in the tank, I am

1764
01:58:31,660 --> 01:58:40,540
doing my best to ramp up for the February 26th release of sharpshooter plus congratulations

1765
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:41,700
on the release.

1766
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:43,940
And you know, I believe we have some footage.

1767
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:45,180
Should I roll that tape?

1768
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:48,420
Oh, you absolutely should.

1769
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:51,840
I will.

1770
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:52,840
So it's going to be a delay.

1771
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:53,840
It's rolling now.

1772
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:55,860
Obviously you're not going to really be able to see it, but we are looking at the trailer

1773
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:57,720
live on screen.

1774
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:02,540
So basically I tried to convey with this minute and a half approximately trailer, which is

1775
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:09,340
going to be the front thing on steam, um, that this is a straight up action packed shooting

1776
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:10,340
game.

1777
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:11,460
I just want to, I want to warn too.

1778
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:12,460
It's very flashy.

1779
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:17,300
Why we are, I don't know if that is an issue for people that might be susceptible to flashes,

1780
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:19,100
but I just want to warn the viewer.

1781
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:20,480
There are a lot of flashes.

1782
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:24,120
So just, just if that is something that is, um, you shouldn't be looking at very flashy

1783
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:25,120
things.

1784
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:26,900
You might want to virtualize for just a moment.

1785
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:28,540
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1786
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:30,340
Um, yes.

1787
01:59:30,340 --> 01:59:33,980
So Oh, Bobby Black Wolf asks, will there be an epilepsy mode?

1788
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:39,500
You know, in retrospect, I probably should put something in the options to disable the

1789
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:41,260
flash when you shoot.

1790
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:45,940
I mean, basically what it's supposed to do is emulate, Oh, it feels like the light gun

1791
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:46,940
games used to.

1792
01:59:46,940 --> 01:59:47,940
Yeah.

1793
01:59:47,940 --> 01:59:48,940
Yeah.

1794
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:49,940
You nailed that.

1795
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:50,940
Like I totally get the aesthetic you're trying to go for here.

1796
01:59:50,940 --> 01:59:51,940
Like it makes sense.

1797
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:55,300
But then I was like, Ooh, that I was like, Oh no, I wonder if that could be a thing.

1798
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:56,300
Yeah.

1799
01:59:56,300 --> 01:59:57,300
So I'm glad, you know what?

1800
01:59:57,300 --> 01:59:58,300
I'm fucking glad we've talked about it here.

1801
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:00,300
And now it's like, Oh yay.

1802
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:01,300
Accessibility.

1803
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:02,300
Yay.

1804
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:06,260
Oh, and then I'd re-render the trailer says Bobby Black Wolf in chat.

1805
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:09,500
Uh, yeah, I guess that's not a bad idea.

1806
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:10,500
Hmm.

1807
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:12,740
Well, um, yeah.

1808
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:13,740
Okay.

1809
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:14,740
Thanks again.

1810
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:15,740
But let's talk about it.

1811
02:00:15,740 --> 02:00:19,020
Cause it does look awesome because I know it feels it's, it's filling a void and I'll

1812
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:20,020
go back.

1813
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:21,020
The trailer's done.

1814
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:22,020
So I'll go back to the main shot.

1815
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:26,820
Um, I, uh, I feel like it's definitely filling a void that has been left by games like point

1816
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:29,140
blank and these games that I used to love.

1817
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:32,180
I feel like sharp shooter is, is kind of filling that niche.

1818
02:00:32,180 --> 02:00:33,180
Is that what you're aiming for?

1819
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:41,700
It, I mean, basically this game is, um, it's basically my version of a point blank or a

1820
02:00:41,700 --> 02:00:43,260
police trainer.

1821
02:00:43,260 --> 02:00:46,820
It's uh, it's got 20 separate mini games.

1822
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:53,060
It randomizes them, uh, you know, for every time you play, there's five different difficulty

1823
02:00:53,060 --> 02:00:54,060
levels.

1824
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:57,660
And then within those, it adjusts as you're playing, the better you're doing, the harder

1825
02:00:57,660 --> 02:00:58,660
it gets.

1826
02:00:58,660 --> 02:01:00,500
So it increases the scoring potential.

1827
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:05,580
Um, yeah, it's, uh, I basically use those as my direct inspiration.

1828
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:12,020
The biggest difference from those games is instead of giving you a set number of lives

1829
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:20,100
and then killing one each time, uh, you mess up or you fail to reach a goal, the, um, instead

1830
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:26,980
what happens is you get 10,000 points each time you complete a game, you don't get that

1831
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:30,940
10,000 points if you fail to achieve the quota.

1832
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:36,420
And then at the end of the game, you're given a grade based on your score.

1833
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:41,060
And so if you fail to complete too many goals, you're going to get saddled with a C or a

1834
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:45,500
D, you know, and there's no way to go back and try it again.

1835
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:54,700
So yeah, at least if I got a D, I still passed, I mean, it's, it's, uh, it's up to you what

1836
02:01:54,700 --> 02:02:00,260
you consider passing, but I don't think I even put an F in there.

1837
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:01,260
To be honest.

1838
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:02,980
Uh, what's the lowest grade you can get.

1839
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:04,300
I should check that.

1840
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:10,460
I'm not sure I put in anything below a D to be honest, but if you, if you, if you flame,

1841
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:14,860
if you flame out completely, like you don't even score a point, Loki's face should just

1842
02:02:14,860 --> 02:02:18,180
pop up as the grade.

1843
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:19,740
I think I'll forego that.

1844
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:21,640
All right, fine.

1845
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:23,440
You have, you have more important feedback to take away.

1846
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:26,320
Maybe you're going to have to just update it when I actually do finish something.

1847
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:27,320
No problem.

1848
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:28,320
All right.

1849
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:35,520
I know he's listening, but I was actually seriously flirting with the idea.

1850
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:40,900
I don't think I'm going to do it, but I was cause the steam support, it can see your username.

1851
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:49,340
So I was actually, um, uh, flirting with the idea of for Bobby Black Wolf only renaming

1852
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:55,660
the easiest difficulty, Bobby Black Wolf.

1853
02:02:55,660 --> 02:03:00,540
I think you should still do it.

1854
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:01,540
I didn't.

1855
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:02,540
Okay.

1856
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:03,540
You can do that on steam.

1857
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:05,900
You can like codify messages to people.

1858
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:10,420
So like if, if I know Loki O L R is playing my game, I could send a message that says,

1859
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:11,820
Hey, screw you buddy.

1860
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:12,820
Or something like that.

1861
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:16,580
And that's kind of crazy.

1862
02:03:16,580 --> 02:03:20,140
I mean, all you have to do is basically say, Oh, what's their username.

1863
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:21,140
Is it this?

1864
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:22,140
Okay.

1865
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:24,480
Then put that up instead of this.

1866
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:25,480
How funny.

1867
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:26,480
All right.

1868
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:29,400
Well, that's, that's, I love it, but yeah, the game's got, I mean, for those in the podcast

1869
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:33,300
feed that weren't able to see the trailer, the game obviously has like a very, your,

1870
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:38,560
your, um, your games have a very unique kind of retro style to them that feel very like

1871
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:41,900
an arcade game of the late eighties sort of look to them.

1872
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:43,540
That's exactly what I'm doing.

1873
02:03:43,540 --> 02:03:44,540
Yeah.

1874
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:46,900
I want to do an arcade game basically.

1875
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:47,900
Yeah.

1876
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:51,300
And it, you got it.

1877
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:56,300
So I mean, it's what I still enjoy playing the most arcade games.

1878
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:58,420
So that's exclusively what I do.

1879
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:02,780
So yeah, I'm, I'm hoping to bring the arcade experience to you.

1880
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:11,660
And so, you know, as much as is practical to do within today's modern you know, platforms.

1881
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:17,900
And I think the most exciting thing about this version of the game is that you can play

1882
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:24,100
on a controller if you want to, but you can also pick up a mouse or the best one is touchscreen.

1883
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:28,340
If you've got a touchscreen computer or a touchscreen connected to your computer, it's

1884
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:29,660
super fun.

1885
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:34,220
And I ramp up the difficulty to account for the fact that you have 10 guns as opposed

1886
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:35,780
to the usual one.

1887
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:38,980
Yeah, I definitely want to try this in a touchscreen mode.

1888
02:04:38,980 --> 02:04:40,980
That sounds really, really fun.

1889
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:44,060
Even though yes, of course, the difficulty is going to be a lot harder.

1890
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:48,740
I always thought, you know, mouse and keyboard is a, or excuse me, mouse, specifically is

1891
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:53,020
is a decent, you know, alternative when you know, you're limited on the research you have.

1892
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:58,460
Obviously PCs don't have light gun attachments very easy or like that everybody has.

1893
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:00,540
But I think the mouse works.

1894
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:05,540
And I think, because I played Sharpshooter when you had it on Xbox 360, on the indie

1895
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:06,540
games thing.

1896
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:09,100
You know, the controller worked, you did, you did a good job with that.

1897
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:13,940
But it's just, you know, that type of game just feels better with something you have

1898
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:17,740
a little more control over like a mouse, or like a touchscreen.

1899
02:05:17,740 --> 02:05:19,460
I think it's gonna be great.

1900
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:22,300
Yeah, I had it running on touchscreen at magfest.

1901
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:28,240
And I had tried showing sharpshooter before at a few previous conventions, and no one

1902
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:29,800
really took a look at it.

1903
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:34,260
But when it was on touchscreen, I had people playing it all throughout the weekend and

1904
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:35,940
really enjoying it.

1905
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:38,700
And a few people actually throwing money at it.

1906
02:05:38,700 --> 02:05:42,220
So I, it's, it's definitely fun.

1907
02:05:42,220 --> 02:05:48,300
And I hope that a lot of people get to try the touchscreen mode, because it's, it's definitely

1908
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:49,300
special.

1909
02:05:49,300 --> 02:05:53,460
And I'm going to be spending a lot of time over the next two weeks, really polishing

1910
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:54,460
the difficulty.

1911
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:57,860
I want to make it so that anyone can enjoy it.

1912
02:05:57,860 --> 02:06:03,900
But only the most dedicated will see that AAA top grade on the master difficulty.

1913
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:05,100
All right.

1914
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:10,620
Well, I hope folks will check this out when it releases the date again, February 20, what

1915
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:11,620
was it?

1916
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:15,120
Well, about that.

1917
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:18,340
So here's the thing.

1918
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:20,780
I have to test leaderboards.

1919
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:26,740
It's really tough to test leaderboards when you're only one person.

1920
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:32,340
So you know, you could wait till February 26 and buy it.

1921
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:37,300
Or I could just gift it to everybody in chat right now.

1922
02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:41,060
And yeah, you guys can help me test the leaderboards.

1923
02:06:41,060 --> 02:06:42,060
Oh, snap.

1924
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:43,060
All right.

1925
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:44,780
Well, sign me up, my friend.

1926
02:06:44,780 --> 02:06:47,020
I definitely want to check that out.

1927
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:50,420
And you know, hopefully you'll get through this process in this couple weeks, some other

1928
02:06:50,420 --> 02:06:54,440
like good feedback, like obviously, you know, I think you've heard the message on the flashing

1929
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:58,940
thing loud and clear, you know, and yes, there'll be other things perhaps that maybe you didn't

1930
02:06:58,940 --> 02:07:01,220
even think of that other folks will discover as well.

1931
02:07:01,220 --> 02:07:05,380
And that'll help you make it even better product for when this releases.

1932
02:07:05,380 --> 02:07:06,620
I'm excited for you.

1933
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:12,140
Yeah, I mean, the anti epilepsy thing that's going at the top of my list, I'm going to

1934
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:15,140
get that done quick and then game balance.

1935
02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:22,860
But yeah, if you are on Twitch right now, watching, just expect a whisper from me within

1936
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:25,020
about five minutes with a code.

1937
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:32,820
And please go ahead and try just the standard mode in mouse or touchscreen just so that

1938
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:37,900
the yeah, I get at least 10 things on a leaderboard so I can try scrolling pages and make sure

1939
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:38,900
it works.

1940
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:39,900
All right.

1941
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:43,340
Well, if you really I know what if you really want to give me money for the game.

1942
02:07:43,340 --> 02:07:47,040
Yeah, if you really want to give me money for the game instead, then just don't redeem

1943
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:48,040
the code.

1944
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:50,320
You can pass it to somebody else if you'd like.

1945
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:51,540
What if we want to do both?

1946
02:07:51,540 --> 02:07:53,640
What if I want to play it now but still give you money?

1947
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:59,040
Is there is there like a PayPal a coffee a patreon something?

1948
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:07,040
If you go to my personal website, hi, Aaron calm, I believe, either on the front or on

1949
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:09,640
the helpful code page.

1950
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:15,400
There's a PayPal link where I say if you want to contribute to my daughter's college fund,

1951
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:16,600
you can do it there.

1952
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:17,600
Perfect.

1953
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:20,200
Or just go by super multitasking if you haven't already.

1954
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:22,200
Yes, that you absolutely should do.

1955
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:23,200
Oh, s2100.

1956
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:24,200
I'm out with a great point.

1957
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:25,840
Buy the game for a friend.

1958
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:26,840
Perfect.

1959
02:08:26,840 --> 02:08:28,200
You can do that.

1960
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:29,680
I mean, cool.

1961
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:30,680
Thank you.

1962
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:31,680
All right.

1963
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:32,680
Well, thank you.

1964
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:33,680
Why?

1965
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:38,000
Why are you've been a huge supporter of the show for a long time and I yeah, I can't that

1966
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,720
you know what you know what our pals over at gamertag radio, they might have got an interview

1967
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:45,520
with Phil Spencer this week, which is a great thing.

1968
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:46,720
We're really happy for him.

1969
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:52,120
But you know, we got we got everybody a free YY our game who's listening to you know what

1970
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:54,760
sometimes sometimes we get to do special things here as well.

1971
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:58,200
I will take it very happy to have you here.

1972
02:08:58,200 --> 02:08:59,600
And I'll just mention real quick.

1973
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:00,600
If you have a Mac.

1974
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:01,600
I'm sorry.

1975
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:02,600
The Mac build isn't up yet.

1976
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:04,240
Hopefully within a few days.

1977
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:07,580
Dark Sakura left a little early tonight, so you're safe for now.

1978
02:09:07,580 --> 02:09:08,580
But get working.

1979
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:09,580
All right.

1980
02:09:09,580 --> 02:09:11,860
No, I've been working on it.

1981
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:14,440
It's been a little tricky, but I got it running today.

1982
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:15,440
Oh, good.

1983
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:16,440
Well, that's great.

1984
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:17,440
You're even considering it.

1985
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:18,920
I'm sure she'll be happy to hear that.

1986
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:19,920
All right.

1987
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:20,920
Cool.

1988
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:26,180
Thank you as always for allowing me to plug my stuff and thank you for the giveaway.

1989
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:27,180
Why?

1990
02:09:27,180 --> 02:09:28,180
Why are that's amazing.

1991
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:30,400
I hope the testing proves very fruitful for you.

1992
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:31,400
Yeah, me too.

1993
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:32,400
All right.

1994
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:33,400
Take care.

1995
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:34,400
Thanks for being here.

1996
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:35,400
Welcome.

1997
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:36,400
Yep.

1998
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:37,400
Have fun.

1999
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:41,000
Oh, one more thing, because I need to ask, because you know, this is on my mind.

2000
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,920
Can I live stream the game before it releases?

2001
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:44,920
Sure.

2002
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:45,920
Go right ahead.

2003
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:48,760
And that goes for anybody else in the chat.

2004
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:50,880
If you want to stream the game, go right ahead.

2005
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:51,840
Nice.

2006
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:52,840
Look at that.

2007
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:53,840
Exclusives for you streamers out there.

2008
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:54,840
All right.

2009
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:55,840
Well, thanks.

2010
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:56,840
And thanks for listening to the feedback too.

2011
02:09:56,840 --> 02:10:01,040
It's a really great thing to be able to have that live and interactive and be receptive

2012
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:02,040
to that.

2013
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:03,040
So thanks, my friend.

2014
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:04,040
And you know what?

2015
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:06,160
I don't think that should be just an option in the options menu.

2016
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:10,680
I think something should appear when you run the game for the first time that says, you

2017
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:12,780
know, are you sensitive to flashes?

2018
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:14,560
Do you want to turn this off?

2019
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:17,040
Like I don't even want to give them the chance to get a seizure.

2020
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:18,880
I want them to turn it off right away.

2021
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:22,160
So yeah, I'm going to get on that.

2022
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:23,160
Love it.

2023
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:24,160
This call was such a win tonight.

2024
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:25,160
This is such a win.

2025
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:26,160
I guess so.

2026
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:27,160
Love it.

2027
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:28,160
Take care, my friend.

2028
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:29,160
Hey, have a great week.

2029
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:30,160
All right.

2030
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:31,160
You too.

2031
02:10:31,160 --> 02:10:32,160
Bye bye.

2032
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:33,160
Yep.

2033
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:34,160
Bye bye.

2034
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:35,160
All right.

2035
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:36,160
All right.

2036
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:37,160
Awesome to hear from YYR.

2037
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:41,240
I'll leave open the green room there if anybody else wants to get in there very quickly.

2038
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:45,400
And yeah, I love the obsolete woman in chat says, as an epileptic, I want to thank you

2039
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:46,400
for taking this seriously.

2040
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:47,400
Heck yeah.

2041
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:50,680
Like, you know, and this is, this is when we talk about like accessibility and games

2042
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:54,880
and all that stuff, you know, sometimes it's not always the first things that come to mind

2043
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:55,880
necessarily.

2044
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:59,560
Like I, I totally understand the effect YYR was going there for with the, you know, cause

2045
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:02,600
like when you play duck hunt, the screen flashes when you do it.

2046
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:07,320
But yeah, like, you know, obviously like, Oh, now that everything is like high def and

2047
02:11:07,320 --> 02:11:10,600
stuff, it might have a different kind of effect in some people and so forth.

2048
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:16,000
So I think it's, it's great that, you know, he's like so quick to go, Oh, Oh crap.

2049
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,240
We do need to do something about that.

2050
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:18,240
Don't we?

2051
02:11:18,240 --> 02:11:19,240
And he's going to get on that.

2052
02:11:19,240 --> 02:11:21,520
So I made a game like sharpshooter one time.

2053
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:27,080
What's that in click and play long time ago, it was a game called shoot first, ask questions

2054
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:28,080
later.

2055
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:29,960
I remember something like this.

2056
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:30,960
Yes.

2057
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:35,320
But, uh, that got lost at the winds of time unfortunately.

2058
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:39,640
Cause I don't even, I, one, I didn't even have anything that I think click and play

2059
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:40,640
could run on too.

2060
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:43,480
I have no idea where that those files are anymore.

2061
02:11:43,480 --> 02:11:47,080
And they like, that's like four or five computers ago.

2062
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:48,080
Yeah.

2063
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:49,080
So, all right.

2064
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:50,880
Um, well I don't see anybody else in the green room.

2065
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:53,800
I'll give it just a couple more minutes just in case I want to check in and see if there's

2066
02:11:53,800 --> 02:11:59,200
any last minute stories though, before we, uh, close up shop for a real, um, no, not

2067
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:00,200
really.

2068
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:05,420
I mean, there was a, uh, like at this art, I saw this, uh, story about some Korean TV

2069
02:12:05,420 --> 02:12:11,800
special called meeting you where they're talking about this woman meeting her, uh, rip of the,

2070
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:17,680
they recreated her daughter who had died, um, her seven year old daughter.

2071
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:19,240
And it just seems all sorts of creepy.

2072
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:22,480
I mean, cool that she wanted to do that, but no thanks.

2073
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:23,480
So.

2074
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:24,480
Huh?

2075
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:30,400
Well, this, it kind of goes back to the art is expression games or art type of thing where

2076
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:34,580
even though it might be like very uncomfortable, um, if this is how somebody wants to kind

2077
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:39,640
of grieve and be expressive, it's a very, it's a unique way to do that.

2078
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:40,920
We'll say that, you know?

2079
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:43,360
So yeah, very, very different.

2080
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:48,840
Um, now Shane is in our chat room, uh, or shad stars, it cause he goes by on Twitch

2081
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:52,880
saying new space channel five trailer came out and it's awesome.

2082
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:53,880
Yeah.

2083
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:54,880
You know what?

2084
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:58,520
I saw the tweet just before we went live tonight, so unfortunately I haven't seen it yet, but

2085
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:01,060
uh, I'm very, this is the VR one if I'm not mistaken.

2086
02:13:01,060 --> 02:13:05,540
So there's a trailer for that out there and I'd honestly, I'm sure the trailer is great,

2087
02:13:05,540 --> 02:13:09,000
but I don't need a trailer to convince me I'm going to buy the game right out the gate

2088
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,000
anyway.

2089
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:14,240
Um, yeah, I'm very excited to see that that is happening.

2090
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:15,240
Very cool.

2091
02:13:15,240 --> 02:13:16,240
All right.

2092
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:18,300
Well, it doesn't look like we have any, um, oops, it doesn't look like we have any further

2093
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:22,040
calls on discord tonight, so we'll go ahead and close it up over there.

2094
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:25,440
And I think with that, we'll probably move to a wrap up for the night.

2095
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:28,860
So, um, that does it for another week here at orange launch radio.

2096
02:13:28,860 --> 02:13:32,120
Thank you guys for tuning into our program and checking us out.

2097
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:35,240
If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, help us spread the word because

2098
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:36,960
we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2099
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:40,760
But if the game, if the voices aren't here to put out on the air, then, uh, you know,

2100
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:42,240
we can't get them.

2101
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:44,360
So, uh, support independent broadcasting.

2102
02:13:44,360 --> 02:13:46,880
Of course, I think is a clear message from tonight as well.

2103
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,960
Um, uh, and help us spread the word about OLR for sure.

2104
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:54,640
A nice five star review on a place where you can get this show such as iTunes goes an awful

2105
02:13:54,640 --> 02:13:57,600
long way, or even just like sharing the Spotify link to the show.

2106
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:00,880
Cause we're on Spotify now, if you haven't heard on social media, that type of stuff

2107
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:02,880
goes a very long way.

2108
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:03,880
So thank you.

2109
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:05,920
Thank you for everybody that participates with that.

2110
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:08,200
And with that, we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.

2111
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:10,160
Um, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2112
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:14,560
Uh, my final thought is I need to work more on my game.

2113
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:19,600
Uh, my final thought tonight is, uh, you remember the survivor LARP I talked about last summer

2114
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:20,600
that I ended up winning?

2115
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:21,600
Yeah, yeah.

2116
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:23,480
So they finally started the next cycle of that.

2117
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:27,720
So there's 18 new people playing that just started two nights ago, but this time I'm

2118
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:28,720
on the other side of it.

2119
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:32,240
I'm helping to run the game, although I'm not doing nearly as much as the other hard

2120
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:33,680
working people behind the scenes are doing.

2121
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:39,040
I'm just kind of lending my personality and stuff where I can, uh, but it's so interesting

2122
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:40,400
to watch from the other side.

2123
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:45,560
And that being said, I probably have about 45 notifications on Skype right now.

2124
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:47,520
I need to go clear out at some point.

2125
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:48,520
All right.

2126
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:49,520
That's it.

2127
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:51,160
Thank you guys for checking out the show and listening.

2128
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:52,160
Good night everybody.

2129
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:56,240
And we will see you in seven days to talk more games and the news of the week.

2130
02:14:56,240 --> 02:14:57,240
Have a great week, everybody.

2131
02:14:57,240 --> 02:14:58,240
Happy gaming.

2132
02:14:58,240 --> 02:14:59,240
Good night.

2133
02:14:59,240 --> 02:15:02,560
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

2134
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:08,520
Orange lounge radio is a production of OLR studios to join us for a live show.

2135
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:16,440

See you next week.
